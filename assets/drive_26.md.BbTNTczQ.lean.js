Parsons originally moved to Juneau in 1972 to become the city's first Director of Parks and Recreation. He served on the Assembly of the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska, during the 1980s before being elected mayor in 1991. Parsons declined to seek re-election for a second term, Instead, Parsons devoted his attention to the defeat of a 1994 statewide ballot initiative, which would have moved the Alaskan state capital from Juneau to Wasilla. He has been widely credited with the rejection of the proposal by voters. Biography In 1972, Parsons moved to Juneau from Kent, Washington, to become the first Director of Parks and Recreation. He then worked for the city as a civil servant in various roles throughout the 1970s. Parsons then served on the Assembly of the City and Borough of Juneau, from 1981 until 1989. Parsons was elected Mayor of Juneau on October 2, 1991, with 64% of the vote. Parsons also spearheaded a campaign to form an informal committee to improve the quality of life in Juneau. The committee, which became known as the Alaska Committee, was created in 1994. He later served as its chairman. He declined to seek a second term in 1994. Instead, Parsons focused on the defeat of a 1994 ballot initiative, which would have moved the state capital from Juneau to Wasilla, in Southcentral Alaska. Parsons campaigned statewide against the initiative. He traveled throughout Southeast Alaska to encourage the high voter turnout needed to defeat the measure. Parsons has been credited with defeating the proposed move to Wasilla, which voters rejected by a margin of 116,277 (54.7%) to 96,398 (45.3%). According to Christopher Clark, who worked for Parsons as his Anchorage field coordinator against the 1994 initiative, \\"He helped organize it. He'd go out door-to-door. He'd give speeches. He'd talk to editorial board meetings. He‚Äôd go to newspaper interviews. And it all worked. Jamie was with me in Anchorage on the night of the election returns and we were jubilant. We once again had dodged a bullet and managed to keep the capital here in Juneau and Jamie deserves a lot of the credit for that.\\" Parsons proposed an idea to televise live coverage of the Alaska Legislature, similar to C-SPAN. His proposal developed into \\"Gavel to Gavel Alaska,\\" which originally aired on KTOO-TV. Parsons also served as the CEO of the Juneau Chamber of Commerce from 2001 to 2003. He departed in Chamber in 2003 after his wife, a retired elementary school teacher, accepted a two-year teaching position at the Cairo American College. In 2000, Parsons attempted to reclaim his former job as Mayor of Juneau. On October 3, 2000, Parsons was narrowly defeated in the general election by Sally Smith by just 209 votes. Smith received 4,820 votes, while Parsons garnered 4,611 votes. Jamie Parsons battled multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, for more than 10 years, following a diagnosis in 2005. He died from the disease at his home in Mercer Island, Washington, where he had been undergoing treatment, on December 26, 2015, at the age of 74. He was survived by his wife, Mary Beth Parsons, and three children, Rob, Sara and Andrew. His memorial service was scheduled to be held at Centennial Hall in Juneau on July 16, 2016.

Nouailhetas was born at Cercoux on 17 December 1894, the second son and child of Louis Nouailhetas, an engineer officer in the navy, and Marie-Anne-Fran√ßoise Bertet. He entered the √âcole Navale in 1913. He received two citations during World War I (1914‚Äì18). In 1925, he left the navy to join the colonial service. His first posting was as an adjutant (adjoint) at L·∫°ng S∆°n. In 1927, he was promoted the rank of administrator (administrateur) in charge of Tuy√™n Quang Province. He later served as chief of staff (chef de cabinet) to the governor of Cochinchina and then administrator of B·∫øn Tre Province and C·∫ßn Th∆° Province (1933‚Äì36). Between 1936 and 1939 he was the secretary-general (secr√©taire g√©n√©ral) to the Governor General of Indochina. In August 1940, following the fall of France, he was named by the Vichy government to replace Ga√´tan Germain as governor of French Somaliland. He flew into the colony, already threatened with a British interdict, on 2 September. On 18 September the British established a blockade and on 25 September they bombed the capital, Djibouti, from the air. This was the prompt for Nouailhetas to institute a brutal reign of terror. Europeans suspected of contact with the enemy were interned at Obock, while 45 others were condemned to death or forced labour, mostly in absentia. On 7 May 1941, Nouailhetas issued circular letter No. 457, which ordered any native caught carrying a message from the anti-Vichyists (British or Gaullist) to be shot by a firing squad. That month, six illiterate Somalis were shot without trial as \\"Gaullist traitors\\" to set an example. On 8 June 1941, the British gave Nouailhetas an ultimatum: they would lift the blockade and provide one month's worth of provisions if the colony declared for De Gaulle; otherwise the blockade would be tightened. Nouailhetas wrote to British authorities on 15 June about the high rate of infant mortality owing to malnutrition in the territory, but he rejected the British terms. When negotiations resumed with Nouailhetas later in the summer, the British offered to evacuate the garrison and European civilians to another French colony upon surrender. The French governor informed them that he would destroy the colony's railroads and port facilities before surrendering. All these negotiations came to nothing. In September 1942, on account of reports of his brutality and intractability, Nouailhetas was recalled to Vichy and forced to retire without a pension. Following the war, he escaped to Portugal. During the post-war √âpuration, he was sentenced to death in absentia. He returned to face a military tribunal and was acquitted on 17 July 1953, which sparked outrage in Djibouti. He died in obscurity in 1985.

He was Permanent Secretary of the Department of Energy from 1985 to 1989, and of the Department of Trade and Industry from 1989 until his retirement in 1996. Early life and education Gregson was born on 28 June 1936 in Haworth, Yorkshire, England. He was the only child born to Lillian and Walter, a local school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to Nottingham, Nottinghamshire. In 1947, he won a scholarship to Nottingham High School, then an all-boys independent school in Nottingham. He ended his time there as head boy of the sixth form and vice-captain of the school. Gregson won an open scholarship to study classics at Balliol College, Oxford, and matriculated in 1955. He achieved a first in Mods (Latin and Greek language and literature) in 1957, and a first in Greats (specialising in philosophy and ancient history) in 1959. He therefore graduated from the University of Oxford with a double first-class honours Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1959. He was active in the Oxford Union, the university debating society, though he never stood for an elected office. Career Having achieved such a high class degree, Gregson's college tutor recommended an academic career, but only if he couldn't find an alternative. After graduating, he joined the civil service where he spent most of his career and never entered academia. =Military service= After university, Gregson was called up to complete his National Service. On 7 September 1959, he was commissioned into the Royal Army Educational Corps as a second lieutenant (on probation); his commission was confirmed in May 1960. He served as an education officer attached to the Sherwood Foresters. On 1 October 1961, he was transferred to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers, thereby ending his full-time service in the British Army. He was promoted to lieutenant on 7 March 1965. Gregson later said that he learnt more about leadership and management during his military service than in the first few years in the civil service. =Civil Service career= In 1959, Gregson sat the civil service exam and scored highly enough to be selected for the elite Administrative Class of Her Majesty's Civil Service. However, he did not start working as a civil servant immediately. Instead, he served in the British Army for two years as part of National Service. In 1961, Gregson joined the Board of Trade. His first job was to prepare briefs for negotiations involved in Britain's first attempt to join the European Common Market; it was unsuccessful. In 1963, he was appointed Private Secretary to the Minister of State for Overseas Development. During this 18-month posting, he spent his time organising and taking part in ministerial visits to 16 different countries. Honours In the 1983 New Year Honours, Gregson was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in recognition of his service as Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet Office. In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in recognition of his service as Permanent Under Secretary Of State in the Department of Energy, and therefore granted the title sir. In the 1996 New Year Honours, he was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross (the highest rank) of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in recognition of his service as Permanent Secretary of the Department Of Trade and Industry.

The Glaci hosted the first game of ice hockey played in Australia and was the home of the first ice hockey association in Australia. At the time the Melbourne Glaciarium was opened, it was the 3rd largest indoor ice rink in the world. The rink closed in 1957 and was soon demolished. History 9 June 1906 the opening night of the Melbourne Glaciarium. The Melbourne Glaciarium was officially opened at 3:00pm on 9 June 1906 with, then, Lord Mayor of Melbourne Sir Henry Weedon being part of the opening ceremony. It was estimated that 2500 people, invited by the directors, attended the opening of the Glaciarium, where an exhibition of \\"free skating\\" was conducted by Professor Brewer before the first general skating session in Melbourne began with 50 experienced skaters skating to the orchestral music being played. Later that evening the Glaciarium was opened to the general public and was almost over crowded. There was an exhibition of hockey played on skates which would resemble field hockey which professor Brewer and other instructors gave an exhibition of. = Architecture and specifications = The original 2 story building was constructed out of brick with a rendered facade, using tinted cement, on City Road and also had frontage on the Yarra bank. The block that the Glaciarium sat upon measured 30.48 meters (100 feet) by 60.96 meters (200 feet). The ice surface measured 54.9 metres (180 ft) by 27.4 metres (90 ft) and featured splayed corners, it was a suitable size by international ice hockey standards. There were 2 rows of reserved seating surrounding the rink surface for use at carnivals which also had heating by a network of hot water pipes running beneath the floor of these 2 rows. The west side of the venue featured a wide promenade behind the reserved seating section and behind that were the rows of general public seating. There was a designated smokers section called a \\"smokers retreat\\". The building also housed furnished ladies and gentleman's rooms both featuring offices for skate hire, administration offices and also a basement that was used as cold storage for produce. The Glaciarium was illuminated by electrical lighting and used twelve 1800 candlepower lights and in the event of an emergency, there were five 1000 candlepower emergency lights connected to a generator that could be switched on quickly. = No ice floor = In 1920, the Melbourne Glaciarium did not use the ice floor but due to the popularity of dancing it was converted into a Palais de Dance. The following year the Glaciarium arranged to meet the requirements of both dancers and ice skaters by keeping a large part of the floor for dancing. The dancing floor had enough room for an approximated 150 couples. The ice rink opened to ice skaters again on 5 May 1921 with upgrades to increase comfort. Radiators were fitted to the boxes for spectators as well as in the refreshments annex. = The Glaciarium for sale = In March 1923, the Melbourne Ice and Refrigeration Company went into voluntary liquidation. The property was sold at auction by Baillieu Allard Pty Ltd. for ¬£35500.00 to Cameron Rutherland and Seward Pty. Ltd.  Ice hockey  rightthumbBoth teams from the first Ice Hockey game in Australia, 17 July 1906. National Library of Australia From the first days of being open, the Melbourne Glaciarium was intended to be a venue to hold ice hockey among other ice sports and the formation of hockey clubs began as the Glaciarium opened. In an interview published only 2 days after the Glaciarium had opened, H. Newman Reid spoke of the formation of hockey teams. = Evolving into ice hockey = The first recorded game of ice hockey in Australia was on Tuesday July 17, 1906 and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American warship, the USS Baltimore. The game was a deviation from the ice hockey already being played in Canada, so this first game is regarded as the first step in the evolution of the Australian game into the already established game of ice hockey. The teams had been practicing for 4 weeks leading up to the game. The game was a variation of the Canadian game being played at the time, it was played in two 15 minutes halves, using a red ball the size of a tennis ball and made from gutta-percha and curved heavy-headed sticks as used in English field hockey at the time. The teams consisted of 6 men per side with the following positions: Goal-Keeper, Half Back, Center, Left Rush, and Right Rush. It is better said that this game was the first step of the Australian game evolving into contemporary ice hockey as it still differed from the already popular Canadian game at the time. At the time, the Canadian game of ice hockey was being played with a puck, and included a 7th position called a rover and was played onside - which meant that forward passing was not allowed. The McGill Rules were first published on 27 February 1877 in the Montreal newspaper, The Gazette. It was essentially the same set of rules to the already established game of field hockey and even continued to use the word within the set of rules for ice hockey. One of the defining characteristics of the game of ice hockey at the time of the first Australian game was that it used a puck instead of a ball, this distinguished it from similar stick and ball games at the time such as bandy. The American team was made up of: * Warrant Machinist F. G. Randell (team captain) - center * Seaman F. Brooks * First-class Fireman T. H. Miller - half-back * Seaman J. Benditti * First Class fireman D. F. Kelly - goal-keeper * Third Class Gunner's mate J. T. Connolly - rush The Australian team was made up of: * Herbert John Blatchly (team captain) * Dunbar Poole - center * James Service Thonemann - half back * Ramsay Salmon - left rush * Gordon David Langridge * C. Kelly Professor James Brewer was the umpire. The Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS Baltimore wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers with red socks. This game was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium and at 9:00pm a whistle blew to clear the public skaters from the ice surface so that the surface could be cleaned with scoops and brooms to remove the snowy covering generated by the public skating session before. The skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans as the American team had played as a team before against another American ship on a frozen river near Shanghai and defeated them. The Australians had never played as a team before but had the advantage of having been on the ice more recently than the American team. The game was hard fought and result of the game was a 1-1 tie. The USS Baltimore team were first to score when Mr. T.H. Miller scored goal but Mr. Dunbar Poole scored off a hard shot to tie up the game. The Great White Fleet would visit Melbourne, after having previously visited New South Wales, where they would play ice hockey against a local team, using the larger ice hockey sticks and a puck made from a disc of wood. They also played with 7 men per side, as per the Canadian rules, this would play an important part to establishing the codified version of ice hockey in Australia rather than the Australian variant played before. =First ice hockey association in Australia= Melburnians IHC 1910 - Champions 12 September 1908 is the date of the formation of the first ice hockey association in Australia in a meeting at the Melbourne Glaciarium which occurred directly after an ice hockey game between the Brighton Ice Hockey Club and the Melburnians, which resulted in a 2-2 tie. The meeting was for the purpose of organising a club for the following season and the following committee was appointed: Lorimer, Ward, Errol F. Woods, W. Purbrick and Andrew Lambert Reid. Mr. Purbrick was nominated as honorable Treasurer and Mr. Reid was nominated as the Secretary. The name of the association was the Victorian Amateur Ice Hockey Association (VAIHA). The association consisted of 4 ice hockey clubs: * Beavers * Brighton * Glaciarium * Melburnians The Glaciarium Ice Hockey Club were the first ice hockey club to form in Australia, in 1907 and they are named for the Melbourne Glaciarium as the in house representative team. The remainder of the original 3 teams were formed in 1908. The Melburnians IHC consisted of the Melbourne Grammar School field hockey team and the team was named the Melburnians after the school. The Brighton IHC team were also named after a school, Brighton Grammar School. The first state championship series in Australia was held in the Melbourne Glaciarium between 14 September 1909 - 27 September 1909. The final game was held on the evening of 27 September 1909 and was between the Glaciarium and Melburnians. The Glaciarium won the championship final by a score of 3-0 and were awarded gold medals.

According to its inscriptions, the plaque was originally attached to the king's sandal. The artifact appears in McGregor's A History of the World in 100 Objects.  Origin and description  The artefact was probably found in the tomb of King Den at Abydos ‚Äì it derives from the excavations of French archaeologist, Coptologist, and Egyptologist √âmile Am√©lineau. Today the plaque is displayed in the British Museum with the inventory number BM EA 55586. It was acquired by the museum in 1922; before that it was part of the MacGregor collection. The tablet is made of carved ivory and measures 4.5 cm x 5.4 cm; it is about 0.2 cm thick. Images are engraved and fired into it. On the front side, king Den is depicted. He wears a loincloth, a nemes headdress with a Uraeus-snake and an animal tail which hangs down from the back of his skirt. Den is labelled with his Horus name. His pose belongs to the motif of the \\"slaying the enemy\\": the king has his right hand raised, holding a mace; with his left hand, Den holds an enemy in place with his hair. The enemy is already on his knees, but attempts to ward off the king's blow. He can be identified as an Asiatic on account of his hairstyle (goatee and braids). Along the plaque we find a hieroglyphic inscription, with a left to right reading direction: \\"I was the one who completed the first strike to the east,\\" accompanied by the jackal standard of the god Wepwawet. This inscription is telling us that king Den himself conducted his first victory against the easterners. The fact that it is very important to state that it is the \\"first victory\\" is telling us that more battles will come, that other battles were lost, and that other first dynasty kings were engaged in protecting and expanding Egypt's frontiers and territories: from Nubia with the A-group to the Easteners in the north. In the Palermo stone, in its third row that it is considered to belong to Horus Den, appears in the second register \\"Smiting the bedouins\\", that it could refer to this label, but with all likelihood it refers to subsequent campaigns, since this one happened in the second half of Den's reign. Remarkable to learn is that in this plaque we have the earliest attestation for the long head-dress known as the khat-head-dress. Horus Den is also the first king known to display the double crown, indicating us that he was an innovative and active developer of royal iconography. On the other side of the plaque, a pair of sandals are depicted, although the left part is severely damaged by abrasion. References  Bibliography  Wolfgang Helck.

Starring MS Priyadi, Ermina Zaenah, , and Djauhari Effendi, the film follows a wealthy young man who passes as a chauffeur to convince a village woman to fall in love with him. Plot Kadir (MS Priyadi), a rich young man from the city, falls in love with Rukyah (Ermina Zaenah), a beautiful maiden from the countryside. During their first meeting, however, Rukyah treats Kadir roughly; since her mother (Roos Itjang) married a rich man who later manipulated and abused her, she considered all rich people to be untrustworthy. To gain Rukyah's affections, Kadir passes as a chauffeur. He is supported by his uncle, Abdul Sjukur (), but challenged by his spoiled sister Khalsum (Yaya Hidayati). Kadir's parents, however, Abdul Wahab (Djauhari Effendi) and Yatimah (Aminah Hardy), are too busy with Abdul Wahab's business dealings to support their children. Rukyah is accused of stealing a necklace by Kadir's mother and runs away. Kadir, upon discovering that the necklace's owner had simply misplaced it, chases after Rukyah and is able to find her. In the end, the two are able to marry and live happily ever after. Production Supir Istimewa was produced for Persari Film Corporation by Djamaluddin Malik.

Early life  Alexey Vladimirovich Nemkov was born on 30 March 1919 in Dzhankoy in the Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic to a working-class family. He graduated from eighth grade and became the assistant secretary of the Dzhankoy branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1938. Nemkov became a member of the CPSU in 1939, and was conscripted into the Red Army in October of that year.  World War II  Nemkov fought in combat from September 1941. In 1943, he graduated from a company commanders' course. He became a company commander in the 118th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 37th Guards Rifle Division. During Operation Bagration, Nemkov's company reportedly advanced 300 kilometers. On 25 August, his company was reportedly first to break into German trenches during the battle for the village of Zalye. The company reportedly killed 20 German soldiers.

It consisted of a circular nave about six metres in diameter with a semicircular apse with a central window. The walls are one metre thick. Almost the whole church survived until 1757, when most of it was demolished to provide stone for the new parish kirk, which has also now been demolished.

He had joined the Austrians in the Austro- Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18, and after the victorious war and occupation of central Serbia (the Kingdom of Serbia) he was given the rank of obor-kapetan, governing Kragujevac, and commanding the Serbian Militia (1718‚Äì39) alongside Vuk Isakoviƒá. In peace-time, he was sent to what is today Montenegro to incite an anti-Ottoman rebellion; a short-lived uprising broke out in which his personal unit participated. In 1734‚Äì35 he founded the Draƒça Monastery in Kragujevac. When the Austro-Russian‚ÄìTurkish War (1735‚Äì39) broke out, Serbs were mobilized and Mlati≈°uma led forces in numerous campaigns. He is regarded as a hero and enumerated in Serbian epic poetry. Early life According to Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija, Stani≈°a Markoviƒá was born in a village below the Ostrog monastery, in Bjelopavliƒái (present day Montenegro). His family hailed from Novi Pazar. With the failure of the Austro-Serbian campaign during the Great Turkish War (1683‚Äì99), a large migration of Serbs ensued into Habsburg territories in 1690. Career =Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18= He joined the Habsburg side during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18, which saw the second occupation of central Serbia (Sanjak of Smederevo) after the Habsburg- occupied Serbia (1686‚Äì91). The Serbs established a Hajduk army that supported the Austrians. Upon the peace treaty and establishment of the Kingdom of Serbia (1718‚Äì39), Mlati≈°uma received the rank of obor-kapetan of Kragujevac. =Interwar period= He was sent to the Highlands (Brda), to incite rebellion in eight tribes: Vasojeviƒái (led by vojvoda Vuksan Bojoviƒá), Bratono≈æiƒái, Drekaloviƒái (led by Radonja Petroviƒá), Piperi, Rovce, Bjelopavliƒái, Pje≈°ivci, and Lutovci. Petroviƒá was according to sources the leader of these tribes, who could ready 2,000 men in one day. Mlati≈°uma arrived in Kuƒçi in 1729. He met with Radonja Petroviƒá with whom he sought to mobilize Brda against the Ottomans. When talks were underway between Radonja Petroviƒá and the Austrian feltmarschal, an uprising broke out in Montenegro. Radonja's rebels and Serbian troops, and an auxiliary force of Mlati≈°uma, attacked the local Muslims. According to the Serbian plan, they were to take over Novi Pazar, Ro≈æaje, Bijelo Polje and Peƒá. He founded the Monastery of Draƒça in Kragujevac, completed on 5 October 1734. There is a ktetor portrait of him. =Austro- Russian‚ÄìTurkish War (1735‚Äì39)= A new war broke out, and the Serbian Militia and Mlati≈°uma were mobilized. The Military Governor notified the people of the organization of the Militia in Serbia to set up outposts along the Habsburg‚ÄìOttoman border. The population quickly responded, and, beside the regular army under the two ober-kapetans and fifteen (unter-)kapetans, 13 companies of \\"hajduks\\" were collected, who were to be used for protection of the border and other services. The army was divided into 18 companies, in four groups. The most notable obor-kapetans were Vuk Isakoviƒá from Crna Bara, Mlati≈°uma and Kosta Dimitrijeviƒá from Paraƒáin. In Kragujevac, there were two companies of 500 soldiers each. His forces attacked U≈æice. Mlati≈°uma's forces liberated Kru≈°evac on 20 July 1737 and carried much cattle. Colonel Lentulus ordered that part of the cattle be returned to the population, the second part was sent to Sekendorf, the third held by the colonel to the need of his army. On 7 January 1739 he led attacks in Morava and Rudnik. He had settled 1,000 Christians in Habsburg territory after the war, during what is known as the \\"Second Great Migration\\". He was imprisoned in 1740, and is believed to have died the same year. Legacy He is enumerated in Serbian epic poetry, collected by Vuk Karad≈æiƒá (1787‚Äì1864). Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija (1791‚Äì1847) wrote about him. The ≈†umanoviƒá brotherhood in Crna Bara claim kindred.

Early years Max Bonnafous was born on 21 January 1900 in Bordeaux, Gironde. He graduated from the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1920, studied at the French Academy in Rome, and passed the agr√©gation in philosophy in 1924. He joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). He made substantial contributions to the Ann√©e sociologique, nouvelle s√©rie, which first appeared in 1925. He became a professor at the lyc√©e in Constantinople. Bonnafous planned a thesis on suicide. He published Le Suicide √† Constantinople: Etude statique et essai d'interpr√©tation sociologique in 1927. Bonnafous was appointed to the chair of sociology in the University of Bordeaux in 1930, and held this position until 1940 but did not produce significant work on the subject. In 1929 Bonnafous undertook to edit the selected works of the socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s (1859‚Äì1914) in about twenty volumes. He chose to organize the material around six themes: socialism, pacifism, anti-clericalism, political battles, economic and social questions, and the world and men. The first volume was published in May 1931, and nine volumes appeared before 1939. The outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì45) interrupted the work, and his files were scattered during the German occupation of France. He said that afterwards he did not have the courage or the opportunity to reassemble them. In October 1933 Bonnafous published N√©o- socialisme ? ordre, autorit√©, nation in which he contributed the preface and commentary to important speeches by Marcel D√©at, Adrien Marquet and Barth√©l√©my Montagnon at the Congress of Paris. They argued that Socialists must focus on defeating fascism, and to do so must gain the support of the middle classes and eliminate unemployment. Strong national states were necessary to control and direct the economy. Socialists must study and learn from the \\"intermediary regimes\\" of economic and social organization being tried in Italy, Germany, Russia and America, which were neither purely Socialist or purely Capitalist. Forty deputies were expelled from the SFIO at a special congress of the Socialist Party on 5 November 1933, most because they refused to accept the ban on participation in cabinets led by Radicals. Bonnafous, Marcel D√©at, Adrien Marquet, Barth√©l√©my Montagnon and others were among the Neo-Socialists who were expelled. Their slogan \\"Order, Authority, Nation\\" was repugnant to the Socialist leader L√©on Blum. Bonnafous served as cabinet secretary to government ministers in 1934 and 1938. World War II When the war broke out in 1939 Bonnafous, in Bordeaux, was one of the five sociology professors in France. In 1940 he chose to collaborate with the Vichy regime. Bonnafous was cabinet secretary to the Minister of the Interior in 1940. He was then appointed a prefect. Bonnafous was Secretary of State for Agriculture and Supplies from 18 April 1942 to 11 September 1942 in the 2nd cabinet of Pierre Laval. He was Minister and Secretary of State for Agriculture and Supplies from 11 September 1942 to 6 January 1944 in the same cabinet. His wife, H√©l√®ne S√©rieux-Bonnafous, was a psychiatrist. On 4 December 1942 his secretariat allocated a significant increase in rations to the inmates of lunatic asylums. Bonnafous tried to speed up the creation of the Peasant Corporation, which would unite rural producers in France and give them the apparatus of self- government. The body that was eventually established in 1943 no longer had broad support among the peasants and was too late to make any real change. Later career After the Liberation of France Bonnafous was condemned to national disgrace, but was soon pardoned due to his service to the Resistance. However, he retired from political life. He had an affair with the actress Gaby Morlay (1893‚Äì1964) during the war, and as a result the actress was investigated for collaboration with the Nazis after the liberation. Later Bonnafous married Morlay, who continued to play important roles in the 1940s and 1950s. Max Bonnafous died at the age of 75 on 16 October 1975 in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes.

The novel was first published in 1940.  Plot  Hajari, a middle-aged Bengali Brahmin is the male protagonist of the novel. He works as a cook in a hotel owned by Bechu Chakraborty near Ranaghat railway station. Here customers are often cheated and Padma, a maid at the establishment, steals the hotel's food. Hajari is strictly against these, but being just a cook, he does not have right to say anything. Here he is regularly mocked and insulted by Padma, who, though only a maid, is the owner's paramour and has immense influence over him. Hajari dreams to start his own hotel, but for that he needs Rs.200. Kusum is a young widow, whom Hajari considers as his daughter. One day utensils of Hajari's shop are stolen and police arrests Hajari. Following this incident, he loses his job. After getting a loan from Kusum and Atashi, a girl from his village, Hajari starts his own hotel. Here he works hard with dedication and sincerity. In just a year his hotel becomes the most popular hotel of the area. Two other hotels of the area: one of Bechu Chakraborty and another of Jadu Banerjee almost get shut down. Hajari also gets a railway tender to manage a government-run hotel in the railway platform. At the end of the novel, Hazari signs a contract to manage a large hotel and goes to Bombay. Before leaving, he appoints Bechu Chakraborty (whose own hotel was sealed recently) as a manager of the market area hotel. He also gives Padma a job, who used to insult him every now and then.

The exact family relationships of the various Neville family members in the 12th and early 13th centuries are difficult to understand and distinguish.

Heinz Peter D√ºrsteler: Sprachliche Neusch√∂pfungen im Expressionismus. Thun 1954. = Structure of the poem = The poem is constructed out of two stanzas with always four verses.

The first one is accentuated with masculine cadences, the second one with female cadences. = Title, topic, motif = Train accident The title Weltende means the same as end of the world or end time, but van Hoddis used it ironically, because the proper meaning is natural catastrophe, which is actually the poem's subject matter. The main motif is the struggle between two opposing forces: the first nature and the so-called second nature, build up by mankind with the material of the first one.Cf.

Despite of all technological mastery of nature, in moments of a natural catastrophe we got the feeling ‚Äönature strikes back‚Äô and we are often objectively no more able, to control the situation: we become victims. That roof tilers ‚Äûbreak in two‚Äú (vers 3) is a way we normally use to speak about fragile puppets. This can be taken as a pointer to the apodictic fact that van Hoddis deals with a dichotomy. One the one hand there is seriousness of the apocalyptic title and some mentioned fatal happenings (vers 3, vers 6, and vers 8), on the other hand there is‚Äî as a sharp contrast to all that‚Äî the playfullness of the poem, what is obviously full of irony. Therefore, R√ºhmkorf rightly speaks of ‚ÄûWestentaschenapokalypse‚ÄúCf. Peter R√ºhmkorf: Zur Teilnahmslosigkeit erstarrt. In: Gedichte und Interpretationen, Frankfurter Anthologie, vol.

Versions and pitfalls of translating  To have introduced van Hoddis‚Äô poem Weltende into the Anglo-American literary scene has been the merit of Michael Hamburger, British poet and translator.German Poetry 1910-1975. An Anthology in German and English. Selected, translated and introduced by Michael Hamburger. Carcanet New Press/Manchester, United Kingdom in 1977, p. 83. However, his version breaks the given rhyme scheme of the original's first stanza (the embracing rhyme) and fails to capture its female cadences in the second stanza. And the use of the word jetties‚Äîeven if they are ‚Äûbig‚Äú‚Äî instead of the word Deiche (dams), extenuates the original's power of imagery impermissibly .Cf. Natias Neutert: Foolnotes.

The settlement was also known as the Camden Harbour Expedition, as well as the Government Camp. Ships known to have transported people to the settlement included Calliance, which was wrecked on its shores. A number of families settled and explored from this location, however it did not continue after 1865. The Sholl family were one of such families that were part of the community. Camden Harbour was visited in June 1865 by the crew of the tiny Forlorn Hope, who were well received by Government Resident Robert J. Sholl and Government Surveyor James Cowle, but found them and other settlers, many from Victoria, despondent and weary. The ground was hard and stony and the grass of little value to the few remaining sheep, who were weak and dying. As the crew left they witnessed the burning by Victorian settlers of Calliances hull, to recover her copper sheathing. Charles Smith Bompas was dismissed as Camden Harbour's doctor by Sholl around October 1865, having only been there about a month. Bompas left the settlement on Kestrel shortly after. The location has been visited in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by Kimberley cruise ships.

Built about 1781, it is believed to be the city's oldest surviving building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It now houses a bed and breakfast inn. Description and history The Todd House stands at the northeast corner of Capen Avenue and Water Street, north of the city center, and overlooking the St. Croix River. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. Its south-facing facade is symmetrical, with the front entrance topped by a transom window. Inside, it follows a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule in front of the chimney that also has a winding stair to the attic level, and parlor spaces on either side. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the building. The house's exact construction date is unknown; it is assumed to be the single house located on Moose Island on a 1781 navigational chart. Its earliest recorded owner is John C. Todd. Moose Island (where most of Eastport is located) was first settled in 1772 by fishermen. In 1801, the house was adapted for use by the newly formed local Masonic lodge, using the attic-level space as a meeting hall. When Eastport was occupied by British forces during the War of 1812, some of their officers were quartered here. Returned in 1818, it continued to be used by the Masons until 1887, when they moved to a purpose-built hall.

Italy continues to prohibit U.S. offensive strikes from Italian territory, and also reserves to itself the right to veto any U.S. mission. ;2 January * Indian aerial surveillance platforms detect a group of gunmen entering an Indian Air Force base at Pathankot, India, and Indian Air Force security forces exchange fire with them in a housing area. Four of the gunmen and two Indian Air Force security personnel are killed. Gunfire erupts again two hours later, and Indian helicopters fire on gunmen in the base later in the day. Indian security forces finally declare the base secure in the late afternoon, 14 hours after the intrusion began. ;3 January * Combat again breaks out at India's air base at Pathankot after security forces discover two militants still hiding on the base. Security forces reportedly kill the militants. * An official at the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa announces that by mutual agreement with the Government of Ethiopia the United States had shut down its military unmanned aerial vehicle base at Arba Minch Airport in Arba Minch in southern Ethiopia in September 2015.

It is the first public announcement that the base had been closed. ;4 January * Saudi Arabia's civil aviation authority suspends all civilian flights between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The move, which comes a day after Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Iran, raises doubts about the future ability of Islamic pilgrims from Iran to visit Mecca and of Shiite pilgrims from Saudi Arabia to visit religious sites in Iran. * John Boggs files suit against William Merideth for shooting down his unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Bullitt County, Kentucky, with a shotgun as the UAV hovered over Merideth's property, asserting that the drone was in public airspace when it was shot down and requesting $1,800 in damages and clarification as to how high above private property public airspace begins. Merideth had claimed the UAV was spying on his family and violating his privacy. The case promises to spur the U.S. judicial system to clarify where private property rights end and federal jurisdiction begins in U.S. airspace, with a significant potential impact on future private and commercial UAV operations. ;5 January * When two United States Air Force Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters attempt to evacuate wounded Afghan military personnel near Marjah, Afghanistan, one strikes a wall and is disabled and the other is ordered to abort the mission under heavy ground fire.

An SDF spokesman disputes the claims of civilian deaths, saying that the strikes have killed large numbers of Islamic State personnel, and that the Islamic State has simply buried them quickly and falsely claimed that civilian deaths have occurred. The U.S. military announces that U.S. aircraft have conducted 18 strikes in the Manbij area over the previous 24 hours ‚Äì out of 450 in the area since May ‚Äì and that it is launching an investigation to determine whether the allegations of civilian casualties are true.

International air carriers have accumulated about $4,000,000,000 in almost worthless bol√≠vars which the Government of Venezuela prohibits them from converting into hard currency, prompting various airlines since 2014 ‚Äì including Aerom√©xico, Air Canada, Alitalia, LATAM, and Lufthansa ‚Äì to cease service to Venezuela and others to reduce flights or provide service with smaller planes; only Venezuelan airlines are permitted to pay for fuel with bol√≠vars, all other carriers being required to pay in United States dollars. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Airport in Caracas, long a major hub for airlines serving South America, has been replaced in that role by airports such as El Dorado International Airport in Bogot√°, Colombia, which now handles three times as many passengers as Caracas, and Jorge Ch√°vez International Airport in Callao, Peru, which has enjoyed a 35 percent increase in passengers over the previous two years. Caracas has become so dangerous that Copa Airlines crews are prohibited from leaving their hotel rooms when staying there, massive shipments of cocaine originating in Caracas have been interdicted in the airport's terminal, and gunfights between police and criminals occur every few months in the airport's parking lots. * A medical transport plane crashes in northern California in the United States.

Delta joins American Airlines and United Airlines in arguing that they should be selected for such routes to reduce the disadvantage they face when competing with Emirates, the UAE's Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, and Qatar's Qatar Airways, all of which receive substantial subsidies from their governments. The GSA responds that JetBlue offers cheaper prices that Delta, American, and United and that its selection does not violate the Fly America Act, regardless of its use of foreign codeshare partners for the routes. ;1 August * The Government of Singapore restructures its Air Accident Investigation Bureau to establish the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau as an independent government agency responsible for investigating aviation and marine accidents and incidents in Singapore. * Syrian rebels shoot down a Russian Mil Mi-8 (NATO reporting name \\"Hip\\") helicopter in Syria's Idlib Governorate during fighting around Aleppo, Syria, killing all five people on board.

Neither of the reports can be verified, and later in the day Nigerian forces claim merely to have seriously wounded Shekau in the strike. ;24 August * Turkish Army forces enter Syria to assist Free Syrian Army troops in capturing Jarabulus from the Islamic State. Turkish Air Force and U.S. aircraft conduct airstrikes in support of the offensive. * The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announce that they have cleared their forces of wrongdoing in two airstrikes against targets in the Gaza Strip that killed civilians during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. They find that a 20 July 2014 airstrike that killed seven members of one family at the refugee camp in Bureij was justified because the house was in use as a Hamas military command-and-control center and because the strike killed a senior Hamas commander and three members of the family who were Hamas members; that a 1 August 2014 airstrike against a house in Rafah that killed 15 members of one family also was justified because the house was in use by Hamas as a military command-and-control center; that international law permits attacks on houses used for military purposes; and that one of the dead family members in the 1 August strike was a senior Hamas commander. The IDF also finds that the deaths of 12 members of a family in Rafah on 21 July 2014 were due to Palestinian mortar fire rather than an Israeli airstrike. ;25 August * A weeklong search in the Federated States of Mirconesia for a couple aboard a missing sailboat ends when a United States Navy helicopter investigating a report from the previous evening of a light seen on uninhabited Fayu Atoll discovers a large \\"SOS\\" drawn in the sand and spots the couple waving.

The loud noises mistaken for shots turn out to be harmless, and the man dressed as Zorro, who tells police he had come to meet an arriving passenger, is released. * American reality television personality Darrell Ward, a star of the television series Ice Road Truckers, and his pilot are killed when their Cessna 182 Skylane Skylane (registration N9936T) crashes on a highway and catches fire while trying to land at an airstrip at Rock Creek, Montana, at the end of a flight from Missoula, Montana. ;29 August * Iranian state television reports that Iran has put into operation the Nazir radar system, which it claims can detect radar- evading aircraft, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles flying at altitudes of over . * The first nationwide regulations governing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (popularly known as \\"drones\\") go into effect in the United States. They apply only to commercial-purpose UAVs weighing or less including payload, and require that the UAVs fly only during daylight, remain within sight of their operators, not fly directly over people not involved in their operation, fly no higher than an altitude of , and fly no faster than ; operations outside these parameters require a waiver from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). They also require that UAV pilots pass a written test of aeronautical knowledge administered by the FAA to receive an FAA certification to operate UAVs ‚Äì the FAA has received about 3,000 requests for such certifications ‚Äì although UAV pilots are not required to possess a formal license. The regulations do not apply to privately owned UAVs operated by hobbyists. They also do not address the operation of UAVs over private property, although the FAA recommends that UAV operators receive the permission of property owners before operating UAVs over their property and specific permission to take photographs and videos over their property if the UAVs are to be used for those purposes. ;30 August * The Islamic State announces that its chief spokesman, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, has been killed in an airstrike. The U.S. Department of Defense reports that it targeted Adnani in a \\"precision strike\\" in Al-Bab, Syria, with an AGM-114 Hellfire air-to- ground missile fired by an unmanned aerial vehicle but says it cannot confirm his death. On 31 August, Russia will claim that a strike by a Russian Federation Air Force Sukhoi Su-34 (NATO reporting name \\"Fullback\\") killed as many as 40 Islamic State personnel on 30 August, one of whom was Adnani, but offers no evidence for its claim. * Joe Sutter, the American engineer known as the \\"father of the 747\\" who served as chief engineer for the design and development of the Boeing 747 in the 1960s, leading a team of 4,500 people including 2,700 engineers, dies at the age of 95. ;31 August * An airstrike in Saada, Yemen, by the Saudi-led coalition kills at least 16 civilians.

Later strikes in the sequence of air raids on the well reportedly kill first responders attempting to help the wounded from earlier strikes. * In Geneva, Switzerland, United States Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov announce a ceasefire agreement between the United States and Russia intended to lead to a negotiated settlement that will end the Syrian Civil War. The ceasefire between the Syrian government and opposition groups is to begin at sundown on 12 September. If the ceasefire holds for seven days, the agreement as outlined by Kerry calls among other things for the protection of civilians in Syria from airstrikes, for the United States and Russia to make arrangements to conduct coordinated airstrikes in Syria against Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State, and for the Syrian Arab Air Force to resume combat missions only over yet-to-be-selected areas that contain no rebel forces. * Syrian Arab Air Force jets strike a busy market in Idlib, Syria, killing at least 36 people, and various neighborhoods in Aleppo, Syria, killing at least another 45 people.

The strike destroys approximately six ground vehicles according to a United States Central Command estimate before Russia alerts Central Command that the strike is targeting Syrian Arab Army forces; the aircraft then cease fire and the United States express regret over the strike. Russia and Syria claim that the targeted forces were fighting against the Islamic State and that the strike killed 62 Syrian soldiers and wounded 100. It is the first combat engagement between the U.S.-led coalition and Syrian forces since the coalition began air raids in Syria in 2014. Arguing that the strike is a ceasefire violation that may be evidence of U.S. military support for the Islamic State in the Syrian Civil War, Russia calls an emergency Saturday-evening meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. ;18 September * The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan conducts two airstrikes against a highway in Afghanistan's Urozgan Province on the outskirts of Tarinkot in support of Afghan forces in combat against the Taliban.

At the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry accuses Moscow of inventing its \\"own facts\\" to explain the air attack, which the United States had blamed on the Russian Federation Air Force, adding that \\"We don‚Äôt get anywhere by ignoring facts and denying common sense;\\" he calls for Russia and Syria to \\"immediately ground all aircraft\\" flying in areas of northwest Syria where the convoy was hit. * The United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control grants Airbus and Boeing licenses to sell airliners to Iran. Airbus's license covers the first 17 A320s and A330s that Iran agreed to purchase in a January; although based aboard, the company required U.S. Government permission because at least 10 percent of the airliners' components are manufactured in the United States. Boeing's license allows it to sell 80 airliners and lease another 29 new Boeing 737s to Iran. ;22 September * Throughout the day, suspected Syrian Arab Air Force and Russian Federation Air Force aircraft strike targets in rebel- held areas of Aleppo, Syria; twenty-one people die in evening air raids on two Aleppo neighborhoods, and scores have died in airstrikes in the city since 19 September. At the U.N. Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry repeats his 21 September call for Syria and Russia to ground their aircraft in northeastern Syria, saying that \\"the only way\\" for the Syrian ceasefire to succeed is \\"if the ones who have the air power in this part of the conflict simply stop using it... . Absent a major gesture like this, we don‚Äôt believe there is a point in making more promises, issuing more plans.\\" The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, United States Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford, tells the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services that \\"I would not agree that coalition aircraft ought to be grounded...I do agree that Syrian regime aircraft and Russian aircraft should be grounded...There's no reason to ground our aircraft...We‚Äôre not barrel-bombing civilians; we‚Äôre not causing collateral damage.\\" * The World Trade Organization (WTO) rules that the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom have failed to halt illegal subsidies to Airbus that the WTO had ordered them to stop in 2011 despite reporting in late 2011 that they had done so. The WTO adds that the subsidies ‚Äì which total $22,000,000,000 over ten years ‚Äì have cost the economy of the United States tens of billions of dollars and cost Boeing nearly 400 potential airliner sales in 2012 and 2013 alone. The ruling is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace industry, which has disputed European aircraft subsidies for 40 years and first filed a complaint with the WTO about Airbus subsidies in 2004. ;23 September * After the Syrian government announces an offensive against rebel forces in and around Aleppo, Syria, the previous evening, Syrian government aircraft pound rebel-held areas of Aleppo during the day, conducting more than 70 strikes and dropping at least 100 bombs. Observers describe the strikes during the day as the most intense of the Syrian Civil War. Targets include at least three of the four Syrian Civil Defense in the eastern part of the city; damaging fire trucks and ambulances; two of the centers are knocked out. More than 70 strikes have hit the Aleppo area since 21 September; since the collapse of the ceasefire in Syria on 19 September, airstrikes have killed scores of people, including at least 30 in Aleppo. ;24 September * Syrian and Russian airstrikes against rebel-held areas in and around Aleppo, Syria, continue to escalate, reaching levels unseen previously in the five-year Syrian Civil War, with reports indicating at least 92 people killed since dawn.

Since 19 September, the strikes have destroyed so many ambulances that humanitarian aid workers and first responders have great difficulty responding to reports of casualties. At the U.N. Security Council, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power accuses Russia of \\"barbarism\\" and claims the strikes are a war crime, while the Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, responds that the collapse of the ceasefire is due to transgressions by U.S.-backed rebel forces. ;26 September * In the first week since the collapse of the ceasefire in the Syrian Civil War, Syrian and Russian aircraft have dropped at least 1,700 bombs on the rebel-held eastern portion of Aleppo, Syria. * The Russian government announces that it has radio location data implicating the Ukrainian armed forces in the destruction of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 and has ruled out the possibility that a surface-to-air missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine shot the airliner down. ;27 September * The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration demonstrates its Next Generation Data Communications (also called \\"Nexcom\\" or \\"Data Comm\\") system ‚Äì a component of its Next Generation Air Transportation System ‚Äì to the media at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. The system, already installed at air traffic control towers at 45 airports in the United States, is intended to replace the existing archaic U.S. system of communications between airline pilots and control towers ‚Äì which requires printing out flight plans in towers, discussion by radio between towers and pilots, and pilots writing down flight plans by hand in the cockpit ‚Äì with all-digital communications, allowing improved speed and efficiency. The FAA plans to install the system at 50 more U.S. airports before the end of 2016, and then to install it at en route air traffic control centers across the United States, with a goal of achieving voiceless, in-flight communications between air traffic controllers and airliner pilots throughout the country by mid-2019. The FAA estimates that the new system will save air carriers $10,000,000,000 over the next 30 years. ;28 September * An Afghan official announces that an early-morning airstrike against a residential building in the Achin District in eastern Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province has killed 13 civilians. U.S. military forces in Afghanistan acknowledge that they carried out a \\"counterterrorism airstrike\\" in Achin and aare investigating whether any civilian casualties resulted from it. * The United States conducts a predawn airstrike in northern Somalia in defense of troops from Somalia's Puntland region who report that they have come under fire from al-Shabaab forces. Post- strike photographs show two burned-out armored vehicles and a number of badly burned bodies at the scene of the strike. A U.S. Department of Defense spokesman claims that the strike killed nine al-Shabaab members and a Puntland police officer says it killed more than a dozen al-Shabaab personnel, while officials of Somalia's Galmudug autonomous region claim that Puntland had tricked the United States into attacking Galmudug soldiers and that the strike had killed 22 of them. The U.S. Department of Defense announces that it will investigate whether the strike killed anyone other than al-Shabaab personnel. * During the predawn hours, airstrikes hit two hospitals and a bakery in eastern Aleppo, Syria. Both hospitals are put out of action, and two patients are killed. * The United States Department of State announces that the United States is making preparations to suspend all bilateral cooperation with Russia over Syria ‚Äì including the sharing of information between the United States and Russia to support airstrikes against terrorist targets in Syria via a \\"Joint Implementation Center\\" ‚Äì unless Russia takes steps to end the ongoing Syrian and Russian ground and air assault against rebel-held eastern Aleppo and moves to restore the ceasefire agreed to on 12 September. The announcement states that in a telephone conversation earlier in the day with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry \\"made clear that the United States and its partners hold Russia responsible for the situation, including the use of incendiary and 'bunker buster' bombs in an urban environment, a drastic escalation that puts civilians at great risk\\" and \\"informed [Lavrov] that the United States is making preparations to suspend U.S.-Russia bilateral engagement on Syria ‚Äì including on the establishment of a Joint Implementation Center to coordinate [air]strikes on terrorist targets ‚Äì unless Russia takes immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo and restore the cessation of hostilities.\\" * A Dutch team investigating the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine in July 2014 announces that it has concluded that the airliner was shot down by a surface-to-air missile fired by a Russian-made Buk missile system (NATO reporting name \\"Gadfly,\\" U.S. Department of Defense designation SA-11) smuggled from Russia into an area of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists a few hours before it fired at the airliner and returned to Russian territory the following day. The Dutch team says that it has identified over 100 people linked to the firing of the missile and that it will continue its investigation ‚Äì extended into at least 2018 ‚Äì ‚Äìin order to determine who ordered it fired. The U.S. Department of State notes that the Dutch team's findings match those of American investigators, while the Russian ministries of defense and foreign affairs dismiss some of the Dutch team's evidence and declare its investigation biased and Russian separatists in Ukraine claim they have no access to sophisticated surface-to-air missiles and blame the airliner's destruction on the Ukrainian armed forces. * \\"Unauthorized...activity\\" by an unmanned aerial vehicle near Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), forces the airport to halt all arrivals and departures. Arrivals resume after about 35 minutes and full operations after about 67 minutes. The incident prompts UAE officials to announce plans to tighten the country's regulations regarding drone operations. A similar incident had caused the airport to close on 12 June. ;29 September * United Nations officials condemn the 28 September U.S. counterterrorism airstrike in Afghanistan's Achin District, saying it killed 15 civilians and wounded 12 others; they demand a complete investigation of the incident. Although the United States and the Afghan government claim that the strike targeted a residential compound used by Islamic State personnel, local Afghan officials claim that it killed and injured only civilians. U.S. military officials respond that they take \\"all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously\\" but add that the Islamic State continues \\"to put innocent lives at risk by deliberately surrounding themselves with civilians and dressing in female attire.\\" * The Government of Somalia accuses the United States Government of killing 13 Somali soldiers in its 28 September airstrike against al-Shabaab forces and demands an explanation from the United States. * Russia responds to U.S. criticism of its air campaign in eastern Aleppo, Syria, by saying that the airstrikes are justified because the United States violated the ceasefire agreement of 12 September by failing to fulfill its promise to separate al-Qaeda- and Islamic State-linked forces from other rebel forces and because the ceasefire agreement had become unacceptable because it a;;owed \\"terrorist groups to take necessary measures to replenish supplies [and] regroup forces.\\" ;30 September * Russian and Syrian aircraft conduct heavy airstrikes against rebel-held residential areas in eastern Aleppo, Syria, including the use of white phosphorus and cluster munitions; two more hospitals are among the targets hit during the day. The World Health Organization estimates that Russian and Syrian airstrikes have killed 338 people in Aleppo since 19 September.

The first meeting was held in 1926 in New York City, USA, and has had 8 meetings happen in its 90-year history. This is an official meeting of World Federation of Orthodontists (WFO). History 1st International Orthodontic Congress was held in 1926 in New York City, USA. It was the first worldwide congress ever held by a dental speciality at that time. Dr. William Fisher was the first President of the International Orthodontic Congress (IOC). He was also the President of American Society of Orthodontists (ASO). The ASO was celebrating its 25th anniversary of its founding in 1901. At that time, the International Congress consisted of fifteen orthodontic societies. 2nd International Orthodontic Congress was held in 1931 in London, England. Dr. J.H. Badcock was the President of 2nd International Congress, in addition to helming the Presidency of European Orthodontic Society (EOS) and British Society for Study of Orthodontics (BSSO). 3rd International Orthodontic Congress was to be held in 1938 in Montreal, Canada. Due to the tensions of WWII and death of Dr. Fisher, the 3rd international congress did not take place in Montreal. For next three decades, due to Korean and Vietnam War, the organization of the Congress was further delayed. Eventually the 3rd IOC was held in 1973 in London. Dr. William J. Tulley was the President of 3rd IOC. Dr. B.F. Dewel then served as Vice- President of IOC. 4th International Orthodontic Congress was held in 1995 in San Francisco, USA. Dr. William H. DeKock organized the 4th IOC. During this meeting, World Federation of Orthodontists (WFO) was created. The WFO acted as an accrediting body for orthodontic specialists throughout the world. After Dr. DeKock contacted many different Orthodontic societies around the world by sending them the bylawas of WFO. Ultimately 68 national and regional orthodontic societies signed the charter of World Federation of Orthodontics in San Francisco on May 15, 1995. 5th International Orthodontic Congress was held in Chicago, USA in 2000 along with the 100th session of the American Association of Orthodontists. 6th International Orthodontic Congress was held in Paris, France in 2005 along with Societe Francaise d‚ÄôOrthopedie Dento- Faciale and Syndicate des Specialistes Francais en Orthopedie Dento-Faciale. 7th International Orthodontic Congress was held in Sydney, Australia in 2010 and was sponsored by Australian Society of Orthodontists. 8th International Orthodontic Congress was held in London, England in 2015 and was hosted by the British Orthodontic Society.

On Metacritic, the series holds a rating of 54 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or above average reviews\\". Maureen Ryan of Variety gave the first season a negative review, writing, \\"The animated HBO show has a lot in common with programs like Girls, Louie and Baskets, and like Togetherness, it boasts Mark and Jay Duplass as executive producers. But the extraordinarily tedious Animals., unlike those shows, fails to hit any of its chosen targets. It is unfunny, its animation is unexceptional and the studied banality of its dialogue is excruciating.\\" Conversely, David Wiegand in the San Francisco Chronicle gave the season a positive review, writing, \\"The deadpan approach only enhances the delicious off the wall comedy of Animals. The series is batty and brilliant as it turns the whole notion of anthropomorphic cartoon animals on its fuzzy ear.\\" See alsoRoom 104 *Togetherness References External links * Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American animated comedy television series Category:2016 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:English-language television shows Category:HBO original programming Category:Television series by Duplass Brothers Productions Category:Animated television series about birds Category:Animated television series about cats Category:Animated television series about dogs Category:Animated television series about horses Category:Animated television series about insects Category:Animated television series about squirrels Category:Television shows set in New York (state) ","title":"Animals (American TV series)"},{"id":"48980083","text":"Elections to Colchester Borough Council were held on in 1978 alongside local elections across the United Kingdom.

History View of Karin Grech Garden Before the creation of the garden the site consisted of natural fauna and flora, used as agricultural land from the times of the Romans until the middle of the 20th century, and since then rehabilitated as a public garden. Before, during and mainly after the Second World War several Maltese and British families flocked out of Valletta, the Three Cities of Cottonera and the surrounding suburbs and moved to San Gwann as a general consequence of the war; they moved out initially to avoid the bombardment targeting the Grand Harbour area. With the growing population in San ƒ†wann, Maltese politicians and the community have pushed for a public garden to provide a recreational area. The garden was for many years the only urban public garden in San ƒ†wann, with other gardens having been created over time. The garden was built in the memory of Karin Maria Grech in 1981. In March 2020, the playing field was damaged due to a car chase crash on site.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/teenagers-arrested-after-car- chase-face-35-charges-denied-bail.777122 Naming of the garden Karin Grech Monument The garden was initially referred to simply as il-gnien (the garden) for some time, before being named the Karin Grech Playing Field (ƒ†nien Karin Grech).

The website's critical consensus reads, \\"As stark and riveting as its cinematography, I, Olga Hepnarov√° takes a sober, haunting look at the life leading up to a woman's horrific real-life crime.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Glenn Kenny wrote review for The New York Times, \\"Anchored by a startling performance by Michalina Olszanska, the Czech film ‚ÄúI, Olga Hepnarova‚Äù is an austere, hypnotic story of sadness, madness and murder.\\" He ends his review, \\"Early in the movie, Ms. Olszanska, a slight, narrow- shouldered woman, plays Olga as someone trying to recede into herself, slumping and looking to the ground as she puffs on a cigarette. By the time of her trial, at which she pleads guilty and demands the death penalty, she is stiff, straight, defiant. Modern civilizations are haunted by crimes like this; ‚ÄúI, Olga Hepnarova‚Äù persuasively suggests that the only understanding we can have of them is a terrifying one.\\" Writing for The Village Voice, Tanner Tafelski said \\"I, Olga Hepnarov√° is a bitter pill to swallow, focusing on the paradoxes of a misanthrope\\".

Discovery of protactinium Protactinium was first identified in 1913 by Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth G√∂hring at the University of Karlsruhe. The new element was called brevium due to the short half-life of the isotope specific studied, Protactinium-234 (234 Pa). Fajans and G√∂hring also worked to identify as many isotopes of the new element as possible, and also to publicize their discovery‚Äîa process that was hampered by the onset of World War I. In 1914, G√∂hring was conscripted into the army. Presumably he perished during the war; he is listed as the author of no further scientific articles or publications after 1915.

Description and history Mallett Hall is located on the east side of Hallowell Road (Maine State Route 9), just north of its junction with Dyer Road and south of Bradbury Mountain State Park. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It has a symmetrical front facade, with a slightly projecting central bay flanked by window bays. The centrally-located entrance is a double door flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and gabled pediment, and there is a tall Palladian window on the second level above. The projection is capped by a pedimented gable (echoing in proportions the main gable, which is also pedimented) with an inset half-round window. The interior's most elaborate feature is a freestanding central staircase, which is flanked by office spaces, and leads to the second-floor auditorium. A smaller meeting space is located behind it on the first floor. The hall was built in 1886, and is one of the small rural community's most architecturally sophisticated buildings; its architect is not known, but may be Portland architect Francis Fassett. In addition to housing town offices and functions, it has also served as a community center, hosting social events.

He studied for a degree in Physical Education & Sports Science at Loughborough University, playing for Loughborough Students and transferring to Rugby Lions whilst at University. On completing his studies Holley gained employment at CCTA (now Coleg Sir Gar) and signed as a fullback for Aberavon RFC until an injury sustained in a match in 1994 against South Africa which saw him forced to end his playing career at the age of 24. During his time as a sports lecturer at Carmarthenshire College, Holley devised a two-year national diploma course in Rugby Studies in 1998. Holley took the concept with him to Hartpury College in Gloucestershire, where he became the college's first Director of Rugby. Between 2000 and 2003, Holley was the head coach of the Gloucester RFC Academy. Holley joined the Ospreys regional team at their formation in 2003, as assistant coach working under Lyn Jones. When Jones left the region in May 2008, Holley took charge of the region for the 2008‚Äì09 season. He remained Head Coach until 2012 winning 5 major trophies with the Region. Holley was appointed as assistant coach for the Wales national team's 2009 summer tour of North America, with responsibility for defence. The opportunity arose as regular defence coach Shaun Edwards, along with two other Wales coaches, were unavailable due to their participation in the 2009 Lions tour to South Africa. The 2009‚Äì10 season saw Scott Johnson join the Ospreys as Director of Rugby, with Holley remaining at the region as head coach. Holley left the Ospreys in February 2012 by mutual agreement. After providing short-term cover at the Scarlets regional team while Mark Jones was away assisting the Wales national side during the 2013 Six Nations tournament, Holley joined Bristol Rugby as first team coach ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season. He renewed his contract with Bristol in April 2015. Bristol gained promotion to the English Premiership under Holley's leadership at the end of the 2015/16 season beating Doncaster in their third play off final in as many years. On 24 June 2016, he and Bristol Rugby parted company by mutual consent. Media work Following his departure from the Ospreys in February 2012, Holley has worked as a pundit and analyst on BBC Wales' rugby programming including Scrum V. In June 2012, Holley was approached by Town & Country Broadcasting regarding hosting a radio show about rugby. The first series of the show, titled Rugby Nation and broadcast on Nation Radio along with other Town & Country stations across South Wales started in August 2012. Rugby Nation was nominated in the Best Sports Programme category at the 2013 Sony Radio Academy Awards, and won the bronze award in the category. Holley now works regularly not only for the BBC and Nation but also for BT Sport, Talksport and Sky Sports. He has recently collaborated with award-winning education technology company Aspire2Be to devise a new programme for schools called iBroadcast. He is an Ambassador for the charity Rugby For Heroes as well as the Velindre Cancer Centre and works closely with sports travel company Venatour.

He was sired by Bering, who won the Prix du Jockey Club and finished second to Dancing Brave in the 1986 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As a breeding stallion, his other offspring included Pennekamp, Glorosia, Peter Davies (Racing Post Trophy) and Matiara (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). His dam Wells Fargo was an unraced daughter of Sadler's Wells :died at the age of five soon after producing American Post, who was her only foal. Wells Fargo's dam Cruising Height was a successful racehorse and broodmare, finishing second in the Lancashire Oaks and producing several other winners including High and Low who won the Cheshire Oaks and finished second in the St Leger. She was descended from the broodmare Madrilene, the ancestor of several other good winners including High Top and Old Vic. The colt was sent into training with Criquette Head-Maarek at Chantilly. Racing career =2003: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, American Post was beaten a short head by Ximb in a contest for previously unraced colts and geldings over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 31 July. After a six-week break he returned at Longchamp Racecourse in September and started 1.8/1 favourite for a minor event over 1400 metres. Ridden as on his debut by Olivier Peslier he turned into the straight in fourth place, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by two lengths from Dealer Choice. Richard Hughes took over the ride when the colt was stepped up to Group One level for the Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere over the same course and distance on 5 October. Despite its status, the race attrated only six runners, none of whom had won at Group race level. Ximb was made favourite ahead of the Listed race winner Charming Prince and the Aidan O'Brien-trained maiden race winner Tycoon, with American Post fourth in the betting on 4/1. The other two runners, Newton and Acropolis were also trained by O'Brien. After behaving poorly before the start, American Post was settled in third behind Charming Prince before making a forward move in the straight. He went to the front 300 metres out and drew clear of his opponents to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. Doncaster Racecourse, where American Post won the Racing Post Trophy No winner of the Prix Jean-Luc Lagadere had ever won the Group One Racing Post Trophy in England, but American Post attempted to break the trend when he started 5/6 favourite for the British race over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 25 October. His owner had to pay a supplementary entry fee of ¬£17,500 as the colt had not been among the original entries for the race. His three opponents were the O'Brien- trained Magritte, the Autumn Stakes winner Fantastic View and the 16/1 outsider Tahreeb. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon he raced in second behind Magritte before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and three quarter lengths. Fantastic View took second ahead of Magritte and Tahreeb. Apart from completing the unique Longchamp- Doncaster double, American Post became the first French-trained winner of the race since the Alec Head-trained Green Dancer in 1974. After the race Criquette Head said He's a very talented colt. He didn't have to race today, he's done nothing, really. He did everything so easily\\" whilst Soumillon commented \\"He travelled easily following the leader and showed a good turn of foot when I asked him. He went a little bit to his right inside the final furlong, but I would put that down to being a bit babyish. He is very good\\". Criquette Head-Maarek later explained the improvement in the colt's behaviour at the start compared to his unruly attitude at Longchamp: \\"I gave a carrot to a handler at the stalls and American Post followed it into his berth\\". =2004: three-year-old season= American Post began his second season in the Listed Prix Omnium II over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 31 March and started odds-on favourite against four opponents. After disputing the lead from the start, he broke away from his rivals in the last 150 metres to win by four lengths from the Alain de Royer-Dupr√© trained Joursanvault. After the race Head-Maarek described American Post as the \\"perfect type\\" for The Derby and bookmakers made him second favourite for the race behind Yeats. In April the colt again started odds-on favourite when he contested the Group Three Prix de Fontainebleau over the same distance at Longchamp. His three opponents on this occasion were Diamond Green (the undefeated winner of the Prix La Rochette), Antonius Pius (Railway Stakes) and Blackdoun. Ridden by Soumillon he led from the start before accelerating in the last 200m to win by a length from Antonius Pius who was subsequently disqualified for hampering Diamond Green. Head-Maarek commented \\"American Post was given a lovely ride and did not have a hard race. That is exactly what I wanted\\". Longchamp Racecourse, where American Post won two Group One races After five consecutive victories, American Post, with Hughes in the saddle, started odds-on favourite for the Group One Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp on 16 May. Diamond Green, Antonius Pius and Newton were again in opposition whilst the other three runners were Byron (Mill Reef Stakes), Ershaad and Sunday Doubt. American Post rced in third place as Newton set the pace before moving up to challenge in the straight. The closing stages were closely contested and extremely rough, with Bryon taking the lead before Antonius Pius took over and looked certain to win before veering right into the rails, hampering Diamond Green in the process. In a blanket finish, American Post took the lead 50 metres out and prevailed by half a length from Diamond Green with Byron, Ershaad and Antonius Pius just behind. Criquette Head-Maarek admitted that her colt had been a lucky winner saying \\"I was disappointed because he would have been second and he was beat\\" and expressing the view that American Post had been unsuited by the firm ground. For his next race, American Post was stepped up in distance for the 225th running of the Epsom Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 5 June. Ridden by Hughes was made the 13/2 third choice in a fourteen-runner field behind the Dante Stakes winner North Light and the 2000 Guineas runner-up Snow Ridge. After turning into the straight in fourth he moved up to second place approaching the last quarter mile but weakened in the closing stages and finished sixth behind North Light. American Post made his final racecourse in the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp in September. He disputed second place early in the straight but dropped away quickly and finished tenth of the eleven runners behind the filly Grey Lilas. His retirement was announced in November. Head-Maarek commented \\"We've retired him as he's had a problem with a hind hock. He was a very good horse and had rather a special but appealing personality. He had his own ideas and we had to tempt him into the stalls with a carrot\\". Stud record American Post was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Haras d'Etreham before moving to Haras National Treban in 2015. The best of his offspring have included Robin of Navan (Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud), Liliside (disqualified after winning the Poule d'Essai des Poulains), American Devil (Prix du Palais- Royal). PedigreeAmerican Post was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Americo won the Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation's Super Lightweight title in only his second recorded professional fight, and in only his third fight, he became the first Indonesian (at the time, East Timor had not gained independence from Indonesia) fighter to challenge for a world title, when he fought World Boxing Council Super Lightweight (Junior Welterweight) champion of the world, Saoul Mamby. In becoming the first Indonesian to fight for a world title, Americo became also the first boxer from East Timor to do so. Professional boxing career Thomas Americo began boxing professionally on April 19, 1980, taking on the far more experienced, Australian Eddie Buttoms, who had 60 wins, 13 losses and 7 draws (ties) but who was nearing the end of his own boxing career. This fight took place in Malang, and Americo upset his opponent with a ten round decision win, after which Buttoms retired. In his next fight, Americo was pitted against hot prospect Sang Mo-Koo of Busan, South Korea. Mo-Koo was being touted as a possible world title challenger for Mamby's WBC crown and had a record of 21-1-2, with 13 knockout wins. This bout was held on August 15, 1980 at Jakarta. Once again, Americo upset a far more experienced rival by knocking the South Korean out in round eight to win the OPBF Super Lightweight title. With these two upset wins, Americo became ranked by the WBC in the Super Lightweight division and got the world title chance that Mo-Koo was expected to receive next. =World Title challenge= Next, Americo challenged the world traveling, WBC world Super Lightweight champion Saoul Mamby. Mamby had fought in Puerto Rico, Canada, Jamaica, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Thailand, France, Curacao and South Korea besides fights in his native United States (he would later also fight in Nigeria, Mexico, Guyana, Spain, Zambia and the Cayman Islands as well). Mamby was 30-12-5 with 14 knockouts coming into their bout, compared to Americo's 2-0 with one knockout. Mamby-Americo was the first world title fight ever held in Indonesia. The bout was held on August 29, 1981, exactly 1 year and 2 weeks after Americo's prior fight. It took place at Jakarta's Bung Karno Stadium. After 15 torrid rounds, Americo did enough to have Japanese judge Takeo Ugo score the bout a draw at 146-146, but lost on the scorecards of Italian Marcello Berlini by 147-139 and Mexican- American Rudy Ortega by 146-141, therefore losing the fight by a majority decision. =Rest of career= Next, Americo faced another world-caliber fighter, former WBC world Super-Lightweight Champion, South Korean Sang-Hyun Kim. This bout was held on December 20, 1981 at Daejeon, South Korea, marking the first time Americo boxed abroad as a professional. Americo lost the bout, and with it recognition as OPBF Super Lightweight champion, by a twelve round decision. Next, Americo went to Sydney, Australia, to face Australian veteran Jeff Malcolm, 57-19-9, as part of a boxing undercard topped by a fight between Paul Ferreri and John Feeney. This boxing card has the peculiarity of being the only one ever held at the world famous Sydney Opera House. On April 2, 1982, Americo suffered his third loss in a row, beaten on points by Malcolm. Thomas Americo next faced a list of mostly unremarkable foes, with a combined record of 28-19-4 before retiring from boxing. The possible exception was Rocky Pirottina, who was 16-3-2 when he and Americo faced off on April 4, 1984, and who defeated Americo on points after ten rounds. During this part of his career, Americo went 4-3-1 with 1 knockout, this being against 0-1 Agus Sabara on October 6, 1986, dispatched by Americo in five rounds. In his last fight, on June 29, 1987, Americo fought Bongguk Kendy for the Indonesian national Super-Lightweight title; Kendy was 2-1 coming in. Americo lost the bout by twelve round decision, retiring from boxing thereafter. He had a professional boxing record of 6 wins, 6 losses and 1 draw, with 2 knockout wins. Death During the last days of the Indonesian occupation of East Timor, which lasted from 1975 to 1999, acts of violence happened in the streets of Dili, Americo's hometown. Americo was a victim of one of these, being dragged from his car and shot dead by militia on September 7, 1999, shortly before East Timor gained its independence.

He has led workshops and rituals at the Rainbow Gatherings held by the Rainbow Family. Since the 1970s, he has toured the United States and Europe teaching and lecturing on the adaptation of the application of philosophy to modern problems of society, community, and relationships. Manitonquat was a member of the Assonet Band, a nonprofit corporation created in 1990 and based in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The group asserts a connection with the Wampanoag Nation but is not recognized by the state or Federal Government as a tribe, and has been criticized for not requiring proof of Wampanoag heritage as a condition of membership. Manitonquat states in his biographical notes and publicity materials that he is a spiritual elder of the band. He was associated with the prominent German intentional community ZEGG and the \\"peace research village\\" Tamera in Portugal. Teachings Manitonquat taught that individualistic society is a source of unhappiness, and that cities are dehumanizing for their residents. He argued that it is better to live in small groups, with each group able to define its own rules and practices. He advocated for self-sufficient and environmentally-friendly communities. He said \\"We're creating another world... The basic thing is: We're all equal. The basic thing is: We love this world we're on. We are the next spiritual transformation of humankind.\\" Rainbow Gatherings Manitonquat had described his involvement in early Rainbow Gatherings as being important to the development of his beliefs. Describing an early gathering, he said \\"People stayed together all day on that mountain. We fasted and remained in silence until, sometime after noon, someone started singing an Arapaho chant. All of us took up that chant to honor the traditional caretakers of that land. When we left that gathering everyone had the feeling that something very important had happened, and was happening all over the world\\".

There is a light blue-leaden metallic spot in the middle of this band, and its posterior edge margined in the disc with a blue-leaden metallic streak. A small transverse-oval orange spot is found in the disc at three-fifths, sometimes connected with the dorsum by a patch of light yellowish suffusion almost confluent dorsally with the preceding band. The hindwings are whitish-ochreous, with a rather broad pale orange costal streak of modified scales and a submedian groove containing an expansible pencil of very long pale orange hairs.Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. 18 (2): 452.

He was the son and successor of Khusrau-Shah (r. 1157-1160). Reign In 1161/2, a group of Oghuz Turks seized the Ghaznavid capital of Ghazna, forcing Khusrau Malik to retreat to Lahore, which became his new capital. From there he made incursions into northern India, expanding his rule as far as southern Kashmir. He also created an alliance with the Indian Khokar tribe. In 1170, Khusrau (or one of his commanders) invaded the southern part of the Ganges. In 1178 the Ghurid ruler Mu'izz al- Din Muhammad invaded the southern part of Ghaznavid Punjab and reached as far as Gujarat. In 1179/80 he seized Peshawar, and by 1181/2 swept around Lahore, but Khusrau Malik managed to keep him from the city by paying him. However, Lahore was finally captured by the Ghurids in 1186, while Khusrau-Malik and his son Bahram-Shah were taken to Ghur and imprisoned, marking the end of the Ghaznavid Empire.

Early life  Gene Federico was born in New York‚Äôs Greenwich Village on February 6, 1918. His family moved to the Bronx and then to Coney Island, where he attended Abraham Lincoln High School, home of Leon Friend‚Äôs Art Squad. The Art Squad exposed him to leading European Advertising artists whose inspiration would become the basis for his later work. He attended the Pratt Institute and took weeknight classes at the Art Students League in Manhattan. He graduated from Pratt in 1939. After taking his first job in Newark, New Jersey in 1941, he became a GI stationed in North Africa and Europe until November 1945.  Career  Returning from the war, Federico's work was exhibited at A-D Gallery in 1946 where he met Will Burtin, the art director for Fortune magazine. Burtin offered Federico a position as his art associate, however Federico didn‚Äôt care for editorial design and lasted only 10 months. His wife, Helen Federico worked for Paul Rand at the William Weintraub Agency, and Rand suggested he take a job at Grey Advertising. There, he met Bill Bernbach, Ned Doyle, Bob Gage, and Mac Dane. The men left to start their own agency, Doyle Dane Bernbach. Federico was best known for his work at the agency for his Woman‚Äôs Day ads. One of his most memorable ads for Women‚Äôs Day in 1953, featured a simple and elegant use of the words ‚Äúgo out‚Äù to create a bicycle. This advertisement was representative of how his work integrated text and image in a composition. His heavy reliance on typography led him to work intimately with copywriters. In the mid-1950s, he developed a relationship with Aaron Burns (at the Composing Room) who introduced him to new typefaces to experiment with in his work. His work in the late 1950s and 60s was distinctly modern and the mark of American advertising‚Äôs ‚ÄúCreative Revolution.‚Äù After a seven-year stint at Benton and Bowles, he started his own agency in 1967 with copywriter Dick Lord. Together, they founded Lord Federico (later renamed Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc.). He left the agency in 1991, to become an advertising and design consultant. Federico was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1980. He was awarded the AIGA Medal in 1987. In 1991, he was awarded the Type Directors Club medal. Federico died on September 8, 1999, in Pound Ridge, New York from prostate cancer. He was married to Helen Federico (1921-2012) and had two daughters, Gina and Lisa.

It was opened in December 1913 and is known as a notable destination for various celebrities and politicians. It is a member of The Leading Hotels of the World. History Picture of Gstaad Palace taken in 2014. In 1905, Robert Steffen, a local schoolteacher in Gstaad, purchased land on which to build a new hotel. He recruited investors from Lausanne and Geneva for the project originally called the \\"Royal-H√¥tel and Winter Palace.\\" The hotel was opened in December 1913, with a design from Dutch architect, Adrien van Dorsser. In 1915, it held a men's tennis tournament on outdoor clay courts. The tournament would eventually become the Swiss Open. Soon after the hotel's inauguration, World War I broke out in Europe, inhibiting the Palace's success at first. It saw growth in the 1920s but was again hampered by the Great Depression. Ernst and Sylvia Scherz took over as directors of the hotel in 1938. During World War II, a vault in the hotel's cellar was used to safeguard money and other valuables held by the Swiss Bank Corporation (now known as UBS). That vault is currently a fondue restaurant. Financial struggles associated with low patronage during the war prompted the hotel's majority owner to sell in 1947. The hotel has been operated by the Scherz family ever since. After the war, the hotel became a common vacation spot for royalty, including King Leopold III, the King of Afghanistan, and members of the Spanish royal family. In the 1950s, Scherz helped establish events like the Menuhin Festival Gstaad to increase business at the hotel. The following decade, he brought in prominent entertainers to perform at the hotel, including Maurice Chevalier, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Marlene Dietrich, and numerous others. Scherz's son, Ernst Andrea, took over managing duties from his father in 1968. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the hotel gained a reputation as a celebrity getaway destination. Actors like Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Sophia Loren, Grace Kelly, Roger Moore, and many others spent a great deal of time there. In the early 1970s, the hotel opened its first nightclub, GreenGo. Exterior shots of the hotel appear in the 1975 film, The Return of the Pink Panther, with Peter Sellers in his role as Inspector Clouseau. In 2000, Michael Jackson offered to purchase the hotel, but the owners declined. In 2001, Ernst Andrea Scherz handed over management duties to his son, Andrea Scherz. The hotel also added a spa to include sauna and hammam areas. In 2013 and 2014, the sixth floor suites were refurbished. It received a renovation in 2018 which incorporated more suites at the property. Description The Gstaad Palace was built in a Swiss chalet style on a hill overlooking the town of Gstaad. It has guest rooms and suites, restaurants, a basement nightclub (GreenGo), a spa, a traditional alpine hut (Walig Hut), indoor and outdoor pools, and numerous other amenities. It is a member of the independent hotel collective known as The Leading Hotels of the World.

However, rumours about rituals taking place on his property involving naked youths and blood rites received publicity in the national press, and he abruptly moved to Broughton in the Scottish Borders.Andrew Murray Scott and Iain Macleay, Britain's Secret War, p.31 Scottish nationalism Boothby became a keen Scottish nationalist, and in 1963 launched his own newsletter, Sgian Dubh. He was a founder of the 1320 Club in 1967,Hugh MacDiarmid, New Selected Letters, p.536 initially with the title \\"organiser\\",Timothy Neat, Hamish Henderson: Poetry Becomes People (1952‚Äì2002) and was soon appointed as its secretary. The club united radical nationalists, including Hugh MacDiarmid, Oliver Brown, Wendy Wood and Douglas Young. However, Boothby was unique among its members in calling for a \\"Scottish Liberation Army\\", and it was these calls which led the Scottish National Party to prohibit its members from also joining the 1320 Club.Andrew Murray Scott and Iain Macleay, Britain's Secret War, pp.28-32 Tartan Army Without the knowledge of the 1320 Club's other members, Boothby formed the \\"Army of the Provisional Government\\", popularly known as the \\"Tartan Army\\".Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.409 He took advice from Matt Lygate of the Workers Party of Scotland; Lygate did not become involved, perhaps because Boothby's other political views tended towards the far right, but Lygate publicly defended the paramilitary activities of Boothby's group.Arnold and Jackie Kemp, Confusion to Our Enemies: Selected Journalism of Arnold Kemp (1939‚Äì2002) Initially, the group had little substance, and confined its activities to hoax bomb threats and throwing bricks through windows, but in 1975 it conducted bombings at electricity pylons and oil pipelines.\\"Fringe terror with a tartan tinge\\", The Herald, 11 May 1993 This ran the group's funds dry, and members attempted a bank robbery to obtain more cash.

Huber studied law in Bonn under Carl Schmitt. He received a PhD in 1926 for a work on state church law, and his habilitation in 1931 for a work on economic administrative law, which he was instrumental in establishing as a field of study. In 1933, he was called to teach in Kiel, and subsequently also taught law in Leipzig after 1937 and in Strasbourg from 1941 to 1944. Like Georg Dahm and Karl Larenz, Huber (who joined the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933) belonged to the \\"Kiel school\\" of constitutional law, which attempted to legitimize the F√ºhrerstaat, Adolf Hitler's dictatorship, by constructing a legal structure to anchor it in the German state as the source of all legitimate power. In doing so, Huber was influential in shaping the law of Nazi Germany and in recruiting others to that task. Because of this, he was excluded from the public law scholars' association in 1956, and did not find work as an ordinary professor until 1962, when he was appointed to a chair in G√∂ttingen. After the end of the 1930s, Huber's work focused on the history of German constitutional law. This culminated in his Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789, which covered mainly Prussian constitutional law from 1789 to 1933, and was published in eight volumes between 1957 and 1990.

History In 1902 the Director of Irrigation H. T. S. Ward came up with proposals for building a new irrigation tank on the Kanakarayan Aru in northern Ceylon. Work in the tank, which had a catchment area of and was to hold of water, began in July 1902 but was delayed by the World War I. Construction was completed in 1921 and the tank was filled and spilling in November 1921. The tank was created by joining up two low lying swamps of the Kanakarayan Aru. Construction was carried out manually and the labourers were housed in a new colony - present day Kilinochchi. The tank cost Rs. 194,000 to construct. The tank's name was derived from the Tamil words for two (iranai) and pond (madu). In the 1940s a severe drought in the Jaffna islands resulted in large numbers of people migrating to the Kilinochchi area where they were given free land to farm near the Iranamadu tank. In 1951 the tank bund was raised to hold of water, increasing storage capacity to . An additional sluice was built on the right bank and the tank was extended onto lands on both banks. The bund was raised to in 1954 to give a storage capacity of . By the late 1960s the tank had a water spread are of . The bund was long. There was a controlled overflow spill on the left bank. The left bank sluice was 5 ft by 4 ft whilst the right bank sluice was 4 ft by 2 ft 8 in. The tank was capable of irrigating of land. The bund was raised to in 1975 to give a storage capacity of . Concerns were raised about the integrity of the bund during the monsoon rains of 1983. An investigation by K. Vigneswaran, Deputy Director of Irrigation, in early 1984 found that the bund was too weak to hold water higher than and so Vigneswaran ordered that water levels not exceed that amount. The tank was long, wide and in 2012. It was capable of irrigating via of channels. By 2014 the tank was capable of irrigating . Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project Jaffna peninsula, which has a population of nearly 600,000, has no perennial rivers and is heavily reliant on groundwater. Unregulated water extraction for industrial, agricultural and domestic use has resulted in acute water scarcity. The water is also polluted due to the absence of a sewerage system and seawater intrusion caused by indiscriminate limestone quarrying. In the 1960s Deputy Director of Irrigation of S. Arumugam developed the River for Jaffna project (known as the Arumugam plan), which involved diverting the freshwater discharged by the Kanakarayan Aru into the heart of the Jaffna peninsula via the Vadamarachchi Lagoon. Whilst parts of the projects were completed in the 1960s, the crucial Mulliyan channel linking Chundikkulam Lagoon with Vadamarachchi Lagoon wasn't built. In 1983 the Sri Lankan government approved the completion of the project but the outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War put an end to the plans. In 2006 the Sri Lankan government developed a new plan to supply water to Jaffna peninsula, the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply and Sanitation Project, which involved drawing water from Iranamadu Tank and transferring via pipeline to the peninsula. However, to ensure that farmers in Kilinochchi District continued to receive adequate supplies of water for irrigation, the tank bund would be repaired and raised by 2 feet to store and extract an additional 27,000m3 of water a day. A new raw water intake would be constructed near the tank's left bank main channel sluice. The raw water would then flow, under the influence of gravity, from the tank to Paranthan via a new 12 km 800mm diameter ductile iron pipe located alongside the existing left bank irrigation channel. From Paranthan the raw water would flow, under the influence of gravity, to Pallai via a new 20.5 km 600mm diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe located alongside the A9 highway. At Pallai the raw water would be treated at a new water treatment plant before being pumped, via 45 km 600mm diameter ductile iron treated water main running alongside existing roads, to 17 new and 11 refurbished elevated water towers on the peninsula, and ground sumps at Kaddudai and Araliturai. The water towers will supply water, via 520 km 63-300mm diameter unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC)/medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) pipes, to Chavakachcheri, Jaffna, Kodikamam, Kopay, Navatkuli and Pallai. The ground sump at Kaddudai will pump water, via transmission mains, to Karaitivu and Velanaitivu. The ground sump at Araliturai on Velanaitivu will then pump water, via transmission mains, onto Pungudutivu, Mandativu, Nainativu, Analativu and Eluvaitivu. The whole project, including sewerage and sanitation improvement in Jaffna, is expected to cost $164.04 million (Rs 17,880 million) of which $90 million will come from an Asian Development Bank loan, $40 million from a French Development Agency loan and the remaining $34.04 million from the Sri Lankan government. The project is expected to be completed in February 2017 and result in 60,000 new water connections benefiting 300,000 people and 20,000 mains sewer connections benefiting 80,000 people. North Central Province Canal Project In 1950s and 1960s the Ceylonese government, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization, developed the Mahaweli Master Plan to use the waters of the Mahaweli River basin to irrigate Dry Zone land in northern and eastern Ceylon, and generate electricity. The 30-year plan was to cost Rs. 6,700 million and was divided into three phases. Phase 1 (Polgolla Diversion) was constructed in the 1970s. Following the 1977 parliamentary election the new government introduced the Accelerated Mahaweli Project which shortened the period from 30 years to 5/6 years but increased the cost from Rs. 6,700 million to Rs. 15,000 million. Phase 2 (Victoria-Minipe Diversion) was completed in the 1980s but phase 3 (Moragahakanda Project) was abandoned due to water scarcity and the outbreak of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The Moragahakanda Project had originally intended to connect the Mahaweli basin to the Kanakarayan Aru via a new canal - the North Central Province Canal. A modified Moragahakanda Project commenced in January 2007 with the construction of Moragahakanda Reservoir and Kalu Ganga Reservoir. The Moragahakanda Reservoir was financed by a $558 million loan from the China Development Bank and the Kalu Ganga Reservoir was finance by loans from Japan International Cooperation Agency ($109 million) Saudi Fund for Development ($46 million) Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development ($37 million) and OPEC Fund for International Development ($16 million). The North Central Province Canal Project (NCPCP) was launched in 2015. Phase 1 of the NCPCP includes the construction of the Kalu Ganga‚ÄìMoragahakanda Transfer Canal between Kalu Ganga Reservoir and Moragahakanda Reservoir and construction of the Upper Elahera Canal connecting Moragahakanda Reservoir to existing reservoirs (Eruwewa, Huruluwewa, Mahakanadarawa and Manankattiya). Phase 1 is expected to cost $675 million of which $453 million will come from an Asian Development Bank loan, $108 million from the Sri Lankan government and the remaining $114 million from other financiers. Phase 1 is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. Phase 2 of the NCPCP includes the construction of the North Central Province Canal between Manankattiya to Chemamadu Kulam on the Kanakarayan Aru near Omanthai. Phase 2 is expected to cost Rs. 130 billion and be completed by 2029.

It was founded as a church with an adjoining priory of Dominican nuns and is a Grade II listed building.\\"The city of Stoke-on-Trent: Roman Catholicism\\" in A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 8, from British History Online (London: Victoria County History, 1963), 271-276. History =Foundation= In 1838, a Roman Catholic mission from Longton was started in Stoke. In 1841, a chapel, named St Peter's Chains, was built on Back Glebe Street. In 1850, the chapel received its own priest. In early 1851, a group of Dominicans nuns moved into Longton. In 1854, with their lease in Longton ending, they moved to the site of the present church. =Construction= In 1856, building work began on the church and the adjoining convent for the Dominican nuns. To pay for the construction, the old chapel was sold. In 1857, the new church was opened and named Our Lady of the Angels and St Peter in Chains. The convent started a girls' school at the same site. From 1864 to 1865 the adjoining building was expanded to house a boarding school and St Margaret's Home for Incurables. In 1866, the convent was designated a priory. =Extensions= From 1884 to 1885, a new chancel was built. Its architect was A.E. Purdie, who also designed Kilworth House and the chapel at Rudding Park House. Rev Dr James Northcote was parish priest at the church from 1857 to 1860 and then from 1881 to his death in 1907. In 1865, he also donated a series of Stations of the Cross from Belgium to the church. In 1905, an organ was installed. This was to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Northcote's priesthood.

It is somewhat larger than Neptune and orbits its parent star Kepler-56 and was discovered in 2013 by the Kepler Space Telescope. Planetary orbit Kepler-56b is about 0.1028 AU away from its host star (about one-tenth of the distance between Earth to the Sun), making it even closer to its parent star than Mercury and Venus. It takes 10.5 days for Kepler-56b to complete a full orbit around Kepler-56. Further research shows that Kepler-56b's orbit is about 45¬∞ misaligned to the host star's equator. Later radial velocity measurements have revealed evidence of a gravitational perturbation but currently it is not clear if it is a nearby star or a third planet (a possible Kepler-56d). Both Kepler-56b and Kepler-56c will be devoured by their parent star in about 130 and 155 million years. Even further research shows that it will have its atmosphere boiled away by intense heat from the star, and it will be stretched by the strengthening stellar tides. The measured mass of Kepler-56b is about 30% larger than Neptune's mass, but its radius is roughly 70% larger than Neptune's. Therefore, Kepler-56b should have a hydrogen/helium envelope containing a significant fraction of its total mass. Like Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the envelope's light elements are susceptible to photo- evaporation caused by radiation from the central star. For example, it has been calculated that Kepler-11c lost over 50% of its hydrogen/helium envelope after formation. However, the larger mass of Kepler-56b, compared to that of Kepler-11c, reduces the efficiency of mass loss. Nonetheless, the planet may have been significantly more massive in the past and may keep losing mass in the future.

She is known for her We Animals project, a photography project documenting human relationships with animals, which led to the We Animals Archive (a photo archive) and We Animals Media (a media agency). Through the We Animals Humane Education program, McArthur offers presentations about human relationships with animals in educational and other environments, and through the We Animals Archive, she provides photographs and other media for those working to help animals. McArthur was the primary subject of the 2013 documentary The Ghosts in Our Machine, directed by Liz Marshall, and with Keri Cronin, she is the founder of the Unbound Project, which aims to celebrate and recognize female animal activists. Her first book, We Animals, was published in 2013, and her second, Captive, was published in 2017. A third, HIDDEN, is forthcoming. McArthur has been awarded a range of commendations for her photography and activism, including the 2018 Wildlife Photographer of the Year People's Choice award. Photography McArthur was raised in Ottawa, Ontario, and studied Geography and English at the University of Ottawa. She decided to pursue photography after taking an elective course on black-and-white photography at university. She originally entered photography motivated by artistry, but her motives subsequently changed, and she instead came to see her camera as her \\"tool for creating change\\". Her earlier work photographing animals was in the genre of street photography, but she now increasingly photographs captive animals, sometimes while undercover. In 2010, the trauma of her work led to her being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, though she has since recovered. Her photographs are sometimes published anonymously. Her work has been published in a variety of media, including the newspaper The Guardian, the magazines National Geographic and Vice, and the news website National Observer. In addition, her photographs have been used by over 100 animal advocacy organizations and in academic work on human-animal relationships. McArthur appeared in the top 50 of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Champions of Change contest, and on More fourth annual \\"Fierce\\" list. She has also been awarded the Institute for Critical Animal Studies's 2014 Media Award, and the Toronto Vegetarian Association's 2013 Lisa Grill Compassion for Animals Award (with Liz Marshall). Farm Sanctuary awarded her the 2013 \\"Friend of Farm Animals\\" award, and listed her as one of their \\"Heroes of Compassion\\" in 2016. In 2018, McArthur was awarded the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People's Choice award for a photograph of Pikin, a lowland gorilla rescued from poachers by Ape Action Africa, in the arms of Appolinaire Ndohoudou, a carer, while Pikin was being transported between two sanctuaries in Cameroon. The photograph was selected by voters from a shortlist of 24 chosen by the Natural History Museum. McArthur said that she was \\"so thankful that this image resonated with people\\", hoping that it might \\"inspire us all to care a little bit more about animals ... No act of compassion towards them is ever too small.\\" She went on to win the Special Award of the Jury for the best single picture entry as a part of The Alfred Fried Photography Award 2018 for the same photograph. The jury were unanimous in their decision, and described the photograph by saying: > Jo-Anne McArthur firmly believes that animals are individuals and have > feelings. And if proof were needed she supplied it with this magnificent > picture full of tenderness. A moment when it transpires that animals too > know a feeling of safety and comfort, are able and willing to trust and need > affection. And that they recognize when it is offered to them. In the 2019 Wildlife Photographer of the Year category, McArthur's photo \\"The Wall of Shame\\" was \\"highly commended\\" in the photojournalism category. The photo features the skins of rattlesnakes surrounded by the bloody handprints of people who had skinned a snake at a rattlesnake round-up in Sweetwater, Texas. =We Animals= McArthur conceived of the We Animals project in around 1998 after an encounter with a macaque monkey chained to a windowsill in Ecuador. She photographed the monkey as she was appalled at the treatment, and \\"knew that the way [she] saw our treatment of animals was important, and [she] wanted to share that point of view\\". On its website, We Animals is described as: > an ambitious project which documents, through photography, animals in the > human environment. Humans are as much animal as the sentient beings we use > for food, clothing, research, experimentation, work, entertainment, slavery > and companionship. With this as its premise, We Animals aims to break down > the barriers that humans have built which allow us to treat non-human > animals as objects and not as beings with moral significance. The objective > is to photograph our interactions with animals in such a way that the viewer > finds new significance in these ordinary, often unnoticed situations of use, > abuse and sharing of spaces. In December 2013, We Animals, a photobook by McArthur containing both text and over 100 of her photographs, was published by Lantern Books. The activist Bruce Friedrich, in a review published by The Huffington Post, described it as \\"the most gorgeous book [he had] experienced in many years\\", one which \\"offers haunting sadness, [but also] intense hope\\". In The Guardian in 2020, Ziya Tong selected the book as one of the best to widen readers' world views, writing that \\"McArthur brings an empathetic lens to the grim reality ‚Äì mostly unchallenged ‚Äì of millions of lives spent in captivity\\". McArthur has spoken in educational institutions since 2008. In 2014, a grant was awarded to McArthur to develop the We Animals Humane Education project by The Pollination Project and the Thinking Vegan. Through the We Animals Humane Education Program, McArthur offers a variety of presentations in school, university and other environments. The program seeks to \\"foster awe, curiosity and critical thinking about our relationships with animals\\", to \\"instill reverence, respect and responsibility\\", inspire empathy with animals, to \\"create gentler stewards of the earth\\", and to encourage people to be \\"agents of positive change\\". In 2017, McArthur launched the We Animals Archive, an archive of thousands of photographs and videos of animals in human-dominated environments. The Archive serves as a repository of media from the wider We Animals project that can be freely used by individuals and organizations working towards animal-protection goals. In 2019, We Animals Media ‚Äì a media agency focused on stories of animal exploitation ‚Äì was launched. McArthur is the founder and director, while other contributors include the journalist Corinne Benedict, the writer Kate Fowler, the photojournalist and filmmaker Aaron Gekoski, the filmmaker Alex Lockwood, the writer Anna Mackiewicz, the journalist Jessica Scott-Reid, the photographer and filmmaker Chris Showbridge, and the writer Sayara Thurston. Projects of We Animals Media include the We Animals Media Photography Masterclass with McArthur. =Captive= McArthur published a second book through Lantern, entitled Captive, in 2017. The book‚Äîwhich features contributions from the activist Virginia McKenna, the philosopher Lori Gruen, and Ron Kagan, of Detroit Zoo‚Äîfocuses on the animals in zoos and aquaria. It also contains a series of short essays by McArthur. Stephen F. Eisenman reviewed the book for Animal Liberation Currents, comparing McArthur's photography with that of other zoo photographers and photographers of human prisons. He said that > McArthur's Captive is a powerful, visual survey of zoo animals and their > physical conditions of captivity. But precisely because it examines so many > different zoos and animals, its cannot provide significant insight either > into the subjectivity of captive animals, or the ideological and economic > function of zoological gardens. The merging of close and sustained > photographic observation and detailed institutional history and critique is > what is most lacking in the current generation of zoo books. That‚Äôs a > worthwhile project for McArthur and her peers in the future. Photographs from the book appeared in the We Animals Archive in a section called A Year in Captivity. They were also exhibited at Toronto's Harbourfront Centre in September 2017. =HIDDEN= McArthur's third book, HIDDEN: Animals in the Anthropocene, is about \\"our conflict with non-human animals around the globe, as depicted through the lenses of thirty award-winning photojournalists\\", with a foreword written by Joaquin Phoenix. It will be released in 2020. =Unbound Project= With Keri Cronin, an associate professor of art history at the Department of Visual Arts at Brock University, McArthur founded the Unbound Project, a multimedia and book project aiming \\"to recognize and celebrate women at the forefront of animal advocacy, in both a contemporary and historical context\\", and to \\"inspire our audience to do what they can to make the world a kinder, gentler place for all species\\". Contemporary women profiled include Anita Krajnc, Carol J. Adams, Hilda Kean, Wendy Valentine, Leah Garc√©s, Seba Johnson, Lek Chailert, Gladys Kalema- Zikusoka, Marianne Thieme, and Elisa Aaltola. Historical women profiled include Lizzy Lind af Hageby, Ruth Harrison, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Dorothy Brooke, Caroline Earle White, Louisa May Alcott, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, and Fanny Martin. =The Ghosts in Our Machine= McArthur was the \\"main human subject\\" of the 2013 documentary film The Ghosts in Our Machine, directed by Liz Marshall. The film avoids the shocking imagery of many documentaries focussed on animal rights, such as Earthlings, meaning that it \\"takes an almost arthouse approach, resulting in a film that's more a meditation on suffering and the relationship between humans and other species, than an angry, didactic diatribe\\". Writing in Variety, the critic Peter Debruge said that > It's enough to make you sad, not for the animals (to whom human cruelty is > nothing new), but for McArthur, this beautiful young woman who feels so > deeply for those not of her kind that she carries their collective suffering > around with her daily. What must it be like to experience PTSD after > visiting dairy farms and facilities that supply primates for medical > testing?

It has been a useful tool in determining the properties of spaces. The mathematical notion of space includes every shape that exists in our 3-dimensional world such as curves, surfaces, and solid figures. Since spaces are often presented by formulas, it is usually not possible to visually determine their geometric properties. Some of these properties are connectedness (is the space in one or several pieces), the number of holes the space has, the knottedness of the space, and so on. Spaces are then studied by assigning algebraic constructions to them. This is similar to what is done in high school analytic geometry whereby to certain curves in the plane (geometric objects) are assigned equations (algebraic constructions). The most common algebraic constructions are groups. These are sets such that any two members of the set can be combined to yield a third member of the set (subject to certain restrictions). In homotopy theory, one assigns a group to each space X and positive integer p called the pth homotopy group of X. These groups have been studied extensively and give information about the properties of the space X. There are then operations among these groups (the Whitehead product) which provide additional information about the spaces. This has been very important in the study of homotopy groups. Several generalisations of the Whitehead product appear in and elsewhere, but the most far-reaching one deals with homotopy sets, that is, homotopy classes of maps from one space to another. The generalised Whitehead product assigns to an element Œ± in the homotopy set [Œ£A, X] and an element Œ≤ in the homotopy set [Œ£B, X], an element [Œ±, Œ≤] in the homotopy set [Œ£(A ‚àß B), X], where A, B, and X are spaces, Œ£ is the suspension (topology), and ‚àß is the smash product. This was introduced by and and later studied in detail by , (see also , p. 157). It is a generalization of the Whitehead product and provides a useful technique in the investigation of homotopy sets. The relevant MSC code is: 55Q15, Whitehead products and generalizations. Definition Let \\\\alpha \\\\in [\\\\Sigma A, X] and \\\\beta \\\\in [\\\\Sigma B, X] and consider elements \\\\alpha(\\\\Sigma \\\\pi_A) and \\\\beta(\\\\Sigma \\\\pi_B) \\\\in [\\\\Sigma(A \\\\times B), X], where \\\\pi_A and \\\\pi_B are the homotopy classes of the projection maps. The commutator :c(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)=(\\\\alpha(\\\\Sigma \\\\pi_A), \\\\beta(\\\\Sigma \\\\pi_B))) in the group [\\\\Sigma(A \\\\times B), X] is trivial when restricted to [\\\\Sigma(A \\\\vee B), X], where \\\\vee denotes wedge sum. The generalised Whitehead product is then defined as the unique element :[\\\\alpha, \\\\beta] \\\\in [\\\\Sigma(A \\\\wedge B), X] such that [\\\\alpha, \\\\beta](\\\\Sigma q) = c(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta), where q \\\\colon A \\\\times B \\\\to A \\\\wedge B is the quotient map. Properties Naturality: f‚àó[Œ±, Œ≤] = [f‚àó(Œ±), f‚àó(Œ≤)], if f : X ‚Üí Y is a map. All [Œ±, Œ≤] = 0, if X is an H-space. E[Œ±, Œ≤] = 0, where E : [Œ£(A ‚àß B), X] ‚Üí [Œ£2 (A ‚àß B), Œ£X] is the suspension homomorphism. Bi-additivity, if A and B are suspensions. A form of anti-commutativity. An appropriate Jacobi identity for Œ± and Œ≤ as above and Œ≥ ‚àà [Œ£C, X], if A, B, and C are suspensions. See for full statements of these results and proofs. Applications The product Œ£A √ó Œ£B has the homotopy type of the mapping cone of [ŒπŒ£A, ŒπŒ£B] ‚àà [Œ£(A ‚àß B), Œ£A ‚à® Œ£B] (). Whitehead products for homotopy groups with coefficients are obtained by taking A and B to be Moore spaces (, pp. 110-114) There is a weak homotopy equivalence between a wedge of suspensions of finitely many spaces and an infinite product of suspensions of various smash products of the spaces according to the Milnor-Hilton theorem. The map is defined by generalised Whitehead products . Related results If Y is a group-like H-space, then a product [A, Y] √ó [B, Y] ‚Üí [A ‚àß B, Y] is defined in analogy with the generalised Whitehead product. This is the generalized Samelson product denoted <œÉ, œÑ> for œÉ ‚àà [A, Y] and œÑ ‚àà [B, Y] . If ŒªU,V : [U, Œ©V] ‚Üí [Œ£U, V] is the adjoint isomorphism, where Œ© is the loop space functor, then ŒªA‚àßB,X<œÉ, œÑ>= [ŒªA,X (œÉ), ŒªB,X (œÑ)] for Y = Œ©X. An Eckmann‚ÄìHilton dual of the generalised Whitehead product can be defined as follows. Let A‚ô≠B be the homotopy fiber of the inclusion j : A ‚à® B ‚Üí A √ó B, that is, the space of paths in A √ó B which begin in A ‚à® B and end at the base point and let Œ≥ ‚àà [X, Œ©A] and Œ¥ ‚àà [X, Œ©B]. For (Œ©ŒπA)Œ≥ and (Œ©ŒπB)Œ¥ in [X, Œ©(A ‚à® B)], let d(Œ≥, Œ¥) ‚àà [X, Œ©(A ‚à® B)] be their commutator. Since (Œ©j) d(Œ≥, Œ¥) is trivial, there is a unique element {Œ≥, Œ¥} ‚àà [X, Œ©(A‚ô≠B)] such that (Œ©p){Œ≥, Œ¥} = d(Œ≥, Œ¥), where p : A‚ô≠B ‚Üí A ‚à® B projects a path onto its initial point. For an application of this, let K(œÄ, n) denote an Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space and identify [X, K(œÄ, n)] with the cohomology group Hn(X; œÄ). If A = K(G, p) and B = K(G‚Ä≤, q), then there is a map Œ∏ : A‚ô≠B ‚Üí K(G ‚äó G', p+q+1) such that (Œ©Œ∏){Œ≥, Œ¥} = Œ≥ ‚à™ Œ¥, the cup product in Hp+q(X; G ‚äó G‚Ä≤).

It is known for having been contaminated with radioactive wastes. Location The creek begins in a small spring-fed lake south of Lambert International Airport, then flows 19 miles north and east through the towns of Florissant, Hazelwood, Black Jack, Spanish Lake, St. Ann, and Berkeley. According to St. Louis Magazine, \\"It runs past schools, golf courses, and soccer fields.\\" The creek terminates in the Missouri River between the Lewis Bridge and the Columbia Bottom Conservation Area. History The name \\"Cold Water Creek\\" is a translation of the original French name Rivi√®re de L'eau Froide. The Spaniards called it Rio Fernando, Spanish for \\"Ferdinand River.\\" The French also called it Riviere aux Biches, French for \\"River of Roebucks.\\" In December 1989 the U.S. Department of Energy discovered radioactive material \\"in and along\\" the creek. That discovery halted a flood-control project planned between the United States Army Corps of Engineers and local suburban communities for the previous eleven years. The material was traced to two nearby dump sites, both from a common source: the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. In 1942 Mallinckrodt had reached an exclusive agreement with the U.S. government's Manhattan Engineering District to produce weapons-grade uranium at its factory north of downtown. From 1947 the company and the AEC condemned a 21.7-acre property near Lambert Field for the purpose of accumulating dangerous wastes from the downtown plant and other locations. That site became the St. Louis Airport Storage Site (SLAPSS). In 1966 a contractor relocated much of the material to another nearby location on Latty Avenue. Material from both the original SLAPPS site and from the Latty site eventually made its way into the creek bed. In 1989 the creek was finalized on the National Priorities List of the Superfund program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Between 2008 and 2011, local residents noticed what seemed an unusual concentration of cancers, other illnesses, and birth defects among their age cohort. Many were graduates of McCluer North High School and organized around its class reunions. In August 2015, the United States Army Corps of Engineers admitted that they found thorium-230 in the creek. In January 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the high rate of cancers in the area, and confirmed a potential link between the cluster and the polluted creek.

Marcel (Al√©ria) The Diocese of Aleria (Latin Dioecesis Aleriensis) was a Roman Catholic diocese of the Latin rite, in the center of the eastern coast of the island of Corsica in the Department of Haute-Corse. The town of Aleria was subject to repeated raids by Arab fleets in the eighth and ninth centuries, and eventually abandoned, many of its people fleeing to the mainland. The bishop moved to a secure stronghold to the north. From at least the eleventh century, the diocese was a suffragan of the metropolitan archdiocese of Pisa. The diocese was suppressed by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790, and was not revived after the Concordat of 1801 between the French Consulate and the Papacy.\\"Titular Episcopal See of Al√©ria\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 It has been a titular diocese since 2002. History There is evidence that Corsica was being converted to Christianity in the late 6th century. Pope Gregory I wrote in 597 to Bishop Peter of Aleria to recover lapsed converts and to convert more pagans from the worship of trees and sacred stones (menhir). He sent him money for baptismal robes. In 601, however, Aleria was without a bishop. Gregory had sent a certain Bishop Leo as Apostolic Visitor to deal with the situation in Corsica, where there had been no bishop for some time. Pope Gregory addresses Leo as episcopus in Corsica, bishop in Corsica, not bishop of Corsica, and authorizes him to perform ordinations of priests and deacons.Gregory I, Epistolarum Liber I, no. 78 (sometimes numbered 76), in: J. P. Migne (ed.), Patrologiae Latinae Tomus LXXVII (Paris 1862), pp. 532-533. While Leo was still in Corsica, Pope Gregory sent a second bishop, Martinus to join in the Visitation.Gregory (Epistles I, no. 80; Migne, p. 533) writes to the clergy and nobility of Corsica: Gregorius clero et nobilibus Corsicae a paribus. Etsi vos multo iam tempore sine pontifice esse Dei ecclesiae non doletis, nos tamen de eius regimine cogitare et suscepti cura compellit officii.... He announces that he is sending a second bishop to work with Bishop Leo, Martinum fratrem et coepiscopum nostrum ibidem cardinalem constituere sacerdotem, Leoni vero fratri et coepiscopo nostro operam eius visitationis iniungere. The special authority of the Pope was necessary since both bishops were working in dioceses which were not their own. With the Arab invasions, the town of Aleria was destroyed and abandoned. The bishop and cathedral retreated to the hillside town of Cervione, above the beach of Campoloro, some 25 km north of Aleria. In 846, Adelbert the tutor Corsicanae insulae informed Pope Sergius II that a force of 11,000 Saracens, with 73 ships and 500 cavalry, had come.Kehr, p. 467, no. 13.

Duchesne, II, p. 126). By the time of Pope Alexander II (1061‚Äì1073) there were several bishops functioning in Corsica again.Kehr, p. 469, no. 18. In 1077 Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085) entrusted the dioceses of the island to the Bishop of Pisa as his Vicar.Kehr, p. 469, no. 19-20. The Pope expresses happiness that the people of Corsica, after having for such a long time been subjected to the justice of the invaders, wish to return to the justice of the Holy Roman Church.Kehr, p. 469, no. 21. In 1713 there were some 200 people living in Aleria, under the government of the Genoese, though ecclesiastically they belonged to the Metropolitan of Pisa. There were 18 towns and villages in the diocese.Ritzler, V, p. 76, note 1. In 1770, at the beginning of the French domination of Corsica, the bishop no longer lived in Al√©ria, but in Cervione. The Cathedral Chapter had one dignity and twelve Canons. The diocese had 160 parishes.Ritzler, VI, p. 74, note 1. On 29 November 1801, in accordance with the Napoleontic Concordat of 1801, it was suppressed as the territory of the diocese of Ajaccio was extended to the whole of Corsica.

Gauthier was a reporter in China for L'Obs. In December 2015, her visa was not renewed and she was forced to leave the country after she published an article about Uyghurs in Xinjiang which Chinese government officials disapproved of. A Chinese government Foreign Ministry spokesman suggested Gauthier's article \\"openly supports terrorist activity, the killing of innocents and has outraged the Chinese public.\\"  Personal  Ursula Gauthier is a long time journalist that was working as a foreign correspondent for the French news organization L'Obs in China before she was expelled from the country in December 2015 for an article she wrote about the treatment of Uighurs in China. She was writing on Chinese police killing several Uighur people in Xinjiang which she claimed included women and children, all of whom they said were linked to an attack on a coal mine that happened in September. The controversy arose when Gauthier claimed that \\"abuse, injustice, expropriation\\" of Uighurs \\"probably\\" triggered retribution in the form of the mass slaughter at the coal mine. Gauthier claimed that many experts doubt that ETIM, the jihadist Uighur East Turkestan Islamic Movement accused by the Chinese government to be the organizer of all violent attacks in Xinjiang, poses any real threat inside China and that some experts deny ETIM's existence. She claimed that ETIM is not classified anymore as terrorist by the USA.  Career  Gauthier had spent six years reporting for L'Obs from Beijing before she was forced to leave. = Expulsion from China = Gauthier wrote an article about the Chinese leaders' reaction to the November 2015 Paris attacks that was released on November 18, 2015 titled \\"After the attacks, the solidarity of China is not without ulterior motives.\\" She was accused of supporting terrorism by Chinese officials and Chinese state-owned media, such as the Global Times, after her article was seen as being critical of the ruling class and their handling of Xinjiang Muslims. In particular, the Global Times took issue with Gauthier's statement in her article that \\"the Baicheng attack [in China] had nothing in common with the 13th November attacks [in Paris]\\" (l'attaque de Baicheng ne ressemble en rien aux attentats du 13 novembre), arguing that this statement suggested a view that the Chinese civilians perished in the Baicheng attack somehow deserve their fate. Gauthier was also accused by Chinese netizens on Zhihu of being offensive. Specifically, these netizens believe that Gauthier's way of expressing her criticism of the Chinese government, one that centers on questioning the sincerity of Chinese leaders' sympathy with victims in Paris, is at the very least \\"rude and disrespectful.\\" After these accusations, the press credentials of Gauthier were effectively revoked, and as a result of this so was her visa, and she was given the choice to either leave China before January 1, 2016, or apologize to the people of China. She ended up leaving China before the start of the new year.  Impact  Gauthier is the first foreign journalist since Melissa Chan of Al Jazeera in 2012 to be expelled from China. According to Gauthier, her being expelled from China was a scare tactic by the Chinese government to dissuade foreign journalists from criticizing Chinese policies, especially those involving Xinjiang, from within China. China's decision to expel Ursula Gauthier comes as little surprise to some considering the country's ranking on the Press Freedom Index.  Reactions  News organizations from all over the world have reported Gauthier's expulsion from China from the New York Times to Al Jazeera in Qatar. French journalists and press executives published a collective open letter condemning her expulsion. Most reactions from journalists and news organizations alike were not in favor of the Chinese government's decision to expel Ursula Gauthier. Although the Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Chinese government, applauded the decision, and published an article citing a survey they conducted that showed 95% of the people surveyed in China supported the government's decision. The Committee to Protect Journalists released the results from the Foreign Correspondents Club of China's annual survey results. The survey assessed the amount of trouble (such as how easy it is to gain access to certain areas, or how quickly a journalist receives her or his Chinese visa) that foreign journalist face while trying to report on stories going on in China. The survey concluded that the treatment of Ursula Gauthier by the Chinese government, and the Chinese press, which resulted in death threats and personal attacks, were comparable to abuse.

The United States had decided to covertly support the Kingdom of Laos in the Laotian Civil War as the Lao fended off a North Vietnamese invasion. The nascent RLAF was seen as a force multiplier but needed pilots and technicians. The 40-man Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing, code named Waterpump, was forwarded to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base for this training duty in March 1964. They would remain on duty through the truce of 21 February 1973. Their first hasty assignment was transition training to the T-28 Trojan for American civilian pilots; the resulting A Team would exist through 1967. The Air Commandos also conducted final training for Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) mercenary pilots; the resultant B Team would serve until 1970. Besides putting a polish on graduate pilots, the Waterpump detachment trained Lao pilots from scratch. The RLAF's high pilot casualty rate made bringing the RLAF rosters up to strength a long grind. Waterpump grew beyond its original training mission. From 19‚Äì29 July 1964, some Air Commandos were smuggled into Laos as an improvised Tactical Air Control Party for Operation Triangle. The success of the endeavor led to a forward air control system being set up for the war's duration. Some Waterpump personnel were later infiltrated into Laos to help staff regional Air Operation Centers. With Waterpump help, by war's end the RLAF had grown from 20 to 75 T-28 strike aircraft; it also operated ten AC-47 gunships and 71 support aircraft. Background As the United States government began supporting the French effort in the First Indochina War, it needed a secretive organization to support the Royal Lao Government (RLG) and its armed forces in its fight against North Vietnamese invaders. The purportedly civilian Programs Evaluation Office (PEO) sprang into being in December 1955 to offset a communist insurgency. It would be superseded by the Requirements Office (RO) during President John F. Kennedy's term of office. Thus, when the decision was made to train up and improve the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) to help prosecute the Laotian Civil War, the precedent had been set for covert support of the mission.Castle, pp. 9‚Äì12, 16‚Äì17, 52‚Äì53. Activities On 6 December 1963, Commander in Chief Pacific recommended that counterinsurgency experts from the Special Air Warfare Center at Eglin Air Force Base be detailed to aid the Royal Lao Air Force.Castle, p. 66. On 5 March 1964, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara approved deployment of Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando Wing on six month temporary duty to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. It was an all- volunteer unit; most of the men already had similar experience serving in Vietnam with Operation Farmgate. Codenamed variously Project or Operation Waterpump, or simply Waterpump, Detachment 6 was attached to 2nd Air Division in Saigon. It carried out training specified by Deputy Chief, Joint United States Military Advisory Group, Thailand (DEPCHIEFJUSTMAGTHAI). However, because the Ambassador controlled all U.S. military activities in Laos, reality said the Air Commandos answered to him.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 96‚Äì97. Major Drexel B. \\"Barney\\" Cochran headed a 40-man detachment; it was equipped with four AT-28D Trojans for training purposes. It was decided that the T-28s would be unmarked unless it was necessary to use either Lao or Thai insignia. The detachment was assigned primarily to train pilots for the Royal Lao Air Force. Although the RLAF had 20 T-28s, 13 Douglas C-47s, and eight light aircraft, it had only 23 pilots of disparate but low skill levels. In a desperate quest to fill seats in T-28 cockpits, the Air Commandos immediately began to train civilian pilots from Air America and Thai mercenaries. The civilian pilots would become known as the A Team of the RLAF. The Thai pilots were dubbed the B Team, and would fly under call sign Firefly; they signed on to fly 100 combat missions in six months.Haas, pp. 180 ‚Äì 189.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 108, 118.Warner, p. 135. Ambassador Leonard Unger approved his Programs Evaluation Office turning over bombs to the RLAF on 17 May. He also requested additional T-28s for the RLAF. Major Cochran forwarded the four Waterpump T-28s to Vientiane on the 18th; Thao Ma and his wingmen flew 12 combat sorties that afternoon. That same day, Unger urged his superiors in Washington, DC to approve use of American pilots in T-28s. Three days later, ten replacement T-28s arrived at Waterpump, forwarded from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force as excess to their needs. Approval also came through from Washington allowing use of American pilots.Conboy, Morrison, p. 109. As some Air America pilots were ex-military fighter pilots, they were already highly experienced. On 25 May 1964, after a week's familiarization training with the T-28, five Air America pilots flew their first combat mission, but to little effect except bullet holes in two of the planes. Ambassador Unger witnessed the battle damage and decided use of American pilots had to be restricted to emergency situations. Thereafter, use of the A Team was always highly selective because of the potential international media sensation if an American fell into communist hands. However, in the absence of any other combat search and rescue capabilities, the A Team covered pilot retrieval efforts in Laos.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 109‚Äì111, 113 The Thai B Team offered certain advantages; the Thai and Lao languages being mutually understandable helped considerably. Then too, the Thais being paid directly by Americans made them amenable to command. In the first year of Waterpump, 23 B Team pilots served in the RLAF. Amidst all this, Water Pump also began to train Lao pilots.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 100‚Äì101. Some Air Commandos now began to infiltrate Laos. In May 1964, two formed a skeletal Air Operations Center at Wattay outside Vientiane. The Air Commandos also pushed the envelope to sneakily fly some combat missions from time to time. Moreover, when U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Klusman was shot down on an armed reconnaissance mission on 6 June 1964, B and A Team pilots successively flew cover for the combat search and rescue effort. Also in June, a Waterpump officer and two enlisted specialists were covertly sent to Luang Prabang to support B Team efforts there.Conboy, Morrison, p. 137 notes 25, 26. The following month, Cochran, his unit's intelligence officer, and several other Air Commandos were covertly smuggled into Laos to participate in Operation Triangle. They served as an impromptu Tactical Air Control Party, coordinating complex air operations among Triangle's three columns and serving as forward air controllers. The operation was successful.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 112, 114 note 33. Despite the distraction of Operation Triangle, Waterpump managed to bring the RLAF T-28 force to 15 fully trained pilots, with five more in process.Anthony, Sexton, p. 129. T-28D strike from Long Tieng. As the Waterpump mission continued, it was attached to the 606th Air Commando Squadron in 1966. General Vang Pao agitated for his own Hmong pilots to support his Clandestine Army. He pointed out that the other four military regions of Laos had an RLAF squadron; that they did not share their air assets with him, and that he had need of the same.Anthony, Sexton, p. 259. CIA case agent James William Lair began a pilot training program for him in Thailand, using scrounged light aircraft and instructor pilots scrounged from the Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit, Continental Air Services, Inc, and the Royal Thai Air Force. By Summer 1967, the improvised program had graduated dozens of neophyte pilots in its three classes. Two of them were the first of 19 Hmong pilots accepted for Waterpump training. The Hmong were unlikely pilot candidates. They were unfamiliar with modern machinery, possessed little English, and were of small stature. However, wood blocks wired to the rudder pedals brought that control within reach of the short-legged cadets. Seat cushions in the T-28s boosted the Hmong high enough they could see out of the cockpit to fly.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 170, 180 note 27.Warner, p. 166. Building the RLAF's pilot strength in the face of combat losses was a long process. The Hmong turned out to be highly courageous fighters who flew until they were killed in action; only three of them would survive the war. One of the fallen Hmong, Vang Pao's brother-in-law Lee Lue, became the most famed pilot of the RLAF. The ongoing deaths in action made it difficult to supply sufficient numbers of Lao pilots to the RLAF. The A Team would not be phased out until 1967; by that time the B Team was considered trustworthy enough to replace them. The 606th also expanded and became the 56th Air Commando Wing in 1967.Conboy, Morrison, p. 170. Waterpump gained a new responsibility in March 1968. A forward air control operation named Raven FACs was formed in Laos; incoming volunteers were briefed at Waterpump before entering Laos. Still another task was laid upon them on 17 July 1968. Ambassador William H. Sullivan decided to expand the Air Commando Air Operation Centers from four specialists to about 14. The expanded AOC would have an instructor pilot in command, additional Raven FACs as needed, a senior enlisted flight line chief, a medic, a radio operator, an aircraft ordnance specialist, an avionics specialist, a ground support equipment specialist, and two engine mechanics. The latter were assigned to six month TDYs from Waterpump. The AOC expansion was codified as Palace Dog; many experienced Waterpump veterans would return for repeat tours under this program.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 261, 272‚Äì273. On 18 March 1969, Waterpump began a new mission supervising a Mobile Training Team instructing air crew members for AC-47 gunships.Anthony, Sexton, p. 275. In June 1969, a second class of Hmong pilots finished training and joined Vang Pao and the single surviving pilot from the first class. On 11 July 1969 that pilot, Lee Lue, was killed in action.Conboy, Morrison, p. 214. Nor was his death in action unusual; after five years, Waterpump was barely able to replace RLAF pilots as they were killed.Conboy, Morrison, p. 365. In 1970, the B Team would finally depart as the RLAF reached its full strength. The 11th group of Thai pilots graduated from Waterpump on 17 April, but were returned to the Royal Thai Air Force, thus leaving the tenth group to end the Firefly program.Conboy, Morrison, p. 264. In November 1971, to counteract a cutback in Raven FACs in Laos from 25 to eight by November 1972, Waterpump began training Lao forward air controllers. With most candidates having already flown over 3,000 combat missions, flying or combat experience was not an issue. The first class of Nok Ka Tien FACS graduated in January 1972 and began directing RLAF air strikes. By September 1972, four Lao FACs had progressed to directing air strikes for the USAF.Anthony, Sexton, p. 349. End On 21 February 1973, the ceasefire mandated by the Vientiane Treaty came into effect. U.S. bombing halted on the 22nd. By this time, Waterpump had grown to a strength of 316 assigned personnel. All the disparate U.S. covert organizations in Laos faced downsizing as they were incorporated into a Defense Attach√©'s office. In Waterpump's case, Americans were withdrawn from the AOCs in the Military Regions as part of the downsizing. T-28 missions almost ceased, then resumed limpingly. On 5 April 1974, the new Provisional Government of National Union (PGNU) took charge of Laos. By that time, Waterpump had been subsumed by the Defense Attach√©.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 363‚Äì365.Castle, p. 118. Results By the time Waterpump ceased operations, the Air Force it supported had grown to 75 T-28s, ten AC-47s, 21 C-47s, 26 H-34 helicopters, and 24 O-1 Bird Dogs. However, the RLAF suffered from its ongoing problems with training technicians, and was believed to be able to handle only 70% of maintenance on the aircraft. The Air Commandos would also run a local civic action program. Waterpump also succeeded in its civic action program. Beginning with informal medical missions to villages near the Udorn air base, the civic action program would spread throughout Thailand, and result in a hospital for RLAF personnel in Savannakhet, Laos. Aftermath The PGNU's attitude changed after the Fall of Saigon decided the adjacent Vietnam War. The PGNU began to confiscate American property; in turn, the American contingent was reduced to a Charg√© d'affaires and a staff of 20. Only a U.S. Army major remained to represent the U.S. military. In July 1976, he was expelled. On 14 March 1977, King Sisavang Vatthana was arrested, and the Lao People's Democratic Republic was proclaimed.Anthony, Sexton, p. 367.

AR theory is a method to help define the best reactor flowsheet using graphical techniques for a desired duty or objective function.  Origin of AR theory  The initial concept of an attainable region for chemical processes was proposed by Fritz Horn in 1964, where he believed in geometric methods to improve process design. These ideas were later refined and made specific to chemical reactors by co-developers David Glasser, Diane Hildebrandt, and Martin Feinberg. Overview  The AR is defined as the collection all possible outcomes for all conceivable reactor combinations. Geometrically, the AR may (for instance) be represented as a convex region in state space representing all possible outlet compositions for all reactor combinations. A combination of reactors is often termed a reactor structure. An example of the reactors that are considered for this theory are Continuous flow stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and a Plug flow reactor model (PFR). Knowledge of the AR helps to address two areas in chemical reactor design: # The reactor network synthesis problem: Given a system of reactions and feed point, construction of the AR assists with determining an optimal reactor structure that achieves a desired duty or objective function. That is, AR theory assists with understanding specifically what type and combination of the chemical reactors are best suited for a particular system and duty. # Performance targeting: Given an existing reactor design, knowledge of the AR assists with understanding if there are other reactor structures that could achieve superior performance, by comparison to its location in the AR. Seeing as the AR represents all reactor designs by definition, different proposed reactor designs must lie as a point in or on the AR in state space. The effectiveness of each design may then all be assessed by comparison the AR and their relation to objective functions if any.  Applications of theory  Examples of where AR theory can be applied, include: * The design of batch reactor networks; and * Comminution (Milling).

Flunder (born July 29, 1955) is an American singer and senior pastor of the City of Refuge United Church of Christ in Oakland, California and Presiding Bishop of The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries.  Life  Flunder was born in San Francisco, California and raised in the Church of God in Christ. In 1984 she began singing and recording with Walter Hawkins and the Love Center Choir, where she was the lead singer. She was later ordained by Hawkins. In 1986, Flunder was moved to begin working with and ministering to people with HIV/AIDS in response to the epidemic of the 1980s. She founded several not-for-profit enterprises in the San Francisco Bay Area, providing services for people affected by HIV: Hazard-Ashley House, Walker House and Restoration House, through the Ark of Refuge, Inc., which later became the Y. A. Flunder Foundation. In 1991, she founded the City of Refuge under the United Church of Christ, \\"in order to unite a gospel ministry with a social ministry\\".NCLI 2007 Program Book - United Church of Christ She describes the City of Refuge UCC as an effort to \\"create a spiritual community that will embrace our collective cultures, faith paths, gender expressions, and sexual/affectional orientations while simultaneously freeing us from oppressive theologies that subjugate women, denigrate the LGBT community, and disconnect us from justice issues locally and globally\\". The Transcendence Gospel Choir at the City of Refuge is the first all-transgender choir in the United States. Flunder earned a Certificate of Ministry Studies and a Master of Arts in 1997 from the Pacific School of Religion, before earning her Doctor of Ministry degree from the San Francisco Theological Seminary in 2001. In 2000 she founded the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, a trans- denominational coalition of Christian churches who \\"desire to celebrate and proclaim the radically inclusive love of Jesus Christ\\", and was appointed its Presiding Bishop in 2003. Flunder identifies as a womanist and a reconciling liberation theologian. In 2005 she authored a book, Where the Edge Gathers: Building a Community of Radical Inclusion. Carlton Pearson cites her among the first religious leaders to embrace and encourage him after he was declared a heretic due to coming out in support of universal reconciliation. In 2013 she was named as a Distinguished Alumna of the Pacific School of Religion. On December 1, 2014, Flunder was a keynote speaker in the White House for World AIDS Day, where she described the harmful effects of stigma and homophobia on those living with HIV and on AIDS education in general. The following year she was a guest speaker at the American Baptist College's Garnett-Nabrit Lecture Series. Since 2015 Flunder has been a member of the board of trustees of the Starr King School for the Ministry and also served as a member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. Flunder's spouse is Shirley Miller, the cousin of Walter Hawkins; they have been committed partners since the mid-1980s. Portrayals on film and television Flunder was portrayed by actress Phylicia Rashad for the final 3-part episode as part of the Dustin Lance Black mini-series When We Rise on March 3, 2017 on the major television network ABC. The Bishop's role in the show highlights the compassion of the church, the commitment of its leadership and the loving home the church provides to minister in the tough, primarily African-American community in San Francisco. Flunder was also depicted by Joni Bovill in the Joshua Marston drama film Come Sunday, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix in April 2018.

A single example was built in the late 1980s, but no production followed. Design and development The SA-32T was developed by Ed Swearingen from his Swearingen SX300 piston-engined homebuilt aircraft on behalf of the Jaffe Aircraft Corporation, who hoped to sell it as a relatively low-cost military trainer. The resulting design was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, with a mainly metal structure, but with composite engine cowlings and tips of wings and tails. Skin thicknesses were increased by 50% compared with the SX300 to make the airframe stronger. A laminar flow wing was used, which was claimed to give jet-like handling capabilities, while hardpoints could be fitted to allow weapons to be carried. The pilot and instructor sat side by side under a bubble canopy, with provision for ejector seats to be fitted. It had a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The prototype was powered by a single Allison 250-B17D turboprop engine driving a three-bladed propeller. A single prototype was built by Swearingen Aircraft Corporation, making its first flight on 31 May 1989, which was displayed at the Paris Air Show in June that year. The design was offered to the United States Air Force as a replacement for its aging Cessna T-37 Tweet trainers, and to West Germany and Turkey. In 1990, a version with tandem seating rather than the side-by-side seating of the prototype was proposed. Development of the SA-32T had been abandoned by 1992, although as of January 2016, the prototype is still registered as airworthy by the Federal Aviation Administration.

On 1 June 1940, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta the Viceroy and Governor-General of the (AOI, Italian East Africa), commander in chief of the Armed Forces Command of the Royal Italian Army () and General of the Air Force (), had about and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel) and by 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to General Archibald Wavell, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of Middle East Command, had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa. About were in Egypt and were training in Palestine. Hostilities began soon after the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940. On the Sudan‚ÄìEritrea and Sudan‚ÄìEthiopia borders, the Italian army captured Kassala, on 4 July, then Gallabat; Karora was occupied unopposed and Kurmuk taken on 7 July. The possibility of an Italian advance on Khartoum led the British to adopt a delaying strategy but apart from some local advances, the Italians fortified Kassala and Gallabat and made no offensive move. In August the Italians invaded British Somaliland and the British made a slow retreat to the coast then embarked for Aden, at some cost to the reputation of Wavell with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The British reversed their recognition of the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935‚Äì1936) in favour of Haile Selassie, the deposed emperor. Mission 101 and Gideon Force were based in Sudan to conduct sabotage and subversion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam. After an abortive counter-attack at Gallabat in November, the British conducted patrols and raids against the Italians with Gazelle Force in the Mareb River/Gash River delta north of Kassala and bluffed their opponents into believing that the British had much larger forces in eastern Sudan. The British blockade of the AOI made Aosta reluctant to deplete stocks of fuel, ammunition and spare parts after the invasion of British Somaliland was complete. With expectations that the Germans would defeat Britain before the end of 1940 and with the need to wait for the Italian invasion of Egypt (9‚Äì16 September 1940) to succeed before invading Sudan, the Italians in the AOI waited on events. British policy was to ensure the safety of shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and operations in East Africa were given second priority after Egypt. With reinforcements arriving from India and troops from Egypt due after Operation Compass, the British planned to invade Eritrea from Sudan on 9 February 1941. The British were forestalled by a sudden Italian retreat from Kassala on 18 January and Platt was ordered to mount a vigorous pursuit. The British invaded Eritrea and defeated the Italians at the Battle of Agordat (26‚Äì31 January 1941) which began the conquest of Eritrea; Selassie returned to Ethiopia on 20 January. Background  On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed Italian East Africa ( (AOI Italian East Africa), formed from the colonies of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia, which had been occupied after the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935‚Äì1936). Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, was appointed the Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI in November 1937, with headquarters in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel) in the AOI. (By 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to On 31 March 1940, Mussolini had laid down a defensive strategy against Kenya, a policy of limited offensives against Kassala and Gedaref (now Al Qadarif) in Sudan and a bigger offensive against French Somaliland to protect Eritrea. Naval forces based at Massawa were to take the offensive and the would provide air support for the ground and naval operations. On 10 June, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Egypt vulnerable to the forces in Italian Libya (, part of (ASI) and those in the AOI a menace to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence led to the closure of the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. =Mediterranean and Middle East= In mid-1939, General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, over the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres. Wavell had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa, of which about 9,000 were in Sudan, 8,500 in Kenya, 1,475 in British Somaliland and 2,500 in Aden. From 1938, Major-General William Platt had been the (the , Commandant) of the Sudan Defence Force with responsibility for the defence of Sudan, which had a frontier with Ethiopia. On 19 May 1940, the British discovered through signals intelligence that the Italian forces in the AOI had been ordered secretly to mobilise. Before the declaration of war, the British detected increases in the number of Italian troops on the Sudan border and assumed that if the Italians attacked Sudan, the objectives would be the capital Khartoum, to the west of the Eritrean frontier, Atbara, the junction of railways to Khartoum, from the border and Port Sudan, the only decent port and which had the only heavy engineering workshops in the country. The ground was arid and had no all- weather roads but in the dry weather before the monsoon in June or July, the ground was motorable nearly everywhere. Ultra The Italians in the AOI had replaced their ciphers by November 1940 but by the end of the month, the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the and replacement codes. Sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information from the daily report from the Viceroy to the operational plans of the and . On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that Prelude =Anglo-Egyptian Sudan= In 1940, the British had three infantry battalions in Sudan and the SDF, which had 4,500 men in 21 companies, the best-equipped being Motor Machine-Gun companies, with light machine-guns mounted in vans, lorries and a few locally made armoured cars; the Sudan Horse was converting to a 3.7-inch mountain howitzer battery. Platt held Khartoum with 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at Atbara and the 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment at Gebeit and Port Sudan. The SDF garrisoned the frontier with the provincial police and a motley group of irregular scouts, to watch, harass and delay the Italians. Should the Italians invade, the units would converge against the attackers, exploit distance, the inadequate roads, and supply difficulties, to impede their advance. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had three bomber squadrons, K Flight, 112 Squadron, with six Gladiator fighters at Port Sudan and 430 Flight, 47 Squadron for army co-operation. The aircraft were convenient for Port Sudan and the Red Sea but far from Kassala and Gedaref. In August, 203 Group RAF was formed at Khartoum, to guard the eastern end of the Takoradi air route from the Gold Coast (Ghana), with 1 (Fighter) Squadron, South African Air Force (SAAF), equipped with Gladiators. =Kassala= In 1940, Kassala was a provincial town of around 25,000 inhabitants, about from the frontier on the Mareb River/Gash River and the Sudan Railway which looped eastwards towards the border with Ethiopia. The river rose in Eritrea and flowed, full of silt, for about three months each year, which created extremely fertile land for cotton growing; the crop being exported from the railway station outside Kassala. The Italian ran from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea; after the Italians dammed the river at Tessenei to create a rival cotton growing industry and extended the road from Asmara to the Eritrea‚ÄìSudan border to transport the cotton crop, the road became an obvious route for an offensive in either direction. In July, the British found that Italian troops were assembling near Tessenei about inside the Eritrean border. The British planned to attack on 3 July but a wireless failure led to a postponement. At Kassala, the British had No. 5 Motor Machine-Gun Company, No. 6 Mounted Infantry Company of the Eastern Arab Corps, a mounted infantry company of the Western Arab Corps from Darfur away and the local police. (No. 3 Motor Machine-Gun Company from Butana arrived at noon on 4 July.) After hostilities began on 10 June, the flew reconnaissance sorties over Sudan and bombed Kassala, Port Sudan, Atbara, Kurmuk and Gedaref. Small arms were the only defence against air attack and civilian morale suffered but the bombing caused no military damage. The SDF patrolled frequently and raided across the Sudan‚ÄìEthiopia border around Kassala and Gallabat, causing some casualties and taking several prisoners. The Italian forces in the AOI remained passive in June but during July prepared to attack Karora, Kassala, Gallabat and Kurmuk. =Italian preparations= Before the Italian declaration of war, Mussolini intended a defensive strategy in the AOI, with tactical offensives to protect Eritrea by attacking French Somaliland (Djibouti) and conducting limited attacks on Sudan. The Italian army in the AOI had one metropolitan division, the equivalent of two more European divisions, all short of heavy weapons and transport and seven understrength colonial divisions. The army was organised in four commands, the Northern Sector in the vicinity of Asmara, Eritrea (Lieutenant-General Luigi Frusci, of the , Governor of the Eritrea Governorate and Amhara Governorate), the Southern Sector in the Galla-Sidamo Governorate (General Pietro Gazzera), the Eastern Sector on the border with French Somaliland and British Somaliland (General Guglielmo Nasi) and the Giuba Sector (Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone) covering southern Somalia near Kismayo, Italian Somaliland. The had 325 aircraft in the AOI, 142 of which were in reserve (not all operational) with little prospect of more supplies of fuel, ammunition and spare parts. A force was concentrated near the Sudan border for an attack on Kassala, comprising two colonial brigades, four squadrons of cavalry, approximately 24 light tanks, medium tanks and armoured cars and ten batteries of artillery. Operations =Capture of Kassala= Kassala in 1940 The attack on Kassala was led by Frusci and Major-General Vincenzo Tessitori with Italian and colonial forces comprising about in three columns, Gulsa east, Gulsa west, equipped with trucks and Central, with support from the and some cavalry squadrons acting as vanguards. At on 4 July 1940, the three columns, about apart, started their attack on Kassala. The cavalry, led by Lieutenant Francesco Santasilia, bypassed Mount Kasala and Mount Mocram and launched the first attack. Kassala was defended by fewer than of the SDF and local police, who remained under cover during a twelve-hour bombardment by the and then emerged to begin the defence of the town. The defenders knocked out six Italian tanks and inflicted considerable casualties on the attackers. At Italian cavalry entered Kassala and the defenders withdrew to Butana Bridge having lost one man killed, three wounded and 26 missing, some of whom rejoined their units. Italian casualties were 43 dead and 114 men wounded. Gazzera occupied the fort of Gallabat the same day and Kurmuk in Sudan. Gallabat was placed under the command of Colonel Castagnola and fortified. Italian artillery firing on Kassala. At Kassala, the 12th Colonial Brigade built anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strongpoints. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the Sudanese population. During the Italian attack at Kassala a battalion of Italian colonial troops and a banda (pl. irregulars) attacked Gallabat and forced No. 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps to retire. Karora was occupied unopposed when the Sudanese police were ordered to withdraw and at Kurmuk on 7 July, another colonial battalion and a supported by artillery and aircraft, overcame a force of 60 Sudanese police after a short engagement. The Italian attacks had gained a valuable entry point to Sudan at Kassala, made it more difficult for the British to support the indigenous resistance in Gojjam by capturing Gallabat and the loss of Kurmuk prompted some of the locals to resort to banditry. Local Sudanese opinion was impressed by the Italian successes but the population of Kassala continued to support the British and supplied valuable information during the occupation. The SDF continued to operate close to Kassala and on 5 July, a company of the 2nd Warwick arrived at Gedaref to act as a reserve for the SDF. The British discovered that rumours of the arrival of the Warwick had reached the Italians in greatly magnified form and Platt decided to bluff the Italians into believing that there were far greater forces on the Sudan border. An Italian map captured on 25 July showed around 20,000 British and Sudanese troops in Kassala province. The 5th Indian Infantry Division was ordered to Port Sudan on 2 August. Gazelle Force In September 1940, the 5th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Lewis Heath) began to arrive in Sudan; Platt held back the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier John Marriott) around Port Sudan and the rest, with attachments from the SDF, was ordered to prevent an Italian advance on Khartoum, from Goz Regeb on the Atbara River to Gallabat, a front of about . Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy), based on Skinner's Horse, No. 1 Motor Machine-Gun Group of the SDF and a varying amount of field and horse artillery, was assembled near Kassala to probe forwards, to harass the Italians and keep them off-balance to make an impression of a much larger force and encourage a defensive mentality. By using the term Five instead of 5th in all communications, the British managed to persuade Italian military intelligence that five Indian divisions occupied the 5th Indian Division area. In November, after the failed British attack at Gallabat, Gazelle Force operated from the Gash river delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, to the extent that Aosta ordered Frusci, the commander of the Northern Sector to challenge the British raiders. Two Italian battalions conducted desultory operations against Gazelle Force north of Kassala for about two weeks, then withdrew. In Rome, General Ugo Cavallero, the new Chief of the Defence Staff (, had urged the abandonment of plans to invade Sudan and to concentrate on the defence of the AOI. From early January, signs appeared that the Italians were reducing the number of troops on the Sudan frontier and a withdrawal from Kassala seemed possible. News of the Italian disaster in Operation Compass in Egypt, hit-and-run attacks by Gazelle Force and the activities of Mission 101 in Ethiopia, led Frusci to become apprehensive about the northern route to Kassala. On 31 December, the troops on the northern flank withdrew behind Sabdaret, with patrols forward at Serobatib and Adardet and a mobile column in Sabdaret for contingencies. Frusci was ordered to retire from Kassala and Metemma to the passes from Agordat to Gondar but objected on grounds of prestige and proclaimed that the imminent British attack would be scattered. On 17 January, the 12th Colonial Brigade withdrew from Kassala and Tessenei to the triangle formed by the northern and southern roads from Kassala at Keru, Giamal Biscia and Aicota. =British Somaliland, 1940= In 1940, British Somaliland was garrisoned by 631 members of the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) and a small party of police at Berbera armed only with small-arms and anti-tank rifles with 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but by mid-July, reinforcements of two infantry battalions had arrived. The British hoped that the effort of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that the French in Djibouti would be a more tempting target. The defeat in France in 1940 and the French armistices with Germany and Italy left the British in Somaliland isolated. On 3 August 1940, the Italians invaded with two colonial brigades, four cavalry squadrons, tanks and L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, batteries, pack artillery and air support. The SCC skirmished with the advancing Italians as the main British force slowly retired. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen took command as reinforcements increased the British garrison to five battalions with about 4,500 British and Commonwealth troops, 75 percent being African infantry and Somali irregulars. The main British defensive position was at the Tug Argan Gap, which commanded the road to Berbera and on 11 August, the Battle of Tug Argan began. By 14 August, the British were close to being cut off and with only one battalion left in reserve and next day, Godwin-Austen received permission to withdraw from the colony. By on 18 August, most of the British and local troops had been evacuated to Aden and the Italians entered Berbera on the evening of 19 August. The British had casualties and the Italians suffered and consumed irreplaceable resources. Churchill criticised Wavell for abandoning the colony but Wavell called Godwin-Austen's retirement a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. =Capture of Gallabat= Gallabat fort lay in Sudan about south of Kassala opposite Metemma over the Ethiopian border beyond the Boundary Khor, a dry river bed with steep banks covered by long grass. British orders forbade firing across the frontier if war was declared but the platoon in Gallabat heard over the wireless that it had begun and fired 13,000 rounds from a ridge overlooking Metemma. Both places were surrounded by field fortifications and Gallabat was held by a colonial infantry battalion. Metemma had two colonial battalions and a formation, under the command of Lieutenant- Colonel Castagnola. The 10th Indian Infantry Brigade, a field artillery regiment, B Squadron, 6th RTR with six Cruiser tanks and six Light Tank Mk VI, attacked Gallabat on 6 November at An RAF contingent of six Wellesley bombers and nine Gladiator fighters were thought sufficient to overcome the fighters and believed to be in range. The infantry assembled from Gallabat, whose garrison was unaware that an attack was coming, until the RAF bombed the fort and put the wireless out of action. The field artillery began a simultaneous bombardment, changed target after an hour and bombarded Metemma. The night previous, the 4th Battalion, 10th Baluch Regiment occupied a hill overlooking the fort as a flank guard. The troops on the hill covered the advance at of the 3rd Royal Garwhal Rifles followed by the tanks. The Indians reached Gallabat and fought hand-to-hand with \\"Granatieri di Savoia\\" Division and some Eritrean troops in the fort. At the 25th and 77th Colonial battalions counter- attacked and were repulsed but three British tanks were knocked out by mines and six by mechanical failures caused by the rocky ground. The defenders at Boundary Khor were dug in behind fields of barbed wire and Castagnola contacted Gondar for air support. Italian bombers and fighters attacked all day, shot down seven Gladiators for a loss of five Fiat CR-42s and destroyed the lorry carrying spare parts for the tanks. The ground was too hard and rocky to dig trenches and when Italian bombers made their biggest attack, the infantry had no cover. An ammunition lorry was set on fire by burning grass and the sound was taken to be an Italian counter-attack from behind; when a platoon advanced towards the sound with fixed bayonets, some troops thought that they were retreating. Part of the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at the fort broke and ran, carrying some of the Gahrwalis with them. Many of the British fugitives mounted their transport and drove off, spreading the panic and some of the runaways reached Doka before being stopped. (The battalion was eventually replaced by the 2nd Highland Light Infantry and fought in Syria and Iraq.) The Italian bombers returned next morning and that evening, Slim ordered a withdrawal from Gallabat Ridge westwards to less exposed ground. Sappers from the 21st Field Company remained behind to demolish the remaining buildings and stores in the fort. The artillery bombarded Gallabat and Metemma and set off Italian ammunition dumps. British casualties since 6 November were killed and The Italian 27th Colonial Battalion was thought to have been destroyed with 600 killed or wounded. The brigade patrolled to deny the fort to the Italians and on 9 November, two Baluch companies attacked, held the fort during the day and retired in the evening. During the night, an Italian counter-attack was repulsed by artillery-fire and next morning the British re- occupied the fort unopposed. Ambushes were laid and prevented Italian reinforcements from occupying the fort or the hills on the flanks, despite frequent bombing by the . The brigade re-occupied the ridge three days later but made no attack on Metemma. The caravan routes into Ethiopia needed to supply the (\\"Patriots\\", Ethiopian irregulars supported by the British) and by Gideon Force remained under Italian control. For two months, the 10th Indian Brigade and then the 9th Indian Brigade simulated a division, the slouch hats of The Garhwal Rifles being taken as a sign that an Australian division had arrived. The brigades blazed communication trails eastwards from Gedaref and created dummy airfields and stores depots, to convince Italian military intelligence that the British offensive from Sudan would be towards Gondar in the south and that the attack at Kassala into Eritrea was a bluff. Aftermath =Analysis= July was the height of the rainy season but they were unusually light and disrupted road travel far less than usual. The Italians made no attempt to exploit the victory at Kassala, apart from a short advance to Adardeb near the railway; Kurmuk was abandoned at the same time. The Italians might have believed that an advance would be too difficult or overestimated the size of the forces opposite them. The British to the north and west had time to plan their delaying campaign against an advance on Khartoum, Atbara or Port Sudan. When no attack came, parties from the Worcester and Essex reinforced the force outside Kassala which induced the Italians to retreat into the town and wait. The British issued an intelligence summary on 18 July, which described the huge advantage in numbers enjoyed by the Italians and the apparent absence of any intention decisively to use it. The attack on Kassala was called a raid and the other attacks a nuisance. The report concluded that the Italians were waiting on the conclusion of armistice talks with the Vichy regime in France before deciding on strategy. The British concluded that the small British and colonial contingents in East Africa had succeeded in defending the frontiers of the east African colonies, according to the strategy laid down by Wavell. The British evacuation of Somaliland was announced on 20 August and Home Intelligence Reports showed that after a period of public apathy there was increasing criticism and doubts about the official excuses being made and scepticism that the reverse did not matter. After the occupation of the Channel Islands and apprehension over the course of the Battle of Britain the news added to public disquiet. While British press reports that the Italian forces in the AOI were a \\"...beleaguered army which must live on its reserves....\\" were the same as the Italian appreciation of the situation, this was not publicly known. A member of the public remarked that Some senior British officials thought that defeat was inevitable and that it was a Pyrrhic victory for the Italians, who had used irreplaceable resources, increased the dispersion of the military forces in the AOI and lost the means to follow alternatives, which might have brought more success. The British had established the Italian order of battle and aspects of Italian strategic thinking but the Italians managed to keep their tactical moves secret. The Italian army changed its cyphers on the outbreak of war and the British took until November to break into the new cypher; a new cypher was introduced in November but this was quickly broken. During the signals intelligence blackout, the British lacked knowledge of the Italian order of battle, equipment and readiness; fears grew that the Italians were preparing to invade Sudan and Kenya. When the British counter-offensives began in January 1941, documents captured by the British and the isolation of the Italians in East Africa made it impossible for them to change their cyphers for transmissions to Italy, created perfect conditions for \\"the cryptographers' war\\". Despite of a lack of aircraft for reconnaissance and no network of spies in the AOI, the British in 1941 had a comprehensive view of the Italian supply situation and every Italian decision. Knowledge that the Italians were going to retire from Kassala, prompted the British to begin their invasion of the AOI on 19 January instead of 8 February, eavesdropping on Italian plans and assessments of the situation, often before the recipients had decoded the signals. While in London for discussions with Churchill, Wavell signalled to Cairo that the evacuation of British Somaliland had not been the cause of recriminations but after more details of the Battle of Tug Argan arrived in London, Churchill questioned why the British had retreated and if the Italian superiority was really overwhelming, why they had not exploited their advantage. Churchill complained that the defence of the Tug Argan Gap had been \\"precipitately discontinued\\" and that Godwin-Austen had exaggerated the number of British casualties. Churchill blamed the local commanders for failing adequately to conduct a fighting retreat. Wavell replied that high casualties were not a sign of good leadership; Churchill never forgave the slight and began to plan his dismissal. Aosta later wrote that the invasion plan depended on speed but supply difficulties, unexpectedly poor weather and rains blocked some roads, slowing the advance. During the delay caused by the British defence of Tug Argan, Aosta tried to send a force of 300 volunteers by aircraft to capture Berbera by coup de main but the scheme was cancelled, because the British remained in occupation of the only landing ground. The Italians had failed to exploit the opportunity and given the haphazard nature of the British evacuation and the lack of defences, the withdrawal might have prevented. Aosta drew up plans to exploit the victory in Somaliland, including a scheme to invade Kenya with two columns, to rendezvous at Fort hall north of Nairobi, ready to capture the capital. Under the text Aosta wrote, \\"Extreme caution must be observed\\". In Eritrea, Tessitore had proposed to invade Sudan soon after the declaration of war and capture Khartoum and Atbara. On orders from Rome, Aosta based his strategy on events further north in Libya and Egypt. After the Italian invasion of Egypt, Aosta considered that an offensive move was dependent on being able to link with the forces of Italian Libya, which became impossible after the British expelled the Italians from Egypt in Operation Compass (9 December 1940 ‚Äì 9 February 1941). Aosta liaised with Marshal Rodolfo Graziani in Libya but as Italian supplies of fuel in the AOI diminished, passive defence became the only realistic choice. In late 1940, Aosta was advised that the war in Europe would probably end in October and decided to wait on events. =Casualties= At Kassala, the British lost one man killed, three wounded and 26 missing, some of whom rejoined their units. the Italians suffered casualties of 43 dead and 114 men wounded. During the invasion of British Somaliland, the British suffered casualties of and mostly troops of the Northern Rhodesia Regiment and the Camel Corps machine-gunners, along with some equipment that could not be embarked during the evacuation. The Italians suffered and expended irreplaceable fuel and ammunition. In the fighting at Gallabat from 6 November, the British suffered casualties of killed and Italian losses were thought to be around 600 men. =Subsequent operations= After the British reverse at Gallabat in November, Wavell held a review of the situation in Cairo from 1 to 2 December. With Operation Compass imminent in Egypt, the British forces in east Africa were to provide help to the Patriots in Ethiopia and continue to pressure the Italians at Gallabat. Kassala was to be recaptured early in January 1941, to prevent an Italian invasion and the 4th Indian Division was to be transferred from Egypt to Sudan from the end of December. With the success of Compass, east Africa was made second priority after Egypt and it was intended to have defeated the Italian forces in Ethiopia by April. The Italian retirement from Kassala on 18 January 1941, suggested that the British victory in Egypt was affecting the situation in East Africa and that a bolder British strategy was justified. The British offensive from Sudan due on 9 February was brought forward to 19 January. Platt was ordered to mount a vigorous pursuit and fought the Battle of Agordat from 26 to 31 January 1941, leading to the capture of Agordat on 1 February and Barentu the next day. Haile Selassie the deposed Emperor of Ethiopia crossed into Ethiopia on 20 January and in February, the Frontier Battalion SDF, the 2nd Ethiopian Battalion and Nos 1 and 2 Operational Centres, were renamed Gideon Force. Lieutenant-Colonel Orde Wingate was ordered to capture Dangila and Bure, which had garrisons of a colonial brigade each and gain control of the road between Bure and Bahrdar Giorgis, to provide a base for Selassie. The were to attack the main roads from Gondar and Addis Ababa and keep as many Italian troops back defending Addis Ababa as possible.

The bowstring arch bridge, carrying Kirby Road, was completed in 1923. Closed to vehicular traffic since the late 1970s, it presently forms a part of the Humber Valley Heritage Trail. The bridge is currently in an advanced state of disrepair; a decision on its rehabilitation is pending. History The McEwen bridge was named after Lorne McEwen, who purchased the abutting land in 1916. The bridge, designed by Frank Barber, a notable Ontario engineer, was completed in 1923 to carry a single lane of vehicular traffic on Kirby Road over the Humber River. It is one of four reinforced concrete bowstring arch bridges over the Humber, all built to Barber's design. In the late 1970s, a section of Kirby Road east of Huntington Road was abandoned due to erosion that had been deemed too costly to repair, resulting in the bridge being closed to vehicular traffic. However, the bridge has remained open to pedestrians using the Humber Valley Heritage Trail. The bridge is presently within the Nashville Conservation Reserve of the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, forming a crucial link of its proposed system of hiking, cycling and equestrian trails. Current state Since opening, the McEwen Bridge has not been subjected to major rehabilitation or repair and is currently in an advanced state of disrepair. In 2010, the City of Vaughan initiated an environmental assessment study for the bridge's proposed rehabilitation. The bridge scored 45.1 on the Bridge Condition Index by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, which is considered poor condition. Its structural integrity has been compromised in many ways, including damage to the deck, bottom arch chord, vertical arch hangers, floor beams and guard rails, with large sections affected by spalling, all of which poses significant risk to users. The EA study recommends full rehabilitation of the bridge to preserve its heritage potential and to retain a river crossing for the trail users; however, work is yet to commence.

Biography  In 651, Rabi ibn Ziyad invaded the Sasanian province of Sakastan. After some time, he reached Zaliq, a border town between Kirman and Sakastan, where he forced the dehqan of the town to acknowledge Muslim authority. He then did the same at the fortress of Karkuya, which had a famous fire temple, which is mentioned in the Tarikh-i Sistan. He then continued to seize more land in the province. He thereafter besieged the capital Zrang, and after a heavy battle outside the city, its governor Aparviz surrendered. When Aparviz went to Rabi ibn Ziyad to discuss about the conditions of a treaty, he saw that he was using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who in order to spare the inhabitants of Sakastan from the Arabs, made peace with them in return for a heavy tribute of one million dirhams, as well as 1,000 slave boys (or girls) bearing 1,000 golden vessels. Rabi ibn Ziyad was then appointed as the governor of the province. 18 months later, Rabi was summoned to Basra, and was replaced by Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura as governor. In 671, Rabi was appointed as the governor of Khurasan, where he was able to expand Muslim rule in the east as far as Balkh. In 673, his son Abdallah ibn Rabi succeeded him as governor.

It fought in the Battle of Kiev. In the summer of 1942, the 2nd Airborne Corps became the 32nd Guards Rifle Division.  History  The 2nd Airborne Corps was formed in April 1941 from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Airborne Brigades based in the Kharkov Military District. By 1 June, the corps was fully manned, but due to the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa, the corps could not be fully equipped. Its first commander was Major General Fyodor Kharitonov. When the German invasion began, the corps was initially stationed in the rear area, but as the situation deteriorated it was sent to the front. The corps fought in the Battle of Kiev and suffered heavy losses. On 30 August, the corps was attached to the 40th Army. Its 2nd Airborne Brigade attacked a German battalion on the outskirts of Nehaivka, and in the pursuit reached Hill 130. The corps' 3rd Airborne Brigade captured Korelsky on the same day. In conjunction with a tank battalion, the 4th Airborne Brigade covered the approaches to Atyushov. On 3 September, the corps was positioned in the area of Putyvl and held the positions of Khiznyak, Hill 126.1, Zheldak, Gnilitsa, Huty and Novoselovka. The corps was fighting near Konotop on 10 September. Due to its losses, the corps was disbanded in September but quickly reformed under the command of Mikhail Tikhonov. On 14 May 1942, the corps was transferred to the Taman Peninsula to defend the coast. On 2 August, it was converted into the 32nd Guards Rifle Division.

This fish was first described in 1855 by the French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau, who studied the fauna of South America while crossing the continent from Rio de Janeiro to Lima in an expedition starting in 1843 and lasting five years. Description R. lapidifer can grow to a maximum length around . It resembles a marine snapper (genus Lutjanus) in body shape and has five distinctive dark vertical bars on each side. The lips are large and underslung. The main body colour is an iridescent silvery-violet with random gold speckling. Small blue markings are on the face, two diagonal blue lines pass across the eyes, and an intermittent black spot appears on the soft part of the dorsal fin. Fish in this genus are characterised by a pointed snout, eyes set far back on the head, a depressed body with a compressed ventral region, and the ventral scales being smaller than those on the flanks. Distribution and habitat The species is endemic to the southeastern Amazon basin in Brazil, where it is found in the Araguaia River and Tocantins River. It is typically found close to the bottom in rapids and fast-moving stretches of the river. Ecology R. lapidifer forages on the river bed in fast-moving stretches of water, feeding on small invertebrates. Its diet varies with the time of year and the level of the river. When water levels are high, the main prey is chironomid midge larvae, but at lower water levels, caddisfly and mayfly larvae predominate. The fish has a large mouth and is more efficient at winnowing through the soft sediment than related species with smaller gapes. The swim bladder is reduced in size in this fish and it spends much of its time hopping around and perching on the riverbed, propped up by its pelvic fins, in the manner of a goby. During feeding, it repeatedly dives head first into the sediment with its mouth open wide, and then expels sand through its gill chambers. In readiness for breeding, a pair of R. lapidifer forms a nest about across in a gravelly area of the river bed. Adult fish have been observed carrying small pebbles in their mouths to build the nest, hence the specific name lapidifer (bearer of stones). A clutch of about 200 eggs is laid and the nest is guarded by both parents. They also turn the eggs and move them about to ensure aeration, and the eggs hatch in five to six days.

The club was affiliated to Bristol City F.C. and played in the South West Combination, FA Women's Premier League Southern Division, and FA Women's Premier League National Division. History The first women's team to represent Bristol City were not actually part of the football club, but were actually an independent team, Bristol United, with no affiliation to Bristol City. In 1990 they were invited to represent City by wearing red kits and using the club's name. Four years later, City began work developing their own women's football section when fathers Roger Bowyer and Andy Baylis, began entering girls' teams in local 6-a-side leagues. From these beginnings a senior women's team grew, and worked their way up the leagues. They won the South-West Combination in the 2001‚Äì02 season, winning promotion to the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division. It took them just two seasons in the Southern Division to win promotion to the FA Women's Premier League National Division, finishing the 2003‚Äì04 season with a record of 18 wins, three draws and three defeats to top the Southern table. Promotion meant they would now play in the top flight of English women's football, where they would join local rivals Bristol Rovers in the National Division. City found life at the top of the women's game difficult, and their stay in the National Division lasted for just a single season. They ended the 2004‚Äì05 campaign with just 9 points and were relegated straight back down to the Southern Division. Two years later, in May 2007, Bristol City announced that they would no longer fund a women's team. The club moved to Bath and became part of the TeamBath group of sports teams. The name Bristol City returned to women's football in 2016, however. In a strange twist City took over, and renamed, FA WSL side Bristol Academy. Although they had been renamed in the meantime, Academy were the same team that had been City's fierce rivals of the late 90s and early 2000s: Bristol Rovers. It was announced in November 2015 that Academy would become Bristol City W.F.C.. References Category:Defunct women's football clubs in England Category:Bristol City F.C.

It is also known as Habana Wharf Road. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010.  History  Edward Maitland Long, sugar plantation owner in Habana The stone and gravel causeway near the end of Habana Wharf Road was built during 1882 with South Sea Islander (Melanesian) labour, to provide tramline access to a wharf on the bank of Constant Creek near to where it empties into the ocean about north-west of Mackay. The wharf was built in late 1882 or early 1883, to service the Habana sugar plantation, owned by Edward Maitland Long and William Robertson. The history of the Mackay district is closely linked to the sugar industry. The City of Mackay is named for John Mackay, who entered the valley of the Pioneer River in 1860 and established a pastoral run there the following year. In 1862 a settlement was begun on the south bank of the river and by 1863 Mackay had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a port of entry and a customs house was opened. The first sugar plantation was established near Mackay in 1865 and the first small sugar mill was opened in 1868. South Sea Islanders (referred to at the time as Kanakas) made a major contribution to Queensland's early sugar industry. Between 1863 and 1904, some fifty thousand Islanders were brought to Queensland as indentured labourers usually bound by a three year contract. The Islanders provided cheap manual labour, but were also believed to be essential in a climate that was considered too harsh for white manual labourers. Most came from eighty islands in Melanesia, mainly those included in present day Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The method of recruitment remains a matter of debate, but it seems that at least some of the recruiting during the initial phase was by kidnapping and deception. Islanders made a vital contribution to the sugar industry, performing virtually all of the field work connected with the industry during its first phase of development. Only a minority stayed on; most returned to their islands at the conclusion of their contract period. The Pioneer Valley, one of Australia's largest sugar producing areas has always had the largest South Sea Islander population in Queensland. They began arriving in the Mackay district from 1867, and by 1875 there were about 1700 in the area, comprising 45 percent of the total population. Over two thousand Islanders still reside in the Mackay region. Although an 1875 outbreak of the crop disease, rust, caused some foreclosures and sales, by 1876 the Mackay district had 18 sugar mills and of land were under sugar cultivation. The sugar industry boomed in the early 1880s and Mackay prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre, drawing business from nearby pastoral holdings and the sugar plantations being developed along the river. Habana Sugar Mill, 1895 The period 1881 to 1884 also marked the zenith of the plantation system of growing sugar cane. This system was characterised by large land holdings that were worked with indentured South Sea Islander labour. Each plantation built its own sugar mill to crush its cane. Twelve mills opened near Mackay during the early 1880s, including at Habana, on the plantation of Long and Robertson. The Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) opened a large mill at Homebush in 1883, and in the Mackay district of cane were being cultivated under the plantation system by 1884. However, this system depended on the importation of South Sea Islander labour, and it soon suffered a number of blows. A drop (of a third) in the price of sugar in 1884, and increasing numbers of small selectors and farmers in the area, began to challenge the plantation system. Small farmers did not like having to crush their sugar crops at plantation mills, where they were a secondary consideration. Sir Samuel Griffith, Queensland Premier between 1883-1888 and 1890-1893, sought to break the plantations into small farms. This accorded with the preferred model for the development of Queensland: small yeomen farmers working their own land with the help of their families. Legislation aimed at applying this model, together with humanitarian and union concerns, as well as racism, ultimately formed the basis for opposition to and brought about the eventual cessation of the trade in South Sea Islander labour. Church and mission groups opposed it on ethical and humanitarian grounds. And labour unions, exclusively white, felt threatened by cheap non-European labour and were concerned that employers would use Islanders to undermine working conditions. From 1884, Islander labour was progressively restricted. In 1884 an amendment to the Pacific Islanders Labourers Act 1880 banned South Sea Islanders from a range of work, and restricted them to menial jobs in agriculture. The Pacific Islanders Act of 1885 sought to end the recruitment of South Sea Island labour by 1890; this was repealed in 1892 on economic grounds. However the Pacific Island Labourers (Extension) Act 1892 further barred them from construction work on plantation roads and tramways. Finally after Federation in 1901, two pieces of Commonwealth legislation put an end to the trade: the Immigration Restriction Act (1901) and the Pacific Island Labourers Act (1901), the former being where the various policies that came to be termed the \\"White Australia Policy\\" began. It aimed to exclude all non-European immigrants; the latter legislation required an end to recruitment of South Sea Islanders from March 1904 and their deportation after December 1906. From 1904 to 1908, around 7000 people were deported. About 1200 were granted residency, and an estimated 1000 others stayed on illegally in Australia. Large central mills operated by groups of small farmers eventually supplanted the plantation mills, offering them economy of scale in allowing them to crush their crops at a large and efficient mill. The first two central mills in Queensland were opened near Mackay in the late 1880s, with government financial assistance. The Sugar Works Guarantee Act of 1893 extended the scope of government support to farmers wishing to establish central mills, and thus by the 1890s the small plantation mills on large estates were giving way to small farms and large central mills. The last of the Mackay district's plantation mills, Palms, closed in 1924. From 1870 to 1876 EM Long owned the Branscombe Estate south of the Pioneer River near Walkerston, in partnership with GN Marten. A mill operated here from 1871 to 1884. In addition, Long and Marten owned the River Estate from 1871, with its mill being active from 1873 to 1891. During the 1870s Long also selected multiple blocks of land in the Habana area, north of the Pioneer River, or took over the leases of other selectors. William Robertson did the same, and the two men usually applied to buy their various selections several years after gaining a lease, to obtain deeds of grant. The causeway and wharf site is to the north-east of the current settlement of Habana, and although the causeway begins on the former land of Henry Braby, his selection was an exception in the area in the 1880s, which was by then dominated by the landholdings of Long and Robertson. Braby obtained the lease of selection number 640 in February 1881, for 10 years dating from January 1880, and he was issued with a deed of grant in 1886. A sugar engineer, Braby grew fruit on his selection until about 1894. An August 1880 survey of Braby's selection does not show a causeway, although a road (later Habana Wharf Road) was surveyed in the middle of his selection, terminating near where the start of the causeway would later be located. In January 1882 Long requested, in a letter to the Colonial Secretary, the lease or purchase of a wharf frontage on Salt Water (Constant) Creek, \\"Upon which I am ancsious (sic) to erect a wharf for shipping purposes\\". An August 1882 letter from the Lands Office in Mackay, to the Under Secretary of Lands, Brisbane, noted that it was a good wharfage site, and that Long \\"has already incurred great expense in forming by embankment and drainage a long causeway (to carry a tramway) to this spot\\". A Special Lease, number 169, was granted in September 1882, for 14 years from 1 October 1882, and consisted of a 5-acre wedge of land, rental of per acre per annum. However, the wharf site was not surveyed until February 1884, and a formal Lease for Special Purposes, under the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876, was issued in July 1884, for a period of 14 years from 1 September 1882. The official 1884 survey shows the causeway route, identical to its route in 2010. The causeway began on Brady's selection 640, and then crossed an area of salt marsh, before entering the wharf site. The documentary evidence suggests that the causeway was built between January and August 1882, and that the wharf was built after September 1882. By 1884, a wharf and store were extant at the site. It appears that Long initially used the causeway for horse drawn transport before installing a tramway. South Sea Islander oral histories state that the Habana wharf and the built-up road (causeway) were constructed using South Sea Islander labour. Edward Long relied heavily on South Sea Islander labour to develop his plantations. In a Sydney Morning Herald article dated 27 August 1884 he was quoted as stating: 'The work of a sugar plantation could not be carried on without kanakas. We have them for three years and during that time they are a constant and reliable labour. If you have whites and there should happen to be any disagreement, say at crushing time, they may leave you and your produce will be left on the field.' Oral tradition also asserts that many South Sea Islanders were hurt or killed working with horses at this time, as they were unfamiliar with the animals. The graves of those killed on the project are reportedly on a hill about from the wharf site. During early 1883 all the machinery for the Habana mill was transported through the Habana wharf, then across rough terrain some to the mill site. The mouth of Constant Creek was navigable for steamers up to . Apparently both the Habana and Plane Creek (1896) mills used tramways, leading to their own wharves on convenient creeks, to avoid the cost of carting sugar to Mackay. Rails purchased from Long by the Racecourse Mill, for a rail extension at Cattle Creek, were also shipped out through the Habana wharf in 1904. On Saturday 21 July 1883 the Mackay Mercury reported that there had been a ceremonial first cane crush \\"last Thursday\\" for the opening of Long and Robertson's mill at Habana, which afterwards was celebrated with a ball held at the School of Arts in Mackay. The Habana mill operated from 1883 to 1901. Long applied for a local school and a provisional school was opened c.1883. Long appears to have accepted the end of the plantation system, and from 1884 he pioneered the concept of leasing land to small farmers in order to supply his mill. By 1891 one quarter of Habana's crush came from farmers renting land from the company. Long also encouraged British migration, especially after 1889, and he was an early advocate of Japanese labourers, the first of whom arrived at Habana . By 1893 there were 85 whites working at Habana mill, with 315 Islanders employed. The farming population consisted of 100 white men and women, and 82 Islanders. By 1896 Long and Robertson had 1300 plantation acres under cane, with of tramway, and 26 farmers were supplying Habana Mill. That same year Long applied to renew the lease on the wharf site, and this was granted for ten years, at per acre per annum. In 1896 Long was also the managing director of the Pleystowe Central Mill Company, which illustrates his attempt to straddle the two main systems of sugar production. However, controversy surrounded the dealings between Long and the Government over the establishment of the Pleystowe mill; specifically, over the timing of his land purchases and the granting of government financial assistance for the mill. By 1900 Long had a high, if controversial, public profile. He was the first chairman of the Mackay Harbour Board, (1897-1903), and was a Pioneer Shire councillor between 1880-1881 and 1897-1900. In 1901, the year of the last crush at Habana mill, he was the acting chairman of the Central Sugar Millers' Association of Queensland. A government inquiry into the Pleystowe mill's affairs was announced in February 1902, due to growers' complaints. Long, in hospital in Brisbane at the time, was exonerated of any major misdemeanour. However, the government foreclosed on Pleystowe Central Mill in 1903. It continued to operate, but Long was replaced as manager. Early in 1905 Long fell ill again, and he returned to England for a year's holiday. He died on board ship in the Thames Estuary, 4 August 1905, aged 63. The Habana Provisional School closed in 1906, and in 1907 Robertson decided not to renew the lease on the wharf site. The Land Commissioner, in a letter to the Under Secretary for Public Lands, noted that it was not likely the wharf would be required by anyone for some time to come. In 1908 a tramline reached Habana from Pleystowe Central Mill. The Habana area increased its population in the 1910s and 1920s, through small scale cane farming and dairying. A state school was opened in 1917; immigrants arrived from Malta, Italy, Russia, Greece and India to provide farm labour. By the mid-1920s, there were seven central mills operating around the Mackay area, in contrast to the 30 plantation mills that had been operating in the mid-1880s. The Habana wharf remained as a popular fishing spot for some time, and still existed in the 1930s; however, nothing remains visible of the wharf structure today. To the south of the tramway route across the sand to the wharf site there is a large raised area of stones, about one foot above the surrounding terrain, which may have served as a turn-around point for the trams, and as a work area. Some large decaying posts near and within the mangroves along Constant Creek may be from boat launching activities post-dating the wharf's commercial use. Vehicle access along the causeway has been blocked.  Description  The start of the causeway route is in a field at the north end of the metalled Habana Wharf Road. The causeway, marked by an avenue of paperbark (Melaleuca) trees, is visible to the left as Habana Wharf Road bends to the right towards a private residence. For its initial section the causeway is stone pitched, low-lying, and prone to flooding. It heads west north west and the avenue of trees ends at rising, cleared ground. The route crosses this higher ground before changing direction several degrees to the north. The route then continues as a stone and gravel causeway, standing more than above the surrounding salt marsh. During its course it makes two slight turns to the west, until it is heading almost due west through bush. There are no visible relics of the tramway on the causeway. At one point the causeway intersects a track heading north to a clearing that was the site of a residence. Soon after this point the causeway ends at a sandy beach. A tramway alignment, marked by loose stones and multiple fragments of corroded tramway line of various lengths, continues across the sand towards a line of mangroves. There are several large posts near or within the mangroves, both standing and laid flat. Various other corroded metal artefacts are scattered about. There are two narrow gaps in the line of mangroves by which the creek bank can be accessed. To the south of the rail-alignment is a raised platform of stones, with more fragments of corroded railway line and other metal artefacts. On the other side of the mangroves is the steep muddy bank of a tributary of Constant Creek. No wharf remnants are visible on the creek bank.  Heritage listing  Habana Tramline Causeway and Wharf Site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Habana Tramline Causeway and Wharf Site, developed ca1882, is a product of the 1880-1884 sugar boom in the Mackay district, and is important in demonstrating an early phase in the evolution of Queensland's sugar industry when the plantation system dominated. The causeway and wharf were built by South Sea Islander labour to serve the Habana Sugar Mill (1883-1901), a plantation mill owned by well-known public and sugar industry figure Edward Maitland Long. The plantation system, dependent on South Sea Islander indentured labour, peaked in the early 1880s, after which it was gradually supplanted by the central mill system serving small cane farms worked by white labour. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The substantially intact Habana Tramline Causeway provides rare surviving evidence of a large construction project undertaken with South Sea Islander labour before the Pacific Island Labourers (Extension) Act 1892 barred them from construction work on plantation roads and tramways. The route of the causeway across salt marsh to a wharf site on a navigable creek, the raised profile of the causeway, and the remnants of the tramline, provide uncommon evidence of key transport infrastructure associated with a nineteenth century coastal Queensland sugar plantation. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The Habana wharf site, with its numerous metal tramway artefacts and raised stone work platform, has the archaeological potential to contribute to a greater understanding of the operation of a nineteenth century sugar plantation wharf. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Habana Tramline Causeway and Wharf Site are important and now rare evidence of the significant contribution made by South Sea Islanders to the establishment of a viable sugar industry in colonial Queensland, including the establishment of its transport infrastructure. With a number of deaths of Islander labourers said to have occurred there during its construction, the place has a symbolic association with these people and the difficult lives they led while indentured to work in Australia.

It was part of Howard County Public School System. History Harriet Tubman School was the last operating segregated school in the Howard County Public School System. The historic building has been re-purposed for use by the school system for maintenance offices. Howard County's first classes for African American children beyond 7th grade was held in Cooksville in 1937. The four room school house expanded to 11 grade levels by 1939 to become the county's sole school offering high school level classes. The Harriet Tubman school, in Simpsonville, was established as the first dedicated high school for African Americans in 1948 with the first graduating class in 1952. In July 1953, an addition designed by Francis J Thurman was built by Aetna Construction Company for $67,944 increasing the size of the school to . In 1956, a $50,000 shop building was approved while the school board was under scrutiny for delaying integration of Howard County Schools after the supreme court ruling. Harriet Tubman operated for 16 years as a segregated school and was closed rather than integrated. The school closed in 1965. An all new school known as Atholton High was championed to be built on the same property by local residents rather than integrate white students into the Harriet Tubman School. The Rouse Company had recently bought land adjacent to the school and planned to sell back at cost to the school board. In July 1964, Tom Harris of the planning commission presented a recommendation from Loren Murray of Johannes & Murray to pass on any additions to the Harriet Tubman school and buy the adjoining for $12,000 from Columbia Research and Development to build an all new high school. A public effort has been underway since the early 2000s to turn over the building for a Cultural Center.

The system originated from a monsoon trough that coalesced into a tropical low over the Timor Sea on 12 December. The system initially moved southwest, before moving on a more westerly course. Steady intensification occurred and Ilona reached its peak strength on 17 December as a low-end severe tropical cyclone. A southward turn directed the cyclone toward Western Australia, and it made landfall near Mardie Station. The system subsequently degraded over land and dissipated on 19 December. The cyclone's effects were relatively limited, though locally significant damage was reported in areas such as Dampier and Karratha. Several homes lost their roof and downed power lines left towns without power for several days. No casualties were reported, damage amounted to A$1 million (US$725,000), and the name Ilona was retired after the season. Meteorological history A monsoon trough was noted along the coast of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to sporadic heavy rain in the region. On 12 December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00 UTC on 13 December, the low was classified as a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. Decelerating somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status‚Äîhaving ten-minute sustained winds of at least ‚Äîaround 12:00 UTC on 15 December. Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00 UTC. Ilona turned south, and later south-southeast, on 15 December and began a steady approach to Western Australia. Slight intensification took place, with the cyclone achieving its peak strength around 00:00 UTC on 17 December with ten-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a barometric pressure of 960 hPa (mbar; 28.35 inHg). The JTWC estimated Ilona to be slightly stronger, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph)‚Äîa Category 2-equivalent on the SSHS. That day, Ilona passed near the North Rankin gas platform. Around 16:00 UTC, the eye of Ilona made landfall near Mardie Station. Around 16:30 UTC, the center of Ilona passed over the town, with a five minute period of calm observed. An eye passage was also reported in Fortescue Roadhouse. The cyclone rapidly decayed as it accelerated inland, falling below tropical cyclone strength by 00:00 UTC on 19 December, at which time it was situated northeast of Meekatharra. Thereafter, the decaying low turned east and ultimately dissipated later that day just west of the Western Australia‚ÄìSouth Australia border. Preparations and impact On 15 December, areas across Pilbara were placed on alert for the storm's arrival; however, as the storm continued west, the alert was dropped. The warning was quickly reinstated when forecasts showed Ilona moving south. Officials indicated that residents had roughly 12 hours to fully prepare. Striking Pilbara as a severe tropical cyclone, Ilona caused significant damage in the region; however, the sparsely populated nature of the region limited the extent of severe damage. Mardie Station was buffeted by hurricane-force winds with gusts up to . An unconfirmed report indicated gusts as high as . These winds uprooted trees, downed power lines, and tore roofs from homes in multiple locales; extensive damage occurred in Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, Pannawonica, and Tom Price. Homes and caravans sustained damage in Karratha, reportedly the hardest-hit area according to State Emergency Services. Affected areas were without power for several days, and crews from Port Hedland were called in to assist. Heavy rains also accompanied the system, with accumulations exceeding across much of Pilbara, breaking December records at the time; two-day accumulations exceeded in some locations. The rainfall was mostly beneficial to the region. Offshore, the combined effects of Cyclones Ilona and Orson in March 1989 caused tremendous damage to coral reefs‚Äîmainly populated by Acropora‚Äîin eastern areas of Mermaid Sound. Turbulent waters killed or broke apart 50‚Äì100% of the living coral across all sites in the sound. In coastal Dampier, 12 boats sank, capsized, or were washed ashore. Damage amounted to A$1 million (US$725,000). Though no casualties were reported, the effects of Ilona were deemed severe enough for its name to be retired after the season.

Kilkenny United WFC played in the Women's National League until 2019, but won only one match in five seasons.  History  = 2015‚Äì16 = In July 2015 the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) announced the formation of the club as an expansion team for the upcoming 2015‚Äì16 Women's National League season. The club played its first match on 19 July 2015, hosting Celtic at Buckley Park. Ahead of the first WNL season experienced campaigner Sylvia Gee was signed, to add experience to a youthful squad. In game week 8 of the 2015-16 season Kilkenny United recorded their first ever draw and put their first ever point on the table. They drew 1‚Äì1 with Cork City W.F.C.. There was a few close games for Kilkenny in their first ever season in the league but they ended the campaign with a solitary point on the board. = 2016 = Kilkenny recorded their first win in the 2016 season when they were drawn against Lakewood in the quarter finals of the FAI Women's Senior Cup. Kilkenny came out 3‚Äì1 winners with goals from Jenny O'Keeffe, Niamh Kelly and Hannah Scott. Kilkenny United commenced to the semi finals of the cup but lost out to a strong Wexford Youths W.F.C. in the semi finals. The 2016 League campaign didn't go as planned for Kilkenny with the club failing to pick up any points throughout the season. Although the club didn't manage to get any points on the board it was a great learning experience for a young Kilkenny squad. = 2017 = The 2017 season didn't start as planned as Kilkenny went through numerous managers before finally getting the right man for the job on 20 June 2017. Kilkenny United appointed Casey McQuillan who had much experience in the league from previously managing Shelbourne L.F.C. and Raheny United FC. On 9 July 2017, history was made for Kilkenny in Thomastown when Kilkenny won their first and only game in the Women's National League. They beat Galway W.F.C 1‚Äì0 which was a very historic day for the club. The Kilkenny goal came from Leanne Tumelty. Kilkenny United ended the season with the single 3 points and single win on the board. It was a very progressive season for the club on and off the field. Kilkenny also recorded a win in the quarter finals of the FAI Women's Senior Cup when they beat TEK United 3‚Äì1. Kilkenny's goals were scored by Jennifer Chambers (2) and Sylvia Gee. Kilkenny were drawn against UCD Waves in the semi finals of the cup but slipped at the last hurdle and lost out on a trip to the Aviva Stadium. = 2018 = At the start of the 2018 season Casey McQuillan stepped down as manager of the club. Kilkenny signed many new experienced players including Carla McMannus who is an ex-Ireland women's under 17s player. Kilkenny also kept players with great experience at the club including Nicole Plunkett, Niamh Kelly and Bronagh Kane to name a few. Kilkenny started off the 2018 season at debutantes Limerick WFC and were beaten 4‚Äì0. The club introduced an Under 16 squad which was entered into the Kilkenny & District League. On 12 July 2018 Kilkenny United announced a link up with Real Football academy Swans. They announced their intention to set up a pathway to the Women's National League for the Real FA Swans players. = 2019 = In 2019 an inexperienced Kilkenny United team endured another torrid season, garnering only two points and sustaining a series of hurtful drubbings. The club's off- field operation also began to unravel. Matches were hosted on a public park, while the club lacked its own youth system. Dismissal from the Women's National League The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) unexpectedly threw Kilkenny United out of the Women's National League ahead of the 2020 season. The reasons given included the club's failure to bond with their local women's leagues, changing their home ground, not training in Kilkenny, having an unqualified coach, failing to fulfil a fixture and having consistently poor results and feeble performances. The club disagreed with the FAI's decision and after a failed appeal, released a lengthy statement in January 2020. The club decided to continue playing at Wexford League level and re-emerged in August 2020.

During the 1934 Grand Prix season ‚Äì the first season of the infamous Silver Arrows period of German dominance of Grand Prix racing, that would last until the outbreak of WWII ‚Äì he drove for the Auto Union Rennabteilung, and was the first driver of a Silver Arrows car to take a podium finish in a major race. During the season he took a further second-placed finish, and posted two fastest laps, but worsening arthritis and a deteriorating relationship with the Auto Union team manager forced him into retirement before the end of the year. Following his retirement from racing, Momberger returned to his engineering training and rose steadily through the ranks of the German automobile industry, eventually becoming technical director of the Borgward company's Goliath division in Bremen. Racing career Born in Wiesbaden, Hesse-Nassau, in 1905, Momberger began racing in hillclimbing events in the early 1920s while he was still an engineering apprentice at the NSU works. In August 1925, he won the International Taunus Race driving an experimental, supercharged NSU 6/60 PS car. In winning this race ‚Äì a forerunner to the first German Grand Prix the following year ‚Äì Momberger defeated works entries from many of the international motor industry including Mercedes and Bugatti. Momberger remained with NSU for the 1926 Grand Prix season but was unable to emulate his form of the previous year. For the 1927 Grand Prix season, Momberger switched his affiliation to Bugatti, and took this new car to the 5000 cc class victory at the inaugural Eifelrennen meeting celebrating the opening of the N√ºrburgring in June of that year. In September, again driving his Bugatti T35B, he won the 3-litre class at the Rund um die Solitude race on the Solitudering track, near Stuttgart. He retained the Bugatti into 1928, but did not take any notable results during the year, and failed to finish the 1928 German Grand Prix at the N√ºrburgring. =Mercedes-Benz (1929‚Äì1931)= Momberger joined the Daimler-Benz factory team for the 1929 Grand Prix season, driving the firm's new Mercedes-Benz SSK cars. His first event for his new team was the 1929 Rome Grand Prix. He started from fifth position on the grid, but during the race his car encountered difficulties with its supercharger and he retired at the end of the tenth lap. In July, Momberger was entered for the 1929 German Grand Prix, again to be contested over the full N√ºrburgring circuit. He finished in third place, behind two Bugattis driven by Louis Chiron and Georges Philippe. Later in the year, Momberger was entered for the Monza Grand Prix. He won the third qualifying heat, but could only finish third in the race final, beaten by Achille Varzi's Alfa Romeo and Tazio Nuvolari in a Talbot. Following the 1929 season, Momberger retired from racing, but was again drafted as a reserve driver for Mercedes in 1931. However, he did not participate in any events. =Auto Union (1934)= In 1934 he was hired as a reserve driver by the Auto Union Grand Prix team, to provide support for their primary drivers Hans Stuck and Hermann zu Leiningen. The 1934 season saw the introduction of a new regulation formula for Grand Prix- class racing, which mandated a maximum weight for cars of and a minimum race distance of . To meet this new challenge, engineer Ferdinand Porsche laid out the design for a novel V16-powered, rear-engined car, that eventually became the Auto Union Type A. Auto Union decided to delay their entry to the season's racing until their first home event, the 1934 Avusrennen in May. For this race, Auto Union entered three cars, to be driven by Stuck, Leiningen and Momberger. New cars from their compatriots and rivals, Mercedes, had been withdrawn following pump troubles, so the main competition for the Auto Union team came from Scuderia Ferrari's streamlined Alfa Romeos. From the start Stuck took the lead, which he built to over 85 seconds on the high-speed AVUS circuit, before his clutch failed on lap 12 of the planned 15. By this point, Leiningen had already retired with a faulty radiator, so it was left to Momberger to challenge the Italian cars, and he set the fastest lap of the race at an average of over while chasing the lead. Ultimately, he finished the race in third position, almost two minutes behind race winner Guy Moll's Alfa Romeo, but only 18 seconds behind Moll's team mate Achille Varzi. The Auto Union team's next race, in early June, was also on German soil: the 1934 Eifelrennen on the N√ºrburgring. For this race, the Mercedes-Benz team brought three fully functional W25 cars to challenge the three Auto Union entries. However, Momberger was unable to lend support to his team leader, Stuck, as his fuel pump failed early in the race. Stuck went on to finish second to Manfred von Brauchitsch's Mercedes. Drivers wait in their cars prior to the start of the 1934 French Grand Prix. Momberger is in car 10, on the second row The second Grande √âpreuve of the season ‚Äì the 1934 French Grand Prix at the Montlh√©ry Autodrome on 1 July ‚Äì again saw all three Auto Union cars entered, although following more fuel pump troubles only Stuck and Momberger started the race. Stuck started from pole position, with Momberger in fourth place in the starting grid ballot. However, from the start Momberger suffered from mechanical problems and rapidly dropped toward the rear of the 13 car field, with only Tazio Nuvolari's misfiring Bugatti behind him, and he became the race's first retirement when his steering finally failed on lap 10. Two weeks later the Auto Union team entered five cars for their home grand prix, the 1934 German Grand Prix at the N√ºrburgring, with cars for Stuck and Momberger, joined by Ernst Burggaller, who was standing in for an unwell Leiningen, and reserves Paul Pietsch and Wilhelm Sebastian. During the race the German cars dominated, and Momberger was running in the leading group of cars, in fourth place, albeit more than eight minutes behind the leader, Stuck, after nearly four hours of racing. However, his car hit mechanical trouble on his 20th lap and he was forced to retire. During the German race, Momberger had injured his head when he hit it on the headrest of his car while going over one of the N√ºrburgring's numerous bumps, and he had to be replaced by Burggaller (whose own car had already retired) while he had the bleeding attended to. Having missed the next Grande √âpreuve due to customs and duty tariff disputes between the German teams and Belgian border agents, for the team's next appearance at the 1934 Coppa Acerbo in August, Auto Union team boss Willi Walb replaced Momberger with Sebastian. However, by the time of the 1934 Swiss Grand Prix at the end of the month Momberger had regained his position in the Auto Union line-up. For the Circuit Bremgarten race Auto Union entered the established Stuck-Leiningen-Momberger trio. Stuck started from pole position once again, but Momberger's draw in the start ballot placed him alongside Earl Howe on the last row of the grid. In the race Stuck led from the first, although was closely followed by Ren√© Dreyfus in a Bugatti T59. Momberger chased the leaders hard, setting the race's fastest lap in the process, and by lap 25 was lying in third position. However, a late stop by Dreyfus to top up his radiator allowed Momberger through into second position. The two Auto Union cars finished the race in formation, fewer than three seconds apart as they crossed the line after more than three and a half hours of racing, a lap ahead of Dreyfus. This was Auto Union's first 1-2 finish, and would prove to be Momberger's best-ever result in Grand Prix competition. Two weeks later, the Auto Union team were again out in force for the 1934 Italian Grand Prix. The race was held on a chicane-peppered ad hoc adaptation of the Monza Autodrome ‚Äì designed to improve safety at the notoriously dangerous track ‚Äì and the winning Mercedes of Rudolf Caracciola took almost five hours to complete the scheduled 116 laps, at an average speed of only just over . Owing to its gruelling nature, both Momberger and team-leader Stuck had to call in their reserve substitutes for periods of the race. Sebastian stepped in for Momberger on lap 38, and the pair's car finished in seventh position, four laps down on the winner. Unfortunately for Momberger, by this point in the season worsening arthritis prevented him from taking part in the 1934 Spanish Grand Prix in September, and Auto Union entered only two cars for Stuck and Leiningen, with Momberger attending as a reserve. The condition had not improved by the end of the month and Walb decided to formally replace Momberger with Sebastian for the next race, Auto Union's final entry of the season, in Brno. The combined effects of his debilitating illness and a deteriorating relationship with team manager Walb persuaded Momberger to retire from competitive driving for good at the end of the 1934 season, and he moved sideways into the management of Auto Union.

The album was released on 22 January 2016 through InsideOut. Background Nick Beggs began to put a band together at the suggestion of Thomas Waber, of record label InsideOut. In 2014, Beggs approached Roger King ‚Äî a fellow member of Steve Hackett's band for several years ‚Äî with the suggestion that King would produce Beggs' new band; King took up the offer. Beggs also called on the services of drummer Marco Minnemann, with whom had toured as part of Steven Wilson's solo band. Beggs revealed that he wrote the majority of the album while on tour in 2014. Beggs announced the creation of his new group, The Mute Gods, in August 2015, and two months later revealed that their debut album, Do Nothing till You Hear from Me, would be released in January 2016. Minnemann, who is featured on most of the album's tracks, contributed some guitar parts and sound modelling to the album, in addition to drums. Nick D'Virgilio and Gary O'Toole are also represented on the album as guest drummers. In November 2015, the band released two videos for the album's title track. One is a 'normal' music video, while the other is a 360 degree video, directed by Crystal Spotlight. Two weeks before the scheduled release of the album, a video for \\"Feed the Troll\\" was also released. A video for \\"Father Daughter\\" was released on 22 January, to coincide with the album's release. Two further promo videos were released later in 2016, for \\"Praying To A Mute God\\" and \\"Night School For Idiots\\" respectively. Themes Beggs has described Do Nothing till You Hear from Me as \\"a rather disgruntled rant at the dystopia we've created for ourselves and our children\\". He further opines that \\"The people in this world who should be listened to are often the ones who are silenced. The voice of reason seems strangely quiet in the face of so much media disinformation\\". The title track, \\"Do Nothing till You Hear from Me\\", was inspired by former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's warning about the potential rise of the military‚Äìindustrial complex, as well as the geologist Phil Schneider, who made several claims regarding UFOs in the 1990s, before dying under mysterious circumstances. According to Beggs, the title \\"sums up how I feel about religion\\". Beggs also singles out the tracks \\"Swimming Horses\\" and \\"Feed the Troll\\". The former is as \\"a warning about the passing of time and the rising of tides\\", and the latter, as the title suggests, relates to trolls, described by Beggs as people \\"who have too much time on their hands\\". The album is dedicated to the late Yes bassist Chris Squire.Do Nothing till You Hear from Me liner notes. Track listing All songs written and composed by Nick Beggs, except where noted.

Race and Juvenile Justice in Twentieth‚ÄêCentury Texas is a 2010 book by William S. Bush, published by the University of Georgia Press. It discusses the juvenile corrections system of Texas and the cycles of attempts at reform and the failures of these attempts.Diamond, p. 616. The book chronicles conflicts between people wishing to reform the juvenile justice system and make it rehabilitate versus those who were favoring imprisonment.Wintz. It also discusses how officials perceived non-Hispanic White prisoners to be reformable while African-Americans and Hispanic prisoners were viewed as un-reformable; they believed that only younger white persons were capable of reforming.MacLeod, p. 240. According to Diamond, Who Gets a Childhood?'s \\"most important innovation involves its handling of the social, political, and cultural forces‚Äîlocal, state, and national‚Äîthat shaped the conditions within these institutions.\\" Background Sources used to write the book which originated from the Gatesville State School, the Texas Board of Control, and the Texas Youth Commission, include member files and annual reports. Summary statistics of internal narrative case files, newspaper articles, legal cases, Texas state legislation, and court testimony from defendants were also used. Jennifer Trost of Utica College wrote that the author does not \\"seem\\" to be in possession of the case files themselves.Trost, p. 164. Content The book is written chronologically.Blackwell, p. 524. Most of the book's content discusses Texas's juvenile correctional facilities, with the content beginning with the Gatesville State School, first established in 1889. The book also discusses how theories on adolescence, penology and juvenile delinquency changed over time; the contrast between more and less innocuous media depictions of juvenile delinquents; statistics on the juvenile inmates, their crimes, and their attributes; and what David I. MacLeod of Central Michigan University described as \\"at least hinting at changing political climates in Texas.\\"MacLeod, p. 241. The book discusses how prisoners dealt with their sentences and time at the juvenile correctional facilities, illustrated by the use of personal papers and case studies. Deborah L. Blackwell of Texas A&M; International University referred to this as \\"one of the most interesting elements\\" of Who Gets a Childhood? There are portions discussing community corrections programs for juveniles in Houston. Andrew J. Diamond of the Center for International Studies and Research in Paris, France stated that book focuses on the 1910s through the 1920s and the 1940s through the 1970s. MacLeod described the book as being focused on the 1910s, 1940s, and 1960s through 1980s, \\"loosely structured around multiple cycles of tentative reform\\". Diamond stated that there is very little content about the 1980s and 1990s, and that the scope of the book is \\"more limited\\" than what the title would suggest. According to MacLeod, many of the paragraphs come from \\"disparate\\" topics and are very long, and that a reader may be confused by \\"digressive passages\\" and \\"abrupt shifts of focus\\". In addition MacLeod stated \\"The level of detail can, however, overwhelm a reader at times.\\" According to Trost the juvenile justice analysis related to the 1930s-1950s was new, while there had been previous research related to 1890s-1920s and 1960s covered by previous books. According to Trost, the author \\"has lined up with the founders of the juvenile system in favor of treatment for individuals rather than punishment of crimes.\\"Trost, p. 165. Reception Diamond concluded that \\"Bush‚Äôs multilayered analysis of some seven decades of Texas juvenile justice breaks new ground in a number of ways, and it should be required reading for anyone working at the intersection of race and juvenile justice in the twentieth century.\\" Diamond stated that there were some \\"minor shortcomings\\" related to dealing with race and civil rights issues in a \\"schematic manner\\"; he argued that the book was too vague on the role of Mexicans and how they were treated as people unable to reform, and Diamond also stated that the book did not connect how the black power movement resulted in correctional authorities trying to imprison black juveniles in more restrictive facilities. He also stated that the book did not give enough attention to the role of prison gangs.Diamond, p. 617. C. D. Wintz of Texas Southern University stated that he highly recommended the book and gave it three stars. MacLeod concluded that \\"the book under review is an immensely informative account of the complexities of reform and repression within the training schools of a state known for its tough penal culture.\\" References Blackwell, Deborah L.

When in SeaFrance service the passenger areas accounted for the upper two decks, with the lower decks used for the vehicles. Lay-up and incidents Between 16 November 2011 and 20 August 2012 she was laid up in Calais Port, due to the commercial court ordering that SeaFrance be liquidated. During her time laid up in Calais, she was involved in a collision with another vessel within the port vicinity. During a gale, with winds of around 50 knots, she parted her moorings and drifted across the water towards the cable vessel √éle de Batz owned by the Louis Dreyfus Group. Damage was sustained to her starboard bridge wing which resulted in shattered windows and crushed roofing. Minimal damage was caused to the √éle de Batz, which later departed for a nearby port for quick repairs. A tug owned by the Port of Calais was soon on the scene to assist. She resumed service with MyFerryLink on 20 August 2012, dropping SeaFrance from her name. On the 27 October 2012 the Pride of Burgundy collided with Berlioz resulting in damage to her lifeboats, which meant the ship had to be pulled out of service.

Early works  Walker's early imagery aligned with outsider art and tattoo culture. In the mid-1980s, he produced photograms developed from scratched drawings on plastic, large manipulated black-and-white photographs, sculpture and miniature landscapes, and small oil paintings on panel that evolved into larger works on paper.Theriault, M.

Recent works  Douglas Walker creates dreamy scenes of bleak and beautiful landscapes and architectural structures in his distinctive blue-and-white style. His creative influences include suspension bridges, landscapes by J. M. W. Turner, paint jobs on funny cars, skyscraper drawings by Hugh Ferriss, chinoiserie, moon paintings by Chesley Bonestell, blue and white pottery, pin-ups by Alberto Vargas, botanical illustrations, the DIY technique of Henri Rousseau, airbrush illustrations of tools in old catalogues, the fantasies of John Martin, Chinese brush paintings, and children‚Äôs books. In his oil-on-masonite works, Walker simulates the effects of time by using a resist technique of his own creation to instil crackles and scratches over elegant brush techniques.

It was part of the Leningrad Front and was formed on 1 September 1941. The army fought in the Sinyavino Offensive, Lyuban Offensive Operation and the Battle of Krasny Bor. On 25 December 1943, it was combined with the 67th Army.  History  Soldiers on the Leningrad Front in September 1941 The 55th Army was formed on 1 September 1941 as part of the Leningrad Front. It was formed from the Task Force of Major General I.G. Lazarev and the 19th Rifle Corps headquarters. The army fought in the Leningrad Strategic Defensive Operation. At the time, it was the largest of the four armies defending Leningrad, with up to half of the active formations.Using the defenses of the Slutsk-Kolpino Fortified Area, the army defended Leningrad's southern approaches in the area of Kolpino, Krasnogvardeysk, Zaborje, Vyritsa, the Izhora River and the Tosna River. Its units stopped the German advance at Putrolovo (ru), Bolshoye Kuzmino, Novaya and Verkhneye Kuzmino. From October 1941 to December 1942, the army carried out local offensives to improve its positions. In November, Vladimir Sviridov replaced Lazarev. On 20 December the army began an attack at Mga, later joined by the 54th Army, to distract from the upcoming Lyuban Offensive Operation but was unsuccessful. On 23 July 1942 a rifle division and a tank brigade of the army attacked the SS Polizei Division south of Kolpino. The attack made some gains.On 26 September elements of two of the army's rifle divisions were sent across the Neva to reinforce the encircled 8th Army. After losing two of three bridgeheads, the 55th Army units withdrew across the Neva. = Battle of Krasny Bor = In February 1943, the army fought in the Battle of Krasny Bor. The army was the left pincer of the offensive and was to attack out of Kolpino and destroy the Blue Division at Krasny Bor, then advance southeast to Tosno. A division-size attack on 8 February forced several Blue Division outposts back. On 10 February, the 55th Army attacked simultaneously with the 54th Army. The 55th Army attacked along a front of 14 kilometers, concentrating three rifle division and a tank brigade against one regiment of the Blue Division. The Soviet troops broke through the Spanish line and the army's 63rd Guards Rifle Division advanced into and captured Krasny Bor. On the army's left, its 43rd Rifle Division attacked a regiment of the SS Polizei Division, but was unable to advance. German reinforcements arrived and formed a new defensive line south of Krasny Bor, stopping the advance of the 55th Army. The army brought up its tank units and resumed the offensive towards Mishkino (ru) on 17 February but was again repulsed by Tiger tanks of Panzer- Abteilung 502. During the offensive, the army advanced five kilometers and suffered more than 10,000 casualties. The army inflicted 3,645 casualties on the Blue Division. On 19 March, the army attacked again in conjunction with the 8th Army, but was forced to retreat by counterattacks from Legion Flandern and Panzer-Abteilung 502. On 25 December 1943, the army was combined with the 67th Army.  Composition  On 1 September 1941, the army contained the following units. * 70th Rifle Division * 90th Rifle Division * 168th Rifle Division * 237th Rifle Division * 1st People's Militia Division * 4th People's Militia Division * 2nd Rifle Regiment * Slutsk-Kolpino Fortified Area  Commanders  Major General Ivan Gavrilovich Lazarev (01/09/1941 - 17/11/1941), * Major General of Artillery, from August 1943 Lieutenant General Vladimir Petrovich Sviridov (17/11/1941 - 15/12/1943);  References   * Category:Field armies of the Soviet Union Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1943 ","title":"55th Army (Soviet Union)"},{"id":"48983721","title":"2016 Mongolian Premier League"},{"id":"48983733","text":"Acalolepta fuscosericea is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae found in Asia in countries such as the Philippines., Category:Acalolepta Category:Beetles described in 1931 ","title":"Acalolepta fuscosericea"},{"id":"48983753","text":"Maurice Dunne (born 23 December 1955) is a racing driver, active in years 1975-1989 He is of Irish nationality, and lives in Rathfarnham, Dublin, Ireland. thumb Career =1975= He started in the Mondello Racing Drivers School under John and Marijka Murphy in Mondello Park Donore, Co.

It was designed in 1923 by Lange Leopold Powell and built by A Stonage and Sons, completing in 1926. It is also known as Holy Trinity Church Complex. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003.  History  The Holy Trinity Church, Mackay was constructed as the third church on the site and the first masonry church. The building was completed in 1926, although the design is thought to have been completed by 1923 by Brisbane architect Lange Powell. The church precinct was supplemented by a parish hall and rectory in the late 1930s. The Church of England Diocese of Brisbane was formed at the time of Queensland's establishment as a separate colony in 1859 and took over what had been the Newcastle Diocese which had extended ten miles north of present-day Mackay. North of this area remained within the Diocese of Sydney. The district discovered by John Mackay in 1860 was thus already within a defined ecclesiastical district and Mackay alone, of the parishes of Northern Queensland, had been under the auspices of the Brisbane Diocese since the separation of Queensland. Mackay was later incorporated into the Diocese of North Queensland which was formed in 1878. John Mackay and his party had discovered what was to become the Pioneer Valley in 1860. The present city blocks were surveyed in June 1863 when the settlement consisted of several dozen huts and tents in a line along a track parallel to the southern bank of the river, and the first land sale was held at the police office, Bowen, on 13 October 1863. Among the speculators was Edward Wyndham Tufnell, Bishop of the Church of England, Brisbane, who purchased six lots in the heart of town for . A further twenty acres of land on what is now Nebo Road was purchased by Bishop Tufnell at a later date. While early settlers in Mackay were cattlemen, it was soon realised that the soil, climate and rainfall were suitable for the growing of sugar-cane. The growth of the sugar industry was accelerated by the Sugar and Coffee Regulations of 1864 and by the 1880s a system of plantation agriculture had developed. The first Church of England service in Mackay was conducted by Bishop Tufnell at the Mackay Court House in 1863. By 1867 the Parish of Mackay was established and land for the construction of a church was purchased on 11 August 1869. The building of the church at a time of depressed economic circumstances reflects a strong commitment by the congregation to their religious beliefs. None of the six town lots purchased by Bishop Tufnell was used for the site of the first Holy Trinity Church. The first Trinity church was completed in 1871 of an English design with a steeply pitched roof covered with wood shingles. It was built of stone but collapsed in 1878 possibly because of a defect in the foundations. The Mackay Mercury reported on 10 March 1878: > \\"Last Sunday morning, during the heavy rainfall, we regret to state that the > gable end of Trinity Church fell with a great crash and destroyed a > considerable portion of the altar and Church furniture. The building had > been in a dangerous state for some time past and, judging from the numerous > cracks in the walls, and imperfect foundations, it is a wonder it has stood > for so long.\\" Second Holy Trinity Anglican church at Mackay Second Holy Trinity Church and Rectory, circa 1885 Services were held in the Oddfellows' Hall, Sydney Street, until 1879 when a second church was consecrated. By 1884 the Mackay Parish complex consisted of a \\"large, beautifully appointed Church, a large Sunday School building and a neat cottage for a parsonage\\". During the late 1880s a ladies' committee was formed to raise funds and this committee contributed towards the cost of a new parsonage. The term \\"parsonage\\" became obsolete after 24 years and \\"rectory\\" was substituted. left The second Holy Trinity Church was designed by the Queensland Colonial Architect, F D G Stanley, who supplied the plans free of charge. The building was constructed of wood, and was of a Gothic design with a steeply pitched roof covered with shingles, sited on the southern side of the grounds and capable of holding a congregation of 500. This Church was fitted with a pipe organ, an altar of carved English oak, and carved oak rails in memory of prominent people with strong associations with Holy Trinity Parish. Lighting was by gas, with ornate brass standards, about seven feet tall, each surmounted by a cluster of three lamps representing the Trinity. The second church was destroyed in the 1918 Mackay cyclone. A temporary church was constructed from salvaged timber and a fundraising drive was conducted throughout Australia. In 1923 the estimate for the new building was but by time of construction in 1926 the cost had risen to . This resulted in modifications to the original plan which had included an imposing bell tower, high and square at the base. The plan also incorporated an arcade which would have been on the east side of the land. The design of the third church is believed to be similar to that of the Mission Church of the Order of Saint John which was seen by Canon Reginald Halse in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. It suggests the style of a Spanish church with the addition of open verandahs to allow for the harsh northern climate. The incumbent Rector, Canon Fortesque Leo Ash, arranged for a Warriors' Chapel as an integral part of the building in memory of those who had died in World War I. The architect was Lange Leopold Powell and the builders were A Stonage and Sons. The church, together with a rectory and a parish hall occupies a city block. The church was designed in 1923 and completed in 1926. Lange L Powell was an early twentieth century architect who practised in partnership with Claude Chambers as Chambers and Powell from 1911 until 1920; and then with Beatrice Hutton as Powell and Hutton from 1922 until 1924. When Powell designed the Holy Trinity Church, Mackay he was in private practice. During his long career as an architect Powell designed many prominent buildings, including St Martins Hospital and the Masonic Temple in Ann Street, Brisbane. In his design of the Holy Trinity Church, Powell used a blend of Romanesque, Spanish Mission and Mediterranean architectural styles, all popular during the inter-war period. A similar eclecticism was used by architect Eric Ford of Brisbane's Chambers and Ford on the design of the Holy Trinity Church at Woolloongabba in Brisbane. The massing and detailing of these two churches illustrates the use of Romanesque architecture which was popularised in America from the late nineteenth century by architect, Henry Hobson Richardson. That the churches are rendered with smooth cast stucco suggests strongly an overriding Spanish Mission influence. Many of the memorials within the Holy Trinity Church are relics of the first and second churches which were salvaged and incorporated in the present building. In the mid 1930s the early Rectory was condemned and the hall, built in 1918, required repairs. A new hall was constructed in a style to complement the church and it was proposed that the hall be built large enough for dances, meetings or general entertainment so that rental would pay off the building. The hall had 4000 square feet of floor space, a small hall for kindergarten, Sunday School and rooms for guilds and meetings. The hall was built during 1937-38 and the Rectory, constructed between the church and the hall, was built in 1939. The Queensland Premier William Forgan Smith specifically travelled to Mackay for the opening of the parish hall on 4 September 1937. The foundation stone for the hall was laid by Premier W Forgan Smith in 1937. The architect was Harold Brown and the contractor was Queensland Engineering. The building was constructed at a cost of . The Mackay Daily Mercury reported on the 6 September 1937 at the laying of the foundation stone: > \\"the hope was that the hall would be the centre of culture for the city - > physical culture, arts, drama and music - as well as providing rooms for > smaller meetings for social, religious, and industrial purposes. The hall > would be used a great deal for Church purposes and also for other social > occasions that were well run and for the benefit of the people.\\" The church hall was officially opened by the Bishop of North Queensland, Dr John Feetham, 19 April 1938, at a mask and domino ball reported by the Mackay Daily Mercury as needing little extra in the way of decoration owing to the aesthetic surroundings, but the lighting effects and the outstanding artistry of the interior required nothing in the way of additional support to add to the pleasure of patrons. The rectory constructed in 1939 between the church and the hall was designed in a style to complement the other buildings. It became a Parish Centre when a new rectory was built in 1974. The existing church and hall, although not original, remains one of the few building complexes occupying an original site in the district.  Description  Holy Trinity Church of England in Mackay, 1938 The Holy Trinity Church Complex is located one block south of Victoria Street, the main commercial street of Mackay, on the corner of Gordon and Sydney Streets which is a major thoroughfare through the city. = The Church = The Holy Trinity Church is a substantial rendered masonry building sited on a north-south axis. The principal facade of the building faces north to Gordon Street. Front elevation has decorative parapet including dentil course and raked arch motif below the eaves line and crucifix finial. A central rose window is filled with coloured and leaded glass panel. The entry is defined by an arched gabled entry portico with twisted \\"barley sugar\\" columns. The exterior is rendered with smooth white stucco. The gabled roof of the building is clad with red painted wide gauge corrugated iron roof which simulates terra cotta tiles. Along the outside of the nave is an arcaded arched colonnade loggia. The interior of the building comprises a nave with the aisles surmounted by clerestory lighting. Lining the side elevations of the church are round-arched window openings. The clerestory windows are in pairs and filled with coloured glass. Below are glazed doors in geometrical patterned coloured glass. The interior is also rendered with white stucco and has a cruciform plan. In one transept is the Warriors' chapel with three stained glass windows of St George, St Michael and St Alban. This chapel is divided form the body of the church through three round arched openings. At the rear is an organ loft on four columns. The ceiling is vaulted, with cross vaults at the bays of the engaged piers. There are many memorials within the church, including several retrieved from earlier churches on the site. There is also a cedar Bishop's throne which could also be from an earlier church. The sanctuary arch is flanked by marble Corinthian columns. A simple marble altar sits within the half domes space of the sanctuary. = The Residence = The residence is between the other buildings, set back from the street screened by a tropical garden. The residence is also rendered with white stucco and has a decorative front parapet, and a group of three round arch windows on the principal elevation. The roof is clad with red corrugated iron. Stepped fronted residence, gabled roof apart from the front parapet. The interior includes chevron decorative ceilings. = Parish Hall = The front of the Hall faces north to Gordon Street. A foundation stone is at front of the building. The hall is a rectangular building on the same orientation as the church, north-south axis, but slightly larger. It too is rendered with white stucco and has decorative parapets repeating the raked arched motif of the church. The parapets are capped with terra-cotta tiles. The front facade has a central projecting bay, with a group of three archways at the entrance. Above is a group of three arched windows housed within a large round arched recess . Up several steps is a reception lobby with terrazzo floor, with small meeting rooms either side. Stairs to either side lead to further rooms upstairs. Through the three entrance doors with brass handles, is a large hall, of two-storey height. Centred is a dance floor. The hall area presently has a suspended ceiling and a mezzanine over its rear section. Along each side of the hall is an arched colonnaded aisle, with a mezzanine walkway to the perimeter. In some parts, there are large round- arched windows rising the two-storeys of the height. Below the stage is a basement with framed change cubicles.  Heritage listing  Holy Trinity Church Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 April 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Holy Trinity Church complex is a substantial brick complex which is important in demonstrating the growth and importance of Mackay associated with the sugar cane industry from 1864 to the present time. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Holy Trinity Church Complex comprises three buildings constructed at different times all with reference to and in sympathy with the distinctive Romanesque inspired design of the 1923 Church. The Complex is a landmark in Mackay and has aesthetic and architectural significance for its siting, planning, quality of detailing and other design qualities. The Church is of particular architectural quality, with well composed interiors and detailing, and has special associations with the architect Lange Powell, in illustrating the breadth of this work. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a long association with the Anglican community in Mackay. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The church demonstrates the spread of the Anglican Church in regional Queensland.

It is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust (BBOWT), with the assistance of the Friends of Letcombe Valley. The reserve was part of a manor formerly known as Benhams, which was purchased in 1851 by a racehorse owner called Thomas Parr. After the Second World War, the manor became a centre for scientific research, which was acquired in 1985 by a chemical company, Dow Elanco. The company created a nature reserve on land next to Letcombe Brook, and when the research centre closed in 2002 the main part of the site was developed for housing. BBOWT was given a fifty year lease on the nature reserve in 2010 as a condition of planning permission for the housing. Letcombe Brook, which runs through the reserve, is one of only two chalk streams in Oxfordshire and 161 nationwide. Wildlife includes water voles and fish such as bullhead, brown trout and the primitive brook lamprey. There are also Daubenton's bats, while insects include rare flies. Additional habitats are ancient woodland and a small area of chalk grassland. There is access from a bridleway at the top of South Street.

Early life and education She was born in Ekaterinoslav, Russia in 1903. She immigrated to the United States and studied under Hans Hofmann from 1946‚Äì7. Career During her career, she painted and also engaged in lithography and etching. She eventually founded the Gerardia Workshop, where she taught a variety of mediums. Gerardia was a member of the Vectors artist group. From 1967 until 1969, she was president of the American Society of Contemporary Artists. She exhibited her work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where her work was described as showing \\"good arrangement\\", and being \\"visually pleasing.\\" She was called an \\"industrous artist\\", by one critic. Later life and legacy She died in 1988. Work She was primarily a painter, and participated in the Abstract expressionist movement early in her career while studying under Hans Hofmann. In the early 1950s, she leaned more towards the Cubism movement. Gerardia used geometric shapes in much of her work and used the colors black and white primarily. She started incorporating more color into her paintings starting in 1959, including lavender, which renders heavily into her works of the early 1960s. She emphasized negative space frequently in her work, which was featured prominently due to her choice use of color.

She came to notice due to the efforts of her sister Margaret McMillan, who memorialised her life after her death. Margaret named the Rachel McMillan Nursery School and Children's Centre after her sister Rachel in 1917, the year of her death. Life McMillan was born in 1859 at Throggs Neck in New York state to Scottish emigrant parents. Her parents, James and Jane (born Cameron), had married the year before; they would have one other surviving daughter, Margaret. McMillan's father and an infant sister died in 1865 from scarlet fever, and their mother took the family back to Scotland. Rachel and Margaret were brought up in Inverness and attended the Inverness Academy. McMillan was there until she was fifteen, when she went to teach in Coventry for three years at a women's college. Rachel and Margaret McMillan plaque, Bromley She did not take paid employment until her grandmother died in 1877, when she went to London and ran a hostel for women. McMillan's growing understanding and support for socialism were used in a case study of growing public understanding of the writings of William Morris and Karl Marx, but her claim to fame arrived after her death in 1917. As early as 1887, however, she had been converted to Christian Socialism by listening to sermons by the Rev. John Glasse. Margaret renamed a nursery school which had been founded in 1914 the Rachel McMillan Nursery School.Rachel McMillan Open Air Nursery School, Lost Hospitals of London, Retrieved 1 January 2015 McMillan's reputation as a convert relies on a valedictory biography written about her by her sister in 1927. Margaret had been nursed through a severe illness by Rachel. Rachel and Margaret had lived together at lodgings at 51 Tweedy Road in Bromley, and there they entertained well-known people including Prince Kropotkin, the Lansburys, Margaret Llewelyn Davies, and the Countess of Warwick. In 2009 English Heritage had a blue plaque placed on this house in Bromley to record Margaret and Rachel lodging there.Rachel and Maraget McMillan, English Heritage, Retrieved 20 December 2015 Margaret created the Rachel McMillan Training College in 1930. She not only named the college after her sister, but also ascribed the innovations in teaching there to McMillan. The biography that she wrote for her sister describes her as having an ideal childhood and being a leader in the development of child care and teacher training.

The Guardian ranked Invisibilia among \\"the 10 best new podcasts of 2015.\\" Background Alix Spiegel was a founding producer of This American Life and freelanced for NPR's Science Desk covering psychology and human behavior. At Chicago's Third Coast International Audio Festival, Spiegel met former Radiolab producer Lulu Miller and asked her to co-produce a piece she was working on. The two began collaborating on radio stories and conceived of a new long-form program that would become Invisibilia. The show's first six-episode season aired from January to February 2015, with excerpts occasionally running on All Things Considered, Morning Edition, Radiolab and This American Life. This extra exposure and Miller and Spiegel's track record helped Invisibilia debut at #1 on the iTunes podcast chart and to maintain a consistent top-ten ranking in the months following its launch. Hanna Rosin from The Atlantic joined as cohost for the second season, which premiered in June 2016 and ran for seven episodes. The third season debuted in June 2017 with Spiegel and Rosin as hosts.

He was a Professor of Law at the University of Aberdeen, and served from 1912 to 1918 as the first chairman of the Scottish Land Court.  Early life and education  Kennedy was born in 1854 at Rosehall in Sutherland, the son of Rev John Downie Kennedy (1811-1873) and his wife Catherine Mackay.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church His father had been minister of Rosehall for the Church of Scotland since 1836 but at the Disruption of 1843 joined the Free Church of Scotland. Neil was educated at Inverness and then at the University of Aberdeen, where he was awarded an MA in 1876. He later received an LL.D from the University of Edinburgh, in 1903.  Career  He was called to the Scottish Bar in 1874 or 1877, and in 1898 he was appointed as lecturer on private international law at the University of Edinburgh. From 1901 to 1907 he was Professor of Civil and Scots Law at the University of Aberdeen. His interest in the plight of crofters led him to be the Liberal Party candidate for Inverness-shire at the 1895 general election. He achieved a swing of 4.8% from the Conservatives, but fell 100 votes short of defeating the sitting Conservative MP James Evan Bruce Baillie. He was a member of the Congested Districts Board, and in May 1906 he was appointed to the Royal Commission On Registration Of Title In Scotland. Kennedy became a King's Counsel in October 1906. In January 1907, he became Sheriff of Renfrew and Bute. In April 1908 he was appointed as a chairman of the Crofters' Commission, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Sir David Brand. = Land Court = In March 1912, Kennedy was appointed as the first chairman of the Scottish Land Court, with the rank of a Lord of Session and the judicial title of Lord Kennedy. The Land Court was established under the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911. Some of its duties had been transferred from the Crofters Commission. The court regarded with great suspicion by landowners, because the 1911 Act had extended of security of tenure to tenant farmers in all of Scotland. This right had previously existed only in the seven crofting counties of Shetland, Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire and Argyll, where it was created by the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886. The landowners' hostility was reflected in the newspapers. In 1914 The Scotsman called it \\"the new tyrants of the countryside\\", and Blackwood's Magazine labelled it as the \\"Agrarian Star Chamber\\". The Court was also criticised by the Court of Session when it heard appeals, reproaching Kennedy's \\"rhetorical indulgence\\". In March 1914, the Conservative MP John Pretyman Newman was rebuked by the Speaker for asking in the House of Commons \\"Does Lord Kennedy act in his judicial capacity, or is he merely a tool of the Radical party?\\"  Personal life  Ainslie Place in Edinburgh In April 1902, Kennedy married his cousin Hilda Stevenson at St Mary's Church, Hendon in Middlesex.  Death  Kennedy died on 12 February 1918, at his home at 22 Ainslie Place on the Moray Estate in west Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1911 He was 63 years old.

It was released in 2015. Though the rules of Boon are analogous to those in the game Sheepshead, Boon uses a specialized deck which corresponds directly to the rules of the game. This is different than Sheepshead, which is played with 32 cards from the Standard 52-card deck. Boon can be played with three or four players. Objective To win the game, you must be the player with the most victory cards by the time another player is eliminated. Each game is played in a successive series of rounds, after which victory cards are exchanged.  Cards  There are 32 gameplay cards that come in four suits, as denoted by their color (blue, green, red, and gold). In total, there are: * 6 blue cards (ranks 1 - 6) * 6 green cards (ranks 1 - 6) * 6 red cards (ranks 1 - 6) * 14 gold Trump cards (ranks 1 - 14) Each card has its rank in the corner and its given point value marked in the center. Points range from 0 - 11. Note that there's not a direct correlation between rank and points - the highest ranked cards in the game are not worth the most points. In addition to gameplay cards, there are also 20 Victory Cards in the deck.  Game Setup  At the start of the game, separate the victory cards from the gameplay cards. Provide each player with 5 Victory Cards.  Dealing the Cards  At the start of a round, deal out all the remaining gameplay cards face down as follows: For 3-Player Games: * First remove the \\"Green 1\\" and \\"Red 1\\" cards from the deck. Then deal nine cards to each player and put another three cards in a separate pile called the Boon. For 4-Player Games: * Deal seven cards to each player and put another four cards in a separate pile called the Boon. After each round, the dealer role shifts to the next clockwise player.  What is the Boon?  The Boon is a pile of cards a player may use to gain an advantage and improve his hand. When a player takes the Boon, he becomes a solo player against every- one else. For the rest of the round, all other players are united on a defensive team against the solo player who took the Boon.  Taking the Boon  After the cards are dealt, the player to the left of the dealer has the choice to take the Boon and use its cards. Note that you don't get to see the cards in the Boon until after you've decided to take it. If the player takes the Boon, he then chooses 3 cards (for 3-player mode) or 4 cards (for 4-player mode) to put face down into his points pile. These points count toward his score at the end of the round. Now all of the other players are on a defensive team against the solo player who took the Boon. If a player chooses not to take the Boon, the opportunity passes to the next clockwise player who now has the same opportunity. This keeps repeating for all players until either someone takes the Boon or all players pass on it. If nobody takes the Boon, the game goes into Leaster Mode.  Playing a Trick  The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick in a round by playing any card from his hand. The suit of the card played is called the leading suit for the remainder of the trick. Proceeding clockwise, each player plays a card face up in the middle of the table. Each player must follow suit, which means: * If a player has one or more cards of the leading suit, he must play one of them. * If a player does not have any cards of the leading suit, he can play any card in his hand.  Winning a Trick  The trick ends after each player has played one card. The winner of the trick is: * The person who played the highest ranked trump card if any trump cards are present. * The person who played the highest ranked card of the leading suit if no trump cards are present. The winner of the trick collects the cards played into a personal face down pile and proceeds to play the first card of the next trick. Tricks repeat until all players are out of cards, completing a round.  Winning a Round  The round is over when all of the cards have been played. The two opposing sides ‚Äì the solo player and the defensive team ‚Äì are competing to win the most points out of the round‚Äôs 120 total possible points. At the end of the round, each player adds up the point values on the cards he won ‚Äì his personal face down pile. The solo player also adds the points from the cards he removed from his hand at the start of the round. The defensive team adds their points together, then payouts are determined by the solo player‚Äôs score: * If the solo player scores 0 - 29 points, he pays each defensive player 2 victory cards. * If the solo player scores 30 - 60 points, he pays each defensive player 1 victory card. * If the solo player scores 61 - 90 points, he collects 1 victory card from each defensive player. * If the solo player scores 91 - 120 points, he collects 2 victory cards from each defensive player.  Winning the Game  Rounds repeat until one player has lost all of his victory cards after payouts. You win the game if you are the player who has the most victory cards at this time!  Leaster Mode  If all players decline to take the Boon, the round goes into Leaster Mode. Set the Boon cards aside entirely. Each player is on a team of his own. The goal is now to earn the fewest points possible, while still winning at least one trick. A player who does not win any tricks is disqualified from winning the round. At the end of the round, each player gives one victory card to the winner.

Description and history The Rock River is an east-flowing tributary of the West River in southeastern Vermont. It runs across southern Newfane, where the village of South Newfane is located roughly midway across the width of the town. The South Newfane Bridge spans the river in a north-south direction, connecting Dover Road on the south side to Deer Hill Road, Chapin Road, and Parish Hill Road on the north side. The bridge is a single span metal Pratt through truss, long, with a roadway width of and a portal clearance of . The bridge is set on concrete abutments. The trusses are built primarily out of steel I-beams, which have been fastened together using bolts. A truss system supports a wooden road bed, and guard rails are bolted to the trusses. The bridge was built in 1939, following flooding that washed away the previous bridge at the site. It was funded from a combination of local, state, and federal sources, including Works Progress Administration funds. The use of I-beams in its construction marked an evolution in bridge construction after the state's devastating 1927 floods: the I-beams were less expensive, but added weight to the structure over earlier materials.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1933. It is also known as Mackay Intermediate School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000.  History  The Mackay Central State School, the second to be built on the site, was constructed in 1933 to a design from the Office of Public Works. In search of new pastoral land, John Mackay and his party entered and named the valley of the Mackay River in 1860 (renamed Pioneer River in 1862), and the following year he returned to establish a cattle station. In 1862, the ketch \\"Presto\\" entered the Mackay River landing stores and building materials, then surveyed the river mouth, which consequently was gazetted as a Port of Entry. The first settlers arrived in October 1862, establishing the settlement of Port Mackay on the south bank of the river. By the end of 1863, the name of the river had been changed to the Pioneer River, the first survey of the town of Mackay had been made, and the first land sale of town lots had been held. The town of Mackay soon began to prosper through the growth of the port, the nearby pastoral holdings, and the plantations along the river which included the beginnings of the local sugar industry. River Street developed as a busy waterfront precinct with wharves (the Government wharf opened in 1868), warehouses, offices, ships' chandleries, boat builders, hotels and boarding houses, and the Customs complex which by 1870 included the Customs House, the bond store and the Sub Collectors residence. The first school on the site, on which the Mackay Central State School was to be built, was opened on 14 September 1871 with 41 pupils. In 1885, when student numbers reached 650, the boys and girls were separated. The boys school remained on the original site, while the girls moved to a site across the road (now the Mackay Entertainment Centre). In 1933, the schools were reunited at the girls' school site. The present school was constructed in 1933 as the Mackay Intermediate School. In 1928, Intermediate Schools were established to provide vocational training for senior primary school students. At the completion of Grade five, children wishing to have vocational training were sent to the district's intermediate school where they followed the curriculum of sixth and seventh grades as well as compulsory vocational subjects. This policy also avoided the duplication of vocational training equipment at all primary schools. Intermediate Schools were similar in room size and plan form to existing high schools. By 1937, there were Intermediate Schools in Brisbane North (1935), Brisbane South (1929), Bundaberg (1933), Charters Towers (1929), Gatton (1933), Gympie (1933), Mackay, Maryborough Girls and Boys (1936), Mount Morgan (1929), Roma, Warwick (1929) and Ayr (1937). Designed by the Department of Public Works, the school is architecturally typical of the style of brick schools constructed during the 1930s. Brick schools were popular with architects as they were considered permanent, relatively inexpensive to maintain and labour-intensive. It is partly for the latter reason that thirty brick schools were constructed in Queensland during the 1930s Depression, providing considerable employment relief. Typically, these schools were multi-storeyed, unlike the predominant single storey, timber school buildings. They were symmetrical in plan and usually exhibited classical style elements and featured a prominent central entry. Based on this plan, the Mackay Central State School was constructed as a purpose-built Intermediate School. The foundation stone of the Mackay Intermediate School was laid by the Queensland Premier and local MLA, William Forgan Smith, on 22 July 1933. The school catered for 600 male and female pupils and comprised fourteen classrooms, domestic science rooms in the eastern wing and manual science rooms in the western wing. Like similarly constructed schools, the classrooms in the Mackay Intermediate School were divided by folding timber partitions. On completion of the building, the primary schools students moved to their new school and the Girls' School became the Infants School. Students attended the Infant School from grades 1 to 5, then the Intermediate School from which they could graduate to Mackay High School. In 1967, the Infant and Intermediate Schools combined and became the Mackay Central State School. The building was extended, with a wing constructed at the rear of the building, to provide for the increased numbers of students. The extensions provided an additional three classrooms. Other buildings later constructed on the site include the pre-school and activities block. Since 2014, the Queensland state education system converted to primary schools teaching Preparatory to 6th year with 7th to 12th year in the secondary. In 2014, as a P-6 school, Mackay Central State had an enrolment of 201 students with 14 teachers (12 full-time equivalent).  Description  Central entrance, 2009 The Mackay Central State School is a two-storey brick and stucco building with three projecting gable bays. Its roof is clad with corrugated iron. Between each bay the main facade is recessed. There is a single storey level section at each end with a hipped roof. The central entrance comprises a porch of three archways with a half-timbered ceiling. On the roof is an octagonal fleche which has a copper cupola roof and louvred arcading around the sides. All external windows, many original, are multi- panelled casements. The internal windows are multi-panelled sash windows with hopper ventilating top lights. Paired entry doors have four pane glazed top panels set over singular rectangular panels with deep moulded borders. Internal doors are similar, but constructed of timber only. The school is symmetrical in design. The ground level comprised six classrooms, a teachers room and a passageway. A stove recess is still evident in the domestic science classroom in the eastern wing. There are eight class rooms on the upper floor and three of these can still be subdivided by the original folding partitions. The upstairs ceilings are half timbered and original air vents are extant throughout the building. Bathroom facilities are located at each end of both floors. The main building is reasonably intact and the original configuration of the building has been retained. The southern and western boundary of the school grounds are planted with mature Banyan figs (Ficus benghalensis). The grounds also include mature mango trees.  Heritage listing  Mackay Central State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1933, as a former Intermediate School, the Mackay Central State School is most significant in demonstrating the results of an important development in Queensland education, established in 1928, where schools provided vocational training for senior primary school student. Evidence of a practical approach can be still seen in the extant stove recess in the domestic science room in the eastern wing of the school. Mackay Central State School is demonstrative of a government scheme, the Unemployment Relief Scheme, implemented to assist the unemployed throughout Queensland, by means of generating work projects, during the Depression of the 1930s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Further, the Mackay Central State School, is significant as one of the best examples of a purpose-built Intermediate School, the purpose for its use being clearly expressed in the fabric of the building, with the domestic science section located in the eastern wing and the manual arts section located in the western wing. Constructed in 1933, the school is a good example of the types of brick schools constructed in Queensland during an era of substantial building activity. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is a fine example of a two-storeyed Inter-war brick school. Due to its massing and scale, the building is a landmark in the streetscape, in keeping with the Queensland Government's 1930s policy to raise the educational status of primary education through the construction of well designed, imposing buildings. Further, the mature boundary plantings, including Banyan figs (Ficus benghalensis) contribute to the aesthetic significance of the site. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The grounds on which the Mackay Central State School is built has been the site of public education for over a century, and consequently, is significant for its strong association with the local community.

Description Eremophila conferta is a shrub which usually grows to high with many tangled, dark brown branches which are often hidden, especially near their ends, by the leaves. The branches are covered with a layer of long, branched hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, densely crowded and are covered with soft grey hairs. They are also elliptic to egg-shaped, mostly long, wide and have a distinct mid-vein on their lower surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on stalks long. There are 5 narrow, lance-shaped sepals, long which have a felt- like texture due to a covering of long, soft hairs. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple, blue or lilac-coloured and white inside, with faint purple spots and is mostly glabrous. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs mostly from August to September and is followed by fruits which are oval- shaped, yellow-brown with a papery covering and are about long.E. conferta leaves and flowers Taxonomy and naming Eremophila conferta was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock about west of the Mount Augustus homestead on the lower slopes of Mount Augustus. The specific epithet (conferta) is a Latin word meaning \\"crowded\\" referring to the leaves of this species.

Safra) campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Jerusalem, Israel housing the personal papers of 20th century physicist Albert Einstein. Overview Einstein's matriculation grades in 1896 In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them. The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items. In March 2012, the University announced that it had digitized the archive and was planning to make it more accessible online. The archive initially released 2,000 documents. Within the collection are his personal notes, love letters to various women, including the woman who would become his second wife, Elsa. Also to be included in the online collection is a letter to the Arabic newspaper Falastin, proposing a \\"Secret Council\\" composed of Arabs and Jews to resolve the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. History First page from the manuscript explaining the theory of general relativity by Albert Einstein (1915‚Äì16). Albert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days, giving the first lecture at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem‚Äîtwo years before the University opened in 1925. Menachem Ussishkin, the president of the Zionist Executive, invited Einstein to settle in Jerusalem, but this was the only visit that Einstein actually made to Jerusalem. However, Einstein was a member of the university's first board of governors. In 1925, the original 46-page manuscript of the general theory of relativity ended up at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Einstein did not save all of his written material, but from 1919, as his fame increased, he employed his stepdaughter Ilse as a secretarial assistant. Helen Dukas (1896‚Äì1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, although not all outgoing correspondence was saved. After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser, aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in Berlin. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in Caputh, Brandenburg was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to Paris, and ended up stored in Princeton, New Jersey, United States until after Einstein's death. Einstein's 1950 will appointed Helen Dukas and Otto Nathan as trustees of the estate and stated, \\"[A]ll literary rights and assets shall be vested in the Hebrew University.\\" After Einstein's death in 1955, the trustees spent many years organizing Einstein's papers. In the 1960s, Helen Dukas and the physicist Gerald Holton of Harvard University in the USA reorganized the archive, with the aim of publishing the material, in a joint project between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Princeton University Press. The material increased from 14,000 documents at the time of Einstein's death in 1955 to around 42,000 documents in 1982. To aid in this work, Einstein's papers were transferred from his Princeton home to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. In 1982, the Einstein Estate transferred Einstein's personal papers to the Jewish National & University Library in Jerusalem. President Avraham Harman of The Hebrew University and Milton Handler of the American Friends of The Hebrew University worked on the transfer of the material to Jerusalem. In subsequent years, additional material was sent from Einstein's Princeton home. The Bern Dibner Curatorship, which manages the Albert Einstein Archives, was established in 1988 by the Dibner Fund of Connecticut, USA. U.S. Declaration of Intent, Albert Einstein The first curator of the Einstein Archives was Ze'ev Rosenkranz whose term extended from 1989 to 2003. The catalogue was made available online in 2003. Since 2004, Roni Grosz has been the head of the Archives. The Einstein Archives became part of the Hebrew University's Library Authority in January 2008. In July of that year, the Archives moved to the Levy Building on the Givat Ram campus. Since March 19, 2012, the Archives have digitized and made available increasingly more of Einstein's works online. Princeton University Press has also been active in this effort.

The ballad is about an attack upon two white families by Native Americans on August 25, 1746. The attack occurred in an area of Deerfield called \\"The Bars\\", which was a colonial term for a meadow. The poem was preserved orally until it was published in 1855 in Josiah Gilbert Holland's History of Western Massachusetts. It is considered the oldest known work of literature by an African AmericanMargaret Busby, Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, p. 16‚Äì17. and is the only known work by Lucy Terry.  Text of the ballad  The text of the ballad from Holland's History of Western Massachusetts, 1855: August 'twas the twenty-fifth, Seventeen hundred forty- six; The Indians did in ambush lay, Some very valient men to slay, The names of whom I'll not leave out. Samuel Allen like a hero fout, And though he was so brave and bold, His face no more shall we behold. Eleazer Hawks was killed outright, Before he had time to fight,‚Äî Before he did the Indians see, Was shot and killed immediately. Oliver Amsden he was slain, Which caused his friends much grief and pain. Simeon Amsden they found dead, Not many rods distant from his head. Adonijah Gillett we do hear Did lose his life which was so dear. John Sadler fled across the water, And thus escaped the dreadful slaughter. Eunice Allen see the Indians coming, And hopes to save herself by running, And had not her petticoats stopped her, The awful creatures had not catched her, Nor tommy hawked her on her head, And left her on the ground for dead. Young Samuel Allen, Oh lack-a-day! Was taken and carried to Canada. Rediscovery After its 1855 publication the poem was undiscovered until 1942, when it was published in Lorenzo Greene's The Negro in Colonial New England 1620‚Äì1776. Unfortunately, this youthful occasional poem is the only surviving work by Terry, who is known to have been a prolific poet. Since the poem resists analysis as a work of literature, recent scholarship has instead drawn attention to how Terry evokes her participation in the local community by recounting the names of the men and women who fought alongside her, and how the town responded by preserving the poem and her name in their oral histories.

He principally performed naturalistic and figurative images. Life and career Carl Johannes Andreas Adam D√∏rnberge was born at N√∏tter√∏y in Vestfold, Norway. He was the son of Johann Christopher D√∂rnberger from Nuremberg and Augusta Charlotte Wilhelmine Luise M√∂nch from Stralsund. His born German father worked as master brewer in T√∏nsberg. When he was eight years old the family traveled back to Germany, where he lived until became a student of David Arnesen (1818-1895) and Johan Jacob Bennetter (1822-1904) in Christiania (now Oslo) at the age of seventeen. In 1883 he traveled to Paris where he studied under several artists including William- Adolphe Bouguereau of Acad√©mie Julian. He debuted at the H√∏stutstillingen in 1887, and had his first solo exhibition in 1900. That same year he married Lina Gurine Berg Isachen, and they had a daughter, Gro Franciska D√∏rnberger (born 1904). D√∏rnberger had many famous artists in his circle, including Edvard Munch and Akseli Gallen-Kallela, who both painted portraits of him. Around 1896 he moved to the Norwegian port town of Son in Akershus where he lived for the remainder of his life in his home known as \\"D√∏rnbergerhuset\\". Many of D√∏rnberger's works are motifs from Son, including the historic buildings in the town center and the steamer jetty lying below his house. He remained largely naturalist while painting landscapes, portraits, figurative studies and nautical scenes. He was, for many, at least as well known for his eccentric lifestyle as for his art.

Location of Cilicia within the classical regions of Asia Minor/Anatolia Syennesis, also Syennesis III (, Aramaic:TRZ) was a ruler of ancient Cilicia in the 5th century BCE. Rule Synnesis was a contemporary of Artaxerxes II of Persia, and when Cyrus the Younger, marching against Artaxerxes in 401 BCE, arrived at the borders of Cilicia, he found the passes guarded by Syennesis, who, however, withdrew his troops on receiving intelligence that the force advanced by Cyrus under Meno had already entered Cilicia, and that the combined fleet of the Lacedaemonians and the prince, under Samius and Tamos, was sailing round from Ionia. When Cyrus reached Tarsus, the Cilician capital, he found that Meno's soldiers had sacked the city, and commanded Synnesis to appear before him. Syennesis had fled for refuge to a stronghold among the mountains, but he was induced by his wife, Epyaxa, to obey the summons of Cyrus. Here he received gifts of honor from the Cyrus, whom he supplied in his turn with a large sum of money and a considerable body of troops under the command of one of his sons. At the same time, however, Syennesis took care to send his other son to Artaxerxes, to represent his meeting with Cyrus as having been something he'd been forced to do, while his heart all the time was with the king, Artaxerxes. From Xenophon's telling it appears that Syennesis at this time, though really a vassal of Persia, affected the tone of an independent sovereign.Xenophon, Hellenica iii. 1. ¬ß IXenophon, Anabasis i. 2. ¬ß¬ß 12, 21-27, 4. ¬ß 4, vii. 8. ¬ß 25Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica xiv. 20 Coinage File:CILICIA, Tarsos.

He was a nobleman who worked as a court scribe in Vilnius for almost thirty years. In 1598, he published the first Lithuanian-language Protestant book in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This book, a bilingual catechism in Polish and Lithuanian, was published in response to the publication of the Roman Catholic catechism of Mikalojus Dauk≈°a. However, book's heavy, artificial language with numerous loanwords make it linguistically inferior to Dauk≈°a's work. Biography Petkeviƒçius was born to a wealthy family of Lithuanian nobles around 1550. According to the military census of 1528, his grandfather Grigas Petkeviƒçius had to send four men to the army in case of war. Petkeviƒçius' father Jonas had manors near Mai≈°iagala and Salakas. Orphaned as a teen, he was raised by his uncle Motiejus, cup-bearer of Lithuania, who had a manor in Panevƒó≈æiukas. Based on analysis of Petkeviƒçius language, linguist Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius determined that he grew up in that area. Petkeviƒçius knew several languages (Lithuanian, Latin, Polish, Chancery Slavonic) and held various offices: tax collector (1580), scribe of Vilnius Court (1581‚Äì1608), starosta of Raseiniai (before 1586‚Äì1599), secretary of the Lithuanian Tribunal when it met in Vilnius. He owned a house in Vilnius as well as several manors around Mai≈°iagala, Giedraiƒçiai, Salakas. He sponsored the construction of a Protestant church in Gliti≈°kƒós. He was married twice. Three sons from the first marriage became students of the Protestant University of K√∂nigsberg in 1596. His second wife was widowed Darata Jok≈´baitƒó Giedraitytƒó, cousin of Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis. In 1598, Petkeviƒçius established his own press in Vilnius specifically for the purpose of printing Protestant books. First he published a Polish book by on teachings of Paul the Apostle (a copy is kept by the National Library of Poland), and then he published bilingual catechism in Polish and Lithuanian. The press was very expensive to maintain and it is believed that Petkeviƒçius sold it to brothers Sultzeris. Petkeviƒçius was a member of the laity and he published religious texts on his own initiative. The first Lithuanian Protestant books published in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, unlike the Lithuanian Protestant books published in the Duchy of Prussia almost fifty years earlier, were a result of individual efforts of nobles and not of the clergymen or the synod. Petkeviƒçius died in Vilnius in early 1608 when the Lithuanian Tribunal was in session. Catechism =Publication history= The catechism is titled in Polish () and is a truncated version of the Polish catechism most likely prepared by Stanis≈Çaw Sudrowski and printed in Vilnius in 1595 (its title page is missing which makes it hard to determine its author or date of publication). In turn, Sudrowski's work drew from the Polish catechism sponsored by Miko≈Çaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and printed in Nesvizh in 1563. Petkeviƒçius' catechism was expanded and republished as Kniga Nobaznistes (1653). The catechism was found and published by Aleksander Br√ºckner in Archiv f√ºr slavische Philologie in 1891. A photocopied edition was prepared and published by Juozas Balƒçikonis in 1939. The copy was kept at a city library in Gda≈Ñsk, but it disappeared during World War II. After the war, a new copy was found in Gotha and is currently kept at the Gotha Research Library (). In 1970, linguist Jonas Kruopas published a dictionary of all words used in the catechism. =Content= The catechism of Petkeviƒçius is printed in Polish on the left and in Lithuanian on the right. Such format was likely intended to assist the clergymen, who were often Polish and knew little Lithuanian, in learning the Lithuanian language. The text also includes an 8-line poem urging the children to learn. As such, the book was likely intended for both audiences ‚Äì the clergy and the students. Each language contains 252 pages. The book starts with a Polish foreword which emphasizes the need of catechisms in local languages to reach the faithful but, unlike Mikalojus Dauk≈°a, does not advocate switching back from Polish to Lithuanian. In addition to basic catechism, the book includes prayers, 93 hymns, 40 psalms (one psalm translated twice), and Agenda. The hymns and psalms were taken from various previous publications. Five of the hymns were taken from the Catechism of Martynas Ma≈ævydas (1547). 27 of the psalms were taken from the Nesvizh catechism of 1563; two of them were translated to Polish by Miko≈Çaj Rej. Six other psalms were translated by Jan Kochanowski. The Lithuanian translation of the psalms attempted to keep the same number of syllables so that they could be sung to the same music. The Lithuanian translation is consistent and reflects the same Auk≈°taitian dialect as Dauk≈°a's work. However, the word-by-word translation from Polish led to stilled and artificial language full of loanwords (almost a quarter of vocabulary is loanwords). As such, it is of much lower linguistic quality and importance than works by Dauk≈°a. However, the prayers were not translated by Petkeviƒçius but taken from already existing translations. Thus their language is much more archaic and with much less loanwords. Linguist Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius determined that these translations date back to the 13th century when King Mindaugas converted to Christianity.

Contributions to Education Ong was the founder/pioneer of four schools in the Manjung district, namely, Chung Cheng Primary School in Sitiawan; Nan Hwa High School in Sitiawan; Ping Min Free School in Lumut; and Dindings High School in Lumut. These four schools are now renamed SJK (C) Chung Cheng, SMJK Nan Hwa, SJK (C) Ping Min and SMJK Dindings, respectively. In 1961, Nan Hwa High School was split into SMJK Nan Hwa, a public school and Nan Hwa Private High School.

He raised funds for the school. Fundraising brought Ong to towns in many parts of Malaya, to Singapore and Betong, Thailand. After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in December 1941, Ong continued going around Malaya collecting donations, visiting Betong, Grik, Lenggong, Kuala Kangsar, Taiping and Keroh to raise funds for the school. It is estimated that he approached and raised funds from more than 10,000 donors in more than 70 towns; some he visited on several occasions.Wang & Ong 2013, p.81 =Nan Hwa High School,Sitiawan= 1936_Founding of Nan Hwa High School (Ong, seated, 10th from left) Before 1935, there were four dialectic schools in Manjung District, each with its own junior high school section catering for their own clan - Chung Cheng for the Hokkien, Kuok Min for the Kutien, Uk Dih for the Hockchew (Fuzhou) and Min Teik for the Hockchia. In 1935, Ong and local community leaders launched a proposal to merge the junior high school section of the four schools to form a Junior and High School. The community leaders chose the name \\"Nan Hwa\\" to remind students that their ancestors migrated from China to settle in Nanyang. A meeting was convened in late 1935. At the meeting, Ong was elected the first Chairman of the School and Chairman/Secretary of the School Building Construction and Building Fundraising Committee.Nanyang Siang Pau. Kuala Lumpur, 9 December 1935, p.9Nanyang Siang Pau Kuala Lumpur, 28 May 1936, p.9 Efforts were then made to find a neutral venue.

Immediately after the Japanese Occupation, Ong was re-elected Chairman of the School Board in 1946 and 1947; and Chairman of the Building and Fundraising Committee. The immediate task was to restore/rebuild its premises and its facilities and amenities. Rev.T.C. Nga noted: \\"The task was gigantic then. In the midst of the then prevailing chaotic situation, some community leaders led by Mr Ong Seok Kim visited Nan Hwa High School, with the purpose of reopening the institution for classes to resume as soon as possible.

After a start-up period of seven months, the school was born with an opening ceremony held on 11 January 1954 at the school hall of Ping Min. Only two Junior Middle 1 (Form 1) classes were started at the beginning, with an enrolment of 60 students. Ong was elected the first Chairman of the School Board, serving between 1954 and 1958.http://www.youblisher.com/p/878679-SMJK-Dindings-17th-Magazine/, p.2 As Chairman of the School Board and in particular as Chairman of the School Fundraising Committee for nine years since the start of the school, Ong led a campaign to raise funds to upgrade and expand the school to accommodate senior middle classes. More than $200,000 was collected in donations from the local community and donors from over 70 towns located outside of Manjung District. In his diary, Ong recounted the fundraising activity as ‚Äúfull of painfully hard work‚Äù. He recorded that the School Fundraising Committee went through three fundraising trips to over 70 towns throughout Malaya and to Singapore to solicit for donations. From 8 September 1959 to 18 October 1960, a total of 213 days were spent in fundraising activities. With the donations, the school was upgraded with the construction of new classrooms, a library, and a school hall and the establishment of senior middle classes. The opening ceremony, and a fun fair, was held on 9 October 1960. Members of the Committee, led by Ong, had financed their own expenses in their trips out of town to solicit for donations. Their contributions were recognised through the construction of a plaque which was erected in the Lee Kong Chian School Hall and acknowledged in the School's 1961 Memorial Magazine, edited and published by Ong.Wang & Ong 2013, pp.101-108 =Other Schools= In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, Ong represented Chinese schools in the Manjung District in various activities and functions pertaining to Chinese education such as the training of Chinese school teachers and raising their employment conditions, in fundraising, and in meetings to raise academic standard and organizing and conducting sporting activities. Records of Khuen Hean Primary School [now known as SJK (C) Khuen Hean], Changkat Keruing, show that Ong made early donations to the school in 1936 for its upgrade, maintenance and purchase of school equipment. For his contribution, he was installed an honorary committee member of the School Board.SJK (C) Khuen Hean, Souvenir 75th Anniversary Magazine, 1932-2007. Changkat Kruing, Manjung, Perak, p.35 In 1936 and 1937, Ong made donations and played a role in helping Kuok Min Primary School [now known as SRJ (C) Kuok Min] in Sitiawan, to raise funds for its expansion and repair, purchase of school equipments and maintenance of school facilities and amenities. A total of $10,000 was raised in the fundraising campaign. In 1941, Ong was elected Vice-Chairman of the School Board, Pei Ching Primary School [now known as SJK (C) Pei Ching] in Beruas, Manjung District. In 1946, he founded Betong Primary School in Thailand where he had some rubber land. He was an adviser and an Inspector of the School. He was also Honorary Chairman of the School Board of Pei Min Primary School [now known as SJK (C) Pei Min] in Segari, and Eng Ling Primary School [now known as SJK (C) Eng Ling] in Lumut, all located in the Manjung District. He was a member of the School Board of Simpang Empat English School (aka Gandhi School) in Sitiawan for many years.Wang & Ong 2013, p.110 Personal life Ong had three wives, marrying the first in China and the other two in Malaya. As was the custom among Chinese of that era, he never divorced any of them. Together, they had 44 children, comprising 29 sons and 15 daughters, including five who were adopted.Wang & Ong 2013, pp.22-33 Awards and Passing 1964_Ong's funeral procession passing through Sitiawan Town Ong was appointed a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) in 1963 by the Sultan of Perak; and awarded the Kesatria Mangku Negara (KMN) by the King of Malaysia in 1964,Nanyang Siang Pau.

He died on May 31, 1964, approaching the age of 80. Ong is buried in the Sitiawan Chinese Cemetery, a cemetery he established, alongside his 2nd and 3rd wives. Legacy =Ong Seok Kim Memorial Education Fund= 1965_Ong Seok Kim Memorial Education Fund_Founding Committee After the death of Ong, local community leaders established the Ong Seok Kim Memorial Education Fund () in 1965 in his honour. The main objective of the Fund was to provide bursaries and scholarships to less fortunate local students to further their studies. Since its inception, the Fund has awarded financial assistance to thousands of students of different ethnicity from schools in the Manjung District. It had also provided financial assistance to students of Sitiawan in 1968 and Pangkor Island in 1983, who were victims of fire which destroyed their houses. In recent times, the Fund has extended its awards to students studying in tertiary institutions. =Ong Seok Kim Building, SJK(C) Ping Min, Lumut= In 2015, a new building for SJK (C) Ping Min is named after Ong.http://www.chinapress.com.my/?p=5099 References Sources =Books=Wang Jianshi, Ong Eng-Joo (2013): \\"No Other Way Out - A Biography of Ong Seok Kim\\".

The song is credited to Henry Creamer and Turner Layton, the writers of Sweet Emalina, My Gal and After You've Gone. Themes The song mostly focuses on the words, actions, and feelings of Dinah Lee, girlfriend of the eponymous soldier Alexander Cooper, as he marches to a troop ship to embark for France to fight in the war. Written by famous African-American songwriters Henry Creamer and Turner Layton, the song bucks the contemporary popular trend of minstrel songs and coon songs. Instead black soldiers are portrayed similarly to white ones, as heroes going off to war and leaving loved ones behind. Several lines echo themes common to many World War I popular songs: the longing of those at home for the return of the soldiers (\\"I'll be waiting like Poor Butterfly\\"); pride in the soldiers' service (\\"Dressed up in that uniform you fills my heart with joy\\"); and certainty in eventual victory (\\"So get busy with that gun and don't come back 'till you've won\\"). There's also tongue-in-cheek wordplay common to popular songs of the era (\\"You left that window open and they got you in the draft\\"). Lyrics The song starts off by setting a patriotic scene as a black regiment marches off to war, referencing emancipation to highlight the significance of the troops being African-American. :Alexander Cooper was a colored trooper :with his regiment he marched away :Bands were gaily playing, colored folks were swaying :on Emancipation Day. The two verses describe Dinah Lee's reaction to her boyfriend's presence among the troops, with the chorus being sung in her voice. :Goodbye Alexander, goodbye honey boy :Dressed up in that uniform, you fills my heart with joy :Alexander Cooper was a colored trooper :You ain't born for mopin', boy you sure can laugh :But you left that window open and they got you in the draft. :Alexander, I'll save my lovin' for you :I'll be waiting like Poor Butterfly Recordings The song was recorded by different artists and a number of variations found their way into these recordings. Marion Harris recorded a version for Victor Records that included a lengthy monologue while a version recorded by Ada Jones for Edison Records dispensed with this. Wilbur Sweatman's Original Jazz Band and the Farber Sisters also recorded the song for Columbia Records.

After joining the faculty at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 1978 and establishing his own laboratory, he focused his research on DNA recombination. He became chair of the Charles A. Dana Division of Human Cancer Genetics in 1995. He joined the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, San Diego Branch in 1997. Kolodner has made fundamental contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms of genetic recombination, DNA mismatch repair and the pathways that prevent genome instability. While studying DNA repair in bacteria and yeast, Kolodner identified two DNA mismatch repair genes, MSH2 and MLH1, that lead to 95 percent of hereditary colon cancer cases. In both cases, Kolodner reported his findings simultaneously with Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University. Kolodner also discovered that epigenetic silencing of MLH1 is the cause of much more common sporadic mismatch repair defective cancers. Kolodner was the Director of Ludwig Cancer Research San Diego Branch, and he is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the UC San Diego School of Medicine. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2000. He has also been elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the National Academy of Medicine. He is a past recipient of the Charles S. Mott Prize for Outstanding Research in Cancer Causation or Prevention, awarded by the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation and the Kirk A. Landon-AACR Prize in Basic Cancer Research. Kolodner was one of six UCSD faculty members to sue the institution over a planned reduction in funding to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.
