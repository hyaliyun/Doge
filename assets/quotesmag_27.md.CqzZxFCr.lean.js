It has no leaves but an insect-like flower which has its labellum dangling like a lure away from the rest of the flower. Because of its thin, wiry stem and small, dull-coloured flowers, this orchid is difficult to locate. Like others in the genus, the flowers are pollinated by a species of thynnid wasp. Some authorities use the name Thynninorchis huntiana for this orchid. Description Arthrochilus huntianus is a leafless terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. Up to ten insect-like flowers long and about wide are borne on a thin, wiry, green to reddish flowering stem tall. There are two, three or four bracts at the base of the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal and petals are long about wide and the lateral sepals are long and about wide. The sepals and petals all turn downwards towards the ovary. The labellum is long about wide on a thin stalk or \\"claw\\" long. The labellum callus is insect-like and consists of a shiny black \\"head\\" with two antenna-like structures, a \\"thorax\\" with long purplish or reddish hairs and a pair of long branched tails with tiny bristles. There are two pairs of curved wings on the column. Flowering occurs from November to March. Taxonomy and naming The common elbow orchid was first formally described in 1889 by Ferdinand von Mueller and given the name Drakaea huntiana. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected \\"between loose stones on Mount Tingiringi\\". In 1972 Donald Blaxell changed the name to Arthrochilus huntianus and in 2002 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Thynninorchis huntiana but the latter name has not been universally accepted. The specific epithet (huntianus) honours \\"Robt. Hunt, Esq. C.M.G., F.G.S., Master of the Sydney-Mint and Vice-President of the Committee of the Technological Museum\\" who discovered this species. In 1998 David Jones described two subspecies of A. huntianus: * Arthrochilus huntianus subsp. huntianus which occurs on continental Australia and formerly on Flinders Island; * Arthrochilus huntianus subsp. nothofagicola which grows in dense rainforest with Nothofagus cunninghamii which has a smaller labellum callus and is probably self-pollinating. In 2002 David Jones and Mark Clements raised the subspecies nothofagicola to species status as Thynninorchis nothofagicola but the name has not been accepted by some authorities. The two subspecies of Arthrochilus huntianus differ from other orchids in the genus by being leafless and having the labellum dangling with an insect-like \\"lure\\" on the end. Arthrochilus huntianus subsp. nothofagicola, as Thynninorchis nothofagicola, is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The species (or subspecies) is only known from a single site and is threatened by the activities of the introduced superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), by fire, forestry activities and climate change. Distribution and habitat Arthrochilus huntianus grows in woodland and forest, usually in leaf litter. In New South Wales it mainly grows on the Great Dividing Range south from the Blue Mountains and is widespread in eastern Victoria. It formerly occurred on Flinders Island in Tasmania but is now regarded as extinct there. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. huntianus is pollinated by males thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

She is known for her research into early Christianity, its relationship to the Roman Empire, and modern feminist interpretation.  Education and Career  In 1988, Melanie Johnson-DeBaufre earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Eastern College. She then went on to receive her Master of Divinity (M.Div) in 1992 and her Doctor of Theology (Th.D) in 2002 from Harvard Divinity School. Johnson-DeBaufre worked as an Assistant Professor of the Department of Religion and Philosophy at Luther College from 2000-2004. Starting in 2005, she continued her career as an Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Assistant Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at the Drew Theological School and the Graduate Division of Religion.  Research and Major publications  The major works of Johnson-DeBaufre are primarily feminist interpretation and analysis of the earliest Christianities. Her feminist approach to religious historiography has allowed her to explore ancient texts and cultures from previously unknown angles. = Walk in the Ways of Wisdom: Essays in Honor of Elisabeth Sch√ºssler Fiorenza = Johnson- DeBaufre co-edited this compilation of essays focusing on feminist theological research and interpretation. Written to honor Fiorenza's sixty-fifth birthday, the book is composed of essays written by students who studied under her and that focus on topics connected to Fiorenza's own research. = Jesus Among Her Children: Q, Eschatology, and the Construction of Christian Origins = In this major work, published by Harvard University Press, she analyzes theologians‚Äô current knowledge of Q and its impact on modern theology. Furthermore, she questions whether Jesus is an apocalyptic prophet or a wisdom sage in the original work, and frequently connects her questions to the feminine concept of wisdom. = Mary Magdalene Understood = This novel is Johnson-DeBaufre's layman's translation of Jane Schaberg's The Resurrection of Mary Magdalene. Johnson-DeBaufre provides Shaberg's original ideas, condenses and simplifies her research and interpretation of Mary Magdalene, while also inserting her own insights about the figure of Mary Magdalene. Multiple sources on Mary Magdalene are explored including the ancient texts, both canon and apocryphal, and several popular culture renditions such as The Da Vinci Code and Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on April 25, 2018. Plot Marilyn and Norm locate both Gennadi and Sofia, who are living separately, by following Stan. Sofia tells Stan that she and her son Ilya want to be reunited with Gennadi. Claudia and Elizabeth tell Paige about World War II from a Russian perspective. Using a surveillance picture taken by Paige, Claudia identifies a CIA officer from the Soviet Division meeting with Nesterenko, along with a high level staffer from senator Sam Nunn's office. Elizabeth sleeps with Philip and, in the morning, asks him to go to Greece with Kimmy and take her to Bulgaria, where she will be arrested with (planted) drugs (in more of a kidnapping) to blackmail her father about Nesterenko. Elizabeth approaches Gennadi on his way back to his safe house, but just as she reaches him, his bodyguard shows up, and she walks away. Stan suggests to Renee that she could work in the FBI personnel office. At a campus bar, Paige meets a boy who tries to pick her up, until his rude friend starts insulting her. When she starts to leave, the rude friend grabs her, and she beats him up, then punches the first boy in the nose when he follows her. \\"Jim\\" (Philip) meets Kimmy in Ann Arbor, but she is not enthusiastic about meeting him in Greece. To change her opinion, \\"Jim\\" and Kimmy make love. \\"Stephanie\\" gets another art lesson from Erica. Tatiana locates Oleg at class and blames him for William's capture in 1984, which cost her a promotion and stalled her career. She then has the new KGB rezident notify the Center that Oleg is in the U.S. and is not loyal. Paige comes over to her parents' house for a sparring session and tells them both about the bar fight and Brian. Elizabeth tells Philip that Paige may not be cut out for spying; Philip states that she can do it but should not. Philip visits Paige's apartment to discuss the bar fight. Paige states that she is not like Philip, that she believes in the cause. He challenges her to spar and gets her in a chokehold she cannot break, releasing her just before suffocation. Elizabeth climbs the fire escape to break into Gennadi's and unexpectedly finds Sofia there visiting; she kills both Gennadi and Sofia, leaving 7-year-old Ilya alive. Claudia and Elizabeth teach Paige to drink olive oil first to be able to consume more alcohol, and then they all test their drinking capacity by getting drunk on vodka. Over a beer, a crushed Stan tells Philip about the murdered couple and their orphaned son, who found his parents covered in blood. After Stan leaves, Philip calls Kimmy to cancel \\"Jim's\\" trip to Greece and to break up with her, and then tells her not to visit any communist country while in Europe. Production The episode was written by Hilary Bettis and directed by Thomas Schlamme. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Great Patriotic War\\" was seen by an estimated 538,000 household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. It has the lowest viewership of any episode in the series. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the episode 100% \\"Fresh\\" ratings and average rating of 9.42 out of 10, based on 10 reviews, with consensus reading, The Great Patriotic War' is taut and purposefully paced with glimmers of humor, heart, and heightened stakes for a good majority of The Americans' cast of characters.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade. Alan Sepinwall from Uproxx praised the episode as well, saying, \\"The final season to this point had been slow-playing the plot to a degree, but with 'The Great Patriot[ic] War'‚Äîthe rare super-sized drama episode that earns every extra minute, and never feels padded or self- indulgent, thanks to a marvelous and weighty script by Hilary Bettis and the usual precise direction from the great Tommy Schlamme‚Äîit's clear the endgame is now in full swing, and things can only get uglier from here.\\"  References  External links * Category:The Americans (season 6) episodes Category:2018 American television episodes ","title":"The Great Patriotic War (The Americans)"},{"id":"57239477","text":"Pselaptrichus is a genus of ant-loving beetles in the family Staphylinidae.

Riders spins in a circular rotation while swinging in an angle. The ride opened to the general public on April 21, 2017 in the Fiesta Village section of the park. Designed by Mondial, Sol Spin is a tipsy top turvy adventure taking places 6 stories high over Fiesta Village. As the ride lifts off the ground, riders begin spinning in a circular motion while guests are spun around. At its peak, Sol Spin rotates guests in circular motion at 60 feet in the air. Riders can experience up to 4gs at the peak of the ride. In addition, the ride is located on the former spot of Windseeker which was also built by Mondial. Sol Spin is unique as it is the largest Mondial Top Scan to this day. Knott's Sol Spin was customized to fit in the former location of Windseeker. Sol Spin is a customized Top Span Ride. Sol Spin At Knott's Berry Farm Height Requirement Sol Spin has a minimum guest requirement of 54 inches. It is one of the park's several thrill rides. The ride is rated as aggressive thrill due to a high thrilling and intense experience.. Riders of extreme sizes cannot ride due to the ride's seat design. Each is accompanied by a tight over the shoulder restraint and a seat belt as a secondary safety measure. Experience Located right in the Fiesta Village of the park, guests enter a large circular area surrounded by palms and flowers. As guests enter, the ride attendant instructs which free rotating gondola is available. Mondial's Top Scan typically only seat a maximum of 5 guests per gondola. However, Knott's was able to add an extra seat to each arm, extending the number of riders from 5 to 6.. This customized design increased the capacity of the ride from 30 riders per cycle to 36. Currently, no other Top Scans in operating seat more than 5 guests per rotating gondola. Mondial was able to customize the ride for added capacity due to Knott's frequent high crowds. Moreover, Riders select any set from the 6 rotating arms. Each rotating arm holds 6 guests. Riders are the instructed to place the over the shoulder restraints. As the ride begins operation, all 6 rotating arms begin spinning in a circular motion while gaining speed and height. At the same time, the arms begin rotating at an angle and causes rides to spin size stories high. At the peak of the ride, riders are invented a couple of times during the spinning cycle. Furthermore, one agreed criticism by some park visitors is the short cycle of the ride. In comparison to the Top Scan in European parks, Sol Spin has a short to mild operating cycle despite offering a aggressive and thrilling experience.

He is best known for depicting scenes of impressionistic landscapes and scenes of Philippine folk festivals and religious imagery in his art. In recent years, he has written and been involved with Philippine gastronomy both as renowned chef and as food writer with his weekly column, Turo-Turo (Filipino for pinpoint) on The Philippine Star. A scion of the Tayag family of Pampanga, he is the son of author and journalist, Renato D. Tayag. Biography and career Tayag was born in Angeles in the province of Pampanga on 7 August 1956 to Renato \\"Katoks\\" D. Tayag, a journalist for the Manila Times; and Adoracion Suarez. Tayag married Mary Ann Quioc, a former flight attendant and trainer of Cathay Pacific and have a son Victor Nicolo. Tayag graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics at the University of the Philippines Diliman, but also undertook several courses in architecture at the same time. From the circle of friends cultivated by his father, Tayag was surrounded by the noted personalities in the Philippine arts and letters including Emilio Aguilar Cruz, Sofronio Mendoza (SYM), Romulo Galicano, Adrian Cristobal Cruz and Ibarra dela Rosa who will later be collectively known as the Dimasalang Group. His encountering with Aguilar Cruz and others, spawned his oeuvre of painting in plein air leading to his first one-man exhibition at ABC Galleries in Manila in 1978 on his acrylic and watercolor landscapes. Consequently, in 1979, Tayag encountered the works of French-based Philippine painter Macario Vitalis while doing his travels on an eleven-month travel around Europe. Tayag and Vitalis became acquainted with each and whom he frequently visited in his residence in Plestin-les-Gr√®ves in Brittany. Subsequently, his paintings revolved on themes ranging from the local festivals in particular the Moriones and the Ati- atihan, Philippine folk religious imagery (better known as santos), landscapes of the Cordillera region and a travelogue of sceneries in Europe and Japan from 1979 to 1980. By 1990, Tayag delved towards woodwork and sculpture by forming sculptures delving in waves and abstractions by means of wood lamination. His sculptures and his wood furniture are mainly reminiscent of the works of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Alexander Calder. In 1989, after receiving a grant from the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), Tayag made a large-scale black and white sumi painting known as Black Mountain which was later mounted in the lobby of the Little Theater of the CCP. The painting however was destroyed in a fire in the late 1990s. Tayag has actively participated in several one-man and group exhibitions in the Philippines, China, the United States, and Spain, where he exhibited with both Filipino, Southeast Asian and Spanish artists. In 2003, he held a three-man show with Ben Cabrera and Patis Tesoro in a museum in his hometown, Angeles. Other Filipino artists who exhibited in group shows with him include Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, Phyllis Zaballero, Soler Santos, Abdulmari Imao, and Sajid Imao. Tayag also participated in the 20th Asian International Art Exhibition at the Ayala Museum in 2005. In 2011, alongside with co-curator Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, Tayag curated the retrospective of the early works of French- based Philippine painter Vitalis at the Total Gallery space of the Alliance Fran√ßaise de Manille in Makati City from 1 to 31 March 2011. = Public collections = Tayag's work is displayed in numerous public and private collections, including: * Bank of the Philippine Islands Collection (BPI) * Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Collection (BSP) * Metropolitan Museum of Manila * Paulino and Hetty Que Collection * Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company Collection (PLDT) Bibliography * Imahen: A Folio of Philippine Folk Santos (1989) * Food Tour: A Culinary Journal (2006) * Kulinarya: A Guidebook to Philippine Cuisine (2008; as co-author) * Linamnam: Eating One's Way Around the Philippines (2014) References  External links  * Official Website of Claude Tayag Category:1956 births Category:Artists from Pampanga Category:People from Angeles, Philippines Category:Filipino sculptors Category:20th-century Filipino painters Category:20th-century Filipino sculptors Category:21st-century Filipino sculptors Category:Kapampangan people Category:Living people ","title":"Claude Tayag"},{"id":"57239830","text":"Lecontella is a genus of checkered beetles in the family Cleridae.

Distribution and Habitat The distribution of the Angeles striped-sweat bee is limited to North America. They have been found as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico. They are most commonly found in the western and central US, in and around the desert regions of the southwestern US. Behavior Sweat bees get their name due to their attraction to human sweat. They often land on humans and lick sweat from the skin for the salt content. Males seem less likely to exhibit this behavior. They are polylectic pollinators, willing to feed off the nectar from any available pollen source. While generally docile, females are capable of stinging. Primarily active during the day, this species may take refuge on larger flowers during the night. The social nature of varies with females seeming to prefer to be solitary, while groups of males may gather on a single plant. Like most members of the Halictidae family, Angeles striped-sweat bees are considered ground bees as females build their nests in the form of tunnels in soil, or other substrates. Halictidae bees do not feed their young honey, but instead leave balls of pollen in the nest where eggs are laid for the young to consume. It's unclear if the nests of A. Angelicus are communally shared by females or not.

Feminist philosophers of science question how scientific research and scientific knowledge itself may be influenced and possibly compromised by the social and professional framework within which that research and knowledge is established and exists. The intersection of gender and science allows feminist philosophers to reexamine fundamental questions and truths in the field of science to reveal any signs of gender biases. It has been described as being located \\"at the intersections of the philosophy of science and feminist science scholarship\\", and has attracted considerable attention since the 1970s. Feminist epistemology often emphasizes \\"situated knowledge\\" that hinges on one's individual perspectives on a subject. Feminist philosophers often highlight the under-representation of female scientists in academia and the possibility that science currently has androcentric biases. Scientific theory has been accused of being more compatible with male cognitive styles and reasoning. Feminist epistemology suggests that integrating feminine modes of thought and logic that are undervalued by current scientific theory will enable improvement and broadening of scientific perspectives. Advocates assert that it may be guide in creating a philosophy of science that is more accessible to public. Practitioners of feminist philosophy of science also seek to promote gender equality in scientific fields and greater recognition of the achievements of female scientists. Critics have argued that the political commitments of advocates of feminist philosophy of science is incompatible with modern-day scientific objectivity, emphasizing the success of the scientific method due to its lauded objectivity and \\"value-free\\" methods of knowledge-making.alt= History The feminist Philosophy of science was born out of feminist science studies in the 1960s. It would however be the 1980s before Feminist Philosophy of Science would develop its own unique identity. One of the first and most important publications released was from a women's academic journal called Signs with a piece titled: \\"Women, Science, and Society\\" This piece was published in August 1978 by Catherine Stimpson and Joan Burstyn. \\"This first collection of what today would be recognizable as \\"feminist science studies\\" featured scholarship in three areas: critiques of gender bias in science, history of women in science, and social science data and public policy considerations on the status of women in the science\\". These three topics have remained prominent issues in feminist science studies of modern day. Feminist science studies had become more philosophical and more ambitious by the 1980s and even pursued to redefine the core epistemological concepts. The reason for this shift in feminist science studies was due to a corresponding shift in many fields of academic feminism. This shift led to a parting of ways between scholarship on \\"women in science\\" and \\"feminist critiques of science\\". This was documented by feminist scholars Helen Longino and Evelynn Hammonds in their 1990 book Conflicts and Tensions in the Feminist Study of Gender and Science. By the late nineties, feminist science studies had become well-established and had many prominent scholars within its field of study. Philosopher John Searle characterized feminism in 1993 as a \\"cause to be advanced\\" more so than a \\"domain to be studied\\". Feminist philosophy of science =Objectivity and values= Some have questioned the objectivity of Feminist Philosophy of Science. Feminists however argue that rather than undermine objectivity, incorporating feminist values could help create more robust and sophisticated research methods which in turn may well produce better results. By implementing feminist ideologies in science, this will eliminate the androcentric bias in the field of science, creating better research, better healthcare, and more opportunities for women in higher education and research fields. Many feminist in this field try to challenge the idea that science is \\"value-free\\", meaning that science is subjected to societal effects, and the research that is conducted is thought to have some bias attached. Science is not autonomous and research requires funding which policy decisions come into play. This is where political and societal affect science making it adherent to a set of ideas. =Standpoint and knowledge= Feminist Philosophy of Science has traditionally been highly critical of the lack of access and opportunities for women in science and believe science can, and has been \\"distorted by sexist values\\" Sharon Crasnow highlights how the \\"exclusion of women as researchers and subjects\\" in scientific research, studies and projects can lead to incomplete methods and methodologies and ultimately unreliable or inaccurate results. Some feminist philosophies of science question whether science can lay claim to \\"impartiality, neutrality, autonomy, and indifference to political positions and the values\\" when the \\"neutral\\" position is benchmarked against the values held by one culture, i.e. western patriarchy, among the multitude of cultures participating in modern science. A complete Standpoint theory contains seven parts to fully understand the location of power one has, their \\"epistemic privilege\\". Anderson lays these out in her journal Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science. The first point of the theory must state the social location of the authority. The second, how large is the grasp of this authority, what does it claim privilege over. Third, what aspect of the social location allows authority. Fourth, the grounds of the authority, what justifies their privilege. Fifth, the type of epistemic privilege it is claiming to have. Sixth, the other perspectives similar to its own. Lastly, access to this privilege, by occupying the social location is it sufficient to gain access to the perspective. Relating to Objectivity, epistemology can give a fuller understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge. Feminist epistemology is one of a group of approaches in science studies that urges us to recognize the role of the social in the production of knowledge. Feminist epistemology directs people to consider features of themselves and culture as beings of knowledge that had been outside what was considered appropriate. The goals of researchers and the values that shape the choice of goals are relevant to the knowledge we arrive at. This has implications both for how we train scientists and for how we educate everyone about science. If science is seen as more connected to application, more related to human needs and desires, traditionally underrepresented groups will have greater motivation to succeed and persist in their science courses or pursue scientific careers. Motivation will be greater as members of underrepresented groups see how science can produce knowledge that has value to their concerns in ways that are consistent with good scientific methodology. Feminist epistemology urges a continued exploration of science in this way and so has much to offer science education. =Challenges and contributions= One of the major challenges facing feminist philosophers of science lies in convincing some skeptics in the fields of philosophy and science that Feminist Philosophy of Science is in fact a legitimate and objective field of academic research and study rather than an agenda driven ideology. Dr. Richardson points out that those who level this accusation at Feminist Philosophy of Science completely misunderstand its motivations and ambitions. Richardson describes how many feminist philosophers of science are involved in \\"ambitious constructive projects to build a better science\\". Case studies have played a major role in furthering and advancing feminist philosophy of science. For example, a study conducted by Lloyd in 2005 on the function female orgasm. She explores how evolutionary biologists made false assumptions as to the function of the female orgasm. They believed that it must have reproductive purpose in females simply because it does in males. They went as far as to ignore clear evidence as it went against their initial beliefs. This critique caused extensive debate as it attacked the core beliefs held by evolutionary biologists. Work like this has and is currently being conducted by feminist philosophers of science as they challenge traditional philosophical questions such as pluralism, objectivity and background assumptions. One of the greatest challenges faced by female philosophers is marginalization within the academic field of philosophy according to Dr. Richardson. They face exclusion in scientific fields and are marginalized and vastly unrepresented similarly to minorities in the field of philosophy. Their critiques of many topics such as gender bias are often changed, distorted and ineffectively translated by scientists and therefore by the general public. Elaine Howes has stated that the feminist philosophy of science can be applied to K-12 schooling. Per her examination of the gender separation in STEM subjects, she believes that the feminist philosophy of science should also be applied to public schools. By using feminist theories to examine gender biases in public schools, Howes suggests that possible reforms that could be implemented to close the gap in science, technology, engineering, and math. Her belief is by starting from the bottom, many girls would enter a STEM field and stick with it because of the reforms she suggested and then create a change in the field of science from within. =Socially responsible science (SRS)= Socially responsible science is a combination of epistemic roles and social values. This conjuncture of research/evidence and ethics is used by Feminist of Philosophy for the creation of \\"good science\\". In Matthew Brown's article \\"The Source and Status of Values for Socially Responsible Science\\", he discusses this lens of being socially engaged in science, to \\"craft better ethics codes for their professional societies\\", he believes this is done by emphasizing \\"ethics and social and political philosophy as least as much as epistemology and metaphysics\\". By valuing the study of ethics, politics, and social studies and applying this socially responsible science, Browne believes this will create a new agenda for science.

He was awarded the title of \\"Teacher of the Empire\\" by the Tang emperors Xuanzong (712-756), Suzong (756-763) and Daizong (763-779). Since Emperor Wuzong (841-846) believed in Taoism, he ordered to demolish Buddhist temples, confiscate temple lands and force monks to return to secular life. Daxingshan Temple was destroyed in this movement. After the fall of Tang dynasty, Daxingshan Temple fell into oblivion. =Ming dynasty= During the Yongle era (1403-1424) of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), monk Yunfeng () settled at Daxingshan Temple, he supervised the construction of halls and drum tower, and preached Chan Buddhism there. =Qing dynasty= During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the temple underwent three renovations, respectively in the ruling of Shunzhi Emperor (1648) and in the reign of Kangxi Emperor (1694) and in the Tongzhi period (1862-1874). But the temple was badly damaged during the Taiping Rebellion. =Republic of China= In 1943, Daxingshan Temple became the site of a Buddhist college and the Association of Chinese Religious Believers, which were founded by Taixu, Yu Bin and Feng Yuxiang. =People's Republic of China= After the establishment of the Communist State in 1955, the Chinese government appropriated a large sum of money for constructing the temple. On August 6, 1956, it was listed among the first batch of provincial level cultural heritage by the Shaanxi Provincial Government. During the Cultural Revolution the Red Guards had attacked the temple in 1966. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the national policy of free religious belief, the Buddhist Association of Shaanxi took over the temple and started a reconstruction project. In 1984, it has been designated as a National Key Buddhist Temple in Han Chinese Area by the State Council of China. In 1985, it became the site of Buddhist Association of Xi'an. That same year, the Japanese Shingon presented a bronze statue of Ksitigarbha to the temple. In 2015, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi visited the temple. Architecture The Mahavira Hall at the temple. Along the central axis of the temple stand six buildings including the Shanmen, Four Heavenly Kings Hall, Mahavira Hall, Guanyin Hall, Meditation Hall, and Dharma Hall. Subsidiary structures were built on both sides of the central axis including the Drum Tower, Bell Tower, Ksitigarbha Hall, and Manjusri Hall. =Shanmen= The extant Shanmen was built in the Ming dynasty with a two story single eave gable and hip roof (). On both sides of the shanmen there are two Chinese guardian lions. =Four Heavenly Kings Hall= Maitreya is enshrined in the Hall of Four Heavenly Kings and at the back of his statue is a statue of Skanda. Four Heavenly Kings' statues are enshrined in the left and right side of the hall. The statues of Maitreya and Skanda were made in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Under the eaves is a plaque with the Chinese characters \\"Hall of Heavenly Kings\\" written by the former Venerable Master of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puchu. =Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall= The Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall houses the statues of Ksitigarbha and Yama. In front of the hall, a wooden plaque with Chinese characters \\"Ping'an Ksitigarbha Hall\\" () was written by former abbot Jieming (). =Mahavira Hall= The Mahavira Hall is the main hall in the temple. In the middle of the hall placed the statues of Five Buddha, with statues of Guanyin, Shancai and Longn√º at his back. The statues of Twenty-four Gods stand on both sides of the hall. =Guanyin Hall= A Ming dynasty wood carving statue of Thousand Armed and Eyed Guanyin is placed in the hall.

The stated mission of the organization was ‚Äúto encourage and assist Himalayan travel and exploration, and to extend knowledge of the Himalaya and adjoining mountain ranges through science, art, literature and sport.‚Äù The Club publishes a journal, the Himalayan Journal and has a library. Chewang Motup Goba from Ladakh is the current president of The Himalayan Club.  History  The idea to start such an organization was proposed in 1866 by Mr. F. Drew and Mr. W. H. Johnson to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Douglas Freshfield, active member of the Royal Geographic Society wrote in the Alpine Journal in 1884, \\"The formation at Calcutta or Simla,\\" he said, \\"of (a) Himalayan Club, prepared to publish Narratives of Science and Adventure' concerning the mountains, would be the most serviceable means to this end.\\" The organization was finally established on 17 February 1928 in the office of Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood. A library was established at Shimla. Some of the 127 founding members were: * Sir G. L. Corbett, Secretary for Commerce and Industry; * Major Kenneth Mason of the Survey of India * Mr. T. E. T. Upton, Solicitor to the Government of India * Major General Walter Kirke, acting Chief of the General Staff * Brigadier E. A.

A library was initially established in Shimla at United Service Institution of India but moved to the Survey of India and in 1932 to New Delhi. In 1947, most of the British members left India but continued to be members. With more members in Calcutta, it was managed from there and the library moved from the Army headquarters to the Calcutta Light Horse Club in 1948. In 1958 the library moved to the Geological Survey of India and in 1966 it moved to the National Library of India in Calcutta. In 1971, it moved back to New Delhi where it was housed in the Central Secretariat and before moving to the Indian International Centre in 1976 where it continues to be located.

In his later years he worked as a composer for television and radio, as a sound engineer and as an educator. Phil was born in Newton Longville, Buckinghamshire in 1951. His first instrument was the trumpet, which he picked up at the age of 6 before switching to bass guitar during his school years. He joined his first band, The Stormbeats, in 1961, playing at the local cinema on Saturday mornings. When asked on his motivation for becoming a musician, Phil claimed that it was \\"to get girls!\\". Phil went on to study music at Watford College of Music before moving to London in pursuit of a career in music. Early career In 1968 Phil joined The Spirit of John Morgan. The group toured the UK extensively. In May 1968 the band began a fortnightly residency at the Marquee Club in London alongside Jethro Tull and 10 Years After. The group recorded their self-titled debut in September 1969 at Olympic Studios for the Carnaby Label. Their second album \\"Age Machine\\" was released in 1970. Phil was briefly a member of the Steve Gibbons Band. Phil also rehearsed with Thunderclap Newman around this period but decided against joining the group - the band went onto have a #1 single with Something In The Air.Curtis, Phil - anecdotal/informal Arthur Brown & Kingdom Come Phil joined Arthur Brown's Kingdom Come in October 1971 as replacement for Desmond Fisher. In the early days of the group Phil, Arthur Brown and Andy Dalby lived together in a band commune in Beckenham and occasionally crossed paths with a young David Bowie. Phil recorded bass, vocals and percussion on two Kingdom Come albums: Kingdom Come (1972) and Journey (1973). Phil helped cement the title \\"Journey\\", as Arthur Brown explained in the liner notes for the 2010 re-release of \\"Journey\\": > \\"I had this song which had the line ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going on a journey/I‚Äôm not coming > back‚Äô, and it was Phil [Curtis] who suggested we call the album Journey ‚Äì > and we never really did come back.‚Äù Brown, A.

Whilst it had originally been planned that Dennis Taylor would produce the album, Dave Edmunds, who was also at Rockfield during the time, expressed an interest in the record and took over the producer role. It was the first album ever to use a drum machine (The Bentley Rhythm Ace) exclusively. The album was released in 1973 by Polydor in the UK and Passport Records in the US. It was considered a pioneering album - ahead of its time, it has retrospectively gained praise from critics: \\"Journey was so far ahead of its time that you have to keep checking the sleeve to make sure that it really does say 1973 and not 1983‚Ä¶ not only Arthur Brown‚Äôs masterpiece, but also one of the truly great albums of the seventies.\\" Author and journalist Mark Paytress said the album \\"remains a classic of pioneering electronic rock, up there with Kraftwerk and assorted krautrock trailblazers.\\"Paytress, Mark.

These were later included in both the 2003 and 2010 re-releases of \\"Journey\\" by Castle Music and Esoteric Recordings respectively. The Peel Sessions were recorded at Kensington House, Shepherd's Bush and Maida Vale 4.

Lennon joined the touring party for the after show party at the Waldorf Astoria. In 1975 The Kiki Dee Band embarked on a headline tour of the UK from February to March. March 1975 also saw the band record for the BBC at the Paris Theatre in London. On 18 September 1976 The Kiki Dee Band supported Queen in Hyde Park, London. Between 150,000 - 200,000 attended the all day concert which remains a record breaking figure in Hyde Park's history. November 1976 saw the band embark on another 14 UK Tour, finishing at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 2 December. The band were joined onstage by Elton John as a surprise guest at St George's Hall in Bradford on 21 November 1976. The support band for this tour was the Vapour Trails, who Phil also played bass for alongside fellow former Kingdom Come member Andy Dalby on guitar and John McBurnie on vocals. = BBC Sessions and Television Appearances = Phil appeared numerous times on Top of the Pops with Kiki and the band in 1974 and 1975 performing \\"I‚Äôve Got The Music in Me\\". He also appeared on The Old Grey Whistle Test (Season 4, Episode 7) as well as International television shows such as Germany's Musikladen. The Kiki Dee Band recorded several sessions for BBC Radio and Television. In March 1975 the group were recorded for BBC Radio's \\"In Concert\\" series. The band were featured on BBC Sight and Sound on 26 February 1976, performing 12 songs at The Hippodrome in Golders Green, London.  Tiger  In 1976 Phil joined Tiger, founded by London session musician Big Jim Sullivan (who had played on over 750 charting singles and 54 #1 hits during his session career.) Tiger were mostly a studio band though they did appear as support act on Hawkwind's 1976 UK Tour and at Reading Festival 1976. Phil played bass on the debut album \\"Tiger\\" which was released by Warner Brothers in the US and EMI in the UK.  Vapour Trails  Phil formed his own band called Vapour Trails with friends and musicians he had met during his time with Arthur Brown and Kiki Dee. Vapour Trails toured as the support act to The Kiki Dee Band (of which Phil and Vapour Trails singer John McBurnie were both members) during her 1976 UK Tour. In the late 1970s Phil moved to Los Angeles with the Vapour Trails.(Source private) (2018) Phil Curtis' Life story memorial Powerpoint Presentation - shown at celebration of his life after his passing. The core members were John McBurnie on vocals (The Kiki Dee Band) and Andy Dalby (Kingdom Come) on guitar. Other musicians involved in the group included English keyboardist Brian Chatton and Wings drummer Steve Holley. In 1979 The Vapour Trails recorded their self-titled debut in 1979 after negotiating a $3 million recording contract with Warner Brothers. The album was produced and remixed by Larry Carlton at his private studio, Room 335, in Hollywood. The self-titled album has been described as \\"a great album of Westcoast Pop\\". It was re-released in 1980 under the name The VT's and titled \\"Autumn Breeze\\" by Polystar in Japan, where the band had a large following due to the use of the album's title track \\"Don‚Äôt Worry Baby\\" as theme song for the hit Japanese music show Best Hit USA. \\"Don‚Äôt Worry Baby\\" remained the theme song of the show from its debut airing in 1981 until its finale in September 1989. As a result of this, the song became one of the most well-known non-Japanese songs among the Japanese population. The album has been re-released numerous times, most recently in 2008 by Wounded Bird Records.  Session career  Phil's career as a session player in the 1960s and 1970s saw him work with many notable artists, including Chris Rea (on his critically acclaimed debut album ‚ÄúWhatever Happened to Benny Santini?‚Äù), Gilbert O‚ÄôSullivan and The Bay City Rollers, who Phil toured Japan with as part of their backing band during the 1970s.

Phil worked as a tutor at dBs Music (formerly Deep Blue Sound) in Plymouth from the early 2000s until 2014. He was hugely influential to students and left a lasting impact on their lives, helping forge many new musical careers and left a lasting legacy with those he worked with. Nigel Burt, Director of dBs Music commented: \\"Phil Curtis joined the company in the very early days and inspired many students and indeed staff with his knowledge and stories of the music industry. Phil has a wonderful and well-documented career, a great bass player, a musical genius but more importantly, a true gentleman and all round wonderful man.\\" In his final years Phil spent time in Los Angeles, reuniting with old music friends and collaborating on new work as well as doing more bass sessions. Phil died on 14 March 2018, aged 66. Following news of his death Kiki Dee posted a tribute to Phil on her official Twitter account: \\"I am sad to say Phil Curtis Bass player with the original Kiki Dee band passed away last week, he was a true character and a great musician, plus always fun to be with. My thoughts are with his family.\\" Former students also left tributes on the dBs Music website and shared their memories: \\"He was so fundamental in so many student's musical journey. I can say without a doubt that without Phil I wouldn't have the career I do today as a musician. He single handedly convinced me to pursue it and supported me through everything.\\" References Category:1951 births Category:2018 deaths ","title":"Phil Curtis"},{"id":"57240440","text":"Peter Evans was a British journalist and author who wrote for the Daily Express and wrote several unauthorized biographies of public figures including Aristotle Onassis and the Kennedy family.https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/01/peter-evans-dead-daily- express-author-journalist_n_1848959.html  Publications  * Nemesis: The True Story of Aristotle Onassis, Jackie O, and the Love Triangle That Brought Down the Kennedys (2004) (ReganBooks) * Ari: The Life and Times of Aristotle Socrates Onassis * Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations (2014) * The Mask Behind the Mask, a Life of Peter Sellers * Goodbye Baby & Amen * The Englishman's Daughter * Titles * Behind Palace Doors (with Nigel Dempster) References Category:British biographers Category:British journalists Category:2012 deaths ","title":"Peter Evans (author)"},{"id":"57240455","text":"Mijo Miletic (born 2 June 1998) is a Bosnian-Herzegovinian footballer who plays for Union Gurten.

On its publication in 1983 it won the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award. The story is told from the perspective of the four granddaughters of the \\"Queen of Persia\\", an Ohio farmwife, during the 1950s. The narration takes place in the first person plural, an effect that Margaret Atwood believed evoked the collective female unconscious. The plot casts backwards and forwards through time, being divided into three main sections: the first has the narrating sisters in their teens, the second regresses back to their childhood, and the third see the sale of the family farm and the dispersal of the family. The book drew comparisons to the works of Anne Tyler, Marilynne Robinson, Douglas Unger and Susan Engberg. After falling out of print the book was republished in 2014 by New York Review Books.

The granddaughters are relatively close in age and act nearly as one body until their slightly older cousin Celia hits puberty and begins to attract male attention, much to the distress of her mother, Aunt Libby. As Celia begins to date, she and Aunt Libby constantly fight. Eventually Celia finds a responsible older boyfriend, Phillip, who wants to marry Celia and whom Aunt Libby approves of. The family eventually learns that Phillip has impregnated another woman. Though Phillip still wants to marry Celia she refuses him and becomes friends with Louanne, the woman he impregnated. Celia eventually settles down with Jimmy, one of her previous suitors, and much to her grandmother's distress, becomes fixated on motherhood. When they are children the girls learns the family history of how their grandmother came to be a wealthy woman. Forced into domestic labour at an early age, Lil married a man she loved, Jacob, who quickly turned abusive. She gave birth to seven children; two sons who died in infancy and five daughters: May, Elinor, Grace, Libby and Rachel. At a family reunion she encounters her rich uncle Burl who, as she is the daughter of his favorite sister, decides to help her financially. Endowed with his gifts, Lil becomes an independent woman buying farmland, educating her daughters and ensuring that they always have a home to stay in as they struggle through their marriages and motherhood. Grace has a tempestuous on again and off again marriage with a handsome athlete turned salesman and wannabe writer named Neil. Even after they marry Grace continues to return to her mother's home with her daughters for long periods. When Neil drops by to bring her home she declines to return with him. He defers his anger onto the cousins for acting up and tries to whip his daughters only to give up and end up revealing instead that their mother is dying. Grace's illness brings her the attention of her sister Elinor, a rich ad executive living in New York City. She is a Christian Scientist and persuades her sister and nieces that the religion will save Grace. Though Grace manages to outlive the time frame her doctor's had promised she does die and Elinor misses her death by a matter of hours. To everyone's surprise Grace leaves \\"Neil's\\" house in Illinois to her daughters asking that it be sold and the proceeds remain in trust for them. Neil destroys Grace's will, but Lil owns the loan for the house and calls it in, determined he will get nothing. Shortly after Anne climbs a tree to its highest point and falls and injures herself trying to swing down off it. Neil comes back to tend to her and retrieve his children and in the aftermath Lil decides to let him keep the house. The girls grow up with Anne and Katie living with Neil but spending summers on the farm. After Celia's marriage Lil decides to sell the land to a development that wants to turn the area into a mall. The family is devastated but Lil throws out nearly everything left in the house. They receive news from Texas that Celia is pregnant; later Aunt Libby gets a call from a doctor informing her that Celia tried to commit suicide and lost the baby. She will be returning home into the care of her mother. Characters *Lil Krauss, the matriarch of the family, nicknamed the Queen of Persia by her granddaughters. Born sometime in the 1880s.

The genre includes a variety of techniques, including woodcutting, etching and lithography. History Seder Avodat Hakodesh title page, woodcut, printed by Yisrael Beck The modern printing industry in Israel goes back to the second half of the 19th century, when a number of printing houses were established in Jerusalem. These printing houses dealt with the printing of texts in which various artistic images were incorporated. The first Hebrew printing house was established by Yisrael Beck (abbreviation of Baal Koreh) in Safed in 1841 and transferred to Jerusalem in 1841. Beck worked with presses and tools for casting letters he brought with him from Europe. The first press was a wooden table-shaped press, a heavy metal plate laid on the paper undergoing the printing operation.See Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, (Hadera: Museum of Printing Art and Hadera Paper, 1973), p. 37 In 1842, Beck received the printing presses nicknamed \\"Massat Moshe and Yehudit\\" (he: ◊û◊©◊ê◊™ ◊û◊©◊î ◊ï◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊™) from Moses Montefiore. Its area of print was 85 cm long and 57 cm wide.This press was sold by Beck's son to the Zuckerman Printing Press (see, Joseph Olitzky, The Art of Printing, p. 37, 53-54). The press was later moved to the Levin-Epstein Press and is housed today at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya The first book printed by Beck in Jerusalem was \\"Seder Avodat Hakodes\\" (he: ◊°◊ì◊® ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊™ ◊î◊ß◊ï◊ì◊©) by Chaim Yosef David Azulai.The title page is decorated with a hybrid wood engraving technique. In the center is an image of a two-column gate in the Ionic order, bearing a decorative frieze with an acanthus leaf. The page is framed with an ornamental flower patterns.See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 188-189. Christian printing houses such as the Armenian St. James Printing House were founded in 1833; the Franciscan printing house in 1846 under the direction of Sebastian Pratschner; the printing house of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in 1853 and a printing house in 1885 at the Schneller Orphanage.See Gil Gordon, \\"'The best one in the Black Art: The Print-shop of Schneller's German Protestant Mission in Palestine in the late Ottoman Period',\\" Cathedra 138 (2010): 83-110. Most of these printing houses produced texts in Letterpress printing. However, various illustrations were sometimes included. These illustrations were created using woodcut, wood engraving or metal engraving techniques and were limited by the size the print. Most of the decorations were assigned to the title page of the book. This page usually consisted of a decorative frame created from a print or image of the Holy Land. In addition, the printing houses produced decorated certificates, \\"Mizrach\\" plaques [ornamental or sacred pictures hung on the east wall of a house or synagogue in the direction of Jerusalem], etc. Some of the printing blocks were made by the printing house itself and others were commissioned. Abraham Leib Monzon, for example, created some of the printing blocks for his printing house, while others were created by artists like Meir Rozin. The \\"Shiviti\\" by Shimon Israel Shane was printed using three blocks depicting the Western Wall, Rachel's Tomb and the Tombs of the Kings with the addition of hand-painted and hand-stamped seals.See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p. 49-51. In many cases, these illustrations were reused for different purposes and even shared by different printing houses.See Yona Fischer, ed., Art and Craft in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum,1979), p.184. The first use of the technique of lithograph printing was at the Salomon Printing House (he: ◊ì◊§◊ï◊° ◊°◊ú◊ï◊û◊ï◊ü), founded by Yoel Moshe Salomon and Michal HaCohen, who learned the technique in K√∂nigsberg.See: Inspiration and Implementation: The Story of the Salomon (Zoref) Family (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2011), p. 10- 11. During their studies there HaCohen and Solomon printed a pamphlet entitled \\"Altar Stones,\\" in which they detailed the process of creating a lithographic print.See Shoshana Halevi, The Beginning of Hebrew Printing in Eretz Israel, on the website Daat (http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/mahanaim/halevi-1.htm) (first published in Mahanayim, 1966), p. 106-107. Their decision to import the technique to Israel probably stemmed from their desire to serve as an alternative to the printing house of Back, which for 20 years had held a monopoly in the field of Jewish printmaking. One of the first works printed by the new printing house was \\"Shoshanta\\" (1862), the name for a local version of a decorative ornament drawn from European traditions. Along with the descriptions, there were also photographs of places such as the Tomb of Absalom, Tower of David, the Western Wall, etc. Another printing press that was known for its artistic works was A.L. Monsohn Printing House (he: ◊ì◊§◊ï◊° ◊ê.◊ú. ◊û◊ï◊†◊ñ◊ï◊ü), which began operations in 1892. The printing house began operating with a hand press and in 1894 brought an automatic machine from Europe that could produce about 1,000 pages per hour.[10] A major part of the work of this printing press was the use of the lithograph printing technique. Among other things, it created prints of up to half a sheet (50x70 cm),See: A.L. Monsohn Lithographic Press,1892-1992, (Jerusalem: The Ari Synagogue, 2009), p. 2. from the works of artists such as Rozin, Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi, and others, who also began to make use of photographs created using the lithographic technique,See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., 100 Years of Printing in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p.11. The photographs were converted to lithographs in a process that included the use of the technique of etching and transfer paper (Decalcomania).  1900‚Äì1950 Portrait of Theodor Herzel (1903) by Hermann Struck. Etching and soft-ground To the Synagogue (1921) by Josef Budko. Woodcut While the people of the 'Old Yishuv' perceived art as a religious art that served the liturgy, at the beginning of the 20th century, art became more prevalent in modern Hebrew culture. Expressions of Judaism also began to gain national significance, following the expansion of the Zionist movement in Europe. The artists who came from Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, already experienced artists with a standing in the print industry, contributed most to the development of this medium in the Eretz Israel. Another central milestone in the development of this concept is the establishment of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem in 1906. =Hermann Struck and successors= The most prominent Jewish artist in the European printing industry was Hermann Struck, who was associated with many Expressionist artists, was even a member of the Sezessionstil in Berlin, and exhibited consistently until 1913. Along with landscapes, Struck created portraits and genre descriptions of Jewish life, particularly in Eastern Europe. He did this in a variety of print techniques such as lithograph and etching. Over the years he published several files of prints as a book, but Struck's most famous and successful book was Die Kunst des Radierens (The Art of Etching), published in Berlin in 1908 by Paul Kasirer. The book described the process of printing etchings, interspersed with illustrations by Struck. Because of the popularity of the book, which appealed to both artists and to the public as a whole, it was printed in four additional editions between 1912 and 1923. The book established Struck's fame as a leading artist in the print industry. Jacob Steinhardt and Joseph Budko, who studied print with Struck, also dealt often with themes from the Shtetl, not only as an ethnographic depiction, as Struck did, but also as a spiritual expression. Part of the change stemmed from the influence of expressionism on these artists. For Steinhardt, for example, this effect was expressed in a theatrical atmosphere rich in pathos and grotesque expressions.See One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 66. Between 1907 and 1935, Steinhardt created about 250 etchings, but in Palestine he began to work in the wood cut ,combining Wood engraving parts, both because of his inability to produce these etchings and as an expression of the influence of the light in Palestine, which he expresses in the contrasting blacks and whites characteristic of this medium.See: Amishai-Meisels, Ziva, Jacob Steinhardt: Etchings and Lithographs, (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1981), p. 18. Along with their independent works, the two also created Illustrations in various print techniques for various Hebrew publications that were published in Europe at the time. Among these are the woodcuts that Steinhardt created for the Book of Jonah (1924) and the Passover Haggadah (Berlin: Ferdinand Auster, 1923), accompanied by a calligraphic text created by Franzisca Baruch, and the lithographs created by Budko for Shmuel Yosef Agnon‚Äôs And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight (1919), as well as his prints for the 50th edition (Berlin: Hovevei Ha-Shir Ha-Ivrit, 1923) of the writings of Hayim Nahman Bialik. =1906‚Äì1930: Bezalel = Bezalel Jerusalem, Lithographical Establishment, Photograph by Ya'acov Ben-Dov. Jerusalem Print Workshop collection With the establishment of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Crafts, Ephraim Moses Lilien, one of the leading illustrators in Europe, arrived in Jerusalem. His artistic style derived from the European \\"Jugendstil\\" and his work expressed the main Zionist national outlook at the time. Lilien was also in the habit of taking photographs from which he would create his drawings and prints. Despite the fact that he lived only a short time in Jerusalem, his style influenced Bezalel's main style of design. In 1909, a lithography department was opened at Bezalel, headed by Avraham Gershowitz (Gershuni). This department printed a limited number of artistic works, mainly by artists such as Shmuel Ben-David and Ya‚Äôakov (Jacob) Stark. However, the print quality was poor and was not suitable for producing large editions, mainly due to the technical equipment. Boris Schatz himself testified in 1917 that the school had equipment to \\"make experimental leaves,\\" but that \\"we do not have a printing machine.\\"Boris Schatz, \\"A Proposal to Strengthen and Distribute Craftsmanship in Jerusalem and Eretz-Israel in General,\\" in Shilo-Cohen, Nurit, Schatz's Bezalel, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1982), p.178. In addition to the artistic endeavors, the department also did commercial work such as printing textbooks and other materials, such as lottery cards designed by Shmuel Haruvi.See: One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 13-15; Also: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Comment on the Beginning of Lithography in Eretz Israel,\\" on the website \\"Gideon Ofrat‚Äôs Warehouse\\" ( https://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/), 7 September 2016. Most of the lithographic work at Bezalel included realistic prints of portraits and genre descriptions, as well as a few commercial works. In 1919 Yisrael Hirschfeld, a student of Bezalel in 1915‚Äì1917, was sent to Vienna to learn the art of lithograph printing. Throughout his stay there, he exchanged letters with Bezalel teachers like Abel Penn, Schatz, and others who asked him to purchase a press and lithographic equipment for Bezalel, despite the fact that they did not send money to him.His letters are in the custody of his daughters in Jerusalem. Copies of them are in the Information Center for Israeli Art. A small notebook with documentation of his studies in Vienna was donated by his daughters to the Jerusalem Print Workshop. In 1921 Penn himself went to Vienna and purchased a press and accompanying equipment.Yigal Zalmona, The Art of Abel Pann- From Montparnasse to the Land of the Bible, (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003), p. XIV-XV. On this press, Penn printed the series of illustrations for the Bible he created. There is however some disagreement with regard to the printing technique of these works. While Penn declared he used lithographic printing, others declared that it was a type of offset, claiming that Jerusalem presses were unsuitable for use as a basis for lithographic printing.See: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Comment on the Beginnings of Offset Printing in Eretz Israel,\\" retrieved from Gideon Ofrat‚Äôs Storeroom, http://gideonofrat.wordpress.com/, 7 September 2015. Alongside Bezalel, in 1923 Ze'ev Raban and Meir Gur Arie established the Industrial Art Studio (he: ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊î ◊ú◊¢◊ë◊ï◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊ô◊†◊ì◊ï◊°◊ò◊®◊ô◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ï◊™) and Graphica Press which printed posters of a limited size and various prints in the Jugendstil style.See: Gideon Ofrat, \\"Lilien and the Tradition of the Jugendstil in ‚ÄòBezalel‚Äô\\", in: On the Land: Eretz-Israel Art: Pirkei Avot, pp. 211-197. Another artist who worked in the field independently was Jacob Eisenberg, who printed etchings in a workshop in his home in Jerusalem.See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), pp. 14-15, in particular pp. 208-205. During the 1920s, the influence of modernist art was evident among some Bezalel students who continued their studies in Europe or were exposed to contemporary art. These were works that established an artistic opposition to the school that expressed the spirit of the period of the Tower of David. Artists such as Nachum Gutman, Israel Paldi and others created expressive etchings and, particularly, woodcuts. Among these works is a series of prints called \\"The God Seekers\\" (1923; he: ◊û◊ë◊ß◊©◊ô ◊ê◊ú◊ï◊î◊ô◊ù), created by Reuven Rubin, and the series of prints \\"Jaffa\\" (1925) by Israel Paldi. Late recognition was given to the series \\"Gray Tura\\" (1924; he: ◊ò◊ï◊®◊ê ◊ê◊§◊ï◊®◊î) created by Arieh Allweil in Europe, which was displayed in Israel only in the 1990s. 1930‚Äì1950  Miron Sima, Yehuda Wolpert, Isidore Aschheim, Jacob Pines, Yossi Stern and Mordecai Ardon at Cafe Ta'mon, Jerusalem, 1940s In the 1930s, the printing industry began to take on greater importance in the field of Eretz Israeli art. The development of the field was closely linked to the Fifth Aliyah, in which many artists came to Eretz Israel and Jerusalem. These artists, persecuted by their countries of origin in Germany and Austria, sought to continue the spirit of European modernism in general and the heritage of German art movements such as Bauhaus and Expressionism in particular.See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 26; also: Yigal Zalmona, 100 Years of Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2015), p.102. In addition, the art of the time reflected in many ways the construction of Zionist national consciousness. An example of this can be found in stamps issued by the Jewish National Fund, quoting images drawn from artists such as Struck, Lilien, Budko, Steinhardt, and others, who reflected the worldview of the creators of the artistic print, and whose images could at that time easily pass from private to nationalistic art.See: We Shall not Forget You, Exile (Jerusalem, Jewish National Fund, 1945). The opening of the Tel Aviv Museum, in 1934, was accompanied by the dedication of one of the two halls of Tel Aviv Museum to works in the various print fields.See: \\"Etchings Exhibitions,\\" Doar Hayom [Post Office Today], 28 January 1934. Other examples of the growing importance of the field can be found in an article published on 20 October 1935, in Haaretz, entitled \\"The Question of Hebrew Graphics\\"See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p.26. and the printing of a Dictionary of Graphic Arts published by Mordecai Narkis in 1937 by the Bialik Institute and the Hebrew Language Committee. The publication of the dictionary reflected the activities of The Bezalel National Museum in the 1920s and 1930s and the need to create uniform and clear terms for the various print terms. The dictionary of Narkis, dedicated to Hermann Struck on the occasion of his 60th birthday, was based on the German language, whose terms are \\"most common among the graphic artists living in Israel.\\"Mordechai Narkis, Dictionary of Graphic Terms, (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute Publishing, 1937), p. 5. A review of these documents reveals that the term \\"graphics\\" included both the artistic print and the graphic design field. This mixture would remain a guiding principle in the school of \\"New Bezalel School for Arts and Crafts\\" which was opened in 1935 in Jerusalem. The curriculum of the school aspired to raise the artistic level of design in Israel, while providing practical opportunities for students to earn a living. This practical approach demonstrated the fact that Hebrew industry (and, to some extent, the Hebrew city) also began to serve as another legitimate expression of Zionist activity. Therefore, the school, whose first director was Budko, did not open an art track, but rather a track for practical graphics, which was headed by Rudi Deutsch (Dayan). The department dealt mainly with lithograph printing, which was the most popular commercial technique at the time.See: Gideon Ofrat, The New Bezalel: The Bezalel Academy of Art and Design (Jerusalem, 1987), p. 72-83. Jacob Steinhardt, who immigrated to Eretz Israel in 1933 opened, in what had been the home of Boris Schatz, a painting and printing studio that was a kind of opposition to the \\"New Bezalel\\", which was directed by Yosef Budko. After Budko's death in 1940, Steinhardt joined Bezalel's staff and became director of the school's graphics department. During this period, the importance of classical printing techniques, lithography, woodcutting, and engraving as a commercial printing technique became less important, eclipsed by offset printing. However, these techniques were revived through art classes at the school. During the 1940s a small community of artists, who engaged in graphic techniques, including artistic prints of various kinds, was established around the \\"New Bezalel.\\" A comprehensive view of their works shows the strong influence of German culture on everything connected to the cultural tradition (Bildung). In the prints of these artists, such as Miron Sima, Isidor Aschheim, and Jakob Eisenscher, as well as in the works of artists who worked independently of this group, such as Arieh Allweil, Paul Conrad Henich, Abraham Goldberg, Leo Roth and others, we see an attempt to combine European style with characteristics of the local Eretz Israeli reality and Zionist motifs and themes. This was often accompanied by the adoption of biographical- psychological features, which were largely missing in the works of historic Bezalel's artists. 1950‚Äì1970 From Woodcuts for Heinrich von Kleist's Michael Kohlhaas (1953 / 2003) by Jacob Pins. Woodcut, Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop Man and Bull (1964) BY Avraham Ofek. Etching and aquatint. Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 does not constitute a significant historical point in the history of Israeli art, apart from several expressions of nationalism and the development of iconography around the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. However, the opening of Mandatory Palestine to Jewish immigration led to a large population that began to be educated according to the tradition of the young field of the Israeli print, led in these years by Jacob Steinhardt in the new Bezalel. Many of the youngsters who came to Eretz Israel after the Holocaust either under the auspices of Youth Aliyah, or with their families, such as Jacob Pins, Avraham Ofek, Avigdor Arikha, Yehuda Bacon, Moshe Hoffman, among others, became prominent Israeli artists in the 1950s and 1960s. Apart from the technique of the woodcut, that could be studied at Bezalel, there were not many places that trained artists in the various print techniques. In Ein Hod and Jerusalem, Rudi Lehman taught the art of the wood cut and sculpture. A large group of artists were influenced by his approach to art, that combined animal images in a \\"primitive\\" style with a modernist ethos of creativity.See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70. This group included artists such as Shoshana Heimann, Raya Bar Adon and others.See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in, p. 71. Some training in the technique of lithograph printing was provided by Cohen, who operated the Hebrew University Press in Jerusalem. Most of the artists printed their works in his studio, or with local artists, such as David Ben Shaul, who had specialized in lithograph printing in Paris. Upon his return to Israel in 1963, he brought a lithographic press and printed works for various artists in his studio in Jerusalem.See: Arik Kilmanik, \\"Setting Up a Print Workshop\\", in: The Printer‚Äôs Imprint: Twenty Years of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1994), p. 9; also: \\"A Conversation with Arik Kilmanik\\", in: Prints from the Collection of the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984), p. 4 (no page numbers). Basing themselves on the local tradition and ethos of Paris as the capital of world art,See: Benjamin Tammuz, \\"They Returned from Paris,\\" Ha'aretz, 17 December 1951. many artists continued to travel to pursue art studies in France and Europe, unaware of the change in the world art scene and the development of the United States as an art center.While in the United States offset printing in the 1950s and 1960s became the main printing technique, the use of this technique in industry began only in the late 1950s. According to Eric Kilmanik, one of the first to engage in non- industrial printing was the daughter or granddaughter of Martin Buber, who set up an offset printing workshop in her home, where Kilmanik created a poster for a folk dance evening at the Bezalel Student Union. Aryeh Rothman, for example, went to study at the Acad√©mie Julian in 1959, and later studied in Paris at the Johnny Friedlaender engraving workshop.Rachel Angel, \\"The Engravings of Johnny Friedlander,\\" Maariv, 28 May 1976. Tuvia Beeri studied at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts (1963‚Äì1961), and continued his specialization in Friedlaender's engraving workshop. Milka Cizik, however, went to study in East Germany (1965‚Äì1961), where she studied various printing techniques at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. The French and German influences led to the adoption of modernist techniques,Newer techniques, which would come to be identified with postmodernism, began to enter the industry in Israel in the late 1950s. In Israel, for example, a silk printing was used. See: \\"Institute for the Preparation of Professional Study Materials is Established,\\"Sha‚Äôarim, 24 December 1956; And also: \\"The World of Printing,\\" Davar, 24 September 1959. such as Aryeh Rothman's use of the photographic technique of HeliograveurThe Heliograveur is a form of photogravure that dates back to the 19th century and is used to reproduce photographs. and the \\"invention\\" by others of various artistic techniques (in the spirit of late Surrealism). Miron Sima, for example, added to his woodcuts, such as \\"The Bride\\", textures printed from fabrics and chains, which sought to enrich the texture of the print, and to deepen its realism. In addition, the shortage of materials available in Israel led many artists to use other techniques that were available to them, such as Linocut, as a substitute for wood cut. Even Rudi Lehmann, despite his strong connection to artistic tradition, experimented with the use of new materials. He was one of the first artists to create woodcuts on plywood.See: Gideon Ofrat, ed., One Hundred Years of Printmaking in Israel C p. 70. The artistic print field to which these students were exposed upon their return to Israel was very limited. Not only were there no places to print editions of artistic prints, it was also considered a secondary art. In the 1960 album Graphic Art in Israel, Eugen Kolb wrote that \\"exhibitions of graphics only are considered (unfairly!) for less important exhibits.\\"Zvi Zohar and Eugen Kolb, The Israeli Graphic, (Ha-Kibbutz Artzi, Merhavia: Sifriat Poalim, 1960), p. 9. Another textual review of the Israeli print and drawing artists appeared in the book The Art of Israel (Jerusalem: Massada, 1963) by Benjamin Tammuz. Elisheva Cohen, curator of the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Bezalel National Museum and at the Israel Museum, had to publish the booklet The Print: What Is It? (1965),What is a Print? (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum,1965). in order to expose the field to visitors to the museum. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the annual general exhibition of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association of 1963, for example, only 7 artistic prints were displayed out of 375 works.Among the exhibitors were Hedwig Grossman (1), Hanna Pfizer (1), Jacob Pins (2), Arieh Rothman (2) and Shoshana Resnick (1). See: General Exhibition of Israeli Artists 1963 (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1963). Also at the exhibition Tazpit 1964, which was perceived as more artistic at the time, Tuvia Beeri was the only artist among more than 30 artists who exhibited prints.See: Tatspit [Observation Point] (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1964). Tazpit - an acronym for an Israeli painting and sculpture exhibition - was an exhibition organized by a group of artists who wanted to create an exhibition of young art that was free of institutional pressures. In this exhibition, artists who chose to work in the area of prints in those years, such as Yigal Tumarkin and Uri Lifshitz, participated, but the exhibition chose to present works in a more avant-garde style: On the subject of this exhibition, see: Galia BarOr and Hayuta Bahat: Paintings (Ein Harod: Museum of Art, 2013), pp. 13-15. However, at the same time the print was perceived in various circles as an expression of \\"good taste.\\" An example of this can be found in the publications of Moshe Spitzer, who commissioned illustrations for publications by Tarshish Publishing House that were done using various print techniques. Among these works are Avigdor Luisada's woodcuts for Yitzhak Shenhar‚Äôs Between Star and Grass (1942) and the engravings of Avigdor Arikha for A Stray Dog (1958) and the woodcuts created by Jacob Pines for the book Michael Kohlhaas (1953).However, the latter two were not printed directly from the printing board, but were transferred to print using a photographic method, which was more suitable for larger editions. See: Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015). In 1965, the printing workshop of the Artists House Tel Aviv opened under the auspices of the Israel Painters and Sculptors Association and was managed by Tuvia Beeri. The workshop gave artists for the first time a place of work to create works using engraving techniques. At the same time, Beeri opened another workshop at the Avni Institute. 1970-1990  During the 1970s and 1980s, the printing industry underwent a period of unprecedented development in Israel. A variety of print workshops made it possible for artists to create works using various techniques in this medium. A number of artists began to work in prints and in preparing printing plates for other artists in their studio. Moshe Givati established a printing workshop in Haifa that dealt mainly with screen printing technique.Between 1970 and 1971, Givati worked at a silk-printing workshop at his studio in Haifa, where he created works in the wake of Yitzhak Danziger's \\"Nesher Quarry\\" project. In addition, he printed works for artists such as Michael Gross, Shmuel Katz, Zvi Mairovitch and others. From 1974 to 1982 he lived in New York, where he made a living by working in real estate, alongside his work as an artist in a workshop he opened with Arieh Moscovitch. David (Dedi) Ben Shaul, printed using lithograph technique, and Avishai Eyal, who worked primarily in the medium of etching, set up a separate studio in Jerusalem.Eyal was mainly engaged in experimental printing and in printing prints in small editions. See: Sanford Sivits Shaiman, Prints from the Avishay Ayal Etching workshop 1972-1975 (Haifa: University of Haifa, 1990); Gideon Ophrat, 100 Years of Print Art in Israel (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2015), p. 174. However, the establishment of the large workshops made the independent activities of these artists somewhat redundant. Itche Mambush founded another workshop in the 1960s in Ein Hod, directed by Ora Lahav Shaltiel. In 1972 Jacob Harel founded a commercial print workshop that would become Har-el Printers and Publishers. In 1974 the Jerusalem Print Workshop was established in Jerusalem. The workshop was established as a public benefit company and was initially associated with the Jerusalem Artists Association. In 1975, the Israel Museum set up another public print workshop - the Burston Graphics Center - in Hutzot Hayotzer.See: Meira Perry-Lehman, Curator, Israeli prints from the Burston Gallery, (Jerusalem:The Israel Museum, 1981). In addition, several other printing houses published in the field of artistic printing.See: Rachel Angel, \\"The Register - in Seventy Languages,\\" Maariv, 16 January 1976 An example of the rising popularity of the medium could be found in the activity of the Israeli Graphotek, which in 1978 had not yet opened its doors to the public, but had already collected about 1300 works by 105 different artists.Rachel Angel, \\"The Israeli Graphotec,\\" Maariv, 2 March 1979 By the 1990s, Graphotek had already collected about 4,000 works by about 200 artists and was accessible to the public in six centers around the country.See: The Graphotec Notebook, Alima File (Jerusalem: The Information Center for Israeli Art, The Israel Museum). In a 1975 list, Adam Baruch described the growing popularity of artistic prints during those years in Israel and around the world. Baruch distinguished between the reproduction of old works to the medium of the print, and works of art that made critical use of the various techniques of the medium.See: Adam Baruch, \\"The Israeli Print (Cut)\\" Musag [Concept], Issue No. 5, (October 1975), p 42. In addition, attempts were made to mount systematic displays of prints. In 1978, the exhibition \\"30 Israeli Artists: Artistic Prints\\" was presented at Tel Aviv University,See: Talia Rappaport, \\"50 years of prints,\\" Davar, 23 June 1978. and during the 1980s, attempts were made to establish a triennale for graphics at the Haifa Museum of Art. Many artists adopted the medium as another technique in their work, a technique of a more commercial nature. Usually prints were produced in editions of between 30 and 150 copies.The number of copies of the edition is dependent on technique. Silk prints or lithographs were printed in large editions. In some cases, about 250-300 copies were printed. Some of the works were intended for the international market, especially for the United States. In addition, various albums were also produced that combined 5-10 works by a single artistIgael Tumarkin , for example, who has created over 300 different prints, published several bound albums, including \\"Paraphrases on the Polyhedron\\" (1972), \\" Self Portrait 1975 \\" (1975) and \\" Battle of the Blind Men and the Sow- Heinrich von Kleist \\"(1979). or by a group of artists.Jerusalem Print Workshop , for example, printed in 1977 an album entitled \\"Jerusalem\\", with the prints of five artists ( Michael Gross ,Liliane Klapisch , Moshe Kupferman , Ivan Schwebel and Menashe Kadishman ), in an edition of 200 copies. This commercial development led several galleries to continuously produce series of prints for artists, which were printed in the various workshops. The major ones included the Bineth Gallery in Tel AvivProduced prints for artists such as Lillian Clapisch , Fima and others and the Engel GalleryProduced prints for artists such as Moshe Castel and Anna Ticho and others in Jerusalem. The popularity of the print also led to the printing of signed and numbered posters by artists or the production of prints based on the works of deceased artists, by inscribing their signature on the plate.See: Gad Ullman, \\"Gray Market Prints: Original Prints, Reproduction, and Everything in-between\\", Studio, Art Magazine, Issue No. 12 (June 1990), pp 4-7. Unlike most of the artists who worked in the field, in the 1970s and 1980s, a group of artists continued their avant-garde activities concerning everything related to the examination of the artistic object, including in the medium of print. Artists such as Buky Schwartz, Michael Gitlin, Benni Efrat, and others emphasized the plastic nature of the paper by using various artistic means such as repetition and seriality, or by emphasizing the print plate as an object, or by folding and distorting the paper. Pinchas Cohen Gan, for example, made use of plates printed on entire sheets of paper in 1980, leaving him with negatives. In the works of Menashe Kadishman (1983), the artist reconstructed his sculptural activities and converted them into the print media, creating a confrontation between nature and culture.See: Mordechai Omer, Tikkun (Tel Aviv: The Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery,1998), p 182. Also: Gideon Ofrat, 100 Years of Printmaking in Israel , Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, 2015 , pp. 187-186. A unique preoccupation with the surface of the print is also found in the works of Joyce Schmidt, who created prints using techniques of stress. Her paper-making business led her to make use of the paper produced by the business. From a technical point of view, the flourishing of lithography technique particularly stands out during this period. The main development of the technique in Israel during this period can be credited to the work of the Burston Graphic Center, which in its first year trained artists in this technique. Alima, who studied this technique at Burston, imported this printing technique to the print workshop at the Artists House in Tel Aviv and the College of Visual Arts in Beersheva. In her independent work she combined the technique of lithography with other techniques such as screen printing and etching. To a great extent, this technique died out in the early 1990s, with the closure of the Burston Center. In contrast to the lithography and etching techniques, the screen printing technique (or \\"silkscreen printing\\" as it was called at the time) was perceived as a secondary technique, mainly because it lacked any artistic tradition. Art in Israel began using industrial techniques in the late 1950s, but until the 1970s it was not widely used in art. As early as 1949, Ellie Gross (Yaari) lectured on serigraphy (screen printing) in the exhibition \\"What is Graphics?\\" In the Jerusalem Artists House. However, an early example of artistic use of the medium can be found in the book The Jerusalem Hills and all the Anguish (1967) by Malachi Beit-Arie published by Tarshish. The book was accompanied by screen prints created by Myriam Bat-Yosef and printed in a commercial printing press - \\"Herut Herut Printing Press\\".Ada Vardi, Spitzer: Chapters and Tarshish (Tel Aviv: Tarshish Publishing, 2015). The most significant development in the use of art technique can be attributed to Zvi Tolkovsky, who returned from art studies in the United States and learned the technique there. At the end of the sixties,Tolkovsky returned to Israel and, in 1969-1969, a workshop for printing and screen printing at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.Despite the influence of American art, the photograph was not perceived at the time as an independent artistic object, but mainly used as documentation of artistic activity. Tolkovsky also taught at the Artists House in Tel Aviv, where screen printing was used as part of a variety of techniques such as calligraphy. An expression of the ambivalent status of the screen print can be found in the work of Moshe Gershuni, who was commissioned to create a series of print works at the Jerusalem Print Workshop in 1984. Gershuni testified that he had a distaste for the print medium, \\"especially for screen printing, which in my opinion represented the most extreme form of graphic art.\\"Larry Abramson,, \\"A Conversation with Gershuni, \\" in Gershuni in the Jerusalem Print Workshop (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 1984, unnumbered pages. However, his works in this technique, including \\"Avinu Malkeinu\\" [Our Father,Our King] (1984), \\"Justice and Charity\\" (1984), and others, enjoyed both artistic and commercial success. However, the bulk of the prints were done using various etching techniques. These works were figurative in character and expressive in language. The works of artists such as Raanan Levy, Ofer Lellouche, Tamara Rickman, David Ben-Shaul, were drawings, created using traditional techniques as etching and aquatint. In addition, there were also artists who incorporated new techniques in their works, such as Uri Lifschitz, who combined in works such as \\"Mr. Rabinovich\\" (1968), etching with photographic etching. Yigal Tumarkin, for example, in the print \\"Pieta, Pierre Paolo Pasolini,\\" (1979). combined several print plates made using the technique of photographic etching, on which he combined drawing and dry etching. The plates were combined in a collage, cut and twisted to give them an expressive character and to create negative spaces in the composition. Artists such as Ivan Schwebel, Asaph Ben Menachem and Avraham Eilat, used this expressionism as an expression of symbolism or metaphysical content. In the famous series \\"Kaddish\\" (1984), for example, Moshe Gershuni created a tangle of symbols and images that expressed a complex position toward Judaism and the Jewish God. =1990-2010= Rose of Jericho (2003) by Larry Abramson. Soft-ground and spit-bite. Printed by the Jerusalem Print Workshop In the early 1990s, \\"new media art\\" began to develop, using visual images created by \\"technical reproduction\\"Digital media accompanied by a theoretical study which adopted the essay of Walter Benjamin \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction \\" (1936-1938) as a fundamental theoretical text. without the need to use a manual process of creating print plates and manual printing. The use of computer graphics and digital media, which developed during this period, completely replaced manual design. The use of these methods also led to the perception of the art print industry as archaic. This led to the closure and reduction of many print workshops during the 2000s. Among other things, the workshops of the Faculty of Arts - Hamidrasha at Beit Berl College were closed, and Bezalel's work was greatly reduced. The activities of professional workshops were also reduced, and they stopped producing works in large editions and went on to print works in editions of only 12-18 copies. The Burston Center workshop was closed in 1990 after management problems, while the Printmaking Workshop of Tel Aviv Artists House converted its services from printing whole editions to making available the possibility of independent activity and instruction in the use of various techniques. Most of institutionalized artistic activity took place at the Gottesman Etching Center, which was established at Kibbutz Cabri in 1993, at the Har-El Printers & Publishers print workshop in Tel Aviv-Jaffa and at the Jerusalem Print Workshop, which experienced a period of prosperity as a result of the workshop's activity, when it moved to a new business and artistic model in the mid-1980s. The shrinking of the field led most of the major artists who worked in the print industry, such as Ofer Lellouche, Larry Abramson, Sharon Poliakine, Asaf Ben Zvi, Hila Lulu Lin and others, to perceive the medium as secondary in their work. However, artists such as Orit Hofshi, Asaph Ben- Menahem and others have made it the primary medium in their work. An area that began to develop during this period is the production of \\"artists‚Äô books\\" - books that combined text - mostly poems - with prints created specifically for this book. Such books replaced folders of prints that artists had previously published as a portfolio. The books were printed in limited editions and numbered in etching or screen printing techniques. As early as the 1980s, the Jerusalem Print Workshop began printing such books. Among the best known are Thirteen Etchings for Poems by Haim Nachman Bialik (1987) by Moshe Gershuni, and in 1989 the workshop created a series of 9 artists‚Äô books in an edition of 40 copies each.See: Etchings of Songs: Nine Files of Etchings and Poems , on the Jerusalem Print Workshop site. Due to the high cost of producing such books, most of the works were printed for renowned artists.The works of the artist include Kaddish (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1997) by Moshe Gershuni , Death Fugue by Paul Celan (Jaffa: Har-El Printers and Publishers, 1995)) by Yigal Tumarkin (and other works he created in this workshop), the folder of prints of Ofer Lellouche from the Gottesman Etching Center, and \\"TheTrue Rose of Jericho\\" (Jerusalem: Jerusalem Print Workshop, 2003) by Larry Abramson . Although Israeli museums continued to purchase prints, exhibitions in major galleries in Tel Aviv-Jaffa or museum exhibitions of Israeli prints were unusual, and even the inclusion of prints in group thematic exhibitions was very small. In 1994, the Israel Museum mounted the exhibition,The Printer's Imprint: Twenty Years with the Jerusalem Print Workshop, Jerusalem, marking the 20th anniversary of the Jerusalem Print Workshop. Among the other museum exhibitions are Portfolios from the Gottesman Etching Center, Kibbutz Cabri (2006) at the Israel Museum, Etchings (2006) at the Negev Museum of Art and Print Time, Works from the Jerusalem Workshop and the Gottesman Center (2013) at the Open Museum, Tefen.

It consists of seven cantos, and of 7095 verses in all, in an Alexandrine-derived Metre ‚Äì a variant featuring 15 syllables rather than the usual 14.Canto 1 contains 831 verses; canto 2, 968; canto 3, 883; canto 4, 799; canto 5, 1236; canto 6, 1017; canto 7, 1361 The songs are inspired by major epics from world literature such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Aeneid, the Bible, the Ramayana, the Iliad, and by modern authors such as Papini, Asimov and others ‚Äì especially as far as the treatment of the primaeval flood is concerned. The book is contextualized by a foreword (by William Auld) and an afterword by Probal Dasgupta.  Content  It is already clear in the first canto that the history of human beings will be narrated in a symbolic mode; furthermore, the narration takes place from an outsider's viewpoint ‚Äì it is an extraterrestrial population that visits Earth and studies the behavior of Terrans. The extraterrestrials inquire whether the Terrans deserve to be helped to avoid an impending disaster or whether it is better for the extraterrestrials to wait for the destruction to happen in order to be able, afterwards, to colonize the planet for their own use. The main debate concerns the question as to whether the Terrans are rational or not, given their inclinations towards vengeance, hatred and mass murder. The conclusion reached is that the extraterrestrials must warn at least one Terran that he should build a large ship to survive the flood: the extraterrestrial Emme conveys this warning to Utnoa, a character corresponding to the mythical figure Noah. What follows, in the second canto, is the controversy between the two parties among the extraterrestrials. One of them has changed sides; he lived among the Terrans incognito for some time; his earth-born wife and son have been murdered. Now he and his supporters want this irrational species exterminated. On Earth, the rivalry between Babylon and Nineveh puts Utnoa in serious danger, for he is a nomad, caught in the cross-fire. Along with his brother Lashmu, he visits a Babylonian oracle to ask what the message communicated to Utnoa means. Meanwhile, the temple guards attached to the Ishtar Temple in Babylon (on the head priest's orders) launch a violent attack against the nomads; when Utnoa tells his people they need to build a ship, very few of them agree to do the work; most of them go off to fight the city-dwellers. The third canto depicts various aspects of the life of the extraterrestrial Nayans, focusing on a special intellectual game, a wedding, and other everyday practices that manifest a highly developed and articulated standard of collective living. Meanwhile, on Earth, Utnoa's followers have begun to build the ship, with support from Shabda, queen of Ur, but in the face of opposition from the humiliated general Ulmi, angered by a coincidental hunting accident. In the fourth canto, the extraterrestrials hostile to the Dilmunites (the nomads) hatch a conspiracy. Arunni feeds the prophetess Filge with thoughts against those building the ship. She passes them on to the queen, who ignores her, but what she says provokes general Ulmi even further. Afterward a deserter, Tudar, comes from the city to the shipbuilders and tells them, in detail, that the queen is dead and that there will be a major offensive against the Dilmunites very soon. In fact, even before he finishes telling them the whole story ‚Äì in a filmlike sequence ‚Äì General Ulmi, seeking revenge, launches the attack. Most of the shipbuilders are massacred: Lashmu, Utnoa's family, and others, including the deserter Tudar; and Ulmi, who led the offensive, is also killed. The fifth canto features another assembly of the Gobans (the extraterrestrials are from the planet Goba, destroyed when their sun went nova). In order to compensate for the hostile action by Arunni, it is agreed that Utnoa ‚Äì demoralized and relatively defenceless ‚Äì should be encouraged by using a drug called ano≈≠do. Inna visits Earth and administers it to Noah. Under the influence of the drug, he sees the poet Valmiki, who shows him the enormous achievements humankind will perform in future if he is able to save it; he travels from the Great Wall of China to the island of Sri Lanka; he then meets the Japanese painter Hokusai who proceeds to display other Asian wonders. Thus Utnoa is accompanied by two eminent guides per continent; for Europe, first Phidias and then Maria Sklodovska (also known as Marie Curie); for Africa, first Hypatia and then Sunjata Keita; and for America, first Frida Kahlo and then Neil Armstrong. On every continent, Utnoa contemplates the remarkable accomplishments, mainly but not exclusively architectural, which would render meaningful the heroic effort with his he is building the ark that is about to save human beings, who then be capable of the achievements that he is given an opportunity to visualize. His drug-induced travels through Oceania and Antarctica is quicker and unaccompanied. On his return, Utnoa leads the ceremonial mourning of his brother Lashmu ‚Äì who had been supervising the shipbuilding work ‚Äì and, to the reader's surprise, abandons the project and burns the partially built ship. In the sixth canto, both the extraterrestrials supporting Noah's community and those who disapprove of him are surprised to see that even after his illuminating travels into the future Utnoa should have chosen to burn the ship and to withdraw into the wilderness with the few survivors who were with him. A small group of those Dilmunites who had not been present arrive. Jubal tells Utnoa about the battles waged by the other Dilmunites, who had left and joined forces with other nomadic tribes to besiege Nineveh. Negotiations for peace failed; the ruler of Nineveh took many prisoners, including Ukud, the chief of the Leonite tribe; he had Ukud tortured and murdered. Some Leonites wanted to take revenge at once, while some of their allies preferred to wait for others and join forces; they failed to resolve this controversy. When the Leonites left, there was a terrible battle between the citizens of Nineveh and the nomadic combatants. Given their unequal strength, the nomads were routed. The few Dilmunites who survived the massacre realized that it had been a mistake not to have agreed to take part in building the ship; they would like to reconsider. This was why Jubal came back in order to tell Utnoa and others what had happened. The seventh canto ends the epic. The Dilmunites pick up the pieces and, in their camp, put their life back together as best they can. Noah gets engaged and marries; they receive what they take to be divine signals, which prompt them to start building the ship at the city of Eridu. The extraterrestrial Gobans react again: Jishka administers a drug to Utnoa, whose visions this time are guided by the extraterrestrial Roa Numu. He is now shown future evils that will come to pass if he does indeed rescue humankind ‚Äì evils such as corruption, rapacity, drug dealing, organized crime, all the way to the bombing of Hiroshima as well as the environmental disaster and pollution associated with non-human causes. There are references to individualism, dictatorship and Nazism. After he comes out of the dream, Utnoa forgets the vision of future evils, which he attributes to some unconscious factors. The closing lines of the epic are open-ended: the impression is given that the ship will indeed be built. The reader already knows the Biblical legend and is spared an explicit repetition.  Style  The verses are of fifteen syllables, a rare format in modern poetry, but long verses go well with the epic genre and were used in several classical epics. The text pays frequent homage to those epics; for example, the second canto begins with the line \\"When rosy-fingered dawn ushered in the sun\\", invoking Homer's metaphor for dawn. In order to keep the archaic style from obstructing the reader, vivid comparisons (involving the dynamics of the animal kingdom) are added; these place the narration in an ecological context: Like a lion that ..., Like a rhinoceros that ... Probal Dasgupto in his afterword calls them ‚ÄòAbelian comparisons‚Äô and studies their systematic use by Montagut.Abel Montagut, Poemo de Utnoa. Pro Esperanto. Vienna, 1993. . 225 p. The text also features occasional detailed explanations of the various elements of the whole, such as the attractions of the city of Babylon. The metrical structure that lends fluency to these descriptions also endows with a certain majesty the few epigrammatic expressions of conventional sentiments, such as Hazardo suverenas sur nia mondo drakone, ‚ÄòIt is Chance that holds draconian sway over our world‚Äô.Page 188, v 910.  Message  At the level of content, we must emphasize that this text recontextualizes the familiar myth of a primaeval flood with fabulations about life on other planets; such inventions typically flourish in writing that draws on pseudo-science and does not aim for serious literary goals; here, however, the memes serve the fictive-literary purposes of this particular epic. Concerning ideology, the author uses every opportunity to show why these aliens in general and certain terrestrial humans in particular are committed to peaceful practices and the avoidance of violence. The aliens are of course shown using scientific progress in order to enjoy a high standard of living. The inventions that the aliens use reminds us of science fiction films. This text uses the extraterrestrial trope in order to communicate a contemporary message urging readers to aspire to a highly articulated, humane form of life. This is how Numu speaks, for instance: \\"I am a rational being from a civilization far more advanced. We have resources at our disposal that you can‚Äôt imagine, and we are thus able to explore the universe at far more depth and gain insight\\"Page 178, vv 528-531. The use of extraterrestrials is a trope that elicits the modern reader's complicity; its purpose is to take over the functions that divine interventions performed in the classical epics. From the perspective of the Dilmunites (the nomadic tribe led by Utnoa), it makes sense to obey what they interpret as signals or messages from the gods. The modern reader understands that the sources of those signals or messages are most often the extraterrestrials, who are to be seen only as rational persons culturally advanced in comparison to the nomadic Dilmunites. Of course the Dilmunites are justified in attributing to their gods what we would call natural disasters; and we must bear in mind that the story turns on an impending natural disaster ‚Äì a flood, in the terms that Terrans understand, caused by the approaching meteorite, which only the extraterrestrials can conceptualize. The repeated references to the impending disaster are in keeping with the on the whole sombre mood of the text (especially in the seventh canto), a mood that reflects the modern reader's perception of Noah's predicament. In this connection, let us quote Numu Roa again ‚Äì this is how he presents one part of the terrible images that Utnoa is shown: \\"Here are those who will kill their own father, their mother, their wife, or even their own infants in their cradles. Look at those kidnappers, those who don‚Äôt balk at assaulting women and innocent children to satisfy that perverted lust of theirs. And these are the worst criminals that humankind will produce, they will kill other people as easily as they breathe in or out: feeling-blind mafiosi who should be buried in unremembered tombs without a name: it would have been better if no womb had ever given them birth\\"Page 178, vv 528-531. The trope of exodus, on which Dilmunites are shown as having pinned their hopes, is associated with the non-violent inclination for peaceful coexistence of all communities and an aversion for military aggression and destructiveness. They believe that if they live in accordance with their non-violent principles, then they will reach the mythical promised land, Dilmun; this destination that the nomads long for is an island symbolically comparable to the realm to which Don Quixote promises to take Sancho if he behaves ‚Äì the √≠nsula Bararataria ‚Äì despite the considerable differences between the two texts.

She made one voyage from Calcutta to Port Jackson and was lost in 1812 off Sumatra while on a second voyage from Calcutta to Port Jackson. Origins Mangalores origins are currently obscure.

Nor does her year or place of launch appear in Phipp's (1840) book, which has the most complete list of vessels launched at the various ship-building sites in the Bay of Bengal. Currently the best estimate is that she was built circa 1811 on the west coast of India, possibly at Mangalore.

It runs west of the Englischer Garten from Dillisstra√üe, or the Nikolaiplatz to the corner of Mandlstra√üe/K√∂niginstra√üe, and forms the southern edge of the heritage- protected building ensemble Alt-Schwabing. The name of the street came from Maria Josepha of Portugal, the second wife of Karl Theodor, Duke in Bavaria. The renaming of the street from its originally name, Wiesenstra√üe, took place in the course of 1891 and was carried out with the incorporation of Schwabing to Munich. Countless streets of the Altschwabinger village center were then given new addresses and names. According to Rambaldi, the street name assignments were officially carried out as early as 1890, and for the postal detection of the buildings along this road, the name had been recognized since 12 November 1892. On city maps from the years 1890 and 1891, the street name was not yet to be found. At the beginning of Maria-Josepha-Stra√üe is the Seidlvilla (also called Villa Lautenbacher), built in 1905 by Emanuel von Seidl in the style of German Renaissance with Art Nouveau forms. On the Nikolaiplatz is the 1928-1929 designed Fischerbrunnen by Eugen Mayer-Fassold. At the corner Kaulbach Stra√üe and Maria-Josepha- Stra√üe is a former publishing house of the Bayerischen Telefonbuchverlag (Bavarian telephone book publisher) from the 1950s, which is to be replaced by a complex building with 28 apartments, offices and practices. Further along the street is an office building of Munich Re, which was completed in March 2013 and whose construction was very controversial. Until the 1960s, the then tram line 22, drove to Schwabing and turned in a loop at Nikolaiplatz. In the curve between the Maria-Josepha-Stra√üe and the Nikolaiplatz, the tram tracks are still visible through holes in the pavement and through the cooling of the asphalt. From here, tracks were also laid for a possible connection through the Englischer Garten. With the postal address Nikolaiplatz 1b, which is also on the Maria-Josepha-Stra√üe Seidlvilla, as well as the Fischerbrunnen also counted, there are only 9 historically listed buildings on the only 260 m long road, which is also included in the Ensemble protection Altschwabing.

His offices included Auditor General of the Apostolic Camera, Protonotary Apostolic, 'ponente' of the Sacra Consulta, referendary of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and canon of St John Lateran. Pope Innocent X made him a cardinal in the consistory of 2 March 1654 and he took part in the papal conclave the following year. He died in Rome and was buried in the family tomb in Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He left his entire estate to the sacristy of St Peter's Basilica, of which he had been a canon.

A park conservancy is a type of private, non-profit organization in the United States, that can support the maintenance, capital development, and advocacy for parks or park systems. These organizations raise money through a variety of means to care for urban parks, and while there is not a single model for how a park conservancy can or should be developed, they are created to meet the needs of local communities based on their resources and political situations.  Park conservancy development  Park conservancies developed in relation to what some call a fifth model for parks, namely those that are sustainable in plantings, usage, and funding. This arose in part due to a lack of public funding allocation for parks, along with structure that allowed the members of the community to directly support their own parks. The number of parks conservancies has grown in the past decades as city funding for parks has in many cases declined, playing an increasingly prominent role in urban parks. One particular aspect of them involves their management, which is independent of local municipal elections. They generally take a long-term perspective on parks, and as a result are financially focused on long-term sustainability to meet their management needs. While the Central Park Conservancy is often considered the first of its kind, they remain different than Friends of the Park groups, Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), and most conservancies in California (where conservancies are often names of state agencies).  Controversies  While park conservancies are increasingly relied upon to manage, fund, and care for urban parks, they are not without controversy. Some claim that their popularity encourages government to step back from their responsibilities to fund public spaces, and the more they give away their authority the less public oversight exists. Along these lines, funding decisions increasingly depend upon fund-raising, leading to potential conflicts with wealthy donors influencing decisions that affect the rights of those who are often poorest and in most need of the parks themselves.  Prominent park conservancies  While New York City has the most conservancies of any American city, conservancy management and care of large and small urban parks can be found across the country. One size or approach to developing or using park conservancies will not be the same everywhere based on size or funding, Some of these include: * Abingdon Square Park, New York, NY * Balboa Park, San Francisco, CA * Golden Gate National Parks (GGNRA), San Francisco Bay Area, CA * Brooklyn Bridge Park, Brooklyn, NY * Central Park Conservancy, New York, NY * The High Line, New York, NY * Forest Park, St. Louis, MO * Millennium Park, Chicago, IL * Piedmont Park, Atlanta, GA * Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh, PA * Overton Park Conservancy Memphis, TN * Shelby Farms Park Conservancy, Memphis, TN * Memphis River Parks Partnership, Memphis, TN  References  Category:Parks in the United States Category:Organizations based in the United States ","title":"Park conservancy"},{"id":"57241310","text":"Rajesh Kumar Sharma (born 2 November 1978) is an Indian politician belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who currently serves as the Health Minister, Bihar.

Description and history The Bushnell-Dickinson House is located in a residential area in western Old Saybrook, on the south side of Old Post Road, between Meadowood Lane and the current alignment of the Boston Post Road (United States Route 1). It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by fluted pilasters and topped by a four-light transom window. Three shed-roof dormers project slightly from the steep face of the roof. The interior follows a typical center chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule with a window staircase, parlor and hall on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen at the rear, with small chambers in each of the rear corners. The interior retains original wide pine floors, paneled walls, wainscoting, and original door latches and mounting hardware. The house was built about 1790 by Phineas Bushnell, descended from one of the area's early settlers. The house stands on what was, until about 1800, the main east-west road through Old Saybrook. The house remained in the hands of Bushnell's descendants (who married into the locally politically prominent Dickinson family) until 1934. It was given a thorough but sympathetic restoration in 1958, which included the use of hand-forged reproduction hardware in some places.

A total of seven vessels were built to three designs: two s, four s, and , a modified version of the Trento design. The Regia Marina had initially intended to build six cruisers, which would operate as two three-ship divisions, but of the Zara class was used as the fleet flagship while the s were being rebuilt, so a seventh ship was ordered. The seven ships represented disagreements within the naval high command, with one faction favoring high speed at the expense of armor protection (which resulted in the Trentos and Bolzano) and another that preferred heavier armor in exchange for a reduced top speed (which produced the Zaras). All of the ships were officially built to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, namely a standard displacement of and an armament of main guns, though they all exceeded the displacement limit. All seven ships saw extensive service in the Mediterranean Sea during World War II, where they repeatedly engaged elements of the British Royal Navy. Italian heavy cruisers took part in the Battles of Calabria, Taranto, Cape Spartivento, Cape Matapan, First and Second Sirte between 1940 and 1943. Three of the Zaras‚Äî, , and Pola‚Äîwere sunk in a close-range night action with British battleships at the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941, Trento was torpedoed and sunk by British forces in June 1942, and Bolzano was badly damaged by a British submarine in August 1942, which left her out of action for the rest of the war. United States heavy bombers raided La Maddalena in April 1943, sinking Trieste and badly damaging Gorizia; the latter vessel and Bolzano were later attacked by Italian commandos while Italy was under German occupation in 1944 to prevent the Germans from repairing and reactivating them. They were both raised and scrapped after the war. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The maximum thickness of the armored belt - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed/horsepower generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel assembly commenced - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ Trento class Trento early in her career The Trento-class cruisers were ordered in 1924 in response to the French cruisers of the , begun that year. The Italian naval high command requested that the proposed cruisers have a very high top speed of ; the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty limited the standard displacement of new cruisers to and their main armament to guns. To keep the design under the limit while achieving the speeds requested by the high command, the design staff was forced to drastically reduce the scale of armor protection. Their weak armor led officers in the Regia Marina to demand better-protected vessels for the next class of cruiser to be built. Ironically, the high speeds attained by Trento and Trieste could only be reached on very light displacements and in service, they could only manage around , the same speed as the sturdier Zaras.Brescia, pp. 72, 74Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 291-292 After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, Trento and Trieste saw extensive action against British forces in the Mediterranean Sea, including at the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan in July and November 1940 and March 1941, respectively.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 2-3, 11 In November 1941, Trieste was torpedoed by the submarine ; she spent most of the next year under repair. In the meantime, Trento was also present during the inconclusive First and Second Battles of Sirte. The Italian fleet sortied to attack the British Operation Harpoon convoy in June 1942, and while on the way, Trento was torpedoed twice, first by a Bristol Beaufighter torpedo bomber and then sunk by the submarine with very heavy loss of life on 15 June. Trieste was moved to La Maddalena, Sardinia, where she was later sunk by United States heavy bombers on 10 April 1943.Hogg & Wiper, p. 3, 10-11 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Trento class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  8 √ó / 50 caliber gunsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 291  rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  4 shafts, Parsons turbines, ,  8 February 1925  3 April 1929  Sunk, 15 June 1942 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  22 June 1925  21 December 1928  Sunk, 10 April 1943 } Zara class Zara in the 1930s While the Trentos were still under construction, elements of the Italian naval command began to doubt the effectiveness of the new vessels, which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds. They advocated a more balanced design that would incorporate more comprehensive armor, while retaining the battery of eight 203 mm guns and a speed of at least . To accomplish these goals, the high command permitted the designers to exceed the 10,000-ton limit, and instructed them to adopt as many weight-saving changes as possible. These included using a light weight propulsion system, removing torpedo tubes from the design, and abandoning the flush deck of the Trentos in favor of a stepped down main deck.Brescia, p. 76 The heavy armor of the Zaras made them the best-protected cruisers built by any navy until the United States' , laid down in 1945.Martin, p. 69 The four ships all saw action at Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan; at the last engagement, Pola was disabled by a torpedo from a Swordfish torpedo bomber launched by the British aircraft carrier ; Zara and Fiume were detached from the rest of the fleet to protect Pola, and all three and a pair of destroyers were sunk in a close-range night engagement with the battleships , , and . Gorizia, the sole surviving member of the class, saw action at the First and Second Battles of Sirte in December 1941 and March 1942, respectively. While the ship was moored in La Maddalena on 10 April 1943, a major attack from United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers sank Trieste and hit Gorizia with three bombs, inflicting serious damage. She was still under repair in La Spezia when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September, and she was seized by German forces when they occupied much of the country. On 22 June 1944, Italian frogmen used Chariot manned torpedoes to enter the harbor and sink Gorizia, though Gorizia survived the attack. She was ultimately sold for scrap in 1949.Hogg & Wiper, pp. 18, 24, 46‚Äì47, 54Greene & Massignani, pp. 218-221 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Zara class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\"  8 √ó 203 mm / 53 cal. gunsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 292  rowspan=\\"4\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\"  2 shafts, Parsons turbines, ,  4 July 1929  20 October 1931  Sunk, 29 March 1941 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  29 April 1929  23 November 1931  Sunk, 29 March 1941 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  17 March 1931  21 December 1932  Sunk, 29 March 1941 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  17 March 1930  23 December 1932  Disabled by manned torpedoes in 1944, scrapped in 1949 } Bolzano Bolzano during peacetime By 1928, the Italian navy had begun rebuilding the s, and as a result, Pola was completed with an enlarged bridge so she could temporarily serve as the fleet flagship. She would then be unavailable for the planned three-ship cruiser divisions, and so the navy ordered a seventh cruiser to replace Pola. The design requirements for the new vessel reverted to those adopted for the Trentos, as the senior leaders of the navy continued to believe that speed was more important than armor. A series of changes were made to the basic Trento design, including the use of the longer 53-cal. guns adopted for the Zaras, new boilers, and a raised forecastle deck.Brescia, p. 80 Like the rest of the Italian heavy cruisers, Bolzano was present at the major fleet actions during the first two years of the war in the Mediterranean. She was lightly damaged at Calabria and she engaged the British battlecruiser at Cape Spartivento, though neither vessel scored any hits. While returning from a failed attempt to intercept a British convoy in August 1941, Bolzano was torpedoed by the British submarine . Repairs were completed by November, but she was torpedoed again in August 1942 by the submarine , sustaining serious damage. She was still out of service in La Spezia, awaiting repairs, when Italy surrendered to the Allies on 3 September 1943; on 8-9 September, German troops occupied La Spezia. On the night of 21-22 June 1944, a team of British and Italian frogmen Italy having re-entered the war on the side of the Alliesentered La Spezia using Chariot manned torpedoes to sink Bolzano and Gorizia to prevent the Germans from sinking them as blockships. They succeeded in sinking Bolzano but Gorizia remained afloat. Bolzano was ultimately raised in 1949 and thereafter broken up.Hogg & Wiper, p. 62Brescia, pp. 80‚Äì81 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Bolzano class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  8 √ó 203 mm / 53 cal. gunsGardiner & Chesneau, p. 293  70 mm  4 shafts, Parsons turbines, 36 knots, 150,000 shp  11 June 1930  19 August 1933  Sunk, 21 June 1944 } See also *List of protected cruisers of Italy *List of battleships of Italy Notes References   * Italy Heavy ","title":"List of heavy cruisers of Italy"},{"id":"57241539","text":"Oxley County NSW.

Early life Spiegel was born in Kosche, Czechoslovakia on April 16, 1946 to Abraham and Edita Spiegel; his family immigrated to the United States th in 1948. His parents, Abraham and Edita Spiegel, had been imprisoned in Auschwitz in 1944. Their 2-year-old son, Uziel, was killed in the Holocaust. Spiegel attended Third Street School, John Burroughs Junior High School, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1963. He earned a bachelor's degree in business in 196 from the University of Southern California. He also attended Loyola Law School for one year. Spiegel worked for both A.G. Becker & Co. and Drexel Burnham as a stock broker through 1973.  Columbia Savings and Loan  Spiegel's father, Abraham Spiegel, bought a 50 percent interest in Eastland Savings & Loan, located in Anaheim, California. He later changed the name of the company to Columbia Savings & Loan. Columbia's headquarters was located in Beverly Hills. Spiegel became President and CEO in 1977. Forbes Magazine rated Columbia as the number one savings and loan in the US based on return on equity and return on assets.Forbes Magazine. 1984-11-09. Page 207. It was considered one of the country's most profitable savings and loans for years. At one point, Spiegel family members together owned about half of the stock in Columbia, which was worth around $350 million. Columbia's business strategy was to be a leader in the high yield bond market in terms of understanding credit and risk and in the residential lending market, Columbia was a leader on lending on high end residential properties. Columbia became one of Drexel Burnham‚Äôs largest clients in funding leveraged buyouts in the 80s. Spiegel resigned as Chairman & CEO of Columbia in 1989 after the government targeted him because he was in charge of one of the leading financial institutions in the US doing business with Drexel Burnham.  Federal case  In June 1990, federal regulators (specifically, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which is the primary regulator of the thrift industry) sued Spiegel seeking $40 million for \\"self-dealing, breach of fiduciary duty and unsafe and unsound practices in his management of Columbia.\\" The charges arose from Columbia‚Äôs loans to a luxury auto dealership that went sour at a cost of more than $5 million, the construction of a lavish headquarters that regulators sold at a loss of more than $20 million, Spiegel‚Äôs receipt of a $3-million bonus in 1989 and his alleged use of company funds for personal airplane travel, a gun collection and furnishings for a $1-million Palm Springs condominium. Spiegel issued a statement at the time saying he \\"forcefully denied all the charges\\" and \\"expressed outrage\\" at what he called \\"trial by press release.‚Äù Spiegel said, \\"For purely political reasons, OTS is seeking scapegoats to divert public attention from its gross incompetence.‚Äù Spiegel's official trial began on January 11, 1994. The trial, which took place in a U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and lasted seven weeks ending the saga of one of the most prominent thrift failures of the past decade. In the end, the government fined Spiegel $275,000. The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"In a significant concession, the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision also dropped its demand that Spiegel be banned from the banking and thrift industry. Spiegel, in exchange, dropped his claims of $1.9 million in back pay and legal expenses against the government.\\" At the time, federal authorities acknowledged that their civil case was weakened by Spiegel's acquittal on criminal charges. > \\"The terms of Friday's settlement, taken alongside the criminal acquittal, > call into question what the government has to show for its five-year pursuit > of Spiegel, which a Wall Street Journal editorial once referred to as the > case of \\"U.S. vs. the 1980s.\\" The government has been criticized for its > management of the financial crisis that engulfed the savings and loan > industry beginning in the late 1980s.\\" - The Los Angeles Times (2/25/95) Investments He was a significant shareholder and member of the board of PortalPlayer, a supplier of digital and audio technology platforms for consumer electronics.

The film features newcomer Amaran and Payal in the lead roles, with Ilavarasu, Kovai Desingu, Kuyili, Srinivasa Gurukkal, Lalitha Mani and Master Ashwin playing supporting roles. The film, produced by S. A. Jalavudhin, had musical score by Arafin Yusuf and was released in 2006. The film got a subsidy from the Government of Tamil Nadu for making a quality budget Tamil film and for releasing it under a Tamil title. Plot Mukhil (Amaran), an army officer, returns to his village for his holidays. Upon his return, he meets the bubbly girl Indhu (Payal) who seems to be mentally ill. Mukhil lives with his widow mother Chellamma (Kuyili) and his immature uncle Yedhukku (Ilavarasu). One day, Mukhil saves Indhu who was sexually harassed by some rowdies and he beats them up. Mukhil starts having suspicions about the way Indhu was behaving, so one day, he forcibly kisses her on the mouth to see her reaction. Indhu scolds him for behaving like that and spits on his face. Indhu belongs to a poor family, she lives with her sick grandmother and her little brother Suresh. Mukhil then apologizes for his disgusting act to Indhu and he professes his love to her but she doesn't respond. Mukhil was so desperate to figure out why Indhu is acting like a mentally ill person, so he asks her to tell him the whole story the next day otherwise he will consider suicide. The next day, Indhu's grandmother dies, therefore, she could not meet Mukhil, so Mukhil attempts to commit suicide but the villagers save him. Later, Indhu accepts his love and reveals to the villagers that she is not mentally ill. A few years ago, Indhu witnessed a government official being killed by the village bigwig Malayandi (Kovai Desingu). In the past, she was born to a devadasi (prostitute) and her mother died during childbirth. As per the village custom, Indhu must be brought up by a Brahmin family and at the age of majority, she had to become a devadasi. Seenu (Srinivasa Gurukkal) adopted her but when she hit puberty, he refused his daughter to be a devadasi. Seenu knew that he could not change his daughter's faith so he chose to commit suicide. Since that day, Indhu has to act like a mentally ill person to not become a devadasi. The village court decides to send Indhu to Malayandi's village. Malayandi plans to get married with Indhu thus she will become a devadasi. Chellamma then orders her son to save his lover from this evil practice. Mukhil enters their village and fights with Malayandi's henchmen, during the fight, Mukhil was deeply wounded by the henchmen. He manages to knock Malayandi out and stops the wedding, he then advises the villagers to abolish this ancestral practice. Malayandi asks for forgiveness and he decides to become a good man. The film ends with Mukhil and Indhu leaving Malayandi's village hand in hand.

As of 1995 she was living in Berlin.  Biography  Nourida Gadirova Ateshi was born in 1965 in the village Khachmaz in the district of Oƒüuz, a region in the Caucasian mountains in the northern part of Azerbaijan. She began writing poetry at the age of nine. She graduated with distinction from the College of Culture and Education as well as from the University of Culture and Art in Baku. Before completing her studies and receiving the degree of a Cultural Scientist and Sociologist, she participated in various radio and television programs. Due to her open and direct language, her liberal and democratic orientation, and her socio-critical approach her works have been banned from publishing for ten years in the Soviet time. Hence, she decided to adopt the penname ‚ÄúAteshi‚Äù (‚Äúthe Fiery‚Äù). In 1995 she moved to Berlin. She has also worked as a moderator in cultural programs with several TV and radio stations in Germany as well as a journalist for a number of Azerbaijani and Turkish media. She worked as an editor and editorial head of scientific and cultural publications in various publishing houses and magazines in Berlin (Hitit, ‚ÄúNew Bridge‚Äù), Baku (Zerkalo / Ayna), and in some other Azerbaijani and Turkish media from 1995 until 2015. At the same time she pursued her academic education; in 2002 she was awarded a doctorate degree by the Moscow State University of Culture and Arts (faculty of educational sciences). In 2003 her book Unlived Womanhood was published in Azerbaijani. In July 2003 Ateshi received Azerbaijan's highest award for media and literature, the ‚ÄúGolden Feather‚Äù. Having passed the exam in history with the mark ‚Äúmagna cum laude‚Äù at the State Examination Board of the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences and being bestowed with the postdoctoral qualification in history, she changed her professional and scientific orientation to History and Archaeology.  Scientific studies  She is focusing on scientifically investigating the prehistory and early history of the Caucasus. Within the scope of her work as a volunteer at the Museum for Culture and Art in Baku between 1989 and 1995 she dealt with historical issues and became acquainted with the structures and organization of scientific exhibitions in museums in practice. In 1997 Ateshi started her own scientific investigations of the prehistory and early history of the Caucasus and of ancient graves of armed women. Her research focuses mainly upon the archaeology of the Caucasus during the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. She is actively investigating the Khojaly-Gedebey-culture in the southern Caucasus, the historiography of the archaeology of the Caucasus, the Caucasus collections in European Museums, and ancient graves of armed women in the Caucasus. In 2012 she was accepted as a candidate for habilitation (‚Äúdoctor nauk‚Äù) at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Azerbaijani National Academy of Sciences. The results of her scientific research carried out for more than 15 years will be included in a thesis under the title ‚ÄúThe Place of Women in the Society and Women Warriors in the 3.-1. Millennium B.C. in the Caucasus (according to archaeological materials)‚Äù. At the end of 2011 she published a book in Berlin about the Caucasian Amazons in four languages (German, English, Russian and Azerbaijani) edited by the Azerbaijani National Academy of Sciences, providing an overview of the results of her research obtained so far. In 2014 she became the Director of the Institute for Caucasus Research in Berlin, formerly known as the Genjevi Institute of Azerbaijani Culture which she chaired from 2003 until 2014.

It collected all the achievements of microelectronics in the 1970s. The main task of the MIR-3 computer was to solve computational problems for engineers. MIR-3 consisted of keyboard, TV (display), a means of reading magnetic tapes and disks, a processor. The size of MIR-3 has decreased. Now it was the size of a regular desk. True, the size was without the means of reading magnetic tapes and disks. The speed of the MIR-3 computer was 10 5 - 10 7 actions per second. The memory capacity was up to 10 6 knocks. Essentially, the MIR-3 computer consisted of several computers. The microprocessor consists of several processors, each of which was responsible for the operation of a separate MIR-3 unit. For example, one for reading information from magnetic tapes and transferring information, the other for processing and calculations, the third for printing on the keyboard, and so on. The complex structure of MIR-3 required the creation of means for coordinating the work of individual computer parts. When creating the charter, the language Analitik-74 was used.

Bipolar disorder has a one percent prevalence rate in the United States and secondary mania is likely a small subset of that percentage. Secondary mania exhibits symptoms similar to that of mania in bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. This includes an elevated mood or affect, psychotic state, accelerated speech, increased motor activity, irritability, and flight ideas. A unique criterion for secondary mania is the lack of history of mental illness that causes mania, such as bipolar disorder.Krauthammer, C. (1978). Secondary Mania. Archives of General Psychiatry, 35(11), 1333. doi:10.1001/archpsyc.1978.01770350059005. Unlike bipolar disorder, which has an average age of onset at 25 years, secondary mania has an average age of onset at 45 years. Little is known about secondary mania, as much of the research on it is case studies and retrospective accounts. However, it has been connected to several causes such as traumatic brain injury, HIV/AIDS, and stroke.Evans, D. L., Byerly, M. J., & Greer, R. A. (1995). Secondary mania: diagnosis and treatment. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 56, 31-37. Closed-head injury One of the primary documented causes of secondary mania is traumatic brain injury, also called closed-head injury. For example, Jorge and colleagues examined the effects of traumatic brain injury and its correlation with secondary mania. They collected participants that in the previous year had had traumatic brain injuries. They did 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups with the patients where they took psychiatric interviews to measure impairment of daily life, intellectual, and social function. Within the 9% of patients that met the criteria for secondary mania, a correlation between secondary mania and temporal basal polar lesion was found. On average, the duration of secondary mania was 2 months.Jorge, R., Robinson, R., Starkstein, S., Arndt, S., Forrester, A., & Geisler, F. (1994). Secondary mania following traumatic brain injury. Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, 9(1), 107-108. doi:10.1097/00001199-199403000-00014. A second study found that out of 66 patients with a closed head injury, 9% experienced mania during the 12-month period after their injury. In a case study a 24-year-old man complained of symptoms of mania. He had no prior mental health issues, no family history for mental health disorders, and no history of substance abuse. After a medical examination, he was diagnosed with mania and psychotic symptoms. Soon after he reported having a severe headache and after examination it was found he had a heterogeneous lesion covering most of his left thalamus. After the lesion was discovered, his diagnosis was revised to be \\"organic mood disorder (left cerebral AVM, Arteriovenous malformation, with secondary mania)\\".Dhandapani, V. R. (2016). Organic mania secondary to left arteriovenous malformation. Asian Journal of Psychiatry, 22, 81-82. doi:10.1016/j.ajp.2016.05.003. Another study by Jorge and colleagues looked at the effects of traumatic brain injury and its correlation with secondary mania. HIV/AIDS Secondary mania has been associated with HIV/AIDS in a number of cases. According to Ellen and colleagues, secondary mania is reported in 1.2% of HIV-positive patients and 4.3% positive in those with AIDS.Ellen, S., Mijch, A., Cockram, A., Crowe, S., & Judd, F. (1999). Mania secondary to HIV infection. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 353-360. doi:10.1016/0924-977x(96)87335-4 In one case study by Chou and colleagues, a 78-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for manic symptoms. \\"The symptoms included decreased sleep, elevated mood, increased energy, hyperactivity, racing thoughts, and eccentric behavior\\". The patient had no prior history of mental health problems in his family or his own medical records. He was temporarily diagnosed with bipolar one. It was later discovered that he suffered from HIV/AIDs and his diagnosis was altered to secondary mania.Chou, P., Ouyang, W., Lan, T., & Chan, C. (2015). Secondary mania due to AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis in a 78-year-old patient. Psychogeriatrics, 16(2), 135-138. doi:10.1111/psyg.12127. Drugs Many drugs have direct or indirect effects on neurotransmitters. Steroids are especially proficient at causing changes to the chemistry of neurotransmitters. In a study, 40 women were given steroids to help with their rheumatoid arthritis. Three subjects developed manic symptoms within the first week of taking the steroid. Two had never had a diagnosis of a mental illness, and one of the three women was noted to be \\"emotionally labile\\" and had had a suicide attempt but no hospitalization. It was noted that the mania was not caused by an electrolyte imbalance, but the exact cause was uncertain. According to Ogawa and Ueki, secondary mania has also been associated with caffeine consumption. A 43-year-old man, with no prior history of mental illness, reportedly switched to drinking 10 cups of coffee a day. After consuming this amount, he was reported to have manic symptoms such as elevated mood, talkativeness, hyperactivity, grandiosity, flight of ideas, and insomnia. This led to his admission into a hospital. After examination, they removed caffeine from the man's diet, resulting in the cessation of manic symptoms. The doctors then concluded that either the caffeine had acted as a catalyst for bipolar disorder or that he had secondary mania. Unfortunately, little research is done on studying the interaction between mood disorders and caffeine.Ogawa, N., & Ueki, H. (2003). Secondary mania caused by caffeine. General Hospital Psychiatry, 25(2), 138-139. doi:10.1016/s0163-8343(02)00273-6. Other A case study by Liang and Yang was of a 75-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with fever, chills, headache, and vomiting. Upon doing a mental test, they discovered she had symptoms of mania. However, she had no prior history of mental illness. When speaking with the family they discovered that the symptoms had manifested two weeks prior. Eventually, she was diagnosed with enterococcal meningitis for her physical symptoms and secondary mania for her psychological symptoms. The study stated that the exact link between the secondary mania and the enterococcal meningitis is unknown.Liang, C., & Yang, F. (2011). Secondary mania associated with enterococcal meningitis in an elderly patient. General Hospital Psychiatry, 33(3). doi:10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.11.002. Controversy Since its first discovery over 30 years ago, secondary mania has been difficult to conceptualize. The primary arguments regarding its etiology are: (1) secondary mania is a form of toxic psychosis rather than actual mania, and (2) secondary mania is really latent bipolar disorder that happened to coincide with an injury. Toxic psychosis is a state which is caused by substance abuse; this could mean being in a confused state from the substance. The main argument against this theory is that mania in general has toxic origins and secondary mania is no different in this regard. However, analyses of secondary mania tend to exclude cases in which the person experienced high levels of confusion. Therefore, stating that it is a toxic state does not take away from the validity of its existence as long as the cases of secondary mania are narrowed to those without the confused state. The second argument is harder to dispute, as it is possible that secondary mania is late-onset bipolar disorder. The way this claim is disputed is through looking at the history of the patient. They check to see if there is a negative pre-morbid history, a lack of history of mental illness, age of onset, and the close proximity of the organic trauma to the mania.

Through each of these agreements, the consortium aims to secure immediate open access publication of all new research articles by authors from German institutions, permanent full-text access to the publisher‚Äôs complete journal portfolio, and fair pricing for these services according to a simple cost model based on the number of articles published. Publish and read model The publish and read (PAR) cost model introduced with Projekt DEAL‚Äôs transformative agreements replaces the lump-sum payments of subscriptions with per-article fees and brings hybrid open access publishing fees into check under a central agreement administered by institutions. The per-article PAR fee differs from the article processing charge (the standard article fee in gold open access journals) because it simultaneously covers the publication of a single article and the institutional costs for unrestricted reading access to the journals covered in the agreement. Negotiations with companies =With Elsevier= Negotiations between Projekt DEAL and Elsevier started in 2016. No agreement could be reached on a new model under the terms of Projekt DEAL, and the negotiations were officially called off in July 2018. In support of Projekt DEAL‚Äôs mandate to negotiate centrally, ca. 200 German Universities did not renew their expiring individual contracts with Elsevier starting January 2017. Dozens of German researchers resigned from their editor roles for Elsevier journals to strengthen Projekt DEAL‚Äôs push for open access. =With Wiley= On 15 January 2019, Projekt DEAL signed a 3-year contract with Wiley according to which researchers at more than 700 German academic institutions are able to access content from Wiley journals back to 1997 and to publish open access in all of the publisher‚Äôs hybrid and gold open access journal portfolio (ca. 1,500 journals). The costs of the agreement are based on the number of articles published, with the per-article PAR fee set at ‚Ç¨2,750 for publications in hybrid journals. A 20% discount applies to the article processing charges for publications in gold open access journals. =With Springer Nature= On August 22, 2019, Projekt DEAL signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Springer Nature which was followed by a 3-year contract starting 1st of January, 2020. This second agreement negotiated by Projekt DEAL is regarded as the world‚Äôs largest transformative open access agreement at the time of signing. With more than 13,000 scholarly articles by authors affiliated with German institutions accepted for publication each year in Springer Nature journals, the publisher disseminates a significant portion of Germany‚Äòs research output. The agreement enables open access publishing of articles in approximately 2,500 Springer Nature journals and offers participating institutions extensive access to the publisher‚Äôs journal portfolio. Criticism Criticism of Projekt DEAL points to the fact that it focuses on the largest publishers only and that it would therefore encourage authors to publish open access exclusively with the two largest publishers with which there are agreements in place. Under this assumption, Projekt DEAL would therefore put smaller and emerging fully open access publishers at a competitive disadvantage, and would have the potential to harm the long tail of fully (gold) open access publishers, undermining fair competition between publishers.

Life  Alfred Engleder was proven to have committed two murders and attempted four more. The initially unsuccessful search operation for Engleder years later served the cabaret artist Helmut Qualtinger as a model for the crime enterprise \\"Kornmandl\\". The false suspicion and detention of physician G√ºnther Hoflehner after the first murder was the subject of the 1958 feature film \\"Confess, Doctor Corda\\". In his actions, Engleder always followed the same pattern. Riding on a bicycle, he approached women and hit them in the head with a heavy hammer, to subsequently rape the injured victim. Between 1951 and 1957 he incapacitated and raped six women in the Steyr region, where on November 10, 1955, Margarete Fluch and on June 10, 1957 Herta Feichtiger died. While attacking his sixth victim on June 15, 1957, he was surprised by a motorcyclist and fled. He left his bike and clock on the scene, which finally convicted him. After a huge search, Engleder was arrested on June 19, 1957, by forester Johann Hansal on the Czech border at the Customs Guard.Meldung auf chroniknet.de As a motive Engleder stated \\"hatred of women\\". He felt betrayed by them. He divorced his first wife and only entered a second marriage because a child was expected. In 1958 he was sentenced to life imprisonment in Steyr for murder in two cases and attempted murder in four cases, but was released on probation after 26 years and found merciful reception in the Schottenstift monastery in Vienna. On April 8, 1993, he was attacked in Vienna by his new girlfriend, a prostitute, with a knife and injured.

Early life and education  Jackson completed her undergraduate studies at Western Washington University. Jackson then attended the University of Montana, which she graduated in 2011 with a Masters of Science. She attended the University of Oregon, where she earned a doctorate in geography and glaciology. She worked in The Glacier Lab under the supervision of Mark Carey. Together they proposed a feminist glaciology framework for global environmental change. They proposed the study to provoke discussion about the people who are researching glaciers, and whose voices are left out. She completed her thesis, \\"Tangled Up in Blue: Narratives of Glacier Change in Southeast Iceland\\", in 2017. Jackson is a three-time U.S. Fulbright Fellow, completing research fellowships in Turkey and Iceland. On her second Fulbright-funded project she worked in H√∂fn, looking at how climate change affected glacier communities. During her PhD she became a National Geographic Explorer. She has served in the Peace Corps in Zambia.  Career  Jackson has given several TED talks, but is best known for her 2017 TED talk \\"Glaciers, Gender and Science\\". Jackson has spoken often on the harassment she received as a female scientist.https://earthtalk.org/m-jackson/ Jackson is an Arctic expert and Emerging Explorer for the National Geographic Society. She has led expeditions across the Arctic. She regularly visits glaciers around the world.

The project partners with the National Geographic Explorers, filmmakers and scientists. In 2018 Jackson was announced as a TED Fellow for her work highlighting how people and glaciers interact.  While Glaciers Slept  Jackson's first book, While Glaciers Slept, was published by Green Writer's Press in June 2015. It explores the parallels between the destruction of the planet as a result of climate change and a family facing the loss of parents. The book combines personal science with exploration, and was well received by critics. The book's foreword is by Bill McKibben. She has given several talks about this book and her exploration work.

Early life Michelis was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine; her father was an Italian cobbler and her mother, a governess, was from Alsace, her parents having left the region in the 1870s in order to retain French nationality. Her brother, Jean, was four years her junior. She was educated first at the local girls' school, then at the Lyc√©e Condorcet in Paris and finally at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de jeunes filles at S√®vres. She was a member of the Jeunesse √âtudiante Chr√©tienne, a Christian youth organisation. Wartime activities Her first teaching post was at the Lyc√©e de jeunes filles at le Havre, but she was forced to leave in 1940 because of the bombing. She was transferred to the Lyc√©e Victor Duruy in Paris, and subsequently to the Lyc√©e d‚Äô√âtat de Jeunes Filles d'Amiens, later renamed the Lyc√©e Madeleine Michelis d'Amiens in her honour. In 1942, she gave shelter to a Jewish girl, Claude Dalsace, whose father had been deported; Michelis managed to get her to safety in the \\"zone libre\\". As a member of the Lib√©ration-Nord and the \\"Shelburn\\" network, Michelis was involved in the rescue of airmen and escaped prisoners who found their way to the countryside of Picardy. It was for her actions in the period between November 1943 and February 1944 that she was posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom by the United States. She was arrested at Amiens railway station on 12 February 1944 and taken to the Gestapo headquarters at the Lyc√©e Montaigne in Paris for questioning. The official version of her death given by her superiors in the Resistance was that she had committed suicide on 15 February rather than face further interrogation. Two other teachers arrested at around the same time, Th√©r√®se Pierre and Suzanne Blin, also died while under arrest. The tortures inflicted on her included waterboarding. On 15 February, she told other prisoners that she had been placed in an icy bath and could not warm up afterwards. Some stated that, the next day, she was again taken for interrogation; she was never seen alive again. Yet another version of her death was given by General Charles de Gaulle in her medal citation: that she was strangled by her captors. Jean-Louis Cr√©mieux-Brilhac, a member of the Free French Forces, stated that he was notified of this by telegram. Legacy The state of Israel posthumously conferred on her the title of Righteous Among the Nations, on 24 November 1997. Streets in Paris and her home town of Neuilly-sur-Seine have been named Rue Madeleine Michelis in her honour. Letters written by Michelis are now held by the Institut d'histoire du temps pr√©sent. A high school in Amiens, France (Lyc√©e Madeleine Michelis) is named after her.

After she was shot down on 1 August 1943 she was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd Class.  Early life  Kashirina was born in the year 1920 in the village of Sergievka before moving to the village of Semenetskoe where she lived until she moved with her mother to Perovo on the outskirts of Moscow. Having dreamed of becoming a pilot from a young age she joined the Moscow Aeroclub where she graduated flight courses before the German invasion of the Soviet Union.  Military career  After Germany invaded the Soviet Union Kashirina voluntarily joined the Soviet Air Force to serve in a women's aviation regiment founded by Marina Raskova. After graduating from Engels Military Aviation School she was deployed to the Southern Front in late May 1942 in the 588th Night Bomber Regiment as an aircraft mechanic, but she was eventually assigned to fly in squadron number one under the command of Serafima Amosova after passing navigation courses. In August 1942 the regiment received orders to immediately relocate to a new airfield due to a German approach. A plane that she and a fellow mechanic Sophia Ozerkova were repairing was not airworthy due to serious issues with the engine, but by the time a delivery of replacement parts arrived German troops were too close, leaving them no choice but to burn the grounded airplane and travel to the new airfield where the rest of their regiment was waiting for them by car. On the way the car broke down and both girls had to walk on foot to their destination for three weeks until they arrived at a Soviet stronghold in Mozdok. During the three-week hike Kashirina had contracted typhus and was taken to a field hospital by Ozerkova after they arrived. After recovering from typhus she completed her navigator's training to begin flying combat sorties. Yevdokiya Nosal offered to fly with her as pilot on her first night of bombing missions because as a more experienced pilot she would often fly with new crew members on their first night of bombing sorties. After several successful sorties that night the Po-2 piloted by Nosal was chased by a German fighter over Novorossiysk and attacked; a piece of shrapnel from a shell hit Nosal in the forehead, killing her instantly and causing her to slump over the controls when the plane went into a sharp dive. With partial loss of control due to damage inflicted on the plane by the attack, Kashirina managed to take control of the plane and land it by herself at the airfield where Nosal was immediately pronounced dead. For landing the plane with her pilot dead and damage to the controls Kashirina was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and Nosal was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, becoming the first member of the regiment awarded the title and the first woman pilot awarded the title during the war. When the 588th Night Bomber Regiment was awarded the Guards designation in 1943, Kashirina was one of the three service members to carry the Guards flag at the ceremony, with Natalya Meklin designated as the primary flag bearer with Yekaterina Titova and Kashirina as assistants. Before her death she participated in bombing missions as navigator over Mius, Seversky Donets, and Don rivers and on the outskirts of Stavropol. On the night between 31 July and 1 August 1943, Kashirina's plane piloted by Valentina Polunina was one of the four Po-2s of the regiment shot down by Luftwaffe pilot Josef Kociok over the Kuban Bridgehead on the Taman Peninsula. All eight members of the regiment that were killed that night were buried in the mass grave of Russkoe village and posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 2nd Class.

Background  Carabinieri units devoted to the riot control and to tactical tasks experienced several organizational phases, from late 1910s to the present day. While from 1919 until 1963 Carabinieri riot units were under the exclusive control of Carabinieri Legions (inter- provincial commands), since 1963 they have been under an unified command: from 1963 to 2000 the Command was set at the Brigade level, while the present-day Division was established in 2001. = 1919-1923 = The history of the branch of the Carabinieri specifically dedicated to quell massive civil disturbances dates back in 1919, when 18 Carabinieri Autonomous Mobile Battalions (Battaglioni Mobili Autonomi) were established in order to deal with the Biennio Rosso. Before 1919, the operational approach to riot control consisted in drawing Carabinieri from the territorial stations near the event, replacing them with Carabinieri drawn in turn from other Stations; since 1908 several proposes had been made by Carabinieri officers to form organic Carabinieri units in order to not to steal Carabinieri from the territorial police service and to improve the harmony within the ranks of Carabinieri assigned to public order services;pp. 271‚Äì273 the proposal was suspended due to the outbreak of the World War One.p. 14 At the end of the World War One, the Royal Italian Army was reduced and both the Royal Carabinieri and the Royal Guard of Public Security were augmented.p. 268 Following the end of the War, participants to rallies increased in numbers and Army units deployed in internal order services significantly decreased. The Arm of Carabinieri, in order to sustain the increasingly heavy duty, established for the first time outside war several Army-style Battalions.pp. 269‚Äì270 On 7 December 1918, the Carabinieri General Command elaborated a proposal for War Minister Alberico Albricci, assuming the establishment of 15p. 282 to 16p. 16 Mobile Battalions under the relevant Carabinieri Legion. The total strength of the Mobile Battalions was envisioned in 5,000 Carabinieri. According to the proposal, each Battalion should have had 5 trucks with attached drivers and mechanics, two motorcycles for commanders of the detachments and a light car for the commanding Colonel.pp. 280‚Äì282 Under the 1918 proposal, Legions with two Mobile Battalions assigned were to be led by a Brigadier General, with two Colonels, one of which assigned to the task of commanding the Battalioni Group.p. 16 On 13 March 1919, the War Ministry ordered the provisional establishment of 16 Carabinieir Mobile Battalions, whose organization was to be dealt with by the General Command.p. 16 On 30 March 1919, Commandant General Luigi Cauvin issued executive orders of the establishment of the Mobile Battalions of the Royal Carabinieri. According to Article 3 of the executive orders, the Carabinieri Mobile Battalion was organized into:p. 17 * 3 Infantry Companies, (4 Platoons each); * 1 Cyclists Companies (2 Platoons). Each Mobile Battalion was to be led by a Lieutenant Colonel (Mobile Battalions of Alessandria, Genoa, Verona, Trieste, Treviso, Bologna, Ancona, Cagliari, Bari, two of the three Battalions of Rome, one of the two Battalions of Turin, Milan, Naples, Florence and Palermo)p. 19 or by a Major (Mobile Battalions of Udine, Taranto, Catania, one Mobile Battalion in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Naples and Palermo),p. 19 assisted by an Aide ranking Lieutenant, each Company was to be led by a Captain, while Platoons could be led by a Lieutenant, a Second Lieutenant or by a senior Sub-Officer.p. 17 The strength of each Mobile Battalions was to be 782 officers and troops. According to Article 7, Carabinieri of the Mobile Battalions were to be deployed in organic units (Platoon, Company, or the whole Battalion) always under their own subofficers and officers. The training was specifically designed for public order and riot control services.pp. 284‚Äì286 One quarter of the strength of each battalion was to be assigned to the territorial support of the relevant Legion.p. 17 Battalions were to be housed in separate barracks, from other Royal Carabinieri and, in case of more than one Battalion assigned to the same city, on the opposite side of the urban centre; at least one officer had to be housed in the barracks.p. 18 On 25 August 1919, another study elaborated by the General Command proposed the establishment of Mobile Battalions as a quick reaction force, also in response to insurrections to be dealt with by the Army. The 1919 proposal envisioned therefore a mechanized unit consisting of Cyclist Companies, special trains (also available for natural disasters), and fast trucks; the training for personnel assigned to the Battalions was designed in order to improve the cohesion and decision.pp. 283‚Äì284 The Royal Decree of 2 October 1919, no. 1802 sanctioned the existing situation, authorizing the establishment of the Carabinieri Mobile Battalions.p. 21 By force of the Royal Decree of 20 April 1920, no. 451, eighteen Autonomous Mobile Battalions were established.pp. 279‚Äì280 The autonomous mobile Battalions took the name of their seat and were marked with serial number if more than one Battalion were assigned in the same city: Turin (2 Battalions), Alessandria, Genoa, Milan (2 Battalions), Verona, Florence, Bologna, Ancona, Rome (2 Battalions), Naples (2 Battalions), Bari, Palermo, Catania. The 1920 Battalions were organized on: * 3 Carabinieri on foot companies; * 1 Cyclist Carabinieri Company; * 1 Machine-guns Section (2 Sections for seven Mobile Battalions: Torino 1¬∞, Milano 1¬∞, Firenze, Roma 1¬∞, Roma 2¬∞, Roma 3¬∞, Palermo).p. 24 Each Battalion had a total force of 750 men under the command of a lieutenant colonel.pp. 279‚Äì280 Mobile Battalions in Alessandria, Treviso, Cagliari, Catanzaro and Messina were established outside the 1918 plan, due to evolving needs.pp. 280‚Äì282 Two years later, in 1922, six Battalions were disestablished and at the next year the remaining Battalions followed. However, three Battalions subordinated to the local Legion remained in existence: two in Rome and one in Palermo. = Operations = The first period of existence of Mobile Battalions was short but intense. In 1919 the most serious disturbances occurred in Novara, Milan, Brescia, Rome, Piombino, Viareggio, Corenza and Venice, Apulia and Piedmont. The 1st Bersaglieri Regiment mutinied in Ancona in June 1920, but it was brought down by a Carabinieri Battalion. In 1921 serious disturbances erupted in several municipalities of Campania, including Castellamare di Stabia, in the major towns and cities of Tuscany, in Apulia, including Bari, and in Rome. In the same years, the Blackshirts movement clashed with leftist formations and strikes increased. Between 1919 and 1920, the Carabinieri performed 233 public order and riot control operations and suffered 517 casualties (43 dead and 474 wounded). Facing increasingly combative demonstrations, the government authorities left loose rules of engagement to the police forces, with the result of bloody clashes. According to Arnaldo Grilli and Antonio Picci, between 1919 and 1922, Carabinieri Mobile Battalions were awarded with 2 Gold Medals of Military Valour, 55 Silver Medals of Military Valour, 62 Bronze Medals of Military Valour, as well as hundreds of Solemn commendations. = 1940-1963 = In 1940 the new Army organization foresaw four Carabinieri Battalions, while on 3 January 1944 12 Battalions (renamed Mobile Battalions) were re-established,p. 232 in order to deal with the civil unrest following the end of the civil war, alongside with four Mobile Battalions Groups. The 1944-established Mobile Battalions were equipped, supplied and maintained by the relevant Carabinieri Legion. The Mobile Battalions Groups were: * 1st Group (HQ Milan), subordinated to the 1st Carabinieri Division \\"Pastrengo\\" and including Battalions based in Turin, Milan, Genoa and Padua; * 2nd Group (HQ Florence), subordinated to the 2nd Carabinieri Division \\"Podgora\\", including Bologna and Florence Battalions; * 3rd Group (HQ Rome), subordinated to the 2nd Carabinieri Division \\"Podgora\\", including Battalions \\"Lazio\\", \\"Rome\\" and \\"Cagliari\\"; * 4th Group (HQ Naples), subordinated to the 3rd Carabinieri Division \\"Ogaden\\", with Naples, Bari and Palermo Battalions. The Mobile Battalions were provided of new vehicles in order to enable them to deploy rapidly. In the immediate aftermaths of World War Two, both police and Carabinieri were strictly prohibited by armistice clauses to have hand grenades, machine guns, rifles and even handguns.pp. 63‚Äì64 Ferruccio Parri, Prime Minister in 1945, supported the reinforcement of the Carabinieri in order to enable them to counter threats to public order.p. 64,85 In 1945 Carabinieri sustained 29 casualties during public order services.p. 67 In 1949 Minister of Interior Mario Scelba asked the General Command of the Carabinieri and Minister of Defence Randolfo Pacciardi to provide Carabinieri of batons and other riot-specific equipment. Both the General Command and the Defence Minister refused.pp. 144‚Äì146 According to Virgilio Ilari, as of 1949 the Carabinieri mobile forces consisted of 13 Battalions and 34 Trucked Units (Nuclei Autocarrati), with an updated equipment. On 6 August 1956, the blue beret was assigned to mobile units (Mobile Battalions and Trucked Units). On 26 August 1949, the Banditry Repression Forces Command was established under Colonel Ugo Luca.p. 170 Between 1951 and 1963, a new Parachute Carabinieri Battalion was established.p. 183 After the end of the Second World War, in Italy occurred several security crisis: banditry in Sicily and in Sardinia, and civil disturbances across the country.pp. 168‚Äì169 Such disturbances were politically motivated and, as such, differently reported.pp. 61‚Äì63 In the aftermaths of World War Two (between 1946 and 1948), Carabinieri managed to evade the majority of the riot control operations;p. 89,135 nonetheless, during riot control operations carried out from the end of the war to 1948, 101 Carabinieri died, while 757 others were wounded. According to Antonio Sannino, the fact that the Carabinieri remained hostile to Communists' approaches caused the British support to them.p. 86 Between 1945 and 1948, Carabinieri underwent a massive rearmament in order to deal with institutional duties. In 1945 they had only 5 armoured vehicles and 79 trucks; in 1948 Carabinieri deployed 264 armoured vehicles and 1358 trucks.p. 407 In 1945, each Battalion deployed 12 M15/42 tanks; in 1946 tanks were retired and replaced with Staghound armoured cars. In 1953 each Battalion received two Tank Platoons (8 tanks) with M3 Stuart light tanks, and as of 1958 each Battalion could deploy 8 M4 Sherman tanks and 13 Staghound armoured cars. As of 1962, each Battalion had 6 tanks and 5 light armoured cars.p. 117-118  1963-2000: 11th Brigade  Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo established the XI Mechanized Brigade when he was Carabinieri Commandant-General. The 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade existed for a continued period of 37 years, and in 2001, with the transformation of the Carabinieri in an autonomous Armed Force, it evolved into the Carabinieri Mobile Units Division. During these years, the Brigade passed through the Cold War and the Years of Lead.  Early proposals  Following the 1960 Genoa clashes, a reform project for the Mobile Battalions was envisioned, but later abandoned. Both the organization and the equipment (which included old Sherman tanks and trucked units) were found to be obsolete either inadequate to emergency tasks.p. 48 On 27 January 1963, the Commandant General of the Carabinieri at the time, Lieutenant General Giovanni De Lorenzo, endorsed a proposal of then-Colonel Franco Picchiottip. 107 in order to reorganize riot units. In this proposal, Mobile Battalions were to be available for both wartime and peacetime tasks, with a wartime organization and a reduced peacetime one.pp. 497‚Äì498 = Picchiotti-De Lorenzo proposal = The Picchiotti-De Lorenzo proposal called for Mobile Battalions to be available for both wartime and peacetime tasks. Such Mobile Battalions were to be equipped with all necessary capabilities in order to act when isolated and to overcome significant resistance without having to rely on other Italian Army or other Italian Armed Forces elements.p. 62 Mobile Battalions as envisaged by the proposal had to maintain a significant concentration and movement rapidity and readiness and the organic equipment (both in terms of personnel and materials) to be ready to fulfil the wartime tasks.p. 63 Mobile Battalions also were to be with a wartime organization and a reduced peacetime one;pp. 497‚Äì498 Mobile Battalions were therefore to be separated to the territorial Carabinieri Legions (regiment-level commands) and organizationally framed within three Carabinieri Regiments. Those Regiments were to have a distinctive operational structure with training, disciplinary and deployment functions, while administrative duties were to be discharged by the relevant territorial Legion.p. 63 In the proposal, only the VII and XIII Mobile Battalions were excluded by the grouping within the three Regiments; after the general elections (which De Lorenzo deemed to be imminent), the VII Carabinieri Mobile Battalion was to be disestablished and re-established in order to be subordinated to the IV Army Corps.p. 64 Cavalry units were deemed to be too fragmented and therefore the proposal also suggested that mounted Carabinieri were to be concentrated in robust cavalry units,p. 498 by reducing Carabinieri stations manned by mounted Carabinieri to a maximum of 70, employing the new cavalry units en masse (both alone or alongside mechanized units). All cavalry forces were to be grouped within a dedicated Regiment with three Squadrons Groups (Battalion-sized cavalry units).p. 63-64  Establishment  On 29 March 1963 Minister of Defence Giulio Andreotti approved the proposal, and the following day the Army General Staff transmitted the authorization to the Carabinieri General Command.p. 64 On 1 April 1963, with the 1960s Army and Carabinieri reorganization, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was established directly under the General Command led by Giovanni De Lorenzo, in order to cope with the internal territorial defence needs. The first commander of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was Brigadier General Franco Picchiotti.p. 514 The establishment of the new brigade was in order to adjust the organization of the Battalions and of cavalry units both for strictly military tasks, and those related to the protection of public order and riot control. The aim was to ensure Carabinieri Battalions the availability of all elements necessary to be in a position to act in isolation and overcome considerable resistance without having to rely on the competition of other Army Corps or other Armed Forces, to ensure Battalions' speed of movement and concentration in large sectors of foreseeable use and a constant high training level. On the other hand, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade had only support tasks, the Interior Ministry retained the power of deployment of Carabinieri Battalions through the General Command and the Brigade Command.p. 521 The establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was controversial: some senior officers criticized the decision, deeming that the essential features of the Carabinieri were capillarity and focus on criminal police activity.p. 48 Ferruccio Parri deemed that the establishment of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade was purported to form an \\"Army within an Army\\", ready to intervene in the political balance.p. 492 Overall, in 1963, the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of about 5,000 men with 80 tracked vehicles, 200 other military vehicles (including M113 armored personnel carriers)p. 276, 130 M47 Patton tanks and a paratroopers battalion. However, the brigade never had responsibility for actual unitary operational command, lacking supports due to a political choice, but exercised the tasks of instruction and preparation for the riot control activities. In the 1963 reorganization, Mobile Battalions were renamed simply Battalions and were marked with a sequential number, while remaining administratively dependent on the relevant Legion; the Battalions Groups were renamed Carabinieri Regiments, and were given the conceptual role of a resolution unit in both riot and tactical tasks; In accordance with the Picchiotti-De Lorenzo proposal, Regiments had only disciplinary, training and deployment functions, while general management rested within the relevant Legion. The newly formed Mechanized Brigade exercised its operational and training authority on: * 1st Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Milan): commanding I, II, III and IV Battalions; * 2nd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome): commanding V, VI, VIII and IX Battalions; * 3rd Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Naples): commanding X, XI and XII Battalions; * 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Rome) with 2 Squadrons Groups (Battalion-level units) and 1 Armoured-motorized Squadron; * VII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under IV Army Corps; despite being the newest Battalion, the unit inherited traditions and number of the second battalion of Rome, which was disestablished. * XIII Battalion (directly under the Brigade Command), under V Army Corps. The command structure of the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade consisted of: * Staff, with personnel management and training bodies; * Services Office, with activation and research tasks; * Army officers of Transmissions and Motorization organizations, with management, technical, inspecting and consulting tasks. = Evolution = The 1963 reorganization did not mark the end of the organizational shifts. In 1964, 1st Carabinieri Helicopter Section was established. Between 1973 and 1976, the 5th Carabinieri Regiment (HQ Mestre) also existed, including IV, VII and XIII Battalions. On 1 September 1977, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and their Battalions were transferred under the direct operational and training authority of the 11th Mechanized Brigade; the 4th Mounted Carabinieri Regiment was renamed Mounted Carabinieri Regiment. In 1975 the XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade changed its name in 11th Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade (with Arabic numerals) and in 1976 the formation was renamed 11th Carabinieri Brigade; at the same time, the Brigade Command was tasked to exercise only training and logistical authority. In 1977, the three Carabinieri Regiments were disestablished and 4th Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment changed its name in Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment, with the Battalions being directly under the Brigade Command. The following year an Inspecting Colonel was appointed, while in 1979 two additional Colonels followed. With the end of the Cold War, the mobile organization lost its combat-oriented connotation, taking over the role of force mainly devoted to the performance of riot control. The 1st Carabinieri Group in Milan and the 2nd Carabinieri in Rome were established in the 1990s within the 11th Brigade; these units were renamed, in 1995, respectively Carabinieri Regiment in Milan and Carabinieri Regiment in Rome. In 1996, the 1st Carabinieri Battalion was transformed in the 1st Parachute Carabinieri Regiment \\"Tuscania\\", although it remained within Paratroopers Brigade Folgore until 2002. = Brigade subordination = From its establishment to October 1964, the XI Mechanized Brigade was directly subordinated to the General Command of the Carabinieri and under the IV Army Corps. In October 1964 the XI Mechanized Brigade was subordinated to an Inspector, ranking Divisional general.p. 232 The XI Mechanized Brigade was subordinated, on 7 March 1965, to the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Special Units, which included not only the XI Mechanized Brigade, but also all other tactical Carabinieri units: the Carabinieri Paratroopers Battalion, the Territorial Squadrons Groups of Milan, Cagliari and Palermo, the Trucked Units, as well as the naval service. Two years later, on 10 March 1967, the post was modified in \\"Inspectorate of Mechanized Units\\", being disbanded in May 1967. In 1968 the blue beret was modified, making it identical in shape to the maroon beret used by paratroopers. Between 1967 and 1968 it was set up the Inspectorate of Mechanized and Training Units (led by a Divisional general), with responsibility on the X Carabinieri Brigade (including schools) and XI Carabinieri Mechanized Brigade. In 1971 it was established the Inspectorate Schools and Special Carabinieri Units; it controlled the X Brigade (dedicated to training) and XI Brigade. On 22 September 1980, the Inspectorate changed its name to Carabinieri Division School and Special Carabinieri Units \\"Palidoro\\". In 1985, the Command was deprived of training component and was reorganized on the XI Brigade (Carabinieri Battalions) and the XII Brigade (specialist units); the brigade was therefore placed under a command called Carabinieri Mobile and Special Units Division \\"Palidoro\\".  Carabinieri Battalion  The Carabinieri Battalion has been, since their initial establishment in 1919, the Carabinieri basic operational element for riot control operations. Carabinieri Battalions underwent several reorganizations. The bulk of Carabinieri Battalions consisted (and had consisted until the suspension of the conscription in Italy) of Auxiliary Carabinieri, i.e. young conscripted soldiers. Rifle Companies all consisted of Auxiliary Carabinieri.p. 111 According to General Picchiotti, if necessary, each Battalion could become a full Regiment with a call to arms of retired Auxiliary Carabinieri.p. 114 With the 1963 reorganization each Carabinieri Battalion was led by a Lieutenant colonel or a major and consisted of:. * 1 Command Company (1 Command Platoon, 1 Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon); * 2 Rifle Companies (1 Command Platoon, 3 Rifle platoons, 1 Company weapons Platoon each); * 1 Mortars Company; * 1 Tanks Company (1 Command Platoon, 3 Tanks Platoons) It was therefore a robust tactical complex, designed to carry out both riot control and counter-insurgency operations.p. 107 Notwithstanding the equipment upgrade requested by Lieutenant General De Lorenzo, vehicles remained an issue. While in theory all Rifle Companies should have been Mechanized Companies, only one Rifle Company in each Battalion was equipped with M-113 APCs, and the other one was equipped with Fiat Campagnola off-road vehicles.p. 116 Similarly, the full Tank Company (16 main battle tanks) was in force only at VII and XIII Battalions; the remaining unit had only a Tank Platoon.pp. 116‚Äì117 The Carabinieri Battalions had to be used only when the police and the territorial organization of the Carabinieri had been found insufficient, in order not to deprive the General Command of a valuable combat tool; in ordinary circumstances, the Battalion units were to be deployed on foot, lightly armed, with the armoured personnel carriers used only for troops transportation.p. 108 In 1969, under the command of former partisan Brigadier General Pietro Loretelli,p. 532 Battalions framed within Carabinieri Regiments were reorganized. The new structure consisted of: * Battalion Command Unit; * Command and Services Company (1 Command and Services Platoon, 1 Scouts Platoon, 1 Transmissions Platoon, 1 Tanks Platoon, 1 Transportations Platoon); * 2 Mechanized Rifle Companies (1 Command and Services Platoon, 3 Rifle Platoons, 1 Mortars Platoon each). According General Adamo Markert, as of 1969, the most prepared Carabinieri Battalions were headquartered in Gorizia, Bolzano, and Padua, ready for engagement in war.p. 519 Between 1977 and 1978 all Carabinieri Battalions, with the exception of the 7th and 13th Carabinieri Battalions, were given the War Flag. Overall, Carabinieri Battalions were divided into two groups, according to the main type (motorized or mechanized unit) of units deployed by the Battalion itself. Both VII and XIII Battalions were to be always maintained at their full wartime force. Within the VII Battalion, based in Laives, the Counter-terrorism Special Company was established in 1960s to counter South Tyrolean terrorism;p. 187 the security operations were also supported by several Trucked Units (which remained outside the Brigade).  Operational history  During the Years of Lead and the subsequent period most of the Battalions reduced their military training in order to deal with riot control activities. 7th and 13th Battalions maintained instead their military capabilities and were transferred under direct Army operational control. Each infantry company of each Battalion established, in this period, an \\"Intervention Platoon\\", in order to upgrade the responsiveness to serious riots.p. 191 The XI Brigade participated to the repression of South Tyrolean terrorism in 1960s;p. 187 according to General Giancarlo Giudici, in 1964 the Carabinieri deployed a Command Company, two Mechanized Companies, a Tanks Company, a Mortars Company and 850 troops with very poor training. The 11th Carabinieri Brigade also intervened, through its subordinate units, in several natural disasters through the years. In the 1966 flood of the Arno, the XI Brigade provided 50 M-113 armoured vehicles and several tankers.p. 540 In the 1968 Belice earthquake, the XII Carabinieri Battalion \\"Sicilia\\", headquartered in Palermo, deployed its rescue unit and other troops, together with the IV Mounted Carabinieri Squadrons Group, under the leadership of the Carabinieri Legion of Palermo and under the guidance of the VI Carabinieri Brigade.pp. 549‚Äì551 In the 1971 Lazio earthquake, the Rescue Unit of the VIII Carabinieri Battalion was deployed.p. 555 In the 1976 Friuli earthquake, the 13th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Friuli Venezia Giulia\\", 4th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Veneto\\" (75 troops, three Rescue Platoons, in the immediate aftermaths)p. 559 and 7th Carabinieri Battalion \\"Trentino Alto Adige\\" (31 troops, in the immediate aftermaths)p. 559 intervened paying rescue and providing police and utility services.pp. 203‚Äì204 In the immediate aftermaths, 93 vehicles of the Carabinieri Battalions were deployed.p. 562 In the 1980 Irpinia earthquake, Carabinieri Battalions from Bari, Naples and Rome also intervened.pp. 203‚Äì204 In particular, in the early hours of the emergency the 11th Carabinieri Brigade deployed 1,500 troops and 180 vehicles, alongside several other Carabinieri assets.p. 53 Each of the rescue units provided from Carabinieri Battalions consisted of 120 troops with a field hospital, rescue vehicles and tools and field kitchens, as well as two physicians and paramedics. The 11th Carabinieri Brigade was routinely employed against organized crime, especially in Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia. In 1988 additional reinforcements were deployed in Aspromonte, while in mid 1995 the Brigade provided reinforcements to the territorial police organization against the Sardinian banditry.

The series, directed by Bruce MacDonald, follows Joshua Penny (Ben Chaplin), a post-graduate student whose mother, Harriet, is herself murdered after having been the sole eyewitness to another murder. The series is set in and around Brighton. Resort to Murder was first commissioned as an eight-part series in 1991 under the working title of Brighton Boy, and took over two years for writer Tony McHale to complete. In 1993, then-head of drama at the BBC, Charles Denton, green-lighted the series and awarded it a ¬£4.5 million budget. The series was filmed over the course of 17 weeks from September to December 1993. Several members of the cast were hand-picked by McHale. After shooting completed, producer Barry Hanson arranged a viewing of all eight episodes for executive producer Michael Wearing, and both concluded following the viewing that \\"the series just didn't work.\\" Then controller of BBC1, Alan Yentob, was later invited to a viewing of a director's cut of the first three episodes, heavily reworked by Wearing and Hanson. Yentob reportedly told them \\"he did not want such rubbish on his channel\\". Director Bruce MacDonald was then sacked from the project by Yentob, and the series was re-worked into five episodes, with writer McHale heavily involved in the editing process. More than eighteen months after completion, the series was finally listed for transmission on 27 July 1995, with episodes airing at 10pm on Thursdays. The series has never been released on VHS or DVD, although a soundtrack to the series was released via Debonair Records on 7 August 1995.

He is known as a painter, performer, independent art curator and theoretician, Who is obsessed with evolution and quantum physics. There are many opposite features gathered in the same place to give character to Jastrzƒôbski's art: Natural and artificial, alive and dead, orderly and random. His art is self-referential and establishes a fundamental reflection on the construction of a work of art. Form, color, scale, and space are the main media for him to conduct a study of the central issues of the build, tangibility and morphology of an ‚Äúartistic body‚Äù. The morphology of the works in Jastrzƒôbski's concept is not only about a result of theoretical reflection on the subject of art, but also a ‚Äúpoint of arrival‚Äù of a movement involving a deep exploration of form. During his artistic work, Jastrzƒôbski has been active under two different pseudonyms. Between 2003 and 2008, he used the pseudonym Adam-X to create a series of projects in public space, mainly murals and street tags. Since 2008 under another pseudonym Ixi Color he has made a number of temporary interventions project in public space, often engaged with performances. Vinyl has been Jastrzƒôbski's most important project so far. He applied Vinyl foil on plexiglass in an appearance of bacteria culture growing under a microscope.

He testified in court that he had been sentenced to six years' imprisonment for robbing and raping a woman. Then, after his release in 1998, he set out to seek revenge by starting a murder series. The killings lasted from the late 1990s until 2001, when the police arrested him on public grounds. Simelane made women go with him in the forest. He then tied his victims there and sexually assaulted them, stabbing or strangling them with his bare hands if they resisted too much. He also beheaded many of them, before or after death. Simelane often stole his victims' money and valuables to participate in gambling. Among his victims were several pregnant women. = Investigation = Shepherds in search of a runaway cow discovered body parts in the Usuthu-Pulp Forest in Malkerns and notified the authorities, who soon asked six South African forensics experts for administrative assistance.

The fresco occupies the nave of the Il Gesu, with both fresco painting and stucco molding.  Jesuit History  The Jesuit Order, or Society of Jesus, was formed in 1540, by Ignatius of Loyola.Reichold, Graf, and Wynne, Buildings that Changed the World, 102. He was wounded during his time as a Spanish viceroy; which led to his religious enlightenment. While their teachings would spread over many countries, the heart of the society was the Il Gesu, built in the late 1600s. Gian Paolo Oliva was the Father general of the Society of Jesus.Enggass, The Painting of Baciccio, 31. Bernini's Involvement Giovanni Battista Gaulli owes a great deal of his success on the ceiling fresco to Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Several other artists were considered for the job of painting the ceiling. Gian Paolo Oliva relied on Bernini's opinion when selecting the artist for the ceiling. Bernini is responsible for not only obtaining the commission for Gaulli, but also for inspiring some of the designs.Harris, Seventeenth-Century Art and Architecture, 132. If not for Bernini's illusionistic merging of architecture and sculpture, in the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa at the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria Della Vittoria, Gaulli's ceiling fresco may have turned out quite differently.Held and Posner, 17th and 18th Century Art: Baroque Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, 121. The illusionistic heavens upon the ceiling of the Gesu emphasizes how the church is seen as an intermediary between the mortal world and eternal salvation.Schneider-Adams, Key Monuments of the Baroque, 51. Gaulli also enacts a certain level of theatrics to the scene, yet again, similar to that found in the Cornaro Chapel. Triumph of the Name of Jesus The subject of Gaulli's ceiling fresco is the Adoration of the Name of Jesus, the story is taken from Saint Paul's Epistle to the Philippians.Harris, Seventeenth-Century Art and Architecture, 132-133. His words are written on a ribbon, just outside the architectural frame. These words set the scene for Gaulli's fresco and focus on the spreading of faith. The Jesuits wanted to enhance the religious experience, with an almost meditative, emotional peace.Bailey, Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit Art in Rome, 270 The high vaulted ceiling was not constructed merely for its grand and impressive appearance, but to enhance the experience during mass. The Jesuits relied heavily on the acoustics of the church; they wanted their faithful to clearly hear the words of the sermon. This is why the church was constructed with a single nave, and a dome at the nave, transept intersection. One of Gaulli's best innovations is the dramatic breaking of the three-dimensional frame. This gives the impression that the heavenly figures above have a true presence in the church, as if they are floating directly over the viewers' heads.Enggass, The Painting of Baciccio, 49. The depth achieved in the fresco extends past the physical ceiling, drawing the blessed upward into the infinite sky. Gaulli adds a pronounced, stucco, frame around his fresco; emphasizing the illusionistic division of the vault's interior and exterior space. When the viewer gazes upon the fresco it is almost impossible to differentiate between fresco and stucco molding. This adds to the illusion of the scene, making it more believable that there are souls ascending and descending in front of the viewer. Worship of the Holy Name of Jesus Church of the Ges√π There are minute details within the fresco. Gaulli took into consideration the perspective viewers would have, looking up at the ceiling, and painted the saved in an extremely foreshortened fashion to give the false illusion that they were truly floating above the viewers.Waterhouse, Italian Baroque Painting, 70. This draws the viewer in, allowing the viewer's eyes to move upward through the ascending angels. It also tricks the viewer into thinking the fresco has some dimension to it; evoking a sense of spiritual nature.Martin, Baroque, 174 At the apex of the heavenly light there is an almost hidden inscription of IHS, the first three letters of Jesus's name in Greek. This is the only representation of Christ in the ceiling painting. Christ is considered the light of the world; Gaulli took this literally when choosing to depict Christ by his initials and the heavenly light. Another detail within the fresco is Gaulli's attention to shadowing. The damned fall out of the frame, with the illusion that they are falling into the church. While the heavenly golden light falls upon the saved, ‚Äúthe illusionistic clouds‚Äù block this light from the damned; ‚Äúindicat[ing] that the {damned are} destined for eternal damnation.‚Äù There is an evident difference between the depicted angels and the damned. Gaulli's angels are flawless creatures; each kissed by the golden light of heaven. The pigment in their clothes, would resonate with the earthly clothes of the viewers.Enggass, The Painting of Baciccio, 50. Their faces adoringly look upward towards the light of heaven. Meanwhile, the damned fall from heaven, faces pained, screaming, some too ashamed they look away. Their bodies casted under a dark shadow, while their bodies slowly morph. Some age drastically, while other are transformed into monsters. The damned, outside of the frame, are presented nude. Presenting the idea that nudity is to be considered shameful. Nave of the Church of the Ges√π Gaulli's fresco can be broken up into three different parts. There is the heavenly light and Christ's initials at the center, the arc of clouds the separate the saved from the damned, and the damned figures falling out of the scene.Enggass, The Painting of Baciccio, 44. The blessed that rest upon the clouds hang just elbow the frame, giving the illusion that have not yet ascended outside the church into the heavens above. They all still resemble the human form; these qualities give hope to the viewers that salvation is not impossible. The damned greatly contrast that with their corrupted human form. Some of the damned are depicted with wings, claws, and horns. Others are in the process of transforming into hound light creatures. They have tormented faces, some shielding their faces from the harsh heavenly light.Enggass, The Painting of Baciccio, 45. Gaulli has adapted the Triumph of the Name of Jesus to extend both downward to the viewers and upward into the illusionistic heavens. Relying on his friend Bernini to influence and inspire one of his greatest works. Illusionistic ceiling paintings began to move in new directions after the completion of this piece. Gaulli's fresco has a complexity to it, making it a work worthy of a High Baroque status.McComb, The Baroque Painters of Italy: An Introductory Historical Survey, 69.

Abequa became the subject of an international manhunt when the murder was discovered. He avoided the efforts of government prosecutor Michael Murphy to extradite and try him due to the lack of an extradition treaty between Jordan and the United States. Murder Nihal Gussal Abequa was murdered by her husband after the couple had separated and she had filed for divorce. Her body was discovered when her sister, who had not heard from her, went to the apartment and, not finding her, called the police. Abequa fled soon after the murder, taking the couple's six year-old daughter Lisa and three year-old son Sami with him. The murderer and the couple's children became the subjects of an international manhunt. =Victim= Nihal Gussal, known as Nina to her fiends, immigrated with her family to the United States from Turkey as a young child. She was a naturalized citizen and served for four years in the United States Army. She worked as an insurance claims adjuster and had an additional, early morning job delivering newspapers to make ends meet. The couple were married in 1986 and had two children. Gussal filed for divorce stating that Abequa had hit and choked her, had broken the telephone to prevent her form calling the police, had repeatedly beaten the children with a belt and that he had threatened to kidnap the children and take them to live in Jordan. =Perpetrator= Perpetrator, who had served as a mechanic in the Royal Jordanian Army, was a naturalized United States citizen. =Efforts at extradition= According to the New York Times, \\"the victim's family and high-ranking American officials, including President Clinton, had used every available diplomatic channel to persuade Jordan to extradite him to the United States\\" to stand trial. Jordan and the United States did not have an extradition treaty in the 1990s. Jordanian trial, conviction, and release Jordanian prosecutor, Khalid Darwish, traveled to New Jersey to gather evidence. Abequa was tried, convicted and sentenced in July 1995 to 15 years in prison for murder. However, he was given a \\"palace pardon\\" and released from prison in November 2000. Custody of children Senator Frank Lautenberg blocked foreign aid to Jordan until the Jordanian government agreed to permit the Abequa children to return to the United States to live with their mother's sister, Nesime Dokur, in New Jersey. Resident of Finland The Morris County Prosecutor's Office attempted again to extradite Abequa in 2017, when it was discovered that he had moved to Finland. The original indictment for killing his wife on either 3 or 4 July 1994, then kidnapping their two children and absconding to Jordan, was still active and actionable in 2017.

Stein is an American journalist best known for winning the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for writing on ‚Äúpolitics and other issues affecting New York City residents.‚Äù He spent his career as the co- publisher and editor of The Riverdale Press, a weekly newspaper serving the Northwest Bronx. Stein and his brother Richard Stein were awarded the Eugene S. Pulliam First Amendment Award by the Society of Professional Journalists for courage in continuing to publish following the 1989 firebombing of The Riverdale Press office in retaliation for an editorial defending the novelist Salman Rushdie. He won the Lisa and Richard Witten Award for Excellence in Teaching during his last year at Hunter College in 2014.  Personal life  Bernard L. Stein was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Riverdale, the Bronx, where his father founded The Riverdale Press in 1950. He was the editor of his elementary school newspaper, the PS 81 Livewire, and his high school paper, the Science Survey, at the Bronx High School of Science. Stein earned his bachelor's degree from Columbia University, then moved to Berkeley, California, enrolling as a graduate student in English Literature at the University of California but did not finish that degree. Stein was one of nearly 800 demonstrators arrested during a sit-in at a UC Berkeley administration building while being enrolled in 1964, which became a moment in the Free Speech Movement. He went on to become one of the founders of the Berkeley chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, and to help found an SDS freedom school in the West Oakland ghetto. After leaving graduate school, Stein worked at the Mark Twain Papers, the largest archive of Mark Twain's manuscripts in the world, housed at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library. Instead of staying six months as he planned, he stayed for 12 years, becoming a scholarly editor. He was responsible for establishing definitive editions of Twain's published and unpublished writing, including letters, notebooks, and the novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Stein was also a member of the editorial board of three radical publications: The Movement, a newspaper affiliated with Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Students for a Democratic Society, and Leviathan and Steps, both short-lived, independent magazines. Stein moved back to New York in 1978 and succeeded his father as editor of The Riverdale Press. He became co-publisher on his father's retirement in 1979, leading the newspaper for 30 years. In 1989, the Riverdale Press office was firebombed in response to an editorial that criticized the Iranian head of state for placing a bounty on the head of novelist Salman Rushdie and also criticized American bookstore chains for pulling his novel \\"The Satanic Verses\\" from their shelves. In 1986, The Riverdale Press exposed corruption on the community school board that oversaw Riverdale's schools. It investigated the construction of the largest medical waste incinerator in New York State, in the Port Morris section of South Bronx, in 1991. The work turned into a crusade that led to the indictment of the chair of the local community board, a congressional hearing, and, eventually, to the dismantling of the incinerator, which contrary to its developer's claims, was poisoning the air. As a result, the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, The Deadline Club, honored The Riverdale Press with its most prestigious award for community service. The Riverdale Press won over 400 state and national awards for excellence and was named the best weekly newspaper in New York State eight times during Stein's editorship. Stein was the second James H. Ottaway Sr. Professor of Journalism at the State University of New York at New Paltz in 2002. In 2005, Stein joined the faculty of Hunter College of the City University of New York as a professor of journalism. He began teaching at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism in 2006 as well. During his time at Hunter College, Stein founded The Hunts Point Express, a newspaper and online news outlet staffed by students and serving the poorest neighborhoods in the South Bronx. At the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism, Stein founded a sister paper, the Mott Haven Herald. Bernard and Richard Stein sold The Riverdale Press in 2008. Stein retired in 2014.
