At the waterfall base, a viewing area is available. The falls were one of the largest industrial centers in the 1800s and are responsible for the growth of the village around them.  History  The Chagrin Falls originally got their name from a French trader named Francois Seguin, who traded with Native Americans in the early 1700s. The river later adopted the name \\"Chagrin\\". At one point the Chagrin Falls was the industrial center of Northeast Ohio and powered 9 different mills at their peak. The first settlers arrived in 1833 and they had previously been from New England. With the profits they made from their mill work on the falls, they began to build their homes around the river and created the now current day Chagrin Falls village.  Geography  The Chagrin river flows through the center of Chagrin Falls Village. The falls have a drop of 20 feet and a crest line of 60 feet. The water at the bottom of the falls ranges from 2‚Äì15 feet.  Wildlife  The waterfalls and their surrounding are provided habitats for multiple types of Northeastern Ohio's native animals. Some of these animals include salamanders, squirrels, groundhogs, coyote, and other small animals. There is also a large fish population due to the location of the river.

Biography  Chigirinsky was born on July 17, 1983 in the city of Pervouralsk in the family of a plant security guard and a butcher. While still in school, he began to steal, and was detained while attempting to steal from the city's food store, for which he was registered in the Inspectorate for Juvenile Affairs of the Internal Affairs Directorate. By that time Chigirinsky had already been registered with a psychiatrist, and according to some reports, he had a birth trauma associated with the nervous system. He graduated from the 9th grade of school, with a specialty of a mechanic in the area of repairing metallurgical equipment. For 1.5 years he worked in the Pervouralsk New Pipe Plant, but was forced to move to another place because of staff reduction. He also had to move back in with his parents because of his low salary. The first murder Chigirinsky committed was on July 3, 2005. That day, leading a girl named Anya into the forest, he first strangled then raped her. He then burned her clothes, and buried the corpse, despite the fact that the murder occurred a few meters away from a pedestrian walkway through which the holiday residents constantly went through. The very next day an application for the girl's disappearance was filed by relatives to the law enforcement agencies. The murder remained unsolved. In 2006, Chigirinsky returned to the crime scene, dug up the corpse and tore off the head. The body was found only after the killer was arrested. On September 19, 2008, Chigirinsky committed another murder. The corpse was found 15 meters from the railroad tracks of Yekaterinburg-Shalya road and 50 meters from Stepan Razin Street. The victim had been raped and strangled, with her belly ripped open with a knife and her clothes burned. On May 28, 2009, Chigirinsky committed the last murder. The same day the corpse was found in the basement by the deceased's parents, who saw Chigirinsky leaving the cellar. He was quickly arrested, and the last victim's mobile phone was found in his possession. The court sentenced Chigirinsky to life imprisonment, and the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without change. He is currently serving his sentence in the Black Eagle prison.

The ATUC provides services to affiliated branches on a wide range of industrial, social and community issues and is affiliated to the STUC. It has an office based in Aberdeen, Scotland. History Trade unionists in Aberdeen first formed a committee in 1846, in order to support joiners who were on strike. This committee lasted for three years, and no further organisation was established until 1868, when stonemasons in the town held a ten-week strike. John Jessiman of the Associated Carpenters and Joiners of Scotland founded the Aberdeen United Trades Council, with the aim of establishing a conciliation board to resolve future disputes. This was not achieved, but the council endured. Originally, thirteen trade union branches affiliated, but by 1873 it had more than fifty delegates. Even by the 1880s, the council represented only 2,000 workers, but its ability to support unions on strike, campaign for shorter working hours and the municipalisation of utilities, gave it prominent role in the city. Socialists increasingly took leading roles on the council, focusing on organising unskilled workers, and setting up a union of women workers and the Scottish Farm Servants' Union. In 1890, it finally achieved its aim of establishing a conciliation board but, since its rulings were not binding, it achieved little, considering only nine cases by 1906. The council first began electoral activity by opposing the re-election of Lord Provost of Aberdeen George Jamieson. By 1879, it was backing favoured candidates in the School Board election, and it first supported independent labour candidates in the 1885 local elections, with James Forbes and George Maconnachie elected. In 1891, it was a founding affiliate of the Scottish United Trades Councils Labour Party, and sponsored Henry Hyde Champion in Aberdeen South at the 1892 UK general election, although he could only take third place in the poll. At the 1895 UK general election, there was another independent labour candidate, John Lincoln Mahon, but the council eventually decided not to back his candidacy. The council also engaged with the broader trade union movement. It hosted the Trades Union Congress in Aberdeen in 1884, and in 1895 it hosted a meeting of Scottish trade unions and trades councils which led to the formation of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC), in 1897. In 1973, it became the leading organisation in the new Grampian Federation of Trades Councils. Early in its history, the council met at the Queens Rooms on Union Street, but in 1892 it purchased its own headquarters on Belmont Street, and four years later opened a purpose-built trades hall, with murals by Douglas Strachan. It relocated to a former warehouse in 1956, then to its social club, and now once more meets at hired rooms. The trades council continued to grow until 1920, when it reached a peak affiliated membership of 16,684. That year, it formed a council of action to oppose British intervention in the Polish- Soviet War. It co-ordinated local activity during the 1926 UK general strike, then during the 1930s focused on organising workers who were not trade union members. From 1918, the council was known as the Aberdeen Trades and Labour Council, and incorporated the local Labour Party. This arrangement ended in 1935, and it broke all links with the party in 1937 in order to take part in the Communist Party of Great Britain's National Unemployed Workers' Movement and United Front Against Fascism. While a merger with the NUWM was proposed, this did not occur, and the council soon returned to the Labour Party. The council remained prominent in the STUC as the Aberdeen Trades Council and began growing again, membership reaching a new peak of 26,000 in 1980. Since then, its membership has declined in line with the Scottish trade union movement. In 2003, it was officially renamed as the Aberdeen Trades Union Council.

An estimated 502 out of 7,000 people died as a result of this epidemic and resulted in major changes in the city. Cholera is \\"an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the toxigenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 or O139\\".  Lexington, KY  In 1833, Lexington, KY was a city that had approximately 7,000 people living in it. There were farmers who owned slaves who worked as domestic servants and artisans. The major crops that Lexington produced were tobacco and hemp. These crops were distributed across the United States and the globe by ships. Lexington used the Ohio River ports to get their trade ships from Lexington to the Mississippi River and then eventually the Atlantic Ocean where their goods could be transported to Europe. This trade system is hypothesized to be the main reason that the cholera epidemic made its way to the United States and to different states such as Ohio and Kentucky. This illness has sub-Asian roots and due to the trading system throughout the globe, the illness made its way to the United States and eventually to Lexington, KY.  Causes  Cholera is \\"caused by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person that contaminates water and/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water\\". This is an extremely important factor of how the cholera epidemic was able to spread throughout the city of Lexington, KY. There were 7,000 people living in this city and clean water was not a main priority in the 1800s. It is important to note that there were usually wells that farmers and slaves got their water from. These wells were shared by many which made the cholera epidemic nearly impossible to prevent.

The Panjshir Front played a leading role in organizing and coordinating the military and political activities of the fronts by the type of the Islamic Army ‚Äì the Islamic Society of Afghanistan ‚Äì in five (5) northeastern provinces adjacent to Panjshiru: Kunduz, Baghlan, Takhar, Parvan, Kapisa. Later, on the basis of the Panjshir and the northeastern fronts, the so-called \\"Supervisory Council\\" was created, which resolved military-political and economic tasks in organizing the activities of the anti-government forces of the entire region. Later such associations began to be established in the west and south of Afghanistan, the main role in them was played by the Islamic Society of Afghanistan party.  Structure  The expansion of the territory controlled by the Panjshir Front dictated the creation of military and administrative structures simultaneously. There were created: judicial committees, a committee on culture, a council for education and culture, as well as a council of ulama. The Panjshir Front created 22 (twenty-two) bases scattered throughout the length of the valley. In order to help the weak bases, mobile groups were created, capable of entering the battle on the Panjshir before it developed and attacking the enemy in areas beyond the valley. They were sent to help the bases that were subjected to the offensive of the Soviet troops. Each of the bases was located in one of the secondary gorges adjoining the valley and subdivided, in turn, into two main and one auxiliary garrisons; thus, some flexibility was achieved, and it was difficult for the Soviet troops to liquidate the base with a swoop. The composition of the mobile groups was recruited from among the various bases of the Panjshir valley. This approach increased the fighting spirit of the Panjshir people and helped to establish interaction between various bases and minimizing the contradictions that sometimes occurred between the front leadership and the command of some of the bases. In the event of a defeat of a mobile group, such an approach in the formation of its personnel contributed to a more even distribution of losses between different bases, rather than their concentration in one area. During the fighting during the nine months of 1982, 1983 ‚Äì the leadership of the Panjshir Front, using the acquired combat experience, divided the members of the bases into members of strike groups and employees, rear and economic issues. The formation of a supervisory board and the unification of the activities of the leadership of the Panjshir Front with the activities of this council, which included 50 of the most experienced Panjshir warriors and 50 rebels from other fronts, subsequently contributed to the formation of the leadership of the so-called Islamic army on their basis. Each of the rebel groups consisted of 32 (thirty) armed, trained and equipped soldiers. The armament of this group consisted of two RPG-7 hand grenade launchers, one PK machine gun and AK-47 assault rifles. At the head of the group was the commander with his deputy. The main group, in turn, was divided into three smaller ones, ten (thirteen) each, one of whom was its commander. This group was able to conduct offensive and defensive actions and be in reserve.  The tasks of the Front  The leadership of the Panjshir Front since the beginning of the armed struggle was focused on expanding the territory of military operations against the OKVA. To achieve this result was possible: the distribution of weapons, financial assistance, combat training ‚Äì directing to neighboring fronts, to enhance combat experience and skills. The main political task of the Panjshir Front was to represent a symbol of Afghan resistance.  Geographical position  Panjshir Gorge is an extended, narrow valley, surrounded, on both sides enclosed by high mountains. On both sides to it adjoins set of small gorges. It is located to the north-east of Kabul, the capital of the DRA and borders on the provinces: Parvan, Kapisa, Lagman, Badakhshan, Takhar and Baghlan. There are two strategic points with the Panjshir: Salang, called the people's throat Kabul and the military airfield Bagram. The Panjshir Front actively used this intimacy in the fight against ACVA and the Government forces. In this regard, the leaders of the front came to the conclusion that one of the main tasks is to establish unity of action between territorially close fronts.  Prior events  With the introduction of Soviet troops into Afghanistan, in order to organize guerrilla warfare in the central and north-eastern part of the country, a single combat command, the spiritual leader Burhanuddin Rabbani and the largest field commander Ahmad Shah Massoud (A.Sh. Masud), the Panjshir Front was established ‚Äì the advanced combat unit of the IAO party. To fight the Government in Kabul and the Soviet troops, the IOA among the \\"Seven Islamic parties\\", more commonly known as the Peshawar Seven Union, received significant financial and military assistance ‚Äì as part of the secret operation \\"Cyclone\\" from the US CIA, as well as a number of Western European countries; states of the Islamic world and the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and others. However, despite extensive external financial assistance, the Panjshir Front mobilized all available domestic economic resources in the valley, took full control over the extraction of all minerals in the valley. Significant funds came to the IOA budget from the development of deposits of emeralds. In the mining areas of silver in the rock, a large number of abandoned mines formed resembling a sieve with a large number of holes. Later on in these mines the support and observation posts of the Panjshir people were equipped. The gorge served as a convenient transport corridor for the supply of arms and ammunition from Pakistan by packs of transport, as well as a place for the organization of training bases for rebels, both in the valley itself and in the adjacent ones.  Logistics support  The success of the Panjshir Front is largely due to the formation of the rear reserves. In the upper part of the valley there are significant deposits of emeralds. The population of these regions from time immemorial led their development, the income received from the sale of realized rough jewelry, in the amount of 20% transferred to the Panjshir Front. In the upper reaches of the Panjshir canyon, in Pavat, in the villages: Pirjah, Mabain, Zaradhak ‚Äì 10-13 kilometers southeast and east of the settlement Pishgor, each of which was concentrated from 20 to 40 mines, as well as in the Darkhin gorge. The population of this region existed with funds from the sale of emeralds and paid a quitrile from the mined stones to the treasury of the panjshir front. The emerald, extracted in the valley, was transported to Pakistan for processing, and from there it was distributed all over the world. The amount of funds raised for emeralds, on average per year was up to $10 million. Mining on rocky grounds was carried out by Japanese drilling rigs with the involvement of Western European engineers. In addition to the extraction of emeralds, Ahmad Shah Massoud's supporters in Dzharm county in Badakhshan province extracted lapis lazuli. In addition to mining precious and semiprecious stones, silver mines have been developed in the lower reaches of the Panjshir Gorge in the Jary-ab region since ancient times. The extracted silver was sent to the Andarab valley, which came in contact with the Panjshir, where silver products were made from it. In order to replenish the treasury of the Panjshir Front, a decision was made to collect taxes from the Panjshir population: from the harvest of agricultural crops; with income from the mining industry ‚Äì extraction of emeralds and lapis lazuli; a five per cent tax levied on the salaries of civil servants and the incomes of artisans. The proceeds from these proceeds were transferred to the financial committee that was available at each rebel base. = The bases of the Panjshir Front = According to Abd Al-Hafiz Mansur, an Afghan historian, a panjshirzer describing the activities of the Panjshir Front, he had bases in the valley: Parian, Khawak, Dasht-i Ravat, Safid Chehr, Hanch, Pashgur, Am-times, Astana, Paranda, Chamalurda, Tavah, Anaba, Zamankur, Shotal, Da-ra-yi Khazar, Sadakh va Karaman, Abdullah-Heil, Manjhur, Talha wa Mala, Hasarak, Abdara, Faraj.  Panjshirsky and North-Eastern fronts  At the initial stage of the Afghan war, in a limited theater of military operations ‚Äì Soviet troops were opposed by a few detachments of mujahedin, formed on the basis of clan, tribal and religious (Sunnis, Shiites, Ismailis) belonging. Groupings, vying and often, openly enmity, with each other. The split of the opposition was in the hands of Soviet military intelligence officers and was used in the interests of the troops. And yet, in the face of the approaching large-scale military operations from the Soviet troops, the unity between the conflicting opposition parties was temporarily, nevertheless, established. Discarding all existing contradictions and strife, the disparate formations acted as a united front. In the future, for effective command and control of troops and logistics, the leaders of the party IOA, a plan of struggle was developed. He consisted in uniting the armed detachments along the entire length of the Panjshir Gorge into a powerful strike force, known as the Panjshir Front (PF). The PF was well organized in terms of combat command and logistics. On the basis of the PF, the IOA party set a goal to make it a symbol of the entire Afghan resistance. The leading role of the PF consisted in the planning, organization and management of the operations of the IAO units in the central, north-eastern and western parts of the country, in close cooperation with other rebel fronts, in the likeness of a regular army. The commanders of the IAO formations of the \\"center\\" and \\"north-east\\" group came to the need to reach an agreement on full interaction, and depending on the evolving situation, and to unified combat management of the neighboring fronts. The resulting combat experience with their feat to the formation of the two main fronts ‚Äì \\"panjshir\\" and \\"northeast\\". The reason for this is the effectiveness of the use of forces and means, as well as control over the spending of financial resources allocated by foreign sponsors to guerrilla warfare in a particular region, and the desire to achieve leadership in the competition for the volume of distributed external assistance. Equally with the IOA, a \\"pro-Pashtun\\" Islamic Party of Afghanistan (IPA), formed three months earlier than the IOA, in 1973 in the city of Peshawar (Pakistan), the spiritual leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, held a strong position in the north- eastern region. IPA is the second major political party in the Union of Mujahideen of Afghanistan, or the Peshawar Seven.  Conflict with the Islamic Party of Afghanistan  The degree of influence of the IPA of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in the north-eastern and northern provinces of Afghanistan, due to the large number of Pashtun living in the region that inhabited this region in the 19th and 20th centuries, was also high. The mass resettlement of Pashtun to the northern provinces of the country ‚Äì Afghanistan's Turkestan, Kattagan (a historical region in the north-east of the country) and Badakhshan, from the places of their traditional residence (eastern, south-eastern and southern provinces) at the turn of the century was called \\"Pushtunization\\" of the northern territories. It was aimed at blocking the threats of separatism at the northern borders and strengthening the power of the rulers of the Emirate (Pashtun by nationality) over the local ‚Äì \\"non-Pashtun\\" population: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other peoples. At different times, the supply of the Panjshir Front in Andarab, Najrab and Kukhistan was blocked by the detachments of the Islamic Party of Afghanistan. This led to the fact that in the Panjshir valley from the center of the Islamic Society of Afghanistan in Peshawar (Pakistan) foreign aid was no longer supplied: weapons, equipment and food, paralyzing the activities of the detachments of the IOA A.Sh. Masud. \\"Several times I sent my people to Andarab to agree on the opening of the road to Havak, but other \\"Islamic parties\\", among which there are no true Muslims, did not condescend to our requests. On the contrary, they only exacerbate our plight by demanding money from soiled, hungry and unfortunate people for soap and matches. In the area of Hesar Field (district of Andarab county, where Gulbetdin Hekmatyar's IPA detachments were based, a footnote from the text), they mocked the Panjshirts and each of them was imprisoned for several days. Delivery of goods to us from Peshawar can not be carried out due to the blocking of the road in Saidhail\\" (the area of the province of Parwan ‚Äì a footnote from the text) ‚Äî A.Sh. Masud in a letter to the emissary to Dr. Iskhak 24 December 1982  Supervisory board  The Panjshir Front played a leading role in organizing and coordinating the activities of the fronts in five (5) northern provinces adjacent to Panjshiru: Kunduz, Baghlan, Takhar, Parvan, Kapisa. On their basis, the so-called Supervisory Council was created, which resolved military-political and economic tasks. \\"Panjshir Front\\" under the command of A.Sh. Masuda was given the leading role. Later such associations began to be established in the west and south of Afghanistan, the main role was assigned to the party Islamic Society of Afghanistan. The NA IO, as the main body, solved the entire range of military and political tasks facing the fronts: worked out a plan for the upcoming military operations, established interaction between the commanders' actions, organized logistical support (armament, ammunition, equipment, food) and distributed financial resources. The Supervisory Council reorganized the existing structure of the armed formations and began to establish an \\"Islamic army\\" (IA). The application of the IA was designed for various armed conflicts, raids on communications and public authorities. Of great importance in the activity of the IA was the struggle for the minds and hearts of ordinary and illiterate Afghans, agitation and propaganda among the personnel of Afghan government forces: the army, the police, the security forces.

It is one of several lists of U.S. pipeline accidents. See also list of natural gas and oil production accidents in the United States.   Incidents  This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. For natural gas alone, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987. A \\"significant incident\\" results in any of the following consequences: * fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization * $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars * liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel) * releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10.

PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation- reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. * On January 5, 2008, a pipeline ruptured at a filet weld, leaking natural gasoline in Oologah, Oklahoma. About 45,000 gallons of the gasoline were spilled, with about 29,000 gallons being lost. * On January 7, a pipeline split open, near Denver City, Texas, spilling of crude oil. The pipeline company failed to detect and stop the leak for more than 24 hours. ERW seam failure appears to be the cause. * On January 11, a Belle Fourche maintenance crew damaged its own pipeline, spilling about 11,100 gallons of crude in Alexander, North Dakota. * On February 5, a natural gas pipeline compressor station exploded and caught fire, near Hartsville, Tennessee, and was believed to have been caused by a tornado hitting the facility. * On February 15, a 20-inch distillate pipeline exploded and burned in Hidalgo County, Texas, closing road FM490. * On March 14, a house in a Columbia, Missouri neighborhood exploded in an explosion that could be felt for miles, causing fatal injuries to the elderly couple living there. Problems with the gas distribution line there were blamed for the explosion. Another house nearby also suffered damage. * On May 16, a crew boring to install a new gas main hit an existing 4-inch gas line in McKinney, Texas. Escaping gas caused two houses to explode, and one other house to catch fire. Three people were burned from this incident. * On July 28, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois ordered Apex Oil Company Inc., to clean up ground water and soil contamination, at an expected cost of at least $150 million. During the period 1967 through 1988, Apex Oil's legal predecessor, Clark Oil and Refining Corp., released gasoline from leaking pipelines and other spills, that commingled with other responsible parties' releases and resulted in the large plume of refined petroleum substances beneath Hartford, Illinois. Vapors from the underground plume of millions of gallons of leaked and spilled petroleum products have migrated into houses in the village, causing years of fires, explosions, and evacuations. * On August 10, a 20-inch crude oil pipeline ruptured near Golden Gate, Illinois. About 243,000 gallons of crude were spilled, with about 33,000 gallons being lost. The cause was listed as a pipe seam failure. * On August 25, a 24-inch gas transmission pipeline failed in a rural area west of Pilot Grove, Missouri. The longitudinal rupture in the pipe body created a 50 foot by 33-foot by 7-foot deep crater in the ground. The cause of the rupture was external corrosion. * On August 28, a 36-inch gas pipeline failed near Stairtown, Texas, causing a fire with flames tall. The failure was caused by external corrosion. * On August 29, a 24-inch gas transmission pipeline ruptured in Cooper County, Missouri. Corrosion had caused the pipeline to lose 75% of its wall thickness in the failure area. * On September 9, workers constructing a new pipeline hit an existing natural gas pipeline in Wheeler County, Texas. Two workers were burned by this accident. * On September 14, a 30-inch Williams Companies gas pipeline ruptured and gas ignited near Appomattox, Virginia. Two houses were destroyed by the fire. External corrosion was the cause of the failure. * On September 23, a ruptured pipeline caused a fire at a Pipeline Terminal in Pasadena, Texas. One worker was killed, and another injured, with about of product being lost. The failure was caused by internal corrosion. * On October 3, a crew working on a Turnpike expansion drilled into a Colonial Pipeline petroleum products pipeline, in Hamilton, New Jersey. About 35,000 gallons of diesel fuel were spilled, with 100 gallons not recovered. * On October 3, construction equipment hit a Mid Valley Pipeline Company pipeline in Florence, Kentucky, spilling about 153,000 gallons of crude oil. * On the night of November 15, a gas compressor for a pipeline at an entry exploded and burned near Godley, Texas. The fire spread to another company's gas compressor station next to it. A 24-inch gas pipeline had to be shut down to stop the fire. There were no injuries, and damages were estimated at $2 million. * On November 25, a gasoline release from a Sunoco petroleum pipeline occurred, near a retail mall in Murrysville, Pennsylvania. Officials said the release occurred from the 6-inch line at about 9:30 a.m. while a Sunoco Logistics crew was working on a ball valve. It was suspected the ball valve was improperly installed. The failure resulted in the evacuation of numerous stores, restaurants and roads in the immediate vicinity due to the dousing of gasoline and subsequent vapors emitting from the of spilled product. * On December 5, a driver of a vehicle went off of a road, and struck a valve on an AMOCO gasoline pipeline in Colon, Michigan. The driver was killed, and, the fire burned for several days. About 14,000 gallons of gasoline were burned, or lost.

Biography  Fokin was born in 1935. After graduating high school, he went to serve in the army, and began working at the Novosibirsk Semiconductor Devices Plant after his discharge. Fokin was a leader, and later became a labor veteran. In the later 1950s he married, and had children. His life turned around abruptly in 1988, when his wife died. By this time Fokin had aged considerably and suffered from hearing loss, but had a great potency that attracted women to him. During this period, he tried to improve his personal life, but then began to have sex with cheap prostitutes, tramps and alcoholics. But by the mid-1990s, Fokin became impotent, a factor which greatly worried him. The first murder Fokin committed was in April 1996 (according to some sources in December 1995).–ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ ¬´–ö–æ–º–º–µ—Å–∞–Ω—Ç—ä¬ª He killed mostly women aged between 18 and 55 years, but the age did not matter much. As victims, he chose women and girls without a specific place of residence, mostly alcohol abusers and prostitutes, the choice being explained by the fact that nobody would look for these people if they disappeared. Fokin confessed that he asked his future victims for any relatives, and, as a rule, chose single women. Indeed, the remains of all nine known victims of Fokin were never identified and it was not possible to identify any of his ten known victims. The murder scenario was always the following: Fokin got acquainted with the victim in the Railway Square, brought them home, where he raped and mercilessly killed them. The murder methods were always different: some were strangled, others were drowned in the bathroom, and some stabbed. After the death of each victim, Fokin dismembered the corpse, and threw it in the garbage container. The last murder Fokin committed was on March 5, 2000. Having dismembered a corpse in the bathroom, the remains were thrown into a trash container in Timiryazev Street near his home. During the day, a man came to the Zaeltsovskoye Police Department, who had found a bloody bag of sugar with human organs. Operative-search activities were carried out with an incredible scope: in the area where the dismembered body was found, hundreds of houses and thousands of apartments were inspected, there was intensive work with witnesses, external surveillance and ambushes were organized. Fokin was detained between March 7 and 15, 2000.–¢–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞ –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ö –Ω–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è When his house was searched, a lot of female items were found.

The family later served the archbishop of Veliky Novgorod, and subsequently integrated into the Ryazanian nobility.  History  The Lyapunovs are immediately descended from Ivan Borisovich Lyapun Osinin, whose direct male ancestor was Prince Konstantin Yaroslavich of Galich. Their ancestors ruled in the Principality of Galich (an appanage of the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality), until Duke Dmitry Donskoy annexed their domain in 1362 and ejected Prince Dmitry Ivanovich of Galich. Having been deprived of his principality, Prince Dmitry Ivanovich fled to Veliky Novgorod where he entered the service to the local archbishop. His son, Prince Vladimir Dmitrievich, continued to serve the archbishop of Novgorod. His great-grandsons were no longer styled princes and were considered boyars of the Novgorodian archbishop. Their sons, the great- grandsons of Prince Vladimir Dmitrievich, namely, Dmitry Beryoza (meaning birch), Semyon Osina (meaning aspen) and Ivan Iva (meaning willow), were the progenitors of the Beryozin, Osinin, Ivin and Ilyin noble families. The grandson of Semyon Osina, Lyapun Osinin, is considered the founder of the Lyapunovs. One of the latter's grandsons entered the service of the Dukes of Ryazan, when the Lyapunov family joined the Ryazanian nobility. Pyotr Savvich Lyapunov, the voivode at Cheboksary, had five sons, who were active participants in the Time of Troubles. The Lyapunovs are listed in the Velvet Book and in Part 6 (Ancient Nobility) of the Kaluga, Kostroma, Moscow, Nizhny- Novgorod and Ryazan Governorates genealogical books.

Biography It is unknown when Gismondi was born. The suggestion that Gismondi, about whom nothing was knowing prior to her arrival in London in 1732, was the same as Resse, was first proposed by Strohm in 1985 (R. Strohm, Essays on Handel and Italian opera, Cambridge). The first traces we find of the career of Resse was in Naples in April 1722, where she sang in the Teatro dei Fiorentini in the comedic opera La noce de Veneviento by Francesco Feo. She performed later the same year in Lo castiello saccheato, and in 1723 in Lo labborinto, both by Leonardo Vinci. Because her name didn't appear in the original programmes for the operas, it has been speculated that she was still a minor at the time, placing her birth in the first decade of the 1700s. She then moved in 1725 to the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples, where the more serious opera's were staged. There she sang in most productions until early 1732, often together with the bass Gioacchino Corrado; she replaced Santa Marchesini who had moved to Venice. During these years Resse sang the comic interludes in opera's by Johann Adolf Hasse, Leonardo Leo, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, and Vinci. John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey saw her in Naples in 1729 and probably played a significant role in bringing her to London, where she was under the name Celeste Gismondi the second singer in the company of George Frideric Handel at the Queen's Theatre, where Anna Maria Strada was the prima donna. The first known performance was in November 1732, in the pasticchio opera Catone. After one season she went to the Opera of the Nobility, the new rival company set up by Nicola Porpora, where she performed as prima or secunda donna during the 1733-34 season. She was married to a Mr. Hempson. She died in London on 11 March 1735, having fallen ill after the 1733-1734 season.

Career  = Early career = A 2004 batch officer from the Tamil Nadu Cadre, Garg began his police career at Tirupattur in the Vellore district as the Assistant Superintendent of Police. = Superintendent of Police = In 2008, Garg was appointed as the Superintendent of Police of Tirunelveli district (Rural), where he held office until 2010. During that period, Garg played a proactive role in managing the usury menace, and played a vital role in saving the people from the money lenders who were charging exorbitant interest rates; he formed a special force to track down and curtail the activities of moneylenders who used goons to collect loans. Rather than waiting for complaints against any kind of crime, Garg made his team go out and find willing complainants. Garg was also appreciated for curbing other criminal operations and maintaining the peace in the communally sensitive area. In 2010, Garg was posted as the Superintendent of Police at the Madurai district, where he set out to fight against corruption and money distribution during the election. The conduct of elections by him was appreciated by election commission of India. He also helped to resolve a major, long-standing communal conflict. He initiated peace negotiations between the warring Dalits and non- dalits in the village of Uthapuram and ensured the entry of Dalits in the temple.

Garg is known for being humane and innovative in dealing with crimes. One such instance was the release of a woman who had murdered her husband. During the probe, police found out that the man was killed when he attempted to rape their daughter. Following this, Garg ordered her release under section 100 of IPC, holding that the woman, acted in self defense. This brought national attention on the case as an instance of law being not blind after all. In 2013, Garg was commended for preventing the marriage of an HIV infected man with a young girl in Devadanapatti in Theni District of Tamil Nadu a few minutes before her marriage. Garg also played a key role in the first conviction in the state in a case of land grabbing which was a very pertinent issue at that time. Besides, in Dharmapuri, Garg busted a kidney trade racket in 2013 by making several arrests and nabbing the kingpin, Garg brought an end to the organ grafting racket, which was one of the crimes with the highest gravity.

Four children on the cart were killed, and two were seriously injured. Stint carts were subsequently banned from use on public roads in the Netherlands. An investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing. Accident On 20 September 2018 a passenger train was involved in a level crossing collision at Oss, near Nijmegen in the Southern part of the Netherlands. Four children were killed, with two further serious injuries; one a child and one adult. child transport and operator stand The infrastructure operator of the rail line, ProRail, started an investigation into the accident. The children involved had been travelling to school in a Stint cargo bike-style electrically-powered cart. Initial reports from the scene reported that the barriers and level crossing lights were working correctly. The level crossing at Oss West railway station has been the location of six accidents since 1975. The seven-car Stadler FLIRT train was operating passenger service 6722 which had departed from Den Bosch () at 08:12 towards Oss. Responses The head of Nederlandse Spoorwegen, CEO Roger van Boxtel travelled back early from the InnoTrans rail exhibition in Berlin. On 21 September 2018 the child care organisation that operated the Stint temporarily halted the use of the transporters, awaiting the findings of the investigation. Some other child care organisations in the Netherlands also paused the use of Stint transporters. On 1 October, Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen banned Stint vehicles from public roads in the Netherlands, a move described as unjustified by Edwin Renzer, owner of Stint Urban Mobility. On 29 October, Stint Urban Mobility filed for bankruptcy. Investigation Oss West station and the train were both fitted with closed-circuit television cameras, enabling this footage to be used during the investigation. On 23 September 2018, De Telegraaf reported that the investigation included the possibility of electromagnetic interference from the level crossing equipment affecting the electrical control system of the Stint. In July 2019, it was reported that the driver of the Stint cart had been found not to have been at fault.

Overview  Version 0.1 of IVEware was developed in the late 1990s by Trivellore Raghunathan, Peter W. Solenberger, and John Van Hoewyk and released in 1997 as beta software with an official release in 2002 from the Survey Research Center, University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Version 0.2 was released in 2011 and the newest version, V 0.3, was released in 2017. The software includes seven modules: IMPUTE, BBDESIGN, DESCRIBE, REGRESS, SASMOD, SYNTHESIZE, and COMBINE. IVEware can be run with SAS, Stata, R, SPSS or as a stand-alone tool under the Windows or Linux environment. The R, Stata, SPSS and stand-alone version can also be used with the Mac OS. The stand-alone version has limited capabilities for analyzing multiply imputed data though the routines for creating imputations are the same across all packages. And the command structure is the same across all platforms. IVEware can be executed using the built-in XML editor or it can be run using the built-in editor within the four software packages previously mentioned. The user can also mix and match the codes from these software packages through a standard XML toggle-parser (for example, < SAS name = ‚Äúmyfile‚Äù > SAS commands < /SAS > will execute the SAS commands and store the commands in the file ‚Äúmyfile.sas‚Äù.) if the provided XML editor is used to execute IVEware commands.

This object is notable for being the most luminous source of hard X-rays in the Andromeda Galaxy. This is also the most luminous source known that shows dips in the X-ray light curve. The compact object in this system has been unambiguously identified as a neutron star with a spin period of 3 seconds. Identification of the source The Swift BAT all-sky survey detected hard X-rays (in the energy range 14-195 keV) in the direction of M31 and found that this emission was centered in a region 6 arcseconds away from the galaxy center. Using a subsequent NuSTAR observation, it was found that a single source was responsible for this emission, and optical HST images ruled out the presence of stars more massive than 3 solar masses in that direction. The same source was earlier observed in soft X-rays by XMM-Newton, and was given the catalogue name 3XMM J004232.1+411314. By analysing archival data elaborated by the EXTraS project, this source showed dips (a short and linear decrease in the source luminosity, which returns subsequently at the previous luminosity level) in some observations. As this behaviour is typical of X-ray binaries, then this source can be identified as a low-mass X-ray binary. System properties The orbit of this binary system has an inclination between 60¬∞ and 80¬∞ from our line of sight, since dips are observed only in this inclination range. The orbital period of the system is 4.01 hours, which is the same distance in time between two consecutive dips. Like many others low- mass X-ray binaries, the luminosity of this source varies over time. Using XMM-Newton observations of Andromeda Galaxy, this source luminosity stays in the range 0.8‚Äì2.8 erg/s in the 0.2-12 keV photon energy band. To date, this is the most luminous source that shows dips in its X-ray lightcurves. The compact object of this system is a neutron star with a spin period of 3 seconds, and this is proved by the observation of a modulation with the same period in the X-ray luminosity.

The shooting occurred 30 miles northeast of Baltimore. This was the second mass shooting in Maryland in 2018, following the Capital Gazette shooting.  Incident  The suspect had entered the facility to report to work as usual, before opening fire on victims inside and outside of the facility. The Harford County sheriff stated that calls of \\"shots fired\\" came from the Rite Aid distribution center at approximately 9:06 am. EDT. Deputies responded at 9:09 am. Officers reportedly never discharged their weapons while responding to the scene. Agents from the Baltimore offices of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the FBI responded to the scene.  Victims  Preliminary reports suggest that at least three people were killed in the attack, although the Harford County Sheriff declined to give a precise number of wounded and deceased victims during the press conference. Two victims died at the scene and a two in the hospital. It was later reported that the suspect died at the hospital due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to her head. Victims were transported to Johns Hopkins Bayview Hospital in Baltimore and Christiana Hospital in Delaware. Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Trauma Director released a statement that the hospital received four victims with gunshot wounds, and by 2:30 pm.

It has geyish green, lance- to egg- shaped leaves ending in a thickened tip. The flower heads and subtending leaves form a cylindric inflorescence, topped by ordinary, more or less upright leaves. Each primarily orange flowerhead contains 10‚Äì13 flowers with conspicuously scarlet styles, yellow under the narrow hourglass-like pollen presenter at its tip. Flowers can usually be found from mid-June till December, peaking in August. It is called conical pagoda in English and skraalstompie in Afrikaans.  Description  Mimetes capitulatus is an evergreen, rounded shrub of about 2 m (7 ft) high that develops from a single trunk, and has a densely branched crown. Older specimens also develop several, usually unbranched straggling shoots. The branches are 5‚Äì8 mm (0.20‚Äì0.32 in) thick and are initially covered with greyish felty hairs that wear off later on. The leaves are set alternately along the branches, slightly overlapping at an upward angle. They lack stipules and leaf stalks, are lance- to egg-shaped in outline, 2‚Äì3¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.4 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.8 in) wide, with an entire margin ending sharply pointy in one thickened tip. The surface is initially covered in rough felty hairs, which eventually are lost. The inflorescence is broadly cylinder-shaped, 6‚Äì10 cm (2‚Öì‚Äì4 in) long and 6‚Äì8 cm (2‚Öì‚Äì3¬º in) in diameter, topped by more or less upright leaves not unlike all other leaves. In the axils of the higher leaves are flower heads each containing ten to thirteen (most frequently eleven) flowers, the subtending leaves broadly oval, 2¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1‚Äì1¬æ in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì2 (‚Öî‚Äì¬æ in) broad, set with rough hairs, and with a row of rough hairs along the margin, sometimes flushed reddish. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are upright, softly hairy, greenish white in colour but flushed with red, very narrowly lance-shaped to line-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.6‚Äì1.0 in) long and 3‚Äì6 mm (0.12‚Äì0.24 in) wide, the inner whorl lance-shaped to narrowly lance-shaped, with a sharply pointy tip, 1¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (‚Öî‚Äì1¬æ in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm (‚Öì‚Äì‚Öî in) wide, orange to red in colour, hyaline in consistency and hairless towards the tip, powdery hairy towards the base. The bract subtending the individual flower is orange to red in colour, narrowly lance-shaped with a pointy tip and 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (about 1¬º in) long, about ¬Ω‚Äì1 cm (‚Öì in) wide, hairless at the base and powdery hairy towards the tip, with a row of hairs along the edge. The 4-merous perianth is 3‚Äì4 cm (1.2‚Äì1.6 in) long. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is slightly inflated and hairless at the base, and about 5‚Äì7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) long. The segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread- shaped and silky hairy. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are line-shaped with a pointy tip and covered in dense silky hairs. The anthers are directly merged to the limbs, lack a filament, and are about 4 mm (0.16 in) long. From the centre of the perianth emerges the style of 4¬Ω‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.8‚Äì2.2 in) long, growing and curving when the flower opens and stretching out later on. It is scarlet in colour with yellow near the tip. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is 5‚Äì7 mm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) long, with a narrow hourglass- like shape, with a thickened ring at the base, a narrow middle part and a cone- to head-shaped tip that contains the sigmatic groove across the middle. The ovary is silky hairy and about 2 mm long (0.08 in). It is subtended by four fleshy, blunt line-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The fruit is powdery hairy, cylinder-shaped, 5‚Äì6 mm (0.20‚Äì0.24 in) long and 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) in diameter.  Taxonomy  As far as known, the first person to collect the conical pagoda for science was William Roxburgh, who came across this species in 1798 or 1799. He however did not specify the location of his find. The species was described by Robert Brown in 1810, who named it Mimetes capitulatus, in a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae. In 1816, Jean Poiret collapsed several genera, including Mimetes and made the new combination Protea capitulata. = Naming = The species name capitulatus means little head.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Habit. Photo: TonyRebelo.The five known populations of the conical pagoda can be found in the Kogelberg, Kleinrivier and Groenland Mountains, ranges adjacent or at least near the sea, at 600‚Äì1200 m (2000‚Äì4000 ft) altitude. The average annual precipitation is about 1500 mm (60 in) mostly falling during the southern winter. Here it grows on permanently moist, sometimes outright swampy peaty soils, near the ridge or peak on the cool, southeastern slope in a vegetation that also contains the Restionid Elegia mucronata, Klattia partita, and the Bruniaceae species Berzelia ecklonii and Brunia alopecuroides. In these locations clouds condensate and cause precipitation during the otherwise dry summer months. The species is pollinated by birds, mostly the malachite sunbird Nectarinia famosa, southern double-collared sunbird Cinnyris chalybeus and orange-breasted sunbird Anthobaphes violacea. It flowers from mid June to November, with a peak in August, and produces copious amounts of nectar. The fruits ripen one at a time, two to six months after flowering and fall to the ground. They are collected by native ants that carry the fruits to their underground nest, where the ants bread is eaten and the seeds remain protected. The seeds germinate after an overhead fieldfire. Plants do not survive fires.  Conservation  The conical pagoda is considered an endangered species, due to the very limited areas where its populations occupy within a distribution area of and its decreasing population. Negative impacts may arise from too high frequency wildfires, flower picking, and habitat destruction.

The facility was originally operating on channel 240 (95.9 MHz), but relocated to channel 227 (93.3 MHz) in the early 80s to allow 95.7 at Houston (known as KIKK-FM at the time) to relocate from Shell Plaza in downtown Houston to the Senior Road tower near Missouri City. This allowed other spectrum changes. For example, in 1995 a new sign-on of 95.9 KHMC occurred in nearby Goliad, Texas. Victoria Radio Works acquired the facility in October 1998.

The New York City native is president of Hollander Design Landscape Architects, a New York-based firm incorporating environmental planning, landscape design and horticulture which has provided services for residential, commercial and public projects. Hollander has taught extensively at the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the University of Pennsylvania and at City College of New York. The cornerstone of Hollander's landscape practice is his theory of The Three Ecologies: Ecology of site, Human Ecology, and the Ecology of Architecture. As Hollander wrote in the introduction to his most recent book The Good Garden: ‚ÄúA powerful landscape unfolds like a story. Your land is your home and within your home is the house.\\" Life and career development =Early Years and Education= Edmund Hollander was born on September 3, 1954 in New York City and grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His mother, Jean Kopelman, was a television producer in New York. His father, Alvin L. Hollander Jr., was an executive at WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. He attended Vassar College from 1972-1976 and received a bachelor's degree in history and botany, then studied ecology and horticulture for three years at the New York Botanical Gardens School of Professional Horticulture. In 1983 he earned in his master's degree in landscape architecture with a focus on ecology from the University of Pennsylvania. = Design Influences = At Penn, he studied with Ian McHarg, the Glasgow-born urban planner and ecologist, whose book Design with Nature revolutionized the way landscape architects can shape the land. McHarg taught his students to look at each site as a cross-section of layers: topography, soils, geology, climate. In the studio, they practiced his ‚Äúlayer cake‚Äù technique of overlapping transparent sheets of Mylar, each with a schematic of hydrology, soil, and areas of forest, marshland or fragile dunes. Other masters of design who taught at Penn, including Arthur Edwin Bye and Laurie Olin, challenged the Penn graduate students to consider every aspect of how people live in a particular place and to think about design holistically considering a site's cultural history and its place in the community, along with the site's built elements. = Personal = Hollander was married to Wendy Powers on June 20, 1992, at the Piping Rock Beach Club; the couple has a daughter, Renata. They own Freddy, a rescued schnoodle. They live in Sag Harbor and New York City.  Career  After graduating from Penn, Hollander first worked at the Delta Group in Philadelphia, then was recruited by the firm of Clarke & Rapuano in New York City. There he worked on commissions such as the Westway Waterfront Park on Manhattan's West Side and a new ecologically based corporate headquarters for Merck Pharmaceuticals. Simultaneously, he was developing his residential design practice with Penn classmate Maryanne Connelly. =Hollander Design Landscape Architects= In 1991 Hollander founded Hollander Design Landscape Architects with Connelly. Hollander Design has offices in New York, Chicago and Sag Harbor, N.Y., and a staff of 25 environmental planners, landscape architects and horticulturists. The firm has created hundreds of landscapes, both public and private, around the world, and usually manages about 30 projects at any one time. The company's portfolio concentrates on the greater New York area including a number of summer homes on Long Island's East End as well as a roster of New York City urban multi- family dwellings. = Design Approach = Hollander believes each landscape can be analyzed by studying its three ecologies: The site's natural ecology, including topography, soil and climate; the architectural ecology of the house as it will appear in the future, along with related structures; and its human ecology, meaning the many ways in which people will use the property. ‚ÄúThe three ecologies essential to a timeless project,‚Äù he explained to Architectural Digest, ‚Äúare the architectural ecology of the buildings, the natural ecology of the vernacular landscape, and the human ecology of how the clients will inhabit the landscapes we create.‚Äù He consults with the architect involved in designing a new home or remodeling an existing structures, as well as the homeowner and family, \\"envisioning their lifestyle and finding out what‚Äôs already there that they love.\\" When designing a landscape, Hollander focuses on what plants and trees are appropriate for the land, favoring native species and those that will survive in the existing soils. However, he also knows that landscaping are living things, and plans for those changes to come. Hollander, writes J. Michael Welton in Ocean Home magazine, \\"views his profession's commitment to every landscape as akin to the Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm. He seeks to work with the natural ecology of a site, the human ecology of his client and the architectural ecology of the building.\\" = Teaching career = Hollander has taught at the City College of New York and in the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the University of Pennsylvania, where he serves on the Dean's Council and has frequently lectured. = Professional Associations = * Member and past president of the New York Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects. * Member of the American Society of Landscape Architects; elected as an ASLA Fellow in 2009. * Serves on the Dean's Council of the Graduate School of Fine Arts at the University of Pennsylvania and the Advisory Board of the Ian L.

It was edited by Frederic Ramsey, Jr. and Charles Edward Smith, and was published by Harcourt, Brace & Company in 1939. It was the first jazz history book published in the United States, and helped establish a story of early jazz as well as renewing interest in those forms of music and their players. Background Frederic Ramsey, Jr. was employed by Harcourt, Brace & Company, and in 1937 was asked to read a manuscript that been submitted by the musician Ted Lewis. Unimpressed by Lewis's claim to have been a jazz pioneer, the young editor reported to his superior that he could write a better history of the music than Lewis had. The senior editor then suggested that he do so. \\"In the spring of 1939, the jazz writer Charles Edward Smith spent several weeks in New Orleans, as part of the research he and other writers were doing for the book Jazzmen. He found the inspiration for his writing not only by talking with the veteran musicians who could take him back to the old days, but also by hanging out in the clubs that still were open\\". Authors and contents \\"Nine writers contributed chapters to the book ‚Äì Charles Edward Smith, Frederic Ramsey Jr., William Russell, Stephen W. Smith, E. Sims Campbell, Edward J. Nichols, Wilder Hobson, Otis Ferguson, and Roger Pryor Dodge\\". The book was edited by Charles Edward Smith and Ramsey. The topics of the chapters included: Bix Beiderbecke; boogie woogie; and jazz played by white musicians in Chicago. Charles Edward Smith wrote \\"the highly charged romantic evocations of the scene for each of the four settings of the book: New Orleans, Chicago, New York, and the jazz environment everywhere in the United States.\\" The first section of the book ‚Äì \\"Callin' Our Chillun' Home\\" ‚Äì \\"created what has become the legendary account of the development of early jazz\\". There are no footnotes giving sources. Publication Jazzmen was published by Harcourt, Brace & Company in 1939. It was the first book on jazz history to be published in the United States. Influence One purpose of Jazzmen was to trace the origins of jazz, which was done in part by trying to find information about cornetist Buddy Bolden. Much of the account of Bolden's life that is presented in the book was later shown to be inaccurate. According to writer Samuel Charters: > The story that emerged in the book's pages would not have achieved such > immediate acceptance if it didn't fill a need for a myth. For its editors > and writers it was an act of faith to create a story that would lend the > beginnings of jazz in New Orleans a closer indebtedness to black musical > sources. The book also helped renew interest in an early form of jazz: > what followed over the next half century was a flood of recordings of what > came to be known as the music of the New Orleans Revival. Within a few > months of its publication there was interest in finding and perhaps > recording some of the musicians Charlie Smith described in his final > chapters about what he'd heard in the Mardi Gras bars and dance halls. One of the musicians recorded was Bunk Johnson, who had been contacted by the authors in search of details about Bolden. Johnson, who had stopped playing years earlier and was living in poverty, had a career revival as a result.

Altadonna first started her career path as the lead singer and guitarist in her band, New Blind Nationals. Altadonna shifted her career focus towards filmmaking and went on to produce three feature films.  Early Life and education  Ashley Altadonna was born and raised in Houston, Texas, in 1979. In 2000 she moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she currently lives. She studied at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and graduated with Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2004. Altadonna has been a proactive activist for the transgender community.  Career  Prior to Altadonna's film making career she was a singer and guitarist for a band called New Blind Nationals. During this period, Altadonna had not started her transition. In 2004, the band split up and Altadonna switched her focus towards film making. In 2014, after Altadonna's transition a new band had been formed, The Glacial Speed. She spent most of her time on her musicianship and work as a filmmaker. Much of her music covers her transition as well as personal growth. One of Ashley Altadonna's goals in film making relates to trans activism. Specifically, she would like to educate individuals on the various challenges trans people face around the world. Altadonna had her own film production company formed in 2008 called Tall Lady Pictures, LLC. Altadonna has produced the following three short films: Making the Cut (2012), Whatever Suits You (2006), and Playing with Gender (2007). Many of Altadonna's films have been screened at festivals in New York City, Seattle, and San Francisco, as well as in London, Berlin, and Melbourne. Altadonna began working on her first film, the documentary Making the Cut, in 2008. The film synopsis surrounds Altadonna's goal to raise enough money for her gender reassignment surgery. The film explores and compares Altadonna's early life to her current life. Throughout the film she highlights the financial and social issues transgender individuals face and challenges social norms and ideologies on transgender people. In the film, Altadonna displays the many interviews she undergoes, and the many different fundraising activities she has been involved in during her activism for transgender rights. The reasons for these efforts, is for Altadonna to successfully raise $20,000 for her gender reassignment surgery as well as to fund this film, Making the Cut. The main crowdfunding site that Ashley Altadonna used for her first film was Kickstarter, through which she had raised $6000 for her project by November 2012. With this choice of crowdfunding, much of the participation comes from the demands of the audience rather than Altadonna, since the money is coming from fundraising. This film's campaign is what created some of Altadonna acknowledgement to the public. This led to Altadonna becoming such an activist for transgender individuals. Altadonna has been a contributor to many online magazines, and has been featured in Trans/Love: Radical Sex, Love & Relationships Beyond the Gender Binary. Most of her contributions cover her transgender identity experience.

The LKS was smaller and cheaper than its American counterpart, but was ultimately discarded in favor of the larger Buran. Claiming that the Buran project was too big, heavy, and expensive for Russia to complete, Chelomey designed the LKS in 1979. He ordered the construction of a full-scale mock-up, as a way to further stimulate interest. The project was never fully sanctioned however, and in 1982, Chelomey was officially ordered by the Soviet government to stop any further development. In March 1983, Chelomey made yet another attempt to obtain permission to build the LKS to repel US Intercontinental ballistic missiles. This too proved futile. In 1991 the mock-up was destroyed, possibly by sabotage.  History  From 1950 to 1964, before the US Space Shuttle in 1972, Chelomey developed two concepts for a spacecraft that would launch vertically and land horizontally. The MP-1 Kosmoplan was planned to complete missions to the Moon, Mars, and Venus. Upon re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, it would land with the support of the turbocharged engines similar to a conventional airplane. The other concept, called Raketoplan or \\"rocket plane\\", was a space shuttle intended to orbit the Earth and transport passengers, space freight, and weapons. Both concepts were never implemented due to the dis-empowerment of Nikita Khrushchev. In 1976, the Soviet government formally authorized the ‚Äúhead-designer‚Äù Valentin Glushko to proceed with the Buran project, which was intended to simply copy the Space Shuttle. The Buran project and its massive launch vehicle Energia were the targets of several critics among Russian space designers and scientists. One of them was Vladimir Chelomey, Glushko's former ally, who was responsible for the famous OKB-52 NPO Mashinostroyeniya (from which came the Proton rocket, the TKS spacecraft, and the Almaz and Salyut space stations). In 1979, Chelomey affirmed that the Buran project was too big, heavy, and expensive for Russia to complete, and designed the LKS, another space shuttle concept, as an alternative to the Buran or Energia. The first concept had two V-type vertical stabilizers, similar to the F/A-18 vertical stabilizer arrangement. This was later changed to the conventional arrangement of a rudder, similar to the Space Shuttle and Buran. In 1980, within a month of work, Chelomey ordered the construction of a full-scale mock-up by his team, as a way to further stimulate Soviet authorities in his direction. In 1982, Chelomey was officially ordered by the Soviet government to stop any further development of the LKS project. By this point, he was believed to have expended more than 400,000 rubles in a program not formally authorized by the Soviets. When US President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in March 1983, Chelomey made yet another attempt to obtain permission to build the LKS to repel US Intercontinental ballistic missiles. However, in September 1983, he was rejected by a government commission. Chelomey died in December 1984, leaving behind his most ambitious project.LKS russianspaceweb.com In 1991 the mock-up was destroyed in a so-called ‚Äúact of sabotage‚Äù by unknown people for unknown reasons.

The central four nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin macrocycle form a unique molecular pocket which is known to accommodate transition metals of various sizes and oxidation states. Due to the diversity of binding modes available to porphyrin, there is a growing interest in introducing other elements (i.e. main group elements) into this pocket. Boron in particular has been shown to prefer binding to porphyrin in a 2:1 stoichiometry, primarily due to its small atomic radius, but the Group XIII element will bind in a 1:1 ratio with corrole, a macromolecule with a structure similar to porphyrin but with a smaller N4 pocket. Boron porphyrins are of interest because of the unique geometric environment to which both boron and porphyrin are subjected upon B-N(pyrrole) bond formation. These new geometric motifs lead to novel reactivity, one of the most surprising examples being sterically-induced reductive coupling. Possible applications for boron porphyrins include BNCT delivery agents and OLED devices. Also of interest are molecules containing both boron and porphyrin moieties, but without B-N(pyrrole) bonds. Examples include diketonate-porphyrin compounds and dyads (two-component molecules) containing the classic BODIPY dye.  Synthesis  Boron porphyrin compounds can be synthesized either from the free base porphyrin or from a lithium porphyrin starting material. Two representative examples are shown here. The first is the porphyrin free base reacted with BX3 in the presence of water. The second is Li2(ttp) reacted with BX3. The (BX2)2(por) can undergo reduction to form a B-B bond and eliminate X2, giving (BX)2(por). From here, the halides can be replaced with BuLi to give (B-Bu)2(por), reacted with alcohols to give (B-OR)2(por), or even undergo halogen abstraction via weakly-coordinating anions to give [(B-B)(por)]2+.centerframe  Geometry  343x343pxOne of the major differences between p-block-element-centered porphyrins and transition- metal-centered porphyrins is the far smaller size of the interstitial atom, especially in the case of the first-row p-block. Other than protons, the next smallest atom known to bind to the central N4 pocket is lithium. The first two isolated lithium porphyrin complexes each reported a 2:1 metal to base ratio, and XRD suggested both lithium atoms reside out of the porphyrin plane. center Boron has a covalent radius of 85 pm, significantly smaller than lithium's 133 pm. This suggests the porphyrin pocket is more likely to accommodate two boron atoms rather than one. Indeed, each boron porphyrin synthesized thus far has adopted a ratio of 2:1, with a range of orientations relative to the N4 plane. The boron atoms can exist in the same plane as the porphyrin (both with and without additional out-of-plane B-X bonds), or out of N4 plane in either a cisoid or transoid geometry. This coordination motif is interesting because it introduces both boron and porphyrin to geometries they do not regularly adopt. Porphyrin readily binds to transition metals, which are capable of octahedral or square planar geometries. Boron, without available d-orbitals, typically adopts a trigonal planar or tetrahedral local bonding environment. Diboryl porphyrins, on the other hand, find boron in a pseudo-tetrahedral local environment and introduce a tetragonal distortion to the porphyrin, as can be seen in the DFT image above.423x423pxCorroles are distinct from porphyrins in that they contain one less methine to bridge between pyrrole units, creating a lower-symmetry compound and a smaller N4 pocket. For boron chemistry, this slightly smaller core allows for the possibility of binding to a single boron, whereas the porphyrin pocket has thus far always bound two. For such monoboryl corroles, DFT studies have suggested the boron preferentially binds to the dipyrromethene (A) site shown here, in which stability is attained by maximizing both BX‚ÄîHN hydrogen bonding and BH‚ÄîHN dihydrogen bonding, in addition to minimizing steric crowding. The Brothers group has shown the stereochemical implications of comparing diboryl porphyrin with diboryl corrole: porphyrin prefers transoid orientation of the diboryl unit, whereas corrole prefers the cisoid orientation.center  Non-central boron-porphyrin interactions  Two examples of boron-containing compounds that have been linked to porphyrin are BODIPY and diketonate.316x316pxnoneThe BODIPY chromophore acts as an antenna: it absorbs a broad range of UV-visible light, then emits at a wavelength compatible with porphyrin absorption, allowing for efficient energy transfer. This work has been extended to triads and to porphyrins with various core transition metals, some displaying multiphoton excitation. On the other hand, when boron difluoride Œ≤-diketonate is used for an antenna, the emission-absorption overlap is small and little change in the porphyrin's optical properties is observed. Though this chromophore is preferable to BODIPY in certain applications, it is not an effective antenna for porphyrin.  Reactivity  = Reduction = One consequence of geometric strain on both the boron and the porphyrin moieties is unique reactivity. The Brothers group was able to demonstrate reductive coupling, wherein two BX2 units inside the porphyrin pocket become X-B-B-X, only occurs with X=Br and when the substrates are within the porphyrin pocket. DFT calculations show that for X=Cl or F, the reaction is endothermic and non-spontaneous. However, for X=Br, the reduction is spontaneous, which was consistent with experimental findings. Further, when the same reaction is simulated with two porphyrin halves ((dipyrromethene)BX2), it is non-spontaneous even for X=Br, suggesting the steric strain of the porphyrin ring to be the driving force behind the reduction reaction. = Hydrolysis = 427x427px Hydrolysis is one of the primary reactions to occur in diboryl porphyrin complexes. In this reaction, RBOBR(por) reacts with water to exchange a B-OH bond for a B-R bond, liberating the R group. Hydrolysis products are important intermediates in the synthesis of the B-O-B(por) compounds from BX2(por) compounds. In fact, simply performing column chromatography on (BF2)2(por) on silica gives the partial hydrolysis product B2OF2(por). DFT computations show that hydrolysis, as in the scheme shown here, is energetically favorable (breaking of a relatively weak B-C bond, formation of a strong B-O bond, formation of benzene). However, only one of the two phenyl groups is observed to undergo hydrolysis. This suggests thermodynamic favorability is not the only factor at play. Rather, as Belcher et al. suggest, there is a significant steric component to this reaction. The boron in the porphyrin ring plane undergoes substitution, while the out-of-plane boron retains its phenyl bond. none417x417px = Halogen Abstraction = (Also see Geometry section above for a discussion of the B-B bonding environment.) Abstraction of halogens with two equivalents of sodium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate gives the dication with both boron atoms within the porphyrin plane. Two reversible reduction waves occur at reduction potentials lower than that of the free base.

NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx. * On January 4, 2009, a 6.625-inch storage well line operated by Columbia Gas Transmission Company in Elk View (near Charleston), Kanawha County, West Virginia, ruptured due to internal corrosion pitting, complicated by low impact toughness of the pipe material, causing $29,011 in damage. * On January 15, an accidental massive gas release at Pump Station 1 of the trans-Alaskan pipeline by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company threatened the site at the time. The company that runs the pipeline acknowledges a fire or explosion, had the gas ignited, could have imperiled the station's 60-plus workers and caused \\"an extended shutdown\\" of oil fields. There was no ignition or explosion. The incident occurred as BP workers used a cleaning device called a pig to swab oil out of an old pipeline the company was preparing to decommission. The 34-inch pipe was among major Prudhoe trunk lines found in 2006 to be ravaged with corrosion, due to BP's admitted lack of proper maintenance. A large volume of gas then bypassed the pig somehow, and rushed to Pump Station 1, a key asset through which every drop of oil coming off the North Slope must pass. * On February 11, a gas pipeline exploded and burned near a natural gas treatment plant, near Carthage, Texas. There were no injuries. * At approximately 5 p.m. on February 18, a rupture of pipeline near the pump station and terminal located in Cygnet, Ohio, owned by Philadelphia-based Sunoco, resulted in one of the largest oil spills in Wood County history. Upon learning of the release, the company immediately shut down the pipeline, stopped operations at the pump station and terminal, notified the appropriate authorities, and began an emergency response. As of 11:05 a.m. ET on February 19, the release had been stopped from the pipe. The damaged pipeline, which was operating at the time, released crude oil into a farm field. Eventually, about 19,000 gallons of the 52,500 gallons released were recovered. Some of the crude oil did contaminate a local creek. There were no fatalities, or injuries. * On February 19, leaking gas was detected near homes, in Somerset, Massachusetts. Evacuations followed, but one resident who did not respond to knocking on doors was killed, when the gas exploded. Prior excavation damage to a gas main was the cause. * On May 4, Kinder Morgan's Florida Gas Transmission pipeline burst near Palm City and Hobe City, Florida (near Port Salerno, Florida). The explosion ejected 106 feet of buried pipe weighing about 5,000 pounds out of the ground and onto the right-of-way between Interstate 95 and the Florida Turnpike (SR-91). The rupture was near a high school that was within the 366-foot potential impact radius. Two people were injured when their car ran off the road, and a Sheriff's deputy walked through a dense cloud and inhaled natural gas. The escaping gas did not ignite. The pipe was manufactured in 1959. The leak caused $596,218 in property damage. FGT was cited for safety violations: failing to identify a high-consequence area, failing to test operators for alcohol and drugs, and failing to have prompt emergency response; PHMSA assessed a $95,000 fine. * On May 5, a natural gas pipeline exploded and caught on fire, near Rockville, Indiana in Parke County, about north of Terre Haute, Indiana. The cause of this failure was determined to be external corrosion. Additional work performed as a result of this order provided significant indications of external corrosion in various sections of this line. Pictures have been released around the area showing the damage caused. 52 people were evacuated in a one-mile (1.6 km) area of the explosion. No injuries reported. * On May 21, an Enbridge pipeline pig sending trap in Superior, Wisconsin leaked from operator error, spilling about 6500 gallons of crude oil. 700 cubic yards of contaminated soil had to be removed. * On July 15, an explosion occurred at Kinder Morgan's Midcontinent Express pipeline natural gas metering station that was under construction, while it was being pressure tested with nitrogen, in Smith County, Mississippi. One worker was killed, and two others injured. There was no fire. The workers were \\"literally right on top\\" of the explosion; their injuries were caused by pressure, not heat. One worker was injured when part of the pipe fell on him. The explosion snapped and bent a pipeline connected to a massive separator unit which was slung several yards. * On August 10, operators of a Belle Fourche pipeline incorrectly operated the line, causing it to fail, near Edgerton, Wyoming. About 30,000 gallons of crude oil were spill, with about 1,200 gallons being lost. * On August 17, a pipeline was found leaking by an aerial patrol in Atoka County, Oklahoma. of diesel fuel were estimated to have been released as a result of this accident, and none of it was recovered. * On October 7, a leaking pipeline carrying jet fuel was accidentally ignited by a pipeline repair crew in Upton County, Texas. * On October 28, Kinder Morgan's Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America above- ground storage tank north of St. Elmo, Illinois caught fire, injuring two workers. Welding caused the tank to ignite resulting in several explosions. Two workers were taken to the hospital. * On November 5, two people were hurt when an El Paso Natural Gas pipeline exploded in the Texas Panhandle near Bushland, Texas. The explosion left a hole about 30 yards by 20 yards and close to deep. The orange inferno rose about 700 feet in the air; the blast incinerated the home of the Jose Torres family, injuring his wife Agnieszka and daughter Franczeska. About 200 residents in the area were evacuated. Bushland is in Potter County, about west of Amarillo. The failure was in an abandoned tap, but the exact failure reason remains unknown. The explosion cause $436,136 in property damage. * On November 14, a fire at a gas compressor station near Cameron, West Virginia slightly burned one employee, and caused $5.6 million of damage to the facility. * Also on November 14, 2009, a newly built 42-inch gas transmission pipeline near Philo, Ohio failed on the second day of operation. There was no fire, but evacuations resulted. Several indications of pipe deformation were found. * From December 3 to 4, a Minnesota Pipeline carrying crude oil leaked in Todd County, Minnesota, spilling about 5,000 barrels of crude. Pipeline workers on December 3 had been repairing sections of the 16-inch pipe in a rural area, left on the afternoon of December 3, and the spill occurred during the evening hours of December 3‚Äì4. * On December 23, a crude oil pipeline started leaking in Galveston, Texas. There was no fire or explosion as a result of the accident, and an estimated of crude oil were released to the environment.

This power resides in the respective legislatures, with tariffs, being a tax law, is required to originate in the lower house of the legislature. Tariffs have always been a contentious issue in Australian politics. At times they have been the focus of an intense debate. This was particularly true in the debate in the colonies leading up to the Australian federation and the ensuing debate in the federal Parliament when it was necessary to establish a uniform Australia-wide schedule of tariff rates. It was true also in the period of the 1970s and 1980s when reforms began the process of lowering tariff levels. The outcomes of these debates have had an effect on the growth of the Australian economy and the distribution of real household income. Pre-federation The first tariffs were introduced in the Colony of New South Wales by Governor King in 1800. They were imposed on imports of alcoholic beverages: spirits, beer and wine. Tariffs were imposed on tobacco, cigars and cigarettes in NSW in 1818. At that time New South Wales included the territories of the modern states of Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania. When established later, other colonies also imposed tariffs on imported goods, either wholly or largely, on these two groups of goods. These duties were revenue duties. In the 19th century, taxation of these two groups of goods yielded large revenues for the colonies. In fact, revenue from these two groups, which were known as \\"narcotics and stimulants\\", accounted for most of the tariff revenue in Australia for almost all of the century; in 1900 they still accounted for 48% of total tariff revenues from the colonies. In all colonies, the range of goods subject to tariff duties steadily expanded during the century. The passage of the Australian Colonies Government Act by the Imperial Parliament in 1850 introduced responsible government in the colonies, allowing each colony to determine its own tariff policies. Increasingly, some of the new tariffs were introduced from a protective motive. In 1866, Victoria added a wide range of goods to the list of dutiable items, most of them manufactured items, all subject to an ad valorem rate of duty of 10%. Economic historians generally agree that these tariffs were intended to provide employment for miners who had become surplus after the end of the Victorian gold rush. All colonies, except New South Wales, followed Victoria in adopting tariffs for protective purposes rather than to raise revenue. As the range of goods subject to import taxation broadened, the average levels of duty, in ad valorem terms, showed increasing divergence among the colonies. New South Wales continued an explicit policy of limiting import duties to a small range of goods for revenue purposes (with the notable exception of sugar which was heavily protected). In the debates about forming a federation, New South Wales was known as the \\"free trade\\" colony and Victoria, the second of the \\"large\\" colonies, as \\"protectionist\\". By the end of the century, Queensland and Western Australia had average rates which were more than double that of Victoria but revenue motives predominated in these colonies.Lloyd, 2017 In the colonial era goods imported into one colony from another colony were also subject to duty at rates fixed by the importing colony. In general, goods imported from other colonies, mainly agricultural products, coal and machinery, were subject to lower rates than goods imported from other countries. However, they were still significant. The average ad valorem rates on imports from other colonies in 1900 ranged from 3.7% for imports into New South Wales to 19.3% for inter-colonial imports into Tasmania. Inter-colonial imports were a deterrent to inter-colony trade and, more importantly in the debate before federation, a major irritant in inter-colony relations. From the point of view of the form and structure of tariffs, the colonial systems had developed features which carried over to the first Australian customs tariff. This applied to the mix of specific and ad valorem rates, the more favorable tax treatment of intermediate inputs, the complex differentiation of tariff rates within product groups or industries, and to differential rates on imports of excisable items and the excise tax rates on similar domestic products, which gave a protective margin to imports of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. After federation  =Establishing uniform tariffs= In framing the Australian Constitution two requirements relating to imposition of tariffs were set out. Firstly, all tariffs are required to be uniform throughout AustraliaSection 88 of the Constitution of Australia and secondly that there not be tariffs on interstate trade and commerce (ie., that all inter-state trade to be \\"absolutely free\\").Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia To break the deadlock in the pre-federation debate as to the level of tariffs on imports from other countries, it was resolved that these would be determined by the federal government within two years of federation. In the first and second Commonwealth parliaments, from 1901 to 1906, there were three political parties ‚Äî the Free Trade Party, the Protectionist Party and the Labour Party ‚Äî with the level of tariffs being a major issue between them. New South Wales had been in favour of a free trade approach while Victoria was protectionist. Parliament passed the first Customs Tariff Act in 1902, which was a compromise position.Lloyd, P. J. (2015) \\"Customs Union and Fiscal Union in Australia at Federation.\\" Economic Record, 91: 155‚Äì157. Estimates suggest that the 1902 rates increased the average rate of customs duties from other countries from 13.1% in the colonies to 17.5% under the new Commonwealth rates. The Protectionist Party, which was the largest party in the federal parliament and formed the government with Labour support, was still dissatisfied with the level of tariffs, and established a Royal Commission on Customs and Excise Tariffs in 1904.List of Australian royal commissions The Commission reported in 1907 and recommended a further increase in customs rates. The average rate of duty in 1907 was 26.2%. Deakin‚Äòs Protectionist Party introduced into Parliament in December 1907 an explanatory memorandum setting out a new protection policy. This was a declaration of intention to raise the levels of protection from imports in Australia and also, importantly, to ensure that this protection was passed on to workers in the import-competing manufacturing industries. The party combined with the Labour Party, now firmly committed to higher tariffs, to pass the Customs Tariff Act of 1908, which was called the Lyne Tariff, following the practice of naming a new act after the Minister who introduced it to Parliament. This act, more than the Customs Tariff Act of 1902, propelled Australia into high levels of protection for manufactured goods. It increased tariff rates on many items, particularly on woolen goods, iron and steel products together with agricultural machinery. The 1908 Act represented a triumph in Parliament of the protectionists over the free traders. The average rate of duty increased in 1908 to 30.6%. The Free Trade Party was dissolved in 1909, and in 1910 the two non-Labour parties, Deakin's Protectionist group and the remnants of the Free Trade Party, combined to form the Liberal Party. In the same year the first majority Labour Government was formed, and both parliamentary parties proclaimed their support for protectionism and higher tariffs. =From steadily rising tariffs to reform= Tariff rates on some items were increased during World War I and piecemeal in the Tariff Acts every few years after the war. The tariff of 1922, known as the Greene Tariff, increased many rates, particularly on industries that had grown during the war. The tariffs of 1926 and 1928, known as the Pratten Tariffs, further increased many rates. During the Great Depression, the Scullin Labor government raised many rates. The period leading up to and including the Great Depression was a particularly important period in the history of tariffs in Australia. It established high barriers for imports of manufactures overall. For instance, in 1931/1932, the average duty on all imports was 37% and on dutiable imports only it was 72%. Since then there has been an unwinding of the very high rates of the Great Depression era. Tariffs stayed at very high levels, with the average rate on dutiable imports only remaining over 40% until after World War II. Changes in tariff rates and the method of valuation for duty purposes in 1947 reduced the average level of tariffs to 30%. In the 1970s piecemeal reform began to lower tariff rates in some industries. In 1973 all tariffs (except those on excisable items) were lowered by 25% by the Whitlam Labor government. This was the first across-the- board tariff cut ever in Australia, although the policy motive was to reduce the rate of inflation, not to improve the efficiency of production. However, the cuts to major industries were undone within two years as the government restored their rates to the pre-1973 levels. A new strategy of gradual phased reductions in tariff rates was introduced by the Hawke Labor Government in the 1988 Economic Statement to the House of Representatives. Initially the tariff cuts were to be phased in over a four-year period but a \\"second phase\\" announced in 1991 extended these annual cuts until 2000. This plan effected a much greater reduction in tariff rates than all previous piecemeal reforms. Phased reductions have the advantage that they apply to a very large number of tariff items and they occur annually, thus maintaining the momentum of reform and the predictability of tariff rates. They were supplemented by major reductions in the tariffs protecting passenger motor vehicles and the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries, the two industries retaining the highest levels of protection, which had been excluded from the phased reductions because they were subject to special industry plans. Post 2000 the main reductions were again in the motor vehicle and TCF industries. The tariff rate on new completely-built-up passenger motor vehicles indicates tariff reforms of the last thirty years. This tariff item has been the single most important item in the Australian Customs Tariff since General Motors Holden began assembly of motor vehicles in 1948. In the late 1980s the MFN tariff rate on this item had been 45% and by 2000 it had been reduced to 15%. Then it was reduced to in 10% in 2005 and to 5% in 2010. This is the current rate (apart from the tax on luxury cars). As the level of protection was reduced the number of companies assembling vehicles steadily declined. At the peak of the industry there were more than 10 companies assembling motor vehicles in Australia. From 2016 there were only three ‚Äì Ford, Toyota and Holden. All three ceased production by the end of 2017. From the outset this industry had never been competitive at world prices and its existence depended upon high levels of protection. Australia now imports virtually all its vehicles, many from countries that protect their local vehicle markets ‚Äì like Thailand ‚Äì with import duties of up to 80% on imported motor vehicles.Severe over-capacity in the global vehicle market ‚Äì probably exacerbated by high levels of protection and government subsidies in exporting countries ‚Äì has led to vigorous price competition in Australia's imported vehicle market, benefitting Australian consumers. =Role of statutory authorities= A unique and important feature of tariff history in Australia is the role played by independent statutory authorities which were set up to advise the governments of the day on tariff policy, and later more broadly on all measures of industry assistance. The first of these was the Tariff Board which was set up in 1921. It was succeeded by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), which began operation in 1974. The IAC was replaced by the Industries Commission (IC) in 1990. It in turn was replaced by the Productivity Commission (PC) in 1996. This step greatly extended the range of policy matters that could be referred to the Commission so that it now covered a broad range of micro-economic policies and social issues. Since 1921 all changes to substantive tariff rate on individual items or product groups have been subject to review and recommendation by an independent advisory commission or panel. This review has been conducted as a public enquiry. Because of the high frequency of tariff changes in Australia, this has meant that the statutory authorities have conducted multiple enquiries into some product groups. In the case of the motor vehicle industry, as an example, there have been 24 reports into the industry since 1948, though in the earlier days of the Tariff Board some of these reports related to components such as engines or bodies. This amounts to one report every three years on average into the industry. For the Textile, Clothing Footwear group of products, the number of reports is much greater. Two sets of changes in tariff rates are exempt from this advisory process. The first is multilateral tariff changes (and other policies relating to our commitments as a member of the GATT and later the WTO) and the second is bilateral or regional trade agreements. The exclusion of these two areas has been a major limitation on advice from the independent commissions on tariff policies. These commissions have affected Australian tariff history in several ways. They have given advice which has affected the parliamentary decisions on individual tariff groups under reference. Their advice has not always been accepted. Yet, the views concerning overall protection policy of the Tariff Board and its successors gradually laid the ground for acceptance among the politicians of the need for tariff reform. Post-World War II they developed criteria of what production is efficient to guide their recommendations. In the pre-World War II days, the Board confined its advice solely to the specific issues of the goods under reference, following principles laid down by the Board in 1933. It was criticized by the Brigden Committee Report for its lack of an overall view of tariff policy, including its failure to develop a maximum rate of protection. From the 1960s onwards the Tariff Board became increasingly critical of the high and widely varying levels of protection of manufacturing industries. In May 1971 the Board began a Tariff Review which was to examine levels of protection in manufacturing industries. It proposed to confine rates to within a range with an upper and lower point of reference, the points being defined in terms of effective rates of protection rather than nominal rates. This precipitated an intense tussle between the reformist views of the Tariff Board, led by Alf Rattigan, on the one hand and the Whitlam (Labor) and Fraser (Liberal/Country Party) governments on the other. The Tariff Board and its successor authorities played a major role in developing measures of the level of protection for individual industries and in analyzing the effects of the differentiated structure of protection. The Tariff Board began calculating effective rates of industries in the manufacturing sector in its Annual Report for 1968/1969, soon after the concept was invented. Alf Rattigan, the first chairman of the Industries Assistance Commission, also enthusiastically supported the development of computable general equilibrium modelling (CGE) in Australia to analyze the effects of tariffs. CGE has been applied to the analysis of proposals for regional trading agreements and for multilateral reductions in tariff levels. The results of these studies have supported those who have advocated trade policy reforms as they invariably show gains from trade liberalization, though the gains are often small relative to existing GDP. Impact of tariffs =Households= The effects of tariffs on the real incomes of households in the economy are complex and vary from one tariff decision to another but some general effects are observable. Since most intermediate inputs have entered duty-free throughout the Commonwealth period, the direct price effects of tariffs are borne mostly by consumers of the products. A report by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1980 showed that, at that time, the consumer tax effect of tariffs is regressive, falling more heavily on lower income groups. The indirect general equilibrium effects on the distribution of the incomes of factors are unclear and depend on the models used. The Brigden Committee in 1929 predicted that tariffs would induce an overall income redistribution in favor of labor but the later CGE studies do not find this to be true. In the ORANI model, Dixon et al. in 1977, showed that increased assistance to industries threatened by import competition would benefit skilled blue collar workers more than semi-skilled and unskilled blue collar workers. Theoretical models with capital specific to an industry show that it gains from assistance to its industry. This is likely to be the case too in Australia for those workers whose skills are specific to an industry or product group, though this specificity has not been modeled. =Different economic sectors= The pattern of tariffs and industry protection in Australia has favored manufacturers over the other two sectors producing tradeable goods: agriculture and mining. This pattern was established in the last quarter of the 19th century and it has persisted since then. The Brigden Committee Report regarded tariffs as a tax on exporters whose prices are fixed on world markets. \\"We may say, therefore, that the cost of tariff protection, falling ultimately on the export primary industries, falls chiefly on the owners of land, as such.\\" From around the time of the Brigden Committee Report, the farm lobby has sought to offset the bias by increasing assistance to farmers, a policy that was known in the 1920s and 1930s as \\"protection all round\\" or, in the 1970s, as \\"tariff compensation\\". This strategy did not eliminate the bias. Lloyd and MacLaren in 2014 quantify this bias by calculating a series of the \\"Relative Rate of Assistance\\" in the agricultural sector relative to those in the manufacturing sector for the period 1903/1904 to 2010/2011. The bias holds for every year of the century and it is most strong for the major agricultural exporters ‚Äì wool, beef, mutton and lamb, and wheat and oats. It fell steadily after World War II because the average level of assistance to manufacturers fell more sharply than did the average level of assistance to farmers. Preferential rates and short-term variations Tariff rates normally apply to all imports of an item and are fixed for the future indefinitely unless subject to later legislative change. There are two exceptions to this rule; namely, preferential rates and short-term variations due to contingent protection. The former are adjustments downwards and the latter are adjustments upwards. =Preferential tariff rates= The most important group of preferences introduced in Australia are preferential rates derived from the formation of reciprocal regional trade agreements. The second group is non-reciprocal preferences granted to specified developing country trading partners. =Regional preferences= The first preferences introduced into the Australian Customs Tariff were those granted to specified imports from the United Kingdom in 1907. These were extended in the scheme of Imperial Preferences devised at the 1932 Ottawa Agreement. This was a scheme for reciprocal preferences among the UK and many countries of the then British Empire. Imperial preferences were an important feature of the Australian tariff regime in the 1930s and early post-World War II period. The margin of preference on some items were more than 50% and the average margins were 10 to 20%. They were reduced from the mid-1950s and finally eliminated in 1980, after the UK accession to the European Economic Community. Subsequently, Australia has formed regional trading agreements which are in force with New Zealand first and now ten other countries or groups of countries and more agreements have been signed but are not yet in force and still more are under negotiation. A feature of these agreements is that Australia has reduced the preferential rate to zero for all tariff items in the agreements (when fully implemented according to the schedule); this holds notably for the agreements with USA, China, ASEAN and New Zealand. It is one of only a handful of countries in the WTO that has done so. These preferences have contributed significantly to the lowering of average tariff rates since 1983 though this effect has been limited by some restrictive rules of origin. Moreover, the agreements have contributed to a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy. Some commentators have been concerned about the costs of trade diversion. But the margins of preference are much less than those granted to the UK in the heyday of Imperial preferences because the MFN (non- preferential) rates have been steadily reduced and we have signed with countries supplying most of our imports and most notably with China. Consequently, trade diversion is small. =Preferences to imports from developing countries= Australia was the first developed country to grant tariff preferences to designated developing countries under Part IV of the GATT. It did so in the 1966 Australian System of Tariff Preferences. Subsequently, further preferences to Developing Countries have been granted to Papua New Guinea and other Pacific countries but the scope of these preferences is much less than those under reciprocal trade agreements. =Contingent protection= Australia passed legislation allowing for the application of antidumping duties in the Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906. It was one of the first countries to do so and since then the scope of provisions permitting contingent protection have been widened from time to time. Provision was made for the application of countervailing duties in 1961 and, after the removal of comprehensive import licensing as a protective measure in Australia, provision was made for the application of temporary duties in 1960. Temporary duties have been permitted under GATT/WTO rules as a safeguard measure. Throughout the whole of period of the GATT/WTO world trade rules, Australia has been one of the most frequent users of contingent protection. Duty collected from contingent protection duties is recorded in statistics of total duty collected and therefore enters into the calculation of average tariff rates. As a component of total duty collected these duties are quite small. However, they have been applied most of the time to industries which already have above-average levels of (nominal and effective) protection, and the implicit ad valorem rates of contingent duty are generally high. For example, in the recent period 2014/2015, 60% of dumping and countervailing measures were imposed on steel products and the average dumping duty over the period 2009 to 2015 was 17%. As a second example, the Industries Assistance Commission estimated that these temporary quotas on TCF products were equivalent to an ad valorem tax of 40%. All three forms of contingent protection have played a part disproportionate to the importance of the duty collected. As top-up measures available virtually on demand, they have helped to maintain heavily protected producers whose existence was vulnerable to import competition. Trends center center center center Non-tariff assistance Although tariffs have been the dominant form of industry assistance for most of the past two hundred years, non-tariff forms of assistance ‚Äì such as import quotas, content plans and subsidies ‚Äì have benefitted particular industries or product groups. There have been two periods when non-tariff measures have dominated tariff assistance. The first was the period from 1939 to 1960 when comprehensive import licensing was the principal form of assistance. The second is the period beginning in the late 1990s when monetary forms of assistance through the Commonwealth budgeting process have become more important. In its annual Trade and Assistance Review, the Productivity Commission divides industry assistance into three categories ‚Äì net tariff assistance (tariff output assistance less tariff input penalty), budgetary outlays and tax concessions. It calculates these statistics for the four sectors of the economy ‚Äì Primary Production, Mining, Manufacturing and Services ‚Äì and for individual industries within these sectors. The growth of assistance through the budget is a major change in the traditional pattern of assistance. Further, a new pattern of assistance is emerging within budget assistance, with a much higher proportion of budget assistance going to R& D, clean energy, export development and to small businesses. Most of this is not industry-specific and does not result from the traditional industry or product-specific arguments advanced to justify tariffs. Manufacturing is still more reliant than the other sectors on tariff assistance ‚Äì in 2016/2017, it got 72% of its Net Combined Assistance through the tariff regime and 28% from the budget. By comparison, however, budgetary assistance provided less than 5% of total net assistance to this sector in the early 1980s. The shift has been due partly to falling tariffs but mostly to rapidly rising budget assistance As a consequence, in the last two decades the Australian success in reforming its tariff regime has been halted by the growth of industry assistance through the budget.

Ball, the chief designer of C&C; Design, and first built in 1979. The Landfall series was part of a trend within C&C; Yachts to develop more cruising-oriented designs under company president George Cuthbertson's direction during the later 1970s and early 1980s. Production The design was built by the Canadian company, C&C; Yachts, at their Rhode Island, United States plant, between 1979 and 1984, but it is now out of production. The boat was produced for yacht charter market, but was also marketed as a couple's cruising sailboat. Design The Landfall 35 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with extensive use of balsawood cores. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised, near-vertical transom, a skeg-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional deep-draft keel. The cabin top fits two teak dorade boxes for ventilation. Features include self tailing winches and a mainsheet traveller. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar 3HM diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The design has a hull speed of . =Accommodations= The boat was built with two interior arrangements, one with a conventional \\"V\\" berth forward and the other with a V-shaped couch and dinette table that could be converted into a berth for sleeping. The galley has two stainless steel sinks, a gimbal-mounted three-burner alcohol stove and an oven and a large ice box. The head includes a shower. Operational history In a review, Accredited Marine Surveyor Kurtis Samples describes sailing the design: \\"It was a February day, the winds were 20-25 kts, with gusts to 30 kts, the temperature was 42¬∞ F and there were five foot swells with rolling white caps spaced at twenty foot intervals. A great day for sailing. We pointed her into the wind, engine steady at 1000 RPM and hoisted the main. Killed the engine, fell-off about 20 degrees to starboard and let the jenoa roll-on out. She took off quick and we could feel her accelerate ... Close hauled she will sail to within 50 degrees of true wind, but at 60 to 70 degrees is her best point of sail, she heeled gracefully, found her groove, maintained 7.02 kts and rode the waves with little to no pounding. With her high bow she'll split through and roil the waves aside with ease. When the gust came she dipped her teak toecap for few seconds, kissed 37-40 degrees of heel, shook-off the gust and then returned to the original 30 degrees. She did not want to round up, the weather helm was minimal and there were no surprises.\\" Samples concluded: \\"the C&C; Landfall 35 was a pleasure to sail. She was easy to handle; predictable and forgiving yet had that solid feel of an Island Packet or Valiant. One thing I did observe during the close haul, was a slight side ways slip, which is directly related to the shoal keel.\\" See also * List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *C&C; 34/36 *C&C; 35 *Cal 35 *Cal 35 Cruise *Express 35 *Freedom 35 *Goderich 35 *Hughes 36 *Hughes-Columbia 36 *Hunter 35 Legend *Hunter 35.5 Legend *Hunter 356 *Island Packet 35 *Mirage 35 *Niagara 35 *Pilot 35 *Southern Cross 35 References External links *Original C&C; factory brochure for the Landfall 35 with Sail Plan, Accommodations Layout, and Standard Equipment List Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Landfall 35"},{"id":"58535692","text":"Claire Alexandra Styron known as Alexandra Styron, is an American author and professor.

Description Colonies of this species form solid hemispherical or irregular mounds. The corallites (the stony cups in which the polyps sit) are small and rounded, each having six palliform lobes (stony blades) on their inner margins. The polyps are of a distinctive appearance being of regular length and topped with a uniform bundle of tentacles. The colour of this coral may be bluish, green or brown and the tentacles may be tipped with white. Distribution and habitat Goniopora tenuidens is native to the tropical Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Madagascar, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, through the western, central and eastern Indian Ocean to southeastern Asia, Indonesia, Japan and the South China Sea, northern and eastern Australia and island groups in the western Pacific Ocean. It is found subtidally in various reef habitats and in lagoons, at depths down to about . Ecology Goniopora tenuidens is one of several species of corals that are bioeroded by the sponge Cliona orientalis, which tunnels into its skeletal structure. Status This is a common species of coral with a wide range and a presumed large total population. It is more resistant than many corals to bleaching and coral diseases. The main threat faced by corals is destruction of their reef habitats, through climate change, with increased incidence of severe storms, and ocean acidification. Despite corals in the genus Goniopora often being collected for the aquarium trade, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being of \\"least concern\\".

It began in 1956 when Prince Hassan bin Talal, the Crown Prince of Jordan approached Ahmad Chalabi, an Iraqi economist while the latter was teaching at the American University of Beirut to launch a new Jordanian bank, and wanted Chalabi to help him form and run the venture. By 1958, Petra Bank was incorporated and running for business in Amman and throughout Jordan. The Crown Prince's support also enabled Petra to open a string of branches for the first time in the West Bank. Members of Chalabi's family also ran an investment company, Socofi, in Geneva, another bank, MEBCO, in Geneva and Beirut, as well as a Washington arm of Petra Bank known as Petra International. Petra Bank became the third largest bank in Jordan. But when the Central Bank of Jordan, through a decree issued by its governor Mohammed Said Nabulsi imposed tough liquidity ratios on Jordanian banks to reduce the outflow of foreign exchange from Jordan, forcing banks to deposit 30% of their foreign holdings as reserves at the Central Bank, Petra Bank became the only Jordanian bank that could not comply with the liquidity ratios imposed. An investigation was launched which led to accusations of embezzlement and false accounting by the bank. Many of the bank's bad loans were to Chalabi-linked companies. The Swiss and Lebanese firms, Mebco and Socofi, were subsequently put into liquidation too. Petra Bank collapsed on August 2, 1989 and was put under government supervision and an audit was imposed on the bank's books. Two weeks later, Ahmed Chalabi fled Jordan through the help of Prince Hassan bin Talal. The audit investigation subsequently uncovered further evidence of massive fraud committed by the bank. A $350 million bail-out was announced by the Central Bank of Jordan to pay out to depositors to avert a potential collapse of the country's entire banking system. According to an Arthur Anderson audit report, there was $80 million in bad loans at Petra Bank, $20 million lost to \\"unsupported foreign currency balances at counter-party banks\\" and another $60 million that could simply not be found. The affair cost Jordan around $200 million in losses. The Jordanian attorney-general charged that Ahmed Chalabi was directly responsible for the collapse of Petra Bank. Chalabi was convicted and sentenced in absentia for bank fraud by a Jordanian military tribunal to 22 years in prison on 31 charges of embezzlement, theft, misuse of depositor funds and currency speculation. Chalabi maintained that his prosecution was a politically motivated effort to discredit him. Chalabi never served the sentence dying on 3 November 2015 from a heart attack.

Life Born , he was the only known child of the Caesar Nikephoros Melissenos and his wife Eudokia Komnene, the older sister of the Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (). His life is relatively obscure. He married around 1090, but neither the name, nor the origin or any other details about his wife are known. When Nikephoros Melissenos died in 1104, John inherited his father's large estates around Thessalonica, but it is unknown whether he also inherited the governance over the city, as his father before him. Otherwise his life during the reign of Alexios I is unknown. When Alexios I died in 1118, he evidently supported the succession of his oldest son John II Komnenos () against the claims of his sister Anna Komnene. As a result, when John II was crowned emperor, John was promoted to parakoimomenos and appointed joint head of the administration along with his cousin the protovestiarios Gregory Taronites. However, according to Niketas Choniates, once in office, John \\"administered his office without restraint, behaving pompously and with singular presumptuousness\\", and was quickly dismissed. He is no longer mentioned in the sources thereafter. Offspring and descendants Information about his children survives only in much later sources: Gennadios Scholarios in the 15th century reports that he had two sons, Nikephoros and Alexios Komnenos Melissenos, while only the latter is mentioned by the 16th-century scholar Pseudo-Sphrantzes. According to Scholarios, Nikephoros was sent to suppress an anti-Byzantine revolt in Naples led by a certain Roger Nabardos, but failed and for fear of punishment stayed there. Scholarios maintains that he married Roger's sister and became the progenitor of two families, the Komnenatoi and Melissoi, but as Konstantinos Varzos points out, no information about these families survives. Alexios on the other hand may have served as megas doux of the Byzantine navy, and married a lady, who according to Pseudo-Sphrantzes was a member of the Strategopoulos family. Pseudo-Sphrantzes and Scholarios give different accounts on the number and names of Alexios' sons: according to the former, he had only one son, named Theodosios, the father of the Caesar Alexios Strategopoulos and of Michael Strategopoulos; the latter gives three sons, Theophylact, Michael, and Nicholas, of whom Theophylact was Theodosios' father and grandfather of the Caesar.

Rajaram served as Chair of the Governing Board of the Psychonomic Society (2008) and as President of the Association for Psychological Science (2017-2018). Along with Judith Kroll and Randi Martin, Rajaram co-founded the organization Women in Cognitive Science in 2001, with the aim of improving the visibility of contributions of women to cognitive science. In 2019, she received the Psychonomic Society Clifford T. Morgan Distinguished Leadership Award for sustained leadership and service to the discipline of cognitive psychology. Rajaram is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Psychonomic Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, the Eastern Psychological Association, and the Association for Psychological Science. She is also a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists, a prestigious honor society dedicated to psychology.  Biography  Suparna Rajaram was born in Bellary, India. She received a B.A. in Psychology, Economics, and English Literature (1984) and a M.A. in Psychology (1986) from Mt. Carmel College of Bangalore University. She moved to the United States to pursue a M.S. in Cognitive Psychology at Purdue University, and completed her degree in 1988 under the supervision of James H. Neely. Rajaram continued her education at Rice University, where she obtained her PhD in Cognitive Psychology in 1991 under the supervision of Henry L. Roediger, III. While at Rice, Rajaram collaborated with Roediger on research comparing assessments of implicit memory. From 1991-1993, Rajaram was a post-doctoral research fellow at Temple University School of Medicine, where she conducted research on amnesia with J. Branch Coslett. Rajaram joined the Faculty of Psychology at Stony Brook University in 1993 and was promoted to Full Professor in 2003. She served as the Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs in the College of Arts and Sciences at Stony Brook University (2012-2015). Rajaram received a FIRST Award from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). In addition to NIMH, her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the Russell Sage Foundation, and Google. Rajaram served as Associate Editor of Psychological Science (2007-2008), Psychological Bulletin (2003-2005), and Memory & Cognition (1998-2001).  Research  Rajaram's research program encompasses studies of human amnesia and intact memory to address the cognitive and neural bases of memory functions, such as the distinction between explicit memory and implicit memory. Her lab has examined differences in the effects of repeated testing and repeated studying on learning, and how repetition impacts learning of new information in amnesia. In one of her studies, her team examined how repetition of information confers advantages in knowing versus remembering information in individuals with amnesia. They found that repetition helped people with amnesia gain a sense of familiarity with material (i.e., knowing), whereas for individuals with normal memory, repetition enhanced both familiarity and recollection (i.e., knowing and remembering). Rajaram has conducted numerous studies focusing on how social factors influence learning and memory. Her lab aims to understand the social transmission of memory in groups of people and in social networks, the emergence of collective memory, and how collaborative learning may help or hinder memory. Her research indicates that collaboration with peers often weakens the memory performance of individuals; at the same time getting help from one's peers may help to eliminate memory errors. Rajaram's 2014 paper on social transmission of memory, co-authored with H.Y. Choi, H.M. Blumen, and A.R. Congleton, was named \\"Best Paper of the Year\\" by European Society of Cognitive Psychology. This study examined a phenomenon known as collaborative inhibition, wherein individuals contribute less to recalling information when they are part of a group than when they are recalling information on their own. This study explored how changing the membership of groups influenced individual and collective memory. Rajaram and her colleagues have also studied how emotion enhances memory. They found that emotional memories are not immune to error, yet emotional memories are less likely to be distorted by social influences than nonemotional memories.

Built about 1798, it is a well-preserved example of a late 18th- century farmhouse, a rare property type in the now largely industrial town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Ives-Baldwin House is in a rural-suburban area of northeastern Meriden, on the north side of Baldwin Avenue near its junction with Winding Brook Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around a center entrance. The entrance is simply framed, with a transom window above. A gabled ell extends to the rear. The interior retains many original features, including window framing, doors, and fireplaces. With The house was built about 1798 by Thomas Ives, a carpenter. Stylistically, it is an unusually late example of a traditional Georgian style (more typically built in the mid-18th century), and is distinctive for its well-preserved interior plan and features. Ives sold the house to Moses Baldwin in 1815, in whose family it remained for a century. Moses was a successful farmer and local mill owner, who also served as town selectman; his son Nathan continued his father's businesses. The property remained in use as farmland until roughly the end of World War II, after which the surrounding land was sold off in sections for suburban residential development.

Alden Weir 1905 painting \\"Upland Pasture\\" Upland pasture (rough grazing and/or semi-natural rough grazing) is a type of semi-natural grassland located in uplands of rolling foothills or upon higher slopes, greater than 350 meters (1148.29 feet) and less than 600 meters (1968.50 feet) from ground level, that is used primarily for grazing. Upland pastures occur in most grassland systems where topographic slope prevents feasible crop production; they are a primary component of rangelands, but are not necessarily water limited. Upland pastures include highlands, moorland, and other grasslands in regions of upland soils (said to have the potential for hydric inclusions, rather than definitive hydric inclusion; meaning there is potential for \\"saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions\\").  Locations  The term originates in the British Isles where upland pastures constitute 9 million hectares, 48% of agricultural land use in the UK. Upland pastures are widely managed in the United States in New England and Appalachia, and in semi-arid mountain regions in the inter- mountain west where their management is an important aspect of historic farming, wildlife preservation, and range livestock production. Upland pastures are also of primary importance to livestock production in western Australia, the Mongolian-Manchurian grassland ecoregion, in the Andes of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and western Brazil, in the Eurasian Steppes, in South Africa's Highveld, in Switzerland and the Alps, Sweden, Iceland, India, Juniper grasslands around Jabal Sawda in Saudi Arabia and other Juniper encroached grasslands in the Middle East including in Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Kazakhstan, as well as in eastern European nations, and, Tibet, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Canada, Kenya, Tanzania, Eritrea, Yemen, Ghana, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Syria, and Cantabria.

Description and history The Alphonso Johnson House is located in what is now a suburban residential area of southern Hamden, at the northwest corner of Gilbert and Circular Avenues. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, built with load-bearing brick walls and covered by a gabled roof. It has an L-shaped plan, with a 1-1/2 story brick ell to the right, and a 20th-century garage to the rear. The brick is laid in common bond, and the roof is of a shallow pitch typical of the Greek Revival period. The front facade is three bays wide, with the main entrance in the center bay, flanked by elongated sash windows. A single-story porch extends across the facade, with Italianate square paneled posts and a balustrade with heavy turned balusters. Most windows are rectangular sash, but there is one round-arch window, set on the east facade where it illuminates the stairwell. Most of the interior now has modern finishes, but some original period detailing remains in two of the downstairs rooms. With The house was built about 1859 by Alphonso Johnson, who grew up in a house (no longer standing) that was located across the street. The house was probably built using bricks made in the Johnson brickyard, which was located to the northwest on Wilmot Brook. It is one of a small number of brick houses to survive from the 19th century in the town, and has Italianate features reminiscent of the work of New Haven architect Henry Austin, applied to a more traditionally Greek Revival house shape.

He is best known for his anti-apartheid activism and subsequent death by the Security Branch of the apartheid-era South African Police Force in 1969. Early life and education Haron was born the youngest child from a family of five children. He was raised by his childless aunt on his father's side following his mother's death when he was still an infant. On 15 March 1950 he married Galiema Sadan and the couple later had three children. After graduating standard 6 from Talfalah Primary School he travelled to Mecca to pursue Islamic studies, where he was taught by Sheikh Alawi al-Maliki. He returned to Cape Town after two years and continued his studies with Sheikh Abdullah Taha Gamieldien and Shaykh Ismail Ganief. He was influenced by the thinking of the Teachers' League of South Africa and the Non-European Unity Movement through family members who were members of the organisations. Anti- apartheid activities He was made the Imam of the Al-Jamia Mosque in Claremont, Cape Town in 1955 where he setup discussion groups and engaged in anti-apartheid activities. In 1958 he established the Claremont Muslim Youth Association and went on to establish the community newspaper Muslim News (1960-1986). In the 1960s Haron met Pan African Congress (PAC) member and activist Barney Desai through whom he first contacted the PAC. In 1965 he was affected by the Group Areas Act and was forced to move from his family home on Jefferson Road, Lansdowne to Repulse Road in the demarcated Coloured neighbourhood of Athlone. Haron gave a number of speeches and sermons against apartheid policies and laws including a notable speech at the Cape Town Drill Hall on 7 May 1961 where he described the Group Areas Act as \\"inhuman, barbaric and un-Islamic\\". In 1968 he travelled to Mecca where he met Saudi King Faysal and Saudi Minister of Education Hasan \`Abdullah \`Ali Shaykh to discuss educational issues. He then went on to Cairo where he met PAC members and address a conference of Muslim representatives that was also attended by the PAC and African National Congress. He then went on to London via the Netherlands, where he met with the Director of the International University Exchange Fund, Lars Gunner Erickson. While abroad he was informed that he had become a target of the South African Security Branch and was advised to emigrate. He returned to Cape Town due to concerns for his father's ill health, after his application to emigrate to Canada was rejected. Death Haron was arrested shortly after his return to Cape Town when he was summoned to the Security Branch office at the Caledon Square Police Station (now Cape Town Central Police Station) on 28 May 1969. He was detained by police Special Branch member Spyker van Wyk and held in solitary confinement for 123 days, with daily interrogations about his involvement in the struggle. During this period United Party MP Catherine Taylor issued an official request for information into the reason for Haron's detention. The Minister of police stated that giving such information \\"was not in the public interest\\". In the morning of 27 September 1969 he died. The official government inquest, revealing that he had sustained two broken ribs and 27 bruises, into his death ruled that he died from falling down a flight of stairs. Haron's family and attorney argued that he had \\"died as a result of a heart attack which was triggered off by trauma\\". On 29 September, his funeral was attended by 40,000 mourners, with his coffin carried about to its final resting place in the Muslim cemetery in Mowbray. Abdullah Imam Haron South African History Online. On the night of his funeral, the most destructive earthquake in the recorded history of South Africa, with its epicentre at Tulbagh in the Western Cape. Aftermath, legacy and significance Haron was the first cleric of any faith to die in custody under the apartheid regime, thus signalling increased repression. On 6 October 1969, Haron was the first Muslim commemorated in St Paul's Cathedral in London. His friend, Canon John Collins, spoke of him as a martyr. After his 93-year-old widow, Galiema, died on the 50th anniversary of her husband's funeral on 29 September 2019, the imam's family demanded a fresh inquest into the cause of his death. Visual artist Haroon Gunn-Salie has created several works as memorials to Haron, including the 2019 installation \\"Crying for Justice\\" in the grounds of the Castle of Good Hope, symbolising 118 unmarked graves, one for each person who died in detention during apartheid years.

Developed by R.H. Bartels and G.W. Stewart in 1971, it was the first numerically stable method that could be systematically applied to solve such equations. The algorithm works by using the real Schur decompositions of A and B to transform AX - XB = C into a triangular system that can then be solved using forward or backward substitution. In 1979, G. Golub, C. Van Loan and S. Nash introduced an improved version of the algorithm, known as the Hessenberg‚ÄìSchur algorithm. It remains a standard approach for solving Sylvester equations when X is of small to moderate size.  The algorithm  Let X, C \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{m \\\\times n}, and assume that the eigenvalues of A are distinct from the eigenvalues of B. Then, the matrix equation AX - XB = C has a unique solution. The Bartels‚ÄìStewart algorithm computes X by applying the following steps: 1.Compute the real Schur decompositions : R = U^TAU, : S = V^TB^TV. The matrices R and S are block-upper triangular matrices, with diagonal blocks of size 1 \\\\times 1 or 2 \\\\times 2. 2\\\\. Set F = U^TCV. 3\\\\. Solve the simplified system RY - YS^T = F, where Y = U^TXV. This can be done using forward substitution on the blocks. Specifically, if s_{k-1, k} = 0, then : (R - s_{kk}I)y_k = f_{k} + \\\\sum_{j = k+1}^n s_{kj}y_j, where y_kis the kth column of Y. When s_{k-1, k} eq 0, columns [ y_{k-1} \\\\mid y_{k}] should be concatenated and solved for simultaneously. 4\\\\. Set X = UYV^T. = Computational cost = Using the QR algorithm, the real Schur decompositions in step 1 require approximately 10(m^3 + n^3) flops, so that the overall computational cost is 10(m^3 + n^3) + 2.5(mn^2 + nm^2). = Simplifications and special cases = In the special case where B=-A^T and C is symmetric, the solution X will also be symmetric. This symmetry can be exploited so that Y is found more efficiently in step 3 of the algorithm.  The Hessenberg‚ÄìSchur algorithm  The Hessenberg‚ÄìSchur algorithm replaces the decomposition R = U^TAU in step 1 with the decomposition H = Q^TAQ, where H is an upper- Hessenberg matrix. This leads to a system of the form HY - YS^T = F that can be solved using forward substitution. The advantage of this approach is that H = Q^TAQ can be found using Householder reflections at a cost of (5/3)m^3 flops, compared to the 10m^3 flops required to compute the real Schur decomposition of A.  Software and implementation  The subroutines required for the Hessenberg-Schur variant of the Bartels‚ÄìStewart algorithm are implemented in the SLICOT library. These are used in the MATLAB control system toolbox.  Alternative approaches  For large systems, the \\\\mathcal{O}(m^3 + n^3) cost of the Bartels‚ÄìStewart algorithm can be prohibitive. When A and B are sparse or structured, so that linear solves and matrix vector multiplies involving them are efficient, iterative algorithms can potentially perform better. These include projection-based methods, which use Krylov subspace iterations, methods based on the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration, and hybridizations that involve both projection and ADI. Iterative methods can also be used to directly construct low rank approximations to X when solving AX-XB = C.

Earlier in her career Pizan wrote many texts includingThe Book of the City of Ladies which included tales about infamous woman in history. In her last work \\"The Tale of Joan of Arc\\" Pizan writes 61 verses about Joan of Arc, who led the French army to reclaim territory being held by the English. It was written before Joan lost in battle and was taken as a prisoner and right before the death of Christine de Pizan herself.  Stanzas  The poem is composed of 61 stanzas that begins with the introduction of Christine. Originally written in French as \\"Le Ditie de Jehanne d'Arc\\", the poem was translated by Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski. The prologue is composed of 12 stanzas, followed by 46 stanzas which comprise the main story, and ending with stanzas 60 and 61, which serve as a conclusion. The entire story, sometimes referred to as \\"The Song of Joan of Arc,\\" is a lyric delivered in first person voice. Christine, who have wept for eleven years in a walled abbey where I have lived ever since Charles (how strange this is!) the King's son - dare I say it? - fled in haste from Paris, I who have lived enclosed there on account of the treachery, now, for the very first time, begin to laugh; Stanza 10: Who, then, has seen something so extraordinary occur - which should be noted and remembered in all regions -...

Amen. Stanza 61: This poem was finished by Christine in the above-mentioned year 1429, on the day that ends July.

Christine de Pizan was a professional writer in the court of King Charles VI of France. Pizan is said to have died before Joan was captured. Joan of Arc led the French army in May 1429 to end a siege in Orleans and was victorious because within a day the English were forced to retreat. The poetic story written by Christine de Pizan emphasizes victory. However, Joan's battle to reclaim Paris in September 1429 was unsuccessful. Joan of Arc was captured in 1430 and burned at the stake on May 30, 1432 The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Article Title: Christine de Pizan Website Name: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Publisher: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, inc. Date Published: May 01, 2017 URL: https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christine-de-Pisan after a series of trials by the English, through the church, about her attire and because she said that God spoke to her and that she listened. Pizan spent the last of her days at the monastery of Poissy and this is where she wrote \\"The Tale of Joan of Arc\\".  Summary  During the prologue, Christine proclaims that the sun began to shine in 1429. After years in an abbey where she felt as though she lived locked in a cage, hope was beginning to shine its light for her and for all, and that all the people could thank God for this new season of happiness that was now upon them. She speaks of the exiled King of France and the troubles that all of the people had suffered due to this. Then she declares it is time to celebrate and welcome back the king. In stanza 10, Christine begins to explain how this change of fortune had occurred. In stanza 11, Christine states that a tender virgin has come to help them, a gift from God. The story begins in stanza 13 because here she begins to introduce the \\"Maid\\" who by God's grace has proclaimed victories over their enemies at long last. Christine speaks of a prophesy. She then explains how Joan has shown that she has helped to reward all the people with noble gifts from God and the Holy Spirit and she questions how we can we ever repay Joan. Christine devotes stanzas to powerful women from the apocrypha bible books and legends of the past and then states that Joan has surpassed even them. Christine sees the victories as a glory of the female sex and something that ten thousand men could not have done! The following stanzas are dedicated to honoring Joan as a warrior and her battles, stating that all of Christiandom stands behind her. Christine says that Joan was a gift from God to those on earth, because she showed a courage that no man would. The story begins to come to a conclusion when Christine states that the people should celebrate Charles, their rightful king, for he is who Joan fought for. The last stanzas are a prayer that all of the people will turn to God and live in peace. In her final lines, Christine states \\"But I understand that some people may not be satisfied with its contents\\" which has led to speculation that perhaps Christine could not freely write all that she wished to impart to her readers in the poem. She states, \\"for if one's head is lowered and one's eyes are heavy one cannot look at the light.\\" Then finally: \\"Here ends a most beautiful poem written by Christine.\\"  Criticism  Kevin Brownlee, who has written translations of Christine de Pizan's work alongside Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski wrote a book titled Discourses of Authority in Medieval and Renaissance Literature which contains a chapter of analysis for \\"the modern reader to understand that the Ditie was a celebration\\" by examining the question of authority, both literary and historical, that Pizan employs in the work.Discourses of Authority in Medieval and Renaissance Literature, ed. Kevin Browlnee and Walter Stephens (Dartmouth, N.H.:University Press of New England, 1989. Beatrice Gottlieb wrote a criticism titled \\"The Problem of Feminism in the Fifteenth Century\\" which is an analysis that states, \\"Christine could not, of course, be called a feminist before the word existed,\\" which has been a topic of academic study.Included in Norton Anthology: The Selected Writings of Christine de Pizan in \\"Criticisms\\", W.W.

It is located between and stations. The M25 motorway passes beneath it between junctions 16 and 17 at Gerrards Cross near Chalfont St Peter, from where the bridge gets its name. The bridge is known as Chalfont No. 1 Viaduct; the longer Chalfont No. 2 Viaduct is a short distance to the west and spans the A413. The bridge is noted as a local landmark because for more than 20 years it bore a graffiti slogan, \\"'\\" painted in large white letters on the south-facing parapet.  Construction  The River Misbourne diverted via culverts under the M25 The Chalfont Viaduct is built of blue and black engineering brick with additional decorative brickwork. The bridge is approximately high, although it varies in height due to changing ground level, and it has five semi-elliptical arches, each wide. It was constructed between 1902 and 1906 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) to carry trains on the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway between London and across the River Misbourne. It was designed by James Charles Inglis, chief civil engineer of the GWR, and assistant engineer Robert Cherry Sikes. In the mid-1980s the construction of the M25 motorway required the Misbourne to be diverted via underground concrete culverts. The route of the motorway was aligned to pass through the arches of the Chalfont Viaduct, leaving the viaduct largely unaltered apart from the raised ground level and the addition of concrete supports and crash barriers. The viaduct is the only brick-built bridge on this section of the M25.  Graffiti  The new \\"\\" graffiti slogan added in 2018 For many years the Chalfont Viaduct bore a graffiti slogan, \\"\\" painted in large white letters on the south-facing parapet, visible to M25 drivers heading in a clockwise direction. The north side of the bridge bears the painted legend \\"\\". Originally, the graffiti on the south parapet simply read \\"\\". It is thought that \\"Peas\\" was the tag of a London graffiti artist which can be seen on other locations. The words \\"give\\" and \\"a chance\\" were added later. The altered slogan may refer to the artist being repeatedly arrested, and it may also be a play on words in reference to John Lennon's popular 1969 song, \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". The graffiti became a popular local landmark and was regarded affectionately by motorists and residents in nearby settlements as a reassuring location marker. In 2018, when the graffiti was partially removed and repainted by an unknown artist to read \\"\\", it prompted media commentary. It has been speculated that the new graffiti may be related to similar slogans being painted on buildings in the London borough of Harrow., and several other bridges along the M25 and M1 motorways all following the similar, heavily serif-ed style/typeface. The reception towards this modification was largely negative, to the point that a petition to Network Rail to reinstate the previous slogan and make the bridge a listed building was produced, and received over 2,000 signatures. In March 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, an unknown artist replaced the graffiti with one reading \\"\\".

He was commander or acting governor in Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe and Martinique. He was appointed governor of Grenada but died before taking office. Early years (1661‚Äì95) Bonnaventure-Fran√ßois de Boisferm√© was born in 1661 in Saint-Michel-sur-Loire, Indre-et-Loire. His family was of the old nobility. On 1 January 1691 he was a lieutenant of the artillery. Marie-Galante (1695‚Äì1702) On 1 January 1695 Boisferm√© was the king's lieutenant on Marie-Galante. Charles Auger, nominal governor of Marie- Galante, was named governor of Guadeloupe on 21 August 1695 and was replaced by a M. de Lauri√©re. Lauri√©re died soon after and Boisferm√© was named to replace him as governor of Marie-Galante. He was appointed on 1 September 1696. To compensate Marie-Galante for the destruction that had been caused by the English, on 3 November 1699 the king free the island from all taxes for four years. Boisferm√© held office until 1702. Guadeloupe (1702‚Äì05) Boisferm√© was commander in Guadeloupe from 8 November 1702. Marie-Galante was again taken and ruined by the English on 6 March 1703. On 19 March 1703, the English invasion fleet under Walker and Christopher Codrington was sighted off the south of Guadeloupe. Over the next few days the English disembarked over 4,000 troops at three landing points, forcing back the French defenders to Fort Saint Charles in Basse-Terre. On 3 April 1703, a French fleet arrived under Jean Gabaret, lieutenant general for the French Antilles, with 820 men from Martinique. The subordinate commanders included Boisferm√©, Louis Gaston Caquery de Valmeni√®re, Jean Clair Dyel Du Parquet, Fran√ßois de Collart and Jean Du Buc. An attempt to hold Fort Francis failed and the French were forced to the east. Gabaret adopted scorched earth tactics, destroying resources before falling back into the interior, then harassing the English while disease, drink and lack of food reduced their strength. They abandoned Guadeloupe on 15 May 1703 after causing great material damage but few French casualties. A royal decree of 1 May 1703 made Auger governor of Tortuga and the Coast of Saint-Domingue in place of Jean-Baptiste du Casse, squadron commander of the naval armies of America. Boisferm√© was interim governor of Guadeloupe from 1703 to 1705. Last years (1705‚Äì22) Boisferm√© was succeeded in Guadeloupe in 1705 by Robert Cloche de La Malmaison. The French regained Marie-Galante in 1706. Boisferm√© was made commander at Fort Royal, Martinique on 2 November 1705. He was interim commander of Martinique in the absence of a governor from 1712 to 1713. On 8 February 1712 in Fort Royal he married Catherine Le Boucher, widow of Emmanuel Nadau du Triel and mother of Charles Fran√ßois Emmanuel Nadau du Treil, future governor of Guadeloupe. In letter of 20 May 1713 J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux wrote that Boisferm√© was the natural choice for governor of Marie-Galante, although he might not want to return, being mortified by the appointment of Malmaison as governor of Guadeloupe. He had excellent military qualities and had proved his loyalty by losing an arm in the service of the king. He had performed well as commander of Guadeloupe when Malmaison was lieutenant of the king. Boisferm√© was appointed the commander of Marie-Galante on 1 August 1714. Charles de Brunier de Larnage was appointed royal lieutenant of Marie-Galante, taking office on 23 August 1714. Boisferm√© was made governor of Grenada on 1 December 1722. He succeeded Jean Balthazar du Houx, who had died on 29 August 1722. Boisferm√© died in Martinique on 11 December 1722. He was succeeded in Grenada by Robert Giraut du Poyet, who held office from 1723 to 1727. Robert Philippe de Longvilliers de Poincy, captain general of Saint-Christophe, became the next governor of Marie-Galante.

Life and work  After graduating from high school, Finkelde studied philosophy, theology and literature in Berlin, Munich and Paris. In 2003, he earned his doctorate with a thesis on Walter Benjamin (Benjamin reads Proust) at the Munich School of Philosophy. Parallel to his studies, he joined the Jesuit Order in 1996 and began further education there. During the Magisterium, a two-year period of practical experience, he worked in the pastoral work in Mexico City and as lecturer of philosophy at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Dominik Finkelde was ordained as a Catholic priest by the Freiburg Bishop in June 2009 in the Cathedral of . He was assistant professor at the Munich School of Philosophy between 2010 and 2015 and habilitated at the Institute of Philosophy at the Goethe University Frankfurt am Main in 2014. Since 2015 he has been professor of contemporary philosophy and epistemology at the Munich School of Philosophy. Since the mid-1990s, Finkelde has emerged as the author of dramatic and scientific texts. In 1996, he received the Gerhart Hauptmann Prize (together with Jens Roselt) for his first play, \\"Abendgru√ü\\", which premiered in 1998 at the Theater Madgeburg, depicting the fictitious biography of a former East German border guard. In the award of the jury, Klaus V√∂lker wrote: \\"Here we have a small, very sensitive and cautiously depicted family drama ... in the tradition of Ibsen\\". His dystopia Berlin Underground is about the breakup of the two-class society in the near future and was premiered in 1999 by the Landesb√ºhne Niedersachsen Nord in Wilhelmshaven. Other plays by Finkelde were staged in Bielefeld, Augsburg and Cottbus.  Bibliography  = Philosophy = * Benjamin liest Proust. Mimesislehre-Sprachtheorie-Poetologie.

Description  The abstract painting is painted in the fall colours scarlet, emerald green, gold- end lemon yellow with spots of violet and Prussian blue. The complicated and tedious, repeatedly interrupted process of its creation remains visible in the picture. The paint stripes or stains, which are quickly and randomly applied with a brush, are drawn down to the lower edge of the picture with the aid of a squeegee on the canvas, they dry, layers of other colours are applied here and there. Again, distributed with the squeegee randomly, they dry again, colour layers are here and there scraped off to the ground. These processes are repeated until the painter considers the painting as completed. The vertical and horizontal lines created by the movement of the board seem to give the picture, with its abundance of colours, a certain structure and convey a certain aspect of calm and harmony. Its creation process remains recognizable in the painting, but at the same time remains \\"veiled\\". According to the artist, these paintings are to a considerable extent dependent on chance and often contradict in their final version of his initial image idea. The painting is signed, numbered and dated on the reverse.  Bibliography  *Gerhard Richter. Catalogue Raisonn√© 1993-2004. Dusseldorf 2005. P. 270 and 309, Nr. 809‚Äì1.

She is a Professor of Linguistics at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. She is the author and coauthor of six books and has published numerous articles on micro-syntactic variation, clause types, and sentential negation. She completed her Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1991 under Anthony Kroch and Richard S. Kayne, and her dissertation is entitled Syntactic Properties of Sentential Negation. A Comparative Study of Romance Languages. Since completing her Ph.D, she has held academic appointments at Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, and Yale University. Research The majority of Zanuttini's research falls into three categories: micro-syntactic variation, clause types, and sentential negation. Micro-syntactic variation refers to minute differences between different varieties of a language spoken in a given geographic region. Zanuttini's studies within this area focus on romance languages and minority varieties of English in North America, specifically Appalachian English. Her work with clause types involves giving more precise definition to, and differentiation between different types of clausal constructions such as declarative, exclamative, and imperative clauses. Zanuttini founded the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project in 2011. Members of the project, housed at Yale University, conduct research on minority varieties of English spoken in North America and micro-syntactic differences between them. Presently, Zanuttini remains a leader of the project, alongside Laurence Horn and Jim Wood. She has received three major grants from the National Science Foundation (2003‚Äì2005, 2006‚Äì2008, and 2014‚Äì2017) to conduct collaborative research on minority varieties of English. Teaching Zanuttini is currently a Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) in the Department of Linguistics at Yale University. She teaches both undergraduate and graduate level courses in Syntax. Prior to beginning her tenure at Yale in 2008, Zanuttini was both an Assistant Professor (1992‚Äì1997) and an Associate Professor (1997‚Äì2008) in the Department of Linguistics at Georgetown University.

It was released in the United States by Plume and follows the lives of a Mexican-American migrant family working in the California grape fields.  Plot  The book follows Estrella and her family as they arrive in Central Valley and must deal with several challenges. The family works in the grape fields, where they are paid very little for what is grueling labor. Estrella soon meets Alejo and the pair fall in love. Tragedy strikes when Alejo is sprayed with pesticides and falls gravely ill. Estrella's mother, Petra, also discovers that she is pregnant, which complicates matters. As Alejo grows increasingly more ill, Estrella and her family take Alejo to see a nurse at the nearest clinic, who charges them $10 for an office visit, in which the nurse only confirms to them that Alejo is sick. Unable to pay the fee completely, Petra's companion Perfecto offers to fix the clinic's plumbing in lieu of payment, but she declines. The nurse tells the family to take Alejo to the hospital, which is 20 miles away. As the nurse has what little money they had, a desperate Estrella smashes the desk at the clinic with a crowbar until the nurse returns the money, which they use on gas to reach the hospital. Once at the hospital, Estrella and her family must leave Alejo there alone, out of fear of law enforcement searching for them due to the clinic visit, since they knew that the hospital couldn't refuse him aid. Alejo is taken into the hospital, where there is a risk that she may never see him again. Petra, looking under the feet of a Jesus statue, sees the birth certificates of her five children, and the marriage certificate from when she married her husband in Santa Ana. She views these documents as proof against immigration if anyone tries to wrongly deport her children. Petra is contemplative about her life, her struggles, her daughter's affection for someone like her first husband, and the growing life in her belly. Perfecto, too, worries about how he can afford to bring another life into the world when they are struggling to survive. He feels old, too tired to be starting another family, and homesick for the home of his youth. Estrella gets up in the night, puts on her overalls, and goes alone to the barn mentioned several times in the book. She climbs a chain to the roof and there finds new strength and a conviction that her heart is powerful enough to \\"summon home all those who strayed.\\"  Characters  * Petra ‚Äì Mother and leader of the family. * Estrella ‚Äì Estrella, sometimes referred to as Star, a nickname given to her by her father, is the thirteen-year-old daughter of Petra, and eldest of children. She often helps her mother take care of her younger siblings. * Alejo ‚Äì Fifteen-year old cousin to Gumecindo. He lives and works with his cousin after his mother passes away. His grandma lives in Edinburg, Texas and he sends money back to help her. He works in the same grape fields as Estrella and the two meet and fall in love. * Perfecto Flores ‚Äì Petra's companion after her first husband walks out on the family, leaving her alone with young children to raise. * Twin girls Perla and Cookie - Perla and Cookie are the young twin girls of the family. * Ricky - Younger brother of Estrella. * Arnulfo - Estrella's other younger brother. * Gumecindo - The only family member Alejo has in California. Both Gumicindo and Alejo work in the grape fields. * Maxine Devridge - Blond haired and blue-eyed, Maxine is Estrella's childhood friend back home before the family moves.  Themes  According to scholars such as Sharla Hutchison, the book comments on many themes and elements such as Chicano culture and bilingualism, migrant working conditions, and American mainstream culture and consumerism. Jeehyun Lim noted in a 2010 article for Women's Studies Quarterly that Viramontes's combined use of English and Spanish could be seen as a possible form of conflicted identity for the character of Estrella, who is also at the cusp of womanhood and deciding how she will live her life in the future. Writing for Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment, C. Grewe-Volpp writes on the topic of migrant working conditions and environmental injustice seen in the book, citing the character Alejo's story of the La Brea Tar Pits, in which he tells Estrella they found human bones under the ground as well as his exposure to sprayed fertilizer. In an article for The Journal of Popular Culture, Sharla Hutchison notes the commentary on consumerism through the products used by the family, as Estrella learns how to read from household brand products advertisements and the character's own commentary on the artwork featured on a box of Sun-Maid raisins, as Estrella opines that the mascot will never know the pain and exploitation of the migrant labor needed to gather grapes.  Reception  Under the Feet of Jesus has received reviews from outlets such as The Radical Teacher, Chasqui, and Los Angeles Times, the latter of which compared Viramontes to John Steinbeck and wrote that \\"Viramontes' prose is thick and lush, like the grape fields where migrant workers labor under the hot sun. There is passion here, but the author avoids easy sentimentality.\\" = Awards = * Helena Maria Viramontes was awarded the John Dos Passos award for Literature in 1995. * This book was a finalist for the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writers Award.

Ball of C&C; Design for long range cruising and first built in 1981. Production The design was built under Erich Bruckmann's supervision at the Custom Division of C&C; Yachts in Canada, but it is now out of production. At least two examples were built. The Custom 62 is a development of the C&C; 61\\\\. =Jubilation (1981)= The first Custom 62 was built in a conventional aft cockpit layout with the wheel aft of the mizzen and a keel / centreboard arrangement allowing a draft with the centreboard up. She has a cherry-wood interior. She was renamed over the years as she changed owners, Djinn, Marauder, and now Lilia. =Pegaso (1982)= C&C; Yachts built at least one other Custom 62 for an American couple, this one as a center cockpit version with an open pilot house. It has a fixed fin keel giving an draft. The boat was named Pegaso and intended for long-range, short-handed sailing, primarily in the Pacific northwest. It has two helm stations, the first in the pilothouse, while the second helm station is aft, just forward of the mizzen mast. The interior is finished in teak with off-white panelling. Design The C&C; Custom 62 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with double balsawood cores (glass/balsa/glass/balsa/glass), using the same construction method as the C&C; 61\\\\. The hull has extra reinforcement at the stem, amidships, and transom against potential strikes with submerged objects. It has a double headsail ketch rig, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel via a Wagner hydraulic system with redundant pumps, lines and cylinders. The boat displaces and carries of ballast. The design has a draft of with the standard keel fitted or, with the keel / centreboard arrangement, draft with the centreboard up. =Accommodations= In Pegaso accommodations include: crew accommodations forward with adjustable pipe berths, a workbench, spares cabinet, and sail bins; a double stateroom with washstand (and head opposite); aft a master stateroom, with a walk-around double berth, large hanging lockers, a desk, and a filing cabinet. An inch-thick port window under the bed allows inspecting the feathering propeller. The salon has a U-dinette table and extensive bookshelves with a settee and pilot berth opposite. The galley is on the port side, has a \\"U\\" shape, with three sinks, a range powered by propane and a large oven. It also has a toaster, microwave oven and a top-opening refrigerator and freezer. Marauder's interior was laid out somewhat differently. =Systems (Pegaso)= Main engine: fitted with a Caterpillar Inc. diesel engine of , turning a Luke 30x24 feathering propellor and carries fuel for a motoring range. Electrics: There are two Onan generators of to power the freezer and clothes drier. Navigation Equipment: In pilot house: * Brooks & Gatehouse instruments * Wagner autopilot * Compass Navigation station in saloon: * Furuno alarm radar * Furuno weatherfax * Magnavox Satellite navigation * Northstar Loran-C * Brooks & Gatehouse Hadrian course computer * 2 of ICOM 720A transceivers * Sailor Marine VHF radio Operational history In a review for Yachting magazine, in May 1983, David Weatherston wrote: \\"My sea trial aboard Pegaso, on Lake Ontario last November, proved the yacht worthy of her racing heritage. She was responsive, even in a seaway. She tracked smoothly. And under autopilot she required very little corrective steering. On a reach, in brisk conditions, she carried her sail area stiffly, and with an easy motion that would keep any crew in high spirits.\\" A review in May 1983 in Cruising World magazine stated, \\"Like all other boats produced from their yard, the 62 combines good looks, performance and comfortable living space. It's good to see that a reputable production yard is making the extra effort to tailor large yachts to owners' needs ‚Äîcertainly they have the experience and skill.\\" Popular culture The Custom 62, Pegaso, was featured in a book, Just the Two of Us, by Alicia Blodgett, a book about sailing, about a newlywed couple's adjustment to life at sea and each other, through 47 countries and 45,000 miles. The book was published by Summit in 1999. Of Pegaso, Bill Blodgett, husband and sailing partner of Alicia Blodgett, said: > My tribute to Pegaso is she carried its two different Mom and Pop owners > around the world safely and comfortably while averaging 200 miles a day > crossing the Pacific.

The project is currently directed by Martin Foys and Heather Wacha, and continues to grow as new contributors join the project and edit new medieval maps.

MS 10049, f. 64r) * Unfinished Anglo-Saxon Mappa Mundi (CCCC 265, p. 210)  Medieval maps of the world  Traditionally, western European medieval mappaemundi, or world maps, have been divided into two categories: T-O maps and zonal maps. T-O maps are names as such because of their tripartite structure - a T rests inside an O, dividing the world into the three known continents. At the top is Asia, the bottom left quadrant contains areas of Europe, and the bottom right quadrant Africa. The orientation of T-O maps is usually shifted 90 degrees to the left, such that the cardinal direction of east, i.e. paradise, India and parts of Asia for a medieval mind are located at the very top of the map. Zonal maps, however, are usually oriented with north at the top, and the world is divided into four latitudinal zones that represent climate and indicate appropriateness for habitation.Woodward, David. ‚ÄúMedieval Mappaemundi,‚Äù in The History of Cartography, Vol. 1: Cartography in Prehistoric, Ancient, and Medieval Europe and the Mediterranean, edited by J. B. Harley and David Woodward (University of Chicago Press, 1987), 292. Both types of medieval maps are included in the Virtual Mappa project.  Project history and support  The project came out of digital humanities research by project leader Martin Foys of medieval artifacts and media that resisted traditional modes of print-based scholarship. Medieval mappamundi represented a problem of representation and analysis that digital tools and techniques could help address. The digital humanities resource of digital annotation and linking tools that was developed to collect, annotate and network medieval maps was Digital Mappa, which is now its own freely-available online workspace and digital publishing platform. As part of the Digital Mappa (DM) platform, Virtual Mappa has been funded by grants by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  References  Project Citation Virtual Mappa: Digital Editions of Early Medieval Maps of the World, edit. Martin Foys, Heather Wacha, et al.

Ridley's first book published. It is a science book for children talking about different sea animals. Annie E. Ridley (1839‚Äì1923) was a Victorian novelist who wrote books regarding women's education and a science book for children. Not only was Ridley an author, but she was the governor of the Camden School for Girls in London for twenty-four years. She was successful enough to own her own house. Ridley was also involved with the Headmistresses' Association and the Teacher's Guild. Ridley worked with Frances Mary Buss, a pioneer of women's education, and Ridley went on to inspire people like Ellice Hopkins.  Life  Annie E. Ridley was born on 2 May 1839 in Houghton Le Spring, Durham, England to parents John Ridley (1806‚Äì1887) and Mary White Pybus (1807‚Äì1884). At her birth, she had an older sister Mary Elizabeth Ridley who was born in 1836. When Annie was three months old her family moved to Hindmarsh, South Australia, Australia. Her father wanted to help colonize Australia and help make a great settlement. After a six-month voyage on the boat called the Warrior, the Ridley family arrived at Port Adelaide in Australia. From there they proceeded a few miles to Hindmarsh where they lived in a mud house while a wooden one was being constructed. Soon their new home was built with a fireplace, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms, and an office. However, three tragic events occurred. First, the oldest daughter, Mary Elizabeth, went too close to the fireplace and her clothes caught on fire. She died hours later from the severe Burns. Next, Mrs. Ridley gave birth to another daughter but that daughter died months later. Lastly, a son was born and he died soon after. This causes Annie to grow up without many Children her age. This is the house the Ridley family lived in while at Hindmarsh, South Australia. Annie recalls that growing up in Australia caused her to view the world from a unique perspective. In the strange land of Australia, there were not many things to do. All she could do was play around in nature. She and her mother would plant Gardens with her mom explaining every type of plant. This sparked her interest in nature. In September 1845, Annie's little sister Jane Taylor Ridley was born in Hindmarsh, Australia. As her mother was now taking care of another little girl, this gave Annie more freedom to go outside and explore more. Her father, John Ridley, planned to have his daughter learn through nature before ever picking up a book. In fact, he decided she would not touch a book until she was the age of seven. Ultimately, his plan ended two years early when Annie found herself wandering into a school near by her house and joining the class. This occurred when Annie was five years old marking the beginning of her schooling. Then at the age of twelve, Annie fell in love with reading after discovering Alfred Tennyson's poem The Princess. This poem inspired her then and in life to promote women's education. In her book about her father's life, Annie goes on to explain how her father was her inspiration. He was always conducting science Experiments and as Annie got older, he invited her to join him. This further fostered her love of science. Around this time, the Ridley family, also bought some land by the bay. They would spend summer's here, and it allowed Annie to explore new Landscapes and new Animals. Annie thus started a journal to record all the things she was seeing and feeling. At one point she writes this down, \\"Papa says he hopes that when I am a woman I shall write a good book. I think myself that I would rather be a happy woman.\\" Finally, in 1853 the Ridley family returned to England on the ship called the Melbourne. Upon their return, Annie was immediately sent away to school. The head of the school was Miss Darke. While Annie was away at school, her father wrote her letters every week. Then in 1856, the Ridley family started to travel around Europe visiting Ireland, Germany, France and many other places. In 1858 they finally settled down in the Tyne valley near Hexham. Here they lived in a house called the Stagshaw Close House. They remained here till 1862. This is the Stagshaw Close House where the Ridley family lived in for a few years. In 1862, the Ridley family moved to 19 Belsize Park, Hampstead, London, England. Then in 1865, Annie E, Ridley published her debut novel, Under the waves: or The hermit-crab 'in society'. This book marked her one and only science book for children. Then in 1868, Annie was baptized at the Christ Church in Hampstead, Camden, England. In 1884, Annie's mother Mary White Pybus died. A couple years later in 1887 John Ridley died as well leaving Annie and Jane on their own. In 1889 the sisters commissioned the local Hampstead architect, Horace Field, to design a house for them at 31 Daleham Gardens, Hampstead, which they named Stagshaw.Horace Field's FRIBA application statement. A drawing of the house exhibited at the 1890 summer exhibition of the Royal Academy, Cat no.1671, also published in the Annual Architectural Review 1889, page 79 This is Mary White Pybus.

The original designs from the 19th century were, like the stained glass windows themselves, destroyed in World War II and no longer available. It was planned to make a memorial to the German martyrs of the twentieth century, such as Edith Stein and Maximilian Kolbe, and to commemorate the Holocaust. The visual designs of the commissioned artists and Manfred H√ºrlimann could not convince the cathedral chapter, but the abstract design by Gerhard Richter, who had been asked to provide one by master builder Barbara Schock-Werner did. He had cut up a photo of his painting 4096 farben from 1974 and pasted it behind the tracery of the window. In 2005 the cathedral chapter asked Richter to develop the design further. In 2006, the artist was finally commissioned. The in manufacturing costs were funded by about 1,200 donors; Gerhard Richter himself worked without a fee.  Execution  From a palette of 800, Richter chose 72 colours that were also in use in the medieval windows of the cathedral and those of the 19th century. The coloured squares were arranged by a random number generator. Reflections and repetitions were predetermined, the lanes 1 and 3, 2 and 5 as well as 4 and 6 mirror each other. At a few spots Richter made corrections to the distribution, for example where the arrangement of the pixel was suggestive of meaning, for example in the lower part the number \\"1\\". Richter said to that: \\"I rather held myself back. I wanted the window to have something self-evident, something everyday, at least it should not be 'color noise'. Not too warm, not too cold, restrained, as neutral as possible.\\" \\"This interaction of chance and calculation created an abstract 'colour-tone carpet' whose particles glow in the light of day and are not held together with lead cames, but fixed on a support disc with silicone gel, so that the coloured facets interact without the usual lines in the glass painting. In addition, the different incidence of light continually changes the colour effect of the window\\". The window was fabricated by Derix Glasstudios.  Reception  Georg Imdahl wrote in the K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger: \\"In the 60s Richter painted his first colour grids as an attack against the falsehood and piety, how abstraction was celebrated, with phoney reverence; downright fulminating against \\"devotional art\\" and \\"religious applied arts\\", as which the grids were celebrated\\".‚ÄûDie g√∂ttlichen Farbpixel‚Äú, K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger, 24. August 2007. Master builder Barbara Schock-Werner: \\"Stained glass can only be done on the premises\\". Initial designs had a \\"bathroom touch\\" or would have emitted the light of a \\"tavern glazing\\". Richter himself found one of the designs \\"too christmass-like\\". Cologne cardinal Joachim Meisner, who was not part of the cathedral chapter, strongly criticized the window: \\"The window would be better suited to a mosque or another house of prayer. If we're going to have a new window, it should be one that reflects our faith. Not just any.\\" In Islam, pictorial representations of people (as created in God's image) are prohibited. The statement was later relativized by the spokesman of the archdiocese, but it nevertheless came to nationwide attention in the media. \\"In seiner √ºberw√§ltigenden Farbenf√ºlle ist es selbst eine Symphonie des Lichts, in der alle Farben des Doms erklingen\\", \\"In its overwhelming abundance of colours, it is itself a symphony of light in which all the colours of the cathedral ring out\\" concluded Josef Sauerborn, artist pastor of the Cologne diocese, in his sermon at the festival service on the occasion of the unveiling in August 2007. \\"Dieses Fenster stellt nichts Religi√∂ses dar\\" \\"This window does not represent anything religious\\", explained provost in 2006, \\"but a challenge to seeing; it invites silence, it creates a light shimmering with colours, it animates, inspirits, calls for meditation and creates a flair that opens for the religious\\". The window also found the approval of those responsible for the Reims Cathedral, who also considered Richter for the design of a window; after Richter declined, the commission was given to the artist Imi Knoebel.

It is located 52 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Camden Council and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Harrington Grove is a masterplanned residential community situated within the Harrington Park estate and managed by Harrington Estates on behalf of the estate of Lady Mary Fairfax.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/macarthur/harrington- estates-pays-tribute-to-lady-mary-fairfax-and-honours-her-life-and-links-to- the-macarthur-area/news- History Harrington Grove was originally part of 1620 acres granted to Edward Lord by Governor Macquarie in 1815. He called this property Orielton after the Orielton estate in Pembroke, Wales, that the Lord family had previously inherited. The neighbouring property, Harrington Park, was part of a 2,000 acre property granted to trader Captain William Douglas Campbell as compensation for the loss of his snow Harrington which was seized by convicts, from its anchorage in Sydney Harbour, on the evening of 15 May 1808.For the grant of land to Campbell see Governor Lachlan Macquarie to Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, 28 Jun. 1813, in Historical Records of Australia, Series I, Volume VII, pages 707-30 (paragraph 21); and The National Archives of the UK, CO 201/67. In March 1809, His Majesty‚Äôs Ship Dedaigneuse fell in with the Harrington near Manilla, in the Philippines, and after a short engagement the vessel was driven on shore and totally destroyed.Seizure of the Harrington was reported in the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser on 22 and 29 May 1808 and 20 and 27 August 1809. Campbell called the land Harrington Park in remembrance of his vessel. In 1944, Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax (at that time Director of John Fairfax Ltd) bought both properties from Arthur and Elaine Swan.http://www.camdenhistory.org.au Until 1976, Fairfax ran a Poll Hereford stud where he bred many show winning champions.https://camdenhistorynotes.wordpress.com/ As part of the purchase, Sir Warwick inherited the Orielton Homestead, a 26-room, state heritage- significant property that had a colourful past across almost two centuries, under 13 owners. In 2018, a three-year restoration of the homestead was completed by the development company for the Lady Mary Fairfax Estate, Harrington Estates.

Most ministers are responsible for a specific area of Austrian public administration and stand at the head of a specific department of the Austrian bureaucracy; ministers without portfolio exist and used to be common in the First Austrian Republic but are rare today. Most ministers control a ministry; some ministers control a section () of the Chancellery, the ministry headed by the chancellor. A minister is the supreme executive organ within his or her area of responsibility: ministers do not take orders from either the president or the chancellor; their decisions are subject to judicial review but cannot be overruled by any other part of the executive branch.  Terminology  The Federal Constitutional Law, the backbone of the Austrian constitution, states that \\"the government consists of the chancellor, the vice chancellor, and the other ministers\\" (\\"\\"). The Austrian general public usually does not think of the chancellor and the vice chancellor as \\"ministers\\". In the popular media and in everyday language in general, chancellor and vice chancellor are almost always referred to by their titles; the word \\"ministers\\" is almost always used to mean ministers chancellor and vice chancellor. Additionally, the state secretaries are sometimes referred to as members of the government. Legally, however, \\"minister\\" and \\"member of government\\" (\\"\\", \\"\\") are exactly synonymous.  Powers and responsibilities  = Administration = Grete Rehor was Austria's first female minister, leading the Ministry of Social Affairs from 1966 to 1970 Generally speaking, a minister is responsible for a specific topic area of public administration: the minister of the interior is responsible e.g. for public safety and for the correct conduct of elections and plebiscites; the minister of finance is responsible for tax collection, the preparation of budgets, and for certain aspects of economic policy; the minister of education runs the public school system; the minister of justice provides administrative assistance and facilities management for the judiciary; and so on. The minister is assisted by a department usually, although not always, called a ministry (). Ministers can be given control of more than one ministry. Within his or her area of responsibility, the minister is the supreme executive organ. He or she is vested with management authority (), meaning the minister is in charge of setting policy, of most personnel decisions, and of the internal governance and discipline of their respective departments. He or she also has injunction authority (), the power to issue orders () to the civil servants in their respective departments that require or prohibit specific substantive acts and decisions. Both powers follow from the postulate that supreme executive organs hold ultimate responsibility; an organ cannot be considered responsible for what it cannot effectively control. There are departures from this general principle, however. Some subdivisions of ministerial bureaucracies can be declared \\"independent\\" (\\"\\") by law; an \\"independent\\" subdivision is subject to management authority but not injunction authority. = Delegated presidential powers = Minister of Justice Josef Moser is in charge of appointing Austria's judges in the president's stead An important part of the responsibilities of most ministers is personnel decisions. Austria distinguishes between two basic types of civil servants: a is a regular employee subject to regular labor law; a is a career civil servant with an effective lifetime appointment ‚Äì a can only be terminated for cause and enjoys robust protections against unfavorable transfer or reassignment. The class of civil servants of rank, the , includes judges, prosecutors, military officers, police officers, full professors at public universities, and all senior administrators. In the past, it also used to include most other government workers, from local revenue office clerks to school teachers. As a general rule, the responsibility for appointing national-level is vested in the president. The constitution permits the president to delegate most of these appointments to the relevant ministers, however. Appointments of members of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Administrative Court have to be made by the president personally, but appointments of the benches of general courts, for example, can be delegated to the minister of justice. Presidents make liberal use of their ability to delegate personnel decisions. With the exception of members of top courts, principals of public secondary schools, and a few handfuls of top-level ministry bureaucrats, prosecutors, and army brass, are appointed by ministers. Another power the president can and does delegate to ministers is the right to conclude international treaties. = Council of Ministers = While every minister is a one-person supreme executive organ within his or her designated topic area, there are several types of decisions with respect to which the supreme executive organ is the cabinet as a whole. Exercising the powers vested in the cabinet requires a formal resolution passed in a formal plenary session; the quorum is one half plus one of the ministers. Informally, the body of ministers meeting to discharge the collective responsibilities of the cabinet is often called the Council of Ministers (). The term is colloquial; it does not appear in the constitution. Legally, a session of the Council of Ministers () is simply a session of the cabinet ().  Eligibility  Prospective ministers must be eligible for election to the National Council. In essence, this means they need to be Austrian nationals, need to be at least 18 years of age, and cannot have lost the right to stand as a candidate as a result of a criminal conviction. Generally speaking, Austria does not strip convicts of either the right to vote or the right to run, but criminal courts may pronounce a defendant temporarily disqualified if the defendant * has been sentenced to a jail term of at least one year for treason, espionage, terrorism, war crimes, or crimes against humanity, for an attempt to undermine national security, for attempting to blackmail or intimidate justices, legislators, or senior administrators, for attempting to compromise an election or a plebiscite, or for attempting to undermine Austria's neutrality or Austria's foreign relations; * has been sentenced to a jail term of at least five years for some other premeditated act. Parts of the sentence suspended for probation do not count. The disqualification is automatically lifted once the sentence has been served. Ministers are subject to incompatibility rules. The president, a member of the Constitutional Court, Supreme Administrative Court, or Supreme Court of Justice cannot serve as a minister; neither can the president of the Court of Auditors. There are no rules against legislators being ministers. Ministers cannot hold for-profit, private-sector employment, although they may be exempt from this provision by the National Council's Incompatibility Committee () if the committee is satisfied there is no conflict of interest. Ministers may hold honorary positions but have to report them to the committee. Ministers may hold stakes in for-profit companies, but any such stakes too have to be reported; if a minister and his or her spouse jointly control more than 25% of a corporation, that corporation is automatically excluded from public procurement.  Appointment  Thomas Drozda being appointed minister by President Heinz Fischer, a former minister himself Ministers are appointed by the president. The chancellor is appointed by the president unilaterally; ministers other than the chancellor are appointed on nomination by the chancellor. In theory, the president can also dismiss ministers: the chancellor can be removed unilaterally; individual ministers other than the chancellor can only be removed on request by the chancellor. The president can also remove, again unilaterally, the entire cabinet at once. In practice, the president does not forcibly dismiss either ministers or cabinets; they resign. The fact that the cabinet is installed by the president, who is elected directly by the people, and not by parliament is one of the features of the Austrian constitution that impart a semi-presidential appearance to the country. The appearance is superficial; as a matter of political reality, Austria is a parliamentary republic. The main reason is that ministers are politically answerable not only to the president but to the legislature as well. The president is required to dismiss any minister the National Council censures with a motion of no confidence. The National Council can also order to president to dismiss the entire cabinet. As a result, the president is more or less forced to appoint as chancellor whichever majority leader the legislature preselects. Austrian presidents gladly accept that their role is that of figureheads. The last time an Austrian president rebuked a parliamentary majority leader was in the context of the installation of the first Sch√ºssel government in 1999; President Thomas Klestil first preemptively announced he would refuse to appoint J√∂rg Haider, then in fact refused Chancellor Wolfgang Sch√ºssel's request to appoint Hilmar Kabas and Thomas Prinzhorn. Even so, motions of no confidence are extremely common; they just never pass. Between 1945 and 2005, opposition parties have submitted no fewer 175 unsuccessful motions of no confidence in order to focus attention and create headlines. There were 65 motions of no confidence in the ten years from 2006 to 2016, i.e. more than six per year. As of 2017, motions of no confidence have been introduced against members of every single cabinet in the history of the Second Austrian Republic. Unable to govern effectively without active majority support in the legislature, and in fact unable to stay in office without at least its tacit toleration, the cabinet derives not just its actual authority but also its abstract political legitimacy from the National Council. It is thus customary for the cabinet to resign not just when the ruling coalition breaks down but also whenever a new National Council is elected. The constitution requires the president to put caretaker ministers in charge of the positions being vacated (\\"\\") to prevent disruption of daily operational management of the bureaucracy. In theory, the president could appoint selected departing ministers, state secretaries, or senior civil servants. In practice, the president simply offers to reappoint each minister to the office he or she has just left, the ministers accept; the caretaker government is identical to the conventional government preceding it.  Impeachment  In addition to being politically answerable to the president and the legislature, ministers are also legally liable for any misconduct in office. The constitution stipulates that Austria is run according to the principle of the rule of law (). Among other things, this means that it is illegal for ministers to try to exercise powers not explicitly vested in them by statute. Ministers accused of not just political malpractice but of culpable violations of actual law can be impeached before the Constitutional Court. If the court finds the minister guilty, the minister is removed from office. In certain minor cases, the Court can limit itself to merely noting the violation. In extreme cases, the court can strip the defendant of their political rights, although only for a limited term; this would prevent the defendant from holding either a ministry or any other political office for a while.  Special cases  Bruno Kreisky was a minister for almost twenty years, thirteen of them as the chancellor = Chancellor = The chancellor is the head of government and is set apart from other ministers in several ways: * The chancellor chairs the sessions of the cabinet. * The chancellor is the first minister of any new cabinet to be appointed and represents the cabinet vis-a-vis the president. Ministers other than the chancellor can only be appointed on nomination by the chancellor. The president also needs the chancellor's active cooperation to a minister other than the chancellor. * The chancellor directs the promulgation of parliamentary resolutions, particularly statutes, and of verdicts of the Constitutional Court abrogating statutes. The chancellor is the officer who formally presents bills to be signed into law to the president, and the president's signature only becomes effective with the chancellor's countersignature. * If the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his or her office, the chancellor takes over as acting president for a period of up to twenty days. One power the chancellor notably does not have is , the power to issue directives or policy guidelines to other ministers. On paper, this means that the chancellor is a mere primus inter pares. In reality, the chancellor's triple role as chairperson of the cabinet, coadjutor of the president, and parliamentary majority leader makes him or her the most powerful person in Austrian politics by a comfortable margin. The ministry the chancellor leads is the Chancellery, the only ministry the constitution actually guarantees to exist. = Vice chancellor = The vice chancellor stands in for the chancellor whenever the chancellor is unavailable. No special resolution or proclamation is necessary for the vice chancellor to become acting chancellor; the vice chancellor simply takes charge wherever expediency requires. If a cabinet session has been scheduled and the chancellor is unable to attend, for instance, the vice chancellor is permitted, and in fact expected, to chair the meeting in the chancellor's stead. In a coalition government, the vice chancellor is usually the leader of the junior coalition party. Ministers belonging to the vice chancellor's party will look to the vice chancellor, not the chancellor, for leadership. The result is that vice chancellors, like chancellors, are more influential in reality than a literal reading of the constitution would suggest. The constitution permits the vice chancellor to be given, in addition to his or her role as the deputy head of the Chancellery, a ministry of his or her own; alternatively, the vice chancellor can be given full autonomous control of a specific Chancellery subdepartment. Since the duties of a vice chancellor by themselves are not particularly taxing, vice chancellors are generally happy to avail themselves of the opportunity. Heinz-Christian Strache for example, vice chancellor in the First Kurz government, doubles as the Chancellery minister of Civil Service and Sports. = Ministers without portfolio = Gernot Bl√ºmel, a minister without portfolio and later Chancellery minister in the First Kurz government The constitution does not require that every minister be put in charge of a ministry; president and chancellor are free to install ministers without portfolio. Ministers without portfolio are not a regular occurrence today, but the option is occasionally useful because most Austrian governments are coalition governments; there has not been a single- party cabinet since 1971. The size of a coalition government does not always depend on the number of available ministries alone. In many governments, the relative strengths of the two parties in the National Council call for a seat ratio in the cabinet that is difficult to approximate with the ministries at hand; a supernumerary minister or two can help reach the necessary compromise. Another factor is that different parties cater to different constituencies and therefore demand different areas of responsibility, meaning that the division of responsibilities into portfolios () is highly political. As a consequence, responsibilities keep being shuffled around; ministries are created, dissolved, merged into others, or split in two ‚Äì usually once per election cycle, sometimes twice or more. A minister designated to lead a ministry that does not yet exist can be made a minister without portfolio for the time being. A typical but notable example is Herta Firnberg, a member of the first Kreisky government. Kreisky had decided to create a Ministry of Women's Affairs. Since creating a new ministry requires a statute to be enacted and promulgated, several weeks would pass between Kreisky taking office and the ministry becoming available. The designated minister ‚Äì Firnberg ‚Äì was made a minister without portfolio for the duration of the transitional period. = Chancellery ministers = Instead of a ministry, ministers can also be put in charge of a section () of the Chancellery, the ministry led by the chancellor. Ministers leading Chancellery sections are commonly called \\"ministers in the Chancellery\\" (\\"\\") or \\"Chancellery ministers\\" (\\"\\") for short, although neither expression appears in the constitution. The difference between ministers leading ministries and ministers leading Chancellery sections is mostly aesthetic. One the one hand, being the head of a ministry is obviously more prestigious than being the head of merely part of one. A second factor is that Chancellery sections, unlike ministries, can be created or dissolved without involving the legislature and so tend to be naturally more ephemeral. As a result, Chancellery ministers can be considered politically junior to regular ministers. On the other hand, Chancellery ministers are supreme executive organs within their respective domains just like regular ministers. Even though the chancellor can create Chancellery sections without having to wait for statutes to be passed and promulgated, the process can take time. As a result, Chancellery ministers too sometimes start their tenures in the cabinet as ministers without portfolio. As of September 2018, the most recent example is Gernot Bl√ºmel, minister of European affairs, the Art, Culture and the Media in the First Kurz government. Bl√ºmel was first sworn in as a minister without portfolio on December 18, 2017, then sworn in again as a Chancellery minister on January 8, 2018.

An adaptation of the 1988 film of the same name and a reboot of the Child's Play franchise, it follows a family terrorized by a high-tech doll who becomes self-aware and subsequently murderous. The film stars Aubrey Plaza, Gabriel Bateman, Brian Tyree Henry, Tim Matheson, David Lewis and Mark Hamill as the voice of Chucky. It is an international co- production of the United States and Canada. The development of a Child's Play remake was announced in July 2018. Klevberg signed on as director from a script by Burton Smith, saying in an interview he drew inspiration from the 1982 science fiction film, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Principal photography lasted from September to November 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Child's Play was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2019, by Orion Pictures through United Artists Releasing. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $44 million worldwide against a $10 million budget. Plot The international Kaslan Corporation has just launched Buddi, a revolutionary line of high-tech dolls designed to be life-long companions to their owners, learning from their surroundings, and acting accordingly, quickly becoming a success for children worldwide. At a Buddi doll assembly plant in Vietnam, an employee is fired by his superintendent for daydreaming at work. In retaliation, the employee manipulates the Buddi doll that he is assembling by disabling all of its safety protocols, before committing suicide by falling from the top of the factory and landing on a car. The doll is packaged alongside others in preparation for delivery to toy stores worldwide. In Chicago, Illinois, retail clerk Karen Barclay (Plaza) and her 13-year-old hearing-impaired son Andy, have moved into their new apartment. In an attempt to cheer Andy up and make up for the unease caused by the relocation and her new boyfriend Shane, Karen blackmails her boss, Wes, in order to procure the defective Buddi doll, giving it to Andy as an early birthday gift. Once Andy activates the doll, he names himself \\"Chucky\\" and becomes attached to his owner. Over time, Chucky helps Andy befriend two other kids in the building ‚Äî Falyn and Pugg ‚Äî but also begin to display violent tendencies. For instance, he tries to strangle the Barclays' pet cat after it scratches Andy, and one night, while he and his friends gleefully watch a horror film, Chucky starts mimicking the violence on the screen and approaches the trio with a kitchen knife before Andy disarms him. The next morning, Andy arrives home to find that his cat is dead; Chucky admits to having killed it so that it would not hurt Andy anymore. Karen locks the doll in a closet, but he escapes and terrorizes Shane, which leads him to confront Andy. After overhearing Andy's pleas for Shane to be gone, Chucky follows him home, where it is revealed that Shane has a family and has been having an affair with Karen behind his wife's back. While Shane is outside taking down Christmas lights, Chucky breaks his legs and activates a tiller that scalps and kills him. The following day, Chucky delivers Shane's skinned face as a gift to a horrified Andy. While police detective Mike Norris and his partner Willis begin an investigation, Andy, Falyn, and Pugg disable Chucky and throw him in the garbage. Building voyeur and electrician Gabe finds the doll and takes him to the basement to prepare him for an online sale. Now fully repaired, Chucky tortures and murders Gabe with a table saw. After making his way back to the ground level, Chucky lands in possession of another kid identified Omar and proceeds to kill Norris' mother, Doreen, in a controlled car crash. Meanwhile, Andy fails to convince Karen that the doll has become murderous, and she takes Andy along to her next shift of work at the local shopping mall to keep him nearby. Suspecting that Andy is the killer, Norris travels to the mall and apprehends him just as Chucky takes full control of the building. Chaos is unleashed as several employees and customers are brutally killed by rampaging Buddi dolls while Chucky triggers the mall's lockdown sequence. Amid the massacre, Wes is murdered, Norris is wounded, and Andy and his friends manage to reach the exit, only for Andy to be forced to return when Chucky reveals that he is holding Karen hostage, intending to kill her. Andy manages to free his mother while being attacked by Chucky, before stabbing the doll in his power cell, deactivating him. While paramedics tend to Karen, Norris, and other survivors outside the mall, the kids destroy and burn Chucky's body in a nearby alleyway. In the consequence of Chucky's killing spree, Kaslan Corporation CEO Henry Kaslan issues a statement regarding Chucky's programming, announcing a massive Buddi dolls recall. As one of the dolls is being placed into storage, its eyes flicker red and the doll smiles, revealing that Chucky transferred his artificial intelligence awareness into a new doll.

Lars Klevberg signed on as director, with a script by Tyler Burton Smith (of Polaroid and Quantum Break fame, respectively). It and It Chapter Two collaborative team Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg served as producers. In September 2018, Gabriel Bateman, Aubrey Plaza, and Brian Tyree Henry were set to star. In November 2018, Ty Consiglio and Beatrice Kitsos joined the cast. Principal photography began on September 17 and wrapped on November 8, 2018, in Vancouver, Canada. Reshoots occurred on December 15‚Äì16 and in April 2019. MastersFX, a visual effects company, took six weeks to prepare and assemble seven practical animatronic puppets, each with interchangeable arms and heads that performed a variety of required actions on set, with some help from Pixomondo, who provided the CGI for the film. In March 2019, actor Mark Hamill announced that he joined the cast to voice Chucky in the film. Grahame-Smith elaborated on Hamill's casting in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying: Bear McCreary composed the score through a \\"toy orchestra\\" inspired by \\"Chucky's toy-store origins\\" with toy pianos, hurdy-gurdies, accordions, plastic guitars and otamatones. The soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records on vinyl which featured liner notes by the composer. Marketing The first official image of Chucky was released on September 21, 2018. The teaser poster was released on November 12, 2018, revealing that for the film's adaptation the Good Guys dolls would be called Buddi, referencing the My Buddy doll that influenced the original character's design. A WiFi symbol over the \\"i\\" in \\"Buddi\\" teases the character's hi-tech functions, being similar to robot toys, such as Furby and RoboSapien. Orion Pictures launched a marketing website for the fictional Kaslan Corporation, ahead of the film's release. The first trailer premiered on February 8, 2019, with the release of The Prodigy. The film's theatrical poster was released on April 17, 2019 and the second trailer on April 18, 2019. On May 16, 2019, a behind-the-scenes video was uploaded to Orion Pictures' YouTube channel, which shows how Chucky was brought to life for the film. Beginning April 2019, several posters alluding to Toy Story 4 were released, featuring Chucky brutally killing characters of the animated franchise, using the Toy Story 4's teaser posters' background. Both films had June 21, 2019 releases. On June 24, a poster was unveiled to coincide with the impending release of Annabelle Comes Home, altering one of that film's posters to imply Chucky's attack on the Annabelle doll. Release =Theatrical= The film was released in the United States on June 21, 2019. It is the first film from Orion Pictures to be released through United Artists Releasing. =Home media= The film was released digitally on September 10, 2019 and on Blu-ray and DVD on September 24, 2019 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Reception =Box office= Child's Play grossed $29.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $15.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $44.9 million, against a production budget of $10 million. In the United States and Canada, Child's Play was released alongside Toy Story 4 and Anna, and was projected to gross $16‚Äì18 million from 3,007 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $6.1 million on its first day, including $1.65 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $14.1 million, and finishing second, behind Toy Story 4. The film dropped 68.6% in its second weekend to $4.4 million, falling to eighth. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63% based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 5.78/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Child's Play updates an '80s horror icon for the Internet of Things era, with predictably gruesome ‚Äì and generally entertaining ‚Äì results.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest score of the series. Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \\"nastier, more playful, and just as good if not better than the original film.\\" Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film a positive review, with 4/5 stars, calling it a \\"Chilrazor-sharp and exquisitely gruesome toy story\\". Jeremy Dick from MovieWeb also liked the film, writing \\"Child's Play is the perfect horror movie remake and should now serve as a prime example of what others should do. It's highly entertaining and tons of fun, and I say that as a huge fan of the original.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"MIA is the original's perverse originality... in a misguided satire of the digital era and millennial consumerism\\". Varietys Peter Debruge was also negative, stating, \\"This is the new normal for horror movies: The screenplays have to seem hipper than the premise they represent, which puts Child's Play in the weird position of pointing out and poking fun at all the ways it fails to make sense.\\" Future At WonderCon, Grahame-Smith said that if the film does well, they would love to make a sequel. Director Lars Klevberg discussed his ideas for a possible sequel: \\"For me, this was just trying to make this the best movie possible. Like, never foreshadowing any detailed plan of where you want to go as a franchise. But yeah, for me I think I love the Buddi bear concept.\\" References External links   * Category:2019 films Category:2010s satirical films Category:2019 horror films Category:American films Category:American film remakes Category:American satirical films Category:American serial killer films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:American slasher films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian satirical films Category:Child's Play (franchise) films Category:English-language films Category:Films about artificial intelligence Category:Films about toys Category:Adultery in films Category:Films set in 2019 Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in Vietnam Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:Horror film remakes Category:Orion Pictures films Category:Films scored by Bear McCreary ","title":"Child's Play (2019 film)"},{"id":"58537894","text":"Llandrindod East/Llandrindod West (commonly Llandrindod East/West) is the name of an electoral ward in the town of Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales.

According to Greek mythology, it was said to have been founded by Letreus, a son of Pelops. There was a tradition that said that the bones of Pelops - necessary, according to the oracle, for the Achaeans to conquer Troy - were at Letrini.Lycophron, Alexandra, 53-55. Together with several of the other dependent townships of Elis, it joined Spartan king Agis II, when he invaded the territories of Elis; and the Eleians were obliged to surrender their supremacy over Letrini by the peace which they concluded with the Spartans in 400 BCE. Later, the townsmen of Letrini formed part of the Spartan army that fought at the Battle of Nemea in 394 BCE. Xenophon speaks of Letrini, Amphidoli, and Marganeis as Triphylian places, although they were on the right bank of the Alpheius; and if there is no corruption in the text, the word Triphylian must be used in a loose sense to signify the dependent townships of Elis. The ŒõŒµœÑœÅŒπŒΩŒ±·øñŒ±Œπ Œ≥œçŒ±Œπ are mentioned by Lycophron.Lycophron, Alexandra, 158.. In the time of Pausanias nothing remained of Letrini except a few houses and a temple of Artemis Alpheiaea; the epithet Alpheiaea was due to a tradition that the river god Alpheus fell in love with Artemis and tried to seduce her in the vicinity of Letrini. It remains doubtful whether this temple is the same as that mentioned by Strabo as located near the mouth of the Alpheius. Letrini may be placed at the village and monastery of Agios Ioannis (St John), between Pyrgos and the port of Katakolo, where, according to William Martin Leake, among many fragments of antiquity, a part of a large statue was found in the early 19th century.Leake, Morea, vol. ii. p. 188.

He was both a correspondent member of the Mathematics section (specializing in probability theory and mathematical physics) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and a professor in the Department of Mathematical Physics and Computational Mathematics at the National University of Kharkiv. Biography Chueshov was born in Leningrad on 23 September 1951. He started his higher education at the School of Mechanics and Mathematics at the National University of Kharkov in 1968. He graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mathematics in 1973. In 1977,Igor D. Chueshov. Mathematics Genealogy Project http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=73609 he earned a Candidate of Sciences, an equivalent to a Ph.D. Chueshov earned a Doctorate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1990 with his dissertation, \\"Mathematical Description of the Non-regular Dynamics of the Elastic Shell\\". Upon graduation, he joined Kharkiv University's department of Mechanics and Mathematics. Chueshov became Professor of the Department of Mathematical Physics and Computational Mathematics in 1992. In February 2000, he was named the head of the department. In February 2009, Chueshov was elected as one of the Correspondent Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine for the Section of Mathematics, specializing in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics. He was also a laureate of the State Prize of Ukraine in the field of science and technology, which he received in 2010. He remained at the Mechanics and Mathematics department of Kharkiv University, living with his wife Galina and two sons, Constantin (born in 1979) and Gennadiy (born in 1983), both born in California, until his death on 23 April 2016 from acute leukemia.  Research  Chueshov authored a number of papers in the field of fundamental mathematics. He made significant contributions to mathematical physics and influenced the development of modern infinite-dimensional dynamical systems theory.I.D. Chueshov, (1999), Introduction to the Theory of Infinite-Dimensional Dissipative Systems. Acta, Kharkov (Russian); English translation: Acta, Kharkov, 2002; see also http://www.emis.de/monographs/Chueshov/ He solved a number of important problems associated with non-linear partial differential equations that arise in mechanics and physics, initiating the development of several areas in the qualitative theory of dissipative systems. Chueshov's investigations were related to the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of the evolutionary von Karman equations, describing nonlinear oscillations of a thin elastic shell under the influence of non-conservative loads. One of Chueshov's theorems provided a solution to a well-known problem posed by I.V. Vorovich in the 1950s. The results became an essential step in understanding the structure of attractors for dynamical systems. Chueshov was also a pioneer in the field of nonlinear fluid-structure interactions models, especially those arising in aeroelasticity (for instance, the nonlinear model of a fluttering [link here] panel studied by Earl Dowell). Chueshov succeeded in developing a new effective method for the analysis of general infinite-dimensional dissipative systems generated by non-linear second-order in time equations. Quasi- stability allows one to resolve many important questions that arise in the hyperbolic dynamics with nonlinear internal or boundary dissipation, relying only on a single estimate. Chueshov also obtained important results on the uniqueness of invariant measures for stochastic perturbations of the three- dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in thin regions. The results provided a fundamental opportunity to use methods of two-dimensional stochastic hydrodynamics to describe the phenomenon of turbulence in some three- dimensional systems. Igor Dmitrievich was one of the founders of the theory of monotone stochastic dynamical systems. Together with Professor L. Arnold, he obtained fundamental results on the structure of random attractors, and introduced the important concept of the semi-equilibrium state of a monotone stochastic system. These results became the basis of the only monograph on monotonous stochastic dynamic systems, published by Springer in 2002.

In the former Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines, it was a prefectural shrine of Fukui Prefecture. Noted for its mossy gardens, the shrine gardens were designated a national Place of Scenic Beauty (ÂêçÂãù) in 1930 and a National Historic Site of Japan in 1935. Its main festival is held annually on April 20. The area is part of Hakusan National Park. History A Tendai sect Buddhist temple, Heisen-ji, was founded in 717 AD by the Japanese Shugend≈ç monk Taich≈ç, who is said to have been the first person to ascend the sacred mountain Hakusan (2,702m)Taich≈ç Kash≈ç Denki . Katsuyama Ky≈çdoshi Kenky≈´kai. Accessed November 17, 2010. It became a centre for mountain worship involving amalgamation of beliefs, philosophies, doctrines and ritual systems drawn from local folk-religious practices, pre-Buddhist mountain worship, Shinto, Taoism and Vajrayana an ascetic practices involving climbing the mountain by various routes. The temple was mentioned in the Heike monogatari, and was the site of the 1183 Battle of Kurikara during the Genpei War between Kiso Yoshinaka and the Taira clan. The temple was destroyed in 1338 by the forces of Shiba Takatsune for its support of the Southern Court of Emperor Go-Daigo during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period and again in 1440. It was rebuilt with the support of the Muromachi shogunate, who levied a special tax on the seven provinces of the Hokuriku region for its reconstruction. As a result, the temple expanded to a powerful religious city consisting of 48 shrines and 36 temples, along with an urban complex of over 6000 living quarters for priests or shrine personnel. The temple precincts governed a domain yielding revenues of 90,000 koku, giving it a kokudaka which rivalled that of a daimy≈ç, an edit could field an army of 8000 s≈çhei warrior-monks. However, the whole temple was destroyed again in 1574 by Asakura Kageaki during the Echizen Ikk≈ç-ikki uprising. Despite subsequent effort of reconstruction, the temple precincts were reduced to less than one tenth its former area, and its kokudaka was reduced to 330 koku; many ruins of temples were buried under forests and fields. Due to the Ordinance Distinguishing Shinto and Buddhism issued at the beginning of Meiji Period, the temple abandoned Buddhism and became a Shinto shrine.

His artworks have been exhibited nationally and internationally, during his lifetime and to this day, with his artwork being well represented in the National Museum of Damascus. For one of the exhibitions at the museum honoring Mahmoud Jalal in 1993, the late critic and the then director of the Directorate of Fine Arts of Damascus, Tariq al- Sharif, spoke of Jalal's contribution as an artist, as well as an ‚Äúeducator of generations of artists, and a distinct personality within our artistic movement.‚Äù In another article, Tariq al-Sharif described Jalal as a ‚Äúleading artist of the art movement in Syria‚Äù, and shared of Jalal's struggle to elevate the artistic movement and how he ‚Äúremained faithful to his principles until the end.‚Äù = Education = As a young man, in 1935, Mahmoud Jalal was accepted to study painting at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma, while at the same time he took sculpture courses at the San Jacomo Institute in Rome, Italy.

Due to the Great Migration happening around this time, more African Americans were moving to Harlem; however, many of the theaters in Harlem were segregated or completely closed to black audiences. Downs made the Lincoln into a theater for black people, hosting black shows and black performers, then had the current Lincoln Theatre building constructed in 1915.

Design The SWCS is longer and taller than its predecessor, the Mark 8 SDV. The SWCS will have a longer range and higher payload capacity than its predecessor. As such, it will also be about heavier than its predecessor. Its hull is made from aluminium. The SWCS will also have more advanced computer systems and better navigation, with new systems including a \\"sensor mast\\" with an electro-optical periscope, wireless and wired communication between crew members, sonar detectors, and sonar-assisted automatic docking. The computer bus and sensor mast are designed as modular systems so that individual sensors or systems can be swapped out as required by an individual mission and upgraded as desired. Like its predecessor, the SWCS will carry six SEALs: a pilot, a co-pilot/navigator, and four passengers. The SWCS can be deployed from surface ships, land, and Dry Deck Shelters (DDS) on submarines, although the third option is preferred for stealth reasons. Compared to the DCS it will serve alongside, the SWCS will be able to enter areas that the DCS cannot. It will also be deployable from submarines, a capability that the DCS lacked as of 2015. The SWCS's larger dimensions will require expanding the DDS to accommodate it. The Navy plans to lengthen the DDS by and triple its weight capacity.

The tournament is based on the Lucha Libre Parejas Incre√≠bles match concept, which pairs two wrestlers of opposite allegiance, one portraying a villain, referred to as a \\"rudo\\" in Lucha Libre wrestling terminology, and one portraying a fan favorites, or \\"t√©cnico\\". The 2018 version of the tournament was the ninth time in a row that CMLL held the tournament since the first tournament in 2010. The winners are presented with a trophy but not given any other tangible reward for the victory. The finals were originally scheduled to take place on Friday, February 16, 2018, but due to an earthquake hitting Mexico City on that day the show was canceled while the building was inspected for structural damage. The finals took place on March 23 instead. The 16-team tournament was won by the team of Rush and El Terrible, who had been long-time rivals from 2011 to 2013, and had previously teamed up for the 2012, 2013 and 2017 tournaments. The duo defeated Volador Jr. and √öltimo Guerrero in the finals of the three- week tournament. After the tournament El Terrible joined Rush's group called Los Ingobernables and together they won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship History Rush, the tecnico winner of the 2018 tournament. The Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; \\"World Wrestling Council\\") held their first Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles (\\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\\") in 2010, from January 22 through February 5, marking the beginning of an annual tournament. CMLL has previous held Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments on an irregular basis and often promoted individual Parejas Incre√≠bles and Relevos Incre√≠bles (\\"Incredible Relay\\", with teams of three or more wrestlers). The Parejas Incre√≠bles concept is a long- standing tradition in lucha libre and is at times referred to as a \\"strange bedfellows\\" match in English speaking countries, because a Pareja Increible consists of a face (referred to as a t√©cnico in Lucha Libre, or a \\"good guy\\") and a heel (a rudo, those that portray \\"the bad guys\\") teamed up for a specific match, or in this case for a tournament. The 2018 tournament was the ninth annual Parejas Incre√≠bles tournament, and like its predecessors held as part of CMLL's regular Friday night CMLL Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows. Tournament The tournament featured 15 professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers teaming up, some of whom were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines while others were simply paired up for the tournament. For the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments, CMLL often teamed up a t√©cnico (those that portray the \\"good guys\\" in wrestling, also known as faces) and a rudo (the \\"bad guy\\" or heels) who are involved in a pre-existing storyline feud at the time of the tournament so that the tournament itself can be used as a storytelling device to help tell the story of escalating confrontations between two feuding wrestlers. The tournament format followed CMLL's traditional tournament formats, with two qualifying blocks of eight teams that competed during the first and second week of the tournament and a final match between the two block winners. The qualifying blocks were all one-fall matches while the tournament final was a best two- out-of-three-falls tag team match. =Tournament participants= ;Block A *√Ångel de Oro and El Cuatrero *Atlantis and Mr. Niebla *Blue Panther Jr. and M√°scara A√±o 2000 *Car√≠stico and Euforia *Marco Corleone and Shocker *Dragon Lee and Sans√≥n *Rush and El Terrible *Stuka Jr. and Forastero ;Block B *Blue Panther and Sam Adonis *Diamante Azul and Comandante Pierroth *M√≠stico and Mephisto *Niebla Roja and Gran Guerrero *Soberano Jr. and Hechicero *Tit√°n and B√°rbaro Cavernario *Valiente and Rey Bucanero *Volador Jr. and √öltimo Guerrero =Ongoing storylines= The team of Rush and El Terrible had teamed together in two previous Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments, both as part of a long, heated storyline feud between the two that ran from 2011 through 2012.

The two were able to work together well enough to make it to the finals of the tournament but lost to Atlantis and Euforia in the finals when they were unable to get along. After the loss Rush made a Lucha de Apuestas challenge to El Terrible. The storyline culminated on September 14 in the main event of CMLL's 79th Anniversary Show, where El Terrible lost and as a result, shaved bald. In March, 2013 El Terrible and Rush teamed up for the 2013 Torneo de Parejas Incre√≠bles and were teamed up again for the 2017 Torneo de Parejas Incre√≠bles unsuccessfully as they were eliminated Atlantis and Euforia in the second round. =Tournament brackets= =Tournament shows= February 2, 2018 February 9, 2018 February 23, 2018 Aftermath After the victory both Rush invited El Terrible to join Los Ingobernables, an offer El Terrible immediately accepted, joining forces with Rush and El Bestia del Ring.

Madsen (1989), Joseph Smith the Prophet, pp. 107‚Äì108, and (2004) Presidents of the Church, Deseret Book, Salt Lake City ‚Äì Predominantly via matriarchal lines, Stillman Pond was a sixth-generation direct descendant of the Reverend John Lathrop (1584‚Äì1653) ‚Äì the stoic 17th- century separatist minister from England (and a contemporary of Shakespeare) who for his determined faith endured inhumane persecution and imprisonment by Archbishop William Laud of London, but who fled to America to achieve religious freedom for his family and followers. Lathrop fathered a most distinguished and impressive American progeny ‚Äì that is to say, he stands preeminent among the ancestors of the Prophet Joseph Smith himself (Lathrop is Smith's fifth great-grandfather), Hyrum Smith (and Hyrum's own LDS Prophet- progeny of Joseph F. and Joseph Fielding Smith); several U.S. Presidents, including U.S. Grant, FDR, and the Bushes; LDS Church leaders Wilford Woodruff, Frederick G. Williams, Oliver Cowdery, Orson and Parley P. Pratt, W. W. Phelps, Orson F. Whitney, Zina Huntington Young (Smith), George Albert Smith, Harold B. Lee, Spencer W. Kimball, Ezra Taft Benson, Gordon B.

Covey, Hyrum Smith (Franklin Quest/Franklin Covey founder), and a great swath of other American historical, cultural, and literary figures, such as poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, romantic novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, chief justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, banker J. P. Morgan and investor Henry Sturgis Morgan, educator Benjamin Spock, inventor Eli Whitney, actors Clint Eastwood and John Lithgow, and fiction writer Orson Scott Card. John Lathrop's story is that of a highly principled religious reformer and tireless community and nation builder, whose many descendants have strongly influenced the development of American government, law, medicine, science, industry, culture, and religion. The Massachusetts native was born only two years before the birth of the prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., with whom he shared a common ancestry (in separatist minister John Lathrop, 1584‚Äì1653) and whose fledgling American religion he would one day embrace. While Stillman's paternal grandfather, Joseph Pond (b. 1756) was a Revolutionary War soldier, his great-great-grandfather Ezra Pond (b. 1692) was a restless, dissatisfied pastor of a local Franklin, Massachusetts congregation. In the Puritan spirit of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, Ezra refused to comply with the orders of the community elders, and he was forced to leave town, moving with his family to Hubbardston. Stillman's maternal great-great-grandfather was Lt. Paul Moore (b. 1711), an American army commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Perhaps because of the firebrand nature of his religious heritage, a passionate, restless strain of spiritual fervor seemed to course, as it were, through Stillman's veins.Pond, Leon Y. & H. Ray Pond, Stillman Pond, a Biographical Sketch, ed., Sterling Forsyth, Histories, LDS Historical Department, Salt Lake City. It was this spirit that later would move him, in the autumn of 1843, to commit his growing family to making an arduous trek across five states to a burgeoning new city on the Mississippi ‚Äì Nauvoo, Illinois ‚Äì where they might join with the relentlessly driven body of Latter-day Saints there assembling. Stillman himself ‚Äì a farmer, harnessmaker, and land speculator by trade ‚Äì was ever thrifty and industrious from the days of his youth, always ensuring that he sold at a profit. Marrying in 1825 one Almyra Whittemore, he removed to Westminster, Worcester, Massachusetts, where he purchased several tracts of land. There he remained until 1832, when he moved to Templeton. Almyra bore him 5 children (four girls and one boy), but at age 33 she died in the yellow fever epidemic that swept through New England in 1833 and was buried at Hubbardston.Single- story red brick home of Lorin Farr, a Pond family neighbor, on Durphy Street (south of Wilford Woodruff's home), block 106, Nauvoo, Illinois.  Mormon convert and polygamist  A young widower now with five children, Stillman Pond would ultimately marry five times and produce a multitudinous posterity. Marrying again for the first time in 1834, to one Maria Louisa Davis, Stillman settled again at Hubbardston, but moved his family in 1837 to New Salem, Massachusetts, purchasing there three tracts of land over the next five years. There, he and his family fostered new friendships, including with the Haskell family (later reuniting with them at Nauvoo).Haskell, 'Letters of a Proselyte: The Hascall-Pomeroy Correspondence' (letters of Irene Haskell Pomeroy and her mother Ursula B. Haskell, 1845‚Äì1854), Utah Historical Quarterly 25, four quarterly installments (Jan‚ÄìOct 1957). Most significantly, it was at New Salem in 1841 that Stillman and his family welcomed into their home traveling Mormon missionaries and were converted, through their efforts, to the new faith that Smith had founded a decade earlier. The family was baptized on December 28, 1841 under the hand of Elder Elias Harris. The Mormon message, which afforded hope for his loved ones, both living and dead, filled Stillman's troubled soul with great comfort and peace. Able to sell his land in order to join the Missouri-driven Latter-day Saints at Nauvoo, Illinois, Stillman and his family, having embraced 'the New Covenant,' made their trek in the fall of 1843.Heber C. Kimball home, on the corner of Partridge & Munson Streets, just west of the site of the Stillman Pond store and residence, Nauvoo, Illinois.  Nauvoo merchant, Elder and Seventy  In the would-be refuge of the 'City Beautiful' Stillman built a two-story red brick home (in the front part of which he established a store) a few blocks southwest of the Nauvoo Temple on Munson Street (block 106) ‚Äì equidistant at points east and north from the banks of the mighty Mississippi, which forms the city's southern and western borders.

Waterford, Vermont native Lorin Farr (1820‚Äì1909) was a bodyguard-scribe to the Prophet Joseph Smith and, later, father-in-law to Apostle and First Presidency member John Henry Smith, and the maternal grandfather of LDS Church President George Albert Smith. After the arrival of the Latter-day Saints in Utah, Farr became the first mayor of Ogden City. Farr's sister Diantha was married to the Prophet's clerk and Council of Fifty member William Clayton, who, as a clerk also to Brigham Young, went West when he did. Diantha was expecting and stayed at Nauvoo until after her baby was born; when word reached William in Iowa that Diantha had born a healthy baby, he penned words to a hymn for the Mormon people called 'Come, Come Ye Saints.' but also just east of the historic red- brick residence of Mormon Apostle Heber C.

Ordained an Elder of the church in July 1844 (only weeks after the Prophet Joseph's martyrdom), Stillman received his patriarchal blessing under the hands of the Prophet's uncle, John Smith, on January 1, 1845, and that same year (17 May) became a member of the church's 2nd Quorum of Seventy, receiving also with his wife (and his first wife by proxy) the ordinance of the holy Endowment in the still unfinished Nauvoo Temple on December 30. Stillman, on February 12, 1846, wrote: 'I am perfectly satisfied with the authorities of the Church and consider it my indispensable duty to give heed to all things.'Pond, Leon Y. & H. Ray Pond, Stillman Pond. The LDS song 'Follow the Prophet,' written for Mormon Primary children in 1989 by musician-composer and scriptwriter Duane E. Hiatt, was based on Stillman Pond's story of faithful adherence to the counsel of him whom Latter Day Saints regard as God's living mouthpiece on earth.

More than three hundred are at work on it and the rest help by paying their tything [sic] &c.; The Nauvoo House goes on too ... I delayed writing on account of the trial of the murderers at Carthage. It is thought the murderers are at liberty ... We expect the Temple will have to be completed with a sword in one hand and tool in the other [6/2/1845] ... The Temple progresses finely. The roof is nearly shingled. The framework of the Steeple is nearly as high from the roof up as the body of the Temple. They expect to commence the endowment this fall [July 27, 1845] ...

But they manage also to reflect the courage and fortitude of the body of Saints as a whole. Irene and her mother vividly bring to life the trek across the plains and, later, life as it was in the Great Salt Lake Valley. Irene, for her part, and before the flight West, is able to capture the emotional climate in Nauvoo as the Saints feverishly endeavor to finish building a Temple to their God, while also recording ‚Äì often delightfully ‚Äì the minutia of everyday life. The name 'Camp of Israel' (as penned atop letters on pp. 146, 237) is a term that was applied not only to the Mormon Battalion, but also by Brigham Young to the caravan of the Lord's latter-day people, as they found themselves, like ancient Israel, driven anew into the wilderness.

The children are all dead but Elizabeth and Loenza.' Sister Haskell then explained in her letter that the family became ill before arriving at Winter Quarters when Brother Pond paused to earn some money for his family's survival in an unhealthy location, 'a very sickly town' out of the way. 'Lowell died before they arrived, the rest lived to get here and then dropped away one after another.

All of the marked Pond siblings perished over an 8-month period in the unforgiving elements of their harsh environs, including, finally, on May 17, 1847, a grief-stricken Maria herself (who, though weakened by malaria, was ultimately overcome by 'consumption' or tuberculosis).Pond, Stillman Pond, a Biographical Sketch, pp. 4‚Äì5 ‚Äì Two older daughters born to Stillman and his first wife Almyra yet lived: Elizabeth Almira, who was likewise married (as deceased younger sister Abigail had been) to Bishop Whitney; and Loenza Alcena, who soon married Joseph C. Kingsbury (father of future University of Utah President Joseph T. Kingsbury), though she, too, would die of 'consumption' a few short years later, in 1853 ‚Äì Haskell, 'Letters of a Proselyte' (1957), pp. 244, 350 [3/5/1848, August 29, 1853]. Loenza's daughter, Mariah Kingsbury, would be the wife of Apostle Marriner W. Merrill and the mother of Apostle Joseph F. Merrill. And Stillman, once more a widower, unspeakably grieved for each and every one. On too-frequent occasion, moreover, he found himself straddling the threshold of death.Pond, Stillman Pond, a Biographical Sketch, pp. 4‚Äì5 ‚Äì While enroute to Winter Quarters, for example, Stillman, decimated by sickness and 'unable to drive his team from the buckboard, lay upon his stomach in the wagon. Bracing himself with one arm and peering through a knothole in the dashboard he drove his team with his other hand over the dashboard,' thus traversing the last 150 miles of Iowa Territory. But 'the fire of the New Covenant' burned brightly in Stillman's soul, and it was that which, after leaving the Missouri River encampment on June 17, gave him the strength to press on to the mountains of the West, where he knew he would find the Zion that God had prepared for His saints.  Abigail Thorn and a Prophet's mantle  Abigail Thorn Pond (1821‚Äì1904) Stillman's third wife, Abigail Thorn,Haskell, 'Letters of a Proselyte' (1957), p. 253 [7/6/1849]. whom he married at the Endowment House at Salt Lake City in 1849 and by whom he would have 8 additional children, was the abandoned plural spouse of Major Samuel Russell who had, only a year earlier, deserted Abigail and their own newborn infant in preference for the gold fields of California. Stillman had been a member of the same (combined Smoot-Wallace-Russell) 'Camp of Israel' company as the Russells in the trek to Utah (arriving September 25, 1847), and he had since established himself in farming to the west of the city, where he'd witnessed the saving of his locust-infested crops in 1848 by the miraculous arrival of seagulls. For her part, Abigail ‚Äì born into a respected familyAnya Seton (1958). The Winthrop Woman, Houghton-Mifflin, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Abigail Thorn's progenitors were the founding Winthrop family of the Massachusetts Bay Colony through Elizabeth Fones ‚Äì 'The Winthrop Woman' of Anya Seton's celebrated historical novel. Elizabeth (Abigail Thorn's fifth great-grandmother) was Governor John Winthrop's niece, to whom he played guardian. Governor Winthrop's father was Sir Adam Winthrop III (1548‚Äì1623) of England's Groton Manor (who, in turn, was Abigail Thorn's seventh great- grandfather). at Lair, Cayuga, New York, on April 2, 1821 ‚Äì had experienced a powerful conversion to the Mormon faith as a young woman. The same glorious spirit which had so moved her then, had again urged her to join with the Saints at Nauvoo. There, at the age of 22, she received in the spring of 1843 her patriarchal blessing under the hands of Hyrum Smith, the Prophet's brother, just fifteen months before his martyrdom at Carthage. Hyrum blessed her with the gift of dreams and visions by the Holy Ghost (she would also enjoy in her life the gift of tongues and a keen discernment of spirits). Hers was the special privilege of witnessing at Nauvoo on August 8, 1844, as scores of accounts that were recorded at the time attest,Madsen, Truman G. (2004), 'Brigham Young,' The Presidents of the Church, Deseret Book, Salt Lake City, Utah. the transfiguration of Brigham Young, when the mantle and unmistakable voice of the Prophet Joseph Smith fell upon him as a special sign to the Saints of his high calling and acceptance of the Lord to lead His people.  Pioneering at Spanish Fork and Cache Valley  Like Zebedee Coltrin and other Saints who preceded them,Stephens, Calvin R. The Life and Contributions of Zebedee Coltrin (1974), Master's thesis, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. Stillman and Abigail removed south from Salt Lake to Spanish Fork in 1857. But less than three years later, in 1860, they turned back again, this time to Cache Valley's Richmond in the far north ‚Äì just months before shots were fired at Fort Sumter in the East the following spring. Their hard-won livelihoods passed quietly during the years of national Civil War. The Ponds considered themselves greatly blessed.The Endowment House, est. 1855, Temple Block, Salt Lake City, Utah.  Endowment officiator, Seventy's President and Apostolic mentoree  Stillman had been able to officiate in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City under the supervision of President Heber C. Kimball, but also, at the Council House, to be mentored in mathematics and astronomy in the evenings under the clear, guiding voice of Apostle Orson Pratt. In 1852 Stillman had once again married, this time to Elizabeth Bessac, by whom he was given another child. But his fourth wife divorced him a few years later and married another man. Yet was Stillman's fidelity and obedience rewarded by church leaders, and on February 16, 1853 he was ordained Senior President of the 35th Quorum of Seventy ‚Äì a calling and capacity he faithfully fulfilled for the remainder of his days.John Buxton & Mary Anner Pond  Eldest son, ZCMI investor and St. George Temple laborer  Notwithstanding those hard-life years in Richmond, Stillman received for his comfort (on June 25, 1865) a second patriarchal blessing under the hand of Patriarch Charles W. Hyde ‚Äì just weeks after the assassination of President Lincoln (Stillman's eldest daughter by Abigail, Mary Anner Pond, only 4 weeks before Lincoln's death, had married John Buxton, an English immigrant who became a successful businessman in Teton Valley, Idaho; they raised 12 children).Bowen, Rhoda. John and Mary Anner Buxton: Life Sketch. FamilySearch.Construction of the St. George Temple, 1871‚Äì1877. Stillman Pond was among the early Latter-day Saints who quarried stone for Utah's first Mormon temple, dedicated April 6, 1877 by President Brigham Young. Three years after receiving his second patriarchal blessing, Stillman returned to his natal home of Hubbardston, Massachusetts, upon the occasion of his father's passing. There, he secured his 'eldest' son's portion of his father's estate, returning again to Utah to invest his inheritance in the Richmond Co-op, known as the ZCMI ‚Äì an investment that proved to be a wise and profitable one. In his later years, Stillman would travel south to St. George to assist in hauling quarry-stone for the building of a temple there.  Final years and family legacy  In 1870 Stillman married for a fifth and final time. A widow, Anna Regina Svensson-Jacobsen (alternatively, 'Swenson'), bore him an additional four sons before his death at age 74 (after a two-year lingering illness) on September 30, 1878. Third wife Abigail died 26 years later on March 7, 1904. By all of these wives Stillman would become grand- patriarch to a sea of descendants scattered throughout the intermountain West (and beyond) bearing such names as Buxton, Bowen, Merrill, Whittle, Kingsbury, Lewis, Egbert, Read, Pope, Telford, Yeats, Van Noy, Rose, and Russell. From a foundation of noble progenitors, Stillman left his multitudinous posterity with a mighty 'fire of faith' legacy ‚Äì one of sacrifice, endurance, and forging ahead (despite overwhelming heartache and loss) to realize, at last, through unflinching tenacity, persistent labor and love, a useful, abundant, and well-lived life.

On the night of her disappearance, Rahn was accompanied by a male and female friend at the apartment she shared with her mother, Judith, who was out on a date with her boyfriend. At some point during the evening, Rahn's male friend left the apartment after hearing voices in the hallway, assuming Rahn's mother was returning home. Her female friend remained at the apartment. Upon Judith's arrival home around midnight, she found that all of the lightbulbs in the apartment building's hallways had been unscrewed, leaving the halls completely dark. In the apartment, Judith saw a figure sleeping in her daughter's bed, and assumed it to be her; however, upon waking the next morning, she discovered it was in fact Rahn's female friend who had slept in the bed. Her friend claimed to have seen Rahn sleeping on the couch the night before. In the months after her disappearance, Judith received numerous phone calls from an unidentified caller, several of which were placed from motels in Santa Ana and Santa Monica, California. Law enforcement uncovered that one of these motels had been suspected of hosting the production of child pornography, but it was never confirmed that Rahn had been at either motel. Her mother continued to receive anonymous calls in the ensuing years before eventually changing her phone number. , Rahn's disappearance remains unsolved. Timeline =Disappearance= On the evening of April 26, 1980, Laureen Rahn was left to stay home at the residence she shared with her mother, a third-floor apartment on Merrimack Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. Her mother, Judith, was spending the evening attending an out-of-town tennis match with her boyfriend. Rahn, who was on spring break at the time, invited one male and one female friend over, and the three drank beer and wine together. At some point during the evening, Rahn's male friend heard voices in the apartment building's hallways, and exited the apartment through a back door, assuming that Rahn's mother was returning home and that he would get in trouble if he was found there. The male friend stated that he heard Rahn lock the door behind him as he left. Sometime around 1:15 a.m. on April 27, Judith arrived home, and noticed that the lightbulbs on all three of the apartment building's floors had been unscrewed, leaving the hallways completely dark. When she arrived at her apartment's front door, she found it unlocked. Before going to bed, Judith looked in Rahn's room and saw a figure asleep in bed, assuming it to be her daughter. Several hours later, around 3:45 a.m., Judith awoke and found that it had in fact not been Rahn asleep in her bed, but instead Rahn's female friend who had spent the night. Rahn's friend claimed that she had last seen Rahn asleep on the couch in the living room. Upon further examination of the apartment, Judith found articles of Rahn's clothing and her brand new sneakers in the living room, and the back door open. =Subsequent events= Daneault disappearance Six weeks after Rahn's disappearance, Denise Daneault, a young woman who lived two blocks from the Rahn residence, went missing from a bar in Manchester. Decades later, police determined that suspected serial killer Terry Peder Rasmussen was living in the area under the pseudonym \\"Bob Evans.\\" Rasmussen later pleaded guilty to murdering his wife in California in 2003, and died in 2010. Authorities believe Rasmussen may have been involved in as many as five more murders and/or disappearances, including that of Denise Beaudin, who vanished in Goffstown in 1981 and was never found, as well as the Bear Brook murders, which refers to four female murder victims found in the Bear Brook State Park between 1985 and 2000. One of the victims was his biological daughter. Phone calls On October 1, 1980, Judith found she had been charged for three phone calls placed in California; she did not have friends or relatives there, and Rahn had never had any ties to the area. Two calls were placed from a motel in Santa Monica, and another from a motel in Santa Ana, the latter of which was made to a teen sexual assistance hotline. Detectives spoke with the physician who maintained the hotline, and he initially denied having known anything of the call. Five years later, in 1985, the physician changed his story: He claimed that numerous young women and runaways occasionally visited his wife at their home, and that one of the girls may have been Rahn. He also stated that Annie Sprinkle, a sex educator and former pornographic actress who allegedly knew his wife, might have had information regarding Rahn's disappearance and those of other runaway girls. However, law enforcement was unable to find any evidence linking Sprinkle to Rahn's disappearance. Throughout 1981, Judith claimed to have received numerous mysterious phone calls from an unknown individual, which she always received at approximately 3:45 a.m. During these calls, Judith claimed the caller never spoke. The phone calls continued for several years after Rahn's disappearance, increasing in frequency during the Christmas holiday. The calls eventually stopped after she changed her phone number several years after Rahn's disappearance. Judith hired a private investigator to visit California in 1986, who located the motels from which the October 1980 phone calls had been placed. Local police in Santa Monica stated that one of the motels may have been used as a filming location by a child pornographer known as \\"Dr. Z\\"; however, law enforcement was unable to link Dr. Z to the hotline. The same year, a childhood friend of Rahn's named Roger Maurais received a phone call from a woman who claimed to be \\"Laurie\\" or Laureen. Maurais's mother answered the phone call and stated that the woman claimed to have been her son's former girlfriend. Alleged sightings In 1981, after the receipt of the October 1980 phone calls, a family member of Rahn's claimed to have seen her at a bus terminal in Boston, Massachusetts; this sighting remains unconfirmed. Another unconfirmed sighting occurred in 1988, when a witness claimed to have seen a prostitute in Anchorage, Alaska, who matched Rahn's description. Later developments Sometime after the mid-1980s, Judith remarried and relocated to Florida. She has stated that she believes her daughter placed the phone calls from California in October 1980. The unnamed male friend who was drinking alcohol with Rahn the night she disappeared committed suicide in 1985, though law enforcement never considered him a suspect in her disappearance. Investigators assigned to Rahn's case have stated they believe foul play is involved.

The parasitoid was successfully controlled the scale infestation in Texas in the 1950s and 60s. It is considered as one of the most successful examples of classical biological control. The species was first described by the Indian entomologist B R Subba Rao in 1957. The type was obtained from Antonina graminis in Bangalore by H.S. Sangwan after whom the species is named. The species completes one generation in about 20 days at 30 ¬∞C and about 50 to 60 days at 20 ¬∞C. The females are wingless, and short-lived while males have wings. In the two days lifespan, females lay about 6 eggs inside about 5 host scales. The control of rhodesgrass scale in Texas in the 1960s is considered one of the success stories in classical biological control. Entomologists H.A. Dean and others estimated that the parasitoid saved $17 million in turf management per year and would have boosted cattle production by an estimated $177 million per year. In Florida, the encyrtid parasitoid Anagyrus antoninae was displaced in Florida after the introduction of Neodusmetia sangwani in the 1950s. The species has also be introduced into Israel and Brazil. Because the females are wingless, the dispersal is limited to about 0.8 km per year, assuming that the populations survive through the year. The affected area was about 155,400 km2. which made it necessary to accelerate spread by airdropping grass sprigs with parasites in cardboard boxes at about 1 per 0.25 square mile. The cost of introducing the parasite at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station at Weslaco was estimated at under $200,000.

It is freely available via a web interface. It was previously sold as a CD-ROM for Mac and Windows. The TLFi was created by the Analyse et traitement informatique de la langue fran√ßaise (ATILF; Computer Processing and Analysis of the French Language) joint research group, a collaboration between the French National Center for Scientific Research and the University of Lorraine. French linguist Alain Rey participated in its creation.  History  The first upload of the TLFi took place in the early 90s at the National Institute of the French Language (INaLF) with the help of Alain Rey and Bernard Cerquiglini. The online version of the dictionary is presented without any modifications or updates. In 2001, the INaLF and Nancy 2 University collaborated to create the ATILF, a research lab associated with the French National Center for Scientific Research and the University of Lorraine. The dictionary became available on CD-ROM on November 5, 2004, for Windows and Mac OS X.  Description  The dictionary stems from the semantic analysis of the TLF and its analysis in several domains: definitions, usage examples, and semantic and lexical information. Taking advantage of the rich database extracted from its analysis, the dictionary offers not only the capability to search by entry but also the possibility to do more complex searches. The hypertext interface allows for referencing across different versions of the dictionary.  Contents  The TLFi contains definitions, examples from literary excerpts, technical field usages guides, information on semantics, history, etymology, grammar, usages, and synonyms and antonyms as well as hierarchical analyses linking these individual pieces of information. The dictionary is composed of many different elementary components (definitions, examples, technical usage guides, etc) that allow complex searches at multiple levels: # \\"Article by article\\" visualization, allowing for the search of particular information (definitions, phrases) # Assisted search allowing more specific searches (by etymology, usage domain, region, etc) # Complex searches, such as searching within a subdomain with only two characters The content of the TLFi contains the content of the first edition of the TLF, and the ATILF indicates on its website that it has no plans to be updated.

Construction began in August 1993, and the tower was commissioned on 6 January 1996. The budget was equivalent to recent control towers of conventional construction. In 1995 the tower was awarded a high commendation in the Australian Steel Design Award for Buildings by the Australian Institute of Steel Construction (New South Wales).  Description  Sydney Airport Air Traffic Control Tower is approximately 0.1ha on Lawrence Hargreaves Drive, Sydney Airport, comprising the Air Traffic Control Tower and its base building located within Land Parcel 8/DP1050923. The control tower complex occupies a central position in the airport, to the north of the point at which General Holmes Drive goes under the main north- south runway. The tower is staffed 24hrs a day, every day of the year. The cabin floor is 38.5m above ground level; 42.85m to the cabin roof. = Exterior = Sydney 5 control tower comprises a cable-stayed pre-cast concrete shaft with an external passenger lift to the north. A spiral escape staircase sweeps around the concrete shaft, which is positioned just off-centre of the circular single-storey base building. The amenities/equipment level cantilevers from the top of the shaft, with the circular control cabin above. The design concept is described by architect Ken Woolley:'Control Tower, Sydney Airport,' Ken Woolley, of Ancher, Mortlock & Woolley, April 1995. > \\"The geometry of the design is based on an equilateral triangle or tri-star > plan with a slim pre-cast central column in which services run, supporting a > steel strutted and cantilevered platform and braced by post-tensioned steel > rods to three points on the base building. This ensures the most rigid, > sway-free structure with the advantage of prefabrication for rapid > construction.\\" The doughnut-shaped plan of the base building is broken to the north-east to accommodate an opening for a paved pathway, which leads to an entrance lobby at the south of a sheltered courtyard. The lobby was extended into the courtyard in c. 1998 to create a larger reception area. The base building is sheathed in glass and aluminium panels. The roof, like all areas of roofing at the ATC complex including the roof of the cabin, is a waterproof membrane with pre-cast concrete panels above. A canopy projects from the south-west, shielding the primary point of access to the equipment rooms. The off-white segmental concrete shaft is 2.5m in diameter and 20m high, with a flat face to the north to which the lift is attached by steel fly-braces. A metal column rising from the top of the concrete shaft carries the steel cloverleaf platform above. The lift shaft has a metal frame, painted yellow, with translucent glass panels. The lift terminates at the amenities/service level. The platform for the amenities/services level was lifted from the ground in one piece. It is strutted by stainless steel fittings and tension adjusters, brought down to three piers at the edge of the base building. The platform has a cloverleaf plan of six bays formed by radiating steel ribs. The six bays, nicknamed \\"beer cans\\", are clad in reflective blue-tinted glass panels. The circular cabin has 18 panels of outward canted frameless glass. The 12m-diameter cabin roof, carried on a central column rising through the cabin, is stabilised by thin stainless steel rods outside the joints of the frameless 25mm-thick glass. The cabin roof accommodates surface movement radar, warning lights and a crown of aerials and lightning conductors. The spiral staircase is a rectangular tube of 18 cranked facets in aluminium panels punctuated by small porthole windows. Two diagonally trussed steel walkways provide stability and access to the concrete shaft. The fire stair extends from the roof of the base building to a balcony - with an external platform - below the amenities/services bays. A return flight of stairs inside a single-storey concrete cylinder provides access from ground level to the bottom of the spiral staircase. = Interior = The base building accommodates the plant room, standby generator, uninterrupted power supply, equipment rooms, staff amenities, reception area, offices and meeting room. Finishes throughout are utilitarian and consistent with the mid-1990s period of the construction. Alterations to the base building since construction include the extension of the lobby (c. 1998), and modifications to the subdivision of the east wing to accommodate additional office space. The six bays that comprise the amenities and plant-room level are arranged in three pairs with differing functions. The two bays to the north accommodate air-conditioning plant; the two bays to the south-east are staff stand-down areas, including a galley; the two bays to the south-west accommodate equipment racks and facilities. Toilets are to the west of the central lift lobby and circulation space, with staircases extending to the cabin above and the escape stair below. The floors are reinforced concrete, carpeted in the central lobby and stand-down areas; exposed in the air conditioning plant and equipment rooms. Ceilings in the lobby and stand- down areas are lined with perforated metal acoustic panels with recessed vents and lighting. Paint throughout is generally light-coloured. The cabin, accessed via a carpeted curving staircase, is arranged around a central steel column, from which six cantilevers splay at the top to supports the cabin roof. This arrangement has the advantage of avoiding interference to sightlines by external columns, and also facilitates the use of peripheral consoles. Consoles abut the edge of the circular cabin (diameter 7.5m) to the east, north and west. The cabin managers' desk is to the south (rear). The consoles use touch-screen technology of the type used in modern aircraft, giving controllers access to situational radar, communication and meteorological data displays. The cabin ceiling is lined with perforated metal acoustic panels. The cabin roof is accessed by a drop ladder to the south of the cabin ceiling. The concrete floor is carpeted. Storage space is limited. Cabinetry has been installed around the base of the central column and to the south-facing wall. The risers and treads of the spiral escape staircase are steel, painted white. = Condition = The ATC complex is largely intact as built, externally and internally, with the only significant modification being the extension of the curved entrance foyer to accommodate a larger reception area.  Heritage listing  The Sydney 5 ATC complex was conceived in the early-1990s, when government approval was granted for a new parallel north- south runway at Sydney Airport, a development that meant the existing control tower (Sydney 4) would no longer have visual access to all areas of the runways and taxiways. The new tower was designed by architects Ancher Mortlock & Woolley Pty Ltd (design architect Ken Woolley) to specifications prepared by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Documentation was complete in 1993, with construction occurring between 1993 and 1995. The complex was commissioned on 6 January 1996. The control tower is an elaboration of existing column-and-pod tower forms. It comprises a cable-stayed pre-cast concrete shaft with a steel and glass passenger lift attached. A cranked spiral stair sweeps around the concrete shaft. The amenities/equipment level adopts an unusual clover-like plan form (series of circular pods) and is cantilevered out from the top of the shaft, with the circular control cabin above this; both use distinctive facetted blue tinted glazing. The cabin roof is 42.85m above ground level. A number of new ideas, both architectural and technical, were applied at Sydney 5. It is the only cable-stayed control tower in Australia. The cabin roof, carried on a single central column, was another \\"first\\" in Australia - the centralised column avoids interruption to sightlines by external columns. Sydney 5 was also the first Australian tower with a circular cabin fitted with a peripheral console, an established format internationally and the preferred future form of console in Australia (this was a requirement of the brief). The external expression of the tower was an innovative and highly creative interpretation of the standard brief for control towers, adapting conventional control tower forms to explore the potential presented by its prominent site. An assured and resolved design by Ken Woolley, a prominent award-winning architect, Sydney 5 ATC tower stands as the first (and to date, the only) control tower in Australia consciously designed as a landmark, and displaying such distinctive and flamboyant architectural qualities. Its predecessors in the Australian context were either utilitarian structures based on standardised models (1950s- 1980s), or imposing but comparatively restrained forms consisting of slender concrete columns surmounted by amenities/services with cabins above (late-1960s to present). By way of comparison, the towers at Perth Airport (commissioned 1986) and Brisbane Airport (1988) are taller but far more restrained architecturally; both are facetted concrete columns flaring at c. 45m to accommodate amenities/services and control cabins. Since the completion of Sydney 5, a number of tall and aesthetically-striking control towers with \\"landmark\\" qualities have been constructed overseas. Examples include Malpensa Airport, Italy (2001), Vienna Airport, Austria (2006), Heathrow Airport, England (2007) and Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand (2006), which is the world's tallest free-standing control tower. Sydney Airport Air Traffic Control Tower was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 January 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion F: Technical achievement Sydney Air Traffic Control tower embodies a number of new ideas, both architectural and technical. It is the only cable- stayed control tower in Australia, and one of very few internationally. The cabin roof, carried on a single central column, was another Australian \\"first\\" - the central column avoids interruption to sightlines by external columns. It was the first Australian tower with a circular cabin, and first to be fitted with a peripheral console, an established format internationally and the preferred future form in Australia. The requirement for unimpeded sightlines over the expanded airport dictated the use of peripheral consoles, which in turn informed the requirement for a central column to support the cabin roof. These design features, practically resolved at Sydney 5 Air Traffic Control tower, were requirements of the brief. Sydney 5 was also the first tower in Australia to employ computer screen-based technology for its control consoles, derived from the \\"fly-by-wire\\" concept used in modern aircraft. The touch- screen consoles give controllers ready access to radar, communication and meteorological data displays. The use of touch-screen technology is consistent with on-going international developments in air traffic management. However, it is the formal appearance of Sydney 5 ATC tower that is considered to be of greatest interest. Australian towers built subsequent to Sydney 5 (commissioned in 1996) have been variations on the column-and-pod model, while a number of towers built overseas since Sydney 5 have been designed as civic markers.

It is located on the grounds of Harrington Grove, which is part of the Harrington Park estate. Orielton was restored as the focus of a three-year plan by Harrington Estates, who was developing the surrounding suburbs on behalf of the trust of Mary Fairfax. History =Edward Lord: The First Land Grant (1814‚Äì1822)= The Orielton Homestead was part of the 1,620 acres of land granted to Edward Lord by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in Macarthur. Lord named his property Orielton after the Orielton estate in Pembroke, Wales, which the Lord family had previously inherited. Lord traveled to Australia as an officer in the Royal Navy in 1803, and was part of the first contingent to establish a settlement of the Derwent, Van Dieman's Land (now called Tasmania). Lord built the first primitive hut on the Orielton Homestead but never lived there. =John Dickson (1822‚Äì1841)= In 1813, Scottish industrialist John Dickson arrived in the colonies for his promise to set up the first steam mill in Sydney. Macquarie was ordered by British authorities to grant Dickson land in both town and country. His country land grant was in the Bringelly region. Over time, Dickson increased his land holdings to 17,000 acres in the Cowpastures. In 1822 he bought Orielton. Dickson owned the only steam mill in Sydney for nearly a decade. The growing population in the early 1820s meant that milling was highly profitable. Dickson never lived at Orielton, but he built the original four- room cottage homestead that was used as an outstation for farm managers who yielded crops and hay from the area. The residence was positioned below the ridgeline to protect it from the wind and with the perfect vantage point over the plains to oversee production. =John & Susannah Perry (1847‚Äì1861)= Orielton had a series of absent landowners until John Perry, a Camden-based miller and confectioner, and his wife, Susannah, bought the property. Upon their arrival at Orielton, Perry and his wife had eight children: five girls and three boys. However, there was a series of deaths in his family over a four-year period, including the death of his wife Susannah in 1857.As published in Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), Tuesday 31 July 1855, page 8 and Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954), Tuesday 20 May 1856, page 1 and Empire (Sydney, NSW : 1850 - 1875), Saturday 29 August 1857, page 4 Perry's contribution to the Orielton Homestead was to convert the small farming outstation into a family home. He used the existing Dickson buildings and, over many years, embellished and improved the homestead with eight rooms, wide verandahs, kitchens, servants' rooms, dairy, and stores. =Harriet Beard (1876‚Äì1912)= Harriet Beard is long credited as the visionary of Orielton who created and extended the grand house on the hill. She was a wealthy widow who had made her fortune on the goldfields of Hill End when she took ownership of Orielton. In 1871, Beard was recorded to have held a third of the share in three highly lucrative finds. An investment for that year alone returned nearly ¬£60,000 to Beard.As reported in Southern Mail (Bowral, NSW : 1889 - 1954), Friday 24 December 1937, page 5 She undertook an extensive scope of work over many years, which doubled the size of the previous homestead to 26 rooms in total, including adding broad wrap-around verandahs, separate servants‚Äô quarters, and bay windows overlooking the grounds. =Sir Warwick Fairfax and Lady Mary Fairfax (1944‚Äìpresent)= In 1944, John Fairfax & Sons purchased Orielton and Harrington Park. They used the land together for stud Hereford cattle breeding and management. Part of the farm building complex, previously used for dairy farming, was adapted to accommodate the new cattle management. The large barn was demolished due to engineering concerns. By 1952, the paddocks of Orielton were reorganized to facilitate stud breeding. The paddocks' names had various inspirations, such as ‚ÄúCamp Paddock‚Äù referring to the military camp of WWII, the ‚ÄúOak Paddock‚Äù referring to the extensive She-oaks (Allocasuarina), and the ‚ÄúHill Paddock‚Äù referring to the western landmark. After Warwick Fairfax died in 1987, Mary Fairfax continued to bring communities to the suburbs of Harrington Park and Harrington Grove and restore the grand homes that sat upon the estates. In 2015, Harrington Estates, developer of Harrington Grove, Harrington Park, and Catherine Park, began to restore Orielton on behalf of Mary Fairfax. The house was also used by a veterinarian, a goat farmer, and a cult in the 1960s. During World War II, it was used as a military base.Symonds, Earl Army Platoon 1941 ‚Äì 1945 ‚Äì History of 2nd Australian Army Troops Coy RAE AIF http://bsymonds.net/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/Earl-Army-ww2-2nd-AIF-s.pdf Restoration The three- year restoration of Orielton Homestead was led by Tropman & Tropman Architects. Cultural significance of Orielton The Cowpastures of the Camden area played an essential role in the development of the Sydney Colony. The two bulls and five cows that wandered from Sydney Cove in 1795 and were found thriving seven years later along the Nepean River were significant in the development of early Sydney and New South Wales. Properties such as Orielton continued to build upon the expanding Sydney Colony. Harrington Estates managed three properties: Orielton, Harrington Park House, and Catherine Park House. Orielton is considered exceptional because of the integrity of its rural setting and the demonstrable functional relationships within the homestead and farm complex. It is a good representative example of a gentleman's estate from the 1840s, and possibly as early as the 1820s (granted in 1815).

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  The township of Temora evolved from a local pastoral settlement in the 1860s, to a large town of about 20,000 people in the 1880s, following the discovery of gold in 1879. German settlers were also prominent in the area from the 1850s. The construction of the railway line to Temora in 1893 brought on a new phase of progress, cementing the town's importance as a wheat and wool growing centre. A post office was constructed after the railway's arrival but it was destroyed by fire in 1901, a most destructive episode which destroyed a number of local buildings. The present Temora Post Office was constructed in 1903-4 by Rigby Brothers for ¬£2,448. The building was designed by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon with George Oakeshott, being the architect in charge of Post Office designs. The postmaster moved into the first floor residence on 11 April 1904. The banisters and counters inside the post office were reputedly carved by Robert Cutting, Snr. Recent alterations include the replacement of the telephone exchange to the rear of the building with a local museum, the removal of telephone boxes, scales and stamp vending machines, and the addition of a ramp to the front of the office. A staff amenities building has been built at the rear, along with an additional in-coming, bulk mail room, steel handling platform and truck canopy. There is a carport and garden shed located alongside an earlier weatherboard shed.  Description  Temora Post Office is at 173 Hoskins Street, Temora, facing south west on a \\"wayside\\" frontage in Hoskins Street (Barmedman Road), 25m south of the Loftus Street corner (Young Road). The adjoining building to its immediate north is imposing: a distinctly American Romanesque-Queen Anne fusion. The building to the immediate south, a branch of the ANZ Bank, is similar in approach, with horseshoe arches, strapwork and mortarboard cornices. This side of Hoskins Street comprises an impressive Federation period streetscape. It was largely built up at one time, replacing several buildings destroyed in a large town fire in April 1901.Temora Council DB, p. 2 = Exterior = The Post Office building is an asymmetrical design with two corner towers, each with a broad arched opening at its base and battered in from a plinth. The plinth is capped with a string course of painted cant bricks (also used at Quirindi). The building has been built in stretcher bond, with mottled, dark pink/brown bricks. Wall vents are cast, with a crown emblem, commonly used in government buildings. Elsewhere there are terracotta \\"egg-crate\\" form vents. The right (southeast) tower has plain corners; the left (northwest) tower has piers at each corner. Both are crossed by string courses at the arch springing points and at the first floor line. A third string course runs through around waist level on the first floor, marking a change to roughcast stucco on the right tower and the brick base for a bullseye window on the left, originally intended to house a clock, the rear works of which would evidently have projected into one of the quarters rooms. The left tower is sheeted in roughcast stucco above the bullseye and its base, and the roof is pyramidal with flared hips. There is a series of ten, slender wrought iron diagonal struts supporting a \\"flying\\" timber plate. The struts are wrought in an Art Nouveau pattern. The roofing tiles are English pattern, and the gutters are quad profile, copper, and mounted on square dressed fascia boards without detail. The eaves are boxed to conceal the rafters, and lined with a flat sheet, possibly an early example of asbestos-cement sheeting. The left tower has a \\"bulls-eye\\" round window comprising nine panes of glass. The left tower has a simple open stilted arch for the main entry. There are non-original concrete steps with a steel handrail giving access to the main entry porch and some of the facility's post boxes. The porch has a tiled floor and a painted timber ceiling. Entry doors are timber framed, and primarily glazed and located in the south wall of the porch. They broadly match the entry doors at the right-hand side of the fa√ßade. There is a surviving eight-pane transom window above. These doors are adjoined by the later disabled access ramp access which has been installed in front of the building, infilling the recessed middle bay of the building. The ramp structure apparently conceals the building's foundation stone. The right tower has no roof struts and is marked by two simply indented square-headed windows. The ground floor arches are also related, both being crowned by six or seven rows of headers, but are at differing heights and treated differently inside each arch. The right tower arch is combined with a window whose glazing bars denote a door fanlight, upper sidelight windows and line up vertically with a cut in the brick wall to either side of its double door. The recessed middle bay houses the former postal hall at ground floor level and the open verandah of the quarters above. The postal hall has three brick segmental- headed double-hung sash windows, embedded in a broad, shallow and slanted sill. The stiles of the upper sash are tapered. The first floor verandah is divided by two tapering piers that directly support a light fascia and balcony roof, treated as integral with the main roof behind and above it. The stuccoed piers reflect the Federation bungalow fashion emerging at this time. The openings are screened with mesh to exclude birds. The side elevations are equally varied, with a chamfered bay on the southeast elevation and a straight fronted gable on the northwest elevation. The three main chimneys are irregularly placed in the upper roof hips, and are given a strongly arts and crafts flavour, the stacks being tapered and clad in roughcast stucco, then topped with long, tapering terra cotta pots. There is a fascia and boxed eaves to conceal rafters at the roof edges, and the eave soffits are boarded and raked at the same angle as the roof above. To the west elevation a projecting bay with tall sash windows to the angled faces are of face brick with contrasting, terracotta coloured brick quoins. Immediately behind there is a side access door to the stairhall and thus to the former quarters. It has a slate threshold and step. The stair window is leadlight in an art-Nouveau design. There are copper gutters, spouts and downpipes which feed into cast iron downpipes about 2 metres from ground level. Brick sills have been rendered and painted. They finish flush, and do not extend over the wall to form a drip mould. At the rear of the building there is a door to the laundry with a distinctive, pressed metal hood. The door is ledged and sheeted. There is a timber weatherboard garden shed in the garden, and a steel /timber carport. More recently a kit-type zincalume garden shed has been added. The garden is surrounded by timber and corrugated iron fences on a brick base. There are several surviving bullnose brick retaining walls. The rear of the post office yard is paved with concrete and asphalt. There is a steel canopy to protect delivery trucks, and a small zincalume shed which once sheltered bicycles. Under the canopy is a steel loading ramp, leading to a roller shutter to the delivery room. The delivery room is an addition to the sorting room. To the east elevation, alterations have occurred to allow the introduction of additional post boxes. There is a raised concrete platform to give access, fitted with a steel handrail, and aluminium awnings for protection. One set of boxes have been inserted into a former window aperture, and the brickwork above has been patched. The sorting room is a single storey structure, under a gabled roof with a brick parapet. It has Marseilles-pattern roof tiles exposed rafters, quad gutter and rectangular downpipes. The eaves are timber lined, and there is painted netting between the rafters. The windows are double hung, with a transom, and fitted with \\"amplimesh\\" aluminium screens. = Interior = The general office (main chamber) has been upgraded to provide modern retail and a range of postal services. It has carpet over a timber floor, and modern joinery and retail displays. Many original elements survive, such as windows, strapped ceilings, consoles, an arch and chamfered plaster nibs. The ceiling is a modern, suspended type, and conceals air conditioning ducts and services. The main chamber is divided from the service areas by modern plasterboard partition walls. The postal box filling room has vinyl flooring over timber, plaster walls, original double hung windows, a strapped plaster ceiling and a distinctive concrete column to support the upper floor. The sorting room is housed in a single storey wing. There are original timber framed multi paned sash windows with transoms to the west wall. Some of the glazing bars have been removed to the transoms have been altered. The room has a distinctive cornice. The Post Master's Office is located in the projecting bay to the east side of the building. It has two double hung sash windows and a corner fireplace which has been sealed. One of its two doors has been replaced with a flush panel door and splayed architraves. The other door, leading to the stairwell is a four-panel door, and has an ogee pattern architrave which is original. A suspended ceiling has been installed. The rear office is formed with plasterboard partitions and remnants of earlier decorative plaster detailing are visible. The stationery storeroom room retains its small double-hung window and its timber ceiling with v-jointed boards and Edwardian painted timber cornice. It has four brick walls, with a sealed arch and 2 unused doorways. One leads up to the adjacent kitchen. The kitchen contains a sealed fireplace and a 1950s vintage sink bench. There are built-in cupboards next to the chimney breast. The door has been replaced with a flush leaf. The plaster walls include a 'dado. The original double hung window is extant within the space. The laundry has a concrete floor covered in vinyl. Walls are of painted brick and the entry door is braced and ledged. The ceiling is painted, v-jointed boards and has a manhole. The double hung window has an elongated bottom sash. The kitchen adjoins an enclosed verandah with a raked timber ceiling and concrete floor. The original posts are visible between the glass louvres and painted \\"infill\\" studwork. This appears to be of 1950s construction. There is one unused exit door, and another door leading to the toilets outside. The toilets are housed in a separate building with a timber frame and asbestos cement linings. It has a coved concrete floor and raked ceiling under a gable roof and fixed louvre windows, cast-iron basins, braced and ledged doors and simple timber details. Much of the interior is painted in a grey colour scheme, but there is evidence of an earlier cream scheme. = Condition = The building is in sound condition, although there are instances of the effects of salt damp. There are some roof tiles which have slipped. Some exterior painted surfaces need attention. Some of the interior displays routine wear and tear. The level of intactness is comparatively good given age and changes in use. There are effects of rising damp in some areas.  Heritage listing  Temora Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Temora Post Office, built in 1904, originally incorporated a post office, residence and rear telephone exchange, now replaced by a museum. Historically, in its original state, the post office has provided an important civic function for this regional centre from the early years of the twentieth century. This, in combination with the fact that the post office was rebuilt after a disastrous local fire, and immediately following Federation, along with a number of other important civic and commercial buildings in this part of town, to form a conspicuous and highly valued Federation-era streetscape, elevates the building to CHL threshold for this value. The significant components of Temora Post Office include the main 1904 post office building. Criterion D: Characteristic values Temora Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) Federation-era Public Free Style. Designed by the office of the New South Wales State Government Architect, under the aegis of W L Vernon. George Oakeshott was the architect in charge of Post Office designs. Typologically, in its original state, Temora Post Office was highly characteristic of its period, with a combination of post office, telegraph and residential functions. While the replacement of the rear telephone exchange, and modifications to the residential and post office areas have diminished the typological attributes, an overall understanding of the original workings of the post office remain. * an unusual combination of Arts and Crafts with some Japanese influences expressed in a Federation-era public building. Its exterior demonstrates the Federation period sense of line and plane, with a distinctive pitch change in the left hand tower roof. The building also successfully integrates the Federation themes of round-arches, face-brick and roughcast rendering, bracketing, expressive tiled roof forms, and irregular planning that responds to internal particulars. Externally it is also one of the better preserved two-storey post offices from the early Federation period. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Temora Post office is a lively and accomplished Federation design, expressing an unusual combination of Arts and Crafts and Japanese influences. It makes an important contribution to an impressive and coherent Federation streetscape, largely dating from the period following a disastrous local fire in April 1901. Criterion G: Social value The building could be considered to be of local social significance to the Temora community, as an important component of Temora's commercial centre for over a century.

Here is a list of the people who have served as an alderman since that time. Since its incorporation as a city in 1837 Chicago had been divided into wards whose number varied but which were almost always entitled to two aldermen. In the early 20th century it was decided that reducing the number of aldermen to a ward to one would be a cost-saving measure, and an ordinance to that effect was passed in 1920, taking effect in 1923. Aldermanic elections in Chicago have been formally nonpartisan since 1920. Nevertheless, many aldermen have had, and continue to have, de facto partisan affiliations that are reflected in this list. This list is organized by which side of the Chicago River the wards were on as of 1923. Numbering the wards such that those on the South Side received the first numbers, followed by in order the West and North sides was a tradition that had dated to the City's founding and division into wards in 1837. Incumbent aldermen who started a new term in 1923 are reckoned as having started their term in 1923 regardless of whenever they actually started holding office, which is noted in the \\"Notes\\" column. History Chicago was incorporated in 1837 and initially comprised six wards.

Early career  After graduating from Englewood High School, South Side, Chicago, in 1941, Rubin enlisted into a University of Chicago run pre- meteorology training program (class \\"B\\") for the United States Army Air Forces (AAF); active duty effective March 3, 1943.HEADQUARTERS, SIXTH SERVICE COMMAND, SERVICES OF SUPPLY, Special Orders No. 31. (5 February 1943) Basic training was at Fort Sheridan with classes held at the University of Michigan. Rubin finished his training in September 1943, and was shipped off first to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and then later to the Philippines, to help forecast weather for AAF long range flights in the Pacific Theater of World War II.HEADQUARTERS, DETROIT CIVILIAN SCHOOLS AREA, AAF CENTRAL TECHNICAL TRAINING COMMAND, Special Orders No. 52 (21 Sept., 1943) After Japan surrendered, Rubin was sent to Tokyo as part of the post war occupation. Rubin returned to the States in 1946 and attended the University of Chicago, from which he earned his master's degree, and later his Ph.D. in Geology. Rubin joined the U.S. Geological Survey, Washington, D.C., on June 14, 1950 as a member of the Branch of Military Geology, then led by Frank C. Whitmore, Jr.  Radiocarbon laboratory  In 1952, Hans E. Suess was hired by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to set up a radiocarbon dating laboratory in Washington, D.C. and built the radiocarbon apparatus in a basement space in the GSA Building (former Department of the Interior Building) located at 1800 F St., NW. A basement space was needed due to the extreme mass of the two steel and lead shielded counter assemblies. In early 1953, Corrine Alexander joined the radiocarbon project, followed by Rubin in December of the same year. Routine radiocarbon measurements were begun in the summer of 1953. Willard Libby, inventor of the dating method and 1960 Nobel Prize winner used a solid carbon method for sample determination, whereas Suess, upon seeing Libby's method in Chicago knew that he would try the gas, acetylene C2H2, as he had success with acetylene in the 1930s in Germany for other radiochemical determinations. This was a significant step as it allowed more efficient counting and easy movement of the counting material between the extraction apparatus, gas purification line and the two counters. Rubin initially assisted in the acetylene preparation, and as a geologist provided valuable input on the selection of samples and interpretation of results. In the first two years, the laboratory produced approximately 200 age determinations, which were critically important to unravel the various details of the most recent Pleistocene glaciation, the Wisconsin stage, among other geological problems. Rubin became director of the USGS Radiocarbon Laboratory in 1955 when Suess left to set up a new laboratory at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA. The next few years at the USGS were devoted to perfecting the acetylene technique and applying it to a multitude of geological and archaeological research. Rubin continued his research on the Wisconsin glacial stage and used the results for his doctoral dissertation, earning his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1956. In 1973, Rubin and the laboratory moved into a newly built USGS national headquarters in Reston, Virginia. Rubin kept a room full of samples in the lab as part of the \\"tour,\\" which included samples he said were wood relics from King Solomon's mines and the Queen of Sheba's palace, linen wraps from the Dead Sea Scrolls, and a large piece of whale baleen. He also kept a guest book he would ask visitors to sign.  History of work  In April 1955, Rubin and Suess published the second set of results from the lab's first year of operation. One of their main focuses was on establishing an absolute time scale for the Wisconsin glaciation substages prior to what was known as the Mankato substage (the most recent glacial advance, around 9,000-11,000 years ago). Suess's acetylene method for carbon counting extended the dating range back to approximately 45,000 years, making it possible to fix in time pre- Mankato glacial events by dating wood and other organic material from older glacial deposits. Richard Foster Flint assembled a collection of samples that were dated at the lab. Some of the samples were collected by Rubin in collaboration with other geologists such as J Harlen Bretz (who was Rubin's Geomorphology professor at UChicago), Carl Leland Horberg, William John Wayne, Richard Parker Goldthwait, James Zumberge, and Donald Eschman. Samples were collected by other collectors as well. Flint and Rubin published a brief assessment of the stratigraphic meaning of these samples and their age determinations in May 1955. One of the conclusions was that a major glaciation began 25,000 or more years ago and reached a maximum about 20,000 years ago. The results were consistent. In 1963, Rubin questioned the validity of dates from sea snail shells. Experiments showed that snails could uptake 10-12 percent inorganic carbonate from limestone, yielding an uncertainty in the dates of approximately one thousand years. In 1964, Rubin and A. A. Rosen, of the U.S. Public Health Service, showed that by measuring content of surface water it is possible to determine the relative contributions of industrial pollution (from fossil fuels) and domestic pollution (from domestic sewage and garbage) in streams‚Äîdesirable information for planning abatement measures. An activated carbon filter system was used to collect samples of organic contaminants in water, which were then extracted using chloroform and ethanol, and converted to acetylene for measurement, making use of a double-tube combustion system developed to completely burn the highly flammable samples in a controlled manner. Fossil carbon such as petroleum, natural gas, and coal is depleted in compared to the contemporary carbon in animal and plant matter. Their data was reported as a proportion of contemporary carbon to fossil carbon, and the results where consistent with the known pollution sources at the chosen sample sites, and provided new information at sites where this proportion could not be predicted by other means. This work was expanded upon in 1975 by Spiker and Rubin, when they published a water pollution study describing the measurement of activity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water and groundwater, this time applying high-intensity ultraviolet radiation to large water samples to convert DOC to via photo-oxidation, for measurement. This was one of the early investigations of groundwater DOC impacted by industrial and municipal pollution. In 1965, Bruce B. Hanshaw, William Back, and Rubin determined the origin of saline water contaminating the Ocala Limestone aquifer near Brunswick, Georgia by measuring the activity of water in and around the aquifer. They found that the contamination was coming from the underlying Claiborne Group, which had relatively low content due to lack of exposure to atmospheric carbon, and not from the nearby ocean. These results were in agreement with previous investigations using piezometric maps and other more traditional hydrologic data. This work laid the foundation for the use of carbon isotopes to delineate flow systems in regional carbonate aquifers. First publishing together in 1967, George Plafker, Rubin, and their colleagues did painstaking fieldwork after the magnitude 9.2 Alaskan earthquake in 1964, covering hundreds of kilometers of Alaskan shoreline in small boats, helicopters, and float-equipped aircraft after the 1964 quake helped to launch a new field of megathrust earthquake geology, which used observations of the placement and dating of intertidal organisms such as acorn barnacles, mussels and rockweed to determine the amounts of vertical change in land relative to sea level near subduction zones. Plafker and his colleagues determined that the massive Alaskan quake was caused by rupture along a deeply buried fault in a subduction zone where the Pacific tectonic plate thrusts north below the North American plate. Earlier accounts of the Alaskan earthquake had suggested that the quake took place as slip along a vertical fault, as the Pacific plate rotated counter-clockwise against the North American plate. These studies by Plafker, Rubin and colleagues were very important evidence for the existence of subduction processes during the early debates of plate tectonics. See for a geological and historical summary. In 1968, Rubin co-authored with John Chapman Frye, H. B. Willman, and R. F. Black the official USGS \\"Definition of Wisconsinan Stage,\\" which defined and described the Wisconsinan Stage of the Pleistocene and its substages as time- stratigraphic units for use in Illinois and Wisconsin. In 1973, Rubin dated charcoal from campfires used by Paleo-Indians at Flint Run Complex in the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, to be 10,000 years old‚Äîthe oldest evidence of man in the state at the time. Rubin thoroughly analyzed Mount St. Helens in the years and months preceding its 1980 eruption. He worked with Dwight Crandell and Donal R. Mullineaux on their paper published in 1975, which correctly predicted an eruption could occur before the turn of the century. In 1977, Rubin collaborated with Harry E. Gove and others in early demonstrations of successful measurement using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the University of Rochester. Development of this technique made possible the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin, as it allowed for much smaller samples to be used. Gove had a central role in the Shroud project and brought Rubin in for his expertise. What is today the Great Salt Lake in Utah was previously a massive Lake Bonneville which covered most of northern Utah. Rubin and colleagues determined the changing levels of this ancient lake including a catastrophic flood caused by a sudden overflow of the lake, known as the Bonneville flood. This very exciting epoch in the geologic history of North America was followed chronologically by Rubin in a series a radiocarbon dates, which contributed to publications such as \\"Great Salt Lake, and precursors, Utah: the last 30,000 years\\" (1984). In August 1986, thousands of people were found dead on the shores of Lake Nyos, Cameroon. John P. Lockwood and Rubin found that the lake's maar may have been formed by an explosive eruption, and that could still be trapped under the lake‚Äîit's gradual release into the waters setting the stage for the tragic gas-release event. Rubin and colleagues contributed to our understanding of the evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes through hundreds of measurements starting in the late 60's, sample selection refinements, and significant publications in 1987. Rubin carried out work, in collaboration with Lucio Lirer and Giuseppe Rolandi (University of Naples Federico II), a collaboration arranged by Rubin's long-time friend and fellow geologist Harvey E. Belkin, determining the age of the Breccia Museo (museum breccia), a proximal deposit attributed to the 39,000 BCE eruption of the Campanian Ignimbrite. The Breccia Museo deposit is controversial regarding its chronology and origin and this study added to that discussion and the realization that the deposit may be more complex and varied than had been understood.  Awards and honors  In 1956, Rubin received a Washington Academy of Sciences Award in the Physical Sciences. In 1974, Rubin received a Department of the Interior Meritorious Service Award. Rubin has been designated as a Scientist Emeritus for the Eastern Geology & Paleoclimate Science Center, now renamed the Florence Bascom Geoscience Center, Reston, VA, by the USGS. On a less serious note, Rubin was also given the 1962 Geological Society of Washington Sleeping Bear Award for best humor during a GSW meeting.  Personal life  Rubin was born in Chicago to Jewish immigrants from Kiev. He met his wife, Mary Louise Rubin ( Tucker), in high school. They raised three sons, John, Robert, and Mark, and were married for 72 years before she died in 2015. Rubin made close friends through the US Army Air Force weatherman training, in Frank Wrobel, Mick McCullough, and Frank Getz, who were all shipped to different Pacific theaters during the war. Rubin was also close friends with Edward C. T. Chao, who is known for coesite, stishovite, and tektites, as they were both at one time in the USGS Branch of Military Geology, though they had no scientific relationship. Rubin and Art Buchwald had at least two things in common‚Äîhumor and kidney stones. Enabled by go- between Frank Forrester, \\"Project BUCHWALDSTONE\\" was a spoof project in which Rubin, Ed Dwornik and other scientists studied Buchwald's kidney stones, which were, according to Rubin, much smaller than his own. Rubin was an avid kayaker in his prime, known on the Potomac River as \\"Dr. Kayak\\" by many. He wrote a spoof advice column in \\"The Cruiser\\" (newsletter of the Canoe Cruisers Association) under the same title. Rubin was also an enthusiastic collector of found bobbers.

It is also known as Williamtown RAAF Base Group. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  The area of the base, on coastal land, was first settled as grants probably initially used for pastoral grazing. Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass was granted in 1840, preceded by William Harvey's grant of in 1839. In the 1880s Snodgrass's original grant was subdivided into small farms for dairy farming. William Harvey's grant had been broken up by the 1860s, also into small farms, at a time when the village area of Williamtown was first established. A school and post office had opened by 1868. By the 1920s the area had become part of the farm district supplying the Raymond Terrace Cooperative Dairy and Produce Company Ltd, set up in 1904. RAAF Base Williamtown appears to have grown from the recognition by local authorities in 1938 that Newcastle needed additional airport facilities to relieve pressure on the field at District Park, Broadmeadow. The Willamtown site was selected by the Australian Government and surveyed in August 1939, for the construction of an emergency landing ground prior to the onset of the World War II. An overriding factor was the proximity of Newcastle's steel mills and coal mines. A Hunter Water pumping station was erected in the late 1930s as part of the Tomago Sandbeds Water Supply Scheme, with a separate second pumping station erected to service the base. Work began in January 1940 with being spent on construction as part of the New South Wales Government's Unemployment Relief Program. Four runways were completed by September 1940. From September 1940 new facilities included a guard house, staff garages, control tower, flight operations room, medical rooms, kitchen, mess, airmen's and flight sergeants' dormitories and a compound for the construction authorities. By mid-December 1940 a total of 62 buildings had been completed in the \\"camp area\\" in the south-east sector of the aerodrome. The RAAF did not take over the base until February 1941, although Lockheed Hudson bombers had been stationed there as a temporary base for anti-submarine operations. The base was officially opened in February 1941, participating in the Empire Air Training Scheme as a mustering centre for airmen. Landscaping at this time included grassing over the parade ground and tree planting on Townsend Avenue. From September 1941 to February 1942 the base operated as No.2 Recruit Depot, with the aerodrome upgraded to provide for an operational base. In June 1941 5 bomb-dump buildings were erected and by October runways 1 and 3 (of 4) were extended. By November six aircraft dispersal bays had been constructed to the south of the site, each with two shelter hangars. Following the entry of the United States of America into the War, use of the base was transferred to Southern Area Command (RAAF) in January 1942. Formal administration of the base was taken over by American forces from May 1942 to September 1942. With the departure of the Central Gunnery School, No. 4 Operational Training Unit was raised in October 1942. At its peak, the base had some 888 personnel including 115 from the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). New lecture halls and test facilities, including gas chambers, were erected to complement the four Bellman hangars and five workshop hangars. Following the end of the War in the Pacific in August 1945, the number of personnel was rapidly reduced. At the end of 1945 the RAAF had 317 mainland and regional airfields. Of these some 12 were considered of strategic importance; Butterworth, Cocos Island, Momote, Darwin, Learmonth, Williamtown, Townsville, Pearce, East Sale, Richmond and Amberley. Willamtown became the peacetime base for the RAAF fighter wing. In August 1946 RAAF Williamtown became the base of 78 Fighter Wing. In November 1948 the School of Land/Air Warfare, a joint services training establishment was formed at Williamtown. Two army units, the parachute and air portability training wings, were attached to the School. A parachute tower and armament range were provided. In 1958 the School was renamed the Air Support Unit. In 1976 a new purpose-built facility, for the renamed Australia Joint Warfare Establishment, was completed at Williamtown. Between 1949 and 1951 involvement in the Korean War led to re-equipping with de Havilland Vampire jet fighter aircraft, with Williamtown the focus of RAAF training. Following the introduction of jet aircraft, the base was rebuilt from 1950 as funds became available. New works included a sealed, concrete runway 8,700 feet long at a cost of 750,000 pounds, the first to be constructed during post-war restructuring, and refueling facilities, to accommodate Gloster Meteors and the Sabre jet fighters from 1955, replaced in 1967 by the new Dassault Mirage III. During the 1950s and 1960s works included a new Control Tower (1958‚Äì1961), a new parachute tower, new bomb dump buildings, a compound of 16 Nissen Huts, new two-storey brick quarters for non-married officers and a second series of brick sleeping quarters for 532 airmen. As late as 1955 there were still some airmen accommodated in tents. Between 1959‚Äì1964 a number of Bellman hangars were relocated to the base. In addition 21 brick married quarters and 17 prefabricated married quarters were provided, the first erected west of Medowie Road at the edge of the base. This reflected the policy that homes should be provided for 40% of the established posts at each RAAF base. A modern brick officer's mess, swimming pool, water treatment plant, airmen's mess, ration store, airmen's laundry, NCO accommodation and mess, a chapel and street lighting completed the modernisation program. In 1965 a four-year program resulted in the construction of 3 new hangars, extensions and a new armaments workshop. In 1983 upgrade works commenced at RAAF Base Williamtown to support the new 75 F/A 18 aircraft, which replaced the Mirage by 1989. In 1988 RAAF Butterworth was downgraded, RAAF Base Williamtown becoming the new headquarters for the Tactical Fighter group. New facilities included headquarters buildings, hangars, workshops, stores, medical facilities and a base chapel. From 1997 new Defence development initiatives, under the Defence Reform Program, have resulted in planned changes to the base. The commercial operation south of the runways, implemented in the 1962‚Äì1994 period with the permission of the RAAF, was subsequently leased to the Newcastle Airport organisation in 1992.  Description  RAAF Base Williamtown buildings are at located at RAAF Base Williamtown, Medowie Road. The site consists of a number of buildings and structures = From the 1939‚Äì1945 period = Buildings and structures from the 1939‚Äì1945 period include: * Henderson Road and the road network for the original camp, comprising Eaton Road, Ford Road and Townsend Avenue west of McNamara Drive. * parade ground * Bellman hangars * four underground fuel tanks * dispersal taxiway associated with fuel tank * sections of Runways 1 and 4 * sub station and emergency powerhouse * tennis courts * pump house = From the post-war period to c. 1964 = After World War II, the base evolved in response to the location of the World War II infrastructure and buildings and the extended main runway of the 1950s, which was the dominant alignment and feature of the site. Buildings and structures from post-World War II period to circa 1964 include: * the main concrete runway, northern taxiways and hard standing area * additional Bellman hangars * explosives storage * control tower * stores * armament preparation units * original test butt * first airmen's brick dormitory block * officer's dormitories and the officers mess * airmen's dormitory block * brick married quarters = World War Two = In common with the former RAAF Base Fairbairn, Canberra, and other RAAF bases, the Williamtown facility was planned as a series of functional zones on a rectangular road grid, the parade ground forming a focus between the dormitory areas and messes and the workshops and hangars at the intersection of Townsend Avenue and Frost Street. Three prefabricated Bellman hangars are in their original location, defining the original aprons serving Runway No.1. Four underground fuel tanks have survived changes to the runway system as has a small section of the dispersal taxiway associated with a fuel tank and a short section of Runway 4 (1940). The alignments of Runways 1 and 4 are reflected in the intersection and alignment of Knox-Knight and Townsend Avenue. The road network south of Ford Road and west of, and including, McNamara Drive identifies the early camp and operations structures and the major alignments of the early runway system. Characteristically, extant buildings from this period are aligned with the road layout, sub-station and emergency powerhouse, Bellman hangars with sufficient structures and services remaining to illustrate the separation of functions and the wartime functioning of the base. The tennis courts provided for the NCOs and officers and the community hall (located in Williamtown Village) have also survived. The pump house is located within the site, as is the Hunter Water pumping station of the late 1930s, although it is not owned by Defence. The portable Bellman hangar, of which some 123 were made, was designed in England for quick dismantling and erection, and manufactured by Lysaghts of Newcastle. They were steel framed with a low-pitched roof covered with corrugated galvanised iron sheeting. The extension of the door supports beyond the shell of the building allowed maximum access to the usable spaces. The community hall and pump house were erected in the prevailing timber framed weatherboard vernacular style, with corrugated galvanized iron hipped roofs. The community hall features gablets to the main roof. = Post War to c. 1964 (pre Mirage 1965) = The main concrete runway and northern taxiways defined the focus of operations and built on the underlying planning with the addition of relocated Bellman hangars and new bomb dumps. The steel framed control tower replaced the earlier tower. In addition workshops, stores, explosive storage areas and armament preparation units were added. The original test butt for the early jet fighter aircraft, was constructed in in-situ reinforced concrete. The planning of sealed roads included Townsend, Henderson, Perrin and Knox-Knight Roads and the realigned Medowie Road. Henderson Road follows the original alignment of Medowie Road. The first airmen's brick dormitory block was erected in 1955 followed the alignments of the earlier road system. Noticeably, later dormitory buildings were arranged in a diagonal manner across the blocks. These included the officer's dormitory compound, the officers mess and airmen's brick dormitory blocks in the same area as the wartime camp. These units were erected to replace the hut style accommodation of the wartime and immediate post-war years. Brick married quarters were the first new married quarters erected (before 1954). The cottages are simple rectangular units with gabled, tiled roofs and generous windows. The lounge rooms feature gable wall fireplaces and chimneys. The first airmen's brick dormitory block (1955), the transient airmen's sleeping quarters, is H-shaped in plan, and comprises two two-storey gabled, pitched roof blocks with tiled roofs joined by a single storey, linking block. The later two-storey accommodation blocks are also gabled but with colorbond roofing. The first airmen's brick dormitory block features simple timber sash windows, but has some stylistic content in the projecting entrance porch, characteristic of the late 1950s and early 1960s. = Comparison = The road network for the original camp, comprising Eaton Road, Ford Road and Townsend Avenue west of McNamara Drive, was completed by 1945. Typically, the alignment of wartime and early post war buildings, such as the first airmen's brick dormitory block, was dictated by the road layout. As an operational wartime base from 1939‚Äì1945 the provision of Bellman hangars (demountable, prefabricated structures) followed established patterns, also used at RAAF Base Amberley which was developed at the same time. The hangar group typically interfaced between workshops and administration and taxiways and runways. Although individual bases, such as Fairbairn, Darwin, Amberley and Williamtown show differences in the degree of formal planning, they are organized on a similar functional basis, with the social hierarchy of the RAAF clearly reflected in the location, range and type of accommodation provided. The post-war development of RAAF Base Williamtown reinforced the functional planning of the wartime years. Brick accommodation units used at RAAF Base Richmond from 1935‚Äì1937 were used as models for the two-storey airman's brick dormitory block erected in 1955. The use of prefabricated housing units stemmed from post-war shortages of materials, which impacted on both the Australian Government and the private sector. The early brick and tile houses (the married quarters) clearly follow designs prepared by the Australian Government and used in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Canberra. = Condition = As at July 2002, all buildings and structures, with the possible exception of redundant underground fuel tanks and early runway remnants, appeared to be maintained in good order. = Integrity = The evolving landscape of the base represents three periods: * 1939‚Äì1945 World War II * 1946‚Äì1964 post World War II and the early jet age * 1965‚Äì1982 the Mirage jet fighter As at July 2002, the fabric relating to each of these periods or phases remains essentially intact to document changes in the landscape, which continues to express the original planning and layout of the base during the period 1939‚Äì1945. In common with operational changes on other RAAF bases, the Bellman hangars have been modified by the addition of extensions and have in most cases been reclad externally, although the structural frames remain intact. Of the in situ hangars, from 1939‚Äì1945, Hangar 172 is the most intact retaining the original sliding door systems intact. The parade gound is now used for car parking and is also used for small storage buildings.  Heritage listing  RAAF Base Williamtown buildings were listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. =Criterion A: Processes= The evolving landscape of RAAF Base Williamtown, comprising Henderson Road, the road network of the 1939‚Äì1945 camp, 1939‚Äì1945 buildings and structures (substation and emergency powerhouse, underground fuel tanks, parade ground, tennis courts, Bellman hangars, and associated taxiways, sections of runways 1 and 4 and the pump house) and post-war structures and buildings (the main runway and northern taxiways and hardstanding, additional Bellman hangars, married quarters, the first airmen's dormitory block, stores, test butt, armament preparation units, explosives storage, airmen's dormitory blocks, officer's dormitories, and control tower) is important as the operational and training focus for Australia's jet fighter aircraft. These include the Vampire (1949‚Äì1955), Sabre (1955‚Äì1964), Mirage (1965‚Äì1982) and F/A 18 Hornet (1983‚Äìpresent). Australia's involvement in the Korean War (1949‚Äì1951) promoted the development of the base, which in 1945, following the World War II (1939‚Äì1945), had been one of ten mainland RAAF bases considered strategically important to Australia's defence, as peacetime base for the RAAF fighter wing. In 1988 RAAF Base Williamtown became the Headquarters for the Tactical Fighter Group. The site was selected for the RAAF in August 1939, when the site was surveyed for an emergency landing ground, a significant factor in its selection being its proximity to Newcastle's steel mills and coal mines. The base is also significant for the use of limited resources through the New South Wales Government's Unemployment Relief Program and the completion of four runways in 1940. Officially opened in February 1941, the base is historically significant for its contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme as No. 2 Recruit Depot and as No. 4 Operational Training Unit between 1942 and 1945. The development of the base in the post-war years reinforced the importance of the peacetime role of RAAF Base Williamtown. This strategic role was reinforced in 1950 by the construction of the first concrete runway in Australia. The strategic role was also reflected in the construction of separate married quarters, reflecting the policy that homes should be provided for at least 40% of the established posts. New headquarters buildings and operational facilities, as well as accommodation for airmen and an equivalent investment in recreational facilities and messes, reinforced the strategic, peacetime role of RAAF Base Williamtown. The wartime and postwar development period 1939‚Äì1964, which saw the development of the underlying planning and the introduction of jet fighter aircraft, is the primary focus of this assessment. Criterion B: Rarity The main runway (1950) at RAAF Base Williamtown is of exceptional interest as the first concrete runway constructed in Australia, and as the dedicated operational focus of Australia's RAAF Fighter Wing. The Test Butts are of particular importance for their association with the early use of jet fighters by the RAAF. Criterion D: Characteristic values The street layout of the initial \\"camp area\\", including the grid pattern road layout, the alignment of Medowie Road (Henderson Road), Parade Ground, Bellman Hangars and the northern taxiway areas (including the alignment of runway 1 and part of the dispersal taxiway associated with runways 1 and 4) and the underground fuel tanks, are important in illustrating the principal functional characteristics of RAAF bases developed in the immediate pre-war years and the early years of the World War II. The Bellman hangars as a group, including in particular the World War 2 hangars, are important in illustrating the principal characteristics and uses of this wartime prefabricated hangar, which enabled the rapid development of RAAF facilities on many World War II RAAF bases. The married quarters and two storey accommodation blocks for officers and airmen (including officer's dormitories and the first airmen's brick dormitory block and officers' dormitory compound) are important in illustrating the approach to the provision of permanent, up-to-date brick housing from 1955, during the consolidation of the RAAF's peacetime role. Other buildings important in illustrating the principal characteristics of RAAF facilities developed in the 1950s and 1960s, including overall planning road layout and function, include the officers mess and the new workshops, stores and the armament preparation units. Criterion G: Social value RAAF base Williamtown is important to the RAAF and the wider community for its symbolic, cultural and social associations as Australia's dedicated RAAF fighter base. Criterion I: Indigenous tradition Indigenous and Natural values of national estate significance exist on this site.

Known for a bright, bold palette, his work often explores political, historical and cultural themes to surreal and realist effect. In a six-decade career marked by several distinct phases, Zabarsky's imaginative use of color, formal experimentation and commitment to narrative organization in both traditional and avant garde styles are hallmarks of his work. In an interview with the British philosophers Donald and Monica Skilling, he said, \\"I'm discovering history, or a narrative, within a painting, as I go along.\\" That sensibility is in keeping with what Boston Globe critic Robert Taylor defined as \\"urban, Jewish, introverted and lyrical,\\" which he credits to the artists championed by art dealer Boris Mirski, Boston's leading gallerist from 1944‚Äì79, and his NYC counterpart, Edith Halpert of the Downtown Gallery. This group included Zabarsky, fellow artist and wife Joyce Reopel, Hyman Bloom, Barbara Swan, Jack Levine, Marianna Pineda, Harold Tovish and others, who helped overcome Boston's conservative distaste for the avant-garde, occasionally female, and often Jewish artists later classified as Boston expressionists. Unique to New England, the art movement had lasting national and local influence, and is now in its third generation.  Background & education  The third of four children, and a first-generation Russian-American, Zabarsky was born in Worcester, MA in 1932 to Anna Pearl (n√©e Glazer) and Max, Lithuanian and Ukrainian immigrants respectively. Raised in Worcester's historic Green Island/Union Hill, an area settled by Lithuanian Jews attracted by the local industry, Zabarsky was twice orphaned by the age of 16. His older sister Goldie, a fashion merchandiser, took over as head of household, while his much elder brother, already living with a family of his own, worked as a commercial artist. Zabarsky started drawing and painting at an early age, and dreamed of becoming a cartoonist. By 17, his sights had turned to fine arts. He trained for one year with the artist and educator Leonard Baskin at the Worcester Art Museum School, alongside his future wife, painter and writer Joyce Reopel, and his childhood friend, printmaker Sidney Hurwitz. Drafted at 19, Zabarsky was stationed in Stuttgart, Germany during the Korean War. He married Reopel upon his return to the U.S. in 1955. They both enrolled at the Ruskin School of Drawing & Fine Arts, Oxford University where they remained until 1957. They returned to the U.S. for additional study, with Zabarsky later graduating from the School of Fine & Applied Arts at Boston University with a BFA in 1958, and from the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences at the University of Cincinnati with an MFA in 1960.Melvin J. Zabarsky Collection (AFC/2001/001/94006), Veterans History Project, American Folklife Center, Library of Congress  Career  = Early political work = M. Zabarsky, The Argentinian Cyclist, 1969-70. Oil on canvas, 50\\" x 54.\\" From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, Zabarsky's paintings featured political themes, semi-realist portraiture and stylized trompe l'oeil geometric backgrounds. Typically spotlighting cultural figures, such as Che Guevara in The Argentinian Cyclist (1969‚Äì70) or Massachusetts labor leader Arnold Dubin beside cameos of Paul Robeson and Jimmy Hoffa garnered attention. Still more potent was his work around civil rights, in paintings such as The Artist and the Assassin (1965), which featured an ailing Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, haunting Klansmen, and a wild horse. Atlantic Cortege, another in this series, spotlights an African American funeral centered on a coffin. Meanwhile, an earlier painting The Hanging of the Hare (1957‚Äì58) explored similar themes, but more allusively, by referencing D√ºrer's Young Hare watercolor. = Dada and still-life realism = By the 1970s, Zabarsky's geometry began to look more like still life, his palette lightened and edges softened. The eponymous Teeth on a Pedestal (1974) is one of several Dada or Absurdist pieces from this period, glorifying in teeth, or dentures, often posed beside a model of a muscular man. = Biblical themes = A Spanish sabbatical in the mid-80s moved Zabarsky toward more traditional European narrative styles. A multi-year exploration of Old Testament themes in representational style followed, and over the course of several paintings (e.g. Red Room [1975-76], The Garden [1980]) he accrued a large body of work collectively known as the Susannah and the Elders series. This formalism ceased with a trip to Japan in the early 1990s. His studio limitations there morphed his signature interest in geometry into looser, wilder collage. The change in technique affected his narrative voice and palette, which was suddenly dappled with vibrant yellow, streaks of purple and acid green. The sharp borders of earlier decades disappeared, and canvas was pasted upon canvas, with color extending past the painting onto the frame. More expressionist than realist, this work in aggregate was freer and more energetic than his earlier approach, as shown in The True Story of Prometheus (1997‚Äì98) and Tropical Tropism (1994). = History, Surrealism and Judaism = From 1999-2009, Zabarsky explored the Jewish self and the American and European other in the collection Surreal Histories. The collection distills themes into both a straightforward ‚Äúpublic history‚Äù of Ernest and Pauline Hemingway in Spain after the Spanish Civil War in Spanish Panorama (Hemingway‚Äôs Version) and the idiosyncratic ‚Äúpersonal history‚Äù Oslo Sun and Vienna Moon. The latter features bursts of bright color and a bold off-center composition that spans Edvard Munch‚Äôs The Scream, Sigmund and Anna Freud and the painter Balthus smashing through rich blues, crimsons, violets and sunny yellows to cross cultures, types and textures all gently bound together by the scrawled word ‚Äúcontemporaries.‚Äù = University work = Also an educator, Zabarsky taught art for nearly three decades at various institutions including the Swain School of Design, Wheaton College and the University of New Hampshire. At the latter, he also served as chair of the Department of Art and Art History, and helped found the Museum of Art and the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in painting.  Honors and awards  Zabarsky is the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including a Ford Foundation Grant in the Humanities, a Stone Foundation Fellowship for work in Italy, a National Institute of Arts & Letters nomination and prizes at the Boston Arts Festival.  Exhibitions  His solo exhibitions include shows at Kyoto's Rew Dex Gallery, Madrid's Salones Berkowitsch and Circulo de Bellas Artes.. In the U.S., he had one-person shows at the DeCordova Museum & Sculpture Park, the Wheaten Beard & Weil Galleries, formerly known as the Watson Gallery, the Boris Mirski Gallery and Edith Halbert's Downtown Gallery.  Public collections  His paintings and drawings can be found in many public institutions, including MOMA, the Museum of Art, Ein Harod (Israel), the Wiggins Collection at the Boston Public Library, the Addison Gallery of American Art, the Currier Gallery of Art, Williams College Museum of Art, Keene State College, University Museum of Contemporary Art (Amherst, MA), the Danforth Museum and the Museum of Art at the University of New Hampshire.

Converted into an armed merchantman during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, she played a crucial role in the Battle of Tsushima. Although used as a hospital ship during World War II, she was sunk by the United States Navy in 1944 with great loss of civilian lives. History =Background= Asano S≈çichir≈ç, owner of the Asano zaibatsu, decided that he wished to create a shipping company, and founded T≈çy≈ç Kisen in July 1896. With the assistance of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, orders were placed with the Wigham Richardson shipyards at Newcastle upon Tyne in England for three vessels. Asano's stipulation was that the vessels have the clean, sharp lines of clipper ships, and were to be painted white. Up until this time, Japanese shipping companies mainly concentrated on local traffic with China. However, Asano intended to compete against the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Canadian Pacific, and other foreign shippers on trade to India and Europe, as well as North America. America Maru was laid down in March 1897, launched on March 9, 1898 and completed on September 24 of the same year. =Early civilian service= On her maiden voyage, America Maru called at Hong Kong ‚Äì Xiamen-Shanghai ‚Äì Nagasaki ‚Äì Yokohama ‚Äì Kobe and on to Honolulu and San Francisco. With her sister ships, Nippon Maru and Hong Kong Maru, she was placed into scheduled services on the north Pacific Route. Upon docking in Honolulu in October 1899, America Maru was suspected of bringing rats with the bubonic plague to Hawaii and was placed in quarantine by American authorities. In an effort to control the epidemic, Honolulu's Chinatown was burned down. In December 1900, noted author and physician Hideyo Noguchi travelled to the United States aboard America Maru. In June 1901, after Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen's revolt against the Qing dynasty failed, he fled to Japan aboard America Maru, which was in Tianjin conveying supplies to Japanese forces involved in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. =Service in the Russo-Japanese War= With the start of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, America Maru was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy for use as an armed merchant cruiser and began conversion at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 15 February 1904. However, a fire aboard the ship caused severe damage, and she was not ready for use until February 1905. Under the command of Captain Ishibashi Hajime in April 1905, she was based at Tsushima Island as one of seven armed merchantmen and three torpedo boat tenders assigned to patrols of the Tsushima Strait to search for the Russian Baltic Fleet, which had been dispatched around the world to relieve the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. On the night of May 26‚Äì27 , America Maru, and were deployed as a lookout screen in the strait between Got≈ç Islands and Jeju-do. Shinano Marus early contact with the Russian fleet was a major contributing factor in the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima. After the battle, America Maru located the sinking wreckage of the Russian protected cruiser and rescued 291 survivors. =Post-war civilian service= After the war America Maru reverted to civilian use, and was assigned in November 1908 to the Japan ‚Äì South America routes. On September 20, 1911, Toyo Kisen sold America Maru for 367,000 Yen to Osaka Sh≈çsen K.K., which operated the vessel between Kobe, Japan and Keeling, Taiwan. She was damaged by a typhoon while docked at Kobe on September 21, 1934 =World War II= After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, America Maru was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Army as a hospital ship. In accordance with the International Red Cross and international norms, she was painted white with prominent red crosses on her funnels, and an official notice was sent to all belligerent countries by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She was chartered by the Imperial Japanese Navy on January 12, 1944. On May 14, 1944, while attempting to evacuate Japanese civilians, mostly women and children, from Saipan to Yokosuka, Kanagawa, she was hit by two torpedoes fired by the United States Navy submarine south-southwest of Iwo Jima (). Of her complement of 602 (511 civilians, 4 military, 87 crewmen), only 43 civilians were rescued. Contemporary Japanese press labeled the sinking of a clearly marked hospital ship carrying civilians as a war crime. However, it had been reverted to a transport ship in December 1943, and was known to have carried munitions via radio intercepts.Lotz, Dave.

It was founded by Raymond Orteig in 1902. The hotel was particularly known for its restaurant, the Caf√© Lafayette, and drew its clientele from New York's French expatriates and the bohemians of Greenwich Village. John Reed described the hotel as \\"the real link between the old Village and the new, since it was the cradle of artistic life in New York.\\" After Orteig's retirement in 1929, the 65-room hotel and its restaurant were run by his sons until its closure in 1949. The building was demolished in the late 1950s. History The Hotel Lafayette began its life as Hotel Martin. In 1883 Jean-Baptiste Martin, who had previously run a hotel in Panama bought a small pension on University Place run by Eugene Larru and opened it under the name Hotel de Panama. Three years later he changed its name to Hotel Martin. According to Martin, he decided on the name change because: \\"Panama gave people a bad impression. They associated it with fever and Spaniards, and neither were popular.\\" In the ensuing years Martin took over the adjoining houses and built extensions until the small pension became a large building. Advertisement for the Hotel Martin from the late 1880s A late 1880s advertisement for the Martin described it as \\"the only first-class French hotel in New York.\\" In addition to the artists and writers of Greenwich Village, the Martin's clients over the years included the opera singers Jean and √âdouard de Reszke, Pol Plan√ßon and Nelly Melba as well as the painter Th√©obald Chartran, the violinist Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, and the French statesman Jules Cambon. At the turn of the 20th century, Martin decided to open a restaurant on 26th Street near Madison Square Park and in 1902 sold the hotel's lease to Raymond Orteig who had been the head-waiter at the Caf√© Martin. Orteig immediately renamed it Hotel Lafayette after General Lafayette, the French aristocrat and military officer who had fought in the American Revolutionary War. However, for many years the Lafayette remained informally known as \\"Old Martin's\\". Orteig retained the Hotel Martin's French restaurant which had its own entrance on the corner of University Place and 9th Street. Rechristened Caf√© Lafayette, it had a tile floor and marble-topped tables, some of which were placed outside on warm days and was stocked with foreign newspapers and board games. Adjoining it were a more formal restaurant where an orchestra played in the evening and several private dining rooms. Orteig subscribed to the Paris weekly Brasserie Universelle and introduced its latest dishes in his restaurant. The Lafayette was particularly known for its mixed hors d'oeuvres, squab in casserole, filet mignon in bearnaise sauce, and pears flamed in a secret blend of French liqueurs. A bust of General Lafayette by Houdon was displayed in the hotel lobby, and from the late 1920s, the foyer was decorated with memorabilia from Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight in the Spirit of St. Louis from New York to Paris. It was the first solo transatlantic flight and the first non-stop flight between North America and the European mainland. In the process Lindbergh won the Orteig Prize. Raymond Orteig first became interested in aviation during World War I and its immediate aftermath when the Lafayette became a favorite gathering place for American and French airmen. The American flag which Lindbergh had carried on his flight had hung on the wall of the Caf√© Lafayette until November 1941. At that point Orteig's son moved it to a private office in the hotel, explaining to The New York Times: \\"Too many pros and cons. Particularly for a restaurant. The flag hung there since 1927 when Lindbergh was an aviator and everyone was proud of him. But now he's talking politics. And lately when people noticed the flag a discussion began.\\" After his retirement in 1929, Orteig's three sons, Raymond Jr., Jean Blaise, and Evariste ran the Lafayette until its closure in 1949. Their father died in 1939. Closure The Lafayette's building was owned by the Sailors' Snug Harbor Trust. When the building's lease came up for renewal in 1949, the Orteig brothers were unable to negotiate terms with the Snug Harbor trustees which would have kept the Layfayette economically viable. The hotel and its restaurant closed on 31 March 1949, when the last dinner was served at the Caf√© Lafayette. Among the last hotel guests to check out were the author Elliot Paul and the artist Niles Spencer. Among the last-night diners who had filled the caf√© were actor Winston Ross, cartoonist Dorothy McKay, producer Gilbert Miller, and Lady Hubert Wilkins who was writing an article on the Lafayette's closure for Australian Consolidated Press. That evening several of the caf√©'s habitu√©s bought items from the hotel, including its barber pole. The remainder of the Lafayette's fixtures and furnishings were sold during a three-day auction which began on 26 April. In October 1949, New York University Law School took out a short-term lease on the old Lafayette building to rehouse tenants from a nearby apartment house which they were planning to demolish to make way for a new law center. The Lafayette building itself was demolished in 1957 to make way for a 12-storey apartment building.

Sethu Mannarkkad produced the film under the banner of Full Moon Cinema. The film was released on 21 December 2018 to highly positive reviews. At the box office, it grossed ‚Çπ52 crore worldwide in 40 days into release, becoming one of the highest-grossing Malayalam films of all time. Plot The story of a man named Prakashan who yearns to go to foreign countries, particularly Germany. He finds that his name is a bit old-fashioned so changes his name to P. R. Akash just to sound more modern. Though qualified as a nurse, he vehemently opposes the idea of entering the nursing profession because of its lower pay and thankless nature. He shows a sexist view toward this career, believing that it is suited to women rather than men. He actively tries to go abroad by marrying a foreign citizen and thus acquiring a family visa, followed by dumping her and living his life. As a foundation for his plan, he tries his hand at rekindling an old flame with his ex-girlfriend Salomi despite the fact that she is a nurse. Salomi is on the verge of migrating to Germany for significantly higher wages. He digresses from his original plan to start fresh, and tries to re-ignite his unfulfilled love with Salomi, learns German and foresees Germany as his final destination. He confides in his local guardian Gopalji, a former student of his father, that the affection showered on Salomi was a lie so that he could obtain a visa in conjunction with the existing emigration rules. However, when Prakashan visits them later, he discovers that they still require a significant amount of money for the visa. Though they were planning to mortgage their house, they need the signature of Salomi's aunt, who is practicing in Italy as a nun and will not return to Kerala. Consequently, he sells his motorbike and persuades Gopalji to steal a necklace from his wife, which gets Gopalji into trouble with the police. Ironically, Salomi cheats Prakashan along with her family and manages to use him for money to get to Germany. There, she marries a German citizen to remain in the country. Realizing that she exploited him and his family, Prakashan leaves his visa acquiring scam then and there and stays in Kerala. He then works doing manual labor for Gopalji to repay his debt for the necklace, and later resorts to a related profession of a home nurse. He takes up the job with Tina Mol, the feisty daughter of a rich mother, who loves junk food. Though initially she sets her dog loose on him after he refused to let her friend Shruthi deliver a burger, they develop a remarkably close relationship. Prakashan also develops a romantic interest for Shruti. During a discussion where Tina expresses her desire to meet her father before dying, Prakashan tells her that she has her whole life ahead of her to do so. She then reveals to him that she is terminally ill with a malignant brain cyst, at which point she starts bleeding from the ear. After her family doctor treats her, Prakashan recounts a similar case in America where a terminally ill cancer patient was cured just by laughing and enjoying his life - he thus tries to improve her quality of life through inviting her schoolmates over, playing badminton with her and so on. However, Tina unexpectedly dies during one of Prakashan's stories despite his efforts to revive her. This has a profound impact on him, with Prakashan transforming himself into a realistic and grounded human being, a sensitive nursing professional where he realizes that nursing is more than just a way of income, but rather, a way to help people in need.

Music The film score was composed by Shaan Rahman,in his first collaboration with Sathyan Anthikad . Release The film was released on 21 December 2018. =Box office= The film grossed nearly ‚Çπ20 crore from Kerala box office with a distributor's share of ‚Çπ8.9 crore, as of 9 January 2019. In overseas, the film grossed $12,080 in Australia and $19,390 in New Zealand in the opening weekend (3 days). In three weekends, it grossed $23,302 and $29,177 in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. It grossed ¬£26,772 from 28 sites in the United Kingdom in the opening weekend.

In six weekends, it grossed $272,945 (‚Çπ1.96 crore) in the US. With a total of $278,000, Njan Prakashan became the highest- grossing Malayalam film in the US, surpassing Pulimurugan ($258,000). The film earned a global theatrical revenue of 52 crore in 40 days, becoming one of the highest-grossing Malayalam films of all time. =Critical response= Sajin Shrijith of The New Indian Express rated 4 in a scale of 5 and wrote: \\"Njan Prakashan is a laugh-out-loud comedy, and has more than enough to satisfy anyone looking for two hours of pure entertainment; but since this is a film about life, a couple of dark moments are to be expected ... Thankfully, Anthikad keeps the film free of old-fashioned melodrama\\". Anjana George of The Times of India rated 4 out of 5 stars and wrote: \\"As PR Akash transforms to Prakashan and realises the beauty of life and God‚Äôs own country, we will definitely welcome back Sreenivasan and Sathyan Anthikad, whose films even after three decades manage to encapsulate the Malayali psyche\\". Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost gave 4 out of 5 stars and said: \\"Njan Prakashan inhabits familiar Anthikad territory yet within the familiar, the director manages to unearth the refreshing and the new. It is hard to explain what the film is about because it is not about anything in particular, yet it is about anything that matters - life, death and the relationships that come in between\\". S. R. Praveen of The Hindu wrote: \\"movie sticks faithfully to the Antikad ‚Äì Sreenivasan playbook ... while Njan Prakashan might satisfy those who yearn for more of the same from the 90s' Sathyan-Sreeni world, it would be a disappointment for those looking for novelty\\". Sify's critic rated 2.5 in a scale of 5, writing \\"Njan Prakashan has a shaky first half but a relatively more convincing second half ... There are some laughs in the beginning but the comedy becomes predictable and the situations become less interesting ... Sreenivasan‚Äôs script lacks the punch of some of his gems from the past and this one becomes a rehash of a few of Sathyan Anthikad‚Äôs own earlier movies\\". Cris from The News Minute wrote: \\"All the characters are written superficially, without any depth or originality.

Open problems in fair cake-cutting  = Query complexity of envy-free cake-cutting = In the problem of envy-free cake-cutting, there is a cake modeled as an interval, and n agents with different value measures over the cake. The value measures are accessible only via queries of the form \\"evaluate a given piece of cake\\" or \\"mark a piece of cake with a given value\\". With n=2 agents, an envy-free division can be found using two queries, via divide and choose. With n>2 agents, there are several open problems regarding the number of required queries. 1\\\\. First, assume that the entire cake must be allocated (i.e., there is no disposal), and pieces may be disconnected. How many queries are required? * Lower bound: \\\\Omega(n^2); * Upper bound: O\\\\left(n^{n^{n^{n^{n^{n}}}}}\\\\right). 2\\\\. Next, assume that some cake may be left unallocated (i.e., there is free disposal), but the allocation must be proportional (in addition to envy-free): each agent must get at least 1/n of the total cake value. Pieces may still be disconnected. How many queries are required? * Lower bound: not known (theoretically it may be polynomially solvable). *Upper bound: (n!)^2 n^2. 3\\\\. Next, assume there is free disposal, the allocation must still be proportional, but the pieces must be connected. How many queries are required? * For n=3, there is an algorithm with 54 queries. * For n\\\\geq 4, no finite algorithm is currently known. 4\\\\. Next, assume there is free disposal, the pieces must be connected, but the allocation may be only approximately proportional (i.e., some agents may get less than 1/n of the total cake value). What value can be guaranteed to each agent using a finite envy-free protocol? * For n=3, there is an algorithm that attains 1/3, which is optimal. *For n=4 (the smallest open case), there is an algorithm that attains 1/7. * For any n, there is an algorithm that attains 1/(3n). 5\\\\. Finally, assume the entire cake must be allocated, and pieces may be disconnected, but the number of cuts (or number of pieces per agent) should be as small as possible. How many cuts do we need in order to find an envy- free allocation in a finite number of queries? * For n\\\\geq 3, a finite algorithm does not exist for n-1 cuts (1 piece per agent). * For n=3, Selfridge‚ÄìConway procedure solves the problem in finite time with 5 cuts (and at most 2 pieces per agent). * For n\\\\geq 4, the Aziz-Mackenzie procedure solves the problem in finite time, but with many cuts (and many pieces per agent). * Smallest open case: three agents and 3 or 4 cuts; four agents and 2 pieces per agent. = Number of cuts for cake-cutting with different entitlements = When all agents have equal entitlements, a proportional cake- cutting can be implemented using n-1 cuts, which is optimal. How many cuts are required for implementing a proportional cake-cutting among n agents with different entitlements? * Lower bound: 2n-2; * Upper bound: 3n-4. * Smallest open case: n=3 agents with all different entitlements: 1/7, 2/7 and 4/7. How many cuts are required for implementing an envy-free cake-cutting among n agents with different entitlements? * Lower bound: 2n-2, since envy-free implies proportional. *Upper bound: not known. = Fair division of a partly burnt cake = A partly burnt cake is a metaphor to a cake in which agents may have both positive and negative valuations. A proportional division of such a cake always exists. :What is the runtime complexity of calculating a connected-proportional allocation of partly burnt cake? Known cases: * When all valuations are positive, or all valuations are negative, the Even-Paz protocol finds a connected proportional division using O(n\\\\log n) queries, and this is optimal. * When valuations may be mixed, a moving-knife protocol can be used to find a connected proportional division using O(n^2) queries. Can this be improved to O(n\\\\log n) ? An envy-free division of a partly burnt cake is guaranteed to exist if-and-only-if the number of agents is the power of a prime integer. However, it cannot be found by a finite protocol - it can only be approximated. Given a small positive number D, an allocation is called D-envy-free if, for each agent, the allocation will become envy-free if we move the cuts by at most D (length units). : What is the runtime complexity (as a function of D) of calculating a connected D-envy-free allocation of a partly burnt cake? = Truthful cake-cutting = Truthful cake-cutting is the design of truthful mechanisms for fair cake-cutting. The currently known algorithms and impossibility results are shown here. The main cases in which it is unknown whether a deterministic truthful fair mechanism exists are: * There are 3 or more agents with piecewise-uniform valuations, without free disposal. * There are 2 or more agents with piecewise-constant valuations, with or without free disposal (and without additional requirements such as connectivity or non-wastefulness).  Open problems in fair allocation of indivisible items = Approximate maximin-share fairness = The 1-of-n maximin share (MMS) of an agent is the largest utility the agent can secure by partitioning the items into n bundles and receiving the worst bundle. For two agents, divide and choose gives each agent at least his/her 1-of-2 MMS. For n>2 agents, it is almost always, but not always, possible to give each agent his/her 1-of-n MMS. This raises several kinds of questions.  1. Computational complexity  What is the runtime complexity of deciding whether a given instance admits a 1-of-n MMS allocation? * Upper bound: {NP}^{NP} (which is \\\\Sigma_2^P  level 2 in the polynomial hierarchy) *Lower bound: none (so it may be level 2 or 1 or even 0 of the hierarchy). NOTE: the following related problems are known to be computationally hard: *Calculating the 1-of-n MMS of a given agent is NP-hard even if all agents have additive preferences (reduction from partition problem). * Deciding whether a given allocation is 1-of-n MMS is co-NP complete for agents with additive preferences.  2. Cardinal approximation  :What is the largest fraction r such that there always exists an allocation giving each agent a utility of at least r times his 1-of-n maximin share? Known cases: * For two agents: r=1 by divide-and-choose. * For three agents, even with additive valuations: r<1. By a carefully crafted example. * For any number of agents with additive valuations: r\\\\ge 3/4. *For any number of agents with additive negative valuations (i.e., for chores): r\\\\ge 9/11.  3. Ordinal approximation  :What is the smallest integer N (as a function of n) such that there always exists an allocation among n agents giving each agent at least his 1-of-N MMS? Known cases: * For two agents: N=2. By divide-and-choose. *For any number of agents with binary valuations: N=n. By round-robin. It gives EF1, which implies 1-of-n-MMS. * For n>2 agents: N>n. By a carefully crafted example. * For any number of agents with additive valuations: N\\\\le 2n-1, by round-robin. It gives EF1, which implies 1-of-(2n-1)-MMS. *For any number of agents with additive valuations: N\\\\le 2n-2, using envy-free matching. So the answer can be anything between n+1 and 2n-2, inclusive. Smallest open case: :For n=4 agents with additive valuations, does there always exist a 1-of-5 maximin-share allocation? Note: there always exists an Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes that guarantees the 1-of-(n+1) maximin-share. However, this allocation may have excess supply, and - more importantly - excess demand: the sum of the bundles allocated to all agents might be slightly larger than the set of all items. Such an error is reasonable when allocating course seats among students, since a small excess supply can be corrected by adding a small number of seats. But the classic fair division problem assumes that items may not be added. = Envy-free up to one item = An allocation is called EF1 (envy-free up to one item) if, for any two agents i and j, and for any subset of size at most one contained in the bundle of j, if we remove that subset from j's bundle then i does not envy. An EF1 allocation always exists and can be found by the envy cycles algorithm. Combining it with other properties raises some open questions.  Pareto-optimal EF1 allocation (goods and bads)  When all items are good and all valuations are additive, a PO+EF1 always exists: the allocation maximizing the product of utilities is PO+EF1. Finding this maximizing allocation is NP-hard, but in theory, it may be possible to find other PO+EF1 allocations (not maximizing the product). What is the run-time complexity of finding a PO+EF1 allocation of goods? A PO+EF1 allocation of bads (chores) is not known to exist, even when all valuations are additive. Does a PO+EF1 allocation of bads always exist? What is the run- time complexity of finding such allocation, if it exists?  Contiguous EF1 allocation  Often the goods are ordered on a line, for example, houses in a street. Each agent wants to get a contiguous block. :For three or more agents with additive valuations, does an EF1 allocation always exist? Known cases: * For two agents with additive valuations, the answer is yes: we can round a connected envy-free cake-cutting (e.g., found by divide and choose). * For n agents with additive valuations, we can find an \\"EF minus 2\\" allocation by rounding a connected envy-free cake-cutting, and there also exists an EF2 allocation (proof using a variant of Sperner's lemma). * For n agents with additive binary valuations (every item value is either 0 or 1), an \\"EF minus 2\\" allocation is also EF1, so the answer is yes. Even when a contiguous EF1 allocation exists, the runtime complexity of finding it is unclear: :For three or more agents with binary additive valuations, what is the complexity of finding a contiguous EF1 allocation? * A connected envy-free cake-cutting might take infinitely many queries to find. An EF1 allocation can always be found in finite time by checking all possible allocations, but this algorithm requires exponential run-time.  Price of fairness  The price of fairness is the ratio between the maximum social welfare (sum of utilities) in any allocation, and the maximum social welfare in a fair allocation. What is the price of EF1 fairness? * The upper bound is O(n)  by either Round-robin or maximum Nash welfare. * The lower bound is O(\\\\sqrt n). = Existence of EFx allocation = An allocation is called EFx (\\"envy-free up to any good\\") if, for any two agents i and j, and for any good in the bundle of j, if we remove that good from j's bundle then i does not envy. :For three agents with additive valuations, does there always exist an EFx allocation? :For n agents with general monotone valuations, can we prove that there does not exist an EFx allocation? Known cases: * If at least n-1 valuations are identical: yes. * Hence, for two agents: yes. This is true even for general monotone valuations. *For three agents: yes, by a recent working paper. = Existence of Pareto-efficient PROPx allocation of bads = An allocation of bads is called PROPx (aka FSx) if, for any agent i, and for any bad owned by i, if we remove that bad from i's bundle, then i's disutility is less than 1/n the total disutility. Does there always exist an allocation of bads that is both PROPx and Pareto-efficient? Related known cases: * A PROPx allocation of goods (even without Pareto-efficiency) may not exist. * A PROPx allocation of bads (without Pareto-efficiency) always exists. * A PROP1 and Pareto-efficient allocation of either goods or bads always exists. = Competitive equilibrium for almost all incomes = Competitive equilibrium (CE) is a very strong fairness notion - it implies Pareto-optimality and envy-freeness. When the incomes are equal, CE might not exist even when there are two agents and one good. But, in all other income-space, CE exists when there are two agents and one good. In other words, there is a competitive equilibrium for almost all income-vectors. :For two agents with additive valuations over any number of goods, does there exist a competitive equilibrium for almost incomes? Known cases: * With three or fewer goods: always yes. * With four goods: yes for 2 agents with general valuations, no for 3 agents with general valuations, no for 4 agents, even with additive valuations. * With five or more goods: no for two agents with general valuations. Open conjectures: * When there are two agents with additive valuations, CE for almost all incomes exists for any number of goods. * When there are three agents, even with additive valuations, CE for almost all incomes might not exist.  Fair division of partly divisible items  = Runtime complexity of fair allocation with bounded sharing = Given n\\\\geq 2 agents, m items and an integer k, suppose at most k items can be shared among two or more agents. What is the runtime complexity of deciding whether a proportional / envy-free allocation exists? Known cases: * With k=0 and identical valuations, for any n\\\\geq 2, the problem is equivalent to the partition problem, and therefore it is NP-complete. * With k\\\\geq n-1, the answer is always \\"yes\\", and an allocation can be found in polynomial time. * With n=3 and k=1 and identical valuations, an allocation can be found in polynomial time iff it exists. Smallest open cases: * n=3 and k=1 and different valuations. * n=4 and k\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} and identical valuations.

On 5 October, they were told that they would be sent to Switzerland in exchange for German prisoners of war. Instead, the train went to Auschwitz concentration camp where all were murdered in gas chambers. The reason for the unusual route of the transport is still debated by scholars; it is believed to be connected to Nazi‚ÄìJewish negotiations ongoing at the time and the intervention of Mohammad Amin al-Husseini, who feared that the children would settle in Palestine. Background =Bia≈Çystok Ghetto= The Bia≈Çystok Ghetto was established in 1941, following the murder of 7,000 Jews from Bia≈Çystok and surrounding areas by Einsatzgruppe B, Police Battalion 309, and Police Battalion 316. In February 1943, 8,000 Jews were deported from the ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp and another 2,000 were executed in the ghetto. On 16 August 1943, the final liquidation of the ghetto began. Although some Jews revolted, Police Regiment 26 (largely composed of Ukrainian collaborators) and other German forces crushed the uprising. Between 17 and 23 August, more than 25,000 Jews were deported to Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau. =Negotiations= It is still unclear how the Bia≈Çystok children fit into the larger scheme of Nazi-Jewish negotiations ongoing at the time. The Bratislava Working Group, an underground Jewish organization in Axis-aligned Slovakia, was at the time negotiating indirectly with Heinrich Himmler in hopes of ransoming the lives of all European Jews. In early 1943, Swiss diplomat Anton Feldscher forwarded a British proposal to the German Foreign Office to allow 5,000 Jewish children to escape from the General Government to Palestine via Sweden. Working Group member Andrej Steiner testified after the war that Dieter Wisliceny, the Working Group's liaison to the SS hierarchy, had told him in 1943 that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husseini, had intervened to prevent the rescue of the children, since he did not want them to go to Palestine. Wisliceny appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials. He claimed that his superiors, Adolf Eichmann and Himmler, were in favor of exchanging Polish Jewish children for prisoners of war. For this purpose, 10,000 children were to be transferred to Theresienstadt. However, due to the objections of the Mufti, the plan had to be abandoned. Eichmann stated at his trial that when Himmler canceled the operation, he forbade any consideration of plans to resettle Jews in Palestine. The intervention of the Mufti is considered by historians Sara Bender and Tobiasz Cyton to be the decisive factor leading to the murder of the children. According to Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, it is most likely that both the Bia≈Çystok children and the establishment of the Theresienstadt family camp were connected to the Feldscher proposal; in both cases the victims were temporarily kept alive in case they could be exchanged later, but murdered when the ransom failed to materialize. Bauer also states that Himmler's motivation to engage in negotiations was related to his belief that a Jewish conspiracy controlled the Allied governments; using Jewish children, he hoped to manipulate Allied leaders to his own advantage as it became clear that Germany would lose the war. The transport Liquidation of the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto On 17 August, the first day of the deportations, about 2,000 children were gathered near the train station waiting to be deported. The Germans separated them from their parents and housed them, along with 400 children from two Jewish orphanages in Bia≈Çystok, during the chaotic liquidation of the ghetto. Rumors circulated that the children would be exchanged for German prisoners of war and sent to safety in Switzerland. Some parents gave up their children voluntarily, hoping to save their lives. Other families were separated by force; survivors testified that Ukrainian auxiliaries murdered some children who tried to run back to their parents. Held in a former gymnasium, the children were treated well on the orders of Fritz Gustav, head of the Bia≈Çystok Gestapo, who stated \\"These children are mine!\\" However, German troops accidentally shelled the building on 18 August, killing a few dozen children. On 20 August, some 1,200 children between four and fourteen and a few dozen adult chaperones were marched separately to the Umschlagplatz, where they were given only a small amount of dried bread and no water, despite the heat. Probably on 21 August, the children and caregivers boarded a special train that arrived at Theresienstadt concentration camp three days later. It is unclear whether the train was composed of freight cars, as was typically the case during the Holocaust, or passenger cars. The conditions on the train were relatively good and after a while the children began to forget the horrors of the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto, although some of the older children asked the chaperones if they should jump from the trains. According to Helena Wolkenberg, a surviving chaperone, she told the children that they should only jump if the train went northwards, but it went west. It is not known whether the route taken was Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìAuschwitz‚ÄìTheresienstadt‚ÄìAuschwitz or Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìTheresienstadt‚ÄìAuschwitz. If the former, it is possible that the youngest children were taken off the train and gassed at Auschwitz. According to Israeli historian Bronka Klibanski, the train halted at Auschwitz before its arrival at Theresienstadt, where 20 children and 3 female caregivers who held valid Palestinian visas were removed from the train and killed in the gas chambers. On 24 August 1943, the transport arrived at Theresienstadt and the chaperones were separated from the children, except for one young woman who was disguised as a child, and put on a different train. The chaperones continued to Auschwitz, where about twenty were selected for forced labor and the rest gassed. At Theresienstadt March of the Bia≈Çystok children by Pavel Fantel At Theresienstadt, the children were kept inside the trains for some time. Some prisoners of the camp were ordered to bring the children food but were forbidden to speak to them. Despite the fact that Theresienstadt was a concentration camp where more than 30,000 people died, the residents were shocked by the poor condition of the children, starving and dressed in ragged clothes; many were shoeless. Because the Germans wanted to prevent the Theresienstadt prisoners from learning about Treblinka and other extermination camps, they forbade the Theresienstadt prisoners from going outside or even looking out of windows while the children were marched to the disinfection building by a large group of SS men. The precautions taken mystified Theresienstadt prisoners, since no other transport had been segregated nor been composed exclusively of children. Theresienstadt prisoners drew at least five images depicting the children marching through the streets. Upon reaching the disinfection rooms, some children panicked when their hair was cut and they were asked to undress, believing that they were about to be gassed; they were said to have shouted \\"Gas! Gas! Gas!\\" Older children tried to shield younger ones and they refused to undress and wash despite their poor clothing and lice. Although forbidden to speak with the children, the disinfection personnel were able to surreptitiously reassure them that there were no gas chambers at Theresienstadt, and the children calmed down when they noticed that water came out of the showers. Despite the language barrier‚Äîmost of the children spoke Polish or Yiddish‚Äîthey told the Theresienstadt prisoners about mass shootings in Bia≈Çystok and the use of gas chambers for mass murder. The incident, although not well understood by the other residents of Theresienstadt, was one of the few clues to the ultimate fate of those deported from the camp. The children were housed in the western barracks, separated from the rest of the camp by a barbed-wire fence. Czech gendarmes guarded the perimeter and kept the children strictly segregated from the rest of the camp. Attempting to find out more about the rumors of gas chambers, Fredy Hirsch, a community leader at Theresienstadt, jumped over the fence to speak with the Bia≈Çystok children but was caught. As punishment, he was deported to Auschwitz in September. The children were not registered into the records of the camp. The Bia≈Çystok children were held in relatively good conditions and given extra food by the Germans. It was rumored that they were to be taken to Switzerland to be exchanged for German prisoners of war, although some suspected that it was a trick. Fifty-three Czech volunteers, mostly doctors and nurses, were allowed to cross the barrier to attend to them. The volunteers, among them Ottla Kafka, were isolated with the Bia≈Çystok children and not allowed any contact with the Theresienstadt prisoners. Some sick children may have been murdered at the Theresienstadt Small Fortress or in an infirmary. On 5 October, 1,196 children and the 53 chaperones were put on a train and told that they were to be sent to Switzerland. They were told to remove the Star of David that Jews were forced to wear and forced to sign pledges that they would not spread information about Nazi atrocities. The train arrived at Auschwitz two days later; everyone was gassed immediately. Legacy The transport has been cited as an example of the Mufti's culpability in the Holocaust, despite the fact that his role in the events remains unclear. In 2014, the story of the Bia≈Çystok children was commemorated by a German play, Sie hatten so ver√§ngstigte Augen (\\"They had such fear in their eyes\\") directed by Markus Schuliers.

It was first described in 1901 by Wehmer, Wehmer 1901, Mem. Soc. Phys. Gen√®ve 33(2): 85 and is one of six Aspergillus species from the Clavati section of the subgenus Fumigati. Its closest taxonomic relatives are Aspergillus rhizopodus (Rai et al., 1975) and Aspergillus longivescia (Huang and Raper, 1971).  Morphology  Macro- and microscopic morphology of A. giganteus. A) colonies after growing for 7 days; B-C) conidiophores with blue-green heads; D-I) microscopic view of condiophores; J) conidia Like the majority of Aspergillus species, A. giganteus reproduces asexually, and has not been observed in a sexual state. Similar to other species in Clavati, A. giganteus produces numerous conidiophores that are characterized by glassy and translucent stem-like structures called stipes and club-shaped aspergilla that taper towards the tips. Blue-green colored asexual spores called conidia form on these tips. On a macroscopic level, A. giganteus colonies are characterized by their velvety texture. Colonies are often white at first, turning a pale blue-green color when exposed to light. Morphology of Aspergillus conidiophore head On a microscopic level, A. giganteus produces two tipes of conidiophores that have distinct stipes and vesicles. The first of these conidiophores are typically 2-3 mm tall, including stipe length. These shorter conidiophores produces clavate vesicles that are 100-250 Œºm long and 30-50 Œºm wide. The second type of conidiophores are much larger, approximately 1-5 cm long. Most of this length is due to elongated stipes. These more elongated conidiophores are phototropic, meaning that they are only able to develop and grow in the presence of light. The vesicles produced by the long conidiophores are 400-600 Œºm long and 120-180 Œºm wide, more than double the size of the vesicles produced by their shorter counterparts. Together the vesicle and phialides form the conidial head. In A. giganteus, these heads are blue-green in color, and split into two or more columns as the mold matures. Conidia form from these conidial heads. The conidia of A. giganteus are relatively thick-walled, and are distinguishable by their smooth, elliptical appearance as well as their size (3.5-4.5 x 2.4-3.0 Œºm). These traits are characteristic of both types of conidiophore. A. giganteus can be distinguished form other Aspergillus species placed within the Clavati section by its microscopic morphology and by its unique combination of extrolites, which are compounds synthesized by and then excreted by cells in defense against bacteria and other fungi. Morphologically, A. giganteus lacks the rhizoidal foot cells present in A. rhizopodus, and has clavate vesicles that stand in contrast to the elongated vesicles of A. longivesica. In terms of extrolite synthesis, although A. giganteus produces mycotoxins and antibiotics that are characteristic of all Clavati section species (such as patulin, tryptoquivalines and tryptoquivalones, and alpha-sarcins), it also produces extrolites not synthesized by its closest relatives. These include several different carotinoids and penicillin-like clavinformin.  Ecology  A. giganteus is found worldwide, and has been officially documented in Nigeria, the United States, Egypt, Mexico, Panama, Germany, Suriname, the Netherlands, and Poland. It is most often dung-borne, but will grow in alkaline soil and wood substrates. As a saprotrophic mold, A. giganteus gets its energy by absorbing nutrients from the substrates it grows in. Although many other Aspergillus and Clavati section species are known pathogens of humans, A. giganteus does not have any reported pathogenic effects. In the lab, A. giganteus has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid¬Æ (MEAOX) plates, as shown below. Aspergillus_giganteus_cya.pngAspergillus giganteus growing on CYA plate Aspergillus_giganteus_meaox.pngAspergillus giganteus growing on MEAOX plate  Economic relevance  = Antifungal protein (AFP) = A. giganteus produces an antifungal protein (AFP) that has potential applications for preventing fungal infection in both pharmaceutical and agricultural settings. AFP has been shown to restrict the growth of numerous economically-important filamentous fungi. These include Aspergillus fumigatus, the main cause of aspergillosis in humans, and other Aspergillus species; Fusarium oxysporum and related Fusarium species, common pathogens of tomato, bean, banana, melon, cotton, and chickpea plants; Magnaporthe grisea, a pathogen of rice and cereal crops; and Botrytis cineara, pathogenic to geranium and other economically important ornamental plants. Additionally, AFP may restrict the growth of the oomycete Phytopthera infestans, the pathogen infamous for causing late blight in potatoes (the main cause of the Irish potato famine) and tomatoes. In additional to having high potential for success in combatting the infections listed above, AFP does not inhibit the viability of yeast, bacteria, mammalian, or plant cells. Because there are many filamentous fungal species that do not respond to AFP, it is likely that the protein's detrimental effects are species-specific. As such, AFP could be used to treat and prevent infection by very specific pathogens without harm to patients or host plants. Furthermore, the protein can be easily synthesized through fermentation of A. giganteus and is resistant to hear. In comparison to other antifungal treatments, small amounts of the protein are needed to prevent the growth of harmful pathogens. In combination with the fact that AFP almost completely blocks growth of sensitive, pathogenic fungi (unlike the ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorine dioxide antifungal treatments currently used in agricultural systems,) these factors highlight AFP's potential as a cheap, mass-producible, and extremely effective solution to pathogen infection. = AFP mode of action = The cysteine-rich, amphipathic protein inhibits the growth of AFP-senstivie pathogens through multiple pathways. First, AFP may inhibit cell growth by inhibiting chitin synthesis. In sensitive fungi, AFP activates the cell wall integrity pathway, thereby enhancing the expression of the Œ±-1,3-glucan synthase A gene responsible for remodeling cell walls and inhibiting the formation of chitin. AFP may also alter the cell membrane permeability of sensitive fungi, particularly of Aspergillus niger, or cause an immediate, sustained increase in calcium cation cell resting potential that often results in programmed cell death. Each of these pathways ultimately results in the death of the AFP-sensitive pathogen. Although more research is needed to identify how these pathways work in consort, the wide variety of AFP modes of action highlights that the protein may interact with sensitive pathogens in different ways, that these pathogens vary in their susceptibility to AFP. = Preliminary studies on applications of AFP = In preliminary studies on the pharmaceutical and agricultural applications of AFP, researchers used AFP to halt the growth of Phytopthera infestans and Aspergillus species in culture. In applying AFP solutions to plant leaves and roots, infections by Botrytis cineara in geranium plants and Magnaporthe grisea in rice plants were eliminated. In each of these cases, AFP caused deformations in the hyphae of the sensitive fungi, resulting in reduced hyphal elongation and inability of the pathogen to grow. In addition to direct application to plant structures, the AFP-encoding gene can be edited into the genomes of the plants affected by the AFP-sensitive fungi such that the plants are able to synthesize the protein on their own. This technique has been successfully used to decrease infection by Puccinia substriata, the main cause of rust disease, and Sclerospora graminicola, a causal agent of downy mildew, in pearl millet plants, as well as infection by Magnaporthe grisea in rice plants. Although genetic enhancement halted infection in laboratory and greenhouse settings, researchers continue to debate about the scalability of plant genome editing and the ability of plants themselves to synthesize enough AFP to fight off pathogen infection in the field.

In addition, important foundations had to be laid, as the soil was sandy, on a bed of clay. There are three levels below the road. Built in concrete, with pink granite and crushed marble, the external walls are austere, but the interior contains mosaics in the design of a labyrinth and a courtyard and halls in a typical 1930s design. There is a pavilion, currently closed, located in square Saint-Lambert opposite, and a subway allowing students to enter and leave the establishment.C'√©tait hier... le XVe arrondissement - page 82 The main entrance through the rotunda was then exclusively for administrative and teaching staff. Movement between the first, second, and third floors took place by use of escalators, now removed for security reasons. The establishment offers literary classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles. A commemorative plaque comm√©morative in honour of the architect Fran√ßois Le Coeur was unveiled in 1994 by Prime Minister √âdouard Balladur.  Lyc√©e ranking  In 2016, the lyc√©e ranked 93rd out of 110 at d√©partemental level in terms of teaching quality and 1681st at the national level.Classement d√©partemental et national du lyc√©e The ranking is based on three criteria: the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur√©at having spent their last two years at the establishment, and added value (calculated based on the social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results).M√©thodologie du classement national des lyc√©es fran√ßais  Description  = The main building = The establishment is mostly based in a building facing square Saint-Lambert. It is very representative of the 1930s Art d√©co style due to its wide galleries, its paved courtyard, and its rotunda. It consists of six levels served by four staircases. * At -1 there are college rooms overlooking the courtyard. * On the ground floor is the main entrance, the office of the headmaster and deputy head, the secretaries of the college and lyc√©e, the music room, and the refectory. * On the first floor, there are classrooms for college and lyc√©e, IT rooms, the library, and the infirmary. *The second floor is mainly for college rooms but also has some for the lyc√©e. * The third floor is exclusively for lyc√©e, with the offices of the senior education consultant. * On the fourth floor are labs for life and Earth sciences, physics-chemistry and science options. * On the fifth floor are art rooms and life and Earth sciences. = Annex = Camille-S√©e also has a more recent annex, which contains the gymnasium for the lyc√©e and college. It includes areas for many sports. This includes, badminton, gymnastics, and bodybuilding (with weight training machines).  Alumni  Simone de Beauvoir taught in 1939, as did Maurice Clavel, in the 1960s and Janine M√©ary. The politician Marie-Caroline Le Pen was also a student.  British international section  Since 2010, the lyc√©e has offered a programme to prepare students for the bac option internationale (OIB) in the British section. There are currently classes until the final year in three streams, S, ES and L. The students in this stream obtained 100% pass rates in the bac in June 2017 and 35% obtained a merit.  Culture  The lyc√©e is at the centre of a scene in the film L.627. The last episode of the series Bref on Canal+, which takes place in square Saint- Lambert, ends with a shot of the school.Muriel Frat, ¬´ Bref: les deux derniers √©pisodes collectors ¬ª , Le Figaro.fr.

He was drugged before being beaten to death.  Background  In 1993, Gilles Andruet was using a martingale betting system that he had designed to win at blackjack. The system used Andruet's memory, his mathematical prowess, and the card-counting method devised by American player Ken Uston to its advantage. In his first year of using the martingale, Andruet won a lot of money and played increasingly often in casinos around the world, both out of enjoyment for the game and for the financial opportunities on offer. He drew attention to himself through his provocative personality and ended up on casinos‚Äô radars. He was ultimately banned from casino blackjack, being referred to as the ‚ÄúDemon of the Game‚Äù. Unable to play blackjack, he switched to roulette. However, his exceptional memory and mathematical abilities did not give him an advantage in roulette, and he lost much more than he won. His friends tried in vain to dissuade him from playing. In order to sustain his lifestyle, he started consuming and selling drugs, including heroin and cannabis. This led to the large amount of money won at blackjack rapidly evaporating, and he entered into the vicious cycle of gambling addiction. He spent more money than he had, took out loans that he could not repay, was banned from holding a bank account (known as interdit bancaire ‚Äì literally ‚Äúbank-barred‚Äù ‚Äì in France), became homeless, and his lifestyle became increasingly chaotic and vulnerable. On 4 August 1995, Andruet received a notary‚Äôs cheque of 398,000 francs as an advance on an aunt's inheritance. As he was banned from holding a bank account, he was unable to cash the cheque, so he asked his casino acquaintances for help. Joseph Liany ‚Äì a former businessman whom Andruet had met at the casino in Enghien-les-Bains, on the outskirts of Paris, and who was also a frequent gambler ‚Äì offered Andruet help through his son Franck. With Frank Liany as a guarantor and proxy, Andruet was able to open a bank account at Moroccan bank Chaabi (a subsidiary of the Banque Populaire du Maroc), where he cashed his cheque.  Murder  At around 11 p.m. on 21 August 1995, Gilles Andruet drove his car to a branch of the L‚ÄôEntrec√¥te restaurant chain in Paris to meet Yolanda, a friend who worked as a waitress there. Three men were in the car with him. Gilles Andruet's body was discovered by a market trader in the early hours of 22 August 1995, wrapped in a white mattress protector and half submerged in the river Yvette in Saulx-les-Chartreux, in the Essonne d√©partement south of Paris. Andruet had been drugged with morphine and Rohypnol ‚Äì known as a date-rape drug ‚Äì before repeatedly being hit with a baseball bat. His car was abandoned a few miles away from where his body was found. There were multiple bloodstains in the car boot, while a photocopy of the inheritance cheque was found in the glove compartment. In 2001, mitochondrial DNA was found on a hair on the mattress protector in which Andruet's body had been wrapped. The DNA was a match to an undetermined person in the Liany family. On 25 August 1995, Franck Liany emptied Andruet's bank account. = Suspects = Franck Liany was a waiter at Golf de l‚Äô√âtoile, a sports club and bar-restaurant near the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris. Sacha Rhoul, the manager of the club, was his cousin: Liany's father and Rhoul's mother are siblings. One night in December 1995, Lo√Øc Simon, a waiter at the sports club, openly complained of having received only 30,000 francs of the promised 50,000 from Joseph Liany for beating to death with a baseball bat a chess player who owed gambling debts to Liany. On 14 August 1996, shortly after confessing to murdering Gilles Andruet, Simon committed suicide by hanging. Yolanda, the waitress whom Andruet was meeting on the night of his death, gave a witness testimony confirming that Joseph Liany was one of the passengers in Andruet's car. Following her statement, Yolanda suffered persistent anonymous phone calls in which death threats were made to her and her child. These calls continued even after she changed her telephone number and made it unlisted.  Legal proceedings  = First trial (2003) = The first trial was held in November 2003. Sacha Rhoul was not called and did not attend. Rhoul's cousin, Franck Liany, was charged with receiving a murder weapon, while Rhoul's uncle, Joseph Liany, was charged with the murder of Gilles Andruet. Both defendants pleaded not guilty and blamed each other. 18 witnesses were called, many of whom are believed to have been threatened ‚Äì they displayed unusual memory lapses or submitted medical certificates excusing them from attending court. Regardless, Franck Liany was found guilty of receiving a murder weapon and sentenced to 7 years‚Äô imprisonment. Joseph Liany was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. The latter's conviction rested on witness statements and mitochondrial DNA extracted from the hair found on the mattress protector. Only Joseph Liany appealed his conviction. = Retrial of Joseph Liany (2006) = Joseph Liany appealed against his conviction and was granted a retrial in March 2006 at the Court of Assizes of the Val-de-Marne d√©partement. Sacha Rhoul was tried in absentia, found guilty and sentenced to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment. Despite this, it appeared that Rhoul was living freely in France at the time. Joseph Liany's defence relied solely on the fact that the mitochondrial DNA could also belong to Sacha Rhoul, Joseph's nephew. This was enough reasonable doubt to see Joseph Liany acquitted, to the despair of Jean-Claude Andruet, Gilles‚Äô father.

It was the first active human rights organization in Chile and it lasted for two years, supporting thousands of people persecuted by the regime. It dissolved under pressure from the regime in November 1975, but the Vicariate of Solidarity was formed in its wake shortly thereafter, and it took up the baton of protection of human rights in Chile.  Background  On a military junta toppled President Salvador Allende in a coup d'√©tat and installed General Augusto Pinochet as head of the new regime. This was a dictatorial, authoritarian regime which trampled on human rights with the use of torture, disappearances, illegal and secret arrest, and extrajudicial killings. Thousands were being detained, and hundreds killed by the regime. It was in this context, that the first opposition to the Pinochet regime appeared.  Founding  The first organized opposition to the regime came from the churches. The committee, more commonly known as \\"Committee for Peace\\" ('; also Comit√© Pro Paz en Chile') was founded by the Catholic, Methodist, Lutheran, Orthodox, and Pentecostal Churches, as well as the Jewish community in Chile. It was formalized by Archbishop Raul Silva Henriquez in Order 158-73 on , with the goal of \\"helping Chileans, who, as a result of recent political events, are in dire economic or personal straits,\\" and also to provide \\"legal, economic, technical, and spiritual\\" assistance. Its charter also called for ecumenical links to other religions to help carry out its work in favor of those who were persecuted by the regime. The Committee carried out its pro-human rights activity in the face of harassment and intimidation by the government, and was a risky proposition for those involved. A year later, a couple dozen members of the committee, mostly women who were looking for their \\"disappeared\\" relatives, went on to form a new group focused on pressuring the government for information about their \\"disappeared\\" relatives. This was formalized into a new group, the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared by Clotario Blest the next year.  Activities  The chief activity of the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile was the legal support for those persecuted by the government, as well as people arrested for political reasons without a trial. It also played a support role for those who lost their job for political reasons, and provided medical care. In the two years of its operation, it provided legal services to over 17,000 people, and medical care for an equal number.  Links with other groups  The Committee was the first such human rights group, but others followed, to the point where there were at least fifteen human rights groups operating in Chile by the mid-1980s. One that grew directly out of the Committee, was the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared. At the end of 1974, a group of mostly women applied to the Committee for Peace to find out the whereabouts of their missing family members, the desaparecidos (the disappeared), who had been detained or killed. The Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared coalesced unofficially out of this group of people. Clotario Blest formally established the group in 1975 out of her home in central Santiago.  Dissolution  When the Committee was dissolved at the demand of the government. At the same time as the government was arresting its lawyers, Pinochet wrote to Cardinal Raul Silva Henriquez on 11 November 1975 claiming that the Committee was being \\"used by Marxist- Leninists\\" to cause an appearance of division between the government and the Roman Catholic Church, and used this as an excuse to demand its dissolution.  Follow-up  The Archbishop established its successor organization, the Vicariate of Solidarity in January 1976, which took over the responsibility of defending human rights in Chile and was less subject to pressure than the Committee for Peace had been, because it was under the full protection of the Roman Catholic Church.

The work was published in 1991 and dedicated to Andrew Fairbairns. A subset of the music for children's choir was published as Bless the Lord.  History  Benedicite was commissioned for the 1989 Singing Day in Edinburgh by the British Federation of Young Choirs. Carter, an English composer and church musician in York, was inspired by the restoration of roof bosses at the southern transept of York Minster, which had been destroyed in a fire in 1984. They depict around 60 images of creatures. The music is written to convey a child-like perspective of the wonders of Creation. Benedicite was published in 1991 and dedicated to Andrew Fairbairns. A subset of the music for children's choir was published as Bless the Lord.  Structure and music  Carter set the hymn Benedicite from the Book of Common Prayer in six movements, and interspersed three additional movements, whose texts are free variations on the model, to be sung by a unison children's choir. The movements are titled: # O all ye works of the Lord # Green Things # Sun and Moon # Badgers and Hedgehogs # Ice and Snow # Whales and Waters # Butterflies and Moths # Thunder and Lightning # Spirits and Souls # Grannies and Grandads # O let the earth bless the Lord The duration is given as 35 minutes. The first movement, beginning \\"O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord\\", is marked Molto ritmico (Most rhythmic) and is in 2+2+2+3/8 time. The three movements based on added text to be sung by a children's choir were also published separately as Bless the Lord, which is concluded with the final movement. The movements are: * Badgers and Hedgehogs (Benedicite No. 4) * Butterflies and Moths (Benedicite No. 7) * Grannies and Grandads (Benedicite No. 10) * O Let The Earth Bless The Lord  Performances and recordings  The first performance of Benedicite was at the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh on 5 November 1989, conducted by Philip Ledger. The work was recorded, together with Rutter's Requiem, by the Wayne Oratorio Society at Wayne Presbyterian Church on 10 May 2006, conducted by Jeffrey B. Fowler.

It is the principle that a person's primary or prioritised identity is that of membership in a social network. Groupists assume that individuals in a group tend to have stronger affinity and obligation to a particular group when the influence of an authority figure brings a common goal. The concept of groupism can be defined and criticized in varied ways for disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, political history and philosophy. Group-ism is defined in most dictionaries as the behavior of a member of a group where they think and act as the group norm at the expense of individualism. The term originated around mid 19th century and the first known use of the word recorded was in 1851. It is a general definition often used in Indian English as the tendency to form factions in a system setting. The term had also been used for ‚Äúthe principles or practices of Oxford Group movement‚Äù which is now historical and rare.  Perspectives: criticism  = Rogers Brubaker: Social groupism = \\"The tendency to take discrete, sharply differentiated, internally homogeneous and externally bounded groups as basic constituents of social life, chief protagonists of social conflicts, and fundamental units of social analysis\\" Groupism has been a deeply entrenched and fundamental aspect of social analysis of nationalism, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexuality, age, class or even groups with combination of these categories but with a common interest in other universal categories like sports, music and values. It is commonly seen on everyday context in media reports and even academic research leading to policy analysis. According to Brubaker, it is the view that division among humans such as ethnicity is an absolute, unchanging entity rather than a changing conceptual variable subject to time and context. It is the tendency to take discrete groups as chief protagonists of social conflicts, to reify such groups as if they were unitary collective actors. It is considered a \\"process in which individuals are reduced to specific group characteristic which are politicised as boundaries\\". Conceptual groupism involves essentialising groups without taking into account that such habit of giving groups performative character taken into account in ethnopolitical conflict analysis could lead to intentional/unintentional framing of conflict between groups. In the example of ethnic groups, it involves viewing an individual in the group as the collective representative of the values or conflicts associated with the social norm of that group. American sociologist Rogers Brubaker has criticised conceptual groupism for its stereotypical approach in social and political analysis which leads to decisions that trivialize individual need to protect the labelled collective interest of a political group or institution. Brubaker suggests that instead of taking \\"groups\\" as substantial entities, social and political analysis of the \\"groupness\\" should be brought about in terms of political, social, cultural and psychological processes listed below * Distinguishing practical categories and groups * Group making as a sociopolitical and cultural project * From categories to cognitive schema *Discursive frames * Organizational routines * Institutional forms * Political projects * Contingent events According to Norwegian anthropologist Fredric Barth, ethnicity, race and nationality categories are a matter of factors such as self identification/external categorisation, at individual/institutional level or formal/ informal context. Research on how ethnic, racial and national groups are classified and categorised began through studies on the colonial and post colonial societies. Brubaker suggests that there should be a focus on categories so that ethnicity, race and nationhood can co exist without ethnic 'groups' as separate entities as transforming groups into categories reduces the extent to which misleading political and legal analysis based on groupism turns to a framed reality. = Susanne Baer: Legal groupism = Legal groupism is the construction of groups in legal matter as defined by the German legal scholar Susanne Baer. Legal groupism also posits that equal right should be given to groups hence assuming that people always belong to a \\"distinguishable\\" group rather than many. This concept is regarded as problematic because most groups have unclear and shifting boundaries due to individuals living multiple identities and group characteristics. Therefore, Legal groupism come into conflict with the idea of individual rights when human rights issues are constructed as group issues in law and complete autonomy given to major religious institution in the name of religious freedom then curtail individual human right issues. For example, when constitutional law allows churches and religious communities to self determine matters conflicting with human rights without considering the rights of diverse individuals within a seemingly homogeneous group, such overlapping between human rights and religion has led to lack of legal intervention in matters like sexual discrimination. For example, religious authority power to internally handle child abuse cases, the European Union's exemption of religious organisation from fundamental rights in the EU proposal for a new Directive against discrimination 2008.  Case studies  = Legal status of indigenous people: Sami focus = It has been estimated that there are over 300 million indigenous people around the world some among which includes the Red Indians, Sami in Northern Europe, the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders of Australia and the Maori of New Zealand, Ainu people of Japan, Bantu in Somalia, Assyrians of the Middle east, the Kazakhs, Mongols, Tajik, Tibetans, Ugyur, and Eurasian Nomads of Kazakhstan, eastern Russia. In order to acquire group rights indigenous people also happen to be under the regulation of national and international law. Although International customary law at the United nation and elsewhere has regarded indigenous people as a category since the 20th century, the definition of indigenous people has been a subject of ongoing debate at the national level since their classification as a group by the national law has interfered with their traditional group making processes. For example, The Finland government ratified ILO convention no.169 in 1989 which involved declaration of right for indigenous people of Finland such as the following definition of legal requirement to vote to the election of the Sami parliament. \\"For the purpose of this Act, a Sami means a person who considers himself a Sami, provided: 1\\\\. That he himself or at least one of his parents or grandparents has learnt Sami as his first language; 2\\\\. That he is a descendant of a person who has been entered in a land, taxation or population register as a mountain, forest or fishing Lapp; or 3\\\\. That at least one of his parents has or could have been registered as an elector for an election to the Sami Delegation or the Sami Parliament.\\" This definition has led to the S√°mi debate in Finland a problem of defining the legal status of S√°mi indigenous people as the groupist system of political and legal analysis has framed indigeinity as a political requirement rather than an ethnocultural reality hence the inconsistency between the definition that Sami people has held for their kinship. = Groupism in Japan = Groupism is viewed as deeply rooted part of the Japanese group oriented society known for their high productivity, cooperative attitude and surpassing international competitive strength. Some of the key aspects of groupism in Japanese society has been discussed in the journal article, 'The Paradox of Japan's Groupism: Threat to Future Competitiveness' by Kanji Haitani. # Identity and well being: unmei kyodotai meaning \\"communities of shared destiny\\" is a core principle in Japanese culture where an individual's well being and sense of security is maximised as a result of recognition and prosperity they get as a group. # Seniority: There is close correlation between a member's age and their rank in a system. # Emphasis on the relationships of harmony and conflict (wa): The wa concept encompasses the concept of 'Isshin ‚Äì dotai' meaning 'one mind ‚Äì same body'. Here 'one mind' refers to how senior members take into account the views of junior members who reciprocally internalizes the wisdom of the senior members. # The insider-outsider mentality: Insider and Outsider groups are generally separated with clear distinction. # Rank and status consciousness # The closed nature of Japanese market in context of international economy  Social hierarchy in traditional music making process  The ry≈´ha-iemoto system refers to social organisation in Japanese traditional music making which is shown to be dominated by the hierarchical form of groupism. This involves an authoritative group called \\"Miyagi- ha\\" at the top of hierarchy who gets the greatest benefits of musical freedom, recognition, power and money. This group is known for transmission of their composition to subgroups down in the hierarchy. One of the characteristics of this form of social organisation involves lifetime affiliation as a subgroup member whereby there is no \\"graduation\\" or \\"becoming a free musician\\".  Effects: conceptual links  = Nationalism = A form of groupism which generally began as a sense of security provided by national identity to an unquestioning acceptance of a political agenda. It is based on an abstract mentality of ‚Äúvictory‚Äù in one's own group and considering the ‚Äúother‚Äù as a separate entity. The irrational obedience of German citizens during the Nazi regime of the 1930s and 1940s holocaust is a well known example of the negative consequences rooted in groupism. In terms of Legal studies, international lawyer Philip Allot has criticized the concept of state sovereignty in the current international laws in promoting groupism and the lack of reform in the 21st century context. = Prejudice and discrimination = Prejudice against certain groups of people is rooted in groupism whereby conclusions or attitude about a group of people is drawn without evaluating the evidence and often leads to discrimination which refers to the behaviour of treating other groups in a different way than one's own group.[9] * In-group bias: The tendency to favor members of one's own group than a person outside the group such as in sports or celebrity fan behavior. * Out group homogeneity: The tendency to view all members from other groups as highly similar rather than viewing them as individuals. = Persuasion = Persuasion through individuals, sub-groups or the group as a whole leads to behavioural change without rational choice. It also involves the power of normative influence from one's heritage, culture and tradition to which people comply with its social norms to gain recognition or to avoid other's disapproval. These concepts are broadly summarised in terms of groupism and can have both positive and negative connotation based on varying scale of groupism in a formal or informal system. Extreme forms of groupism well known in the past and present includes racism, bigotry, terrorism, genocide, dictatorship and war. = Social psychology = Social Psychology brings the concept of how individual psyche is shaped by the sociological constructs. In summary, social constructs formed by prejudice, discrimination, racism and nationalism can be ascribed to groupism which an individual can obtain throughout life based on their socio-cultural and historical context that leads to psychological development as a child. Social loafing is the phenomenon when the presence of other members in a group causes some to avoid responsibilities and exert less effort towards a group goal. Social disruption whereby the presence of others negatively influences the performance of tasks. Social facilitation which is a phenomenon proposed by Robert Zajonc is another example of the positive aspects of groupism where the presence and influence of diverse groups enhances the performance of a task. This is the opposite of social disruption whereby the presence of others negatively influences the performance of tasks that are relatively difficult. = Group selection = Scientific evidence from early hominids in Africa that shows humans have evolved as small social groups that are predisposed to include or exclude others in an instinctual manner. Evolution of humans as a unitary social species has led to the social status and sense of belonging that comes with identifying oneself or being identified as an individual in different categories of group. Research by anthropologist Robin Dunbar suggested that the ratio of the size of the neocortex to the brain size determines the amount of social relationship in different species and found that humans have relatively high social brain that can have tendency to form greater interpersonal networks of small groups than animals such as chimpanzees and dolphins with smaller neocortex size to brain size ratio hence smaller number of relationships. Groupism has been explained in terms of a biological need to form social bonds according to the need to belong theory whereby deprivation of this need has been shown to have Bio-psycho-social consequences. From the perspective of evolution, social influences on the individual based on natural selection has led to better adaptation and survival in various environments.

Paramilitary forces opened fire on striking workers, resulting in 200 killed and many injured.  Background  In 1977, the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime was overthrown by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, which unleashed new attacks on the working class and trade unions. The military dictatorship crushed left-wing activists and trade unionists and oppressed different layers of society. Violent events from mass killings of workers to genocide of peasants and youth engulfed the country. Zia implemented policies friendly to industrialists, which saw forceful imprisonment of workers, a ban on trade unions, low wages and contract labour. Nationalized industries were given back to industrialists with hefty compensation and capitalists took revenge on workers in the form of brutal repression. Colony Textile Mills was established as a textile manufacturing unit in 1946 under Colony Group. Colony Group was founded by Mohammad Ismaeel and was divided into three divisions headed by Farooq A Shaikh, Naseer A Shaikh and Mughis A Shaikh. Colony Textile Mills was headed by the latter. It was initially established at Faisalabad but, due to competition with Delhi Cloth & General Mills of Sir Shri Ram, it shifted to Multan in the 1940s. During the 1970s, the owners of Colony Group were in the top seven industrialist families among 22 industrialist families who owned 66% of the total industrial assets, 70% of insurance and 80% of banking. This group also owned shares in newspapers and became active in politics as well. One of the division leaders, Naseer A Shaikh, was on the board of the Civil and Military Gazette and Nawa-i-Waqt while another, Farooq A Shaikh, contested elections for the national assembly in 1970. The third, Mughis A Shaikh, had a good relationship with Zia-ul-Haq, since he was a Corps Commander in Multan.  Events  = Strike = In 1978, Colony Textile Mills was one of the most profitable factories in Pakistan, and it employed more than 5000 workers. When workers learned that the factory had made profits, they argued that they were owed a bonus under the Labour Policy of 1972, which extended the scope of the labour laws and entitled workers to increased profit-sharing and a statutory bonus. However, the owner refused to pay the bonus. The Workers' Union furnished a strike notice to management. On the morning of 29 December 1977, workers went on complete shutdown of the factory through their peaceful strike. According to a January 3 1978 newspaper report: \\"Workers were demanding a three months' bonus along with one month's recreational allowance.\\" The mill administration agreed to pay a two months' bonus at the end of January, but workers rejected the offer and stopped working on 29 December 1977. = Massacre = On 2 January 1978, the daughter of mill owner Shaikh was getting married. The dowry of the bride was ten times higher than the bonus owed to the workers. Zia-ul-Haq was invited to attend. A rumor spread that strikers were going to attack the wedding ceremony. Zia-ul-Haq ordered the state paramilitary force to shoot workers and crush their movement. A participant of this struggle, Lal Khan, recounted the incident in his book: > The paramilitaries started firing directly at the workers who were gathering > for a peaceful gate meeting. In a scene of indescribable horror workers > screamed and stampeded over the bloodstained corpses of their workmates, > crushing many others as they desperately tried to evade the carnage. Blood > was everywhere, streaming from the bodies of the workers whose only crime > was to ask for their basic rights. The firing continued uninterrupted for > three hours. By six-o'clock in the evening, when darkness had set in, the > state forces had 'conquered' the textile mill workers. In the factory > compound and lawns the state forces had prevented the bodies of the injured > from being taken to hospital. Those who tried to pick them up were hampered > by the police. Dozens had died on the spot. Several injured had died due to > excessive loss of blood because they were prevented from being rushed for > medical treatment. In the darkness of the night the state forces, without > differentiating between the dead and the injured, brought up trucks and > threw the bodies into them. Some were thrown in the huge factory gutter, > while others were buried without coffins in the nearby village of Bagasher. > In spite of the terror of this ruthless state, hundreds of workers and > students (including the author) kept on taking the injured to the hospitals > and tried to save the lives of as many workers as possible. Later on an > effort was made to remove the bodies of the workers from the gutter and > place them elsewhere, in order to arrange for their proper burial with their > comrades and relatives present. While official and press reports stated that some 13 to 22 people were killed, unofficial estimates put the total number as high as 150‚Äì200. Similarly, the Workers Action Committee estimated 133 killed and more than 400 injured.  Aftermath  After this massacre, the Workers Action Committee emerged and led mass protests against this incident. This sparked a nationwide protest and a No work day was observed by trade unions across Pakistan on 9 and 10 January 1978. Prominent politicians like Nusrat Bhutto, Wali Khan, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan and others strongly condemned the military regime. On 4 January 1978, the Martial Law administrator of Multan ordered an inquiry. S.H.O Raja Khizer Hayat and police constable Hakim Ali were arrested and tried in a military court. Compensation of Rs 10,000 was provided to the killed workers' heirs by the owner of the mill. Prominent leaders of the Workers Action Committee also were arrested and prosecuted.

He has been chief executive officer of Bovis Homes since April 2017. Fitzgerald held the same position at Galliford Try from 2005 to 2015.  Early life and career  Fitzgerald was born in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales to Welsh parents. His father was a warrant officer in the Royal Navy and the family followed him on postings to Singapore, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Dartmouth. From the age of four he lived in Devon and attended school in Torquay. He left school at 16 with three O levels and went to work as a dish washer in a hotel in Dartmouth. Whilst there he heard, from the head chef, of a job opening as an apprentice estimator on the Youth Training Scheme at Midas Construction. He did not qualify for the position but was taken on as a tea boy, turning down a position as a radio operator with the Royal Navy to do so; having had experience of unskilled work he worked \\"like a maniac\\" to pass his exams and gain qualifications. Fitzgerald attended a building studies course at South Devon College between 1982 and 1986. In 1992, at the age of 28, the head of Midas Construction, Len Lewis, asked Fitzgerald to set up a housebuilding division at the firm and take a 15% stake in it. Fitzgerald was initially reluctant, considering housebuilding as a job for \\"pansies\\" and concerned about the business' prospects in the early 1990s recession. However the business did well and in 1997 was sold to Galliford for ¬£5 million; Fitzgerald subsequently co-founded Gerald Wood Homes and within two years also sold it to Galliford (which became Galliford Try in 2000).  Galliford Try  Shortly after the sale of Gerald Wood Homes Fitzgerald was brought into Galliford Try to head its housebuilding division. He became the company's chief executive officer (CEO) in 2005. His initial actions were to increase revenues in its construction division before focusing on housebuilding. He led the company's ¬£244 million acquisition of Linden Homes in 2007, at the height of the housing boom. Following the Great Recession he implemented a ¬£125 million rights issue to take advantage of the fall in land prices, a move described as \\"audacious\\" by industry watchers. He also instigated the purchase of Miller Construction in 2014, increasing the company's annual construction turnover to ¬£1.25 billion. Fitzgerald resigned as CEO at the end of 2015, remaining with the company first as executive chairman and then as a non-executive director until his retirement in November 2016. Because of the acquisition history Fitzgerald has been reported as having spent 33 years at Galliford and having risen from tea boy to chief executive at the same company.  Bovis Homes  Four months into his retirement Fitzgerald was offered the position of CEO of Bovis Homes. The company was in financial trouble owing to poor customer relations ‚Äì having moved people into new houses which were not finished or had defects. His appointment headed off acquisition bids by fellow top-10 UK housebuilders Galliford Try and Redrow. Fitzgerald immediately invested ¬£3 million of his own money into the company and embarked on a tour of its sites to raise morale and determine the problems the company faced. His main objective was to raise levels of customer satisfaction. He also implemented reform of the company's training and apprenticeship programs. Within eight months his actions had raised the share price by 30%.  Personal life and personality  Fitzgerald is regarded as a straight talking \\"likeable, sweary leader\\". He has also been described as \\"ballsy\\" and popular amongst investment analysts. Fitzgerald is an advocate of reform of the Help to Buy scheme in the form of a levy to bring in revenue for the government from housebuilders and for high earners, including himself, to pay more tax. Fitzgerald is a supporter of the Wales national rugby union team and Manchester United F.C. His two stepdaughters both work in the same industry: Michelle as an affordable housing manager at Baker Estates and Nadine at Galliford Try Linden Homes on its help to buy scheme.

On the evening of December 5, 1998, Engebretson vanished while searching for a Christmas tree with his father and grandfather, who realized they had lost sight of him in the late afternoon. Footprints and a snow angel near the road were found, but by the time law enforcement arrived that evening, a blizzard prevented immediate searches. Over the ensuing weeks, law enforcement and volunteer searchers continued to traverse the area, but no sign of Engebretson was found. Subsequent reports of a mysterious vehicle in the area that day were made. In October 1999, graffiti was discovered in a rural rest area bathroom south of Portland, which purportedly referred to Engebretson; the content of the graffiti was never made public. In 2008, it was revealed that Frank James Milligan, a convicted child rapist, was considered a potential suspect in Engebretson's disappearance. , Engebretson's whereabouts remain unknown. Timeline =Disappearance= On December 5, 1998, eight-year-old Derrick Engebretson traveled to Pelican Butte with his father and grandfather near Rocky Point, Oregon, roughly from Klamath Falls and immediately south of Crater Lake National Park. The three had planned to look for a Christmas tree. At some point during the excursion, Engebretson wandered away from his father and grandfather. He was reported missing that evening by his father and grandfather, who notified a passing motorist around 4:13 p.m.; the motorist traveled to a nearby resort approximately away, where he placed a phone call to 9-1-1. =Investigation= Law enforcement discovered a \\"crude shelter\\" made of fir boughs beneath several fallen logs near the area Engebretson went missing, but search dogs were unable to detect his scent there. Due to the extreme conditions of the area, law enforcement speculated he would have quickly succumbed to the elements. Engebretson's parents stated that their son had \\"grown up in the mountains\\" and was used to walking distances of in steep terrain. In the hours immediately after Engebretson's disappearance, his family and law enforcement discovered small footprints in the snow, which made a loop from the location where his father had last seen him to a clearing near the road, where a snow angel presumably left by Engebretson was found. A snowplow had obliterated the tracks that led away from the snow angel, and no additional footprints were found. Several pieces of chopped wood were also discovered nearby; when he disappeared, Engebretson had a small hatchet with him and was dressed in a snowsuit. In the late evening, a blizzard hit the area, hampering search efforts. Initial searches were completed by foot with search canines, as well as aerial searches using a Civil Air Patrol plane and an Air Force Reserve helicopter. Several relatives also undertook independent searches. On December 13, 1998, eight days into the investigation, Klamath County Police suspended their search. Engebretson's family continued independent search efforts and camped at the site in a donated camper van over the following two weeks, while hundreds of volunteers continued to organize search efforts. On December 18, further search efforts were terminated due to subzero temperatures, which made it unsafe for anyone to travel through the area. In the ensuing months more than 10,000 hours were spent performing ground searches. Early in the investigation, a witness claimed to have seen an unidentified man struggling with a young boy in the area later during the day Engebretson disappeared. The witness ignored the event as they had assumed the man was the boy's father. Additional reports were made of an unidentified man driving a two-door Honda asking passersby for directions in the forest that day. =Subsequent events= On September 24, 1999, graffiti was discovered in a bathroom at the Sagehen Rest Area, approximately south of Portland, that law enforcement identified as being referential to Engebretson's disappearance. Engebretson's parents drove to view the graffiti upon being notified, and his mother, Lori, stated to the press: \\"I think it's just a big, sick joke. I thought, if somebody would have had Derrick, if they put this on the wall, they were wanting to be caught. If they were wanting to be caught, why didn't they leave something of Derrick's there?\\" The contents of the graffiti were not made public. In 2008, it was confirmed that Frank James Milligan, a man serving a sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in Dallas, Oregon, was considered a potential suspect in Engebretson's disappearance.

Following the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Marengo, they agreed to evacuate Italy as far as the Mincio and abandon strongholds in Piedmont and Milan. Great Britain and Austria were allies and hoped to negotiate a peace treaty with France, but Napoleon insisted on separate treaties with each nation. The negotiations failed, and fighting resumed on 22 November 1800.  Background  left The War of the Second Coalition was the second war against revolutionary France by various European monarchies. The Second Coalition was led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and included the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, Naples, various German monarchies and several other minor European states. Its aim was to contain the expansion of the French Republic and to restore the monarchy in France.\\"Second Coalition.\\" World History: The Modern Era, ABC-CLIO, 2018. French troops returned to Italy in 1799, following a brief period of absence which had precipitated the collapse of their Italian client republics. Napoleon Bonaparte, who had seized power in the Coup of 18 Brumaire, carried out a crossing of the Alps with his Army of the Reserve (officially commanded by Louis-Alexandre Berthier) in May 1800. This move, made almost before the passes were open, threatened Austrian General Michael von Melas' lines of communications in northern Italy. The French army then seized Milan on 2 June, followed by Pavia, Piacenza and Stradella, cutting the main Austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the Po river. Bonaparte hoped that Melas' preoccupation with the Siege of Genoa, held by French General Andr√© Mass√©na, would prevent the Austrians from responding to his offensive. However, Mass√©na surrendered the town on 4 June, freeing a large number of Austrians for operations against the French. On 9 June French General Jean Lannes beat Austrian Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. Bonaparte subsequently convinced himself that Melas would not attack and, further, that the Austrians were about to retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near Nice and Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road. The Battle of Marengo was fought on 14 June 1800 between Bonaparte and Melas near Alessandria. Towards the end of the day, the French overcame the Austrian surprise attack.  Convention  Land ceded by the Convention of Alessandria At 4:00am on 15 June 1800, von Melas sent General Johann Ferdinand von Skal and two captains to the French encampment with a flag of surrender. Napoleon, who had expected the Austrians to continue fighting, quickly accepted the surrender. A cease-fire was signed a few hours later. In the agreement, the Austrians agreed to evacuate to the left bank of the Bormida, and that hostilities would cease for forty-eight hours. The Austrians initially hoped to give up only Piedmont and Genoa, but Napoleon demanded they retreat to behind the Po and Mincio. The final agreement was formalized and signed as the Convention of Alessandria. On 15 June, the Convention was signed. It caused the fighting to end, and the Austrians agreed to evacuate Italy as far as the Mincio and abandon all of their strongholds in the Piedmont and Milan, losing all that they had gained in 1798 and 1799. The Austrians agreed to give the French Tortona, Alessandria, Milan, Turin, Pizzighetone, Arona, and Piacenza by 20 June. They agreed to surrender by 24 June the fortress of Coni, the castles of Seva and Savona, and the city of Genoa; and the city of Urbino by 26 June. The land between the Chiesa, the Oglio, and the Po rivers was ceded to the French, and that between the Chiesa and the Mincio was designated a neutral zone, not to \\"be occupied by either of the two armies.\\" The Austrians retained control of Tuscany, and the bulk of their army, with the French letting their soldiers retreat.  Aftermath  Allegory Representing the Convention of Alessandria after Napoleon's Victory at the Battle of Marengo by alt=On 17 June, Napoleon left for Paris after the signing of the Convention. He stopped in Milan that same day, and was greeted as a hero, with large crowds celebrating his arrival. The Cisalpine Republic was again established as a French client republic, and a temporary government was put in place until the signing of a peace treaty with Austria. Many strongholds listed in the convention were given up by the Austrians and their fortifications dismantled by the French, including Genoa on 24 June. Napoleon left Milan the same day, and stopped briefly in Turin and Lyon before arriving in Paris on 2 July. The victory consolidated Napoleon's political position in Paris as First Consul. French historian Fran√ßois Furet noted that the battle served as \\"the true coronation of [Napoleon's] power and his regime\\". General Officer Count Joseph Saint-Julien was sent to deliver the convention to Francis II, and it was soon ratified by the Court of Vienna. It proved to be only a temporary cease-fire, as Johann Amadeus von Thugut (and the Austrian government) refused to accept the terms and give up any of Austria's Italian holdings. Francis II, several hours before receiving the Convention on 20 June 1800, had signed a treaty with Britain, in which Britain agreed to give Austria two million pounds sterling in exchange for Austria continuing the war with France. The treaty also prohibited negotiations between Austria and France without the involvement of Britain before 1 February 1801. Austria soon dispatched Saint-Julien to travel to Paris, carrying news of the treaty's ratification, and to further consider the terms of it. He arrived on 21 July and began negotiations. On 22 July he attended a meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at which Saint-Julien was persuaded to assume the position of an accredited diplomat and sign several preliminary articles on 28 July. Saint-Julien and G√©raud Duroc were dispatched to deliver the news to Vienna. On 4 August, they arrived at Alt Oettiugen, the headquarters of Paul Kray. The negotiations were disavowed by Austria due to their treaty with Britain. Duroc was turned away and Saint-Julien was arrested for negotiating without instructions. On 29 September, the Convention of Castiglione was signed, extending the Convention of Alessandria; but further negotiations at Lun√©ville were fruitless, as Napoleon demanded separate peace treaties with England and Austria. On 22 November 1800 hostilities resumed.  Historical opinion  British general and military historian John Mitchell later argued in 1846 that the French would have accepted many fewer concessions and wrote that \\"nothing equal to this ill-fated convention had ever been known in military history.\\" The treaty was described by British historian Thomas Henry Dyer in 1877 as \\"one of the most disgraceful capitulations in history.\\" Historian David Bell concluded in 2014 that a bulk of the Austrian army had survived the Battle of Marengo, and Melas was still in a position that he could have continued fighting. Prussian historian Dietrich Heinrich von B√ºlow \\"the keenest contemporary observer of the 1800 campaign,\\" said of the convention: \\"Bonaparte did not seize success; Melas threw it away.\\" According to historian David Hollins, the victory allowed Napoleon to \\"secure his political power for the next 14 years.\\"  Notes   References   Bibliography           Category:Treaties of France Category:1800 treaties Category:War of the Second Coalition Category:Treaties of Austria Category:Napoleonic Wars treaties ","title":"Convention of Alessandria"},{"id":"58541085","text":"Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I subunit beta is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PGGT1B gene.

Married to the artist Jos√© Antonio Fern√°ndez- Muro, she lived in Buenos Aires, Paris, New York and Madrid. She is considered as one of the most important Latin American artists of the 20th century.  Career  Sarah Grilo began her career as a self-taught artist. In 1944, she began studying at the studio of the Catalan artist Vicente Puig. There, she met her husband, the artist Jos√© Antonio Fern√°ndez-Muro. In 1949, she presented her first solo exhibition in Madrid, which was characterised by being a mixture of figuration and cubism. Around this period, her paintings became more abstract. In 1952, she joined the group Artistas Modernos de la Argentina, under the direction of Aldo Pellegrini. The group, made up of artists such as Enio Iommi, Alfredo Hlito, Tom√†s Maldonado, Lidy Prati and Jos√© Antonio Fern√°ndez-Muro, among others, was presented in exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro until it was dissolved in 1954. Following the dissolution of the group, Sarah Grilo moved to Paris. During this period, between 1957 and 1961, her work became more lyrical. In 1962, she won the Guggenheim Fellowship. The prize marked a turning point in her career and she moved to New York. From then on, she gradually freed herself from Geometric abstraction and developed a new plastic language. Her gestural works combined coloured surfaces, drips, digital and textual signs, graffiti. In 1970, the artist left for the south of Spain, where she would stay until 1979 with her family.

Synopsis Tabaluga (the last dragon on Earth), is growing up in lush Greenland. While searching for his dragon fire, he meets a beautiful ice princess, Lilli, from frozen Iceland. The inhabitants of the two lands are highly suspicious of each other, but Tabaluga and Lilli are surprised to find out that the prejudices are wrong, and they like each other. Lilli takes Tabaluga to see Arktos, the ruler of Iceland, not knowing that Arktos has frozen all the dragons and killed Tabaluga's parents. Arktos tries to kill Tabaluga with his magical ice weapons, but Lilli and her polar bear friend Limbo help him to escape and go with him to Greenland. Tabaluga and Lilli begin a romance. Arktos sends an army to invade Greenland. Tabaluga's old raven guardian, Kolk, advises him to visit the wise Nessaja in the swamps, who tells him that his fire was always in his heart, though the dragon does not believe her at first. Lilli returns to Iceland to try to inspire a popular uprising against Arktos, but he captures her and then traps Tabaluga, who follows her. When Arktos moves to kill Lily, Tabaluga finds his fire and fights against Arktos's ice weapons. Lilli steals Arktos's hat, which blinds Arktos, and Tabaluga is able to melt Arktos to a tiny size; Arktos flees. The Icelanders and Greenlanders become friends.

It was built in the 1650 by Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reign, 1628-1658) near his hunting lodge in Hasthal. The three storeyed tower is 16.87 meters (55 feet) tall and stands on a raised octagonal platform. The minar is built with bricks and clad with red sandstone. The tower structure and design resembles the Qutub Minar of Delhi and was inspired by it. Originally, the Mini Qutub Minar was a 5 storeyed tower, topped out with a domed Chhatri pavilion at the top. It was used by emperor Shah Jahan for his entertainment after hunting in the all encompassing wilderness that used to surround this colossal Hastsal minaret and royal hunting lodge. The emperor's Shikargah or hunting lodge is situated a few hundred metres from the minaret tower. The Mini Qutub Minar is a 'Grade A' listed, protected heritage monument with the Department of Archaeology, India. History In the past, the Hastsal area where the Minar is located, used to be submerged in water and it used to be elephant's corridor and resting place. The origin of the area name ‚ÄòHastsal' indicates this with haathi (elephant) and sthal (place). In the early 17th century, Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan used Hastsal as one of his hunting lodges. In 1650, he commissioned the construction of a tall minaret similar to Qutub Minar in Delhi. When completed, the Mini Qutub Minar was much higher than it is now. It was a tall 5 storey tower with an internal stairway leading to the domed Chhatri pavilion at the top. It was a gorgeous hunting pavilion tower in the center of an encompassing wilderness. The emperor rested in the tower top, royally-entertained with his immediate retinue after hunting in the surrounding wilderness. Local legends claim there used to be a tunnel from the tower to the royal hunting lodge which lie a few hundred meters apart from each other. The domed Chhatri pavilion and upper two storeys of the tower had collapsed in the 18th century. In recent history, Shah Jahan's Mini Minar and his royal hunting lodge has laid abandoned and forgotten. It was left to crumble away and become completely surrounded by the urbanization that replaced the wilderness of Hastsal area. In the past, local kids were able to climb the tower using the internal stairway and play at the top but it is no longer allowed. Architecture The Mini Qutub Minar structure is similar to Qutub Minar in Delhi. It originally consisted of five storeys, each with a reducing diameter. A narrow staircase built inside led to the top. Each storey is surrounded by an octagonal ring in the outside with red sandstone overhanging eves (Chhajja) like in the Qutub Minar. The minar is built using Lakhori bricks. However, 20th-century historian Zafar Hasan who documented the tower disagrees with the tower once been five storeys high. He wrote, ‚ÄúLocally it is said that it originally consisted of five storeys and was crowned by a domed chhatri but the two topmost storeys subsequently disappeared...the statement that it was originally five-storeys high does not seem to be true, possibly it was topped by a chhatri which is not now existing‚Äù. Threats The Mini Qutub Minar is engendered today due to decades of neglect and lack of conservation. It is in danger from both natural elements and the encroachment of new constructions that are taking place around the tower in Hastsal. The tower is today completely surrounded by haphazardly built houses, buildings and new constructions. New constructions have sprung up right up to the tower base. The raised octagonal platform of Mini Qutub Minar used to have a lower platform. New constructions have encroached into the lower platform. The steps that lead up to the octagonal platform have disappeared. The only access way to the tower is by walking through a grimy half-meter wide lane that is surrounded in all sides by new constructions. Few hundred meters away the Shajahan's historic royal hunting lodge (Shikargah) is facing the same situation. It also lay abandon, crumbling and completely encroached upon with new constructions.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Genesee County was carved out in 1835, and the land for the courthouse square was immediately identified. The owners at the time donated it to the county at the end of the year, and the county government was formally recognized by the territory of Michigan in 1836. The county courts first met in various stores, and the first courthouse at the current site, a log structure, was constructed in 1838‚Äì1839. The log building was deemed unsafe to hold county records, and in 1851 a brick office building was added. The log courthouse burned in 1866, and by 1867 the county constructed a new courthouse, jail, and sheriff's office. By the early 1900s, these buildings were too small for the county, and in 1904‚Äì1905, a new a new Renaissance Revival-style courthouse and jail were constructed. The 1905 courthouse burned in 1923, and after much wrangling, voters approved the construction of a new courthouse in 1925. Frederick D. Madison of Royal Oak, Michigan, was selected as architect and F. R. Patterson Construction Company, also of Royal Oak, was selected as the contractor. Work began in 1925, and was completed in 1926. A new matching jail, also designed by Madison, was constructed in 1930‚Äì1931. A new county building was constructed in 1966, and some county functions were moved, but the main courthouse remained in use. An addition to the jail was constructed in 1971. In 1999, ground was broken on a substantial addition. Renovation of the 1931 courthouse was also carried out, and the building was rededicated in 1923. Description The Genesee County Courthouse is a five-story, rectangular, Classical Revival, reinforced concrete-frame building. It is faced in Indiana limestone. The main facade is divided visually into three horizontal bands. The two-story base is finished in stone and capped with a classical cornice. Atop that is a two-story section containing a row of monumental extending across the central section of the facade. Atop the columns is a classical entablature, above which is a massive flat-topped parapet. On the interior, the older section of the courthouse contains seven courtrooms. Nearby is the former county jail, which is a six- story building, which is constructed in a similar scale, and from similar materials, as the courthouse.

History  On June 22, 1937, the Extraordinary III Congress of Soviets of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR adopted the Constitution of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR, which contained the description of the emblem of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR. The coat of arms of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR was identical to the emblem of the RSFSR, but was supplemented with inscriptions in the national languages of the Checheno- Ingush ASSR. = Liqudation and restoration of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR= On March 3, 1944 (other sources says March 7, 1944), on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the republic was disbanded and its population forcibly deported upon the accusations of collaboration with the invaders and separatism. The territory of the ASSR was divided between Stavropol Krai (where Grozny Okrug was formed), the Dagestan ASSR, the North Ossetian ASSR, and the Georgian SSR. On 9 January 1957, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Checheno-Ingush ASSR was restored. = Restoration of the emblem = The emblem of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR was also restored on 1957, following a decree about the emblem of the Checheno-Ingush ASSR.
