Phatak, (born 2 April 1948) is an Indian computer scientist and academic, and a recipient of the Padma Shri Award for his contribution in science and technology in 2013. He is known for his notable work for upgrading Aakash, advertised by its manufacturer as the 'world's cheapest tablet'. In 2009, he was ranked one of the 50 most powerful people in India. Phatak completed secondary school at Dayanand Arya Vidyalaya, graduated third in his class with a degree in electrical engineering from Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science (SGSITS) Indore, completed his master of engineering (specialising in instrumentation, control and computers), and received his PhD in computer science from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. His thesis was titled Digital Simulation and Identification of Linear Continuous Systems.  Career  Born on April 1948, Professor Phatak obtained his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from SGSITS Indore in 1969, and his M Tech and Ph D from IIT Bombay. Phatak has worked at IIT Bombay since 1 December 1971. From 1991 to 1994, he was the Head of the Department of Computer Science; from 1995 to 1998, he was the Dean of Resource Development; from 1998 to 2002, he was the Head of the Kanwal Rekhi School of Information Technology; in 2004 and 2005, he was head of Shailesh J Mehta School of Management; and he is currently the Subrao Nilekani Chair Professor of the KReSIT/department of CSE. In 1983 and 1984, he was part of a deputation to Shri Govindram Seksaria Institute of Technology and Science in Indore to set up computer science programs. During 2003 and 2004, he was on sabbatical leave writing an e-book and touring the country visiting engineering colleges.  Research interests  His research interests include databases and information systems, software engineering, system performance evaluation, IT enabled education, and IT strategy planning. He has guided six PhD candidates, over one hundred master's level students, and several bachelor's level students. Development projects =Aircraft maintenance training simulator= In the late 1980s, India's Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) sponsored a program to develop a 'soft panel'-based (that is, personal computer-based) simulator to train technicians and engineers in the rigorous maintenance procedures required by complex aircraft systems such as were present in the then-new HAL Tejas. 'Hard-panel' training simulators were available only from western markets and were very costly. The ADA chose Phatak's pilot project over two other options because it permitted greater flexibility. In 1996, work began on a 12-year project to develop a full-fledged product with Computer Vision Laboratories (now known as VISIONLABS). It is now deployed in the Indian Air Force. The ADA has showcased the simulator and it was short-listed for a national award. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited the ADA lab and complimented the team for their successful efforts. =Development of smart card technology= Recognizing that smart cards are essentially low-cost computers without a monitor or keyboard, Dr Phatak started development of meaningful affordable applications of this technology. In 1996, he initiated a national project to deploy this technology for banking debit-credit applications. The project was supported by Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India and multiple vendors. It was piloted around the IIT campus through a special permission by RBI. The standard evolved in the project was accepted as a national standard in 1998. Dr Phatak has continued development work on smart card technology, designing low cost point-of-sale (POS) terminals and a multi- application framework. He was invited to head the national subcommittee for standardisation of multi-application smart cards for payment systems. Specific security issues were addressed and novel deployment schemes were evolved through PhD and MTech level research. The technology, now using the near field communication (NFC) feature built into many modern mobile phones, has been successfully deployed for salary payment to people employed under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. =Surveillance system for the Securities and Exchange Board of India= 2004‚Äì2007 ‚Äì To prevent and catch malpractices such as insider trading in stock markets, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) wanted to deploy a state of art surveillance system. An existing system operational in USA was recommended by experts from the U.S. Agency for International Development, who were advising SEBI. After consulting Dr Phatak on the question, Indian regulatory provisions. The national surveillance system which has since been implemented, is considered today as one of the best in the world. It has cost less than one third of the original estimate of over Rs. 50 crore, and handles the world's third largest volume of daily trades. =Ekalavya Project and e-outreach program= Dr Phatak terms all these people modern Ekalavyas, and started a project to help them use modern technology. Initially it aimed to provide web-based mentoring to final year computer engineering students of colleges for their project work. The condition was that they must release their work in open source, so that their work could later be built upon by others. The mentors were initially his research scholars and some industry professionals. This program started receiving annual funding from the industry. Participation has grown from some 100 students from 12 colleges, to more than 3500 students from over 370 colleges supported by over 200 volunteer mentors from industry and academia. Another important initiative launched by the project is creation and dissemination of open source audio-visual educational content. With his encouragement, the IITB School of Management set up the India Centre for Creative Commons, which provides open source license terms for the content. Encouraged by the success of that project, Phatak planned a massive pilot project to run a training program sponsored by the Indian Society for Technical Education program, intended to train up to 1,000 engineering teachers across the country simultaneously. =Indigenous development of clicker devices= Phatak developed a \\"clicker,\\" a portable, handheld device intended for student or presentation environments, designed to allow participants to submit answers to a quiz or poll by clicking on one of a set number of choices. The instructor uses a wireless receiver that collects answers sent by students' clickers; these are then collected for analysis by custom software.

Superior Court, 1 Cal. 4th 617 (1992), was a Supreme Court of California case in which the court‚Äôs decision held that restaurants, grocery stores, and other food service establishments in California can be held liable for injuries sustained by patrons from foreign objects‚Äîincluding natural food parts‚Äîthat are left in food. Background William L. Berg represented Jack A. Clark in the 1992 case of Mexicali Rose v. Superior Court‚Äîa Supreme Court of California case that changed state and consumer law. While Clark was dining at a restaurant, a one-inch chicken bone that was left in his chicken enchilada became lodged in his throat. The bone caused Clark to suffer serious injuries, and he needed three throat operations to repair the damage. As a result of his injuries, Clark filed a lawsuit against the restaurant‚ÄîMexicali Rose‚Äîas well as its owner.Justia.com Opinion of the Court Originally filed in the Alameda County Superior Court, the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court of California. The justices presiding over the case, including Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, ruled in a majority opinion that the restaurant was negligent by leaving the bone in the enchilada, which overturned the precedent established in Mix v. Ingersoll Candy Co. (1936) 6 Cal.2d 674 [59 P.2d 144], a case that set the previous standard for restaurant liability.Stanford Law Mix v. Ingersoll Candy Co. found that restaurant owners could only be considered negligent if foreign substances were left in food, but natural food parts, such as bones, should be expected. Legacy As a result of this ruling, as well as subsequent rulings based on this case, restaurants and grocery stores in California are held accountable to stricter safety standards‚Äîincluding inspections‚Äîto make food safer for customers.Berkeley Law References Further reading Text opinion of Mexicali Rose v.

She writes short stories and has had three novels published; Hungry, the Stars and Everything, Animals and Adults. Education Unsworth grew up in Prestwich and attended Bowker Vale Infant School and Crumpsall Lane Junior School before becoming a pupil at Bury Grammar School for Girls. It was at Bury Grammar that she met writer Sherry Ashworth, then a teacher, who became a mentor and friend and who later published Unsworth's first novel under her Hidden Gem Press imprint. Unsworth studied English Literature at the University of Liverpool and graduated with an MA from Manchester University's Centre for New Writing. Early work Author Emma Jane Unsworth (sat in middle) with members of the Curious Tales collective, Beth Ward, Tom Fletcher, Jenn Ashworth and Richard Hirst in 2013. Unsworth's short fiction has been published in various places including by Comma Press, and her story I Arrive First was included in The Best British Short Stories 2012, published by Salt. She has also worked as a journalist and is a former columnist for The Big Issue in the North. Novels =Hungry, the Stars and Everything= Her debut novel Hungry, the Stars and Everything, was published in June 2011 by Hidden Gem Press and won a Betty Trask Award from the Society of Authors. The novel was also shortlisted for the Portico Prize for Fiction 2012. Set in a restaurant called Bethel, the novel follows the life of restaurant critic Helen as she eats her way through a tasting menu, evoking memories. Unsworth used the name Bethel for her setting after her friend, the chef Mary-Ellen McTague, had considered but rejected using it for her new restaurant Aumbry which she opened in Prestwich. The following year Unsworth and McTague worked together to create a real life version of the meal featured in the book as part of Prestwich Book Festival. The event was held at Aumbry, with diners able to eat some of the dishes that appeared in the novel whilst Unsworth read extracts of her book at intervals throughout the meal. =Animals= In May 2014 Unsworth's second novel, Animals, was published in 2014. The book follows the hedonistic adventures of two young women, best friends Laura and Tyler, as they live their lives in a fog of alcohol and drugs, before circumstances and their friendships start to change. The book received positive reviews, with writer Caitlin Moran describing it as \\"Withnail for Girls\\" and declaring that she wished she had written it. The Guardian praised Unsworth as \\"a tremendous talent\\". The New York Times praised the novel as \\"an emotionally complex and often go-for-broke-witty book\\". The book was later optioned by BAFTA-nominated producer Sarah Brocklehurst and awarded BFI funding with Unsworth tasked with writing the screenplay. The film, directed by Australian director Sophie Hyde, starring Holliday Grainger and filmed in Dublin, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2019. Curious Tales Collective In 2013 Unsworth collaborated with writers Alison Moore, Jenn Ashworth, Tom Fletcher and Richard Hirst to produce a collection of Christmas ghost stories, published as The Longest Night. The edition was limited to 300 copies and the writers performed atmospheric readings in venues which included one in a supposedly haunted room which had previously been used as a morgue, in The Church Inn, Prestwich. The following year, the Curious Tales Collective released a second volume of short stories entitled Poor Souls Light which celebrated the centenary of Robert Aickman and saw contributions from the original group of writers, plus guest writers M John Harrison and Johnny Mains. The edition again had a limited run, this time with 500 copies published. Both works contained illustrations by artist Beth Ward. Other work In November 2014 Unsworth took part in Manchester Central Library's Chaos to Order season which involved musicians and artists taking over the newly refurbished library for a week and organising a diverse range of events. Unsworth became the Writer in Residence and spent the week running drop-in writing workshops, Q&A; sessions with contemporary writers from around the UK, and daily readings of Frank O'Hara's Lunch Poems.

Educated at Jarrow Grammar School, she then attended Skerry's College in Newcastle until 1937, training for a career in the civil service. In 1942, she married Oswald James Bolam, a bookkeeper in the shipyards, and took the name Bolam.England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1916-2005 Career and politics Bolam became a member of the Conservative Party in 1939. The next year, she was made vice chairman of the Jarrow Imperial League. She worked as a civil servant until 1942, when she returned to Jarrow Grammar School to become secretary to the headmaster. In 1945, at age 26, she became the youngest member in history of the Jarrow Town Council. In 1953, she was elected to serve as the representative for Jarrow on Durham County Council, defeating a Labour Party member to take the role. That same year, she founded the Jarrow branch of the Young Conservatives and assisted Stanley Holmes (later Baron Dovercourt) in the general election. In 1947, she volunteered at the Jarrow by-election when William Scott stood as the Conservative candidate. In 1947, she left the grammar school to devote her life full-time to politics, which was taking up more of her time. In the 1950 and 1951 general elections she was a housewife when she contested Houghton-le- Spring, but was defeated both times by Billy Blyton of the Labour party. She earned a reputation as a strong speaker, and served on many committees and speakers' panels. She held various positions within the Jarrow Conservative Association, including chair twice and treasurer.

Personal life  Alwan was born in an Arabian village in Khuzestan, and during his adolescence he was deeply interested in tragic voices. Initially he constructed a rabab out of an empty drum of oil and a few horse hairs, then used this instrument to accompany his singing. In his adulthood he moved to the nearby city of Ahwaz with his wife and daughter Shahla. In most of his songs, Alwan made use of epic or ethical poems, and he sang poems written by historical or contemporary poets, as well he recited the names of the poets as he was singing the poems.khoznews website His songs predominately encouraged the people to display virtues such as courage, generosity, patience. Other themes include forgiveness, as well as to care for relatives, fight injustice, and help the poor.ÿßŸáŸÑ ÿØ€åÿ±Ÿáÿå Ÿæ⁄òŸàŸáÿ¥€å ÿØÿ± ŸÅÿ±ŸáŸÜ⁄Ø ÿπÿßŸÖŸá ŸÖÿ±ÿØŸÖ ÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿÆŸàÿ≤ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜÿå ÿ®ŸÜ€å ÿ≥ÿπ€åÿØÿå ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿßŸÖÿßŸÜÿå ÿ¨ŸÑÿØ ÿØŸàŸÖÿå ŸÜÿ¥ÿ± ÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸàÿßÿå €±€≥€∏€∏ÿå ÿµŸÅÿ≠Ÿá €∏€∂Townspeople.

The author was awarded the 1937 Nobel Prize for Literature largely on the basis of this novel sequence. Plot summary 1\\\\. Le cahier gris (\\"The Grey Notebook\\") opens in Paris around 1904. School officials have discovered a notebook containing messages between Jacques Thibault and a Protestant fellow schoolboy, Daniel de Fontanin. The notebooks give evidence of a passionate, but not evidently sexual, relationship between the two. Expecting that the notebook will be misinterpreted, the two run away to Marseille, intending to travel to North Africa by ship. Jacques's father Oscar Thibault, a stern Catholic grand bourgeois, dispatches his older son, Antoine, a medical student, to retrieve his younger brother. In Marseille and unable to find a ship that will accept them, Jacques and Daniel are separated. Daniel is taken in by an older woman, who seduces him. In Paris, Daniel's younger sister Jenny is seriously ill and his mother learns that her husband J√©r√¥me's infidelities have included an affair with her cousin No√©mie. Antoine visits the de Fontanins and concludes that Jenny is beyond medical help. Jenny recovers after the intervention of an English Christian Science faith healer. Antoine brings the boys back to Paris where Daniel is greeted warmly by his mother. Jacques's father sends him to a reformatory and forbids him to have further contact with Daniel. 2\\\\. Le p√©nitencier (\\"The Prison\\" or \\"The Reformatory\\") resumes the narrative several months later. Antoine visits Jacques in the reformatory at Crouy, where he is disturbed by the boy's isolation and ill-treatment. Determined to rescue him, he confronts his father, who reacts with rage but is eventually persuaded to allow Jacques to be released and to live away from his father's roof under Antoine's supervision. Against his father's wishes, Antoine permits Jacques to see Daniel and his family, and the boys' friendship is renewed, though it becomes less intense. Jenny de Fontanin quickly takes a dislike to Jacques, who in the meantime has fallen in love with an Alsatian girl, Lisbeth, who is serving as the brothers' housekeeper and who, unbeknownst to Jacques, is having an affair with Antoine. Daniel, in the meantime, is attracted to his cousin Nicole (the daughter of No√©mie), but she repulses his advances. Lisbeth and Jacques consummate their relationship, but soon afterwards she returns to Alsace, leaving him devastated. 3\\\\. La belle saison picks up the narrative approximately five years later. Jacques learns that he has been accepted to the √âcole normale, apparently securing his future prospects. To celebrate, the brothers and Daniel agree to meet at a nightclub, where Daniel is introduced to a young woman, known as Rinette, who is being debuted as a prostitute in hopes of securing a wealthy patron (Daniel‚Äôs employer Ludwigson, an art dealer). Rinette has some time earlier given birth to a child out of wedlock, who subsequently died. Disregarding the plan, Daniel leaves the club in the company of Rinette, who tells him that he looks familiar and asks him his name. When she learns his identity she is horrified and starts to flee, but then changes her mind and astonishes Daniel by declaring that she wants to have his baby. In the meantime, we learn that Antoine, who has not arrived at the club, had been called out to tend to a young girl who has been gravely injured in an accident. While performing life-saving surgery in the apartment where the girl lives he is assisted by a neighbor, Rachel, with whom he soon begins a passionate affair. Mme. de Fontanin receives an urgent summons from her husband J√©r√¥me, who is living in Holland with No√©mie. No√©mie has fallen ill and soon dies. With Mme de Fontanin absent, Jacques and Jenny go on a long walk together, during which they share their concerns over Daniel, who, like his father, has become something of a womanizer. Jenny finds herself increasingly conflicted about her feelings towards Jacques, and when her mother returns from Holland, with J√©r√¥me in tow, she breaks down sobbing, though she can't bring herself to fully confess her emotions. J√©r√¥me, who is revealed as the father of Rinette's baby, receives a previously undelivered letter, dated two years earlier, in which she appeals for his aid. He now goes to her, gives her money, and sends her off to Brittany. Rachel tells Antoine about the dark chapters in her past, including the suicide of her brother and the death of her infant daughter, and reveals her relationship to a sinister man named Hirsch. Finally she leaves Antoine to rejoin Hirsch in Africa. 4\\\\. La consultation, begins after a lapse of roughly three years. It is now 1913; Antoine has a thriving medical practice, Jacques has disappeared under circumstances that are not yet clear, and their father is terminally ill. The de Fontanins have receded, for now, into a peripheral role. Much of the narrative centers on Antoine's patients; one of these, a gravely ill infant, is the daughter of Daniel's cousin Nicole, who is now married to a physician named H√©quet. Antoine attempts to make a declaration of love to Gise, the half-Malagasy teenage niece of his father's housekeeper, but she is secretly in love with Jacques, whom she is determined to find. 5\\\\. La sorellina begins with Jacques unaccounted for. His ailing father believes that he has committed suicide, but Antoine discovers that someone using the name \\"Jack Baulthy\\" has recently published a novella in a Swiss magazine and quickly determines that the author is his brother. Written in a florid style and set in Italy, the novella, which itself is entitled La sorellina (\\"The Little Sister\\" in Italian) proves to be a roman √† clef. Its hero, Giuseppe, has defied his devoutly Catholic father and fallen in love with a young English Protestant named Sybil (based on Jenny); but he has also developed an ardent‚Äîand reciprocated‚Äîattraction for his younger sister Annetta, a character clearly modeled on Gise. The novella ends with Giuseppe's flight, after a confrontation with his father during which he vows to kill himself. Antoine travels to Lausanne, finds Jacques, who has become embroiled in radical politics, and persuades him to return with him to Paris to see their father before he dies. 6\\\\. La mort du p√®re (\\"The Death of the Father\\") opens as the brothers take a train back to Paris, but Oscar Thibault is now so ill and close to death that he isn‚Äôt aware of Jacques's presence. At the climax of a long and meticulously described deathbed scene, Antoine finally administers a dose of morphine to accelerate the inevitable. With Oscar dead, Antoine goes through his father's papers and effects and finds some photographs and letters that suggest that he may secretly have developed a sentimental attachment of some kind to another woman in the years after his wife's death. Gise has returned from London; although she hasn't seen Jacques for three years she remains desperately in love with him, but Jacques makes it clear that her feelings are not reciprocated. Oscar Thibault is buried with great ceremony in a cemetery adjacent to the reformatory he founded at Crouy. Jacques doesn't attend the funeral but makes a trip on his own to visit his father's grave; an unidentified older woman leaves flowers there at the same time. He receives a long letter from Daniel, who is away from Paris doing his military service and who ardently implores Jacques to renew their friendship. 7\\\\. l'√ât√© 1914 (\\"Summer 1914\\"), the longest of the eight volumes, is set in the period leading up to and including the beginning of World War I. Antoine Thibault is now a well-to-do physician who is having an affair with a married woman, Anne de Battaincourt; his brother Jacques, on the other hand, is a committed socialist who spends much of his time among radical political circles in Geneva. Much of the narrative centers on the activities of the various socialist and radical groups in the face of the possible outbreak of war between the great powers of Europe. Daniel de Fontanin, by now a promising painter, is continuing his military service, but is called home when his father, J√©r√¥me, commits suicide after being accused of embezzlement. Daniel and Jacques, who have not seen each other for some time, meet again in Paris, but their friendship is strained by the diverging paths their lives are taking. Madame de Fontanin resolves to travel to Vienna to try to straighten out her late husband's business affairs and salvage the family's reputation. While she is absent, Jacques and Jenny de Fontanin, overcoming their apparent longstanding antipathy to each other, become lovers, and while dining together witness the assassination of the antiwar socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s by a French nationalist. With Jaur√®s gone, popular opposition to war collapses and the armies of the European powers are mobilized. Disgusted by the failure of the Left to stop the war, Jacques, who refuses to fight under any circumstances, escapes to Switzerland with false papers, while Jenny remains in Paris, intending to join him later. Deciding to sacrifice himself in the name of stopping the war, Jacques and a comrade named Meynestrel hatch a plan to fly over the battlefield in a small plane and drop antiwar leaflets on both sides. After the plane crashes, killing Meynestrel, Jacques, gravely injured, is seized as a spy by French soldiers and is summarily executed as the overwhelmed troops beat a hasty retreat. 8\\\\. Epilogue centers on Antoine Thibault and is set in 1918. Publication history The first six parts of The Thibaults, ending with La Mort du p√®re (\\"The Death of the Father\\"), were published in installments between 1922 and 1929. Martin du Gard was well underway on a seventh, to be called l'Appareillage (\\"Setting Sail\\") when he was injured in an automobile accident. While recuperating, he decided that he was dissatisfied with the direction the novel was taking, destroyed the unpublished manuscript, and wrote the final two parts, which appeared in 1936 and 1940. A partial English-language translation of The Thibaults by Madeleine Boyd appeared in 1926; another partial version, by Stephen Haden Guest, followed in 1933. A complete translation, by Stuart Gilbert, appeared in 1939-1941; this edition gathered the first six parts under the title The Thibaults and assigned the final two parts to a separate volume entitled Summer 1914.Classe, Olive, ed. Encyclopedia of Literary Translation Into English, Volume 2 The Gilbert translation does not use the individual titles of the novel's first six parts. Reception and influence Popular and critical opinion of The Thibaults has in general been more positive in Europe than in the United States. The novel was admired by Andr√© Gide, a longtime friend, and by Albert Camus,Lyrical and Critical Essays Clifton Fadiman,The New Yorker, 1941 and Georg Lukacs,Realism in Our Time, trans. J. & N Mander (New York, 1964), pp. 59-60,75, and 83. but Mary McCarthy called it \\"a work whose learned obtuseness is, so far as I know, unequaled in fiction.\\"The New Republic, 26 April 1939 The implied anti-war message of Summer 1914, parts of which trace the failure of the international socialist community to overcome nationalism and prevent the onset of the First World War, may have affected the reception of the English-language translation, which was released during the early stages of World War II. The novel has been filmed twice for television in France, but its English-language translation is currently out- of-print in the US and Great Britain. Andr√© Gide acknowledged the influence of The Thibaults on his own novel, The Counterfeiters.Andr√© Gide, Roger Martin Du Gard: Correspondance, 1913-1934 It has also been suggested that the novel influenced Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, another novel that centers on an intense relationship between two young men of opposing religious backgrounds.Burch, Francis F. \\"Robert Hugh Benson, Roger Martin du Gard and Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited.\\" Notes and Queries 37.1 (1990): 68.

Kendermore Kendermore, written by Mary Kirchoff, is the second novel in the Preludes series. In this novel, Tasslehoff Burrfoot is charged with violating the kender laws of prearranged marriage, and forced to return to Kendermore due to the imprisonment of his Uncle Trapspringer. The novel begins with the character of Tasslehoff Burrfoot at the Inn of the Last Home with his friends. However, soon a bounty hunter arrives and charges him for desertion for violating the laws of prearranged marriage. A journey east turns into a voyage with gully dwarves. Meanwhile, in Kendermore, Tas's Uncle Trapspringer and a human \\"doctor\\" have found a map leading to a treasure. Tas is having his own adventures after a shipwreck strands him, Gisella (the bounty hunter), and Woodrow (Gisella's assistant) near a dwarven settlement. Tas is captured by gnomes, who seek to turn him into an exhibit. Woodrow saves him with help from Winnie, a wooly mammoth. Gisella is killed by Denzil, an assassin.

Lycanthropes do not exist on Krynn. =Reviews= *Review by Scott Winnett (1989) in Locus, #345 October 1989http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?17091 Brothers Majere Brothers Majere, written by Kevin Stein, is the third volume in the original Preludes series. This novel explores the love/hate relationship between the brothers Caramon and Raistlin as developed in the Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Raistlin is unable to forgive Caramon for allowing his ailing mother to die, or forgive himself for his inability to save her with his magic. Raistlin agrees to pursue their mother¬í's last wish, but he is unaware that they are pawns in a power struggle between the gods. =Reception= John C. Bunnell reviewed Brothers Majere for Dragon magazine, calling it \\"narrowly the best of the Dragonlance Preludes\\", and noted that part of the success of the Dragonlance line \\"has been a product of its carefully stylized atmosphere; Stein captures the mood more accurately than have some recent writers.\\" Riverwind the Plainsman Riverwind the Plainsman was written by Paul B. Thompson and Tonya R. Carter. It is the first volume in the Preludes II series, and the fourth volume in the overall Preludes series. This novel relates the courting quest of Riverwind for the hand Goldmoon. Riverwind, who had fallen out of favor with Goldmoon'¬ís father, chief of the Que-Shu tribe, because of Riverwind's belief in the old gods. Riverwind is given the task of discovering proof of the existence of his gods and return with irrefutable evidence. Flint the King Flint The King was written by Mary Kirchoff and Douglas Niles. It is the second volume in the Preludes II series, and the fifth volume in the overall Preludes series. The main character is Flint Fireforge, hill dwarf and future War of the Lance hero. In the novel, he returns to his old hometown, Hillhome, where he uncovers a murder mystery that involves a member of his own family.¬î Flint the King was the first collaborative writing effort for authors Mary Kirchoff and Doug Niles, with Niles stating: \\"¬ìIt doesn¬í't mean that you do only half the work [...] ¬ìEach of us did more than write half a book, but I think we came up with a better story because of it.¬î\\" According to Kirchoff, \\"we assumed that our strengths and weaknesses would offset each other. Doug does great battles and magic, and my strengths tend to be characters and dialogue, and that'¬ís worked out very nicely.¬î\\" According to Kirchoff, \\"¬ìThe first time I tried to make Flint talk, he just sat there with his lips moving. I paced around the house and drank another cup of coffee, but I just couldn¬ít make words come out of his mouth.¬î\\" Her editor suggested she assign some famous personality the role of Flint, and she ended up choosing Wilfred Brimley and Yosemite Sam. Tanis, the Shadow Years Tanis, the Shadow Years was written by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel. It is the third volume in the Preludes II series, and the sixth volume in the overall Preludes series. In this novel, Tanis travels into the memory of an old, dying mage at his request, in search of the old man¬í's long-lost love. The mage desperately wants his love to live on after him, so ¬ìTanis has to find her and return to the present before the old mage dies.¬î References Category:20th-century American novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:Dragonlance novel series ","title":"Preludes (Dragonlance series)"},{"id":"38356833","text":"Samantha Poling is a Scottish investigative journalist, currently working for BBC Scotland and BBC Panorama. Early life and career Raised in Helensburgh, after graduation Poling joined the Northumberland Gazette in Alnwick as a trainee reporter. She returned to Scotland in 1995, working on the Helensburgh Advertiser. In 1996, she moved to the national press, covering stories such as the Dunblane massacre and reporting from Paris on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Career =BBC Scotland= In 1998 she joined BBC Scotland, and later became the channel's Health Correspondent. She still works for the channel on BBC Scotland Investigates. In 2002 she moved into investigative journalism, making the film The Untouchable about a senior police officer who had raped and stalked women who he had met through his work. He was later jailed for 12 years for the attacks. She then joined Frontline, making investigative films, including the award-winning Critical Error which investigated overdoses in radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients in hospitals around the UK, which prompted changes in the way radiotherapy dosages are delivered. She later spent time in Iraq filming a documentary about the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and travelled to India to examine the call centre industry for a programme about banking. In 2004, Poling made the multi-award-winning film Security Wars, in which she went undercover to expose a cartel of gunmen and convicted murderers involved in lucrative national security contracts. The film forced the legislative tightening-up of security legislation, and won Poling the first of her three BAFTAs. In October 2012, Poling filmed Britain‚Äôs Private War, which exposed flaws in G4S's security vetting procedures. These directly led to contractor Daniel Fitzsimons killing Paul McGuigan from Peebles and Australian Darren Hoare in a vodka-fuelled squabble, only 36 hours after he had arrived in Baghdad's highly securitised Green Zone. =BBC Panorama= In 2008 she joined BBC Panorama and made the programme Britain's Protection Racket, which exposed the Security Industry Authority as being deeply flawed. She then made Crime Pays while working undercover in 2009, which included an interview with the UK's leading cocaine trafficker telling her how he laundered his money from deals in Estonia, to show how organised crime was defeating government attempts to claw back its profits. Poling won her third BAFTA for the investigation. In 2010, she wrote, filmed and created Can I Sack Teacher?, about the fact that only 18 UK teachers had been struck off for incompetence in the previous 40 years. In 2011, she exposed petrol-laundering gangs in Northern Ireland, and exposed the quality issues within the surgical instrument manufacturing industry in Pakistan that were supplying in bulk to the National Health Service. In Smoking and the Bandits, she exposed the UK's counterfeit cigarette gangs, was attacked while filming in Barras market, and discovered record levels of toxins in the products. =Other programmes= In 2015, she presented The Dog Factory, a one-off programme about the puppy farm industry for BBC One.

It was originally created to categorize four basic learning styles using the colors blue, orange, gold and green to identify the strengths and challenges of these core personality types.Gregory, Gale H. (2005).  Personality profiling system  According to this personality temperament theory, which is a refined version of the popular Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), everyone's personality consists of a combination of all four colors, with the dominant two colors representing the core of a person's personality temperament.Thomsen, Kate. (2002). In general, green personality types are independent thinkers, gold personality types are pragmatic planners, orange personality types are very action-oriented, and blue personality types are very people-oriented.Shuttleworth, Dale Edwin (1993). The idea behind True Colors is that it does not pigeonhole people into one personality type over another with the understanding that one's personality might make adjustments based on his or her environment or associations. True Colors is a way to understand the behaviors and motivations of others relative to our own personalities to help mitigate potential conflict by learning to recognize personality differences and characteristics.DiTullio, Lisa. (2011). = Scientific basis = Results from the correlations of a 2006 study of the True Colors system (Wichard, 2006),Whichard, Judith A. (2006). Reliability and Validity of True Colors show that True Colors has convergent validity with the MBTI . Convergent validity is when a measure is more strongly associated with measures of similar constructs. However, True Colors did not have convergent validity with the Strong Interest Inventory (SII), or the Campbell Interest and Skill Survey (CISS). Furthermore, subjects rated the predictions that the True Colors system made about them as accurate. However, this could be the result of hindsight bias and/or confirmation bias. Subjects retested after a 30 to 50 day delay were given the same classification ~95% of the time. However, the research was performed by an 11-year True Colors Certified Trainer, the research was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, and there are no published replications.

In a racing career which lasted from 1954 until 1956 he ran at least thirteen times and won six races. As a three-year-old in 1955 he won the Prix de Guiche and the Prix Greffulhe in France before winning the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Champion Stakes in Britain. He was disappointing for most of the following season but produced what was arguably his best performance when finishing second under top weight in the Cambridgeshire Handicap. He made no impact at stud. When racing in Britain and later while standing as a stallion in the United States, the horse was known as Hafiz II. Background Hafiz was a big, powerful chestnut horse with four white feet bred in France by the Aga Khan in partnership with his son Prince Aly Khan. During the early part of his racing career he was owned by the Aga Khan and trained at Chantilly by Alec Head. Hafiz was a difficult horse to manage, with a nervous, excitable disposition, and often sweated heavily before the start of his races. He was sired by Nearco, an undefeated Italian champion who went on to become one of the most important sires of the 20th century. His dam, Double Rose, was a top class racemare who finished second in the 1949 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in the colours of Aly Khan's wife, Rita Hayworth. Racing career =1954: two- year-old season= Hafiz was not highly tried as a two-year-old. He finished second in the Prix de Saint-Firmin over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and then won a minor race at Maisons-Laffitte. At the end of the season a half share in the colt was sold to the American breeder Larry MacPhail. =1955: three-year-old season= In the spring of 1955, Hafiz established himself as one of the leading French colts with wins in two important trial races at Longchamp: the Prix Greffulhe over 2000 metres and the Prix de Guiche over 1950 metres. In June he was sent to Britain to contest the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom but despite being considered a serious contender he finished unplaced behind another French challenger Phil Drake. Hafiz returned to Britain in autumn and recorded his two most important victories. In September he appeared at Ascot where he produced a \\"great finishing sprint\\" to win the inaugural running of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile. In the following month he started at odds of 100/30 for the Champion Stakes over one and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse. Ridden by Roger Poincelet he won from the 1954 2000 Guineas winner Darius and the Irish Derby winner Panaslipper. =1956: four-year-old season= Before the start of the new season, MacPhail bought out the remaining half-share in the colt for ¬£70,000. Hafiz did not win any major events in 1956 (his only success was in the Prix d'Automne) but he enhanced his reputation in two of his defeats. After running poorly in the Prix Ganay he finished second in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot, beaten lengths when attempting to concede six pounds to the leading British four-year-old Hugh Lupus. Following unplaced runs in the Eclipse Stakes (for which he started favourite) and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes his connections took the unusual decision to end the season with a run in the Cambridgeshire Handicap over nine furlongs at Newmarket. Although the race had been won by many champions in the past, by the 1950s it had become common practice for top-class European horses to compete almost exclusively in weight-for-age events. Carrying top weight of 133 pounds, Hafiz was ridden by the Australian jockey Rae Johnstone and started at odds of 10/1. In what Alec Head described as a \\"wonderful performance\\" Hafiz finished second by half a length to a four-year-old gelding named Loppylugs, to whom he was conceding 27 pounds. Assessment The independent Timeform awarded Hafiz a peak rating of 136 in 1956, making him their second highest-rated horse behind Ribot. Stud record At the end of 1956, Hafiz was sold to a syndicate for $384,000 and exported to stand as a stallion in the United States. He sent to MacPhail's Glenangus Farm before being moved to Lexington, Kentucky. He appears to have had very little success as a breeding stallion, siring few winners and nothing of top class. Hafiz died in 1971.

However, unlike previous primaries, voting took place at a public meeting rather than by postal ballot. At the time, the seat was held by Glenda Jackson, a long serving Labour MP and as due to the close race in 2010, was the Conservatives' number one target seat at the 2015 election. Background At the 2010 general election, the incumbent MP Glenda Jackson retained her seat by just 42 votes, the closest margin in England out of all the election results in that election. However, in June 2011, she announced that she would retire from politics, presuming that the Coalition Government survived to 2015. On 13 December 2012, the Hampstead and Kilburn Conservative Association announced that the selection of the party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate would be opened up to the public, including those not affiliated with the Conservative Party. The three shortlisted candidates were announced on the same day. During the campaign, the three candidates met with constituents at stalls to answer questions and raise awareness of the vote. Candidates * Alex Burghart, Director of Policy at the Centre for Social Justice.

Built in a porous local stone, it was covered in stucco for protection. History The Aldcliffe estate was acquired by the strongly Catholic Dalton family in 1557 during the reign of Queen Mary after it had been confiscated from Syon Priory by the Crown. The purchaser, Robert Dalton, High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1577, left it to his son, also Robert Dalton. The younger Dalton had ten devout daughters, many of whom lived together at Aldcliffe, causing the hall to be given the name \\"Hall of the Catholic Virgins.\\" Because of their adherence to the Catholic faith, two thirds of their land was sequestered by Parliament during the English Civil War. The last two surviving sisters left the property to the clergy who had been running a teaching mission at the house. In 1716, after an enquiry, the land was confiscated by the crown due to popish activities. It was bought by Richard Leigh of Newton-in-Bowland and passed via his son Richard to the latter's son Benjamin. Benjamin left it to his daughter Isobel and her husband Robert Dawson. After Robert's death in 1769, his widow Isobel continued to live at the house for another 12 years, together with her son John, who married and had an only son, Edward Dawson (1793‚Äì1976). In 1817, Edward built the new hall slightly uphill from the old hall, which he demolished to provide some of the building material. He also constructed an embankment to reclaim 160 acres of marshland. By 1827 he had improved the house by adding a drive, a lodge and a tree lined carriageway and landscaped the surrounding countryside with spinneys and a tree plantation. He died in 1876 and the estate passed to his son Edward Bousfield Dawson. Edward Bousfield extended the house by adding a castellated wing, installed electricity and also allowed the Glasson Dock Branch railway line to cross the estate. In 1904 he was made Constable of Lancaster Castle. His two sons died before maturity and so the property was divided, the land going to his grandson and the hall going to his daughter, Mary Philadelphia, who lived with him until his death in 1916 and then in her own right until her death in 1945. The hall and its surrounding gardens passed to her nephew Eric Edward Hall, a mining engineer, who assumed by deed poll the surname of Dawson-Hall. In 1946, the contents of the hall were sold and it became a hostel for displaced foreign workers in 1950. In 1953, Eric Dawson- Hall sold the property (the hall and gardens, Home Farm, West Lodge and Ivy Cottage, some 40 acres in all) to Mrs. Muriel Townley, wife of Barton Townley, of Bailrigg. The hall was now disused with the gardens overgrown and was finally demolished in 1960. The land has since been developed for housing. The East Lodge, now a house, is a grade II listed building.

Considered one of the more extreme leftists of the MPRP, he was expelled from the party in 1932 for his role in the \\"Leftist Deviation\\" and exiled to the Soviet Union where he was arrested and shot for counterrevolution in 1941. Biography Shijee was born in present-day Bortala, Xinjiang in 1901. He was a partisan fighter in the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 and then became prison director. In 1923 he joined the MPRP working for the party's Central Committee. Shijee was one of several younger, more radicalized party members from rural areas (others included Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav, √ñlziin Badrakh, Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir, Jambyn Lkh√ºmbe, and Peljidiin Genden) recruited by the Soviets to challenge the authority of the MPRP \\"old guard\\". Soviets enrolled him in the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow and then sent him to agitate Uyghur Hui students and organize supplies of arms and revolutionaries to the Xinjiang region as part of Soviet plans to establish a puppet government there. It was during this period that Shijee first met Badrakh and the two discussed the possibility of creating an autonomous republic of non-Khalkh Mongol regions of D√∂rv√∂d (present day Uvs Province), Tannu Uriankhai, and Xinjiang.Sanders 2010, p. 222 Shijee returned to Mongolia in 1928 and rose within the government through a rapid series of promotions: he was first elected secretary of the Central Council of the Mongolian Trade Unions, then appointed head of Internal Security Directorate from 1928 to 1929, and then made chairman of the board of the State Bank from 1929 to 1930. He was one of several \\"new leftists\\" promoted into party leadership positions during the Eighth Party Congress in 1930, when he was elected member of presidium (or politburo) of the MPRP and one of three secretaries of the party Central Committee (a position he would hold until June 30, 1932). From March 13, 1931 to June 30, 1932 he was first secretary of the Central Committee. Recognized as one of the party's most extreme leftists,Bawden 1989, p. 296 Shijee actively pushed Soviet tailored policies that aggressively forced herders onto collective farms, suppressed private trade, and seized property of both the nobility and the Buddhist church. As a result, one third of Mongolian livestock was decimated, over 800 properties belonging to the nobility and the Buddhist church were confiscated, and approximately 700 heads of mostly noble households were executed. When violent uprisings spread across western Mongolia in 1932 in reaction to the harsh policies, Moscow ordered a curtailment of the unpopular initiatives and pinned the blame for the excesses of what became known as the \\"Leftist Deviation\\" on Shijee and other hard-line leftists within the party leadership, including √ñlziin Badrakh, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav. All were officially expelled from the party in May 1932. Shijee was exiled to Moscow where in 1937 he was arrested on charges of counterrevolution. Shijee's father, a simple herder in Mongolia, was also arrested.Baabar 1999, 363 He was sentenced to death by military collegium of the USSR Supreme Court on July 9, 1941, and shot July 27, 1941.

According to Paul the Deacon this synod issued a letter, written by a Damian later bishop of Pavia, directly to Emperor Constantine IV. A year later Mansuetus and his suffragan bishops participated in Rome to a synod opened by Pope Agatho on 27 march 680 and subscribed the acts there issued.

The film, which aired on PBS, was directed by Gordon Parks with Avery Brooks starring as the titular character. It was the second film to be funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, following A House Divided: Denmark Vesey's Rebellion in 1982. Parks returned to direct the film after years of absence. He chose to work in the Deep South and to collaborate with a crew of mixed races. The film first aired on PBS on , 1984 and as part of PBS's American Playhouse anthology television series in the following year. It was released on video under the title Half Slave, Half Free. Solomon Northup's Odyssey was the first film adaptation of Twelve Years a Slave. A second film adaptation, 12 Years a Slave, directed by Steve McQueen, was released in 2013. Synopsis Solomon Northup's Odyssey is based on the true story of Solomon Northup, a free black man in Saratoga, New York who was kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery (see slavery in the United States). Northup was intelligent, skilled in carpentry, and was able to play music. He was enslaved in the state of Louisiana for before he was released. Cast * Avery Brooks as Solomon Northup *Loretta Greene as Jenny (credited as Rhetta Green) *Petronia Paley as Anne * Joe Seneca as Noah * Michael Tolan as Henry Northup *Janet League *Jay McMillian * Art Evans * Lee Bryant * John Saxon Production Solomon Northup's Odyssey is directed by Gordon Parks, who also composed the film score with Kermit Moore. The television film is based on the autobiography Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup. Lou Potter and Samm-Art Williams wrote the teleplay for the film. The film was produced by The Fremantle Corporation and Past America Inc. The National Endowment for the Humanities provided funding for a series of programs related to American history. Producer Shep Morgan received a planning grant from the NEH in 1976 and sought input from historians including Robert B. Toplin who suggested the topic of American slavery. When the miniseries Roots was aired in 1977, the team was forced to argue to some television executives that there was more to say about American slavery. The first film in the series was A House Divided: Denmark Vesey's Rebellion, about Denmark Vesey, who planned a slave rebellion. The film was aired on PBS in 1982, and Solomon Northup's Odyssey was the next to be produced. Toplin said, \\"While we hoped the Vesey show would throw light on questions about slave insurrections, we designed the Northup film to address questions about life in bondage.\\" Toplin said the film in particular corrected the tendency of Roots and similar media \\"to portray almost all slaveholders as insensitive exploiters\\". Toplin described the various portrayals, \\"[It] showed an African American working under three different masters. One was a kindly individual whose good intentions were undermined by the slave system. A second master was a vicious, poorly educated individual who was jealous of Northup's intelligence and skills. The third respected Northup but drove him hard nevertheless in order to maximize profits on his plantation.\\" Gordon Parks was approached to direct the film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience with the release of his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, \\"Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when you know so much happened that was so bad to so many people. But there were things I had to change.\\" Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured \\"to keep it toned down\\". Parks chose to film in areas of the Deep South where Northup labored in slavery. The director sought to have a crew of mixed races, he said \\"perhaps to show the Southerners how Blacks and Whites could work together\\". In his memoir, Parks recalled the mix: Japanese American cinematographer Hiro Narita, a black producer and assistant director, a mostly white crew, and a black costume lady who was assisted by a woman from Hong Kong. He filmed Solomon Northup's Odyssey in three weeks' time in Savannah, Georgia. Parks said of the final product, \\"I can't say I don't like the film; I think it's a powerful film, but it could have been stronger. But you meet that sort of crisis on every film; there are some sort of compromises you always have to make.\\" Release Solomon Northup's Odyssey first aired on PBS on , 1984. It aired again as part of the PBS anthology television series American Playhouse on , 1985. The film was released on video in 1985 as Half Slave, Half Free. Ebony said the film had the second-largest \\"Black viewership of any PBS show\\", following Denmark Vesey's Rebellion. The magazine said Solomon Northup's Odyssey at the time of airing \\"has been praised by critics who are calling for a theater release as well\\". John Corry of The New York Times said of the film, \\"It gives us an earnest and intelligent depiction, although its real subject‚Äîthe moral effect of slavery‚Äîstays just out of reach. It is almost as if the drama's good taste is keeping it at bay.\\" Corry said the direction obeying the \\"fidelity of history\\" made the setting and the society less harsh: \\"It is not meant this way, but an intolerable institution is made to look almost benign.\\" He commended the performances of Brooks, Green, Saxon, and Seneca and concluded, \\"'Solomon Northrup's Odyssey' [sic] is informative, but whatever else it is, it is not dull.\\" Film critic Gene Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, said Solomon Northup's Odyssey was \\"beautifully filmed\\" with Parks's past experience as a photographer. Siskel also commended Brooks for portraying Northup \\"with nobility and humanity\\". Jeff Jarvis, reviewing for People, said the film was made \\"with remarkable restraint\\". Jarvis said, \\"It is teary stuff. But because Parks and Brooks do not go overboard, they manage to make their picture of slavery seem real. Their show... is extraordinarily effective and moving.\\" Author Alan J. Singer wrote that \\"Solomon Northup's Odyssey... is a much more accurate picture of plantation life and work\\" than the miniseries Roots (1977), which he said had a soap opera quality and that \\"enslaved Africans are rarely shown working\\". For the film, Past America, Inc. received the Erik Barnouw Award from the Organization of American Historians. Legacy The National Endowment for the Humanities said, \\"The [1984] film helped push one of the darkest periods from America‚Äôs past into public consciousness, paving the way for such later movies as Amistad [in 1997], Django Unchained [in 2012], and the most recent adaptation of Northup's memoir... 12 Years a Slave [in 2013], which was lauded for its realistic portrayal of the horror of slavery.\\" When Steve McQueen's adaptation 12 Years a Slave was released, Colorlines noted the obscurity of Solomon Northup's Odyssey, \\"With limited funding, and predating social media, the film came and went with little fanfare.\\" The blog Vulture under the magazine New York compared the film to 12 Years a Slave, \\"As a made-for-TV movie from the mid- eighties, [Solomon Northup's Odyssey] had a very modest budget and could never come close to the brutality of McQueen's film. Yet Parks's film is beautiful in its own right, lacking the ferocious immediacy of McQueen's work, but containing a somber lyricism that's hard to shake. The outrage is still there, just more muted and given more historical context.\\" By 2013, when 12 Years a Slave was released, Vulture said of the 1984 film, \\"Out-of-print videos of it sell for a lot of money nowadays,\\" and that the film was available for streaming online. IndieCollect, a film preservation organization, uncovered an original negative of Solomon Northup's Odyssey from DuArt Film and Video's vault. The company Colorlab created a new print from the negative, and the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration hosted a one-time screening of the new print on , 2014 before IndieCollect donated the print to the Library of Congress for safekeeping.

A sequel to V/H/S, it comprises five found-footage segments linked together by a frame narrative. V/H/S/2 features a largely different group of directors: Jason Eisener, Gareth Evans, Timo Tjahjanto, Eduardo S√°nchez, and Gregg Hale, and franchise returnees Simon Barrett and Adam Wingard. Plot The film is presented as an anthology of short horror films, built into a frame narrative which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of found footage (each segment is from the VHS tapes found in the first film). =Tape 49/frame narrative= : Directed by Simon Barrett A college student's mother requests that a private investigator, Larry, and his girlfriend, Ayesha, also a private investigator, look into the disappearance of her son Kyle. After breaking into Kyle's residence, they discover a large stack of VHS tapes and a laptop that is still recording a video and also contains the tapes from the previous film, including Tape 56. On the laptop, Kyle discusses the VHS tapes, saying where he got one of the most recent ones, and Larry tells Ayesha to watch the tapes while he inspects the house. As Ayesha begins to watch \\"Phase I Clinical Trials\\", a figure peers out from the shadows and watches her. Ayesha calls Larry into the room, and they discuss the tapes' legitimacy. Larry tells Ayesha to continue viewing the tapes, which Kyle's video explains must be watched in the proper order \\"to affect you\\". After she finishes watching \\"A Ride in the Park\\", Larry re-enters the room and finds Ayesha in a hypnotized state with her nose bleeding. After being woken, Ayesha says she has a migraine. Larry leaves to find medicine, and a seemingly entranced Ayesha watches \\"Safe Haven\\". From the shadows, the figure crawls out and watches her. Upon Larry's return, he discovers Ayesha has killed herself with a gun. A VHS tape with the word \\"WATCH\\" written on it in lipstick, lies beside her. Larry picks up the tape containing \\"Slumber Party Alien Abduction\\" and anxiously watches it. Confused, Larry watches the webcam footage and sees Kyle explain that he and his mother want to make their own tape; Kyle then attempts suicide on-camera by shooting himself through his jaw, but seemingly survives, even though his lower jaw is completely shattered, and runs off moments before Larry and Ayesha enter the dorm. As Larry watches it, an undead Ayesha suddenly rises and attacks him. In self-defense, Larry breaks her neck and rushes into the other room as Ayesha chases after him on all fours. Larry hides in a closet and shoots Ayesha in the face when she finds him. Larry hears a strange gurgling sound and explores the closet only to find Kyle hiding in the back, revealing that Kyle has been hiding in the closet the whole time. Kyle lunges at Larry and strangles him to death. Afterward, Kyle gives the camera a \\"thumbs up\\", revealing the plan his mother and he came up with being a success, before turning off the camera. =Phase I Clinical Trials= : Directed by Adam Wingard A man, Herman, is sitting in a doctor's office and the doctor is examining his camera. The camera is fitted into an ocular implant which has replaced Herman's right eye after it was damaged in a car accident. The doctor informs Herman that the camera will record and monitor everything he does for research purposes and there is no way to turn it off during this time. Herman is also told that he may experience some \\"glitches\\" because the implant is still in its experimental stage. As he leaves the clinic, Herman notices a young red-haired girl staring at him intently. Returning home, Herman passes time by playing video games and eventually gets up for tea. He returns from the kitchen to find his game controller far from where he originally left it, followed by the tea kettle crashing to the ground suddenly. Later, Herman sees what appears to be somebody lying beneath the sheets of his bed, but when he pulls back the sheets, the bed is empty. Herman then finds himself face to face with a bleeding man who appears to be dead, causing him to flee to the bathroom. After phoning his doctor to complain about what happened, Herman emerges from the bathroom and encounters the man again, this time with a young girl who also appears to be dead. Returning to the bathroom, Herman is disturbed by repeated banging on the door and ends up sleeping in the bathtub overnight. The next morning, Herman emerges from the bathroom again and everything seems to be normal, albeit his room is in more disarray than the night before. Later, the red-haired girl from the hospital appears at his door and requests to be let in as she too is experiencing a similar situation. Giving her name as Clarissa, she explains that she was born deaf and had a cochlear implant installed in her ear, giving her the ability to hear dead people. Herman suggests to remove the implant to make the ghosts go away, but Clarissa says that doing so will only keep Herman from seeing the ghosts. As Clarissa claims that the ghosts will get stronger and more dangerous the longer one pays attention to them, an overweight underwear-clad man appears behind her. Herman alerts her to his presence, but Clarissa says she knows he is there and that he is her uncle, who wasn't a very nice person. Clarissa then initiates sex as a distraction to make the ghosts leave them alone. Sometime later, Herman awakens and sees Clarissa sleeping on the couch. He finds the young girl in his bed and flees, before witnessing Clarissa being dragged into the pool by an unseen entity. Despite Herman's best efforts to save her, Clarissa drowns. Running back through the house in an attempt to escape the ghosts, Herman once again locks himself in the bathroom and uses a straight razor to cut out the implant. The ghosts of Clarissa and her uncle appear in the bathroom as Herman tries to escape it, but he unwittingly runs directly into the ghosts of the man and young girl, with the former throttling him. The man grabs the implant and shoves it deep into Herman's throat, presumably killing him. =A Ride in the Park= : Directed by Eduardo S√°nchez and Gregg Hale A cyclist, Mike, with a camera affixed on his helmet, is riding through a state park, when he runs into a hysterical and bloody woman, asking for help with her boyfriend. Mike then sees several zombies approaching them, before he is suddenly attacked and bitten on the throat by the woman, whom he kills. Mike staggers through the park, heavily bleeding, before finally collapsing and apparently dying. A pair of bikers come across him and attempt to help, but he reanimates, attacks, and partially devours them. Hearing noise in the distance, the three zombies head off towards it. The trio invades a young girl's birthday party, killing several people, some of whom reanimate to attack others. While trying to attack a man and his three daughters in their car, Mike notices his bloodied reflection, which seems to subdue his aggressive behavior. When he accidentally pocket dials his girlfriend, Amy, he is shocked back to a semi- conscious state upon hearing her voice and kills himself with a discarded shotgun. =Safe Haven= : Directed by Timo Tjahjanto and Gareth Huw Evans A news crew composed of 4 members (Malik the interviewer, his girlfriend Lena, and Adam and Joni the cameramen) infiltrate an Indonesian cult in the hope of shooting a documentary about their mysterious activities. Inside the building, they find the walls adorned in bizarre symbols, schoolchildren in classrooms, and women dressed in white garments. Malik overhears that his fianc√©e, Lena, is pregnant with Adam's child. In the basement, Adam finds a bloody woman strapped to a chair who begins convulsing, causing him to run away. While the cult leader is being interviewed, a bell chimes, and he suddenly announces the \\"time of reckoning\\" over the intercom. The cultists begin a mass suicide via poison and gunshots, while Joni has his throat cut by the cult leader after repeatedly interrupting the announcement. Lena is abducted by several women in surgical apparel, and Malik is shot dead by one of the cult members. As Adam attempts to rescue Lena, an explosion knocks him down, he stands and attempts to advance into the fiery room only to be intercepted by the cult leader, covered in blood with the cult's symbol written on it, who then proceeds to explode into a cloud of blood and organs. Adam finds Lena placed on an altar but is unable to save her as a horned demon (which resembles The Baphomet) tears its way out of her body. As Adam attempts to flee, he is attacked by the previously deceased cultists and schoolchildren, including Joni and Malik, who have all turned into zombie-like ghouls. As he finally manages to get outside and get into the car, he drives off, only to be rammed by the demon and seriously injured. As he crawls out of the car, the demon looks down on Adam before calling him \\"Papa\\". The revelation that the demon is, in fact, his child drives Adam hysterically insane and he starts laughing. Shortly thereafter, the camera malfunctions. =Slumber Party Alien Abduction= : Directed by Jason Eisener Young brothers Gary and Randy attach a camera to their Yorkshire Terrier dog, Tank, to create videos at their lakeside house. After their parents leave, Gary and Randy invite over their friends, Shawn and Danny, and the group harasses the older sister, Jen, and her boyfriend, Zack. While the group is swimming at a nearby lake, they fail to notice a grey alien hiding beneath the water. Later that night, the aliens begin frightening the kids with bright lights and deafening noises. Realizing the aliens are in the house and have cut the power, Zack attempts to scare off the intruders with a shotgun, only to be quickly grabbed by one of the aliens. The aliens attack the rest of the teenagers in the house, dragging them in their sleeping bags, and attempting to drown them in the lake. Only Gary, Randy, Jen and Tank escape, running into the woods to hide. After Tank inadvertently alerts the aliens to their location by barking, the group run toward what they believe to be police lights and sirens, but it turns out to be a trap set by the aliens who abduct Randy. Jen and Gary flee to a nearby barn, where the aliens drag Jen away as Gary and Tank escape up a ladder. As the aliens close in on Gary, he is suddenly pulled into the air by the alien ship's tractor beam. As Gary is pulled into the air, his grip loosens on Tank's leash, and Tank falls down the ladder to the floor, the impact loosening the camera from his back. Mortally injured by the fall, Tank whimpers as he and the camera both slowly die. Cast =Tape 49= * Lawrence Michael Levine as Larry * Kelsy Abbott as Ayesha * L.C.

The film was released via VOD on June 6, and theatrically on July 12. Dance punk band The Death Set recorded a song, \\"6 Different Ways To Die\\", for the film's credits. Reception According to Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based on 64 reviews. The consensus is: \\"It's as scattershot as its predecessor, but V/H/S/2 rounds up enough horror filmmaking talent to deliver a satisfyingly nasty ‚Äì albeit uneven ‚Äì dose of gore.\\" Metacritic rated it 49/100. Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"The scares are as hit- or-miss as the filmmaking\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety called it \\"rip-roaring good time for genre fans\\". On July 10, 2013, Rex Reed was the subject of controversy due to a scathing review of the film in which he admitted having walked out at the end of the first segment. His review does complain about parts of the film that happened after he left the film, but his references are rather imprecise, e.g. describing segment Slumber Party Alien Abduction as \\"a sleepover invaded by psycho kidnappers [as opposed to aliens] told from the perspective of a GoPro camera attached to the back of a dog\\" or summarizing segment A Ride in the Park as the tale of \\"a mountain biker pursued by flesh- eating zombies [rather than turned into one himself early on]\\". Sequel A third film in the series, titled V/H/S: Viral, was released in the US on November 21, 2014.

Dabson was the rare combination of Breeder / Owner / Trainer, and Nance's Lad won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, Swift Stakes and Peter Pan Stakes.

He was a justice of the Tennessee Superior Court of Law and Equity (1807) and the Tennessee Court of Errors and Appeals (1819-1822), both of which were predecessors of the Tennessee Supreme Court, and served as the first Mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee (1816-1817). In his later years, he moved to Jonesborough, where he published an influential newsletter, The Washington Republican and Farmer's Journal.Henry Francis Beaumont, \\"Biography of Thomas Emmerson,\\" American Historical Magazine and Tennessee Historical Society Quarterly, Volume 9 (1904), pp. 141-144. Early life and legal career Emmerson was born in Lawrenceville, Virginia, the eldest child of Arthur Emmerson, an Episcopal clergyman, and Anne (Tazewell) Emmerson.Doris Cline Ward, Charles D. Biddix, The Heritage of Old Buncombe County, Vol. 1 (Old Buncombe County Genealogical Society, 1981), p. 200. He was educated at William & Mary College before moving to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1800. In 1807, he was appointed by Governor John Sevier to the Tennessee Superior Court of Law and Equity, at the time the state's highest court, but resigned later that year. In 1807, Emmerson was appointed to the Board of Trustees of East Tennessee College (the forerunner of the modern University of Tennessee), and served as the Board's secretary from 1812 to 1820. In 1811, he was appointed to the inaugural Board of Trustees of the Knoxville Female Academy. That same year, he was appointed to a commission charged with establishing the Bank of Knoxville, and later became the bank's director. Knoxville incorporated as a city on October 27, 1815. To govern the city, the charter called for the election of a Board of Aldermen, who would then choose from one of their own the city's mayor (the law was changed in 1839 to allow popular mayoral elections). Emmerson was elected to the city's inaugural Board of Aldermen, and was elevated to mayor by his fellow aldermen on January 13, 1816. The Emmerson-led Board established tax rates, created licenses for merchants and bars, appointed tax assessors, and arranged for the construction of a market house on Main Street (later moved to Market Square).John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010), pp. 94, 493. Following his resignation from the court in 1807, Emmerson formed a law partnership with Pleasant M. Miller. In 1818, Emmerson and Judge John Overton published a two-volume collection of state supreme court decisions entitled, Tennessee Reports.Theodore Brown, Jr., A History of the Tennessee Supreme Court (University of Tennessee Press, 2002), p. 16. In 1819, Governor Joseph McMinn appointed Emmerson to the Tennessee Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals, which had succeeded the Court of Law and Equity as the state's highest court. Emmerson served on this court until 1822. Publishing career Following his retirement from the court, Emmerson moved to Jonesborough, Tennessee, where he practiced law and purchased a farm just outside the city on Cherokee Creek.Paul Fink, Jonesborough: The First Century of Tennessee's First Town (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 2002), pp. 139-145. He quickly developed a fascination with experimental farming practices, and helped introduce the first cast iron plow to the region in 1825. In the early 1830s, Emmerson was president of the American Colonization Society's Washington County chapter.The African Repository, Vol. 6 (1831), p. 181. In 1833, Emmerson purchased The Farmer's Journal, a newspaper that had been established in 1825 by Jonesborough printer Jacob Howard (Howard is perhaps better known for printing two abolitionist newspapers, The Emancipator and the Manumission Intelligencer). Emmerson renamed the paper, The Washington Republican and Farmer's Journal, which he initially published in partnership with Seth W.J. Lucky and Lawson Gifford. With the motto, \\"Truth our guide, the public good our aim,\\" the paper supported railroad construction and internal improvements, and was politically anti-Jackson. Within a few months, Lucky left the partnership, and Gifford left in 1835 to establish the Tennessee Sentinel. In December 1834, Emmerson launched a 16-page monthly newsletter entitled, The Tennessee Farmer. In the paper's prospectus, Emmerson states its purpose as \\"the diffusion of agricultural information,\\" with a smaller portion devoted to news regarding internal improvements and other issues of interest to farmers, and short articles seeking to \\"improve the morals of the rising generation.\\"Thomas Emmerson, \\"Prospectus of the Tennessee Farmer,\\" Tennessee Farmer, Vol. 1, No. 1 (December 1834), p. 16. In early 1837, Emmerson sold the Washington Republican to Jonesborough publisher Mason R. Lyon. He died on July 22 of that year, and was buried in Jonesborough's Old Cemetery. Family and legacy Emmerson married Rachel Burwell in 1795, and they had six children. In 1833, after his first wife's death, he married Catherine Jacobs. Following his death, his second wife ran a subscription-based school in Jonesborough for several years. The couple's house still stands on Woodlow Avenue in Jonesborough, and is part of the Jonesborough Historic District.Carolyn Sakowski, Touring the East Tennessee Backroads (John F. Blair, Publisher, 2007), pp. 92-97. Governor William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow (1805-1877) began his journalism career by publishing several anonymous articles in Emmerson's Washington Republican. Impressed, Emmerson encouraged Brownlow to enter the newspaper field. In 1839, Brownlow launched the Whig, which would become one of the most influential newspapers in Tennessee, and would bring Brownlow national fame and notoriety. For several years, Brownlow published the paper in partnership with Emmerson's successor, Mason R. Lyon. In the 1840s, Brownlow frequently clashed with Landon Carter Haynes, editor of the Tennessee Sentinel, the paper that had been founded by Emmerson's associate, Lawson Gifford.

The work was commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony. It was first performed by the San Francisco Symphony under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall on April 30, 2003. Composition =Background= John Adams composed My Father Knew Charles Ives in 2003 as a musical autobiography and as a homage to the early 20th- century American composer Charles Ives, who has been one of Adams's major musical influences. Adams's father Carl Adams did not actually know Charles Ives, but the composer observed many similarities between the two men's lives, and between their lives and his own. In the score program notes, Adams wrote: He continued: The title, Adams observed, may have been unconsciously influenced by Morton Feldman's 1971 chamber piece I Met Heine on the Rue F√ºrstenberg. The music also contains quotes from \\"Reveille\\" and the hymn \\"Nearer, My God, to Thee\\" in addition to many stylistic references to the music of Ives. =Structure= The piece has a duration of approximately 28 minutes and is cast in three movements: The three movements reflect meaningful places in Adams's life. The first movement is a reference to Concord, New Hampshire of Adams's early life, though it doubles as a nod to Concord, Massachusetts of Ives's titular Concord Sonata. \\"The Mountain\\" refers to Mount Kearsarge, Mount Shasta, and the Sierra Nevada mountains of the West Coast. \\"The Lake\\" refers to the waters near Mount Washington where Adams's parents first met. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for an orchestra consisting of the following instruments. ;Woodwinds :piccolo :3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo) :3 oboes : English horn :3 clarinets (3rd doubling E clarinet) : bass clarinet :2 bassoons : contrabassoon ;Brass :4 horns :4 trumpets :3 trombones : tuba ;Percussion :timpani :4 percussionists :piano ;Strings :harp :violin I :violin II :viola :cello :double basses Reception My Father Knew Charles Ives has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"My Father Knew Charles Ives, a funny, rueful and heartbreakingly beautiful musical memoir, melds Adams' personal history with that of American concert music in one easy and daring artistic stroke...\\" He added, \\"This is a capacious and detailed 30-minute orchestral essay by our nation's most important composer working at the height of his creative powers.\\" Kosman later wrote, \\"What an amazing tour de force it is! Full of exuberant humor and tender reverie, written with an unparalleled mastery of orchestral texture and instrumental color, it solidifies Adams' claim as the most important American composer of his generation.\\" Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times similarly described it as a \\"deeply affectionate new score,\\" but also noted, \\"My Father Knew Charles Ives makes an effort to retain that optimism, and it seems that the only way Adams can now do this is through nostalgia, for his childhood, his musical heritage, his own earlier work. The result is still oddly melancholic. Diverting as it is, the new work, in its referrals to Ives, seems to suggest that there is less optimism to be found in what we are today than in what we once were.\\" The music was also lauded by Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times, who remarked, \\"Though at times the score seemed structurally amorphous, moment to moment the music was riveting.\\" Reviewing a recording of the piece, Philip Clark of Gramophone was somewhat more critical, observing, \\"It's difficult to say what exactly Adams has created. It falls somewhere between direct quotation and constructivist allusion, like hearing deconstructed 'picture postcard' Ives. It's fun for sure, and the BBC Symphony Orchestra relishes its follies.\\" Andrew Clements of The Guardian similarly described the triptych as \\"wonderfully crafted, if sometimes coming close to pastiche.\\" Recording A recording of My Father Knew Charles Ives, performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Adams, was released through Nonesuch Records on September 26, 2006. The album also features Adams's electric violin concerto The Dharma at Big Sur.

It was included in the 2008 omnibus Miles in Love. It won the Minnesota Book Award (1999). Plot summary In his new role as Imperial Auditor, Miles Vorkosigan finds himself on Komarr, a planet where his father has an unfortunate reputation, being blamed for a massacre of government officials who had surrendered to him during the planet's conquest. He is there, along with Professor Vorthys, an older, more experienced Auditor and engineer, to investigate whether the destruction of a solar power satellite vital to the ongoing terraforming of the planet was an accident or sabotage. Miles uncovers an extremely dangerous Komarran conspiracy, one which threatens the entire Barrayaran Empire, and is attracted to Vorthys's niece, Ekaterin Vorsoisson, the unhappy wife of an Etienne \\"Tien\\" Vorsoisson, the head of one of the terraforming facilities. Tien suffers from a degenerative genetic condition, which would stigmatize him with other Barrayarans, and has tried to raise money for secret treatment by gambling on the Komarran financial markets. Heavily in debt, he has been bribed by his subordinates to ignore certain irregularities, which he believes are just a swindle, but are actually part of their plot against Barrayar. Tien Vorsoisson dies accidentally, partly due to his own carelessness, after the conspirators capture him and Miles. They are left shackled and exposed to the Komarran atmosphere with only their breathing masks to sustain them, but Tien has neglected to recharge his mask's reserve. Ekaterin finds her husband dead and Miles injured from his efforts to escape. She had been about to leave the marriage, having discovered Tien's gambling losses, but received a mysterious call to pick up Miles and Tien at the remote facility. Miles starts an in- depth investigation of the terraforming facility and its staff, using Barrayar's Imperial Security officers stationed on Komarr. Having been partly responsible for Tien's death, he tries to repay the blood debt by securing treatment for Ekaterin's young son, Nikolai, who inherited the condition. He and Vorthys recruit Komarran physicists to examine the advanced equipment the plotters seem to have purchased, and determine what they intended to do with it. In traditional Barrayaran mourning, Ekaterin leaves Komarr to travel to one of the orbiting stations where she will meet Vorthys's wife, the \\"Professora\\", who is a brilliant academic in her own right and Ekaterin's favorite relative. She and Ekaterin accidentally encounter one of the conspirators who have gone to the station to complete their plot. They are taken prisoner. Their captors explain that they are not terrorists, but have a way to cut off Barrayar from the rest of the settled systems. They do not know that their early experiments were the cause of the destruction of the solar satellite. Miles, having guessed the nature of the plot, realizes the station is in peril and hurries there to stop the plotters and save Ekaterin and the Professora. By the time he arrives, Barrayaran Security has the plotters under siege with Ekaterin and the Professora as hostages. After calming the situation and persuading the plotters to surrender to him, he is surprised and utterly delighted to discover that Ekaterin has a previously hidden talent for inflicting mayhem on her enemies and has already dealt the plot a fatal blow. In the coda Miles bids farewell to the two women before returning to Barrayar to report to Emperor Gregor. His slightly odd behavior does not go unnoticed and he and Ekaterin, bantering about his previous relationships with women, catch each other off-guard. Each is left with questions about the other. Their relationship develops in the next novel, A Civil Campaign. In a departure from the style of previous Vorkosigan books, the point of view is split between Miles and Ekaterin, offering an outside view on Miles.Silvia Kelso (1998)Loud Achievements: Lois McMaster Bujold's Science Fiction Reception Komarr has had a positive reception from reviewers.

He was president of the Writers' Association of South Africa, which later became the Black Media Workers Association of South Africa (or Mwasa), and he led a year-long strike in 1980 for fair wages for black journalists. He was a victim of the Apartheid-era government in South Africa and was imprisoned at least three times for his journalism. After Apartheid ended, he became the chief executive officer of the South African Broadcast Corporation. Personal history Zwelakhe Sisulu's family is well known for its struggle against Apartheid in South Africa. He was the son of anti-Apartheid activists and African National Congress members Walter Sisulu and Albertina Sisulu. He was the brother of Max Sisulu, Speaker of the National Assembly, and Lindiwe Sisulu, Minister of Public Service and Administration. His father was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 when Zwelakhe Sisulu was 13 years old. Sisulu and his wife Zodwa had 2 sons and 1 daughter. Career Zwelakhe Sisulu began his career in journalism in 1975 when he worked as an intern for South African Associated Newspapers. He then became a journalist for The Rand Daily Mail where he covered the Soweto uprising in 1976 and remained there until 1978. He was news editor of the Sunday Post (South Africa) until his ban in 1980. While at the Sunday Post, he was sentenced to prison for his refusal to reveal information about sources of one of his reporters and he led a 1980 strike which resulted in his ban from journalism for several years. After his house arrest, he was a Nieman Fellow. After his fellowship was complete in 1985, he worked for Sowetan. In 1986, he founded the New Nation (defunct since 30 May 1997), before he was arrested by police and held without a trial as part of the emergency and mass arrests in South Africa at the time. The newspaper was editorially aligned with the African National Congress, which stated on its masthead: \\"The media of the powerless.\\" At the time it was South Africa's largest black newspaper. After his release from a 2-year detention and after the ban was lifted on the ANC, Sisulu served as Nelson Mandela's press secretary and also the director of information of the African National Congress. In post-Apartheid South Africa, Sisulu became the head of the South African Broadcast Corporation in 1994. After his stint at SABC, Sisulu founded New African Investments Limited, which is known as the first black-owned business on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black empowerment. Holdings of the company include the publishing house David Philip, Soweto TV and Primedia Broadcasting. Early activism Zwelakhe Sisulu walked a fine line between journalism and activism already while at The Rand Daily Mail. In 1977, he became president of the Writers' Association of South Africa. As president, he led a march with his fellow black journalists and then was briefly jailed. Sisulu's editor admonished him for his explanation that he was making use of his freedom of assembly. His editor told him, \\"You don't march, you write.\\" Sisulu first came to international attention in a case involving the surveillance of black journalists. While an editor at the Sunday Post in 1979, Sisulu was questioned by authorities about his knowledge of a source used by journalist Thamsanqa Gerald Mkhwanazi. Sisulu was sentenced for nine months in prison for refusing to co-operate. For the first time, police acknowledged in his case the practice of using wiretaps on journalists' telephones, which had been widely suspected. Strike and arrest Zwelakhe Sisulu was the leader of the union during Mwasa's strike for fair wages for black journalists in 1980. It was the first strike by black journalists. After the strike was over, he lost his job, was banned from journalism, and ordered under house arrest for three years until 1983. Zwelakhe Sisulu's arrest on 30 June 1981 was attributed to the Internal Security Act. Other leaders who shared the same fate were Phil Mtimkhulu, Mathatha Tsedu, Subri Govende and Joe Thloloe. He was a Nieman Fellow from 1984‚Äì1985. New Nation and 1986 arrests Zwelakhe Sisulu was arrested twice in 1986. Police swept him away from his home for the first time on 27 June 1986. Sisulu later called them \\"armed bandits.\\" The government announced his detention one week later. There were calls from abroad to release him, such as one from the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE). He was released on 18 July 1986. Zwelakhe Sisulu had already been appointed director of the Board for a new organisation ARTICLE 19 at the time of his second arrest 12 December 1986. He was detained at John Vorster Square where other activists were also imprisoned. The organization made his case its first campaign. He was released after two years but not allowed to continue his work as a journalist. Years later, he stated his belief that the publicity of organisations like ARTICLE 19 during the time of his imprisonment saved his life. South African Broadcasting Corporation He was the CEO of the South African Broadcasting Corporation from September 1994 to 1997. Under Sisulu's leadership in a democratic South Africa, the SABC was reorganized and relaunched 4 February 1996. A controversy was created over the redistribution of resources for other languages besides Afrikaans, which had received special privileges under the Apartheid system. Later, Sisulu was appointed as a commissioner to investigate censorship at the SABC that had been alleged by whistleblower John Perlman. Awards Sisulu was awarded an Order of Mapungubwe - Gold, posthumously for \\"his exceptional contribution to quality journalism; and as a reporter exposing the cruelties of apartheid and encouraging unity among the people of different political persuasions to fight for liberation.\\") See also * History of the African National Congress * Media of South Africa  References   External links  * In Memory of Zwelakhe Sisulu Category:1950 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Anti- apartheid activists Category:Free speech activists Category:Nieman Fellows Category:People from Johannesburg Category:Public relations people Category:South African activists Category:South African businesspeople Category:South African journalists Category:South African prisoners and detainees Category:Xhosa people ","title":"Zwelakhe Sisulu"},{"id":"38358028","text":"Raj Kumar Aggarwal (born 1949) is an Anglo-Indian pharmacist, public health expert, businessman and the first ever Honorary Consul for India with jurisdiction for Wales.Llewellyn-Jones, Robert. \\"Raj Aggarwal appointed first ever honorary consul for India in Wales\\" South Wales Echo. 27 September 2012.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team. The channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding Fox Sports West as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region. Until April 2020 when AT&T;, owner of DirecTV, came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market. Disputes in negotiations included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an \\"a la carte\\" basis. History In late 2012, Fox Sports' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended. Reports published at that time indicated that the team was negotiating with other potential broadcasters, such as the recently established Time Warner Cable SportsNet, and contemplating forming an in-house network with Dick Clark Productions, a television production company recently purchased by the Dodgers' new parent company, Guggenheim Partners. On January 22, 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported that Time Warner Cable had signed a deal to partner with the Dodgers to form a new regional sports network, which would be majority-owned by the team. On January 28, the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable signed a 25-year broadcast agreement valued at $8.35 billion, subject to the approval of Major League Baseball, which would see the establishment of a new channel known as SportsNet LA. The deal ended long-standing broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West, which had aired Dodgers games on its Prime Ticket channel since 1997; and with KCAL-TV, an independent station which had been the Dodgers' over-the-air broadcast television outlet since 2006. TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from Prime Ticket and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by Prime Ticket in 2013. Following the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of spring training, and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in Spanish; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future. While the channel is not directly branded with the Dodgers' name, its logo incorporates the team's interlocking \\"LA\\" insignia; team co-owner Todd Boehly stated that the decision was \\"something [Time Warner Cable] thought was really valuable to their brand. We have the flexibility to sit down and evolve the name over time.\\" Programming Team president Stan Kasten described Sportsnet LA as a \\"Dodger-only channel with Dodger-only content 24/7\\", featuring live game coverage and original series focusing on aspects of the team. The initial program lineup included: *Access SportsNet: Dodgers ‚Äî the channel's flagship news and information program, airing nightly and as a pre- and post-game show. *Leadoff LA ‚Äî analysis of the team by Sportsnet LA personalities and experts, batting practice coverage, and viewer interaction through social media. *Dodgers Clubhouse ‚Äî airs weekly during the season with in-depth features on the team and its players, and interviews with the team's manager. *Backstage: Dodgers ‚Äî airs weekly during the season, featuring a behind-the-scenes perspective on the Dodgers' games, players, and staff. *Talkin' Blue ‚Äî panel discussions featuring Dodgers' players and staff. * Connected With... ‚Äî profiles and interviews of Dodgers players and staff, and documentaries. *Timeless Dodgers ‚Äî classic Dodgers games. *Larry King at Bat ‚Äî an interview program hosted by long-time television personality and avid Dodgers fan Larry King *Dodgers Squeeze Play ‚Äî condensed one-hour encores of Dodgers games.http://www.sportsnetla.com/tv-schedule As part of cutbacks across TWC's Los Angeles regional sports networks due to low viewership, Larry King at Bat and Dodgers Clubhouse were cancelled in September 2015. The following February, the channel announced it would reduce the number of spring training games it broadcasts to 16, down from 31 in 2015 and 22 in its debut year. Talent Long-time sportscaster Vin Scully continued his tenure as voice of the Dodgers on SportsNet LA until his 2016 retirement. *Joe Davis (lead play-by-play) *Orel Hershiser (color commentary) *Nomar Garciaparra (color commentary) *Tim Neverett (alternate play-by-play) *Alanna Rizzo (field reporter on gameday, also hosts studio shows) *Jerry Hairston, Jr. (studio commentary) *Ned Colletti (studio commentary) *John Hartung (studio host of Access Sportsnet: Dodgers) As of the 2017 season, Dodgers games on SportsNet LA are called by Joe Davis on play-by-play, and Orel Hershiser on color. Alanna Rizzo, formerly of MLB Network, is a field reporter and hosts the pre- and post-game show from Dodger Stadium. Former baseball players Nomar Garciaparra and Jerry Hairston, Jr., and former Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti are also part of the pre- and post-game broadcasts. Former KABC-TV anchor John Hartung serves as a studio host. From SportsNet LA's inaugural season through 2016, Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully retained his traditional role as solo commentator for Dodgers games in California and Arizona. The 2014 MLB season marked his 65th as a baseball commentator. Games not called by Scully were called by Charley Steiner (play-by-play) and Orel Hershiser (color commentary). Scully retired at the conclusion of the 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season. The following season, he was succeeded by Joe Davis; he was phased into the role by performing play-by-play for 52 road games during the 2016 season, splitting with Steiner the games not being called by Scully that season. Steiner continues to serve as an alternate play-by-play announcer if Davis is unable to work a game due to a Fox Sports assignment. For the 2014 season, SportsNet LA began to carry an expanded schedule of dedicated Spanish-language broadcasts of Dodgers games on a special feed of the network. For the 2014 season, 75 games were broadcast in Spanish, and called by Jorge Jarr√≠n (son of the team's long-time Spanish radio voice Jaime Jarrin) and Manny Mota. As of the 2015 season, all Dodgers games broadcast by SportsNet LA are available in Spanish; at this time, Jorge moved to the Spanish-language radio broadcasts with his father, while Pepe Yniguez and Fernando Valenzuela moved from radio to television alongside Mota. Also in 2014, SportsNet LA launched Korean-language broadcasts carried on SAP, called by Richard Choi and Chong Ho Yim. The Dodgers were the first MLB team to offer a Korean-language broadcast for all of its games.  Carriage  Until April 2020 when AT&T; agreed to carry the network, SportsNet LA had never been available to the majority of households in its service area. Carriage was most limited in the channel's inaugural 2014 season, when it was carried by Time Warner Cable systems in Los Angeles, Bright House Networks' system in Bakersfield, and Champion Broadband serving a small portion of the San Gabriel Valley. Together, these distributors covered only 30% of the market, leaving the remaining 70% without the channel. Coverage rose when Charter Communications added SportsNet LA in June 2015, but remained under 50 percent: about 1.8 million homes. DirecTV, later owned by AT&T;, was the largest unsigned distributor. Charter acquired TWC in May 2016. On April 1, 2020, AT&T; came to terms with Charter after a seven-year impasse (sufficiently long that some fans on social media believed the announcement was an April Fool's prank), reaching a multi-year deal to carry SportsNet LA on its video platforms, including AT&T; TV/AT&T; TV Now, DirecTV and U-Verse. The agreement brought the number of households able to view SportsNet LA to about 3 million. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis, DirecTV had been \\"hemorrhaging customers\\" and viewed sports as one of the few remaining reasons for customers to pay at least $100 a month for a conventional pay-TV subscription. \\"Without sports, millions of additional consumers probably would cut the pay-TV cord\\". For Charter, the deal helped stem annual losses of about $150 million on the SportsNet LA contract. The channel remains in an impasse with other Southern California providers, including DISH and Cox Communications. = Factors = The carriage dispute is emblematic of the growing tension between high-fee sports channels and content distributors. The latter have grown concerned over losing subscribers who resent paying for sports channels they don't watch. Early on, DirecTV offered to carry the channel on an \\"a la carte\\" basis, rather than part of a package, at whatever monthly fee TWC set. That scheme would have avoided passing the cost to DirecTV's entire base of subscribers, including those not interested in the channel. TWC responded by noting that bundled regional sports channels have been an industry standard, one that DirecTV itself adheres to in other markets. Another factor, one specific to Los Angeles, was the large number of regional sports channels in the area, which has resulted in higher subscriber costs than in other metropolitan regions. Those channels include Spectrum SportsNet (formerly Time Warner Cable SportsNet), whose ratings dropped along with the flagging performance of its most visible team, the Los Angeles Lakers. In addition, some industry observers believed that Comcast, which was trying to acquire Time Warner Cable, would write off losses on the Dodgers' contract and offer distributors a better deal. That speculation lowered the signing incentive in 2014. Comcast withdrew the acquisition proposal on April 24, 2015. In turn, Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable on May 26, 2015. As a result, Charter added SportsNet LA on June 9, making the network available to nearly 300,000 additional subscribers in the Los Angeles region. = Proposed distribution fees = In 2014, Time Warner Cable reportedly asked other distributors for an estimated $4.90 monthly fee per household, with carriage fees increasing over the length of the contract. In March 2016, TWC attempted to break the stalemate by reducing the fee for the upcoming season by about 30 percent: about $3.50 per household, according to an estimate by the analyst firm SNL Kagan. A follow-up offer extended the period to six years, with fees comparable to DirecTV's own Seattle-based regional sports channel, Root Sports Northwest, estimated at $3.84 per household. Both pre-season offers were rejected before opening day. In September 2016, after acquiring TWC, Charter indicated it would price the 2017 season above $4.50. ‚Äú[The previous] deal is no longer on the table‚Äîit didn't work,‚Äù said Charter Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge to the Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúWe would love to sell the channel to others, but no one has bought it‚Äîand we are not giving it away. So if consumers want the Dodger channel, they'll need to subscribe to us to get it.‚Äù = Consequences = Some industry observers saw TWC's inability to resell the channel as having industry-wide consequences. Midway through the channel's 2014 inaugural season, Los Angeles Times business reporter Joe Flint called the standoff a potentially \\"definitive moment for the world of sports programming, as the industry realizes that exorbitantly priced television deals can backfire.\\" Four years later, Kagen sports analyst Adam Gajo said that the carriage dispute challenged the assumption that subscribers would absorb almost any cost to see their teams play. He called SportsNet LA a \\"turning point‚Äù for teams, forcing them to consider whether higher revenues from distributors might sacrifice the next generation of fans. In its first two baseball seasons, Time Warner Cable lost more than $100 million a year on SportsNet LA due to the channel's limited distribution. TWC Sports President David B. Rone, who was instrumental in the company's foray into regional sports programming, departed TWC in October 2015. By June 2017, the SportsNet LA viewership for Dodger games had dropped 49% from 2013, shifting from 154,000 households to 79,000. Television viewership for the Dodgers' regional rivals, the Los Angeles Angels, initially soared to 107,000 households per game in 2014. But that number dropped over the 2015 and 2016 seasons, averaging just 47,000 households in the first few months of the 2017 season, even though the games are broadcast on all major carriers. In a bid to increase viewership, SportsNet LA began to syndicate selected Dodgers games to broadcast television stations. In 2014 and 2016, the Dodgers' final six regular season games were shown on KDOC-TV and KTLA. The latter season included Vin Scully's final games before his retirement. In 2017, 10 early- season games aired on KTLA, which, together with SportsNet LA, drew an average 378,000 viewers per game, about five times the size of the usual audience. The station broadcast five early-season games in 2018 and has scheduled ten for 2019. = DirecTV collusion lawsuit = On November 2, 2016, the United States Department of Justice sued DirecTV and its corporate successor, AT&T; Inc., alleging the company colluded with its competitors to prevent SportsNet LA from being carried more widely. The parties settled the following March, resulting in stricter operating guidelines for AT&T;, but no break in the negotiating stalemate. The DOJ alleged that DirecTV had \\"unlawfully exchanged competitively-sensitive information\\" with AT&T; (prior to its acquisition of DirecTV), Charter, and Cox Communications surrounding their negotiations and plans to carry SportsNet LA, in order to \\"obtain bargaining leverage and to reduce the risk that they would lose subscribers if they decided not to carry the channel but a competitor chose to do so.\\" AT&T; general counsel David McAtee responded to the claims, stating that the company made its decision \\"independently, legally and only after thorough negotiations with the content owner‚Äù, and argued that no other provider carried the channel because they did not want to pass TWC's \\"inflated prices\\" for the channel on to consumers. The March 2017 settlement required AT&T; to better ensure that its employees maintain confidentiality during contract negotiations. But the state of those negotiations remained unchanged as AT&T; was not required to make any bargaining concessions.

Ayn al-Tineh was historically a fief of the Kheirbek clan, a prominent family in the Syrian security forces and part of the Kalbiyya tribal confederation. According to French researcher Fabrice Balanche, Ayn al-Tineh is one of a number of villages in the coastal mountain region, like al-Tawahin, that is largely dependent on the Syrian Army and the state, finding abundant employment in the former and within the internal security services. The poverty of the village is a significant motivational factor in the high rate of employment in the security forces and the consequent backing of the ruling Assad family. This is in contrast to other impoverished Alawite villages in the region which that have historically been at odds with the prominent Alawite families and have not received the extent of benefits from state income that Ayn al-Tineh does.Balanche, 2006, p. 180. During the middle and end of late President Hafez al-Assad's term in the 1980s and 1990s, a hussainia (Shia Muslim congregational mosque) was founded in Ayn al-Tineh. It was the smallest one built by the al-Murtada movement, measuring 40 square meters. While during Hafez's rule the hussainias served largely for local opposition meetings, this changed when relations between Shia Muslim-majority Iran and Syria increased dramatically with the coming to power of current President Bashar al- Assad.Sindawi, Khalid.

In the interpretation of seismic reflection data, horizons are the reflectors (or seismic events) picked on individual profiles. These reflectors represent a change in rock properties across a boundary between two layers of rock, particularly seismic velocity and density. Marker horizon Marker horizons are stratigraphic units of distinctive lithology (different from the bulk of the sequence) with a wide geographical extent that are used in stratigraphic correlation. Layers of tuff (lithified volcanic ash) are often used for this purpose. Event horizon An event horizon is a bed that marks a geological event, such as an earthquake or a meteorite impact. It is the basic unit used in event stratigraphy. Gorizont The fundamental unit of Russian stratigraphy, the gorizont, can be anglicized as \\"horizon\\". However, this concept is not equivalent to the term used in western geological systems. While the western term \\"horizon\\" pertains to a small lithological section within a geological formation, a gorizont is a broad biostratigraphic unit. It may encompass several \\"svitas\\" (lithological units equivalent to a formation).

She received her BSc (1988) and Ph.D. (1995) from Stanford University. After working as a visiting scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in 1995, she held a postdoctoral position at Princeton University from 1995-1998. She joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1998, and became an Associate in CIFAR's Superconductivity Program (now called the Quantum Materials Program) in 2000. She became an Associate Professor (with tenure) at Stanford in 2002 and is currently a Professor of Applied Physics and of Physics at Stanford. She currently works in the Geballe Laboratory for Advanced Materials (GLAM), and is the Director of the Center for Probing the Nanoscale (CPN), a National Science Foundation-funded center where Stanford and IBM scientists continue to improve scanning probe methods for measuring, imaging, and controlling nanoscale phenomena. She lists her scientific interests and main areas of research and experimentation as: * Single vortex dynamics in classical and high temperature superconductors, * Spontaneous currents and vortex effects in highly correlated electron systems, and * Mesoscopic superconductors and currents in normal metal rings, with an increasing interest in the spin properties of such small structures. Career Early in her career, with John Kirtley from IBM, their research demonstrated that one of the predictions of a popular theory for high- temperature superconductivity was inaccurate by a factor of 10. In 2011 her research group placed two non-magnetic materials (complex oxides) together and discovered an unexpected result: The layer where the two materials meet has both magnetic and superconducting regions. These are two properties that are normally incompatible, since \\"superconducting materials, which conduct electricity with no resistance and 100 percent efficiency, normally expel any magnetic field that comes near them.\\" Exploration of this phenomenon will be aimed toward discovery of whether the properties co-exist uneasily, or this marks the discovery of an exotic new form of superconductivity that actively interacts with magnetism. In May 2018, Professor Moler was named Vice Provost and Dean of Research at Stanford University, effective September 1, 2018.

Population: On three sides of Balagansk is the Bratsk Reservoir. The settlement is best known for Balagansk Prison, which was used as one of the Siberian exile camps during the Stalin era. History Balagansk was founded in 1654 on the left bank of the Angara River opposite to the mouth of the Unga River by the Cossack detachment led by Dmitry Firsov in the course of Russian colonization of Siberia. Its name is derived from the word \\"Bulagat\\", literally meaning sable hunters, a Buryat tribe. From 1655, mass settlement started in the area; eventually, a colony was built and iron mining developed. In 1658, Ivan Pokhabov, the administrator (prikazchik) of Balagansk, caused an outbreak and many Russians were killed by them. Balagansk Fortress (ostrog) was built in Balagansk; the Buryats were attached to it and paid tributes to the Russians. Buryats grew to dominate the area and on April 1, 1818, seventeen clans of the Balagansk Buryats met and adopted a memorandum to submit to the Russian authorities. In their memorandum they raised six issues and also provided action to be taken on each of them which related to courts, private law, criminal law, the rights and duties of the chief Taisha and heads of clans. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included in Siberia Governorate. In 1764, Irkutsk Governorate split off, and in 1775, Balagansk became a town and the seat of Balagansky Uyezd of Irkutsk Governorate. In 1924, the uyezds were abolished, the governorate was split into districts, and Balagansk became a part of Ziminsky District. In 1925, it lost town status and was downgraded to a selo. In 1926, Balagansky District was established, and Balagansk became the district center. In the 19th and the 20th centuries, Balagansk, along with all Siberian towns, was widely used for political exile. Catherine Breshkovsky, known as the Little Grandmother of The Russian Revolution, was sent to Balagansk, a place of her choice on exile, as she expressed that her health would be better protected here. Joseph Stalin, when he tried to escape from exile in 1902, visited Balagansk. Balagansk Prison was used as one of the Siberian exile camps for dissidents, persecuted ethnic groups and criminals, and Stalin sent many Jews to the camp. It was one of the oldest buildings in the city but has long been in a dilapidated state. Bratsk dam and Hydroelectric Power Station which submerged the old town of Balagansk During the construction of Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station, Balagansk had to be evacuated as it was slated to be submerged under water. A new settlement, Novobalagansk (literally, New Balagansk), was founded in 1957 several dozens kilometers north of the original location of Balagansk to house the residents. The name passed to the new settlement, when it was renamed Balagansk and granted urban-type settlement status on June 5, 1962. In the same year, Balagansky District was abolished, and the settlement was transferred to Zalarinsky District, in 1965 to Ust-Udinsky District, and in 1989 Balagansky District was established, and Balagansk became the administrative center of the district. Geography Balagansk is situated on the left bank of the Angara River at the average elevation of . A grotto is located near Balagansk. It is a natural cave or opening whose entrance is formed in a rock face that is in height with a width of about . When viewed from a distance, it appears to be ruins. In the large opening there are three caverns which lead into three large galleries, each of which is about in length. These join at the end to form a larger cavern which extends further for some distance and terminates at a dead end of a huge mass of ice. Climate and vegetation During the Pleistocene period, the climate changes that occurred were severe, which caused changes in distribution patterns of flora and fauna. These changes which occurred between glacial and interglacial periods have been explained under the refugia theory propounded in 1969 by J√ºrgen Haffer. Balagansk, which is part of the eastern forest-steppes of Tulun-Irkutsk- Balagansk, is reported to possess a different type of Arboreal vegetation. These are mainly pine and larch. The area which is forested constitutes a much greater area than cultivated lands. Balagansk has a subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc). Winters are very cold and long while summers are warm and wet. Average monthly temperatures range from in July to in January. Precipitation is moderate and is significantly higher in summer than at other times of the year. Economy =Industry= The economy of Balagansk is based on timber and food industries. south of Balagansk, there is a quarry which supplies clay for brick production. =Transportation= The settlement is connected by road with Zalari, where it has access to the M53 highway, connecting Novosibirsk with Irkutsk. The closest accessible railway station is also in Zalari, which lies on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Angara is navigable. Culture The tomb of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anielewski, a Polish social- democrat who died in 1898, at the old cemetery in Balagansk is protected as a cultural monument of federal significance.

She splits her time between Minnesota and Victoria, British Columbia in Coast Salish territories. She was a Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Peoples in the Indigenous Governance Program at the University of Victoria, and is recognized as a leading Indigenous intellectual. Her research interests include Indigenous women's roles in resisting colonialism, recovering Indigenous knowledge, and truth-telling as part of restorative justice.  Early life  Born February 13, 1968, in Virginia, MN; daughter of Chris Mato Nunpa, Ph.D (a former Associate Professor of Indigenous Nations & Dakota Studies at Southwest Minnesota State University) and Edith Brown Travers (a social service director). Waziyatawin was born Angela Lynn Cavender, and grew up both on and off the Upper Sioux reservation. Both her parents were educators. She married Scott Wilson in 1992. In 2007 she legally changed her name from her married name, Angela Cavender Wilson, to Waziyatawin, a name an elder gave her as a child and which means \\"woman of the north\\".  Education and career  She earned a double major in history and American Indian studies at the University of Minnesota in 1992, then completed masters (1996) and doctoral degrees (2000) in history at Cornell University. Her Ph.D thesis was an oral history project that she later published as Remember This! Dakota Decolonization and the Eli Taylor Narratives. She earned tenure at Arizona State University and taught there until 2007. Wilson edited her first book, Indigenizing the Academy: Transforming Scholarship and Empowering Communities, in 2004 with Devon Abbott Mihesuah. In 2005, Wilson edited For Indigenous Eyes Only: A Decolonization Handbook with Michael Yellow Bird. The book compiles essays from eight indigenous American academics. In 2008, she joined the Indigenous Governance Program at the University of Victoria, saying she was interested in the program's commitment to Indigenous liberation and social action. Waziyatawin is the author or editor of six books about Dakota history, Indigenous resistance, and decolonizing strategies. She founded Oyate Nipi Kte, a non-profit organization dedicated to \\"the recovery of Dakota traditional knowledge, sustainable ways of being, and Dakota liberation.\\"  Activism  As an activist, Waziyatawin gained public attention in 2007 when she was arrested multiple times while protesting the Minnesota sesquicentennial celebration. The protests aimed to raise awareness of broken treaties and colonial violence, including the hanging of 38 Dakota men during the Dakota War of 1862 (the largest mass execution in American history). In 2010, The Winona Post published a letter from a student who had attended a lecture she gave at Winona State University, saying she had incited violence against white people and calling her position \\"terrorism\\". Waziyatawin said she was subsequently contacted by the FBI, but they later closed the case about her. In response she told CBC News, \\"My position is that I don't call for violence outright but my recommendation does not preclude the use of violence for indigenous self-defence ‚Äî the defence of our populations or defence of our land base... Never have I advocated violence against white settlers.\\" In 2011, she travelled to Palestine with a group of Indigenous and women of color scholars and artists including Angela Davis, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, and Ayoka Chenzira. Afterwards the group published a statement endorsing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Waziyatawin has drawn connections between the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and colonialism in North America.

Some vessels, mostly passenger ships, had the same red stripe and red emblem on the white color funnels. The company can trace its history to May 16, 1833 when the Black Sea Society of Steamships (ROPiT) was established as means of permanent communications between Odessa and Istanbul, but the company disappeared after the Crimean War of the 1850s. The company was re-established on June 13, 1922 as Black Sea - Azov Sea Shipping by the Council of Labour and Defence as part of the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes and administrated by the Central Administration of State Merchant Fleet (Gostorgflot). The Black Sea - Azov Sea Shipping company split into Black Sea Shipping Company, Azov Sea Shipping Company and Georgian Shipping Company after World War II. Another split took place in 1964 when a new company, Novorossiysk Shipping Company, was created from the tanker division of the Black Sea Shipping Company. Azov Sea region management of Black Sea Shipping Company was created in Zhdanov in 1953. Azov Sea region management was reorganized in Azov Sea Shipping Company in 1967. It is why some ships of Black Sea Shipping Company ships were handed over changed to Azov Sea Shipping Company and home port was changed from Odessa to Zhdanov. So, two sister ships Nezhin and Smela were transferred to Azov Sea Shipping Company in 1969 or in 1967. In 1990 Black Sea Shipping was the biggest one in Europe among other shipping companies and the second in whole world. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the company was passed from the Ministry of Sea Fleet of the USSR as a state company of Ukraine and later registered with the State Property Fund of Ukraine.

Process capital is one of the three components of structural capital, itself a component of intellectual capital.Edvinsson L, Malone MS (1997) Intellectual capital: realizing your company‚Äôs true value by finding its hidden roots. HarperBusiness, New Yorkhttp://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/vwschow/lectures/ism3620/rp01.pdf Process capital can be seen as the value of processes to any entity, whether for profit or not-for profit, but is most commonly used in reference to for-profit entities. A process comprises a \\"series or network of value-added activities, performed by their relevant roles or collaborators, to purposefully achieve the common business goal.Ryan K. L. Ko (2009). A computer scientist's introductory guide to business process management (BPM), ACM Crossroads 15(4), ACM Press Process capital can be created and enhanced by using business process mapping,Jacka, J. Mike & Paulette J. Keller (2011), Business Process Mapping: Improving Customer Satisfaction business process modeling^ a b Asbj√∏rn Rolstad√•s (1995). \\"Business process modeling and reengineering\\". in: Performance Management: A Business Process Benchmarking Approach and business process management vom Brocke, J.HKVJH & Rosemann, M. (2010), Handbook on Business Process Management: Strategic Alignment, Governance, People and Culture (International Handbooks on Information Systems) (Vol. 1). Berlin: Springer  Roots  = Process Capital in Organisations = Organisations invest in process capital in order to build a company‚Äôs unique infrastructure for achieving operational and strategic goals. Given the dynamics of industry and technology, the development of process capital evolves and interacts with environmental changes. Organisations have invested in information technology (IT) and organisational change programs to build process capital for achieving business excellence through customer satisfaction. The vast investments include: IT infrastructure implementation, quality-improvement projects, process-redesign projects, and various process integration projects. Although process capital plays an important role in organising resources, processing information, interacting with stakeholders, and delivering organisational values, few studies have discussed its specific content, and it is rare to focus attention on the level of its management. Instead, process capital has usually been hidden in the measurement of IT investment or organisational intellectual capital as an intangible element of organisational assets. Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent. = Definition = Capital is something owned which provides ongoing services. In the national accounts, or to firms, capital is made up of durable investment goods, normally summed in units of money. Process capital, in practice, embraces the practical knowledge of operations, techniques, and employee programs in the effort to extend and enhance the efficiency of manufacturing or the delivery of products and services for long-term value. Failure to treat process capital as a separate and unique management issue is widespread among both businesses and researchers because most of the systems and processes within the organisations are interdependent. Therefore, a systematic approach to measuring process capital is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent.  Strategy Development  Process capital is essential for strategy development and implementation. Business processes are large with technology, location and other factors combining to generate limitless possibilities. Throughout the process of developing and appropriating technology-enabled processes, collective brainpower is formalised, captured, and leveraged to produce an asset of higher value and affect organisational performance in all aspects. = Organisational Performance = Organisational performance can include the operational, managerial, and strategic impacts of different business efforts on the management of business processes. However, because organisational performance is influenced by numerous factors, the benefits from process capital can be expected to take up to several years to filter through the various levels of business performance. For example, a process integration technology may take months to develop and transform into real processes and to generate increased productivity. In addition, after processes emerge into business operation, greater managerial and strategic performance may appear later. Therefore, it is important to use proper measures to reflect process value for both the short and long term.  Measuring process capital  = Input Method = The input method is measured by the resources invested in process capital for business operations. In economic terms, this is expected to predict the future value of the processes. The two measurement indicators for this method are investment in information technology and administrative expanses. Firm size and industry type are the two controlled variables that are used in all three methods. = Output Method = The output method is measured by the total effort of managing the technology and operations which achieve business effectiveness. The process indicators measure the actual value of labor productivity, such as profit per employee, to determine the contribution to the firm's overall productivity. This method is based on reviewing past performances to predict future results. = Management Capability = Management capability is the capability of constructing and coordinating resources to integrate and develop processes to respond to changing business conditions. The method measures the value of the process capital at the time of the measurement as a percentage change of the productivity compared to the previous year.  Green Capital  Studies show that process capital has a positive influence on competitive advantages of firms. = Competitive Advantage = Companies engaging in environmental management and green innovation actively can not only minimise production waste and increase productivity, but also charge relatively high prices for green products, improve corporate images, and thereby obtain corporate competitive advantages under the trends of popular environmentalism consciousness of consumers and severe international regulations of environmental protection. Therefore, the stocks of organisational capabilities, organisational commitments, knowledge management systems, reward systems, information technology systems, databases, managerial institution, operation processes, managerial philosophies, organisational culture, company images, patents, copy rights, and trademarks, etc. about environmental protection or green innovation within a company can help companies obtain competitive advantages. = Measuring Green Capital = The measurement of green structural capital comprises the following nine items: (1) whether the management system of environmental protection in the firm is superior to that of its major competitors; (2) whether innovations about environmental protection in the firm are more than those of its major competitors;'' (3) whether the profits earned from environmental protection activities of the firm is Effect of Green Intellectual Capital on Competitive Advantages of Firms 277 more than that of its major competitors; (4) whether the ratio of investments in R&D; expenditures about environmental protection in the firm to its sales is more than that of its major competitors; (5) whether the ratio of employees about environmental management to the total employees in the firm is more than that of its major competitors; (6) whether investments in environmental protection facilities in the firm are more than those of its major competitors; (7) whether the competence in the development of green products in the firm is better than that of its major competitors; (8) whether the overall operation processes about environmental protection in the firm work smoothly; (9) whether the knowledge management system about environmental management in the firm is favorable for the accumulation and sharing of the knowledge of environmental management.  Process Capital and Nursing  Process capital is one of the three components of structural capital. Nursing structural capital is knowledge converted into information structures that nurses can use to assist with their clinical decision-making and care planning. Nursing structural capital in the form of practice guidelines, care maps or protocols is believed to provide relevant information to nurses for improving the quality of care they deliver. Care maps, practice guidelines and protocols have been found to contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduce the rate of adverse events.  Transforming Human Capital to Structural Capital  = Distinguishing between Information Elements = The intellectual capital model distinguishes between three distinct elements: Human Capital, Structural Capital, and Relational Capital. Leadership represents ideas of Human Capital, the intellectual value of the employees in a firm. All intellectual capital first originates as Human Capital. Innovation and process capital represents components of structural capital, elements that show the legal and process value of the company. Innovation capital includes embodied knowledge sets like patents and copyrights. Process capital tends to consist of more intangible elements of a tacit knowledge set which includes process technologies. In other words, structural capital consists of elements with which the firm's members interact to create more knowledge or get the work done. Relational capital is moderated by cultural capital and both of these elements represent the knowledge needed to provide ongoing value-added relations with shareholders. (Figure 1 source. = Key Principle = The key principle illustrated in Figure 1 is that no element of intellectual capital by itself creates ongoing value for the firm but is value creating only when interacting with other elements of the intellectual capital model. Thus, the true nature of the intellectual capital machine within the firm is dynamic and with reference to measurement issues. Measuring one elements may affect the measurement of another and once measurements are made of the element its magnitude and direction of flow may have already changed. Total knowledge of the intellectual capital system through measurement is impossible. = Institutionalisation Issues = A problem that may result from narrowly defining the knowledge stocks to be measured is that of reification and institutionalisation of such stock. Identifying a set of importance may over- emphasise the real strategic value of the set, especially in times of strategical change. When knowledge stocks are identified and attention given to them their importance may be rectified by those within the firm and results in the development of core rigidities, or strategic commitment, which may stagnate potentially revitalising innovation. Leonard-Barton identified knowledge as one of the most difficult to change. When it is past success and attention, it creates core rigidities. The term she uses to demonstrate the basic principle is a \\"way of seeing is also a way of not seeing.\\"  Structuralization assumption  The predominance of a structuralization assumption is that all knowledge needs to be structuralized to be valuable to a firm, leading to reification of knowledge as explicit. This assumption treats all knowledge as easily distinguishable from human experience. = Lynn's anecdote = A woman who had been working in North America for a German company was fired when the firm downsized and moved all its operations back to Germany. Later, the company learned that the woman had been working on strategically important information on the North American market, thus the knowledge this woman had created had been erroneously \\"let go\\" in the process of downsizing. The moral of the story espoused by the author was that the company should have structuralized this knowledge so that it could be owned and retained by the firm even after eliminating the woman from its payroll. Why was the woman fired? Surely, the firm should have been more aware of its developing knowledge sets because knowledge sets are the bases from which all intellectual capital emanates. Furthermore, the strategically relevant information is communicable and could have been codified. = Issues in managing multiple capital = How does the firm manage both its structural capital as product and its human capital as process? If this flip side seems humanistic, it is. The human intellect is the only entity that has the capacity to create new knowledge that has value. Computers may reassemble information into new modes analytically but cannot integrate these into something new. Structuralization of human capital may be only possible and desired when it can be used to further help the development of human capital, as non-contextual data or information, or sold as a product for profit. An important insight is that the firm need not own something outright in order for it to profit from association. An example of such an intangible tacit knowledge set that the firm could hardly structuralize and yet profits by association is seen in the relational capital created between a sales agent and client. The move towards structuralization of tacit, experiential knowledge may result in other problems. Attempts to measure knowledge stock may disrupt the very process involved in creating new knowledge stocks. In such attempts, will we have killed the goose in order to get the golden egg? That is, the very process of measurement may interfere with the process by which knowledge creates value. Thus, firms should also look towards leveraging intellectual capital through \\"organising\\" rather than \\"structuralizaing\\" their knowledge assets: organising attempts to coordinate the intellectual capital elements such that their interaction increases ongoing value of the firm as a \\" going concern\\" rather than simply as an asset on a balance sheet. Another problem here may be called the \\"false recipe\\" syndrome where the metaphor is that of the chef who, unconsciously or otherwise, neglects to communicate subtle but important elements of a recipe. Managers often lose the support of labor in initiating productivity improvement exercise because, rightly or wrongly, they are perceived as designed to put workers out of a job.  Product and process  In managing intellectual capital there are at least two distinct things that are being managed. Figure 2 illustrates these two streams flowing from the development of human capital. (Figure 2 source.) = Stock = The first is the knowledge stock itself. The most successful examples of managing intellectual capital from the literature are indicative of this type. Because this type represents the structural capital of the \\"structuralization\\" assumption, this is not surprising. It is, however, important. Usually these consist of the products of the intellectual capital development process. = Work = The second thing being managed is the knowledge work itself. This is more difficult to manage than the first because of its intangible nature. Inevitably the knowledge worker will be the best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job. In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and process that will help the knowledge worker will be best equipped to understand the full requirements of any particular job. In this case, managers must act as facilitators, setting up the structures and processes that will help the knowledge worker's development and allow for the efficient interaction of human capital with the other elements of the intellectual capital framework.

It emphasizes explicit behavioural constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct. Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing. Philosophically, computational law sits within the Legal Formalist school of jurisprudence. Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in civil law settings, where laws are taken more or less literally. It is less applicable to legal systems based on common law, which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations. However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in de facto rules. From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth. Some systems of this sort already exist.Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. . TurboTax is a good example. And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances ‚Äì including the prevalence of the Internet in human interaction and the proliferation of embedded computer systems (such as smart phones, self-driving cars, and robots).  History  Speculation about potential benefits to legal practice through applying methods from computational science and AI research to automate parts of the law date back at least to the middle 1940s.18 Rocky Mntn. L. Rev. 378 (1945-1946) Does the Law Need a Technological Revolution; Kelso, Louis O. Further, AI and law and computational law do not seem easily separable, as perhaps most of AI research focusing on the law and its automation appears to utilize computational methods. The forms that speculation took are multiple and not all related in ways to readily show closeness to one another. This history will sketch them as they were, attempting to show relationships where they can be found to have existed. By 1949, a minor academic field aiming to incorporate electronic and computational methods to legal problems had been founded by American legal scholars, called jurimetrics.33 Minn. L. Rev. 455 (1948-1949) JurimetricsThe Next Step Forward; Loevinger, Lee Though broadly said to be concerned with the application of the \\"methods of science\\" to the law, these methods were actually of a quite specifically defined scope. Jurimetrics was to be \\"concerned with such matters as the quantitative analysis of judicial behavior, the application of communication and information theory to legal expression, the use of mathematical logic in law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic and mechanical means, and the formulation of a calculus of legal predictability\\".Loevinger, Lee. \\"Jurimetrics: The methodology of legal inquiry.\\" Law and Contemporary Problems (1963): 5-35. At 8. These interests led in 1959 to the founding a journal, Modern Uses of Logic in Law, as a forum wherein articles would be published about the applications of techniques such as mathematical logic, engineering, statistics, etc. to the legal study and development.\\"About Jurimetrics.\\" About the Journal. American Bar Association Section of Science & Technology Law and the Center for Law, Science & Innovation, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. . In 1966, this Journal was renamed as Jurimetrics.Ibid, Today, however, the journal and meaning of jurimetrics seems to have broadened far beyond what would fit under the areas of applications of computers and computational methods to law. Today the journal not only publishes articles on such practices as found in computational law, but has broadened jurimetrical concerns to mean also things like the use of social science in law or the \\"policy implications [of] and legislative and administrative control of science\\".Ibid. Independently in 1958, at the Conference for the Mechanization of Thought held at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, Middlesex, UK, the French jurist Lucien Mehl presented a paper both on the benefits of using computational methods for law and on the potential means to use such methods to automate law for a discussion that included AI luminaries like Marvin Minsky.Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958.

The latter type of machine would be able to basically do much of a lawyer's job by simply giving the \\"exact answer to a [legal] problem put to it\\".Ibid. 768. By 1970, Mehl's first type of machine, one that would be able to retrieve information, had been accomplished but there seems to have been little consideration of further fruitful intersections between AI and legal research.Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick, Stanford Law Review, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 40. There were, however, still hopes that computers could model the lawyer's thought processes through computational methods and then apply that capacity to solve legal problems, thus automating and improving legal services via increased efficiency as well as shedding light on the nature of legal reasoning.Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick Stanford Law Review,Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 51-60. By the late 1970s, computer science and the affordability of computer technology had progressed enough that the retrieval of \\"legal data by electronic and mechanical means\\" had been achieved by machines fitting Mehl's first type and were in common use in American law firms.Legal Decisions and Information Systems. Jon Bing and Trygve Harvold. Oslo, Norway: Universitets Forlaget; 1977Niblett, Bryan. Computer Science and Law. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. 7-8. Print. During this time, research focused on improving the goals of the early 1970s occurred, with programs like Taxman being worked on in order to both bring useful computer technology into the law as practical aids and to help specify the exact nature of legal concepts.See, e.g., L. Thorne McCarty, Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 837-895 (1977). Nonetheless, progress on the second type of machine, one that would more fully automate the law, remained relatively inert.Supra, Niblett, p. 7-8. Research into machines that could answer questions in the way that Mehl's consultation machine would picked up somewhat in the late 1970s and 1980s. A 1979 convention in Swansea, Wales marked the first international effort solely to focus upon applying artificial intelligence research to legal problems in order to \\"consider how computers can be used to discover and apply the legal norms embedded within the written sources of the law\\".B.

In a 1988 review of Anne Gardner's book An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Legal Reasoning (1987), the Harvard academic legal scholar and computer scientist Edwina Rissland wrote that \\"She plays, in part, the role of pioneer; artificial intelligence (\\"AI\\") techniques have not yet been widely applied to perform legal tasks. Therefore, Gardner, and this review, first describe and define the field, then demonstrate a working model in the domain of contract offer and acceptance.\\"Rissland, Edwina. \\"Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning: A Discussion of the Field and Gardner's Book.\\" AI Magazine 9.3 (1988): 45. Eight years after the Swansea conference had passed, and still AI and law researchers merely trying to delineate the field could be described by their own kind as \\"pioneer[s]\\". In the 1990s and early 2000s more progress occurred. Computational research generated insights for law.See, e.g., Kades, Eric, \\"The Laws of Complexity & the Complexity of Laws: The Implications of Computational Complexity Theory for the Law\\" 49 Rutgers Law Review 403-484 (1997) The First International Conference on AI and the Law occurred it 1987, but it is in the 1990s and 2000s that the biannual conference began to build up steam and to delve more deeply into the issues involved with work intersecting computational methods, AI, and law.Rissland, E.

Classes began to be taught to undergraduates on the uses of computational methods to automating, understanding, and obeying the law.See, e.g., this syllabus from Stanford for CS 204 Computers and Law.

Further, by 2005, a team largely composed of Stanford computer scientists from the Stanford Logic group had devoted themselves to studying the uses of computational techniques to the law.\\"Stanford Computational Law.\\" Stanford Computational Law. Stanford University, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. Computational methods in fact advanced enough that members of the legal profession began in the 2000s to both analyze, predict and worry about the potential future of computational law and a new academic field of computational legal studies seems to be now well established. As insight into what such scholars see in the law's future due in part to computational law, here is quote from a recent conference about the \\"New Normal\\" for the legal profession: :\\"Over the last 5 years, in the fallout of the Great Recession, the legal profession has entered the era of the New Normal. Notably, a series of forces related to technological change, globalization, and the pressure to do more with less (in both corporate America and law firms) has changed permanently the legal services industry. As one article put it, firms are cutting back on hiring \\"in order to increase efficiency, improve profit margins, and reduce client costs.\\" Indeed, in its recently noted cutbacks, Weil Gotshal's leaders remarked that it had initially expected old work to return, but came \\"around to the view that this is the ‚Äònew normal.‚Äô\\"The New Normal provides lawyers with an opportunity to rethink‚Äîand reimagine‚Äîthe role of lawyers in our economy and society. To the extent that law firms enjoyed, or still enjoy, the ability to bundle work together, that era is coming to an end, as clients unbundle legal services and tasks. Moreover, in other cases, automation and technology can change the roles of lawyers, both requiring them to oversee processes and use technology more aggressively as well as doing less of the work that is increasingly managed by computers (think: electronic discovery). The upside is not only greater efficiencies for society, but new possibilities for legal craftsmanship. The emerging craft of lawyering in the New Normal is likely to require lawyers to be both entrepreneurial and fluent with a range of competencies that will enable them to add value for clients. Apropos of the trends noted above, there are emerging opportunities for \\"legal entrepreneurs\\" in a range of roles from legal process management to developing technologies to manage legal operations (such as overseeing automated processes) to supporting online dispute resolution processes. In other cases, effective legal training as well as domain specific knowledge (finance, sales, IT, entrepreneurship, human resources, etc.) can form a powerful combination that prepares law school grads for a range of opportunities (business development roles, financial operations roles, HR roles, etc.). In both cases, traditional legal skills alone will not be enough to prepare law students for these roles. But the proper training, which builds on the traditional law school curriculum and goes well beyond it including practical skills, relevant domain knowledge (e.g., accounting), and professional skills (e.g., working in teams), will provide law school students a huge advantage over those with a one-dimensional skill set.\\"\\"The Future of Law School Innovation (Conference @ColoradoLaw).\\"Computational Legal Studies. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. . Many see perks to oncoming changes brought about by the computational automation of law. For one thing, legal experts have predicted that it will aid legal self-help, especially in the areas of contract formation, enterprise planning, and the prediction of rule changes. For another thing, those with knowledge about computers see the potential for computational law to really fully bloom as eminent. In this vein, it seems that machines like Mehl's second type may come into existence. Stephen Wolfram has said that: :\\"So we're slowly moving toward people being educated in the kind of computational paradigm. Which is good, because the way I see it, computation is going to become central to almost every field. Let's talk about two examples‚Äîclassic professions: law and medicine. It's funny, when Leibniz was first thinking about computation at the end of the 1600s, the thing he wanted to do was to build a machine that would effectively answer legal questions. It was too early then. But now we‚Äôre almost ready, I think, for computational law. Where for example contracts become computational. They explicitly become algorithms that decide what's possible and what's not.You know, some pieces of this have already happened. Like with financial derivatives, like options and futures. In the past these used to just be natural language contracts. But then they got codified and parametrized. So they‚Äôre really just algorithms, which of course one can do meta-computations on, which is what has launched a thousand hedge funds, and so on. Well, eventually one's going to be able to make computational all sorts of legal things, from mortgages to tax codes to perhaps even patents. Now to actually achieve that, one has to have ways to represent many aspects of the real world, in all its messiness. Which is what the whole knowledge-based computing of WolframAlpha is about.\\"Wolfram, Stephen. \\"Talking about the Computational Future at SXSW 2013‚ÄîStephen Wolfram Blog.\\" Stephen Wolfram Blog RSS. N.p., 19 Mar. 2013. Web. 17 Apr. 2014. .  Approaches  = Algorithmic law = There have also been many attempts to create a machine readable or machine executable legal code. A machine readable code would simplify the analysis of legal code, allowing the rapid construction and analysis of databases, without the need for advanced text processing techniques. A machine executable format would allow the specifics of a case to be input, and would return the decision based on the case. Machine readable legal code is already quite common. METAlex, an XML-based standard proposed and developed by the Leibniz Center for Law of the University of Amsterdam, is used by the governments of both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to encode their laws. In the United States, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in the May 2013 mandated that all public government documentation be released in a machine readable format by default, although no specific format was mentioned.The White House. Office of the Press Secretary. Executive Order  Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information. N.p., 9 May 2013. Web. Machine executable legal code is much less common. Notable among current efforts is the Hammurabi Project, an attempt to rewrite parts of the United States legal code in such a way that a law can take facts as input and return decisions. The Hammurabi Project currently focuses on the aspects of law that lend themselves to this type of specification, such as tax or immigration laws, although in the long-term the developers of the Hammurabi Project plan to include as many laws as possible. = Empirical analysis = Many current efforts in computational law are focused on the empirical analysis of legal decisions, and their relation to legislation. These efforts usually make use of citation analysis, which examines patterns in citations between works. Due to the widespread practice of legal citation, it is possible to construct citation indices and large graphs of legal precedent, called citation networks. Citation networks allow the use of graph traversal algorithms in order to relate cases to one another, as well as the use of various distance metrics to find mathematical relationships between them.Fowler, J. H., T. R. Johnson, J. F. Spriggs, S. Jeon, and P. J. Wahlbeck. \\"Network Analysis and the Law: Measuring the Legal Importance of Precedents at the U.S. Supreme Court.\\" Political Analysis 15.3 (2006): 324-46. Print.Bommarito, Michael J., and Daniel M. Katz. \\"A Mathematical Approach to the Study of the United States Code.\\" Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications 389.19 (2010): 4195-200. Print.Bommarito, Michael J., Daniel Martin Katz, Jonathan L. Zelner, and James H. Fowler. \\"Distance Measures for Dynamic Citation Networks.\\" Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications 389.19 (2010): 4201-208. Print. These analyses can reveal important overarching patterns and trends in judicial proceedings and the way law is used. There have been several breakthroughs in the analysis of judicial rulings in recent research on legal citation networks. These analyses have made use of citations in Supreme Court majority opinions to build citation networks, and analyzed the patterns in these networks to identify meta-information about individual decisions, such as the importance of the decision, as well as general trends in judicial proceedings, such as the role of precedent over time.Fowler, James H., and Sangick Jeon. \\"The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent.\\" Social Networks 30.1 (2008): 16-30. Print. These analyses have been used to predict which cases the Supreme Court will choose to consider. Another effort has examined United States Tax Court decisions, compiling a publicly available database of Tax Court decisions, opinions, and citations between the years of 1990 and 2008, and constructing a citation network from this database. Analysis of this network revealed that large sections of the tax code were rarely, if ever, cited, and that other sections of code, such as those that dealt with \\"divorce, dependents, nonprofits, hobby and business expenses and losses, and general definition of income,\\" were involved the vast majority of disputes.Bommarito, Michael J. \\"Empirical Survey of the Population of US Tax Court Written Decisions, An.\\" Va. Tax Rev. 30 (2010): 523. Some research has also been focused on hierarchical networks, in combination with citation networks, and the analysis of United States Code. This research has been used to analyze various aspects of the Code, including its size, the density of citations within and between sections of the Code, the type of language used in the Code, and how these features vary over time. This research has been used to provide commentary on the nature of the Code's change over time, which is characterized by an increase in size and in interdependence between sections. = Visualization = Visualization of legal code, and of the relationships between various laws and decisions, is also a hot topic in computational law. Visualizations allow both professionals and laypeople to see large-scale relationships and patterns, which may be difficult to see using standard legal analysis or empirical analysis. Legal citation networks lend themselves to visualization, and many citation networks which are analyzed empirically also have sub-sections of the network that are represented visually as a result. However, there are still many technical problems in network visualization. The density of connections between nodes, and the sheer number of nodes in some cases, can make the visualization incomprehensible to humans. There are a variety of methods that can be used to reduce the complexity of the displayed information, for example by defining semantic sub-groups within the network, and then representing relationships between these semantic groups, rather than between every node.Shneiderman, Ben, and Aleks Aris. \\"Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates.\\" IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 12.5 (2006): 733-40. Print. This allows the visualization to be human readable, but the reduction in complexity can obscure relationships. Despite this limitation, visualization of legal citation networks remains a popular field and practice.

He was very successful in several of his endeavors. However, in 1857 he was accused of the murder of a mill owner in Portage, Wisconsin. Despite two mistrials and an aborted third trial he was not convicted. Nevertheless, the experience left him financially ruined. DuBay was illiterate and signed documents with an X. By others his name was variously spelled Dub√©, Du Bay, and Dubay. Saginaw and Sault Ste. Marie DuBay was born on 10 July 1810 in Green Bay, Illinois Territory, the son of a French trader and a Menominee Indian.Wisconsin Dictionary of History, op cit. At the age of 15, he started working for the sutler at Fort Detroit, and shortly thereafter began working for the American Fur Company in Saginaw. He eventually struck out on his own, and became so successful that the Company bought him out so as to eliminate competition. He then moved to Sault Ste. Marie, where he continued in independent trade. Dubay Street in Waterford Village, Michigan is named for him, as he spent much time in the village while traveling along the Saginaw Trail through Michigan. Rehired by American Fur Company, government interpreter In about 1830, he was re-hired by the American Fur Company as an agent. Eventually he was appointed primary agent at the Ojibwe settlement of Lac du Flambeau. In about 1834, while still employed by the American Fur Company, he established a trading post on the Wisconsin River near present day Knowlton, Wisconsin. The homestead was located in the modern town of Dewey, at the far north edge of Portage County. He claimed it was the place where his father spent a winter in temporary trading quarters. In 1840 he was appointed Indian agent at Fort Winnebago, at the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin river valleys, and he operated a grocery there. The Knowlton homestead was his primary home for the rest of his life, although he frequently traveled back to Fort Winnebago on business. During this period, aside from the trading post, DuBay engaged in several other enterprises, including running a stage line from Portage to Stevens Point. The Knowlton site, known as DuBay's Point or DuBay's Crossing,Du Bay Trading Post (Historical Marker), Wisconsin Historical Society is now inundated by Lake DuBay. Despite being illiterate, DuBay knew four Indian languages, and at various points during this period he was employed in treaty negotiations, mostly in the employ of the government but sometimes by the Indians. He was the interpreter for Governor Dodge at the Treaty of St. Peters (1837). Murder in Portage In 1857 while on business to Portage City (as Fort Winnebago became known as), he shot a man in a property dispute. It was a high-profile and sensational murder case. The news was reported as far away as New York in Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. The dispute involved the fact that the American Fur Company had established quarters which DuBay assumed gave him preemption rights. However, preemption could not be granted to business entities, only to individuals, and separately the title was acquired by a Mr. Nelson McNeal, who sold the property to the company of Reynolds & Craig. On the night of Saturday 15 August, DuBay and William Reynolds, one of the principals in Reynolds and Craig, had a confrontation. Accounts vary as to what happened next. The contemporaneous story in the New York Tribune (reprinting the Portage City Record) described it this way: > DuBay was in town and was intoxicated, it is said. During the day he told > several that \\"he would shoot a man before night,\\" that \\"he would learn the > boys a lesson,\\" and other expressions.... DuBay returned from the city, saw > the building, took his ax, and commenced chopping it down.... [I]ntelligence > was carried to Mr. Reynolds of what was going on, who hastened to the spot > and called DuBay a scoundrel. DuBay went into the house, brought out a > double-barreled shot-gun ... pointed at Reynolds [and shot him] just below > his heart, and killed him almost instantly.New York Tribune 1857, op. cit. However, according to his obituary in the Milwaukee Sentinel in 1887: > One day on his return from a hunting expedition with a party of Milwaukee > men, he found the frame of a mill was already erected within his enclosure. > After supper, he proceeded to cut it down, and a moment after it fell, a mob > of thirty men, headed by Reynolds appeared with axes. [DuBay] stood in the > door with a double-barreled shot-gun. He pushed Reynolds away several times, > but he at last seized a weapon and at the point of striking, DuBay fired, > killing him instantly.Milwaukee Sentinel 1887, op. cit. DuBay was arrested almost immediately by the sheriff, who then was confronted with an angry crowd who wanted to lynch DuBay. The sheriff and several other leading citizens were able to convince the crowd to let the law perform its justice, although according to the Sentinel account one of the citizens urging the immediate lynching was one \\"Judge Guppy.\\" The trial was moved to Madison, and DuBay was defended by the prominent lawyers Moses Strong and Harlow Orton. Three former Wisconsin governors ‚Äî James Doty, Nelson Dewey and Henry Dodge ‚Äî testified on his behalf, and twice the jury could not agree on a conviction. A third retrial attempt was made but the proceedings were eventually dropped. Milwaukee Sentinel 1887, op. cit. Wisconsin Dictionary of History, op cit. Later life in Knowlton After the murder trial, DuBay went to his home in Knowlton. According to accounts at the time, he was remorseful over his role in the murder. He lived in poverty at his homestead, and in the last ten years of his life was under direct care of his children. He died there on January 11, 1887. Lake DuBay Lake DuBay is an impoundment of the Wisconsin River north of Stevens Point. The water floods the location of DuBay's homestead. Prior to the dam being built in 1941, an excavation was performed at the homestead site. It was thought that relics and artifacts would be found relevant to the trading post, but as it turned out the site was the location of his home, not the business. Regardless, many artifacts were collected and are now preserved in the Milwaukee Public Museum.

Biography He graduated from Harvard in 1750, and was distinguished at college for his literary attainments and correct deportment. After which he was apprenticed to Ebenezer Robie of Sudbury, who had been educated in Europe, and a disciple of the renowned Boerhaave, and was an eminent physician. Dr. Oliver's distinguished professional acquirements; his prompt and unremitted attention to the sick; his tender and pleasant demeanor while treating them in their distress; his moderate charges and forbearance to the poor, together with the general success which attended his practice,, operated to render him for nearly half a century, one of the most popular while he was one of the most eminent and useful physicians in the Commonwealth. He was one of the original members of the Mass. Medical Society at its incorporation in 1781, and an honorary member of sundry medical societies. He was president of the Middlesex Medical Society during the period of his existence.and then practiced medicine in Groton. He returned to Harvard to get an M.A. in 1753. Dr. Prescott took and early and decided part in the American Revolution by entering warmly into those measures which were necessary to vindicate our national rights, and by assisting cheerfully and largely in their defense. He received many important appointments. In the militia he was appointed by the King a major, then lieutenant colonel and colonel. In 1776 he was appointed a brigadier general for Middle-sex county by the executive council of Mass Bay: he also was in the same year chosen a member of the board of war. In 1777 he was elected a member of the Supreme Executive Council; and 1778 he was appointed the third major general of the militia throughout the Commonwealth. He was elected town clerk of Groton from 1765 to 1777, inclusive (13 years). In 1779, he, Dr. Oliver, was appointed to the office of judge of probate, &c.;, for the county of Middlesex, which he retained until his death. In 1781 he was appointed second major general of the militia, but soon tendered his resignation by reason of other important duties. In 1781 Dr. Prescott received from government a commission to ‚Äúcause to be arrested and committed to jail, any person whom he should deem the safety of the Commonwealth required to be retained of his personal liberty, or whose enlargement within the Commonwealth is dangerous thereto.‚Äù He with his brother James and Jonathan and Amos Lawrence, and eleven others, were appointed to a committee to see that the resolves of the continental congress relative to the ‚ÄúTest Oath,‚Äù so called, ‚Äúbe faithfully carried into effect.‚Äù Dr. P. was incorporated a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780. Also, one of the trustees of the Groton Academy, and the first president of the board. He was in stature full six feet in height, somewhat corpulent, and possessed and ever practiced a peculiar suavity and politeness of manners, and a gentlemanly deportment, which strongly endeared him to the people, always commanding esteem and respect. He and Lydia Baldwin were wed in 1756. Three of their seven children died in an epidemic of 1765/6. From 1779 until his death, he was judge of probate for Middlesex County. In 1780 he became one of the original fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he was a trustee, patron, and benefactor of Groton Academy. Son His son, also named Oliver (4 April 1762, Groton - 26 September 1827, Newburyport, Massachusetts), He graduated at Harvard in 1783. He prepared for college at Dummer Academy, Byfield Parish, Newbury, Mass.; entered Harvard Coll. In 1779; grad. In 1783; studied medicine with his father, but completed his professional education with Dr. James Lloyd, a celebrated physician of Boston. He was admitted a licentiate by the censors of the Mass. Medical Society in June, 1786. He was appointed surgeon to regiment under Col. Henry Woods, which, together with other regiments was under command of Gen Lincoln. These troops were collected and organized for the purpose of suppressing the Shay‚Äôs rebellion. He was afterward made surgeon of the 6th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the militia, which he held until he resigned in 1800. In 1800 he was elected a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society, and was afterward one of its counsellors. He delivered the Annual Discourse before the Society in 1813, and in 1814 received the honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine from Harvard College. In 1825 he was elected a member of the Corporation of the Massachusetts General Hospital, and was elected Vice President of the Medical Society in 1827. Dr Prescott had a very extensive practice in his native town of Groton, and the towns adjacent. Dr. Prescott was repeatedly, and for many years, called by the citizens of Groton to participate in the management of their municipal affairs, being chosen town clerk, selectman, (of which he was chairman from 1804 to 1811) was repeatedly, 1809-1810, and on, chosen a representative to the General Court. He was one of the original founders of Groton Academy, and was a trustee and treasurer of the Institution, and manifested a laudable zeal for the promotion of education and science. Leaving a large practice in Groton, he removed with his family from Groton to Newburyport, in February, 1811, hoping to receive benefit from a residence near the sea, together with a greater regularity of life enjoyed by physicians in compact settlements. Here his practice soon became extensive and continued so until his death in 26 September 1827 after a short illness of typhus fever, in his 66th year. He contributed articles to the New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery, but is best known for a discourse before the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1813, entitled a \\"Dissertation on the Natural History and Medicinal Effects of Secale Cornutum, or Ergot,\\" which was republished in London, and translated into French and German.Oliver Prescott.

(BTI) is a global distributor of bicycle components and accessories, based in Santa Fe, New Mexico. BTI also participates in the community through cycling advocacy on local and national levels. The company is privately held and does not disclose its sales figures. History Andrew Wright and Preston Martin founded Bicycle Technologies International, Ltd. (BTI) in Ashland, OR in 1993. BTI introduced the bicycle industry's first service center that bike shops could send shock absorbers to for tuning and repair, known as Shock Treatment. BTI's first wholesale catalog, also released in 1993, was a twenty-four page newsprint flyer with hand-illustrated schematic drawings of every major fork design. From the beginning, BTI fostered a close relationship with early suspension manufacturers, offering a full line of replacement components. Today BTI provides suspension repair, tuning and other authorized warranty center services for 18 major brands. By 1996, the company was looking for a more central location from where they could serve dealers on both coasts. With the help of friends the young company packed up its inventory and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Over time, BTI expanded its selection with more shop essentials covering every aspect of the modern bicycle. BTI now stocks over 22,000 unique SKUs from nearly 300 brands. =New Facility= In June 2012, BTI publicly unveiled its plans for a new facility. The company announced plans to make a significant investment in a new 47,500 square foot building that will expand the current warehouse operation and will bring two other facilities back under one roof. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez spoke at the event, praising BTI for creating quality jobs in the state. Santa Fe City Councilwoman Rebecca Wurzberger said BTI was the type of locally grown, green company that Santa Fe wants to attract not only for job creation, but for community building activities as well. She cited BTI's role in organizing the 2012 IMBA World Summit in Santa Fe as an example. Situated on a recently purchased plot of land 5 miles from the current warehouse, BTI's new facility will be the anchor tenant for a new master plan employment zone located next to the Santa Fe Community College and near Rancho Viejo. Architectural plans for this site have been completed by Dekker/Parich/ Sabatini Architects. Klinger Constructors LLC has been contracted to undertake construction upon BTI's acquisition of the property. Brands BTI's high rate of growth is attributed to the company's broad wholesale product selection. BTI offers a full range of accessories, including computers, lights, pumps, nutrition and apparel. Services BTI's Factory Service Center is a suspension and disc brake repair service that bike shops send repairs to when they do not have the time, proper tools or training to process repairs in-house. The department takes in forks for repair and tuning - replacing seals and performance tuning the shock for the specific rider and terrain. BTI also performs warranty repair services for several of its top brands. Advocacy BTI donates funds annually to bicycle interest groups such as Bikes Belong, International Mountain Bicycling Association and National Bicycle Dealers Association. BTI staff regularly attend the annual National Bike Summit in Washington, DC with the New Mexico bicycle delegation. BTI's in-house advocacy team is also involved in Santa Fe City and County policy making. In 2010 BTI launched Advocacy Roundup a program that encourages wholesale customers to donate spare change from purchase transactions to a fund designed to promote the work of advocacy organizations. BTI was recognized for its advocacy efforts by the League of American Bicyclists, who awarded the company Gold level status in its Bicycle Friendly Business category.

After their marriage, however, she does not abandon her dream; she puts away as much money as she can and runs a boarding house to build up their savings. When her friend Joe (Eric Linden) discovers a way to make a permanent dye out of the waste products of the steel mill, she sees her chance. Despite his initial opposition, Jim supports his wife. He tells Joe that he can either sell his invention to the mill owners or they can go into partnership and manufacture the dye themselves. Joe chooses the latter, and Jim builds up the business and becomes extremely rich. Anna resides in a mansion with their young son, Bobbie. On a business trip to New York City, Jim is attracted to golddigger Margot (Gwili Andre) and they begin an affair. When Anna finds out, she confronts her husband. He says he loves Margot and wants a divorce, but Anna refuses to give him one, forcing him to take her to court. At the trial, several bribed witnesses claim that Anna herself has a lover. Under the relentless questioning of Jim's lawyer, Bonelli (J. Carrol Naish), she breaks down in tears. When she learns that she will lose custody of Bobbie, Anna desperately claims that Jim is not the boy's father. This claim causes Jim to admit he paid his servants to perjure themselves and is sentenced to jail. While in prison, his business is wiped out by the scandal and he is left penniless. When he is released after a year, he is too ashamed to go see his wife. He returns to work in the steel mill, but she finds and embraces him.

Background Born a to Jewish family, Wolfson was a war refugee from Wilno (then Poland), at the age of 13, and spent the remainder of the war in Siberia. At 15, he carried his father's dead body over his shoulder to bury him in the frozen tundra, and took responsibility for the support of his mother and younger brother. At 17 he obtained visas, and they immigrated to New York City,where worked for his uncle Mendel Aviv in the electronics business. Eventually, he went off on his own and saw success selling refurbished television tubes to customers in South America. As a young man seeking to make a difference in his new country, Wolfson attached himself to Rabbi Aharon Kotler, working at his side to help build and sustain important causes such as Chinuch Atzmai and Torah Umesorah. Early career Wolfson started developing real estate in the 1960s, eventually building skyscrapers in Manhattan's financial district. In the 1980s he started to leverage his assets to invest in hedge funds. During the following years his wealth grew rapidly, eventually cycling hundreds of millions of dollars. He then became very active in politics. Upon being introduced to Mr. Wolfson for the first time, the chairman of Merrill Lynch asked him how he had acquired his wealth. \\"God gave it to me,\\" Zev replied, without hesitation. He felt no need to expand. He not only believed that God had given him his wealth, but that the money belonged to God, and was only entrusted to him as long as he used it for God's purposes. In the midst of the most intense business negotiations, he almost never failed to take a call regarding one of his projects or from a family member. Into his 70s, he still flew economy class. He would not permit the money with which he had been blessed to become a source of honor. Where other large donors condition their gifts on having buildings named after them, Zev always insisted on the opposite condition ‚Äì that his name not be linked to whatever cause he was supporting. Relationship with Israel and politics In 1985, at a time of hyperinflation in Israel, Wolfson saved Israel hundreds of millions in interest payments by shepherding through Congress an appropriations bill that permitted Israel to refinance existing loans at much lower interest rates by prepaying the existing loans with the benefit of US loan guarantees. In 1989, when Israel was in desperate need of money to absorb hundreds of thousands of refugees from the FSU, Wolfson played a major role in securing $10 billion in US government loan guarantees. Nor were his efforts on behalf of Israel limited to the economic sphere. In 1968, Israel's ambassador to the United States, Yitzchak Rabin, was eager to have language written into the foreign aid bill favoring the sale of Phantom jets to Israel. He turned to Zev to use his connections on Capitol Hill, and it was done. The two men became close friends. A senior Israeli finance ministry official once noted that, \\"when the economic history of the State of Israel is written, Wolfson will be one of the three crucial figures in its first half century, after only David Ben-Gurion and Pinchas Sapir\\", (the long-time finance minister with whom Wolfson worked closely). Working with leading figures in Congress, most prominently Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, he succeeded in having inserted into foreign aid appropriation bills, on several occasions, provisions altering the repayment terms on US governmental loans to Israel, or having the loans changed to grants. The resulting savings to Israel totaled billions of dollars. The vast majority of these lobbying efforts were at Wolfson's individual initiative, based on his keen understanding of where the levers of power in Congress lay ‚Äì an understanding fostered, in part, by frequent reading of the Congressional Record. Former senate majority leader Trent Lott attributed much of his influence in Congress to the fact that he never sought anything for himself. And although Wolfson's DC lobbying efforts took place under the radar, their impact was well known to senior officials in Jerusalem. For approximately two decades, a special section of the annual defense allocations in the Israeli budget was known as Se‚Äôif Wolfson. The monies in that section were directed to projects determined by Wolfson. He persuaded French president Jacques Chirac, for instance, to supply land for Otzar HaTorah schools, which primarily served immigrants from North Africa, and then paid for the building with monies from the Israeli government. Similarly, he obtained millions of dollars via the Israeli government for Jewish education in the FSU. In the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, Wolfson obtained US government funding to build dozens of institutions in Israel, under a provision for schools and hospitals abroad from the USAID budget. Most of those institutions served children of Jewish refugees from Arab lands, a group extremely close to his heart. Once the schools and residential educational centers were built, he was often able to secure further funding from the Israeli government. All these efforts to obtain government funding were the product of his early insight that governments can provide funding at a level far beyond that possible through private philanthropy.  Philanthropy  By the late 1980's however, Wolfson found his ability to fund his projects via either the Israeli or American governments greatly circumscribed. At that point, Wolfson began giving from his personal fortune on a scale perhaps unprecedented in Jewish history. Wolfson had clearly defined goals. His focus was Jewish education and outreach. His activities spanned the globe and he was constantly on the lookout for talented individuals who could make a difference. He was attracted by those who thought big, and often complained that there were not enough high-impact projects for the money he wanted to give. Personal life Wolfson has 10 children, who still continue his business after his death in 2012 at the age of 84. His son Morris Wolfson is one of the founders of Ness Technologies. Rabbi David Fohrman, is a noted author, lecturer and the CEO & the Founder of Aleph Beta His youngest son, Daniel Wolfson is an active investor in technology companies.

Professeur des universit√©s, 17¬∞ section. UFR philosophie-Sociologie. Directrice adjointe de l'UFR de Philosophie-Sociologie ...\\" Her work focused on 17th century- and 18th-century art, and the ways in which people think, talk, and theorize about art. Another theme of her work was the shift, since the 17th century, in how people think about the amateur.  Career  Lichtenstein taught at the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Paris X-Nanterre, and at the University of Paris IV - Paris-Sorbonne, among other places. She published numerous articles in French and American journals. She wad the joint director of a philosophy and sociology training and research unit at University Paris IV-Sorbonne, where she coordinated a master‚Äôs program in aesthetics and philosophy of art. She was also in charge of the series \\"Essays on art and philosophy\\" (Aesthetics and philosophy of art), founded by Henri Gouhier in 1949 and published by Editions Vrin.  The eloquence of color  A central theme of Lichtenstein's work is the reception of color by various disciplines, such as philosophy, art, sociology, and ethics. A focal point for her analysis was the antagonistic relationship between color and the notion of the design or plan of a work (in 17th-century French, the dessein of the work, etymologically related to dessin, drawing). Philosophically suspect due to its material character, morally culpable because of its seductive luster, color, in Lichtenstein's view, has long been deemed aesthetically dangerous, the source of a pleasure and a beauty that does not, at first blush, seem connected with the True and the Good. This is, she argued, one aspect of an ongoing conflict between reason and the universe of sensible forms. Painting not being reducible to drawing, it is a source of disunity and disorder in our systems of knowledge, one which elicits an experience of \\"lack\\" (insuffisance). The history of this conflict, she argued, begins in Platonic thought, which condemns color and rhetoric equally. The arts of speech and those of imagery are thus definitively linked. A central later figure is Roger de Piles, the leader of the Rubenists, the partisans of color (coloris). The Rubenists broke with the Platonic tradition and defended illusion, makeup, and seduction. They shifted, Lichtenstein maintained, the focus to those feminine aspects of representation, that is the suspected and cursed elements. They made these the essence of painting. From that point onward, painting was linked with the linguistically inexpressible. Only the gaze may be spoken of, not the picture itself. This, argued Lichtenstein, was the birth of aesthetics, in the sense that the word was to take on in the 17th century.

The episode was written by Graham Wagner and directed by Jon Favreau. It originally aired on NBC on February 14, 2013. The episode guest stars Bob Odenkirk, Mary Gillis, Collette Wolfe, and Andy Buckley. The episode also features the return of former series regular Zach Woods as Gabe Lewis. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) interviews for a job in Philadelphia, but her potential manager (Odenkirk) reminds her of her former boss, Michael Scott. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) recruits Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to help give his elderly aunt (Gillis) a bath. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) attempts to make Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) feel uncomfortable by hiring their ex-lovers. On February 8, 2013, NBC announced that the episode would be expanded to fill a one-hour television block, although it still counts as one official episode. The episode received largely positive reviews, although many were critical of the episode's extended length, which they argued felt padded. The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis David Wallace (Andy Buckley) scolds Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) for lying about his three-month absence from the office. David later tells Andy that he will not fire him, thanking him for helping him buy the company, but warns Andy that he is on very thin ice. Andy learns that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is dating Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), which they have been holding in secrecy from him in order to make his breakup with Erin easier. Though Andy doesn't figure this out at first, having called Pete \\"Plop\\" for so long he forgot his name, he realizes the truth upon finding a lunch bag with his name on it. Andy attempts to fire Pete, but Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) points out that he can not do this since Pete and Erin already disclosed their relationship. Erin and Pete then both lecture Andy about moving on, claiming that working alongside one's ex-lover does not have to be awkward. To refute this claim, Andy hires both Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice (Collette Wolfe) and Erin's ex-boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). After giving Pete and Erin time to appreciate how uncomfortable this is, he holds a meeting with them and their ex-lovers, leading the two couples to argue with each other. Andy tells the camera that seeing Erin and Pete unhappy has made him feel better. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) interviews for a job in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) requests the help of Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) in caring for his ailing Aunt Shirley. Angela initially refuses, but gives in when Dwight begins describing her ailments in grotesque detail. At the house, Angela is horrified by Dwight's treatment of his Aunt: he consistently speaks to her in a condescending tone, proposes to cut off her worn-out clothing with a utility knife, and \\"bathes\\" her by spraying her with a high-pressure water hose like a cow. After subduing Dwight by spraying him with the hose, Angela insists on washing and grooming Shirley in a more dignified manner. Through the process, Dwight and Angela recall their feelings for each other. At the end of the day, they begin kissing, but Angela reminds Dwight that she is married and says she will not leave her husband even though he does not care for her. Dwight accepts this, admitting that he would want that same loyalty from her if she were his wife. Toby has been discussing the details of the Scranton Strangler case with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for some time, feeling the guilty verdict he helped deliver was rushed. Having grown weary of the subject, she snaps at him that he should do something about it. Toby accordingly goes to the local prison to talk to the person convicted of being the notorious local murderer and tell him he believes he is innocent. Offscreen, the convict begins strangling Toby for his part in the conviction. However, Toby does have his spirits lifted, realizing he was guilty and after Nellie gives him a lift from the hospital and commends him for his bravery. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) queues up a television show on his computer, and while the ad loads, he does gravity boot sit-ups. While he is struggling to get down, the camera zooms in on an upcoming television guide on Oscar's computer screen that reveals that the in-series documentary‚Äîcalled The Office: An American Workplace‚Äîwill air in May. Production The episode was directed by Jon Favreau. \\"Moving On\\" was written by series producer Graham Wagner, making it his second episode for the series after the earlier ninth season episode \\"The Target\\". The episode was directed by filmmaker Jon Favreau, marking his first directing credit for the series and the first time he has directed for a television comedy since Fox's Undeclared. Fischer noted that, because Favreau got his start as an actor in \\"quiet, character based comedies\\", his directing of The Office was a \\"return to that\\" type of comedy. On February 8, 2013, NBC announced that the episode would be expanded to fill a one-hour television block, although it still counts as one official episode. The episode guest stars Bob Odenkirk‚Äîwho had previously been considered for the role of Michael Scott‚Äîas Pam's potential employer, Mary Gillis as Aunt Shirley, and Andy Buckley as David Wallace. The episode also features the return of former series regular Zach Woods as Gabe Lewis. Woods was introduced in the sixth season episode \\"Sabre\\" and was added to the series as a regular with the premiere of the seventh season. Woods's contract was not renewed at the beginning of the ninth season, but series showrunner Greg Daniels revealed that Woods would be returning; he noted \\"It's kind of a neat story turn ... He's going to come back and we're all excited to see him back\\". Cultural references When he is being yelled at by Wallace, Andy references American rapper Vanilla Ice and musician Jon Bon Jovi. Andy gives Clark (Clark Duke) various nicknames, including Clarker Posey (a reference to American actress Parker Posey), Clarkwork Orange (a reference to the novel A Clockwork Orange and the film of the same name), and Zero Clark Thirty (a reference to the film Zero Dark Thirty). At the Philadelphia office, Mark alludes to pop culture, with references to the 2011 film Horrible Bosses and the 2012 film Django Unchained. He also sings the K-pop hit \\"Gangnam Style\\" by Psy, and reads Pam's resume as if he were Bob Dylan. Mark also makes a reference to the Spanish Inquisition sketch from Monty Python, but misattributes it to the Canadian sketch comedy group The Kids in the Hall. Near the end of Pam's interview, Mark questions her on whether she enjoys the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm; Odenkirk actually had a role in the third episode of the first season of Curb Your Enthusiasm. The title of the in-series documentary, The Office: An American Workplace, is the name given to the series itself when it was broadcast in the UK to differentiate it from the British version of the show. Broadcast and reception =Ratings= \\"Moving On\\" originally aired on NBC on February 14, 2013.

This marked a slight decrease in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Vandalism\\". The Office ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the CBS police procedural Person of Interest which received a 3.0/8 percent rating, and an entry of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy which received a 2.8/8 percent rating. The ratings for \\"Moving On\\" were the best for NBC in the 9‚Äì10 pm Thursday timeslot since November 8, 2012. =Reviews= Jeff Alexander of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\". Damon Houx of Screen Crush called the episode the \\"highlight\\" of the season. In particular, he was pleased with the way Pam and Jim's strife was portrayed; he wrote that \\"tonight the ... drama felt earned in a way it hadn't previous\\" and that \\"Jim and Pam were used well\\". Houx was also extremely pleased with Odenkirk's performance, writing that, \\"Even if Odenkirk is doing an impression of Steve Carell's character, not only is it great for the non- comedy comedy, but you can totally see a parallel universe where Odenkirk played Michael Scott and nailed it as well as Carell did.\\" He concluded that, with Odenkirk's presence, \\"In about twenty seconds this became the best episode of the season.\\" Kelly West of Cinema Blend gave a moderately positive review, noting that the entry \\"dealt with some of the ongoing issues among the staff of Dunder Mifflin. With the exception of a pretty great guest appearance by Breaking Bads Bob Odenkirk (Better call Saul!) and some interesting developments in the relationship department for some of the characters, the episode was fairly standard. And then came the very end, which offered an interesting reveal and a teaser of something big.\\" IGN writer Roth Cornet awarded the episode a 6.9, denoting an \\"okay\\" episode. She called the episode \\"the real beginning of the end\\". Cornet, however, was critical of the episode's length, specifically pin-pointing the Philadelphia scenes, noting that they \\"went on too long\\". She concluded that \\"I feel for the writers, who I honestly believe were forced to stretch their content this season\\", as well as for the episode. Nick Campbell of TV.com was unhappy that the episode did not show or comment on Pam and Jim's fight in the previous episode. He felt that the beginning of the dinner scene was nice, due to the two's banter. However, he felt that the end pretended as if they had not discussed the move in any previous episodes. Campbell felt that Odenkirk was used in a good way, but that was \\"a waste of amazing talent at the real estate office\\". He also felt that Dwight and Angela's kiss was a good progression for their story. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode \\"C‚Äì\\", and criticized its extended nature. He said that it was \\"both brimming with narrative yet straining to fill its allotted time.\\" Adams argued that elements, like Toby's visit to the prison, seemed like tacked on codas intended to increase the length of the show. He also felt that Odenkirk's performance was humorous, but dragged on too long and played the joke too far. Adams, however, was complimentary towards Angela and Dwight's subplot, calling it the most \\"daring\\" of the episode's various subplots, and saying it provided momentum for the episode. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode \\"unpleasant', largely due to Andy's presence; he felt that the character \\"continues to dominate the action and crush all the goodwill generated earlier in the season\\". However, he was very pleased with Odenkirk's performance, calling his acting \\"a pretty spot-on recreation of the early years [of The Office]\\". Bob Odenkirk's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an \\"Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series\\" Emmy consideration.

History Andrews was born in Epping, near London, the fifth of eleven children of solicitor Richard Bullock Andrews sen. and his wife Emma Ann. Richard Bullock Andrews (1823‚Äì1884), best known as Justice Andrews of the Supreme Court of South Australia, was his eldest brother. After a few years preparing for a law degree he changed his mind and started training for the ministry at Radley College, near Oxford, though he was a sickly youth and little hope was held for his surviving long enough to take orders. His brother Richard had emigrated to South Australia in 1851, and encouraged by him, and sensing career opportunities, William and a younger brother set sail in the Norna on 27 April 1854 and arrived in Adelaide on 28 July 1854 with letters of introduction to Bishop Short from Dr. Tattam of Essex, staying with brother Richard for a few weeks. He began his church career as a catechist at Balhannah and Woodside, supervised by Dean Farrell, Bishop Short being absent in England. On 29 June 1855 (St. Peter's Day), he was ordained deacon in Holy Trinity church, Adelaide, by Bishop Short, and served as curate of Balhannah and Woodside under the Rev. John Fulford, of Blakiston. In 1856 he was ordained a priest and was posted to a missionary position in the South-East, serving Naracoorte, Penola, Guichen Bay, and Mount Gambier districts, which meant a lot of travel by horseback, a severe trial for one without a strong constitution. At that time, although the farms were extremely lucrative, conditions were primitive and Church facilities almost non-existent. 15 months later, Andrews was forced to relinquish his post by an attack of typhoid, and was posted to St. James' Church, Blakiston, which served both Mount Barker and Nairne, replacing Rev. Fulford. Andrews served there for six years, then five years at St. Michael's, Mitcham, then in 1868 returned to Mount Gambier, which had become a thriving town, with a handsome church, schoolroom, and parsonage, largely thanks to the work of Dr. William Browne. He was there five years before returning to the city, to take St. Bartholomew's, Norwood in 1874. In 1881 he was made honorary Canon, and full canon of St Peter's Cathedral in 1890. He served the diocese in this capacity until his retirement in 1914. He acted as rural dean of Kensington from 1889 to 1892, and again from 1895 to 1902. From 1902 to 1907 he was rural dean of the suburbs of Adelaide. On his retirement in 1914, he purchased a home \\"Wonnaminta\\" in Crafers, where he died.Wonnaminta was previously the summer residence of pastoralist Robert Henry Kennedy (1826‚Äì1895) Family Andrews married Barbara Smith (8 November 1829 ‚Äì 12 May 1912) at Comaum station on 30 December 1857 during his first stint in the South-East.

Around the same time, she received word that a second set decorator was needed in the art department for the film, The Blues Brothers (1980).

Built in the Queen Anne style by the architect Richard Norman Shaw, it is a Grade II* listed building. It was commissioned by the painter Marcus Stone as a \\"studio-home\\" for himself. The house was designed by architect Richard Norman Shaw in the Queen Anne style. Shaw was well acquainted with members of the art establishment, being friends with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris and Philip Webb.Dakers 1999, p. 157. The choice by Fildes and Stone of Richard Norman Shaw as the architect of their houses was an important symbol of their ambition to become academicians, members of the Royal Academy of Arts, and of the art establishment themselves.Dakers 1999, p. 158. The imposing houses and studios that Shaw designed would impress potential patrons. The house is next to the home of George Frederick Watts, and backs on to the garden of the Leighton House Museum, the former \\"studio-home\\" of Frederic, Lord Leighton. Stone's studio occupied the whole of the first floor of the house. The house is now separated into flats. Following Stone's death the house was occupied by artist Percyval Tudor-Hart. The film director Michael Powell lived at the house from 1951 to 1971 and shot parts of his controversial 1960 film Peeping Tom at the house. It was the first of two houses in Melbury Road designed by Shaw, the second, Woodland House, 11 Melbury Road (now 31), was designed for fellow painter Luke Fildes. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Luke Fildes wrote of his house that it was \\"a long way the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by what I hear he says of his, but my opinion is the universal one.\\" Stone moved into 8 Melbury Road with his wife, Laura Broun, the daughter of a merchant.StoneODNB. Stone and Luke Fildes were the first two artists to build studio-houses in Melbury Road. In 1994 English Heritage commemorated Stone with a blue plaque at 8 Melbury Road. A green plaque placed by the Directors Guild of Great Britain on the house commemorates Michael Powell. Notes References *Dakers, Caroline.

It belonged to an emerging movement of experimental independent theater companies located mainly in Lisbon. During 1976 the group spent most of its time touring the country. The Europa Year Book of 1983 listed it as one of the main Portuguese theater companies of the period following the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974. The group was described at the time as the most popular of the independent theater companies in Portugal. Maria do C√©u Guerra and stage director and playwright H√©lder Costa have managed the company since its foundation. Costa has written, transcribed and staged many of the shows presented by the group. During his time of exile in Lisbon, the Brazilian playwright Augusto Boal participated in directing the company. He left a strong influence on the group's repertoire. The actor M√°rio Viegas first appeared with the company. In 1976 the company moved to precarious facilities at the top of Rua Alexandre Herculano, near the Largo do Rato. In 1989 they were granted the Cinearte theater in Largo de Santos by the Lisbon City Council for a period of 25 years. The theater was also used as a cafe-concert space. On 4 March 2011 the theater group celebrated 35 years with a party that feted two of the leading figures in its history, Augusto Boal and the actress Fernanda Alves. Rita Lello put on a special staging of the play Angel City by Sam Shepard.  Theatrical productions The theatrical productions of A Barraca are mainly adaptations of historical and political subjects to the popular, traditional and modern format of narrative theater. The company has a special focus on national production, due to the subsidies allocated to it by the state. Augusto Boal A Barraca debuted in March 1976 in the Incr√≠vel Almadense theater with Cidade Dourada (Golden City) by La Candel√°ria. This was a great success. In September of that year it mounted the show Hist√≥rias de fidalgotes e alcoviteiras (Stories of Squires and Pimps) staged by H√©lder Costa and based on scripts by Gil Vicente and Ruzante. In 1977 it presented the show Ao qu'isto chegou! - Feira portuguesa de opini√£o, including the drama A Lei √â a Lei (The Law is the Law) by Luiz Francisco Rebello. When Augusto Boal was with the company in 1977‚Äì78 he directed three plays including Barraca conta Tiradentes (1977). In 1978 the company presented the piece Jos√© do Telhado about the famous Portuguese villain Jos√© do Telhado, with musical arrangements by Zeca Afonso. The music was released in 1979 as the album Fura, Fura. A Barraca produced some of its greatest successes in the 1980s. In 1980 it presented √â menino ou menina? (Is it a boy or girl?), a collage of pieces by Gil Vicente arranged by Maria do C√©u Guerra and directed by Helder Costa. The company made an interesting contribution to the history of representations of works by Gil Vicente. In the same year the group first visited Brazil. It showed Preto no branco, a version of Accidental Death of an Anarchist by Dario Fo. The repertoire also included D. Jo√£o VI by H√©lder Costa. M√°rio Viegas played the sovereign and caused much amusement by his interpretation of the king as a chicken eater, who walked around with pieces of poultry in his pockets. The group was described as a \\"large international theater company\\" during its limited engagement in Rio de Janeiro. In 1983 the company presented Um dia na capital do Imp√©rio (One day in the capital of the Empire), with a script by Ant√≥nio Ribeiro Chiado and staging by H√©lder Costa. In 1984 A Barraca produced Santa Joana dos Matadouros (Saint Joan of the Stockyards) by Bertolt Brecht, considered one of the greatest successes of the company, and in 1986 produced Calamity Janes, with a highly acclaimed interpretation by Maria do C√©u Guerra. Maria do C√©u Guerra in D. Maria, a Louca In September 2010 A Barraca was asked to re-enact the play O Mist√©rio da Camioneta Fantasma (The Mystery of the Phantom Coach) as part of the official program for the Centenary Celebration of the Republic. On 20 July 2011 the group debuted the production D. Maria, a Louca (Maria the Mad), with script by the Brazilian author Ant√≥nio Cunha and staging by Maria do C√©u Guerra. On 10 April 2013 the A Barraca company debuted Menino de Sua Av√≥ (His Grandmother's Boy), an unpublished text by the playwright Armando Nascimento Rosa, a creation of Maria do C√©u Guerra and Ad√©rito Lopes. This production was included in the closing celebrations of the Year of Portugal in Brazil, performed in the Teatro Dulcina in Rio de Janeiro on 3, 4 and 5 May 2013 .

Fisher is an American horror crime author, comics book writer and publisher best known for creating a Jeffrey Dahmer comic book. Early life and education Fisher graduated in 1992 with a fine and applied arts bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. While still in college, he founded Boneyard Press, a publishing company, which released the comic book based on Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer. Career In 1992, upon the release of the comic Jeffrey Dahmer: An Unauthorized Biography of a Serial Killer, protests occurred in Milwaukee, where Dahmer lived,Johnson-Elie, Tannette. \\"Dahmer comic book in demand in city\\" Milwaukee Sentinel May 14, 1992; pp. 1, 13A. and in Fisher's home town of Champaign, Illinois.Williams, Celeste. \\"Comic book on Dahmer sparks protests\\" Milwaukee Journal June 14, 1992. In August 1994, a suit filed by Dahmer's family against Boneyard Press and Fisher for the unauthorized release of the book was dismissed by a Milwaukee judge. In the early 1990s, Hero Illustrated magazine included Fisher on its \\"100 Most Important People in the Comic Book Industry,\\" calling him the \\"most dangerous man in comics.\\" Fisher appeared in a 1993 episode of the \\"Sally Jessy Raphael\\" show to discuss criticism surrounding the creation of the Dahmer comics. He also discussed the comic book on a panel at the 2011 SXSW convention in Austin, Texas. The \\"Larry King Live\\" show in 2008 included a segment with Fisher about Jeffrey Dahmer memorabilia, including Fisher's comics. The episode also features a young Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance, an employee of Fisher's at the time. From 1995 to 1998, Fisher was a designer and copy writer for Sampson West Advertising. In 1995, he co-authored the underground comic A Taste of Cherry with Christian Moore, which was released by Verotik, where Fisher was co- editor in '94 and '95. In 1998, Fisher published, through Boneyard Press, writer Stephen Elliott's first novel, Jones Inn, as well as Elliott's poetry in the comic book anthology Flowers on the Razorwire. In 2008, Fisher released on DVD the film The Garbage Man, which he wrote and produced, about an African-American serial killer. In the midst of filming in 1993, Fisher's girlfriend, Michelle Davis, was raped and murdered by Eric Daniels during an armed motel robbery, where she worked. Daniels was convicted of her murder and given a death sentence. But in 2001, then-Illinois Gov. George Ryan commuted Daniels' death sentence to life in prison. Fisher testified for the prosecution at Daniels' trial. In 2008, Fisher, as reported by Rolling Stone magazine, accused former protege Gerard Way, an American musician and comic book writer, of promoting the claim that Way's Umbrella Academy release by Dark Horse was his first foray into comic book writing. Boneyard Press 13 years earlier had published Way's first comic book when he was 15, On Raven's Wings. Also in 2008, he founded the film company American Horrors, a horror channel on FilmOn. Fisher lives in Los Angeles, California. Despite the discrepancy in timing, the still image used by Rolling Stone featuring Gerard Way asking a question during Fisher's appearance on the Sally Jesse Raphael show has a watermark by American Horrors, implying the still is somehow from one of Fisher's projects.

It aired weekdays at 1:00 p.m. before Kapampangan News. It was the first regional newscast produced by CNN Philippines that premiered under its predecessor Solar News Channel and the first national newscast in Cebuano aired nationwide. Background =As Solar News Cebuano= The newscast was first known as Solar News Cebuano, an innovative program by Solar News Channel to deliver its trademark newsgathering into Cebuano language, the second widely spoken language in the Philippines. Solar News Cebuano was launched on January 28, 2013 and was first anchored by Menchu Macapagal. =Cebuano News= The newscast was then rebranded into Cebuano News on July 21, 2014 upon the impending acquisition of Solar Television Network to the ALC Group of Companies a month later, with a new titlecard and graphic introduced on August 25, 2014 following channel's rebrand to 9TV. The current incarnation was launched on March 16, 2015 in lieu with the launch of CNN Philippines along with a CNN-themed graphics and a revamped news studio. Prior to its current incarnation, the text in the lower third of the screen and most of its graphics used the Cebuano language. However, the text was switched to the English language several weeks before the launch of CNN Philippines. On February 15, 2016, Cebuano News and Kapampangan News reduced their timeslot from their half-hour running time to 15 minutes. On March 18, 2016, Menchu Macapagal anchored her final newscast on Cebuano News as she was relegated to a regular correspondent but remained anchor of Traffic Center on the afternoons (until her departure on the network on end of October 2016). She was replaced by her relief anchor Jun Tariman, doubling his duty as executive producer of the program. Macapagal, prior to her reassignment had been heavily criticized by viewers due to her notoriety as a former disc jockey. =Cancellation= Cebuano News was quietly axed by the network on March 31, 2017. The cancellation has been lengthily planned by the network partly due to the continuing revamps under Armie Jarin-Bennett and partly due to mounting viewer complaints of both Cebuano and Kapampangan News not limited to be carried by CNN PH's regional stations. A simulcast of CNN Newsroom's 1 AM EDT/12 MN EST slot with Cyril Vanier and Natalie Allen (Monday) and John Vause and Isha Sesay (Tuesday to Friday) replaced both regional newscasts and the 1:30 pm current affairs filler slot on April 3, 2017.

Later that same day the Imperial Japanese Army with some Manchurian volunteers launched a massive attack to retake the village. The Japanese forces consisted of ten armored vehicles and dozens of warplanes, which bombed the village overnight.

The words are by Ernest Dowson. It was published in 1911, and a German translation was made by Delius's wife Jelka Rosen, as Sonnenuntergangs-Lieder.IMSLP The work was first performed at the Queen's Hall in London on 16 June 1911 at an all-Delius concert in the presence of the composer, conducted by his great champion Thomas Beecham.Thompsonian.info The soloists were Julia Culp and Thorpe Bates, with the Edward Mason Choir and Beecham Symphony Orchestra. Other works performed that night were Paris: The Song of a Great City, the Dance Rhapsody, and Appalachia. The occasion was also the first meeting of Delius with Philip Heseltine, then a 16-year-old Eton schoolboy, who had seen a copy of the score and wanted nothing more than to hear it. The school's permission had to be obtained for him to attend the concert. That meeting led to a lifelong friendship between the two, even though Delius was almost 33 years older than Heseltine.Barry Smith, ed., Frederick Delius and Peter Warlock: A Friendship Revealed Songs of Sunset was dedicated to the Elberfeld Choral Society, whose chief conductor Hans Haym was one of Delius's greatest supporters in Germany.Stone Records The Elberfeld chorus performed it first in 1914.

E. Mason ‚Äì \\"Dogs of all Nations\\" Rigel was a large black Newfoundland dog who was said to have saved some of the survivors of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. One account of the story was published in the New York Herald, April 21, 1912, the other was the book Sinking of the Titanic and Great sea disasters by Logan Marshall, published in 1912. However, although the story has been widely reproduced, there is doubt about whether the dog actually existed. Dog Rigel was said to have been owned by William McMaster Murdoch, the First Officer of the . Murdoch died in the sinking, but Rigel swam away, and stayed close to one of the lifeboats (Boat #4, in some accounts). When arrived on the scene looking for survivors, Rigel began to bark. The lifeboat had drifted under the bows of the Carpathia, and was at risk of being run down, but the people in the boat were too exhausted to make themselves heard. Rigel's barks alerted Captain Arthur Rostron, who ordered the engines stopped and began the search for survivors. Everyone in the lifeboat was saved, and Rigel was pulled from the icy water after three hours, unaffected by the experience. The dog was too large to be pulled from the water by hand, but a seaman aboard the Carpathia, Jonas Briggs, managed to get a canvas sling under its belly, with which it was hauled aboard. This story, however, has been the subject of controversy and skepticism. The above narrative has typically been credited to Rigel's inventive savior, Jonas Briggs, who later adopted the dog. But researchers have raised doubts about his role in the story. They note that there is no record of a \\"Jonas Briggs\\" working aboard the Carpathia at the time. Moreover, none of the survivors in lifeboat number four mentioned the dog in their accounts of their rescue. The Carpathia had also stopped her engines long before picking up Lifeboat 4, which rowed towards her rather than the other way around. Also, contrary to the legend (which claims that conditions were foggy), witness testimony and photographic evidence show that conditions were perfectly clear the morning after the disaster. So the story is very likely untrue. Another theory, most notably advocated by Stanley Coren, claims that the Carpathias Master at Arms, John Brown, adopted Rigel, while \\"Brigg\\" was the name of a passenger aboard one of the lifeboats (however, there was no Titanic survivor of that name either). In this telling, John Brown retired soon after the incident and took the Newfoundland with him to his home in rural Scotland. There, the dog lived to an old age. The source for this is a 1962 interview that Brown's granddaughter gave for BBC radio. However, while the story has unmistakable similarities, she did not directly connect it to the legend, saying that her grandfather never determined the dog's name or owner. The story remains anecdotal, as no verified Titanic or Carpathia passengers or crew mention the dog in their own accounts. The website WilliamMurdoch.net, dedicated to the life of Murdoch, rejected the story as a myth on 4 key points: 1) There is no evidence that William Murdoch nor his wife Ada had a dog, let alone a black Newfoundland. Richard Edkins, who runs the website Murdoch of the Titanic (also dedicated to Murdoch's life) and is affiliated with Murdoch's surviving relatives, dismissed the story as \\"arrant rubbish\\", saying neither Murdoch nor Ada owned a dog. 2) There is no evidence that a \\"Jonas Briggs\\" was ever a crew member aboard the Carpathia. 3) The account, if true, would have been witnessed by dozens of people in boat no.4 and aboard the Carpathia, but there is no evidence that anyone else, including Rostron, ever reported such a story. And 4) If true, the crew of the Carpathia would have been under obligation to return the dog to Murdoch's widow Ada rather than simply assuming they could adopt it, something which Second Officer Lightoller, as a personal friend of the Murdoch's, would have ensured. None of the surviving officers mention such a dog being on board, which would surely have been notable, and they make no mention of it in a letter they sent to Ada shortly after the disaster to express their condolences. The webmaster speculated that the story was invented because newspapers in the days after the disaster were offering money for Titanic stories, that it spread because it provided a more hopeful tale at a time when troubling rumors of Murdoch's demise were circulating, and that it has endured due to its popularity among dog lovers. They write \\"the story seems to have struck a chord with many who overlook the fact that it has no basis in fact.\\" Notes and references Citations Sources   * Further reading * See also * Animals aboard the RMS Titanic * Legends and myths regarding RMS Titanic * List of fictional dogs External links  *Did Murdoch have a dog called Rigel?

Management of the construction was undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. By 2009, the center had been made operational. The center is managed by experienced active and retired special forces personnel and qualified training staff. About The King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center (KASOTC) is indeed a one-of-a-kind facility in the region. It was conceived to be a training hub for elite forces, law enforcement, and counter-terrorism operators not only in the region but worldwide. KASOTC offers trainees a unique opportunity to gain experience and knowledge and to interact with similar forces from other countries, which will create a pool of highly qualified professionals who can meet the challenges of cross-border threats. The center‚Äôs instructors come from all over the world and were carefully selected in light of their very strong qualifications and solid experience, which is a tremendous asset to all those who participate in training at KASOTC. KASOTC derives extraordinary success from this unique combination of elite instructors and advanced technology. When knowledge is combined with experience, a maximizing effect occurs to skills obtained, making the KASOTC experience unique to all other training facilities. It is the only reality-based, live-fire training facility of this kind in the world. Operated as a commercial enterprise, it is uniquely integrated with the Jordanian Armed Forces. This relationship is a bold innovation; providing access to military equipment and support that expands all training horizons. Located north of Amman, Jordan in an old rock quarry, the twenty-five (25) square kilometer facility is safe, secure, and isolated. It is equipped with multiple distance ranges; from a 1300-meter unknown distance range to a 300-meter, moving target range to accommodate most firearm requirements. It has a four-story, close-quarters battle (CQB), live-fire structure and the largest mock city in existence, 67 buildings, which include numerous arrangements from an Afghan village to an embassy. Special battlefield effects, live-fire compatible throughout, with a fiber-optic network connecting the Range Operations Control Center (ROC) to the hundreds of cameras, microphones, target systems, and simulators make testing the user's creativity in tactics, techniques, and procedures a reality. Together with on- site lodging, dining, gym, pro-shop, weapons/equipment rental, and storage; people can easily see why KASOTC is the ideal place to do what in necessary to prepare forces for the challenges of 21st-century armed conflict. Training As a turn-key facility, the center is ideal for pre-deployment training, joint and combined military exercises, or enhancing proficiency of unit requirements. All curricula are scalable to unit size and training needs. Courses begin in the classroom, where trainees master abstract concepts and discuss creative solutions. Trainees then apply their knowledge and skill in a variety of field exercises; simulating real-world conditions including live- fire & maneuver. Performance is observed, measured, and evaluated using state- of-the-art feedback systems. Facilities The Urban Area contains a wide range of urban and village facilities (56) to simulate realistic neighborhoods, including embassy, residential areas, commercial and industrial facilities, and government buildings; a public square; villas, apartment complexes, and servants quarters; community center, garage, gas station, and shops; light industrial areas; office complexes; and water reservoirs. Urban Area An Airbus 300 houses a full-scale A300 aircraft model and control tower with a helicopter landing pad. The A300 also includes some B777 aircraft features and includes initiating targets to stand up from their seats, introduction of smells/sounds of the battlefield and video/audio capture of all training inside and out. A300 and CQB The close-quarters battle (CQB) house is a two-story armored facility with an adjoining three-story tower that provides room-to-room combat practice using live fire. Designed to train for assaults on a major stronghold using a variety of methods including simultaneous foot, vehicle and helicopter approaches. Assaults can be conducted using entry techniques on multiple levels including assaults through multiple floors and rooms. KASOTC facilities that utilize battlefield effects All the aforementioned facilities takes full advantage of the battlefield effects controlled by the Range Operations Control Center that are audio/video captured using 350 cameras that are fixed through the training areas; the cameras vary between day/night and indoor/outdoor. This capability provides for two purposes, firstly it can be used for the training officer to direct the troops on the ground remotely from the control center, and for the After Action Review (AAR) exercise in which the performance is observed, measured, and evaluated with the trainees. The Method of Entry (MOE) facility is a suite of facilities to allow the tactical training of method of entry techniques. The facilities contained in this area include various breaching stations, steel cutting station, the Method Of Entry Building and a space for construction to meet client‚Äôs specific request (mud walls, etc.). The MOE building is a two-story structure used to train forces in methods of entry techniques. The 8 story Commando Tower is also a platform for wall climbing, fast roping and rappelling. The electronic shooting ranges have provide for Moving Target Engagement and Falling Plates, Grouping and Zeroing, and Weapon Testing. The Driver Track enables Non-Emergency Vehicle Operations (NEVO) to safely instruct and practice non-conventional driving techniques, such as evasive maneuvering, high-speed turn negotiation, skid control, and vehicular pursuit. The range is designed to allow travel in both directions, so that a trainee can practice making turns and maneuvers in opposite directions. Vehicles and maintenance provided on-site. The Annual Warrior Competition The Annual Warrior Competition is an annual combat-oriented competition that is based on physical ability, team work, communication and individual accuracy which takes place at the King Abdullah II Special Operations Training Center KASOTC in Amman, Jordan.

The mixtape features guest appearances from Rick Ross, French Montana, Popcaan, Travis Scott, Troy Ave, Kevin Gates, Andrea Martin and Wale. Production varies from Kanye West, Young Chop, Jake One and The Neptunes, among others. Wrath of Caine was released via mixtape distribution site LiveMixtapes and was also made available for free digital download on DatPiff, accumulating 75,000 after its unveiling. The eleven-track mixtape was highly anticipated since it was announced. It served as promotion leading up to the release of Pusha T's debut studio album My Name Is My Name (2013). Background On November 11, 2012, Pusha T announced he would be releasing a mixtape titled \\"Wrath of Caine\\". The mixtape was originally expected to have been released at the end of 2012. On January 15, 2013, the cover art for \\"Wrath of Caine\\" was released. On January 17, 2013, the trailer for \\"Wrath of Caine\\" was released. On January 24, 2013, during an interview with Miss Info the Clipse member said Wrath of Caine is a collection of lyrically-driven street anthems, comparable to the music he recorded with his brother and Clipse cohort No Malice, saying: > \\"Wrath of Caine is basically just me catering to my core. It's all about > just street Hip Hop, street music. It's just something that I like to do. > It's something that I feel like has no boundaries, no parameters. I can do > what I really, really want to do‚Ä¶[my approach to the mixtape is] not about > more of a creative [decision], I just think it's about more of what I want > to hear for myself and what my fans want to hear. They want to hear lyrics, > they want to hear street [music]‚Ä¶it's just the whole street life > perspective.\\" On January 27, 2013, during an interview with Miss Info, Pusha T discussed \\"Millions\\" featuring Rick Ross, track 2 off Wrath of Caine which was released prior to the mixtape, saying: \\"It's basically an ode to dope boys and stash spots; it's just an ode to that energy,\\" he said. \\"I'm trying to make music and recreate that energy that I feel was missing in Hip Hop, [the energy] like you roll down your windows, you hop in your car and you front until you pull up to the club. Right now, that energy is sort of missing to me, and I feel like 'Millions' is a prime example of what that is.\\" Release and promotion On December 5, 2012, the first song was released in promotion of the mixtape titled \\"Blocka\\" featuring Travis Scott and Popcaan. On December 11, 2012, the music video for \\"Blocka\\" featuring Travis Scott and Popcaan was released. On January 20, 2013, the music video was shot for \\"Millions\\" featuring Rick Ross and it was released on February 10, 2013. On January 29, 2013, \\"Millions\\" was released as the second single from the mixtape. On January 31, 2013, the music video was shot for \\"Doesn't Matter\\" featuring French Montana and it was released on February 18, 2013. On March 15, 2013, Pusha T released the trailer for the music video for \\"Trust You\\" which features Kevin Gates and the music video was released on April 1, 2013. Critical reception Wrath of Caine was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX said \\"Pusha is essentially on cruise control for the duration of his freebie prelude to My Name Is My Name. None of this is to say that Wrath of Caine isn‚Äôt worth the five minutes it should take to download and play or stream it on the device of your choice. Even when most of his focus is likely on his upcoming Def Jam long player, Pusha T can show off, be humble, recount his rock chopping days and actually rap with the best of them. And in a bleak, boring first quarter, that‚Äôs more than a lot of people are offering\\". Ralph Bristout of XXL gave the mixtape an XL rating, saying \\"Clocking at a little over half an hour, Wrath Of Caine, although a quick fix, serves as an overall potent listen. It‚Äôs no doubt that Pusha is at his best‚Äîdisplaying the same championed vernacular that‚Äôs crowned him underground king since he first instructed ‚ÄúPlayas we ain‚Äôt the same, I‚Äôm into ‚Äôcaine and guns,‚Äù on his Clipse advent LP, Lord Willin‚Äô. Succinct while covering all necessary bases‚Äî‚ÄúBlocka‚Äù and ‚ÄúTake My Life‚Äù successfully marries the streets with its kissing cousin, reggae‚ÄîWOC is another batch of pure dope that only Neighborhood P could‚Äôve provided\\". Mike Madden of Consequence of Sound gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying \\"Though not quite a Rich Forever or even a 4eva N a Day, the 36-minute Wrath of Caine typically sounds like the work of one of rap‚Äôs most exciting voices ‚Äì exactly what it is. Utter misfires like French Montana‚Äôs faceplant of a Future imitation on ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Matter‚Äù notwithstanding, it bangs pretty uniformly. The Rick Ross-assisted ‚ÄúMillions‚Äù is a worthy cousin of ‚ÄúI Still Wanna‚Äù, while the stuttering, propulsive ‚ÄúBlocka‚Äù is stocked with Pusha‚Äôs prince-of-darkness seethe: ‚ÄúAll praise to the most high on both sides / I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won‚Äôt lie\\". Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave the mixtape a 7.2 out of ten, saying \\"Wrath of Caine‚Äôs guests neither add to nor subtract from the proceedings, and where he can, Pusha wisely relegates them to hook duty. After Fear of God‚Äôs withering batch of middling freestyles and rangy originals and Fear of God II‚Äôs pervasive sense that the artist with top billing was a guest on his own album, Wrath of Caine is really the first hint of what Pusha-T is capable of as a solo artist. He‚Äôs not really relatable anymore, and hard times are distant memories rather than palpable realities, but he‚Äôs still got sharp wit and snarling lyrical intensity to fall back on, and Wrath of Caine thrives off of that gritty elan.\\" On December 23, 2013, XXL named it the seventh best mixtape of 2013. They commented saying, \\"Pusha T‚Äôs Wrath of Caine serves as a prelude to his debut solo album, My Name Is My Name, quite beautifully. The dope rap master displays his vernacular and lyrical ability by constructing addictive street records. It‚Äôs a short tape but very easily a great listen that serves as a fix to Pusha‚Äôs fans.\\" Track listing Notes * signifies a co-producer * \\"Blocka\\" features uncredited vocals by Travis Scott and Popcaan.

Geography Kotipalli railway station is located in the fringe areas of Konaseema region on the Godavari delta. History The Kakinada-Kotipalli branch line was first laid in 1928, but was removed in 1940 with the onset of World War II. The British rulers, then ruling in India, were facing shortage of steel and took away the tracks for use somewhere else. The line was relaid at a cost of Rs. 67 Crores (670 million). It was formally opened in November 2004. However, that was only a partly finished project. The balance of the project The total project envisaged construction of two lines ‚Äì the first from Kakinada to Kotipalli, and the second from Kotipally to Narsapur via Amalapuram. The 2001-02 estimates for the Kotipalli-Narsapur line was Rs. 710 Crores (7.1 billion). The estimates are high because three bridges need to be constructed across three distributaries of the Godavari: first, a bridge across the Gautami between Kotipalli and Mukteswaram, second, a bridge across Vainateya, between Bodasakurru and Pasarlapudi, and third, across the Vasista between Narsapur and Sakinetipally. In the context of limited resources for funding projects in India, it is a tall order, and funds are coming only in trickles, as for example Rs. 2 Crores (20million) spent in acquiring 110 acres of land. Obviously, such a project had high-profile backers such as G. M. C. Balayogi who was Speaker of the Lok Sabha from 1998-2002, and S.P.B.K. Satyanarayana Rao, former union minister and MP from Rajahmundry.

He was the abbot of the Buddhist temple Wat Phra Dhammakaya, the post he held until 1999 and again from 2006 to December 2011. In December 2016, he was given the post of honorary abbot of the temple. He is a student of the nun (maechi) Chandra Khonnokyoong, and is the most well-known teacher of Dhammakaya meditation. He has been subject to criticism and government response. However, he continues to be a spiritual leader that has significant influence in Thai society. Luang Por Dhammajayo's approach to Buddhism seeks to combine the ascetic and meditative life with modern personal ethics and social prosperity. Luang Por Dhammajayo met Maechi Chandra in his student years, and learnt about Buddhism from her. During his student years, he met his fellow student who later became known as Luang Por Dattajivo. Luang Por Dhammajayo started teaching together with Maechi Chandra, and in 1970, they started their own temple in Pathum Thani province, later called Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The temple became extremely popular in the 1980s. However, from the 1997 Asian financial crisis onward, the temple and Luang Por Dhammajayo came under heavy criticism for unorthodox fundraising methods, culminating in several charges against him. The charges were withdrawn in 2006, and Luang Por Dhammajayo revived the temple. He organized several notable activities in this period, including a campaign against smoking and drinking for which he was rewarded by the World Health Organization. After the 2014 coup d'etat, Luang Por Dhammajayo again was charged by the Thai government, by then a military junta, for conspiring in money-laundering and receiving stolen goods. These charges have been widely described as politically motivated, but did lead to an arrest warrant and highly publicized standoff in 2016. The junta was, however, unable to find Luang Por Dhammajayo. As of December 2017, the whereabouts of Luang Por Dhammajayo was still unknown, with Phrakhru Sangharak Rangsarit being assigned as official abbot instead.  Biography  = Early life and background = left Luang Por Dhammajayo was born in Sing Buri Province with the lay name Chaiyabun Sutthiphon on 22 April 1944, to Janyong Sutthiphon (his father) and Juri Sutthiphon (his mother). His parents were Lao Song and Thai-Chinese, and separated when he was young. Chaiyabun was raised by his father, who was an engineer working for a government agency. Due to a sensitivity for sunlight, Chaiyabun had to wear sunglasses from a young age. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya's publications, Chaiyabun is described as a courageous child, who would often play dangerous games with his friends. Whilst studying at Suankularb Wittayalai, the owner of the school would bring Chaiyabun to meet with monks regularly. This sparked his interest in Buddhism from a young age. He set up a Buddhist Youth Society together with his fellow students. Chaiyabun developed a strong interest in reading at a young age, especially on Buddhist practice and biographies of leading people in the world, both religious and political. This included a book with teachings from Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro, the founder of the Dhammakaya Tradition, and a magazine about the maechi (nun) Chandra Khonnokyoong. In 1963, while studying economics at Kasetsart University, he started visiting the temple Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen. It was here that he first met Maechi Chandra, a student of abbot Luang Pu Sodh Candasaro, who had by then died. Maechi Chandra was able to answer Chaiyabun's questions, which made him curious to learn more about Buddhism, through the practice of meditation. Under Maechi Chandra's supervision, Chaiyabun attained a deeper understanding of Buddhism. Chaiyabun got to know many fellow students both in Kasetsart University and in other universities who were interested in practicing meditation, and encouraged them to join him in learning meditation with Maechi Chandra. One of these early acquaintances later became a Buddhist monk and Luang Por Dhammajayo's assistant: Phadet Phongsawat, now known as Luang Por Dattajivo, who would become the deputy abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. When Chaiyabun met Phadet, Phadet was involved in occult practices (), and would often hold public demonstrations of such practices for his fellow students. In Wat Phra Dhammakaya's biographies it is told that every time Chaiyabun joined to watch one of Phadet's demonstrations, Phadet was incapable of doing his performance. Phadet therefore become curious about Chaiyabun, suspecting that Chaiyabun was affecting his occult demonstrations. Later on, when Phadet tried to persuade Chaiyabun to drink alcohol at a college party, Chaiyabun refused, citing his adherence to the five Buddhist precepts. To test Chaiyabun, Phadet then decided to bring him to his occult black magic teacher. However, even the teacher could not use his powers in Chaiyabun's presence, which convinced Phadet to learn more about Dhammakaya meditation from Chaiyabun. From that moment on, they remained friends and Phadet became Chaiyabun's assistant. = Ordination as monk = During his university years, Chaiyabun wanted to stop his studies to ordain as a monk. However, Maechi Chandra and Chaiyabun's father persuaded him to finish his degree first. They argued that Chaiyabun could do more benefit to society if he was both knowledgeable in mundane and spiritual matters. During university, he took a lifelong vow of celibacy as a birthday gift to Maechi Chandra, inspiring many of her students to do the same. After his graduation from Kasetsart University, he was ordained at Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen on 27 August 1969. He received the monastic name \\"Dhammajayo\\", meaning 'The victor through Dhamma'. At his ordination, Phra (meaning 'monk, venerable') Dhammajayo took a vow that he would work to bring progress to Buddhism. A university degree in the Thailand of the 1960s could lead to a good job and social standing, making Chaiyabun's decision to ordain uncommon. Once ordained, he started teaching Dhammakaya meditation together with Maechi Chandra. In the beginning, the meditation courses were carried in a small house called 'Ban Thammaprasit' in the Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen compound. Because of the popularity of both teachers, the house soon became overcrowded with interested students and they considered it more appropriate to start a new center by themselves. Although initially they intended to buy a plot of land in Patum Thani, the landowner Khunying Prayat Suntharawet gave a plot four times the requested size to celebrate her birthday. Thus, on 20 February 1970, Maechi Chandra, Phra Dhammajayo, Phra Dattajivo and their students moved to the 196 rai (313,600 m2) plot of land to found a meditation center. A book about the initiative was compiled, to inspire people to join in and help with the building of the meditation center. The site eventually became an official temple in 1977 and was later named Wat Phra Dhammakaya. = Life as abbot = link=Ordination ceremony for new monks at Wat Phra Dhammakaya Phra Dhammajayo later became abbot of the temple and was called Luang Por (meaning 'venerable father') Dhammajayo from then on. In the early years, Maechi Chandra still had an important role in fundraising and decision- making. However in years to follow, this would gradually become less, as she grew older and withdrew more to the background of the temple's organization. From then onward, Luang Por Dhammajayo received a greater role. The temple gained great popularity during the 1980s (during the Asian economic boom), attracting up to fifty thousand people on major ceremonies. In the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Luang Por Dhammajayo came under widespread criticism and an investigation from the Sangha Supreme Council. The main criticism was that the temple was using fundraising methods that did not fit in with Buddhism. One of the accusations investigated was that Luang Por Dhammajayo had moved land donated to the temple to his own name. The temple denied this, stating that it was the intention of the donors to give the land to the abbot and not the temple. During this time, a letter with the then Supreme Patriarch's signature was leaked to the press implying that Luang Por Dhammajayo had to disrobe for not returning the land. However, the authenticity of the letter was put into question. Eventually the Sangha Council declared that Luang Por Dhammajayo had not broken any serious offenses against monastic discipline (Vinaya). Despite this, the charged Luang Por Dhammajayo with embezzlement and removed him from his post as abbot. During this period, many Thai news reporters used pejorative language in describing Luang Por Dhammajayo, as well as members of the Sangha Supreme Council. Monastic chiefs nationwide sent letters to the Prime Minister over concerns about the media's language toward the Sangha. Widespread negative media coverage at this time was symptomatic of the temple being made the scapegoat for commercial malpractice in the Thai Buddhist temple community.Julian Gearing (1999) Buddhist Scapegoat?: One Thai abbot is taken to task, but the whole system is to blame Asiaweek 30 December 1999 < In 1999, Wat Phra Dhammakaya filed several successful slander suits against various news outlets. In an interview held in the same year, LP Dhammajayo stated he understood the government's anxiety about Buddhist movements with large gatherings, but still felt perplexed about the controversies.Luang Por Dhammajayo sitting in the Ubosot at Wat Phra Dhammakaya. In the 2000s, Luang Por Dhammajayo began a nationwide anti-smoking and drinking campaign. This project led the World Health Organization (WHO) to present him with a World No Tobacco Day award in 2004. In 2005, over one hundred religious organizations joined the campaign and successfully stopped the listing of liquor company Thai Beverage on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would have been the biggest listing in Thai history. In 2006, the running lawsuits against Luang Por Dhammajayo were withdrawn by the Attorney-General, citing that Luang Por Dhammajayo had moved all of the disputed land to the name of the temple and that continuing the case would not benefit the public. His position as abbot was subsequently restored. Five years later, Luang Por Dhammajayo stepped down as abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, with Luang Por Dattajivo taking over as caretaker abbot, although this was not widely known at the time.  Since the 2014 coup d'√©tat  New investigations against Luang Por Dhammajayo appeared following the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat. The military junta created a National Reform Council with a religious committee led by former senator , (known under the activist name Phra Buddha Issara), and former Wat Phra Dhammakaya monk Mano Laohavanich. In February 2015, Paiboon Nititawan led an unsuccessful bid to reopen the alleged land embezzlement case against Luang Por Dhammajayo from 1999. Meanwhile, Phra Suwit requested the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) to start an investigation in the assets of the Sangha Council's members. This included Somdet Chuang Varapu√±√±o, who was Luang Por Dhammajayo's preceptor (the person who ordained him). In 2015, Luang Por Dhammajayo was implicated in the Klongchan Credit Union controversy when 11.37 billion baht was taken out of the Klongchan Credit Union Cooperative (KCUC) via unauthorized checks, in which a portion totaling more than a billion baht were found to have been given to Wat Phra Dhammakaya via donations. In defense, spokespeople of Wat Phra Dhammakaya explained that Luang Por Dhammajayo was not aware that the donations were illegally obtained. In a written agreement with the credit union, supporters of the temple had raised the money linked to Wat Phra Dhammakaya to donate to the KCUC to compensate their members. Regardless, Luang Por Dhammajayo was summoned to acknowledge the charges of ill-gotten gains and conspiring to money-laundering at the offices of the DSI. The temple requested the DSI to let him acknowledge his charges at the temple due to his deep vein thrombosis, a request the DSI refused. When Luang Por Dhammajayo failed to appear at the DSI office to acknowledge his charges, authorities launched several failed raids of the temple to find him. The standoff led to a 23-day lockdown of the temple in 2017 by the junta using Article 44 of the interim constitution, despite the efforts authorities were still unable to find him. Many reporters questioned the practicality of using Article 44 and so many resources to arrest one person to acknowledge a charge of a non-violent crime, and pointed out the viability of trying him in absentia to determine guilt first. News analysts have speculated that the actions of the Thai junta towards the temple may have reflected a political need to control who should be selected as the next Supreme Patriarch of Thailand. The monk who was next in line for the position, Somdet Chuang Varapu√±√±o, had ordained Luang Por Dhammajayo. Selecting Somdet Chuang would have meant a Supreme Patriarch from the Maha Nikaya fraternity, rather than the Dhammayuttika fraternity, which historically had been the preferred choice by the Thai government and the monarchy. In fact, Somdet Chuang's appointment was withdrawn by the Thai Junta, with another candidate from the Dhammayuttika fraternity appointed instead. The coinciding lawsuits against Luang Por Dhammajayo, and Somdet Chuang's connection to him were, in fact, eventually used as a reason by the junta to withdraw his nomination. In the aftermath of the lockdown additional charges were filed, this time also against the deputy abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo. With both Wat Phra Dhammakaya's honorary and deputy abbot under investigation, the junta pushed unsuccessfully to appoint an \\"outsider\\" abbot to run the temple. The junta stated it was necessary to take over the temple because it is a \\"threat to national security\\". In December 2016, Luang Por Dhammajayo was given the position of honorary abbot by the Ecclesiastical Provincial Chief (governing monk of the region) of Pathum Thani. In December 2017, the temple assigned Phrakhru Sangharak Rangsarit as the temple's new abbot and began announcing the organization of new events. News outlet Kom Chad Luek described this as a \\"revival\\" of the temple, but news outlet Thai PBS stated that the temple had not been affected much by the disappearance of the former abbot. In 2016, Wat Phra Dhammakaya was described as the largest temple of Thailand.  Teachings  Luang Por Dhammajayo's approach to Buddhism seeks to combine the ascetic and meditative life with modern personal ethics and social prosperity. Luang Por Dhammajayo is mostly known for his teachings with regard to Dhammakaya meditation. In his approach to propagating Buddhism he has emphasized a return to a purer Buddhism, as it had been in the past. He has also opposed protective magic and prognostication and refers to these as signs that Buddhism is deteriorating. Many followers in the temple believe that his projects are a product of his visions in meditation. Luang Por Dhammajayo is known for his modern style of temple management and iconography. Luang Por Dhammajayo often uses positive terms to describe Nirvana. Apart from the true self as taught by the Dhammakaya tradition as a whole, religious studies scholar Rachelle Scott notes that Wat Phra Dhammakaya often describes Nirvana as being the supreme happiness, and argues that this may explain why the practice of Dhammakaya meditation is so popular. In its teachings on how meditation can help improve health and the quality of modern life, the temple has been compared to the Vipassana movement of S.N Goenka. The temple's emphasis on meditation is expressed in several ways. Meditation books and CDs are for sale in stores around the temple, and every gathering that is organized by the temple will feature some time for meditation. The temple emphasizes the usefulness of meditating in a group, and sociologist Apinya Fuengfusakul notes that public meditations have a powerful effect on the minds of the practitioners. Luang Por Dhammajayo was heavily influenced by Maechi Chandra Khonnokyoong in her teachings. He turned the Dhammakaya meditation method \\"into an entire guide of living\\" (McDaniel), emphasizing cleanliness, orderliness, and quiet, as a morality by itself and as a support for meditation. In short, Wat Phra Dhammakaya's appearance is orderly, and can be described as \\"a contemporary aesthetic\\" (Scott), which appeals to practitioners, especially the modern Bangkok middle class. Practitioners are also encouraged to keep things tidy and clean, through organized cleaning activities. A strong work ethic is promoted through these activities, in which the most menial work is seen as the most valuable and fruitful. Wat Phra Dhammakaya has a vision of a future ideal society. Wat Phra Dhammakaya is known for its emphasis on meditation, especially samatha meditation (meditation aiming at tranquility of mind). Through Luang Por Dhammajayo's teachings, Wat Phra Dhammakaya started to develop a more international approach to its teachings, teaching meditation in non-Buddhist countries as a religiously neutral technique suitable for those of all faiths, or none. The temple emphasizes that the daily application of Buddhism will lead the practitioner and society to prosperity and happiness in this life and the next, and the temple expects a high commitment to that effect. Through meditation, fundraising activities and volunteer work, the temple emphasizes the making of merit, and explains how through the law of kamma merit yields its fruits, in this world and the next. The ideal of giving as a form of building character is expressed in the temple's culture with the words Cittam me, meaning 'I am victorious', referring to the overcoming of inner defilements (').  Recognition  In 1994, LP Dhammajayo received an honorary degree from the Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University. In 2013, in commemoration of year 2550 of the Buddhist Era, the World Buddhist Sangha Youth (WBSY) presented the Universal Peace Award to LP Dhammajayo at the third WBSY meeting in recognition of his work in disseminating Buddhism for more than thirty years. Other awards that have been given to LP Dhammajayo are the Phuttha-khunupakan award from the House of Representatives in 2009, and a World Buddhist Leader Award from the National Office of Buddhism (2014). Luang Por Dhammajayo was given the monastic title of Phrasudharmayanathera in 1991, followed by Phrarajbhavanavisudh in 1996. In 2011, he received his third and last title Phrathepyanmahamuni. In March 2017, King Rama X approved a request by junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha to remove Luang Por Dhammajayo's title for not acknowledging the charges laid upon him.

Roosevelt. Early life Rutherfurd was born on February 4, 1862. He was the youngest son of seven children born to Lewis Morris Rutherfurd (1816‚Äì1892) and Margaret Chanler Stuyvesant (1820‚Äì1890). His elder siblings included Stuyvesant Rutherfurd (1843‚Äì1909),Stuyvesant Rutherfurd later changed his name to Rutherfurd Stuyvesant in conformity with the will of his mother's great-uncle, Peter Gerard Stuyvesant in order to inherit the Stuyvesant fortune. Louisa Morris Rutherfurd (1855‚Äì1892), Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd (1853-1916), who was married to Henry White, and Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, Jr. (1859‚Äì1901), who was married to Anne Harriman Vanderbilt (1861‚Äì1940). His paternal grandparents were Robert Walter Rutherfurd (1788‚Äì1852) and Sabina Morris (1789‚Äì1857) of Morrisania. He was the great-grandson of U.S. Senator John Rutherfurd and 2x great-grandson of Lewis Morris, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Rutherfurd was a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland before it became New York, as well as John Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts. His mother was the niece and adopted daughter of Peter Gerard Stuyvesant (1778‚Äì1847), the 2x great-grandson of Peter Stuyvesant and Helena Rutherfurd Stuyvesant. His mother's siblings included Elizabeth Winthrop Chanler (1824‚Äì1904) and John Winthrop Chanler (1826‚Äì1877). He was a graduate of Columbia College in 1884. Society life Rutherfurd House in Allamuchy Township, New Jersey Rutherfurd was one of the social elite nicknamed \\"The Four Hundred\\" by Ward McAllister, a number supposedly taken from the capacity of Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor's ballroom. Novelist Edith Wharton described Rutherfurd as \\"the prototype of my first novels\\". In 1902, shortly after his first marriage, Rutherfurd and his wife Alice contracted prominent New York City architect Whitney Warren to design for them a Tudor revival style mansion known as Rutherfurd House. The approximately 38-room home was located alongside his brother Stuyvesant Rutherfurd's property in Allamuchy Township, New Jersey. Besides the mansion, construction included gardens, a boathouse, a swimming beach, a hydroelectric powerhouse, a 9-hole golf course, and kennels. The farm's 1,000 acres became well known for its Holstein cows and Dorset sheep. After his second wedding, in 1920, Rutherfurd built an estate called Ridgeley Hall in Aiken, South Carolina where he pursued his favorite hobby of breeding fox terriers. In 1907, Rutherfurd won the first Best in Show prize of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with his fox terrier Warren Remedy, who would also win in 1908 and 1909. Personal life In 1895, Consuelo Vanderbilt fell in love with Rutherfurd, and Rutherfurd proposed marriage to her. However, Consuelo's mother Alva Vanderbilt forced Consuelo to travel to Europe, and pressured her to marry Charles Spencer- Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, for reasons of title. After Consuelo was persuaded that Alva might suffer a fatal heart attack if Consuelo disobeyed her, Consuelo agreed to forsake Rutherfurd and marry the Duke. Rutherfurd then remained a bachelor until age 40, reportedly having numerous affairs with married socialites, including Ava Astor. In 1926, when Consuelo's annulment was announced, the reason from Rome was that \\"Consuelo, when 17, and in love with 'an American named Rutherfurd,' had been forced by her mother, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, to give him up to marry the Duke.\\" In 1902, Rutherfurd married Alice Morton (1879‚Äì1917), the fourth daughter of former US Vice President Levi Parsons Morton and Anna Livingston Reade Street. Her sister Helen, was married to Paul Louis Marie Archambaud, Boson de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1867-1952), a son of the Charles Guillaume Fr√©d√©ric, Boson de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, Prince de Sagan, and her oldest sister, Edith, was married to William Corcoran Eustis (1862‚Äì1921). Alice died fifteen years later in 1917, leaving behind five sons and a daughter: * Lewis Morton Rutherfurd (1903‚Äì1920), who died age 16. * Winthrop Rutherfurd, Jr. (1904‚Äì1988), who married Alice Polk (1917‚Äì2009), daughter of Frank Lyon Polk, in 1940. * John Phillip Rutherfurd (1910‚Äì1987), who was married to Elizabeth Shevlin (1911‚Äì1957) and Jacqueline Orr (1923‚Äì2004). * Hugo Rutherfurd (1911‚Äì2006), who was married to Francesca Villa (1922‚Äì1995) in 1941. * Alice Rutherfurd (1913‚Äì1953), who married Arturo Peralta Ramos, the former husband of Millicent Rogers, in 1943. * Guy Gerard Rutherfurd (1915‚Äì2012), who married Georgette Whelan (d. 2004) in 1938. In 1913, upon the advice of Anna Roosevelt Cowles, Lucy Mercer was hired as a social secretary to Eleanor Roosevelt, Cowles's niece. In September 1918, Eleanor discovered the affair Lucy had with Eleanor's husband Franklin. The relationship ended and soon, Mercer then became the governess for Rutherfurd's six children. Rutherfurd soon proposed to Mercer, who was almost three decades younger, and Mercer accepted. She was the daughter of Col. and Mrs. Carroll Mercer of Washington. Only weeks before their wedding, which took place on February 11, 1920, Lewis, Rutherfurd's oldest son, died of pneumonia. Various observers described Winthrop and Lucy as devoted to one another, and their marriage as a happy one. Together, they had a daughter: * Barbara Mercer Rutherfurd (1922‚Äì2005), who married Robert Winthrop \\"Bobby\\" Knowles, Jr. (d. 2003) in 1946. Rutherfurd died in Aiken on March 19, 1944 after a long period of failing health. Lucy, who was by FDR's side when he died in 1945, died aged 57, on July 31, 1948. In 1966, both Barbara and Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. denied the relationship between her mother and his father. =Descendants= Rutherfurd was the grandfather of financier Lewis Polk Rutherfurd (b. 1944) who was married to Janet Jennings Auchincloss (1945‚Äì1985), the half-sister of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, from 1966 until her death in 1985.

Elizabethtown Colonel Abraham van Buskirk led the attack into Elizabethtown with 300 infantry under his own command and 60 dragoons of the 17th Light Dragoons under the command of Captain William Steward. They also had a party of Loyalist militia, bringing the total number of this body to about 400. Col. van Buskirk's men were guided into the town by three local men, Job and Smith Hetfield, and Captain Cornelius Hetfield. After crossing the ice from Staten Island to Trembly's Point about 3 miles from Elizabethtown, the British infiltrated the town in two divisions. They plundered some houses and captured the American commander as well as two or three officers and forty-seven colonial soldiers. The loyalist militia burned the Presbyterian church and court house, against the wishes of Col. van Buskirk. By this time the alarm had been raised and the British retreated by way of De Hart's Point, burning De Hart's house on the way because it was frequently used by American forces. Newark The second party crossed the frozen North River on sleighs to Newark, which they entered in three divisions. The British captured fifteen men at the Newark Academy, of which one lieutenant escaped, and then set fire to it. They looted a few houses, including those of Justice Joseph Hedden and Robert Neil, Jr., whom they took as prisoners. Hedden was wearing only a shirt and stockings, but the British would not allow him to fully dress despite the bitter cold. Justice Hedden's wife attempted to intervene and received two bayonet wounds for it. It was later reported that Justice Hedden suffered severe frostbite during his ordeal. The entire attack took less than twenty minutes. The local militia pursued, capturing five British soldiers, two of whom died of hypothermia. According to a British report, taking Hedden was never part of the original plan. His capture and subsequent treatment was at the hand of a loyalist named Walker who had been treated very poorly by Hedden in the past. When the officers later learned that he had not been allowed to dress, they provided him with some clothing. Robert Neil, on the other hand, was a \\"sub-deputy quarter-master\\", and would frequently take crops and firewood from the property of known Tories for distribution to the American army. Aftermath There was almost no long term strategic impact to this raid. Its primary purpose was to harass two colonial garrisons and to further personal vendettas.

It belongs to the Podolic group of grey cattle. It is raised in the regions of Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise and Puglia. It was formerly distributed throughout most of mainland Italy and as far as Istria, now part of Croatia, and where it is now regarded as a separate breed, Istrian cattle. The Podolica was in the past bred principally as a draught animal; with the mechanisation of agriculture following the Second World War demand for draught oxen disappeared, and the Podolica is now raised for meat and, to a lesser extent, for milk. History The origins of the Podolica breed are not known. As with other European grey cattle, it has been suggested that it derives from cattle of the Podolian steppes of eastern Europe, possibly brought to Italy by invading Goths in the fifth century AD or by the Lombard king Agilulf in the sixth century. This hypothesis is based on the zoological theories of the nineteenth century, going back to the Bos taurus podolicus of Johann Andreas Wagner. It is not supported by modern genetic, zoological or archaeological research. There were numerous regional and other types of Italian grey cattle: the Abruzzese, the Calabrese, the Montanara, the Murgese, the Pugliese, the Pugliese del Basso Veneto and others. The name \\"Podolico\\" for grey cattle came into use in Italy from the early 20th century. The need for a herdbook was recognised in 1976; it was established in 1984, and a breed standard drawn up from observation of about 15,000 animals. In 1986 the standards of selection were modified to allow meat production to be favoured over other characteristics. The total population was estimated in 2008 at 100,000 head, of which about 25,000 were recorded in the herdbook. At the end of 2013 the total number registered in the herdbook was 27,509, including 391 registered bulls; more than 80% of the registered stock was in Basilicata and Campania. The breed is considered to be at risk from indiscriminate cross-breeding with bulls of specialised meat breeds. Characteristics The Podolica is a rustic breed capable of surviving on harsh terrain and poor pasture. It can exploit food sources that would not otherwise be used, including stubble, scrub and maquis, and woodland undergrowth. The animals are fed hay and straw only in winter. The colour of the Podolica shows pronounced sexual dimorphism: cows are pale grey, tending to white, while males are darker and may be almost black. As in other breeds of grey cattle, the calves are born wheat-coloured but become grey at about three months. The skin is black, as are the natural openings. The horns are light, lyre-shaped in cows, half-moon-shaped in bulls; they are slate-grey in young animals, becoming pale at the base and dark at the tip with maturity. The breed is of medium size and lightweight; the skeleton is light. The average height at the withers is 145 cm in females, and 150 cm in males; average weight for cows is 650 kg, and 800 kg for bulls. Use The Podolica was in the past mainly kept for draught work; meat and milk production were secondary to this. After the Second World War the progressive mechanisation of agriculture meant that demand for draught oxen disappeared. The breed is now raised mainly for meat; in some areas it is also kept for milk. Calves are weaned no sooner than four months; they are normally sent to slaughter at 15‚Äì16 months, at which time they weigh 300‚Äì350 kg. The meat is considered to be of high quality and carries a registered mark of quality. The average milk yield is low; a figure of 1,500 kg was cited in the 1950s. The milk is used to make caciocavallo; the sought-after Caciocavallo Podolico del Gargano is made only from it.

As of August 2011, Darby is ranked no. 141 in the world by the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM). Darby qualified as a lone competitor for the women's modern pentathlon at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, after the Court of Arbitration for Sport threw out an appeal that questioned her Olympic eligibility. The Greek federation argued that Darby was ineligible because she failed to meet the full requirements of the five-event discipline, when she qualified for the games by winning the Asian & Oceanian Championships in Tokyo, Japan (four of the five disciplines were contested except for equestrian show jumping, because of an outbreak of equine influenza). In the early rounds of the competition, Darby displayed a poor performance by finishing last out of thirty-six athletes in the air pistol shooting event (AP40), with a score of 184 points. Darby eventually placed thirty-first in one-touch √©p√©e fencing, but dropped to thirty-fifth position, when she stopped for up to 10 seconds halfway through the 200 m freestyle swimming race, halted by a pair of malfunctioned googles. Darby quickly moved to the top of the rankings, when she finished seventh in the show jumping segment, knocking off a total of 28 obstacle and time penalties. In the end, Darby finished the event with cross-country running in thirty-fifth place, for a total score of 4,816 points.

They have released music through Hot Creations, Crosstown Rebels and, most recently, Cooltempo. Early career Originally they formed the duo The Benedictions, playing 1960s and 1970s folk rock-inspired music on acoustic guitar. The name of the duo Infinity Ink came when the duo were playing in Moldova on their tour. They noticed a nearby factory that was called 'Infinity Inc'. So they adopted the name changing the \\"c\\" to a \\"k\\", giving it a completely new twist. Infinity Ink found fame through two tracks released in 2012. First was \\"Games\\" on the Hot Creations label followed by the single \\"Infinity\\" on Crosstown Rebels. Infinity was sampled by \\"Flo Rida\\" in his 2013 single \\"Can't Believe It\\". The same year, the duo secured a residency for Jamie Jones paradise party at DC10 in Ibiza, a slot that they still play to this day. Hot Natured Luca Cazal and Ali Love later joined Jamie Jones and Lee Foss to form the live act Hot Natured, who along with Anabel Englund released a string of hits including\\"Benediction\\" and \\"Reverse Skydiving\\". They sold out their debut gig live at Brixton Academy and were the first electronic music act to do so since Leftfield in 1996. Their debut album Different Sides of the Sun was released in 2013 via Warner Bros. Records and Hot Creations. Singles \\"Benediction\\" and \\"Reverse Skydiving\\" both charted with the former reaching number 40 on the UK Singles Chart and the latter reaching number 56. Live shows In 2016, Infinity Ink launched their live show, debuting at 'Elrow Presents Hot Creations' at The Rainbow Venues in Birmingham. The performance incorporated live vocals from Ali Love whilst Luca programmed the drum machines and DJs. The performance at The Rainbow Venues was the start of a full tour spanning the summer festival season. Present day Infinity Ink originally signed to Different Recordings, the electronic imprint of PIAS, for their debut album but instead released four singles with them before parting ways. 2019 has seen the pair sign to Cooltempo, the recently revived dance label owned by Chrysalis Records with plans to release the debut album originally planned for 2016. \\"Rushing Back\\" is the first single from the album and features vocals from singer/songwriter and Rinse FM host, Yasmin.

Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions. Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree. Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story. It is to fiction what the sensory level is to poetry or mise-en-scene is to cinema. Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative. Elements Mood is generally created through several different things. Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a cowboy story and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations. The attitude of the narrator is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is diction, that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it. Difference from tone Tone and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in first-person narratives. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing. The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

He was previously the leader of a Murle insurrection against the South Sudanese government. Early life and education Yau Yau studied theology at Emmanuel Christian College in Yei from 2004 to 2006. Career In 2010, Yau Yau was employed as County Secretary by the South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in Pibor County. Yau Yau ran in the April 2010 Sudanese general election for the Gumuruk Boma seat in the Jonglei State Assembly. The SPLM candidate Judi Jonglei Bioris won by a wide margin. Yau Yau is alternately reported to have been an independent candidate and a member of the United Democratic Front opposition party. =Insurrection= After his failed bid for the state assembly, Yau Yau accused the SPLM of fraud and voter intimidation. On 20 May 2010 he led an armed group in a clash with the SPLA. One casualty was reported by the SPLA. Yau Yau indicated that he was in contact with George Athor, another failed Jonglei candidate who led the South Sudan Democratic Movement (SSDM) into rebellion for similar reasons. Yau Yau signed a ceasefire with the GoSS in June 2011, which integrated him and his militia with the SPLA. He had the rank of Brigadier General in the SPLA. In April 2012 he defected again, and lead a Murle-dominated militia in the South Sudan internal conflict for several years. Yau Yau became the head of the Murle insurrection and the militia that he led became known as the \\"Cobra Faction\\" of the SSDM. A March 2014 peace accord with the GoSS appointed Yau Yau as the Chief Administrator of a newly established, semi-autonomous Greater Pibor Administrative Area, with virtually the same authority as South Sudan's state governors. =Dissolution of Cobra Faction= He gave up the leadership of his Cobra Faction which was dissolved after merger with the SPLM-IO-allied Greater Pibor Forces in January 2016.

He is also a former ZYGO optician and telescope maker and now lives in Hampden, Maine, USA.. In 1999 he established Rich Observatory and has since discovered 26 extragalactic supernovae. Rich has received attention for his work with discovering supernovae. He wrote an article in Astronomy Magazine on the topic and was later featured in Sky and Telescope magazine, which identified him as one of four leading amateurs in the field of discovering supernovae. Rich has had three notable supernova discoveries. SN 2005ay, was a relatively nearby type II-P (plateau) supernova caught soon after explosion. Extensive observations of SN 2005ay in galaxy NGC 3938, with the GALEX Space Telescope and numerous land-based telescopes, helped astronomers confirm the theory that type II-P supernovae can be used as \\"standard candles\\" - a way to measure distances to distant galaxies. SN2010X was an uncommon merger of two white dwarf stars in galaxy NGC 1573A. This rare type of supernova which has spectral characteristics similar to a type Ia, is dubbed a .Ia (point one a) because it is one-tenth as luminous as a normal type Ia supernova and also fades in about one-tenth the time. Another unique discovery, SN2010al, was a rare explosion of a Wolf-Rayet Star in galaxy UGC 4286. This find, also discovered at an early stage, was influential in establishing a new supernova sub-classification - the type Ibn.

He joined the Mexican Army as an infantry soldier in 1990, and ascended to the corporal unit five years later. By 1999, however, Gonz√°lez Castro had resigned and began working for the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas along with several former military men. Considered one of the prolific assassins in his organization, Gonz√°lez Castro commanded and successfully carried out a massive prison break of 25 inmates with other Army deserters in 2004. Gonz√°lez Castro is among Mexico's most-wanted men, and one of the last standing founders of Los Zetas. Criminal career Gustavo Gonz√°lez Castro was born in the Mexican city of Tuxpan, Veracruz on 1 July 1973. He joined the Mexican Air Force, a service branch of the Mexican Army, on 22 March 1990 as an infantry soldier. In 1995, he was the corporal unit, but resigned to enlist in the reserves on 1 August 1999. At some point after leaving the Armed Forces, Gonz√°lez Castro joined the criminal organization known as Los Zetas, which was formed by him and other ex-soldiers who were recruited by the Gulf Cartel under the tutelage of the then-leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n in the late 1990s. In the early 2000s, Carlos Rosales Mendoza, the leader of La Familia drug cartel and close associate of C√°rdenas Guill√©n, was combating the Milenio Cartel for the control of the drug trafficking territories in the state of Michoac√°n. In an attempt to put down the Milenio organization, Rosales Mendoza contacted the Gulf Cartel and asked them to send several gunmen of Los Zetas to help in the fight. C√°rdenas Guill√©n agreed by sending Efra√≠n Teodoro Torres and Gonz√°lez Castro, two of its best hitmen. On 4 January 2004, the Gulf Cartel dispatched several members of Los Zetas, including Gonz√°lez Castro, to perpetrate a larger prison escape in a municipal prison in Apatzing√°n, a city just 200 miles from the nation's capital. Armed with AK-47s and AR-15s and dressed in military uniform, the Zeta gunmen tied up the prison guards and liberated at least 25 inmates, including five high-ranking members of the Gulf Cartel. The Mexican authorities believe that the imprisoned C√°rdenas Guill√©n had possibly ordered this raid in an attempt to predict the likelihood of his escape from La Palma prison. =Status= In late January 2009, several homicides were reported in Guadalajara area, including the discovery of the alleged body of Gonz√°lez Castro, alias El Er√≥tico. The information was not confirmed, and Gonz√°lez Castro remains a fugitive and in Mexico's most-wanted list. He is also one of the last standing founders of Los Zetas who are still at large.

(The execution of the Romanov family took place in Yekaterinburg, where Bakov lives.) Bakov established the Monarchist Party as a part of his \\"Russian Empire\\" project ‚Äîa micronation claiming to be the successor to the former Russian Empire founded by Peter the Great, and pretending to the overseas territories discovered by Russian sailors but not included in the original empire's successor states‚Äîsuch as Suwarrow atoll in the South Pacific, Antarctica and others. Anton Bakov and writer Andrey Matveev present their book \\"Idols of power\\", which explains their modern monarchist conception for Russia.  Attitude  The main declared goals for the party are the promotion of the monarchical idea and the union of Russian monarchists in Russia and abroad. Bakov lists the party's goals as \\"proposing a successor to [the] Throne; proclaiming a political program affordable for Monarchism in the 21st century; and maintaining a proper propaganda to outline the benefits of [a] monarchy, in particular, we have to carefully explain people why Vladimir Putin is not a monarch.\\" He describes the need for a constitutional monarchy: \\"We cannot restore monarchic Autocracy, as it was with the Romanovs, and don't need to. We can only have Constitutional Monarchy. This way we can separate the irrational from the rational. On the one side, we will have a Monarch, who won't have absolute power. On the other, we will have responsible Government, reporting to society; and a Parliament. This way we can keep ourselves from a dictatorship.\\" At the beginning of 2013, Bakov and writer Andrey Matveyev presented their book Idols of Power: from Cheops to Putin. In the book, the authors claim that they found power in the modern Russian Federation and in the former Soviet Union to be the result of the reconstruction of an ancient pagan cult, and monarchy gives them the only constructive direction for Russian politics to move in. In Bakov's words, the work on this book, where they were studying the nature of power and summarizing their political experience, led them to these conclusions and resulted in the creation of the party. Bakov describes the party as being different from other parties because: \\"The fundamental characteristic of the Monarchist Party -what makes us different from all others - is that we are not a democratic party. We support monarchical governance, not republican. Nowadays, most Russians have liberal doctrines installed in their minds that state that a person is master of his destiny, that people can elect power that will accomplish all what it is told to. This is the myth of the 99%.

In early 2014, Bakov announced he views the Russian Throne (See), from the point of international law, as matters of state sovereignty (regardless of any other attributes, referring to analogues with The Holy See). He outlined that Karl Emich, upon accepting the Orthodox religion, received the right to take up this See according to the pre-Revolution Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire. Bakov proposed that the Prince should accept the Throne to form a new and independent state, and incorporate it into Bakov's promotional projects such as the Monarchist Party, virtual state of Russian Empire among others. In April 2014, Bakov and Karl Emich appeared in a newspaper report –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏—è ‚Äì –Ω–∞—à–µ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–µ –∏ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ? ‚Äî \\"–†–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏\\", 10.04.2014 declaring the Prince accepted the proposals as well as the title of Emperor Nicholas III (successor to Nicholas II). In the report, Bakov emphasized that Karl Emich has been an entrepreneur for a long time, but that from now on, he is barred from performing all non-Throne related activity. The report contained a \\"Manifesto of granting the Constitution to the State\\", signed by Nicholas III, proclaiming the formation of the sovereign state \\"Imperial See\\" aimed at consolidating all the people around the world devoted to Christian Monarchism. The See in the documents is viewed as the legacy of the first-ever Christian Roman Imperial Throne of Constantine the Great, passed through the Byzantine Empire to the Russian Empire and the House of Romanov by religious procedures. n:ru:–í–∏—Ä—Ç—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è ¬´–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏—è¬ª —Å –æ–¥–æ–±—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è III –æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å—É–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–µ—Ç ‚Äî Russian Wikinews, 15.04.2014 Later Bakov announced that he had purchased a plot of land in Montenegro to give the new state a location (80 ha, \\"twice as big as Vatican\\"), and was in negotiations with Montenegro's authorities on the state's recognition. –ß–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Ç—ã–π –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª - stend-guest He also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to grant such a plot in Yekaterinburg (Bakov's residence and place of 1918 Romanov assassination) in response to Karl Emich's request n:ru:–ü—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –Ω–∞ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ª –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å –≤ –ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–±—É—Ä–≥–µ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≥ –í–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞–Ω–∞ ‚Äî Russian Wikinews, 23.07.2014 passed to Putin by Bakov, a former MP. –ì–æ—Å—Ç—å ¬´–°—Ç–µ–Ω–¥–∞¬ª ‚Äì –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω –ë–∞–∫–æ–≤, –ü—Ä–µ–¥—Å–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å –ú–æ–Ω–∞—Ä—Ö–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏. ‚Äî 2.06.2014 In early 2015, as a follow-up to the International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis, Bakov told the press there are talks with Montenegro authorities to establish an offshore zone at this plot, aimed at providing financial intermediation to Russian companies. n:ru:–í –ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ—Ä–∏–∏ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—ë—Ç—Å—è –∞–Ω—Ç–∏–∫—Ä–∏–∑–∏—Å–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –æ—Ñ—à–æ—Ä ‚Äî Russian Wikinews, 11 February 2015 Also in early 2015, Imperial Throne representatives were in talks with the authorities of the neighboring Republic of Macedonia and Albania on possible collaboration and future state recognition.

Activities  = Monarchist consolidation = On 1 February 2013 the party held a monarchist congress in Paris, France, where representatives of several Russian monarchist movements gathered to discuss further developments. The Presidium for the Russian Monarchist Movement was created, with representatives of monarchist organisations being invited to join. It is believed that such gatherings will continue in the future. The party has set up a status of \\"Imperial Dynasty Member\\" for people from House of Romanov, and offered a reward of 2,000 euros per month for those of them who claim for it \\"as a sign of respect to people who did many things for Russia, but their properties in Russia were stolen and relatives who left in Russia were killed\\". Creation of a \\"Monarchist Internationale\\" is the part of Bakov's electoral programme for the 2018 elections. = Memorials = The party proposes to set up a guard of honour at the Grand Ducal Burial Vault in St. Petersburg where Cyril Vladimirovich together with his spouse are buried, and to assign funds to finish the reconstruction of the complex. In May 2013 the party organized in Yekaterinburg the creation of a large portrait-monument dedicated to Empress Ekaterina I after whom the city is named. Ekaterina has not been memorialized in the city since the beginning of Soviet times, when the city was renamed Sverdlovsk. This monarchical event coincided with the 400th anniversary of Romanov House. Also discussed were plans for a memorial to Karl, Prince of Leiningen, who died in 1946 in Soviet captivity. He was the husband of Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna and Prince Karl Emich's grandfather. = Objects of interest = In early 2013, the party founded the Imperial Palace Fund aimed at re-creating the three ancient imperial palaces in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg (Podzorny Palace, Srednerogatsky Palace and Belovezhsky Palace). They are supposed to be re-built according to older blueprints not on their historical grounds but at locations suitable to attract tourists.

The candidate for mayor was Bakov's 22-year-old daughter Anastasia, a singer and actress living in Moscow who recently graduated from Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute. She campaigned using references to the city authorities' performance and to God (who is the keeper of monarchy and protector of the people). Also there, 57 students ran as the party's candidates in elections to the City Duma. In 2015 Bakov announced the Party's plans to run for the upcoming 2016 Russian State Duma elections. In early 2016 in an interview with RBC news agency, he confirmed this intention and stated that Anastasia would again become the front person of the planned campaign, and he personally would not run. However, the party did not end up participating. In September 2017 Bakov declared that he would participate in the upcoming 2018 Russian presidential election, being nominated by the Monarchist Party. In the following months Bakov had collected the necessary citizen signatures, submitted documents to the Election Commission, and finally in January 2018 withdrew his candidature due to his double citizenship‚ÄîRussian Federation and Romanov Empire (double citizenship is not allowed for participants). In July 2018 Monarchist Party announced it's going to nominate Bakov's son Ilya, a real estate entrepreneur, as a candidate for 2018 Moscow mayoral election. Ilya Bakov gave a press conference announcing his plans to create an offshore zone in Moscow to attract foreign investment, and to create a federal ministry of Moscow affairs. https://ria.ru/politics/20180613/1522620143.html Electoral status In 2019, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation announced the liquidation of a number of political parties, citing federal law that requires parties to participate in elections within seven years of their establishment. Although it did not take immediate legal effect, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation recommended that the Monarchist Party, along with several other political parties be liquidated given their lack of electoral participation. In accordance to the plan, individuals from the parties would be scrutinized in the following year.

The name is believed to be a corruption of the Algonquin words pohqui, meaning 'broken', and moosie, meaning 'smooth'. It is located in the town of Chesterfield, New York, United States, on New York state Forest Preserve land, part of the Taylor Pond Wild Forest complex within the Adirondack Park. Due to its location next to the pass through which most travelers from the north enter the range, it has been called the \\"gateway to the Adirondacks\\". At its summit is a disused fire lookout tower listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While many of those who reach it and take in the sweeping views of the High Peaks and Lake Champlain hike up one of two trails from U.S. Route 9 near the mountain's base, the stone cliffs ringing its summit have attracted climbers, although their activities are limited during the nesting season of the peregrine falcon. Its easy access from the Adirondack Northway (Interstate 87) and challenging routes have made it the most popular rock and ice climbing spot in the Adirondacks, regularly drawing visitors from both the U.S. and Canada. Geography Poke-O-Moonshine is located at the eastern end of a group of summits at the northeastern corner of the Adirondacks. Most of the peaks to its west are of similar height, though lower; Old Rang Mountain a mile (1.6 km) to the northwest is higher at . To the east is a pass roughly wide, traversed by Interstate 87, locally referred to as the Adirondack Northway, and U.S. Route 9. Across it rises a similar unnamed peak with several summits, the highest of which reaches . alt=A topographic map of the mountain, showing nearby roads and icons for facilities, with a short trail to the summit in blue and a long one nearer the bottom in red It is located in the southern portion of the town of Chesterfield, near its tripoint with the towns of Lewis and Willsboro. The nearest settlements are the central hamlet of Willsboro to the east-southeast and the village of Keeseville to the north-northeast. Both are approximately from the mountain. A ridge connects the mountain to Carl Mountain a mile to the west. On the mountain's east and south, the slopes rise steeply from the pass to the granite cliffs, their main scarp face high and a mile wide, that bracket the summit and the northeast ridge. The north side has a gentler, but deeper, drop into the valley of McGuire Brook, which drains into Butternut Pond to the north and then, via that body's outlet into Augur Lake, to the AuSable River. On the south, a steeper drainage goes to Cold Brook, which flows into the North Branch of the Boquet River. Both streams themselves drain into Lake Champlain, whose Willsboro Bay is east of Poke-O-Moonshine's summit. History Humans have lived in the Adirondacks since at least the end of the Wisconsin glaciation, 10-12,000 years ago. In the 11th century, farming began in the surrounding river valleys, which led many inhabitants to come down from the mountains. The Algonquin, the first humans known to have lived in the area of the mountain, were as struck by its cliffs as later visitors. They named the mountain for them‚ÄîPohquis Moosie, in their language, roughly translates to \\"place of the broken smooth rocks.\\" It was important to them since it stood aside the pass that allowed access to the mountains from the plains next to the lake, and thus became a frequent location for trade and diplomatic meetings between their tribes. Because of the area's remoteness from settlements established during the 17th century by the British and Dutch to the south and the French to the north, European settlers did not come to the area in significant numbers. Since it was vacant, the land was claimed during the 18th century by both the British, who had conquered New Netherland, and the French. King George's War in mid-century failed to settle that claim, and it took the later French and Indian War to establish British hegemony over all the European colonies in the region. Settlement was further delayed by the Revolutionary War, and only afterwards, with the new state of New York owning the land, was it subdivided and sold to veterans. Those first settlers corrupted the Algonquin name to \\"Poke-O-Moonshine.\\"Draft UMP, 8‚Äì9. The lot that includes the mountain's summit reverted to state ownership following a tax sale in 1876. During his lengthy survey of the Adirondacks, Verplanck Colvin used Poke-O-Moonshine's summit as his Station #26, establishing the benchmark that remains today. A high wooden tower was built near it to assist in the survey. alt=A small metallic shed with windows atop a sloping steel latticework. There is rock and shrubbery in the foreground In 1885, the state legislature created the Forest Preserve in response to fears that silt eroding from heavily logged slopes in the Adirondacks would render the Erie Canal unnavigable and adversely affect the state's economy. It required that any state land in certain areas, including Essex County, \\"be forever kept as wild forest lands.\\" A decade later, this was added to the New York State Constitution as Article XIV. In the first decade of the 20th century, droughts led to series of devastating wildfires in the Adirondacks. New York's Forest, Fish and Game Commission (FFGC), a predecessor land-management agency to today's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), decided to follow Maine's example and build fire lookouts on strategically located mountains throughout the range. In 1912 a trail was cut and a wooden tower built atop Poke-O-Moonshine; five years later the current metal tower replaced it. The FFGC, now the Conservation Commission, added other facilities such as a cabin and springhouse during the 1920s. In 1928 writer Walter Collins O'Kane commended the view of Lake Champlain and Vermont from the tower in his Trails and Summits of the Adirondacks. The mountain became a popular hike. In 1940 a guidebook produced by the Federal Writers' Project also endorsed that view, and reported a local legend that the peak's name had acquired a second meaning during Prohibition, when the pass became a popular place to distill and sell illegal liquor to loggers working in camps deeper in the mountains. In 1930 the state built a 25-site campground on three acres () next to Route 9. It began purchasing additional land on and around the mountain the following year. This would eventually prove beneficial to another group of outdoor enthusiasts.Draft UMP, 3‚Äì4. Since the development of technical mountaineering equipment in the early 20th century, climbers had been attempting the many rock cliffs and walls of the Adirondacks. However, this effort had been hampered by the lack of quality roads in the sparsely populated region and the difficulty they posed in getting even to trailheads for those cliffs. In the late 1950s this situation had improved somewhat, and Geoff Smith and John Turner began making many first ascents of many of those cliffs. They particularly concentrated on Poke-O-Moonshine, with Turner's bold (for the time) style allowing him to name and rate many of its routes. alt= A relatively flat-topped mountain rising in the background. The trees near its base have some leaves in fall color. There is a roadway at the bottom, in the foreground. Throughout the rest of the 20th century the hikers and climbers kept coming, aided by the completion of the Northway in the late 1960s. The state continued to buy land when it was available. Better methods of fire detection became available, and the risks of fire declined to the point that DEC closed the fire tower in 1988. Three years later, the observer's cabin was burned down; only the fireplace and foundation remain. In 1995 DEC announced it was planning to dismantle the fire tower. As with many of the state's other historic fire towers, a local organization was formed to raise the funds to save it. It was renovated and reopened three years later. By 2004 the state had acquired 272 additional undeveloped acres () for the campground and brought its mountain holdings to . Five years later, however, during a budget crisis, the campground was shut down due to low use, although it remains open as a day-use access area to the cliffs. In 2011, another access route was added when the Adirondack Land Trust bought the to the south, allowing the jeep road to the summit to be converted into a trail. It was longer, but less steep, than the existing trail. In 2013 another private organization's purchase added to the protected land around the mountain, when the Open Space Institute bought a conservation easement on to the north. The land, which extended all the way to Butternut Pond, is not on the mountain itself but within its northern viewshed. Geology The Adirondacks, geologically, are distinct from all other mountains in New York. While the Catskills, Taconics and other chains are in different ways part of the Appalachian Mountains, the northern mountains are a southerly extension of the Laurentian Mountains in the Canadian province of Qu√©bec. The Adirondack range is a large dome that uplifted and began to erode before being shaped further by geologically recent glacial epochs. It is often referred to as \\"new mountains from old rock\\" due to the pre-Cambrian nature of most of the rock and the relatively recent orogeny. Poke-O-Moonshine's massif is thus a miniature version of the range as a whole. Its bedrock is the same granite‚Äìgneiss combination as the rest of the range. The climbing cliffs feature subtypes of that rock like ferrodiorite and lamprophyre. There are some sheets of Potsdam Sandstone on the mountain, relics of a time before the orogeny when the land was beneath a shallow sea.Richard, slide 22. Natural environment The slopes of the mountain are covered in a northern hardwood forest similar to that found throughout the Adirondacks at lower elevations. The dominant species are sugar maple, birch and beech. There are a few oaks, a species not found much in the Adirondack forests, at lower elevations. Herbaceous plants in the understory include many fern species, and sarsaparilla. Higher up, where the slopes become rockier near and around the cliffs, other tree species, like white pine, striped maple and hemlock show up in the forest. Stinging nettles grow in the understory, along with red-flowering raspberry and wildflower species like trillium. On the summit ridge, the trees grow shorter and scrubbier. Mountain ash joins the forest. The summit's altitude is too low, even at its latitude, for the boreal forest found at higher elevations in the Adirondacks to flourish. The mountain's forest supports a diverse array of wildlife typical of the region. It is most notable for the peregrine falcons that nest in the cliffs. Since they are considered an endangered species in New York, DEC usually closes climbing routes that go near known nesting sites at the beginning of the climbing season in the springtime, sometimes till after midsummer, until all the falcons known to have hatched have successfully fledged. The department works closely with the climbing community on this, since the nesting falcons have been known to attack humans who come too close. Birders come to Poke-O- Moonshine during those times to watch the falcons, as well as the ravens that also nest there. Access Two trails lead to the summit of Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain. Both meet at the site of the observer's cabin on the south promontory below the upper cliffs; from there it is a short climb to the fire tower. The Upper Tiers lean-to is located a short distance away from their junction. =Ranger's Trail= From the south end of the old campground, the Ranger's Trail ascends under the cliff bases. First it traverses the slopes to the south, then attacks the slope more directly as it bends to the west. Unofficial side trails serving climbers go to the foot and, later, the tops of the cliffs. On a promontory roughly in elevation, it meets the Observer's Trail at the site where the cabin once stood. From there it turns north to the summit. For a long time the Ranger's Trail was the only public route to the top. The campground served as its trailhead, and thus it is still heavily used by climbers since it provides access to the base of the cliffs via unofficial side trails. It is only to the summit, but it climbs in that distance, giving much of the trail a steep grade averaging 35% . In addition to its steepness, it suffers from some of the same common problems as older Adirondack trails. It is heavily eroded in some areas; water runs along some stretches in spring and after significant rainfall. As part of the fire tower restoration, it was marked with 11 interpretive stations pointing hikers' attention to natural history in the surroundings, discussed in detail in a brochure available at the trailhead.Draft UMP, 48/ =Observer's Trail= The Adirondack Land Trust's 2008 purchase of south of the mountain allowed the former jeep road to be cleared and used as a trail. Two years later it was opened as the Observer's Trail. Its trailhead is almost a mile south of the Ranger's trailhead along Route 9, just past Cold Brook, over the Lewis town line. It is longer, at , and adds more vertical, requiring a climb to the summit. However, as a result, its grade is much gentler. It passes two beaver ponds on the way up to the junction with the Ranger's Trail. From its trailhead lot it crosses right over the brook, then heads west while ascending gently for a half-mile (1 km). At a ridgeline in elevation, it turns to the north. At first it follows the ridge, then descends slightly into the wetlands surrounding the beaver ponds, in the headwaters of the brook. It climbs again and then turns back east, where it meets the Ranger's Trail at the cabin ruin after a thousand feet (300 m). Summit alt=A wide landscape with a withered tree at the lower left, seen from a high point. Wooded mountains gradually decline to a wide body of water, across which another mountain range can be seen in the distance The summit of Poke-O-Moonshine is a small open area of rock. The firetower is located at its north, leaving a wide ledge. From it there is expansive view of the valley to the south of the mountain, with the Northway running through it. Further in that direction the Adirondack High Peaks stand out, with Giant and, further to the southwest, Whiteface mountain, distinguished by its prominent ski trails. Southeast the narrower south end of Lake Champlain is visible. From the firetower views open up in all directions. North of the mountain the Adirondacks yield to the plains and farmland of Clinton County and the lake opens up; Plattsburgh is visible, and in clear enough weather even Montr√©al, across the Canada‚ÄìUS border in Qu√©bec. East of Poke-O-Moonshine Burlington, Vermont, is visible across the lake, and beyond it the Green Mountains of that state. Climbing Poke-O-Moonshine is considered the Adirondacks' best climbing location. Its cliffs were first climbed by John Turner, an English immigrant to Canada, and a group of others from the Montr√©al area, during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Another group of regular climbers from Plattsburgh consolidated the work of Turner's group through the rest of the decade while trying to keep awareness of the mountain from being disseminated too widely, lest the cliffs become as busy on the weekends as those of the Shawangunk Ridge farther south and closer to New York City. By the mid-1970s, however, Poke-O-Moonshine had become known throughout the climbing community of the Northeast, yet without crowds developing.Mellor, 31. Today, on a busy weekend, the climbers are likely to be a mixture of Americans and French Canadians. The cliffs are divided into three main areas: the Main Wall across the north and east face of the mountain, easily visible when approaching from the north; the Slab, the rock face seen first when approaching from the south; and the Upper Tiers, the cliffs around the summit.Mellor, 213. Many of the routes available are highly challenging, with grades in the higher levels of the Yosemite Decimal System. Climbers with less skill than that required for such climbs are advised to avoid those routes or just hike up the mountain. Routes range from the 5.4 Snake at the easier endMellor, 231. to 5.13 Salad Days, a pitch described as \\"the hardest climbing yet done in the Adirondacks.\\"Mellor, 237. Both are on the Main Wall. Catharsis, a five-pitch 5.5 route on the Slab, has long been the mountain's most popular.Mellor, 223‚Äì224. On the Main Wall are other popular routes: Remembering Youth (5.12),Mellor, 233‚Äì234. the , five-pitch Gamesmanship (5.8) and Southern Hospitality (5.11)Mellor, 254‚Äì255. FM, another climber favorite rated 5.8 over five pitches and of the Main Wall, got its name during its first ascent when one of John Turner's associates screamed \\"Fuck me!\\" after a rock he stepped on broke loose.Mellor, 240‚Äì242. Positive Thinking, a 5.9 elsewhere on the wall, has become Poke-O-Moonshine's most popular ice route,Mellor, 250. despite a 2003 accident in which a Canadian climber fell to his death after the ice he was on detached.

It was launched by Bicycle Network in 2010, and aims to provide cyclists with one of the world‚Äôs toughest and most picturesque cycling challenges through Victoria‚Äôs Alpine region. Starting and finishing at Falls Creek, the 235 km route incorporates more than 4,400 vertical metres with three major climbs ‚Äì Tawonga Gap, Mount Hotham and Falls Creek. With climbs comparable to a stage in the Tour de France, riders must complete the circuit within 13 hours to receive a \\"Finisher‚Äôs Jersey\\". In 2013 a special jersey was introduced to recognise those cyclists who complete the event within 10 hours. The cycling challenge attracts cyclists from around the world including countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Hong Kong and New Zealand. The event seeks to create the unique, \\"European-style\\" cycling experience that riders could not undertake without Bicycle Network‚Äôs support; showcasing the region and furthering Bicycle Network‚Äôs mission of ‚Äúmore people cycling more often‚Äù. Event entry includes a controlled seeded wave start (descent down Falls Creek) with timed climbs, 85 km of road closures, mobile support teams ‚Äì lead vehicle, SAG wagon, motorcycle marshals, mechanical support, seven rest areas with food, medical and mechanical support, post-ride food and celebration, food and clothing valet service. Course profile The traditional route has little flat sections, with the majority of the ride either climbing or descending. The route starts at the top of Falls creek with a long descent to the valley floor of about 28 km. Immediately the first climb off Tawonga gap starts which is about 7 km long at an average gradient around 6%, rising just under 500 m from the start. Tawonga gap descends to Germantown at which point the main flat section of the route starts to Harrietville, a distance of 22 km rising no more than 200m along the length. At Harrietville the longest climb of the day starts to the top of Mount Hotham. This is a 30 km long climb broken into two 10 km steep sections averaging 6% gradient plus a flatter midsection at 2%. At the top of Mt Hotham a long descent to Omeo is started, which extends for some 50 km taking in Dinner plain along the way and a 4 km climb just before Omeo is reached. At Omeo a further 4 km climb is encountered along the road to the start of the climb to Falls Creek (known as \\"the back of Falls). The climb starts exactly on 200 km distance with the encounter of \\"WTF \\"corner\\", which is a 600 m section of road rising to 15% gradient. After this point is passed the rest of the climb for the next 9 km does not drop below 9% the whole way until Trapyard gap is reached. Here the road gets easier for the last 500 m vertical elevation to the summit, and the ride them is completed by a short descent into the township, around a mountain top reservoir. 2012 In 2012 960 people started the event, 93% completed inside the time limit 2013 In 2013 1300 started but only 83% finished. This year the route was changed due to the road to Mt Hotham subsiding as a consequence of bush fires and heavy rain. Instead the route was Tawonga gap, Mt Buffalo and the front of Falls Creek. The large number of people not finishing was mainly due to the extreme heat experienced in the day (in excess of 38 ¬∞C in the afternoon). 2014 In 2014 the event was sold out and 1781 riders started, 92% completing the ride inside the time limit. the course this year was the traditional route once more in ideal riding conditions. 2015 The event has been renamed to \\"Falls Creek Peaks Challenge\\", and is again sold out.  Awards  The event is recognised as Australia‚Äôs toughest single day cycling event, and in 2013 was named in Global Cycling Network‚Äôs Top 10 Best Sportives and Gran Fondos ‚Äì one of only two events in the list outside of Europe. In 2013, the ride was awarded as a finalist in the 'Adventure Tourism' category at the Victorian Tourism Awards.

Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, May 7, 2014. After high-ranking members of Saudi Arabia's religious establishment denounced the movement in general, and Saudi Grand Mufti and Permanent Committee head Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh's criticism of Rabee al-Madkhali specifically, the movement lost its support base within the wider Arab world. The remaining followers of Madkhali within Saudi Arabia tend to be foreign workers of Western origins, Saudis from Rabee al-Madkhali's hometown, and Kuwaitis and Yemenis.Jarret M. Brachman, Global Jihadism, pg. 30. Madkhali also retains a national network of disciples to promote his work and monitor the activities of competitor clerics, and although Madkhalists are outnumbered by followers of Society of the Revival of Islamic Heritage in Kuwait, they retain an extensive international network in the Middle East, Europe and Southeast Asia. Despite losing its audience in its country of origin, the movement had branched outward by the early 2010s, with Madkhalists gaining followers in western Kazakhstan, where the Government of Kazakhstan views them and other Islamists with suspicion.Almaz Rysaliev, \\"West Kazakhstan Under Growing Islamic Influence.\\" Institute for War and Peace Reporting. RCA Issue 653, 21 July 2011. Accessed 29 January 2013. Regardless of these gains, Western analysts have still described the movement as now being relegated to a primarily European phenomenon.Samir Amghar, \\"Salafism and Radicalisation of Young European Muslims.\\" Taken from European Islam: Challenges for Public Policy and Society, pg. 44.

September 4th, 2012. Another break between Madkhalists and the mainstream of purist Salafism has been the reaction to the Arab Spring. While most purist Salafists initially opposed both the Libyan Civil War and the Syrian Civil War, eventually they threw their support behind the opposition in both cases due to the extreme violence on the part of the Gaddafi and Assad regimes; the Madkhalists attacked the mainstream purists for these stances. As of early 2019, Madkhalists continue to be supported by the Saudi government and have found common cause with Libyan Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar during the Second Libyan Civil War. Tenets Madkhalism is often compared to Wahhabism, sharing a number of tenents with the wider movement. Media analysts have warned against generalizing such Islamists movements despite their differences, however. Madkhali has borrowed heavily from elder Salafist scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani; Madkhali adopted more extreme positions than Albani in his teaching, however, and Madkhalists were dismayed when Albani praised hardline clerics Safar Al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda. A cornerstone of Madkhalist discourse is unquestioning loyalty to governments, even those that use extreme and unjustified violence against their subjects. Unlike other Islamist groups which often oppose dictatorial government in the Middle East, the Madkhalist movement is openly supportive of such regimes.Martijn de Koning, pg. 171.Richard Gauvain, Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God, pg. 41. New York: Routledge, 2013.The Jamestown Foundation, Salafists Challenge al-Azhar for Ideological Supremacy in Egypt. 16 September 2010, Terrorism Monitor Volume: 8 Issue: 35 Madkhalists argue that the governments of Arab countries rule by divine right, otherwise God would not have allowed them to take power; anyone who opposes their view is labeled as a member of the Khawarij, an ancient Muslim sect. Relations with governments of countries which are Muslim but not Arab have not always been as smooth. Both Madkhali brothers actively encouraged Muslims inside and outside of Indonesia to join the armed Maluku sectarian conflict which continued from the late 1990s until the early 2000s.Noorhaidi Hasan, Laskar Jihad, pg. 151. Ithaca: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2006.Rohan Gunaratna, Inside Al Qaeda: global network of terror, pg. 201. Volume 3 of the University of St Andrews' Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence series. London: C. Hurst & Co., 2002. In the year 2000, Muhammad al-Madkhali went so far as to declare the prohibition of jihad by then Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, himself an internationally recognized Islamic scholar, as being contrary to sharia law.Robert W. Hefner, \\"Civil Pluralism Denied?\\" Taken from New Media in the Muslim World: The Emerging Public Sphere, pg. 170. Eds. Dale F. Eickelman and Jon W. Anderson. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003. Though often lumped together with all other Salafists and Islamists, the Madkhalists have been noted for their opposition to and mutual rivalry with Salafist jihadism. The Madkhalist movement has been described as politically quietist, eschewing the organized political efforts of the mainstream of Salafism and even going as far as to declare those who participate in modern political system to be heretics or even apostates.Martijn de Koning, pg. 169.George Joff√©, Islamist Radicalisation in Europe and the Middle East: Reassessing the Causes of Terrorism, pg. 317. London: I.B. Tauris, 2013. Such politically active Salafists are often described by followers of Madkhalism as part of an international conspiracy against \\"true Salafism.\\"Meijer, \\"Politicizing,\\" pg. 388. On the other hand, Western intelligence agencies have identified Madkhalists as a group which can be supported and funded discreetly by the US, in comparison to the rest of the groups seen under the wider Salafi movement.'U.S. could discretely fund mainstream Salafi figures like Madkhali ...' . Interaction with non-Muslim societies, where most Madkhalists reside, also distinguishes the movement. While most Salafists in the Western world are noted for lack of participation in the wider society, Madkhalists in particular are noted for minimizing contact with non-Muslims.Martijn de Koning, pg. 166. Also unlike the wider Islamist movement, Madkhalists seem uninterested in converting Western societies to Islam, preferring to simply accept and defend their rights as a minority community.Martijn de Koning, pg. 174. The polemics of the Madkhalists are markedly different from other Salafist groups as well. A noted feature of Madkhalism during Muslim dogmatic exchanges is attacking the opponent instead of discourse regarding the actual topic of discussion. The person of the movement's leader, Rabee al-Madkhali, also carries a heavy focus uncharacteristic of rival movements such as Qutbism. Madkhalists have been described as obsessed with defense of the movement's leader, often dramatising or exaggerating praise given by Salafist scholars and attempting to stifle or intimidate Salafists with opposing views to those of Madkhali and Madkhalists.Meijer, \\"Politicizing,\\" pg. 381. A common mantra promoted by Madkhali is that questioning the movement's clerics is forbidden as a general rule, and only allowed in cases of necessity.Roel Meijer, \\"The Problem of the Political in Islamist Movements.\\" Taken from Whatever Happened to the Islamists?: Salafis, Heavy Metal Muslims and the Lure of Consumerist Islam, pg. 49.

The conquest of Bengal by the Gupta dynasty led the ingress of the northern Indian culture into the ancient Bangladeshi culture which eventually introduced the tradition of theatre in Bangladesh. At present, apart from the Sanskrit theatre, the influence of the European theatre and the indigenous folk culture can also be seen in the theatre art of Bangladesh.  Sanskrit theatre  Through the conquest of Bengal by the Guptas, the culture of ancient Bangladesh assimilated the Aryan culture of the northern India and got heavily influenced by it. At that time, theatre activities, which was in form of Sanskrit theatre, was generally practised by the urban folks. The vigorous trade by the local people led to the rise of some urban areas which were home to the art and cultural centre of ancient Bangladesh. Lokananda is believed to be a popular play from this period which was structured in four acts with a prologue and was written by Chandragomin. The close political integration of many parts of ancient Bangladesh with the Aryan culture carried on through the 8th century. During this period, emperors like Bhaskaravarman, Yashovarman, Lalitaditya greatly influenced the Sanskrit theatre movement in the region. However, the theatre activities in this period witnessed the greatest patronage by Harshavardhana. According to the Kashmiri poet Kalhana, there was a great theatre dancer named Kamala in the ancient kingdom of Pundravardhana, now a part of northern Bangladesh. During the Pala rule (8th to 12th century), Bikrampur was the centre of a thriving Sanskrit theatre tradition in Bangladesh. This development of Sanskrit theatre also flourished during the Sena rule. The tradition of Sanskrit theatre witnessed a major impediment through the arrival of Muslim rule in the early 13th century. Few theatre activities are recorded from this period which were mostly supported by some Hindu feudal lords. Lakshmana Manikya of Bhulua was a great patron of Sanskrit theatre of this period.  Folk theatre  The term Folk theatre encompasses all forms of theatre which originated in the geographical region of Bangladesh. Unlike the Sanskrit theatre, the folk theatre was always in direct contact with the people and was often created and supported by them. However, it was not closed to the refined techniques of the Sanskrit theatre. In the folk theatre, the performers include actors, dancers, singers, musicians, and puppeteers (both male and female). Their performance is not restricted to dialogue in prose but is comprehensive and wide-ranging. It includes any one or more of the following elements: (i) dance, (ii) instrumental music and (iii) speech rendered in prose, verse or lyric, either in the form of narration or that of dialogue. The folk theatre of Bangladesh has developed in distinct forms, which can be loosely categorised into (i) the Narrative, (ii) the Song-and-Dance, (iii) the Processional, and (iv) the Supra-personae. = Narrative forms = In the narrative forms of theatre, the lead-narrator (gayen) describes an event, portrays various characters related to the event and enacts the action, all in the third person. While engaged as described above, s/he partly speaks his/her lines in prose, partly recites in verse, and partly sings his/her story. S/he is assisted by the choral singers- cum-musicians (dohars), who employ musical instruments (Mridanga and Mandira) and sing choral passages. The gayen carries a chamar (whisk) in religious performances and occasionally dances while singing. Usually, the performer makes effective use of vocal inflections and physical gestures in his/her portrayal of the characters. Sometimes s/he also readjusts his/her basic costume, and uses a few props to make the portrayal more effective. = Song- and-dance forms = A song-and-dance performance (nata-gita) is characterised by dances rendered by performers enacting characters while singing their lines or dancing silently to songs sung by a group of choral singers and musicians. = Supra-personae forms = The masked dance of the Gombhira festival was originally an ancient shamanist or spirit cult performance of the Koch community. By the 9th century, the Tantric Buddhism in Bangladesh assimilated the performance to evolve their own forms of masked dance, which were similar to Astamatrika Dance, Mahakali Pyayakhan, Devi Pyayakhan (Kathmandu, Nepal) and Tibetan Buddhist masked dances. These dances were performed in the Buddhist monasteries during religious festivals, very much as in Tibetan and Nepalese practice. These performances were given at the year-ending celebration of Chaitra Sangkranti and were given after processional performances. By the end of the 12th century, when Tantric Saivism in Bangladesh had assimilated decaying Tantric Buddhism, Buddhist masked dances were also adapted to give rise to Mahakali Pyayakhan, Devi Pyayakhan and similar dances. Tantric Saivite masked dances in Bangladesh, unlike those of Kathmandu Valley (Nepal), decayed because of Muslim conquest. What remains today can be seen in Mukho Nacha, Kali Kach, Gambhira festival and Sang Jatra. = Performance with scroll painting = The existence of patuya sangit (performances with scroll paintings) in ancient Bangladesh is confirmed by two sources: Yamapattika as referred to in Harshacharita (7th century AD) and scroll painting of the Santals. Banabhatta (the court-poet of Harsavardhan) in his Harshacharita briefly describes a popular performance of Yamapattaka witnessed by Harsavardhan on his way back to the capital after he learnt of the death of his brother. It was given by a performer with the help of a scroll-painting showing Yama, the King of the Underworld. On the other hand, recent ethnographic studies have shown that the Santal people have among them a type of scroll painting representing the origin of life (Ko Reyak Katha) and the passage of the dead from the mortal world to the life beyond (Chaksudan Pat). These too point to the ancient origin of Patuya Gan performances in Bangladesh. In the medieval period, scroll painting performances eulogising Ramachandra, Krishna, Manasa, Chandi were extremely popular. By the 18th century, scroll-painting performances gained popularity even among the Muslims, as evinced by Gazir Pat (scroll-painting performances eulogising Pir Gazi), which can still be seen in Bangladesh today. = Puppet theatre = It is not known when puppet theatre was introduced in Bangladesh. The earliest extant literary evidence of the existence of the form in Bangladesh is a couplet in Yusuf Zulekha (1391‚Äì1410). As signified there, these performances were given with the help of string puppets. It is possible that orally composed tales of gods and goddesses, such as those of Krishna, Rama, Manasa etc., were produced in these performances. Mukunda Chakravarti's Chandimangal (1555‚Äì56) and Krishnadasa Kaviraja's Chaitanya Charitamrita (c 1560‚Äì80) definitely point to the existence of puppet theatre during this period. Judging by the popularity of cults and the existing tradition among current performers, it could be safely assumed that these were related to Krishna, Rama, Manasa, Chandi and Chaitanya. No Islamic narrative ever seems to have been performed by puppets in Bangladesh. String puppets still exist in Bangladesh today. = Processional Forms = Processional performances are characterised by the use of tableaux, music, song and dance, all of which form a part of large processions (jatra) attended by adherents of a particular religious faith. In many ways, these performances hold the key to the history of indigenous theatre because they brought together all the three types discussed above, to give birth to jatra, the most popular form of the indigenous theatre which can claim to be indeed the national theatre idiom.  European influence  Political and economic measures undertaken by the English colonisers from 1757 onwards led to the Bengali Renaissance in the early 19th century, which affected all aspects of intellectual pursuits in Bangladesh. Its immediate effect was a bifurcation of society into the rural and urban cultures. The elitist urban culture and the European theatre of the economically powerful minority fashioned itself around European models. It demonstrated tremendous vitality, opened new directions, but, as in most cases, also lost touch with the majority and their rural culture. The indigenous theatre, which in most cases remained a part of the rural culture, has failed to meet the demands of the 21st century life in Bangladesh and a process of fossilisation has already set in. On the other hand, the European theatre has been dynamic because the elite urban intelligentsia, who have been responding to the needs of urban spectators, have sustained it. Inception of the European theatre in Bangladesh or erstwhile East Bengal took place in 1855 with a performance of Svarna Sharnkhal by Durgadas Kar at Barisal.  Theatre during East Pakistan period  Until 1947, the theatre of the urban elite in Bengal was centred in Calcutta, the economic and political seat of power of 19th century India. With the creation of Pakistan, Dhaka gained importance as the urban cultural centre of eastern Bengal which later turned into East Pakistan. The theatre of the new country was slowly but decisively moving towards polarisation of two opposing camps: (i) the religion-based nationalists and (ii) the language-based nationalists. The religion-based trend was dominant in the urban areas outside Dhaka. It sought to glorify Islamic history through historical plays on Muslim rulers of the Middle East, India and Bengal, and the independence struggle of Pakistan. Akbaruddin, Ibrahim Khan and Ibrahim Khalil are some of the most prominent playwrights of this trend. The second trend was dominant mainly in Dhaka city and playwrights belonging to this trend were also linked with Dhaka University-based play productions. This trend was pioneered by Natyaguru Nurul Momen. He wrote, published, directed, enacted, broadcast and staged the earliest couple of plays which were secular, non-communal, progressive and international in their themes and plots. The Natyaguru, Nurul Momen's first play 'Rupantor'(Transformation) was a 1942 play which propounded the cause of women's lib and empowerment at a time when even the western world wasn't vocal enough about equal rights for women. Some other important playwrights who followed Natyaguru Nurul Momen in this trend include Shawkat Osman, Askar Ibne Shaikh, Jasimuddin and Munier Chowdhury.  Theatre in post independence period  Theatre was possibly the most forceful and exuberant expression of post-liberation Bangladesh. Numerous non-professional theatre groups were formed all over the country, modelled after the group theatre movement in post-Nabanna Calcutta. The most important among these in Dhaka city were Theatre (established February 1972), Nagarik Natya Sampraday (established 1968, first performance August 1972), Natyachakra (established August 1972), Aranyak Natyadal (established 1972), Dhaka Theatre (established July 1973) and, in Chittagong, Theatre '73 (established 1973), ‚Äò‚ÄôTirjak Nattyagoshthi‚Äô‚Äô (Established May 1974) and Arindam (established September 1974). The range of texts performed by the groups varied widely, from Euro-American plays to contemporary originals written by group members themselves. A completely new set of playwrights appeared, important among whom were Abdullah al Mamun, Mamunur Rashid, Syed Shamsul Huq, Selim Al Deen, Mumtazuddin Ahmed, Rabiul Alam, S M Solaiman, Abdullahel Mahmud, Mannan Heera, Malay Bhowmick, Azad Abul Kalam and Saymon Zakaria. The first-ever Bangladesh International Theatre Festival was held at Dhaka‚Äôs Shilpakala Academy in June 2019, featuring a host of local works, along with plays from six other countries.  Significance  The culture of theatre has great significance in the history as well as the daily lives of Bangladeshis. The theatre performances had vehemently inspired the independence movements during the British rule in Bangladesh. It also had great impact in the Bengali language movement. The language-based nationalists during the East Pakistan period played an important role in this regard. Kabar written by Munier Chowdhury is a famous play based on the language movement. The theatre performances also significantly influenced the independence struggle of Bangladesh. At present, many NGOs use theatre as a forceful medium to create awareness for many social issues in the rural areas of Bangladesh.

He served during the First and Second World Wars, and was Chief of the General Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces from 1946 to 1949. Early life Weir was born in the Heathcote Valley, near Christchurch. His father, a fireman, was an Irish immigrant while his mother was originally from Christchurch. From an early age, Weir had ambitions of a career in the military. After completing his education at Christchurch West District High School, he was of the first ten cadets from New Zealand to enter the Royal Military College at Duntroon, Australia, in 1911. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Weir volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) without having completed his course at Duntroon. He embarked with the main body of the NZEF on 16 October 1914. A lieutenant in the Auckland Infantry Battalion, he participated in the Gallipoli Campaign and was wounded during the Second Battle of Krithia on 8 May 1915.Stowers, 2005, p. 73 He was later repatriated to New Zealand.McGibbon, 2000, pp. 597‚Äì598 Interwar period After recovering from his wounds, Weir joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. He served in a number of staff positions for the next several years. In 1930, he was named commander of a military police contingent that was raised for service in Western Samoa but was ultimately not required. He later served as a staff officer at Central Command and at defence headquarters. In 1937 he was a colonel and was part of the New Zealand contingent sent to London for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was later aide-de-camp to New Zealand's governor general. Second World War Weir was a lieutenant colonel and in command of the Northern Military District when the Second World War began. He was promoted to colonel and then brigadier in 1940 and commanded the Central Military District. When the 4th Division, one of three intended for home defence, was raised in April 1942 he was made its commander and promoted to temporary major general. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the same year.Cooke & Crawford, 2011, p. 272 In December 1942, Weir was posted to the headquarters of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) in Egypt. He was responsible for the administrative needs of the 2NZEF. In January 1943, while on a visit to the 2nd New Zealand Division which was positioned on the outskirts of Tripoli, Weir, together with Brigadier William Gentry and Major General Bernard Freyberg, were ambushed and came under fire from Italian and German troops. Freyberg escaped and organised a party from a machine gun company to retrieve the brigadiers, but both had managed to evade capture by the time of its arrival. On linking up with the retrieval party, Weir stated he was \\"... too old for this, I'm too old for this.\\"Kay, 1958, pp. 315‚Äì316 From November 1943, Weir served as commander of New Zealand forces in Egypt. In 1945 he returned to New Zealand as Quartermaster General of the military. For his service with the 2NZEF he was mentioned in despatches. Later life In January 1946 Weir succeeded Lieutenant General Edward Puttick as Chief of the General Staff, New Zealand Military Forces. His temporary rank of major general was made substantive, and he was awarded the United States Legion of Merit. In his new role, he had to oversee the demobilisation of 2NZEF and contend with a military transitioning from a wartime footing to peacetime soldiering. As the threat of the Cold War increased, he favoured the reintroduction of compulsory military training and the reconstitution of the Territorial Force as part of an overall commitment to send forces to the Middle East in the event of war with Russia. He retired from the military in September 1949, having been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1948 King's Birthday Honours. Weir spent his later years in Cambridge. He died in Hamilton on 11 July 1961, survived by his wife and daughter. After a funeral service in Cambridge, he was buried at the nearby Hautapu Cemetery.

Benson enlisted in the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade of the Australian Imperial Force in September 1914 and saw active duty in the Mediterranean. He took sketches of the landscape prior to the allied invasion at Gallipoli. Benson was commissioned as an Australian official war artists in April 1918, and after the end of the war worked at the Australian War Records Section in London. A scrapbook of 140 sketches drawn by Benson during his time in the First World War are now held by the Australian War Memorial. He designed the commemorative vignette for the first airmail envelopes carried from England to Australia by Keith and Ross Smith in 1919. In 1931, Benson was commissioned by the University of Western Australia to paint the ceiling beams of Winthrop Hall. He carried out further mural commissions in Perth, while also working as a critic and cartoonist for The West Australian newspaper. Benson applied for a second commission with the Australian War Memorial at the beginning of the Second World War, but was declined due to his age (he was in his 50s at the time). Benson instead enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces and worked as a camouflage officer until 1943. Benson was a long-standing member of the Melbourne Savage Club from 1913 to 1936. Benson moved to Perth in 1931 and died there in 1960.

Crime in Austria is combated by a range of Austrian law enforcement agencies.  Crime by type  = Murder = In 2017, Austria (with a population of about 8.795 million) had an intentional homicide rate of 0.61 per 100,000 population - one of the lowest rates in the world.

In 2004 Austria had the lowest rates of car theft in the EU. = Corruption = Austria has a well-developed institutional and legal system, and most corruption cases under investigation by a parliamentary committee end with judicial trials and effective judgments. Several significant Austrian corruption cases took place during the 2000s involving land and regional officials, high-level public officials, the central government and, in one instance, the former Chancellor. In most cases, corrupt practices were related to conflicts of interest, abuse of office, money laundering and influence peddling. The corruption scandals have put into doubt the ethical standards of the political elite. This doubt is reflected in the findings of Eurobarometer 2012, where two-thirds of respondents perceive national politicians to be corrupt and also the most corrupt institution in Austria.  Crime dynamics  Austria is targeted by foreign criminals, with 64 percent of drug-related offences being carried out by criminals who are born abroad. According to British criminal Colin Blaney in his autobiography Undesirables, British thieves and confidence tricksters have targeted Austria on account of the fact that it is viewed as a soft touch due to its relatively low crime rates.  By location  Most criminal activity is focused in the larger metropolitan areas. \\"Austria 2012 Crime and Safety Report\\", United States Department of State, Overseas Security Advisory Council, 13 March 2012.

The two schools are located 35 miles apart from each other on I-20 in North Louisiana. The two teams have met 43 times on the football field, with Louisiana Tech currently holding a 29‚Äì14 lead in the all-time series. The game ended in 2000, following the Bulldogs' transition to the Western Athletic Conference. This rivalry will restart November 21, 2020. History The matchup began in 1953 as a conference game, following Northeast Louisiana State's move to the Gulf States Conference. After the Gulf States Conference dissolved at the end of the 1970 football season, Louisiana Tech joined the Southland Conference, while Northeast Louisiana remained a football independent school, and the yearly game continued as a non-conference matchup. The game once again became a conference matchup in 1982, when Northeast Louisiana joined the Southland Conference, before once again moving to a non-conference game following Louisiana Tech's departure from the Southland following the 1986 season. The early history of the series was dominated by Louisiana Tech, as the Bulldogs won 20 of the first 25 meetings between the two schools. Following the end of the 1978 season, long-time Louisiana Tech head coach Maxie Lambright resigned, and Tech decided to hire Arkansas assistant coach Larry Beightol as their new head coach, instead of promoting long-time Lambright assistant coach (and Louisiana Tech alum), Pat Collins. Collins was subsequently hired as an assistant coach at Northeast Louisiana, before being promoted to head coach following John David Crow's resignation at the end of the 1980 season. Prior to Collins' first game against Tech as a head coach, he drew the ire of Tech fans by using insider information gleaned during his time as a Tech assistant to complain to Southland Conference officials and have the Bulldogs' star linebacker, Ed Jackson, declared ineligible to play. The game, dubbed the \\"Ed Jackson Bowl,\\" quickly turned into a rout, as Northeast Louisiana dominated the Bulldogs en route to a 35‚Äì0 victory in front of 23,500 fans at Tech's Joe Aillet Stadium. Collins spent eight seasons as coach at Northeast Louisiana and went 6‚Äì2 all time against his alma mater. Following Collins' tenure, however, Louisiana Tech once again began to dominate the matchup, winning 7 of the last 8 meetings, with a 1989 game that the Bulldogs initially won on the field, but later forfeited the victory, as the only blemish. In 2000, the matchup came to an end, with a 42‚Äì19 Tech victory in Monroe. Following the 2000 season, Louisiana Tech became a member of the Western Athletic Conference, while Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe became a member of the Sun Belt Conference in 2001. Since then, both teams have played in different conferences, and the game has not been scheduled. In 2013, Louisiana Tech left the WAC and joined Conference USA. 2012‚Äì2013 Bowl Season Following the 2012 season, Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe was invited to play in the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, LA. Louisiana Tech was also invited to play in the game but instead chose to let the Independence Bowl's time deadline pass in hopes of an offer from another bowl that never materialized. The Bulldogs did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense. Several members of the media have speculated that Louisiana Tech's reluctance to play in the Independence Bowl may have been based on their reluctance to renew their rivalry with ULM, though Tech officials have denied that this was their motivation in seeking a different bowl game. Attempted renewal In the summer of 2013, at his inaugural press conference, Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe's new athletic director, Brian Wickstrom, announced his intention to play Louisiana Tech in football every year. In a press conference with a local newspaper, Dr. Les Guice, Louisiana Tech's president, indicated that an offer would not be heavily considered, as the future out-of-conference schedule was full. Louisiana Tech's new athletic director Tommy McClelland confirmed that Tech would not pursue any games with Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe, as they are \\"grow[ing] a national brand\\" and that playing Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe could not help Louisiana Tech accomplish that goal. In 2020, the rivalry is expected to be renewed amid a slew of cancelled games due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Plot The film stars Finnish actor Pertti Koivula in the lead role as Tenho, a prodigal son with patent leather shoes and dancing skills to match, who returns home to his family's rural farm for the summer after failing to make a living in the city. Tenho's brother Aarne (Taisto Reimaluoto) runs the farm while Grandma (\\"Mummo\\") (Anja Pohjola), the boys' mother, as the matriarch, tends to farm chores while caring for her boys' father (Veikko Tiitinen) in his failing physical and mental health. Other characters include Tenho's young nephew Tapi and Tenho's sister-in-law Tuija. Tenho is immediately put to work on the farm by his brother, but Tenho is not cut out for farm life. He cannot keep up with the work even when he tries, and he does everything possible to get out of helping, even deliberately maiming himself. Highlights of the film include Tenho's budding romance with the attractive milk maid Virva; it looks like a sure thing until Virva learns about a certain bet involving her that Tenho has made with Aarne. That's when Virva turns to ice and Tenho's feelings change to crazed obsession. The film also features live performances by Finnish tango musician Reijo Taipale.

All 16 passengers and 5 crew on board were killed. The following investigation determined that the aircraft had descended abruptly after pitching nose-down, but was unable to establish the cause of the sudden manoeuvre.  Aircraft and crew  UP-CJ006, the aircraft involved in the crash, at Almaty Airport three weeks before the accident The aircraft was a 12-year-old Bombardier CRJ-200 (registration UP-CJ006) which began flying in 2000 for Cimber Air with registrations OY-RJA. Nine years later the aircraft was transferred to Cimber Sterling. Following Ciber Sterling's bankruptcy in 2012, SCAT Airlines purchased the aircraft, where it was re-registered as UP- CJ006. The aircraft was powered by two General Electric CF34-3B1 turbofan engines. The captain was 55-year-old Vladimir Nikolaevich Evdokimov, who had been working with SCAT airlines since 2001 and had logged 18, 194 flight hours, including 1,227 hours on the CRJ-200. The first officer was 43-year-old Alexander Vladimirovich Sharapov, who had been with the airline since 2006 and had 3,507 flight hours, with 132 of them on the CRJ-200. Accident The airliner operating the flight was on final approach to Almaty International Airport in thick fog when it crashed short of the runway near the village of Kyzyltu at 13:13 local time (07:13 UTC), 14 seconds after initiating a go- around. All 16 passengers and 5 crew members aboard were killed. Investigation Shortly after the accident, a commission headed by Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the First Deputy Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, was set up by Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov to investigate the cause of the crash. Maulen Mukashev, the deputy mayor of Almaty, visited the crash site and told reporters that the preliminary cause of the crash was bad weather. Mukashev also added: \\"Not a single part of the plane was left intact after it came down.\\" On 2 March 2015, the Interstate Aviation Committee released their final report stating that during the missed approach procedure, initiated due to weather conditions being below minimal, a nose-down elevator deflection was recorded, resulting in a steep dive and impact with the ground. The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the elevator deflection but did not find evidence of any system malfunction or external factors.

Life and career Binks was recognised as the leading artist of his day in canine portraiture, not only in the UK but abroad. He painted dogs for three generations of the British Royal family, and among his patrons were four successive monarchs. He spent many months in the Punjab, painting for an Indian potentate, the Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, the ruling Maharaja of the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938) and he paid several visits to the USA to fulfil commissions for prominent American families, including Geraldine R. Dodge, niece of the famous millionaire, John D. Rockefeller. Starting as a miniaturist, he painted some exquisite examples of that art, but had to give it up owing to the strain on his eyes and took to painting sporting subjects. A great lover of dogs, they featured in many of his pictures and it was soon apparent that he had a distinct flair in that direction. He used a variety of media ‚Äì drypoint, etching, aquatint, pastel and watercolour ‚Äì and, as his skill developed, so did his reputation. His talent attracting Royal notice, Binks was commissioned to paint the famous terrier, ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù Caesar (dog), for King Edward VII and some of the favourite dogs of Queen Alexandra. He also painted Clumber spaniels for King George V, Cairns for King Edward VIII (then Prince of Wales), retrievers for King George VI (then the Duke of York), terriers for the Duke of Gloucester (then Prince Henry), Alsatians for the late Duke of Kent (then Prince George), and the pets of Princess Victoria (sister of King George V). During the reign of King George V, Binks was frequently asked to attend the Royal shoots at Sandringham in order to sketch the sporting dogs at work. Among his most treasured possessions was a signed portrait of His Majesty given to him by the King in 1929, framed in red morocco and bearing the Royal crown in gilt. In 1925, Binks went to India to paint 150 pictures of dogs for the Maharajah of Patiala. Much of his work appeared in such UK publications as the weekly newspaper, The Sketch, Field magazine, Country Life magazine and Bystander magazine.

They finished as the runners-up of the A-Division in 2003, but have spent most of their history either in mid-table in the A-Division or playing in the B-Division. History The first recorded instance of Dzongree participating in the A-Division was in 2003, where they finished as runners-up to eventual winners Druk Pol, who finished the season unbeaten. The only known result for Dzongric for this season is a 5‚Äì2 victory over Druk United. Their next recorded involvement, since only the top four teams for 2004 are known, in the A-Division was in 2005, where they finished bottom. During this season, they won only two games and lost all the remaining fixtures out of the total of 12 played. Sources indicate that Dzongree and the team who finished second from bottom, Rigzung Club, entered into a relegation play-off with the top two teams from that season's B-Division, who were Choden and Rookies F.C. However details of any matches that took place are not available. Details for the 2006 season are very scant, so it is not possible to say whether Dzongree survived the relegation playoff the previous season, however, they definitely did not compete in the A-Division in 2007, nor were they involved in the promotion / relegation playoffs at the end of the season from the B-Division. In fact available sources indicate that they do not appear to have competed again in the A-Division at least until 2012. This season was mediocre as far as Dzongree were concerned, winning only three of their ten games and losing all of the others, where they finished fourth and failed to qualify for the inaugural Bhutan National League. The following season saw a slight improvement. Despite only winning three games and drawing one of their eight matches in the A-Division, their performance was sufficient to see them into third place out of five teams and to qualify for the National League for the first time. However, they struggled in the National League winning only two and drawing one of their ten games and finishing second to last in fifth place, only Phuentsholing below them. It was during this season that Dzongree signed a foreign player to play for their team. The Nigerian, Chichi, joined the club on an exchange program with a Nigerian football academy, a rarity within Bhutanese football, particularly given the stringent Bhutanese immigration laws that meant obtaining a visa for any foreign player was very difficult. Chichi scored in every game in which he played and was said to have been instrumental in securing National League football for Dzongree. 2014 was also a disappointing season for the club, which saw them miss out on National League qualification, the team finishing fifth out of seven teams. They won only three games, drawing another three along the way and scored only twelve goals in all ten matches, the lowest total out of all the competing teams.

Iglesia-Quinchao History The church site was established in 1605 and referred to before 1767. In 1906 the exterior corridors of the Church were eliminated. In the 1960s an area in the rear was eliminated. Restoration of the Church was carried out in 1993. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2000. Reconstruction The Church had deteriorated to such an extent that it was closed in 2006. No one could enter for fear it would totally collapse. It was the first among the churches of Chilo√© to be completely restored. The restoration included putting in a concrete foundation. Beams of coig√ºe wood and a new structural framework for the wooden floor were installed. More than 80% of the structurally significant wood had to be changed, but 95% of the extant wood was reused. 90,000 larch shingles were installed. In its previous incarnations, the Church was made principally from coig√ºe, ulm, and cypress woods. Restored, there is much more larch and ma√±√≠o wood.

It was directed by Antonio Margheriti and starred Richard Harrison and Wandisa Guida. The film involves a handpicked group of expert soldiers infiltrate the enemy's stronghold to locate and destroy a secret weapon prior to the Battle of Alesia. The film is a co-production between Italy's Devon Film and N.C. and France's Radius Productions. Ralph Hudson's only other credited film role was the lead in Tarzak contro gli uomini leopardo/Ape Man of the Jungle also released in 1964. Plot In 52 B.C. Julius Caesar is planning to conquer Vercingetorix and Gaul. Prior to the invasion Caesar orders the four \\"bravest and strongest soldiers in the army\\" to be sent on an undercover reconnaissance and raiding mission to locate and destroy an unknown but feared secret weapon of the Druids in three days time as Caesar will attack on the dawn of the fourth day. Centurion Claudius Marcellus leads three other men, Germanicus the strong man, Varus an expert knife thrower and Castor an experienced and highly competent soldier. The party infiltrates the enemy's lines through the sacrifice of their escort party who launch a suicidal attack on the Druids to attract their attention away from Marcellus' party. Joining the four commandoes is young Valerius; a boy who ran away from a wealthy Roman home to become a Legionary but only became a Gunga Din type labourer. The party is captured where they are placed next to Livilla, a captured Roman patrician noblewoman and her last surviving member of her Roman Army escort Drusus who has lost his courage and military discipline through constant torture. Called before Vercingetorix, Claudius Marcellus the leader of the group is threatened with torture by heated iron bars but he astounds Vercingetorix by grabbing a hot piece of iron and laying it on his own chest telling the Grand Druid not to waste his time. Taken back to his cell as Vercingetorix schemes better torture, strongman Germanicus is able to bend the bars of the cell so the party can enter the adjoining cell of Livilla and Drusus that makes an escape possible. Though the Romans now number seven, nearly half their party are not competent soldiers. Livilla and Valerius have no experience whatsoever, and Drusus is an unknown asset; he has lost all desire to be a Roman soldier and only wishes to return home rather than participate in a suicide mission but during their escape he proves himself highly proficient with a captured bow and quiver of arrows against the enemy. The group faces further tribulations when Valerius is captured and tortured by the enemy to reveal the mission, location and composition of the party as well as the plans of the main body of Caesar's troops. The Roman party attacks a group of Druids and are burdened with two prisoners; one is a woman who Castor falls in love with. On the early morning of the day of Caesar's attack, the Romans discovers the secret weapon guarding the mountain pass where Caesar's forces will come through. The weapon is a catapult that fires flaming pitch into the attack force igniting the terrain and the attacking soldiers.

The original portion of the district was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1973 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978; additions to the district were nationally listed in 1989. Extent The Ypsilanti Historic District covers most of the older commercial sections of the city, as well as surrounding residential areas. The original, and largest, portion of the district extends roughly between Grove Street on the east, Hamilton Street on the west, Forest Avenue on the north, and Buffalo Street south. Three sections were added to the NRHP district in 1989: a northeast addition running along Forest, Oak, and Maple Streets extending east to Prospect Street, a southern addition running along South Adams between Ferris and Catherine Streets, and a western addition roughly extending the district west to Summit Street between Forest Street and Michigan Avenue. The district is the third largest historic district in the state. History The city of Ypsilanti was founded in 1823, and became an important railroad stop when the line was built through the city in 1838. As Ypsilanti grew, a commercial district sprang up on the Detroit-Chicago Road (now Michigan Avenue). In the late 1840s, a second commercial district (now known as Depot Town) grew up a few blocks to the northeast, near the railroad depot. In 1851, a substantial fire destroyed a sizable portion of the Michigan Avenue business district. The structures were quickly rebuilt, and many of the 1850s buildings still exist in the heart of the historic district. Description The core of the Ypsilanti Historic District contains approximately 400 contributing structures in two main areas. These are the commercial cores along Michigan Avenue and near the railroad depot on Cross Street (Depot Town). Huron Street, paralleling the river, links the two areas, and the structures around Huron Street are primarily residential in character. The residential structures include multiple examples of vernacular Greek Revival, Queen Anne, and brick Italianate houses. The commercial structures are substantially original two- and three-story brick structures. The northeast addition is residential in character, containing primarily frame Greek Revival, Queen Anne, and Tudor Revival houses constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The addition has 63 contributing structures, including both modest single family residences and grander homes that once housed elite citizens of the community. The south addition contains another 12 contributing residential structures, for the most part modest frame houses. The western addition to the district includes a little over 300 contributing structures, most of them single family homes. Many of these have been converted to apartments or fraternity houses due to the proximity of Eastern Michigan University.

History Nangpa's first recorded season in the top flight of Bhutanese football was in the 2010 season, having been promoted from the B-Division at the end of the previous season. They struggled in their first season in the A-Division, picking up only a solitary point in a draw against Druk Athletic.

The following season was equally unsuccessful for the club. Although there appears to have been no relegation from the A-Division at the end of the previous year, and although few details are available, it is known that Nangpa again finished bottom. 2012 was Nangpa's final season to date in the A-Division. Again they finished bottom of the league, although they were able to pick up their first ever top-flight victory in a 2‚Äì1 win against Dzongree.
