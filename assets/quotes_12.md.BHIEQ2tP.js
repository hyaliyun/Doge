Education Torroja was born in Madrid where he studied civil engineering. Career Ingeniero Torroja Market, Algeciras In 1923 Torroja began work for the Hidrocivil company, headed by the engineer Jos√© Eugenio Ribera. He planned and directed various types of projects, including the foundations of bridge piers, bridges, water supply and sanitation works, and various urban buildings. Torroja's first large project was the Tempul cable-stayed aqueduct (1926) in Guadalete, Jerez de la Frontera, in which he used pre-stressed girders. In 1928 he established his own office. Modesto L√≥pez Otero, director for the Madrid University City (Ciudad Universitaria de Madrid) project, formed a diverse team of young architects to design the various buildings. Torroja joined the group in 1929. He worked with Manuel S√°nchez Arcas, sharing his interest in new architectural forms that rejected preconceived formulas. The first collaborative work of Torroja and Sanchez Arcas was the pavilion of the Construction Commission of the university city, completed in June 1931. They worked on the heating plant (Central T√©rmica) and the clinical hospital for the university city. S√°nchez Arcas and Torroja designed an enclosed and semi-spherical shell for the 1932 Algeciras market hall. The thick concrete roof was high, vaulted, supported on eight pillars. As an engineering work it is considered Torroja's masterpiece. S√°nchez Arcas and Torroja founded the journal Hormig√≥n y Acero (Concrete and Steel). In 1934 they founded the Instituto T√©cnico de la Construcci√≥n y Edificaci√≥n (ITCE, Technical Institute of Construction and Building). Other founding members were the architect Modesto L√≥pez Otero (1885‚Äì1962) and the engineers Jos√© Mar√≠a Aguirre Gonzalo (1897‚Äì1988) and Alfonso Pe√±a Boeuf (1888‚Äì1966). The ITCE was a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and applying technical innovations in engineering civil structures. In 1952, Eduardo Torroja ‚Äì along with Andr√© Balency-B√©ran, Emile Nenning, Louis Baes, Hubert H√ºsch and Georg W√§stlund ‚Äì founded the Comit√© Europ√©en du B√©ton, which is now the F√©d√©ration Internationale du B√©ton. The Comit√© Europ√©en du B√©ton sought to coordinate the research effort on structural concrete in Europe following the end of the Second World War. La Zarzuela Racetrack, Madrid, Spain Eduardo Torroja designed the thin-shell water tower in Fedalawater tower in Fedala and the roof of the \\"La Zarzuela\\" racetrack in Madridhippodrome \\"Zarzuela\\" in the form of a hyperboloid. He also used steel with great √©lan, as at the roof of the Football Stadium, Barcelona (1943). He designed innovative structures in numerous parts of the world, including Morocco and Latin America. His books include Philosophy of Structures (1958) and The Structures of Eduardo Torroja (1958).  Personal characteristics  Torroja believed that a structure should reflect the personality of its designer. Some believe every specific twist and turn in a structure reflects an important event in one‚Äôs life. Believing in the latter, Torroja developed new ways of looking at structures as well as ways to increase the strength of the structures without dimming aesthetics. Torroja illustrated an interest in forms of art that dwindled within most of his structures which often incorporated his visions. Socioeconomic and political environment In the 1920s, Europe was left in ruins to struggle with economic and political recovery. Since Spain was short on steel supplies, Torroja had to pursue other materials. In his search for new materials, Torroja became famous for his exploration of alternative uses for horse manure, which was found to be a strong and cheap in-cost material. Today, Torroja is renowned for his development of reinforced concrete.

He is perhaps known best as the editor who championed the publication of Frank Herbert‚Äôs bestselling novel Dune. Life Lanier was born on December 18, 1927 in New York City to Priscilla Thorne Taylor and Berwick Bruce Lanier. He was trained as an anthropologist and archaeologist, and educated at Harvard, from which he graduated during 1951. He was a lifelong devotee of speculative fiction, as well as a cryptozoology enthusiast. Before beginning his literary career Lanier worked as a research historian at the Winterthur Museum from 1958 to 1960. He died in Sarasota, Florida, at the age of 79. Literary career Lanier's career as an author and editor began during 1961, when his first short story was published and he became an editor for Chilton Books. He was with Chilton in 1965, when he was instrumental in persuading the firm to publish Frank Herbert‚Äôs Dune. Having read Dune World in Analog magazine, he was responsible for tracking down the author and conveying Chilton's offer. More than twenty other publishing companies had already turned the book down. Despite Lanier's brilliant insight on the worth of the book, he was dismissed from Chilton a year later because of high publication costs and poor initial book sales. Lanier also worked as an editor for the John C. Winston Company and McRae-Smith. The most prominent of Lanier's own writings are his stories of the crypto-adventurer Brigadier Donald Ffellowes (told in the \\"club story\\" style of Lord Dunsany's Jorkens tales), and the post-apocalyptic novels Hiero's Journey (1973) and The Unforsaken Hiero (1983). His short story \\"A Father's Tale\\" (1974) was a World Fantasy Award nominee. His major works including Hiero's Journey, The Unforsaken Hiero, and the Brigadier Ffellowes stories are now available in an electronic version for Kindle. Sculpture Lanier‚Äôs sculptures have been exhibited at a number of museums, including the Smithsonian Institution. He specialized in miniatures, among which were a series featuring characters from J. R. R. Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings . One set was given to Tolkien himself, with whom Lanier corresponded. Tolkien reportedly admired the miniatures but did not want them to be marketed commercially, a wish Lanier respected.

It was a big hit in Europe, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The single was part of a bigger \\"A Teenage Opera\\" project. The song was written by Wirtz and West, credited as \\"Philwit / Hopkins\\". History According to Mark Wirtz, the song comes from a dream he had about an ageing door-to-door grocer named Jack in a small, turn of the 20th century village, who was mocked by the children as he was taken for granted by the town folk. When Jack unexpectedly died, the town folk reacted with anger about the inconvenience of now having to be self-reliant about their staple provision, while the children were heartbroken, in truth having loved and appreciated Jack all the while. Working with EMI recording engineer Geoff Emerick at Abbey Road Studios on a project called Mood Mosaic, Wirtz developed the idea which he called \\"Excerpt from A Teenage Opera\\" because, he said: \\"That way, if the single is a hit, people will want an entire LP of the whole opera\\". The recording used the voices of children from the Corona Academy, with Keith West of the band Tomorrow, with whom Wirtz was also working, as lead vocalist, and his bandmate Steve Howe on guitar. At first, EMI executives were critical of the use of children's voices on a supposedly \\"rock\\" record, but Wirtz played an acetate of the record to Radio Caroline DJ John Peel, who loved it and played it on his show. After its eventual release, it climbed the UK singles chart, reaching number 2 in September 1967 (behind \\"The Last Waltz\\" by Engelbert Humperdinck). Official UK Singles Chart, 20-27 September 1967. Retrieved 9 August 2020 The single reached number one in 16 countries, but in the US only reached number 109. Keith West Top Songs, MusicVf. Retrieved 9 August 2020 According to Wirtz, EMI treated the single as a one-off novelty, and refused to give the go-ahead for a full album until there had been a second hit single. Wirtz turned down an offer from Robert Stigwood to help develop the project. He continued to work on the project, which he intended to be \\"a kaleidoscope of stories, a bouquet of allegorical, tragiccomic tales about a variety of characters and their fate, all related to each other by the common thread of living in the same imaginary turn-of the-century village. Each character distinguished him/herself by rebelliously pursuing a dream or lifestyle against all odds and in defiance of conformity, their ageless celebration of youth and individuality embodying the very spirit of Rock‚Äôn‚ÄôRoll.\\" However, Wirtz became involved in a contractual dispute with EMI, and the ending of the pirate radio stations around the UK with the introduction of Radio 1 led to changes in the company's marketing approach. The second single from the proposed Teenage Opera, \\"Sam\\", was only a modest hit, and Wirtz and West lost interest in the project and ended their working partnership. In 2000, Wirtz wrote: \\"Quintessentially, what killed Teenage Opera was EMI‚Äôs blind and stubborn procrastination and political tomfoolery, which ultimately shot us all to shit. Nevertheless, even in its incomplete form and ultimate failure, Teenage Opera entered the history books as a bright torch and shining star, having set a precedent and broken down barriers to pave the way for others to succeed where I had failed.\\" References Category:1967 singles Category:Keith West songs Category:1967 songs Category:Parlophone singles ","title":"Excerpt from A Teenage Opera"},{"id":"12236984","text":"The Imperial College Act 1997 is a local Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The Conservators of the River Cam are the navigation authority for the River Cam in Cambridgeshire and were founded in 1702. History Cambridge had been a major inland port as a result of its position on the navigable River Cam for centuries, but this position changed with the draining of the Fens. The most notable change was caused by the construction of Denver sluice on the River Great Ouse, under the terms of the Drainage Act of 1649, which resulted in tidal waters being cut off from the River Cam. Navigation became difficult, and in 1697, both the University of Cambridge and the town corporation complained to parliament that the supply of goods to the town from Kings Lynn was greatly impaired.The Canals of Eastern England, (1977), John Boyes and Ronald Russell, David and Charles, Against this background, the Corporation sought to obtain an Act of Parliament in 1699, which would allow them to reinstate navigation to Cambridge. The Act was obtained on 27 February 1702Joseph Priestley, (1831), Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways, of Great Britain and established the Conservators as a legal body with powers to collect tolls in order to maintain the river. Tolls ranged from four shillings (20p) a ton for wine to one penny (0.4p) for each passenger using the river, and the Conservators, of whom there were a maximum of eleven, were empowered to mortgage the tolls in order to raise capital with which to improve the condition of the river. This they did, and built sluices at Jesus Green, Chesterton, Baits Bite and Clayhithe. Most of the tolls were collected at Clayhithe. Denver sluice collapsed prior to 1820, and although the Corporation of Cambridge opposed its rebuilding, it was rebuilt by 1850. Tolls on the river gradually increased, from ¬£432 in 1752, to over ¬£1,000 in 1803. 1835 was the best year, when tolls reached ¬£1,995, after which they declined again, although they did not drop below ¬£1,000 until 1847. The Conservators appear to have managed the river prudently, deriving a little extra revenue in rents from public houses which were constructed at each of the sluices. The Cam Navigation Act of 1813 gave the Conservators powers to raise tolls and to charge penalties, while the South Level Act of 1827 extended their control over the section of river from Popes Corner to Bottisham. This Act also increased the number of Conservators by two, as the Mayor of Cambridge and vice-chancellor of the University were appointed as official members of the body. They built locks at Baits Bite and Bottisham, and removed the sluice at Chesterton. They donated ¬£400 towards the cost of rebuilding the Great Bridge in 1823, and a further ¬£300 towards the cost of the small bridge in 1841. The following year they spent ¬£880 on constructing a house at Clayhithe, which included a large room suitable for meetings and banquets. The coming of the railways in 1845 brought to an end the success of the navigation. The Commissioners received ¬£1,393 from tolls in 1846 but only ¬£367 in 1850. Two further acts of parliament were obtained in 1851 and 1894, largely to alter the tolls, but receipts continued to fall, to ¬£99 in 1898 and ¬£79 in 1905. By this time, the lower river was managed by the South Level Commissioners, and the River Cam Commissioners again managed the river above Bottisham lock. Responsibility for the lower river passed to the Environment Agency in 1995, but the Conservators remain as the navigation authority for the river above Bottisham lock. The house at Clayhithe still stands, and is now the residence of the foreman of the Conservators.The River Great Ouse and Tributaries (2006), Andrew Hunter Blair, Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson, Notable Conservators *Gregory Wale References External links *Official website Category:Organisations based in Cambridgeshire Category:River navigations in the United Kingdom Category:River Cam ","title":"Conservators of the River Cam"},{"id":"12236996","text":"The Ardent-class ships of the line were a class of seven 64-gun third rates, designed for the Royal Navy by Sir Thomas Slade.

He later moved onto Grays Athletic where he impressed and earned a move to then Conference side Exeter City after catching the eye of manager Paul Tisdale. Watson is currently on his second spell at Bideford following a recent second spell with Dorchester. Watson is perhaps best known for his time at League Two side Exeter where he won promotion twice, first time through the conference playoffs (where he wore the number 32) and played at Wembley, and the second was an automatic promotion to league one the following season (where he wore the #19 shirt). He had two short loan spells with Forest Green and a third with Bath City before being released by Exeter due to a constant calf injury across 2 seasons and joining Eastbourne Borough. Watson has recently signed for Bideford for a second spell following time at Dorchester (two spells) and Truro City. Career Born in Shoreham-by-Sea, Watson has also played for Exeter City, Bognor Regis Town and Grays Athletic. He holds UEFA 'B' coaching badges for both football and futsal. With this he spent some of his time whilst at Bognor Regis coaching at Varndean School in Brighton. He then moved on to Grays Athletic. Watson made his debut for Exeter City on 24 March 2008 in the 3‚Äì1 away defeat at Weymouth, while on loan from Grays Athletic. Following Exeter's promotion to the Football League, Watson signed a one-year contract with the club. He made his debut as an Exeter signee, at home to Shrewsbury Town, in the 2‚Äì1 defeat in the Football League Trophy on 2 September 2008. On the last day of that year, he extended his contract to tie him to the club until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Watson joined Forest Green Rovers on loan for a month on 31 December 2009. The loan was terminated just a couple of days after however as Watson suffered a calf injury before the move. Forest Green signed Watson on loan again the next season in September 2010. He made his debut the next day in a 3‚Äì0 away loss against Barrow. He returned to Exeter City in October when his loan spell with Forest Green Rovers expired. In May 2011 Exeter announced that he would not be offered a new deal at the end of the season. Watson signed for Eastbourne Borough on 21 June 2011. A year later, he signed for Conference South Dorchester Town. He ended the 2012‚Äì13 season as Dorchester's top goal scorer with 17 goals in all competitions and signed a two-year contract in June 2013. With Dorchester experiencing financial problems, Watson and teammate Arran Pugh joined Pugh's old club Truro City in the Southern Premier League on 4 October 2013. Watson scored twice on his debut the following day as Truro lost 7‚Äì3 at home to St Albans City. He won Truro City's 'Golden Boot' award for 2013‚Äì14 with 13 goals in all competitions, but after a poor start to the following season he was placed on the transfer list by manager Steve Tully. He was later brought to Bideford by general manager Steve Massey, formerly manager at Truro City. He joined South West Peninsula League club St Martins in February 2018.

He was forced to retire from the professional game in 2001 because of injury. The highlight of Nogan's career was scoring two goals to put Preston North End 2‚Äì0 up in an FA Cup tie with holders Arsenal. However, Arsenal came back to win the game 4‚Äì2. In December 2007 he played with Welsh Football League side ENTO Aberaman Athletic. He also took part in Cardiff City's campaign in the 2008 Screwfix Western Masters competition.

The plan was for this route to form the basis of a regional broad gauge, , network complete with branch lines eastwards towards the radial trunk routes spreading out from the federal capital, and feeder lines westwards. Architects Alejandro Christophersen and Carl August Kihlberg were hired by the Hume Brothers (that worked as contractors for several railway companies including the BB&NWR;) to design the Bah√≠a Blanca terminus station, which was opened in 1891. On 29 January 1891, then president of Argentina Carlos Pellegrini promulgated a decree that allowed the company to build the Bah√≠a Blanca-Bernasconi section. The BB&NWR; was the first railway to reach La Pampa. That same year, construction of the Bernasconi-Hucal section was also officialized.\\"(1887 - 1914): El tren configura la pampa\\" by Armando Aguirre The railway finally reached Toay in 1897.

Criticism  In 2003, Belkin released a home-use wireless router which would occasionally replace users' HTTP requests with an advertisement for Belkin's filtering software. Belkin received some intense criticism for this from technically literate customers and others who described it as a man-in-the-middle attack or a form of session hijacking. Belkin initially treated this as a public relations problem rather than an inappropriate action on their part, but later relented and issued a firmware update deleting this functionality from the product. 080205 castlecops.com 080205 merit.edu In early 2009, a Belkin 'online sales representative' was discovered paying Amazon.com, Newegg and Buy.com users to manipulate reviews of a notoriously buggy Belkin router.

The real-line version of it (see below) is often used in physics, although rarely referred to by name. The theorem is named after Julian Sochocki, who proved it in 1868, and Josip Plemelj, who rediscovered it as a main ingredient of his solution of the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert problem in 1908.  Statement of the theorem  Let C be a smooth closed simple curve in the plane, and \\\\varphi an analytic function on C. Note that the Cauchy-type integral : \\\\phi(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_C\\\\frac{\\\\varphi(\\\\zeta) \\\\, d\\\\zeta}{\\\\zeta-z}, cannot be evaluated for any z on the curve C. However, on the interior and exterior of the curve, the integral produces analytic functions, which will be denoted \\\\phi_i inside C and \\\\phi_e outside. The Sokhotski-Plemelj formulas relate the limiting boundary values of these two analytic functions at a point z on C and the Cauchy principal value \\\\mathcal{P} of the integral: :\\\\lim_{w \\\\to z}\\\\phi_i(w) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\int_C\\\\frac{\\\\varphi(\\\\zeta) \\\\, d\\\\zeta}{\\\\zeta-z} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varphi(z), :\\\\lim_{w \\\\to z}\\\\phi_e(w) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\int_C\\\\frac{\\\\varphi(\\\\zeta) \\\\, d\\\\zeta}{\\\\zeta-z}-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varphi(z). Subsequent generalizations relax the smoothness requirements on curve C and the function œÜ. Version for the real line Especially important is the version for integrals over the real line. Let be a complex-valued function which is defined and continuous on the real line, and let and be real constants with a < 0 < b. Then :\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{f(x)}{x\\\\pm i \\\\varepsilon}\\\\,dx = \\\\mp i \\\\pi f(0) + \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\\\, dx, where \\\\mathcal{P} denotes the Cauchy principal value. (Note that this version makes no use of analyticity.)  Proof of the real version  A simple proof is as follows. : \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{f(x)}{x\\\\pm i \\\\varepsilon}\\\\,dx = \\\\mp i \\\\pi \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\pi(x^2+\\\\varepsilon^2)}f(x)\\\\,dx + \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_a^b \\\\frac{x^2}{x^2+\\\\varepsilon^2} \\\\, \\\\frac{f(x)}{x}\\\\, dx. For the first term, we note that is a nascent delta function, and therefore approaches a Dirac delta function in the limit. Therefore, the first term equals ‚àìi f(0). For the second term, we note that the factor approaches 1 for x ‚â´ Œµ, approaches 0 for x ‚â™ Œµ, and is exactly symmetric about 0. Therefore, in the limit, it turns the integral into a Cauchy principal value integral. For simple proof of the complex version of the formula and version for polydomains see:  Physics application  In quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, one often has to evaluate integrals of the form :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dE\\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty dt\\\\, f(E)\\\\exp(-iEt) where E is some energy and t is time. This expression, as written, is undefined (since the time integral does not converge), so it is typically modified by adding a negative real coefficient to t in the exponential, and then taking that to zero, i.e.: :\\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dE\\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty dt\\\\, f(E)\\\\exp(-iEt-\\\\varepsilon t) = -i \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon\\\\to 0^+} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{f(E)}{E-i\\\\varepsilon}\\\\,dE = \\\\pi f(0)-i \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{f(E)}{E}\\\\,dE, where the latter step uses the real version of the theorem.

History The ranch was founded by Father Rick Thomas who was moved on Christmas Day of 1972 to bring food to the poor people of Cd. Ju√°rez. His inspiration came from Scripture, Luke 14:13, \\"But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame and the blind.\\" Thomas reported that he and a couple dozen others brought enough food for about 160 people, but in the end they served more than 300 people, where they frequently scavenged at the local dump for a living with ample for take-home bags, and still more for children at two orphanages. Much of this is discussed in the Miracles section. Thomas's ongoing commitment started with food and clothing distribution and grew from there. Eventually, Juarez moved the dump, and a mission sprung up in its place which included a school, a daycare facility and a clinic. Ministries The ranch serves as a residence for a few community members, a summer camp for poor children from El Paso and a retreat center for visitors from all over the world. Groups who stay there usually offer a donation. =Pro-Life= Part of the ministry is for pro-life work, mostly on the state side in front of abortion clinics. They hold peaceful protests where they stand in front of the clinics with signs and pray for the people going in and their unborn babies. They also try to counsel the mothers as they go in and convince them of alternatives to abortion. They also try to educate the groups who come through as to the importance of the issue. =Mexican Poor= The other part of the ministry is ministering to the Mexican poor. They pray over the sick and feed the poor. While they hand out food every day during their ministry all over Cd. Ju√°rez which is packaged by volunteers either in their church building stateside, or at the mission site on the former dump in Ju√°rez. The food goes to people that would otherwise not eat very often on their minimum wage jobs. Miracles There have been alleged accounts of the miracles that occur with their ministry. It has been reported by visiting missions teams that the food and water that they bring across the border is allegedly multiplied in the same ways that the Bible cites in John 6:11-13. The alleged miracles started early when Fr Thomas brought food for 160 people on Christmas 1972, but allegedly ended up serving over 300 people at the Ju√°rez dump. There was also extra food that they took to two local orphanages. The miracles aren't limited to food, as missing pieces to a radio tower they were building for their in house radio station allegedly materialized after being lost in shipping. The ministry has grown and they now give out $6,000 worth of food a week and on top of the other ministries they operate. However, the Lord's Ranch does not ask for donations or take a collection during mass. They rely heavily on the donations of visiting groups.

Education Henry Markram obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Physiology and the History and Philosophy of Science from the University of Cape Town, South Africa and his PhD in Neurobiology from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel in 1991, under the supervision of Menahem Segal. During his PhD work, he discovered a link between acetylcholine and memory mechanisms by showing that acetylcholine modulates the primary receptor linked to synaptic plasticity. Personal life  Born in South Africa, Markram is now an Israeli citizen. Markram met his current wife, fellow neuroscientist Kamila Markram (b. 1975), at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt. Philippe Le B√©, \\"¬´ Avec Frontiers, les travaux des chercheurs sont publi√©s rapidement et de mani√®re √©quitable ¬ª\\", Le Temps, published on-line on Sunday 10 April 2016 (page visited on 10 April 2016). They moved to the √âcole polytechnique f√©d√©rale de Lausanne together and, in 2007, founded Frontiers Media. Markram has been married twice and has a total of five children, one of whom, Kai, has autism. Research Following his PhD, Markram went to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where he studied ion channels on synaptic terminals with Elise F. Stanley. As a Minerva Fellow he then went to the Laboratory of Bert Sakmann at the Max Planck Institute, Heidelberg, Germany, where he discovered calcium transients in dendrites evoked by sub-threshold activity, and by single action potentials propagating back into dendrites. He also began studying the connectivity between neurons, describing in great detail how layer 5 pyramidal neurons are interconnected. Some of his work altered the relative timing of single pre- and post-synaptic action potentials to reveal a learning mechanism operating between neurons where the relative timing in the millisecond range affects the coupling strength between neurons. The importance of such timing has been reproduced in many brain regions and is known as spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). Markram was appointed assistant professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where he started systematically dissecting out the neocortical column. He discovered that synaptic learning can also involve a change in synaptic dynamics (called redistribution of synaptic efficacy) rather than merely changing the strengths of connections. He also studied principles governing neocortical microcircuit structure, function, and emergent dynamics. Together with Wolfgang Maass he developed the so-called theory of liquid state machine, or high entropy computing. In 2002, he moved to EPFL as full professor and founder/director of the Brain Mind Institute and Director of the Center for Neuroscience and Technology. At the BMI, in the Laboratory for Neural Microcircuitry, Markram continues to study the organisation of the neocortical column, develops tools to carry out multi-neuron patch clamp recordings combined with laser and electrical stimulation as well as multi- site electrical recording, chemical imaging and gene expression. In 2013, the European Union funded the Human Brain Project, led by Markram, to the tune of $1.3 billion. Markram claimed that the project would create a simulation of the entire human brain on a supercomputer within a decade, revolutionising the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders. Less than two years into it, the project was recognised to be mismanaged and its claims overblown, and Markram was asked to step down. On 8 October 2015, the Blue Brain Project published the first digital reconstruction and simulation of the micro-circuitry of a neonatal rat somatosensory cortex.

The idea was based on Japan's success in the naval Battle of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War. As the new Type 93 torpedoes had a range longer than that of contemporary battleships' main battery, the concept was to have a high speed strike force attack an enemy fleet at night with a massive and overwhelming barrage of torpedoes. Major surface combatants would follow up at dawn to finish off the wounded enemy. ≈åi and Kitakami were subsequently modified with ten quadruple mount torpedo launchers (a total of 40 tubes), arranged in two broadside rows of five, i.e. 20 per side. The ships were assigned to the CruDiv 9 of the IJN 1st Fleet. However, the rapid development of naval aviation and submarine warfare in the 1930s quickly made this plan obsolete. In January 1942, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Matome Ugaki expressed strong disapproval of the newly remodeled torpedo cruisers and urged a revision to the Navy's tactics.Ugaki, Fading Victory; page 74 While the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff debated the issue, ≈åi and Kitakami were converted to high speed transports, with , and Kitakami was subsequently converted into a carrier for kaiten suicide torpedoes. Design The Kuma- class hull design was based on a 5,500 ton nominal displacement, with a high freeboard and light bridge structure, behind which was a tripod mast with the fire control platform and two searchlights. The design proved so versatile that it became the standard upon which all future light cruisers in the Japanese navy would be based. The propulsion system for the Kuma class was based on four axial deceleration turbines with 12 boilers, providing . Ten boilers were designed to burn heavy oil, and the remaining two burned a mixture of coal and oil. With improvements in geared-turbine engine technology, the Kuma-class vessels were capable of the high speed of , and a range of at . The silhouette of the Kuma class was discernible by its three smoke stacks, with the stacks flaring out in a trumpet shape. The number of 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns was increased from four on the Tenry≈´ class to seven on the Kuma class, centerline mounted in individual gun turrets, (two fore, three after and one on either side of the bridge). The positioning meant that only six of the guns could be brought to bear in a broadside. As with the Tenry≈´ class, the Kuma class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns and two 6.5 mm machine guns. Provision was made for 48 naval mines. The two triple torpedo launchers on the Tenry≈´ class was changed to four double launchers, placed in pairs so that four torpedoes could be fired on each side. Eight reloads were also provided. Kiso was unique in that it had both a forward and aft flat surfaced superstructure, with a rotating floatplane take-off platform located aft. The platform appears to have never been used, and was removed in 1922, but her superstructure retained the shape of the hangar. = In service modifications= From 1931-1932, provision was made for a catapult to launch one floatplane (typically a Kawanishi E7K1 \\"Alf\\" floatplane ) for scouting purposes on Kuma and Tama. The catapult was situated aft, in between the No.5 and No.6 turrets. From 1933-1934, the ships were renovated with a modified superstructure, replacing the canvas sides of the bridge with steel plate, and building a rangefinder tower behind the bridge was with either an or rangefinder. Kiso was also given anti-rain caps on her two forward stacks, which gave her a unique appearance. By 1941, the 8-cm Type 3 guns were replaced by a twin-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns, and the 6.5 mm machine guns were upgraded to 13.2 mm. All of the ships in the Kuma class were progressively upgraded during the Pacific War. The modifications varied from vessel to vessel, but consisted of removing the aircraft catapult and at least one of the main 140-mm turrets, and replacing with twin or triple-mount Type 96 25-mm anti-aircraft guns. From 1943-1944, Kiso and Tama were given a twin turret with 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns. Kiso, Tama and Kitakami were the only in the class to receive radar. In August 1941 ≈åi, Kitakami and Kiso were to undergo a conversion to torpedo cruisers to form a special torpedo attack squadron, but not enough Type 92 quadruple torpedo mounts were available so only the first two were converted,Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , page 16; both ships three aft turrets were replaced by ten quadruple torpedo mounts, five per side, with a total of 40 torpedoes. In August 1942, they were modified into fast transports, with all of the torpedo tubes removed and replaced by Daihatsu class landing craft, with depth charge racks and two Type 96 triple-mount anti-aircraft guns. After Kitakami was damaged in 1944, she was converted into a kaiten carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth charge racks and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots. Ships in class Five vessels were built in the Kuma class. Only one (Kitakami) survived the Pacific War. ; (ÁêÉÁ£®) Ordered in 1917 to the Sasebo Navy Yard, launched 14 July 1919, and completed 31 August 1920, Kuma was active in screening the landings of Japanese troops in the Philippines in the early months of World War II, and remained stationed there for local defense.

In July 2007, he came under the spotlight when he was detained by the Royal Malaysian Police for allegedly violating the Official Secrets Act.Malcom A. Glenn, Malaysian Blogger Disputes Arrest, Harvard Crimson, 20 July 2007 He was then working with current Opposition Leader Anwar Ibrahim. After being detained for a few days, he was released with no charges preferred. Nat was the editor of a book on the conflict between former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad and Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, titled Mahathir vs. Abdullah: Covert Wars and Challenged Legacies and published in early 2007. He later co- edited a book on religion and politics with John Lee, Religion Under Siege?: Lina Joy, the Islamic State and Freedom of Faith, published in early 2008. Nat has since co-edited two books on Malaysian politics with Lee, Political Tsunami: An End to Hegemony in Malaysia? and Where is Justice?: Death and Brutality in Custody. The latter, a book concerning custodial deaths, including high-profile cases such as those of Altantuya Shaariibuu and Teoh Beng Hock, was confiscated from a number of bookstores in late January 2010, a month after its release, prompting concerns that it may have been banned by the Home Ministry. Early life Nat originally lived in the Damansara Utama suburb of Petaling Jaya, before moving to Taman Tun Dr Ismail in Kuala Lumpur. He attended Sunway University College where he studied for his A Levels, before attending Harvard College in the United States, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in 2004 with a Special Concentration in Peace and Conflict Studies. Political work In February 2007, a book edited by Nat, titled Mahathir vs. Abdullah: Covert Wars and Challenged Legacies, was published by the publishing arm of Malaysiakini. The book carried commentary by politicians such as Anwar Ibrahim and Lim Guan Eng, and also articles by local commentators and activists. A month later, Nat joined Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), serving as an aide to Tian Chua, the party's information chief. He later began working for the party's de facto head, Anwar Ibrahim, as Anwar's secretary for work related to the Foundation For the Future, which Anwar was then president of. =Detention= On 13 July 2007, Tan was detained by three plainclothes policemen, who requested that he bring his notebook computer and follow them to the police headquarters at Bukit Aman. However, Tan's lawyer later stated that according to Bukit Aman, there was no record of his detention. A police report was filed alleging Tan had been kidnapped. At 10pm that day, roughly six hours after his disappearance, Bukit Aman confirmed that they were holding Tan. Malaysiakini reported that \\"According to the police, Tan will be held for 24 hours by the Cyber Crime Unit in Jalan Dato Onn to facilitate investigation under the Official Secrets Act,\\" and that Tan's home desktop computer had been seized as well. Shortly afterwards, Tan was transferred to a different police station. It was announced that he would appear before a magistrate the following day for further remand. On 14 July, Tan was remanded for four days by a magistrate, who rejected the police request for a 14-day remand order, the maximum permitted under the law. The proceedings commenced before the arrival of his lawyers, who later alleged that the investigating police officers intentionally refrained from informing them about the proceedings, and that the court police had also misled the investigating officers about Tan's lawyers' whereabouts. An investigating officer later confirmed that Tan was being investigated for a potential violation of section 8 of the Official Secrets Act, which pertains to \\"wrongful communication, etc. of [an] official secret\\". Tan had reportedly published a comment on his blog alleging corruption on the part of Deputy Internal Security Minister Johari Baharom. After Tan's arrest, Johari announced that he had instructed the police to investigate \\"lies\\" published on the internet. One of Tan's lawyers, R. Sivarasa, stated that the remand order was meant only to \\"put Nat under duress\\". Citing the fact that several documents, CDs, and computers had been seized from Tan's office, home and car, Sivarasa stated: On 18 July, Tan was released at 5.15pm on police bail, but was required to report back to the Commercial Crime Investigation Department in Kuala Lumpur on 31 July. =Response to detention= After Tan's detention, Anwar condemned his arrest, and called for Tan's family members and lawyers to be given access to him. Parliamentary Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang condemned \\"secretive circumstances in the first seven hours of Tan's arrest\\", calling them \\"a scandal which speaks of a police which has yet to fully accept that the first principle of policing in a democratic system must be policing for the people and not policing to serve the government leaders of the day\\". Lim also suggested that Tan might be a \\"pawn\\" used by the police and government to \\"protect their vested interests\\". Human rights watchdog Suara Rakyat Malaysia (Suaram) alleged that Tan's rights under the Constitution of Malaysia had been violated: Other organisations that condemned Tan's detention included the Malaysian Bar Council, the Centre for Independent Journalism and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). The Sun condemned the circumstances surrounding Tan's detention as \\"attempts at obstructing justice\\", and called them \\"politically motivated\\". In response to a question in Parliament from Lim about two months after Tan's detention, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi stated that \\"The arrest and the police report [filed against another blogger] are usual procedures followed by the police.\\" Post- detention In early 2008, Kinibooks, the publishing branch of Malaysiakini, published Religion Under Siege?: Lina Joy, the Islamic State and Freedom of Faith, a book Tan co-edited with John Lee about religious and political issues in Malaysia. It later published Tan's and Lee's Political Tsunami: An End to Hegemony in Malaysia? in 2008, and Where is Justice?: Death and Brutality in Custody in late 2009. In late January 2010, about a month after its release, the Royal Malaysian Police and Home Ministry confiscated copies of Where is Justice? from bookstores in Penang and Malacca, prompting concerns that it may have been banned. The authorities also confiscated copies of 1FunnyMalaysia, another Kinibooks book, claiming that both books \\"could pose a threat to public order, morality, security\\". In a statement on his blog, Tan insisted that \\"We took considerable pains to ensure that everything in Where is Justice was carefully written to be factual, and all opinion therein had been previously published online. ... Don't shoot the messenger.\\" On 5 February 2010, police in Seremban, Negri Sembilan, confiscated 12 copies of Where is Justice? and 10 of 1FunnyMalaysia; an officer who participated in the raid said \\"We are not banning the books but are just taking them to analyse their content.\\" Malaysiakini is reportedly consulting its lawyers and considering legal action. A few days later, a further eight copies were seized from another Seremban bookstore, and another four from a Johor Bahru bookstore. Writer and filmmaker Amir Muhammad criticised the seizures, saying: \\"Every publisher gives five copies of each book to the National Library. So, why can't the authorities borrow the books from there instead of confiscating them from bookstores? If they need it for 'study' or 'review', why can't they buy a copy instead of taking all the copies for free? I'm sure one is enough for their purpose.\\" He also urged bookstores to be proactive in opposing the confiscations, citing a previous instance where \\"Only one of [Salman] Rushdie's books, The Satanic Verses, was banned by the Home Ministry but MPH removed all of Rushdie's books from the shelves. That's a case in point of booksellers taking a soft stand against the banning of books. This is self- censorship.\\" Home Ministry deputy secretary-general Ahmad Fuad Ab Aziz later said that the ministry's enforcement officers found the titles to be \\"offensive\\" and in violation of the Printing Presses and Publications Act 1984. However, he said the ministry was still deciding whether it would ban the books in question. Besides writing and publishing, Nathaniel Tan is also very passionate in education. He has served on the Harvard board of interviewers for three years ‚Äì two of which (2008 and 2009) as an interviewer, and two (2010 and 2011) as an observer. He has also been one of the speakers for several US University Admission talks in Malaysia. He has previously provided assistance to students applying to US universities. During his first year (2009) in this field, a number of Nat's 25 students were offered admission into Yale, Stanford, Columbia, Cornell, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Chicago, among others.

The team gambled that they could move down into the second round and still select Tony Brackens, while changing a seventh-round selection into a third (#67-Clay Shiver). The Jacksonville Jaguars ended up selecting Brackens and the Cowboys still needing a defensive end, drafted Pittman in the second round (37th overall). He was originally seen as a project, with the plan of eventually replacing Shante Carver. As a rookie, he contributed on special teams with 17 tackles (tied for third on the team). He also had 5 defensive tackles and 5 quarterback pressures. The next year, he registered 6 tackles (2 for loss), one sack, one quarterback pressure and 3 special teams tackles.

The name derives from the name of the highway: Rublyovskoye shosse. There is no official administrative unit called \\"Rublyovka\\", but this name has become popular in society and in mass media. The area features good ecology and rather clear air (in comparison to Moscow and the rest of its suburbs). Many Russian government officials and successful businesspeople reside in the gated communities of Rublevka. Real-estate prices there are among the highest in the world. http://articles.dailypress.com/2005-05-10/features/0505100001_1_russian- version-moscow-billionaires http://www.dw.de/revealing-film-on-russian-elite- faces-mysterious-roadblock/a-3005097-1 History Rublyovskoe Highway has been a place for the privileged ever since it was the Tsars road‚Äô in the 16th century: for the entire Romanov dynasty. Russian rulers Mikhail Fyodorovich, Aleksey Mikhaylovich, Peter the Great and Catherine the Great made pilgrimages to the Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery by this road. Also this picturesque area was always the favorite place for the royal falcon hunting. Here, near the sovereigns, the Russian nobility also made their homes, particularly the Princes Yusupov, Shuvalov and Golitsyn. At the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Zubalov family owned the estate Rubllevka. The times changed, but the nobility continued to live at Rublyovka. This is where the dachas of Lenin, Stalin were located, as well as the summer residences of all the subsequent general secretaries, from Nikita Khrushchev to Mikhail Gorbachev. Their sidekicks also settled here (Anastas Mikoyan, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Nikolai Yezhov) ‚Äì side-by-side with famous scientists, artists and writers (Mstislav Rostropovich, Andrei Sakharov, Dmitry Shostakovich), and foreign diplomats. And they all lived on a small stretch of highway that is only 35 kilometers long. During the Soviet period, General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev may have gone for a walk and encountered Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was being hunted by the KGB and hiding out at Mstislav Rostropovich's dacha. \\"Now President Vladimir Putin should he wish to venture beyond the wall of his residence and take a walk in the park, could well bump into the wife of Khodorkovsky, the mutinous oligarch that he has left to rot in jail\\". In the mid-1990s, Rublyovka, which borders on the pristine and well-forested bank of the Moscow River was swiftly privatized by stars of show-business, the demi monde, officials and industrial magnates, and turned into a kind of a ‚Äòmillionaires‚Äô ghetto‚Äô, or a Russian Beverly Hills, \\"where it is outrageous not to be good- looking\\". Here you can find the most expensive market in the world, and the most expensive sports club, as well as the most exclusive boutiques and the highest fences, with an army of thousands of security guards\\". Geography and amenities The district is 40 minutes to Moscow via a two-lane paved road; however, the road is sometimes closed due to travels by Vladimir Putin and other important Russian officials. There is a high-end shopping mall, Barvikha Luxury Village, where such brands as Prada, Gucci, and Dolce & Gabbana are offered. The mall includes Bentley and Ferrari/Maserati dealerships. There is also a wedding palace and a concert hall. Gated communities include Tagankovo.  Notable residents  The area is known for its residents' high net worth. It was revealed in January 2020 that Mikhail Mishustin and his wife own a property in Rublyovka. Mishustin was named by President Vladimir Putin in January as the nominee to become the next Russian Prime Minister. His Rublyovka home and downtown apartment have a combined value of $10m (¬£7.6m). *Mikhail Mishustin *Viktor Zolotov former personal security chief for Vladimir Putin, currently chief of Russia National Guard (Rosguard) resides at his newer home with on the former Mikoyan estate or Zubalovo-2 which the Russia Ministry of Defense is the legal owner The one hectare of land for his new home is valued at 200 million rubles in 2014.

It may be detailed enough to include location, floor, row, rack, panel and port for each circuit component or it may simply refer to another previously engineered circuit. A DLR may describe an end-to-end circuit that comprises physical or virtual circuits. As an example, a physical facility would include a panel, rack and port, while a virtual facility may be a channel on a channelized circuit, such as a T1 on a previously engineered DS3. Explanation There are two parts to a circuit: # Physical design/path # Logical design/path The design team is responsible to find the best, lowest- cost path for the circuit being designed, and get the physical line provisioned. When their role is complete, the order is passed to another team who take care of establishing logical design and accessibility of the circuit. Every network element that is part of the circuit needs to be built and checked. The DLR provides a systematic way to identify the network elements and their attributes. With the aid of the DLR, a team installs the circuit and tests it to check that it meets the customer's specifications. There are many ways to prepare a DLR.

Early life Lyon was born at The Lodge, Rocester, Staffordshire, the eldest son of Charles William Lyon and his wife Florence. His father was a cotton manufacturer who ran a mill at Rocester and was a Justice of the Peace. Military career Lyon was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, the North Staffordshire Regiment in February 1900, but two months later, in April of the same year, transferred to the 2nd Battalion of the regiment. The 2nd Battalion was a regular battalion and was at the time on active service in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where Lyon joined the battalion and served with it throughout the war being Mentioned in Despatches in 1901. He was promoted to lieutenant on 19 January 1901, while in South Africa. After peace was declared in May 1902, Lyon left Cape Town on board the SS Bavarian and arrived in the United Kingdom the following month. He remained with the 2nd Battalion when it was posted to India in 1903 where he became adjutant and was promoted to captain. In 1912 Lyon was seconded as a student to the Staff College, Camberley Upon leaving the Staff College, Lyon was posted to the 1st Battalion, which was then in Ireland; and he was still with it at the outbreak of the First World War. The battalion mobilised in August 1914 and went to France in September, but Lyon only remained with it for another month, until October 1914, when he was attached to the General Staff as a Staff Captain. This was the first of many staff posts that he held until the end of his career, and he never returned to regimental duty. In March 1915 he moved to the staff of the Quartermaster general, and by the end of the war held the substantive rank of Major, the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and the temporary rank of Brigadier-General.

Between his return from South Africa and his departure for India Lyon played two first-class cricket matches for Derbyshire in the 1902 season. The first was in a match against Worcestershire, which resulted in a draw. Less than a week later, Lyon made his only other first-class appearance, against Nottinghamshire. He was a right-handed batsman and made six runs in his two matches. He bowled two overs without taking a wicket. After the First World War, he played for the Free Foresters Cricket Club. Personal life Lyon married Gwenlliam Mary Campbell, a member of the Minton pottery family. The couple had one daughter, Frances Mary Lyon.

The road has high street chains including Next, Zara, French Connection, Pret a Manger and large branches of department stores Debenhams and House of Fraser. North End was closed off to all forms of motor traffic in 1989, to entice shoppers to choose Croydon over its main south-east London rival Bromley. On 26 November 2013, the Croydon Council approved a redevelopment of the town centre by The Croydon Partnership, a joint venture by The Westfield Corporation and Hammerson which would see the Whitgift Centre replaced with a Westfield shopping centre. London Mayor Boris Johnson approved the plan the following day. The Croydon Advertiser listed the approval as an \\"historic night for Croydon\\". North End was the home of Allders department store, opened in 1862, which later became the flagship store of a chain extending across England and Wales. The company went into administration in 2005, and the Croydon store, the last to survive, closed in 2012. At the time of its closure it was the third-largest department store in Britain.

The rail services are provided by Southern and Thameslink.East Croydon National Rail Tramlink also provides frequent services from the four nearby stops. Croydon Central railway station was a former station at what is now the Croydon Clocktower. It was built so that shoppers could get closer to the main district but the idea failed and a new Town Hall was built in 1895 on the site of the platforms, with the remainder of the station site being incorporated into what became a small public park, now called the Queen's Gardens, where the retaining wall of the railway is visible as the northern boundary of the Gardens along Katherine Street.

It uses a concrete-encased electrode to improve grounding in dry areas. The technique is used in construction of concrete foundations. History  During World War II, the U.S. Army required a grounding system for bomb storage vaults near Tucson and Flagstaff, Arizona. Conventional grounding systems did not work well in this location since the desert terrain had no water table and very little rainfall. The extremely dry soil conditions would have required hundreds of feet of rods to be driven into the earth to create a low impedance ground to protect the buildings from lightning strikes. In 1942, Herbert G. Ufer was a consultant working for the U.S. Army. Ufer was given the task of finding a lower cost and more practical alternative to traditional copper rod grounds for these dry locations. Ufer discovered that concrete had better conductivity than most types of soil. Ufer then developed a grounding scheme based on encasing the grounding conductors in concrete. This method proved to be very effective, and was implemented throughout the Arizona test site. After the war, Ufer continued to test his grounding method, and his results were published in a paper presented at the IEEE Western Appliance Technical Conference in 1963. The use of concrete enclosed grounding conductors was added to the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) in 1968. It was not required to be used if a water pipe or other grounding electrode was present. In 1978, the NEC allowed 1/2 inch rebar to be used as a grounding electrode [NEC 250.52(A)(3)]. The NEC refers to this type of ground as a \\"Concrete Encased Electrode\\" (CEE) instead of using the name Ufer ground. Over the years, the term \\"Ufer ground\\" has become synonymous with the use of any type of concrete enclosed grounding conductor, whether it conforms to Ufer's original grounding scheme or not.\\"NFPA's Dictionary of Electrical Terms\\" By H. Brooke Stauffer  Construction  Concrete is naturally basic (has high pH). Ufer observed this meant that it had a ready supply of ions and so provides a better electrical ground than almost any type of soil. Ufer also found that the soil around the concrete became \\"doped\\", and its subsequent rise in pH caused the overall impedance of the soil itself to be reduced. The concrete enclosure also increases the surface area of the connection between the grounding conductor and the surrounding soil, which also helps to reduce the overall impedance of the connection. Ufer's original grounding scheme used copper encased in concrete. However, the high pH of concrete often causes the copper to chip and flake. For this reason, steel is often used instead of copper. When homes are built on concrete slabs, it is common practice to bring one end of the rebar up out of the concrete at a convenient location to make an easy connection point for the grounding electrode.\\"Electrical Wiring Residential: Based on the 2005 National Electric Code\\" By Ray C. Mullin Ufer grounds, when present, are preferred over the use of grounding rods. In some areas (like Des Moines, Iowa) Ufer grounds are required for all residential and commercial buildings.\\"Ufer Grounding System\\" Permit and Development Center, City of Des Moines Community Development The conductivity of the soil usually determines if Ufer grounds are required in any particular area. A Ufer ground of specified minimum dimensions is recognized by the U.S. National Electrical Code as a grounding electrode.NEC rule 250.52(3) The grounding conductors must have sufficient cover by the concrete to prevent damage when dissipating high-current lightning strikes. A disadvantage of Ufer grounds is that the moisture in the concrete can flash into steam during a lightning strike or similar high energy fault condition. This can crack the surrounding concrete and damage the building foundation.\\"Electrical Overstress/Electrostatic Discharge Symposium Volume 22\\" By ESD Association, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers External links * The \\"Ufer\\" Ground * A new look at the Ufer ground system References Category:Electricity Category:Foundations (buildings and structures) ","title":"Ufer ground"},{"id":"12237609","text":"The Cessna Model EC-1 was a 1930s American single-seat tourer built by the Cessna Aircraft Company.

Biography Details of Bennett's life are limited, but it is known that he died in September 1784, after serving as organist at St. Dionis Backchuch Fenchurch in London, for over thirty years. He had been a pupil of Johann Christoph Pepusch. As the typical versatile eighteenth-century English musician, he played the organ and the viola, taught the harpsichord, and performed at Drury Lane Theatre as a singer in the chorus and as a dancer. According to Thomas Mortimer's The Universal Director (1763), he lived at Queen-square Bloomsbury, and succeeded Charles Burney as organist at St. Dionis-Backchurch, Fenchurch Street (demolished in 1878), in 1752. An interesting aside for organists is the information provided in the church minutes for July 27, 1749: \\". . . that the Salary of Organist be Thirty pounds p. Ann and that he be annually chose. . . .That the person who shall be chosen Organist shall attend in Person twice on every Sunday and on other usual Festivals, and to have no Deputy but in case of sickness.\\"Beechey G. Ten Eighteenth century voluntaries [Vol 6 or Recent Researches in the Music of the Baroque era] A-R Editions, Madison 1969 Henry William Beechey suggested that in 1760 Bennett must have been suffering financial difficulty as he applied for a second organist‚Äôs post (with permission from St. Dionis) which he was unsuccessful in gaining. It was common in that period for organists to serve more than one church simultaneously.  Works  The Ten Voluntaries for the Organ or Harpsichord are his only works known to this day; they were published by the composer in 1758, and printed a number of times since. In the last fifty years, various selections from them have printed in collections: H. Diack Johnstone published numbers 9 and 10 in 1966 (Novello, London); Beechey published (nos 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 & 10) in 1969, and Diack Johnstone also published 6 of them (nos 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, & 10) in 1988. A new complete edition of the entire set has been published in 2002, in Cambridge (UK) [reference required as there appears no such publication 2016]. A complete edition can be found on the IMSLP site.

The British Museum and the collection at Oxford contain the subscription list which lists no less than 227 names including Boyce, Stanley and George Fredrick Handel.  Ornamentation in the Ten Voluntaries  In his Voluntaries, Bennett uses three of the usual keyboard ornamens: the trill (shake), the beat (modern equivalent the lower mordent) and the appoggiatura. The trill or shake While the standard interpretation (beginning bay the upper note) is should always be tried first, alternatives could be used depending upon the context. Which involves taking into account both the speed and pitch of adjacent notes. If the music is fast the number of shakes will be reduced, or even converted to a modern-day acciaccatura. The Beat (modern equivalent to the lower mordent) For the beat you play the written note and the lower note or half-note, according to the key you are in.Ferguson H. Keyboard Interpretation: from the 14th to the 19th Century. Oxford University Press, 1987, pp. 152 According to Diack Johnstone \\"this seems generally to be regarded as the exact inversion of the trill, beginning on the note below the principal note. However, several authorities table the beat as beginning on the principal note, and it is impossible to tell from the music which interpretation is intended.\\".H.D. Johnstone, 1966 (ed.) Preface to John Stanley: Voluntary in A minor Op.6 No.2 for Organ, Novello, London.Ferguson H. Keyboard Interpretation: from the 14th to the 19th Century. Oxford University Press, 1987. [now out of print] The Appoggiatura This was interpreted the normal way taking half the value for an un-dotted note and two-thirds the value when the note is dotted.

Biography  Norodom Monineath was born on 18 June 1936, in Saigon, French Indochina, in present- day Vietnam. She was born Paule-Monique Izzi, and is sometimes referred to as Queen Monique. Her father, Jean-Fran√ßois Izzi, was a French banker of Corsican, French and Italian descent, who was Director of Cr√©dit Foncier in Saigon, and killed in World War II.

She met Norodom Sihanouk in 1951, when he awarded her first prize in a beauty pageant. They married privately in 1952, and a second time, officially, in 1955. She has been described as the close confidant of Sihanouk.Benny Widyono: Dancing in Shadows: Sihanouk, the Khmer Rouge, and the United Nations in Cambodia (Asian Voices) In 1955, her husband abdicated, but remained in charge of the rule of the country: in 1960, he became head of state again, but known as premier and with the title prince. Princess Monique, as she was called during this period, was exposed to some criticism from both the Khmer Republic as well as the Khmer Rouge for her life during the reign of Sihanouk in the 1960s.Jacobsen, Trudy (2008). Lost Goddesses: The Denial of Female Power in Cambodian History. NIAS Press. The propaganda of the Khmer Republic was later to accuse her of having caused the strained relationship between Sihanouk and his mother, the popular queen mother Sisowath Kossamak;Trudy Jacobsen: Lost Goddesses: The Denial of Female Power in Cambodian History they claimed that she had advised Sihanouk to introduce the unpopular state casino, which was at the time viewed as a symbol of national decadence,Trudy Jacobsen: Lost Goddesses: The Denial of Female Power in Cambodian History and alleged that she, her mother and her brother contributed to corruption by promoting protegees to lucrative offices.Trudy Jacobsen: Lost Goddesses: The Denial of Female Power in Cambodian History The Khmer Rouge reportedly once burned her image in effigy for corruption. Princess Monique served as President of the Cambodian Red Cross (CRC) in 1967-1970. After the Cambodian coup of 1970, she joined her husband in exile first in Beijing in China and then North Korea. As guests of the North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, a palace with 60 rooms was given them as their residence during their stay. In 1973, Norodom Sihanouk allied himself with the Khmer Rouge against their common enemy, Lon Nol. The royal couple also made a visit to Khmer Rouge territory in Cambodia before returning to China. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the Khmer Rouge in April 1975, she returned to the royal palace in Phnom Penh in Cambodia with her husband, who was appointed nominal head of state by the Khmer Rouge. From 1976 onward, however, they were both kept under house arrest by the Khmer Rouge. They were reportedly subjected to a political re-education program during these years, and at least 18 members of the extended royal house were killed. Reportedly, the regime suggested to have them executed, but this was prevented by intervention by China and North Korea. In January 1979, Pol Pot allowed for her and her husband to be evacuated from Cambodia by the Chinese. The original plan was to evacuate only Sihanouk and Monineath, but Pol Pot himself insisted that all members of the royal house should be given a place on the Chinese plane.Nhem Broaden: The Khmer Rouge: Ideology, Militarism, and the Revolution that Consumed a Generation, 2013 Norodom Monineath spent the following years with her spouse as state guests of China and North Korea. She is credited to have played some part in the peace negotiations arranged between Sihanouk and Hun Sen by Tong Siv Eng in 1987 and 1988, and she is known to have been present during the negotiations. In 1991, she returned to Cambodia with Sihanouk. On 22 February 1992, she was elevated by the King to the rank of Samdech Preah Cheayea.

It was designed by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and structural engineer Nikolai Nikitin, and declared the tallest statue in the world in 1967. At , it is the tallest statue in Europe and the tallest statue (excluding pedestals) of a woman in the world. Construction Eternal Flame in Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex The work of sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and engineer Nikolai Nikitin is an figure of a woman stepping forward with a raised sword. The statue is an allegorical image of the Motherland, which calls on its sons and daughters to repulse the enemy and return to the attack. The Motherland Calls is highly complex from an engineering point of view, due to its characteristic posture with a sword raised high in the right hand and the left hand extended in a calling gesture. The technology behind the hollow statue is based on a combination of prestressed concrete with wire ropes, a solution which can also be found in another work of Nikitin's, the Ostankino Tower in Moscow. The sculpture is hollow. Inside, the entire statue consists of separate cells or chambers, like rooms in a building. The concrete walls of the sculpture are thick. The construction of the monument was started in May 1959 and completed on 15 October 1967. It was the tallest sculpture in the world at the time of creation. Restoration work on the main monument of the monument complex was done in 1972, when the sword was replaced by another entirely consisting of stainless steel. It is most likely that Vuchetich sculpted the figure from the discus thrower Nina Dumbadze, and the face from his wife Vera. According to various sources, Valentina Izotova or Ekaterina Grebneva–ì–∞–ª–∫–∏–Ω–∞, –ê–Ω–Ω–∞. posed for the sculpture. It is also believed that the statue has parallels with the figure of the \\"Marseillaise\\" on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and that the statue's pose was inspired by the statue of Nike of Samothrace.

Deformations in the design of the sword also caused the movement of sheets of titanium plating, creating pitched sound of thundering metal. Therefore, in 1972, the blade was replaced by another ‚Äì entirely consisting of stainless steel ‚Äì and in the upper part of the sword, holes were provided that made it possible to reduce its windage. In 2009, reports said the statue was leaning due to changes in groundwater level causing movement of the foundations. The statue is not fixed to its foundations and is held in place only by its weight. An anonymous official claimed that it had shifted and was not expected to move much farther without collapsing. A program of monument restoration was developed in 2008‚Äì2009, and conservation and restoration work started in 2010. In spring 2017, a comprehensive restoration program of the monument at a cost of two billion rubles ($35,000,000) began. The ropes inside the statue were replaced to ensure its stability, the interior and all formed cracks were repaired and more than of concrete surfaces were restored. The restoration of the statue was completed by April 2020.

It consists of two pieces: the receptacle, and the lid which includes a pin that is used to carry the lime to the mouth while chewing coca leaves. Since the chewing of coca is sacred for the indigenous people, the poporos are also attributed with mystical powers and social status. In Colombia, poporos are found in archaeological remains from the Chibcha, Muisca, and Quimbaya cultures among others. The materials used in the early periods are mainly pottery and carved stone. In classic periods gold and tumbaga are the most frequent: an example of this is the Poporo Quimbaya exhibited in the Gold Museum which is a national symbol. At the present time, the indigenous people of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta still use poporos made with the dried fruits of a plant of genus cucurbita (totumo), in the traditional way. Poporo Quimbaya One particularly famous poporo, the Poporo Quimbaya, is a pre-Columbian artpiece of the classic quimbaya period, currently exhibited in the Gold Museum in Bogot√°, Colombia. Its primary use was as a ceremonial device for chewing of coca leaves during religious ceremonies. It was made around 300 CE with a lost-wax casting process. It is believed that the artpiece was stolen from a burial chamber in the early 1930s, on Loma del Pajarito (\\"Birdie Hill\\") near Anori in the Antioquia department, where, at the time, the grave robbing of indigenous tombs was very common, often ending with destruction of important archeological pieces in order to extract the gold.\\"Quimbaya Poporo.\\" Museo del Oro. Retrieved 15 Jan 2011. In 1939 the Banco de la Rep√∫blica, the central bank of Colombia, purchased the Poporo Quimbaya, in an effort to preserve it from destruction. This began a larger project of preservation of pre-Columbian goldwork that led to the creation of the Gold Museum in Bogot√°. The Poporo Quimbaya is an unusual piece, made of tumbaga, with oddly minimalistic lines, that give it a modern look. It is one of the most recognized pre-Columbian artpieces, being often used as a symbol of the indigenous pre-Columbian culture. It has been depicted in the Colombian currency, in coins and bills.

Though cutaway drawing are not dimensioned manufacturing blueprints, they are meticulously drawn by a handful of devoted artists who either had access to manufacturing details or deduced them by observing the visible evidence of the hidden skeleton (e.g. rivet lines, etc.). The goal of this drawings in studies can be to identify common design patterns for particular vehicle classes. Thus, the accuracy of most of these drawings, while not 100 percent, is certainly high enough for this purpose.Mark D. Sensmeier, and Jamshid A. Samareh (2003). \\"A Study of Vehicle Structural Layouts in Post-WWII Aircraft\\" Paper American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The technique is used extensively in computer- aided design, see first image. It has also been incorporated into the user interface of some video games. In The Sims, for instance, users can select through a control panel whether to view the house they are building with no walls, cutaway walls, or full walls.  History  An engraving by Georgius Agricola illustrating the mining practice of fire-setting The cutaway view and the exploded view were minor graphic inventions of the Renaissance that also clarified pictorial representation. This cutaway view originates in the early fifteenth century notebooks of Marino Taccola (1382 ‚Äì 1453). In the 16th century cutaway views in definite form were used in Georgius Agricola's (1494-1555) mining book De Re Metallica to illustrate underground operations.Eugene S. Ferguson (1999). Engineering and the Mind's Eye. p.82. The 1556 book is a complete and systematic treatise on mining and extractive metallurgy, illustrated with many fine and interesting woodcuts which illustrate every conceivable process to extract ores from the ground and metal from the ore, and more besides. It shows the many watermills used in mining, such as the machine for lifting men and material into and out of a mine shaft, see image. The term \\"Cutaway drawing\\" was already in use in the 19th century but, became popular in the 1930s.  Technique  The location and shape to cut the outside object depends on many different factors, for example: * the sizes and shapes of the inside and outside objects, * the semantics of the objects, * personal taste, etc. These factors, according to Diepstraten et al. (2003), \\"can seldom be formalized in a simple algorithm, But the properties of cutaway can be distinguish in two classes of cutaways of a drawing\\": * cutout : illustrations where the cutaway is restricted to very simple and regularly shaped of often only a small number of planar slices into the outside object. * breakaway : a cutaway realized by a single hole in the outside of the object.  Examples  Some more examples of cutaway drawings, from products and systems to architectural building.

From the State Archives of Upper Austria in Linz The Theater auf der Wieden, also called the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden or the Wiednertheater, was a theater located in the then- suburban Wieden district of Vienna in the late 18th century. It existed for only 14 years (1787‚Äì1801), but during this time it was the venue for the premiere of no fewer than 350 theatrical works,Krzeszowiak (2009, 69) of which the most celebrated was Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. During most of this period the director of the theater was Emanuel Schikaneder, remembered today as librettist and impresario of The Magic Flute. Origin The \\"Freihaus\\" was a large complex of businesses and residences belonging to the Starhemberg family. It was located at the northern edge of the Wiedner suburb, separated from the inner city by the \\"Glacis\\", the ring of open land that surrounded inner Vienna for purposes of military defense. The Freihaus attracted intensive development because by an earlier Imperial decree (1647) it was free from taxation.Krzeszowiak (2009, 43). The exemption held good for the Starhembergs, not their tenants; presumably the heavy development of the complex occurred because the untaxed Starhembergs could offer lower rents. The complex was called the \\"Starhembergische Freihaus\\" (\\"free-house of the Starhembergs\\"), from which was derived the name \\"Freihaus-Theater\\".Buch (2007, ix) Christian Rossbach, a theater director who had already been successfully mounting productions in Vienna for several years,Krzeszowiak (2009, 74) made an application to build a new theater in the Freihaus. This was approved 16 March 1787,Krzeszowiak (2009, 74) and construction began, following a design by the architect Andreas Zach. The building was completed within six months and was opened for its first performance on 14 October.Krzeszowiak (2009, 78) Structure The theater was a three-story structure having a divided parterre (ground level) and two galleries (balconies). The external walls and roof were of brick and the interior was of wood. According to Krzeszowiak the theater had \\"very good acoustics\\".Krzeszowiak (2009, 81). Krzeszowiak does not give his source for this description. No description of the theater's capacity survives. The dimensions of the theater were 30 by 15 meters;Lorenz (2008:4). All page references to Lorenz are from the web-posted version. Buch judges that the theater must have held over 500 spectators;Buch (2007, ix) Kurt Honolka estimates 800, then 1000 following an expansion carried out by Emanuel Schikaneder.Honolka (1990, 76) The stage area was substantial, forming 12 meters of the 30 meter length of the building. Honolka judges that it was \\"planned from the beginning for opulent scenic design.\\"Honolka (1990, 76), also Lorenz (2008:4) Examining the plays and librettos of Emanuel Schikaneder, Buch infers \\"a mechanical stage with three trap doors, movable flats and backdrops, and devices to accommodate flying machines, storms, sea battles, and similar effects.\\"Buch (2007, ix) Performance history The founding director was Christian Rossbach, who served from October 1787 to March 1788. Rossbach's venture lasted only a few months and ended in financial failure, despite a dispensation from the Emperor to perform during Lent. He first tried playing in cheaper venues in Vienna, then left Vienna with half of his troupe to play the provinces in Moravia.Krzeszowiak (2009, 83) Rossbach was succeeded by Johann Friedel, who ran the productions from March 1788 to his death in March 1789. Friedel worked in collaboration with his lover Eleonore Schikaneder, the estranged wife of Friedel's former theatrical colleague Emanuel Schikaneder. Like Rossbach Friedel was unable to make the theater a success, despite making improvements to the property and mounting as many as nine productions within a period of two weeks; Honolka comments that \\"they can scarcely have been properly rehearsed.\\"Honolka (1990, 76) Following Friedel's death, Eleonore reconciled with her husband and invited him to take on the directorship,Honolka (1990, 59) which he held from July 1789 until the theater's closure in June 1801.Krzeszowiak (2009, 7-8). Schikaneder created a new troupe partly from the participants in Friedel's ensemble, and partly from personnel he brought with him from his former troupe, playing in Regensburg. The company offered \\"mostly German operas and plays with songs and incidental music (tragedies, comedies, and spectacles with elaborate stage machinery)\\".Buch 1997, 198. The company staged Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail in April and May 1789.Buch 1997, 197 Starting in 1789, Schikaneder's company staged a series of fairy tale operas. These included Der Stein der Weisen (The Philosopher's Stone), a collaboratively written work to which Mozart contributed a small portion of the music (see Benedikt Schack). The fairy tale series culminated with the premiere in September 1791 of Mozart's The Magic Flute. The latter was a success, and played for over 100 performances in its first year alone, 223 over the life of the theater.Yates (1995, 19) It gave rise to a sequel by Schikaneder and Peter von Winter (1798) entitled The Magic Flute Second Part. The theater continued to be used for opera until 1801,Grove opera dictionary, \\"Wieden\\" when Schikaneder moved the troupe to his newly built Theater an der Wien.Grove opera dictionary, \\"Vienna\\" Prince Starhemberg, an efficient businessman, promptly tore down the old theater and replaced it with apartment housing.Lorenz (2008:9) The roof tiles were reinstalled on the parish church of Perchtoldsdorf, where they can be seen to this day ().Lorenz (2008:11) Scholarly opinion Published opinion concerning the theater has evolved, raising the estimation of the quality of the building and the performances therein. This rise in its estimate has paralleled shifts in Mozart biography, as the field shifts away from the traditional assessment of Mozart's later life as wretched and despairing.Specifically, it was presented as part of Mozart's decline that he was reduced to writing for a grossly inferior theater not affiliated with the court. Concerning the building, testimony from the early Romantic era is preserved in the writings of Ignaz von Seyfried (1776‚Äì1841), who was the musical director of the theater from 1798 to 1801; he continued in this role at the Theater an der Wien until 1826. In 1840, he wrote a contribution to the Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik (12/46, 5 June 1840) in which he described the Theater an der Wieden in rather derogatory terms: \\"... for that limited venue, not much better than a wooden shack [German Holzbude], Mozart composed his immortal Magic Flute\\".Buch 2005 As modern research has shown, this description is entirely false; see in particular Lorenz (2008). Of the legend, Kurt Honolka writes: > The loss of prestige which Schikaneder suffered at the end of the 19th > century also extended to \\"his\\" theater. Of course, its simple structure > could not measure up to the palatial court or civic \\"New Renaissance\\" > buildings then being built. But it was of solid stone, with a tiled roof. > The interior was made of wood, as was usual at the time.Honolka (1990:75) Modern notes written for concert programs and recordings often still perpetuate the \\"shack\\" legend.Examples can be viewed on line: , Traditional views also asserted that the standard of musical execution in the theater was poor; this for instance is the view taken in Hermann Abert's influential Mozart biography. The modern scholar David Buch, who had access to more historical materials than Abert, offers a different assessment: > Another myth about this theater has also persisted in modern literature, > namely, that the music was of an inferior quality and that the performances > were rather crude. While there is one derisive review of a performance at > the Theater auf der Wieden by a north German commentator in 1793, most > contemporary reviews were positive, noting a high standard of musical > performance.

Born in Paris in 1460 or 1470, he is the son of Geoffroy d'Estienne and Laure de Montolivet. His brother Raimond d'Estienne became the heir of the Estienne family, while Henri was disinherited by his father in 1482 \\"for having devoted himself to printing\\", the profession of printer then being the cause of losing your title. Estienne established the Estienne printing firm in 1502 from his wife's deceased husband's Higman Press. After his death in 1520, his wife married his colleague Simon de Colines who took control of the Estienne Press until his son Robert Estienne assumed control of the press in 1526. Life Henri Estienne was born in Paris in 1460 or 1470;; ; . Estienne married Guyonne Viart and became the director of the Higman press in 1502, which her deceased husband Jean Higman owned. He likely began printing in between 1502 and 1503, and Estienne's first work was a Latin translation of Aristotle's Ethics in 1503 or 1504. However, Estienne's works were primarily theological or scientific. He printed the Abr√©g√© de l'Arithm√©tique of Boethius in 1503.; The Estienne printing studio was established on rue de l'ecole de Droit, where Estienne was printer- bookseller for the University of Paris. Estienne's printmark was of the old arms of the University, a shield charged with three Fleurs de Lis, with a hand emerging from a cloud and holding a closed bookH. Harrisse, Discovery and development map of New Found Land and Surrounding Countries, 1497-1501-1769. with the motto was: Plus olei quam vini (\\"more oil than wine,\\").Thomas, Joseph. Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology. Lippincott, Philadelphia (1870). One of Estienne's frequent authors was Jacques Lef√®vre d'√âtaples; Estienne published his Psalterium quintuplex in 1509, his commentaries on Psalms in 1507, and commentaries on the Epistles of Paul in 1512. Moreover, these works represented one of the first instances in which the Bible was studied philologically. In addition to Estienne's collaboration with Lef√®vre d'√âtaples, Estienne had connections with Guillaume Bud√© and Guillaume Bri√ßonnet. Beatus Rhenanus served as one of Estienne's proofreaders. Estienne took great care to avoid printing errors in his work. If any mistake occurred, he would use errata sheets to correct the error and may have been the first printer to do so. Additionally, Estienne usually indicated on his prints that they were for sale at his printing press, a practice not often followed by his son Robert Estienne. Estienne's typography became increasingly more sophisticated by the late 1510s, more similar to the books Simon de Colines would print after Estienne's death. Estienne died in 1520. By 1520, de Colines was probably his personal assistant and therefore replaced Estienne as print director. Scholars suspect that de Colines's instant proficiency as print director of the Estienne's business suggests that he was involved with the Estienne print shop. However, there is no evidence to suggest he had ties to the shop until he assumed control of it in 1520. Along with de Colines, Estienne helped to move the printing type style from gothic to roman. Philippe Renouard attributed the Estienne print shop with publishing over 1590 editions (an average of nine per year) from 1502 to 1664. Publications Henri Estienne's publishing company published five to ten handmade books per year. Among his publications were the editions of Aristotle, and the Psalterium quincuplex, of Lef√®vre d'Estaples, 1509 & 1513, and his commentary on the Pauline Epistles in 1512. Also the Itinerarium of Antoninus, 1512; Guillaume Mara, and De Tribusfagiendis. Estienne also published an influential print of Materia medica, translated by Jean Ruel, in 1516. Estienne used a unique, distinctive font for this publication, indicating that it was a favored project of Estienne. Family Henri Estienne had sons, Fran√ßois, Robert, and Charles. All of his sons were connected to Estienne's profession in some manner, but Robert was most directly tied to his father's profession and ran his father's business after he died. Fran√ßois became a bookseller for the University of Paris, occasionally dabbling in publishing. He published in between 1537 and 1548; however, unlike his father, none of his works were related to theology. His widow Guyonne Viart married Simon de Colines, a remarkable printer of the 16th century. He likely worked for Estienne's publishing company while Estienne was still alive. Charles Estienne was a medical scholar, even publishing some works related to medicine and natural history. After his brother, Robert Estienne fled Paris for Geneva in 1550 because of threats from the Sorbonne after he converting to Protestantism, Charles took charge of the Estienne print shop in Paris. Charles published in Paris until 1561, many of which works were small editions of various Hebrew texts. Footnotes Citations References       *Schreiber, Fred.

Horton's core area of research is plasma transport and its application to the development of nuclear fusion power. Horton is a fellow of the American Physical Society. Biography Claude Wendell Horton Jr. was born in Houston, Texas, the son of Claude Wendell Horton Sr. who was one of the principal contributors to the development of the Department of Physics at the University of Texas, Austin. Horton attended Austin High School (Austin, Texas) where he met Elisabeth Alice Becker in a physics class. Elisabeth is the daughter of Ernst D. Becker, a cotton trader, who had immigrated to Texas from Germany in 1927. Elisabeth and Wendell were married shortly after graduation from the University of Texas, Austin. Elisabeth and Wendell have two children Mike A. Horton and John W. Horton. Scientific research Horton's interest in nuclear fusion grew during his graduate studies at the University of California at San Diego. Horton was inspired by the enormous potential of controlled fusion reactions to generate cheap, clean, and sustainable Energy on an unprecedented and inexhaustible scale i.e., human generated ‚ÄòStar Power‚Äô. Horton earned his PhD at UCSD under Marshall Rosenbluth, a scientist who had worked on the Manhattan Project and a close prot√©g√© of Edward Teller. Horton has published or edited thirteen books on the theoretical basis for plasma containment and transport, and co-authored over 200 papers. A frequently cited book is ‚ÄúChaos and Structures in Nonlinear Plasmas‚Äù . Beginning in 1987, due to significant declines in US government funding of fusion research as a potential alternative energy source, Horton began to pursue research in space weather and the prediction of solar storms using chaos and plasma theory to model the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is characterized by an extremely collisionless plasma making available new plasma transport regimes well beyond those existing in laboratory plasmas. Solar storm prediction has application for improving the reliability of communication and GPS satellite systems. However, the quest for fusion containment in a laboratory has been the biggest source of contribution and inspiration during his 40-year career in theoretical physics. Recently Horton has focused on research in support of international fusion experiments including the ITER and Gamma10 fusion machines.

His father was the sexton and singer of the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-over-de-Dijle church in Mechelen. His received his musical training at the St. Rumbolds Cathedral in Mechelen. The choirmaster of the Cathedral was Theo Verelst, who was also the teacher of Philippus de Monte and Cypriano de Rore. Episcopius studied from 1538 to 1541 at the University of Leuven and became a priest. From 1545 to 1565 and from 1577 to 1585, he was choirmaster at the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht. He was replaced by Jean de Chayn√©e. When his successor de Chayn√©e was assassinated, Episcopius was reinstated in his former position. Around 1582, he moved from the Low Countries to Munich where in 1584 he became a singer in the choir that was led by Orlando di Lasso. He retired in 1591 and became a canon in Straubing.

She was also a British suffragette and paid member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).  Early life  Rona Robinson (front row) pictured in her 1905 graduating class photo. Photo courtesy of the School of Chemistry, University of Manchester Rona Robinson was born on 26 June 1884. She was the youngest child of Jessie and Fred (Alfred) Robinson, both of her parents originating from the Manchester area, from Chorlton-on- Medlock and Cheetham Hill respectively. She was from a working-class background, her father is listed as cotton goods traveller.1881 Census Robinson's childhood was spent in the Gorton and Withington areas of Manchester, growing up with her sister Lilian (b. 1880) and brother Andrew (b. 1882). Her father died when Robinson was young and her mother took in lodgers to make ends meet. In the 1891 census, Jessie is registered as a widow and lodging house keeper living with her three children and two visitors, one from Liverpool and one from Syria.1891 census Robinson attended one of the Manchester Central Schools.Manchester Central Schools. Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 21 July 1905 In 1900, at the age of 15, she was awarded a junior science exhibition to the value of ¬£15 per annum by Lancashire County Council, this funding allowed her to continue studying well beyond the traditional school leaving age. Robinson gained a scholarship to study at Owens College, Manchester (incorporated into the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904), matriculating in 1902. Here she excelled; appearing in the list of first class students for the Owens College examinations sessions of 1902‚Äì03 (her first year) as 3rd equal in her class in organic chemistry.Owens College examinations sessions 1902-3. Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 27 June 1903. She graduated with a first class honours degree in chemistry, the LeBlanc medal and a Mercer scholarship (for the best final year student entering research) in 1905. She was the first woman in the United Kingdom to gain a first-class degree in chemistry. Robinson continued at Manchester, working for her research MSc during which she published a paper entitled 3-Hydroxyphthalic and 3-methoxyphthalic acids and their derivatives with William Henry Bentley and Charles (Chaim) Weitzmann.J. Chem. Soc., Trans., 1907,91, 104‚Äì112 https://doi.org/10.1039/CT9079100104 She graduated with her MSc in 1907.  Suffragette  After university, Robinson became a teacher at Altrincham Pupil-Teacher Centre, Cheshire, where Dora Marsden (later editor of The Freewoman) was assistant-mistress and later headmistress. Whilst at Altrincham, Robinson and Marsden developed a mutual interest in women's suffrage. Both left the school after a dispute over wages to concentrate their attention on Women's Social and Political Union activities, becoming paid regional representatives. Robinson and fellow suffragette Mary Gawthorpe gave eulogia at the unfurling of the Manchester WSPU banner in Stevenson Square, Manchester, in June 1908.Manchester Courier, Monday, 22 June 1908 (The banner is now displayed at the People's History Museum, Manchester). Marsden and Robinson were appointed organisers from the Manchester branch in 1909 but quickly moved to other locations for much of their work.Cowman, K., The Militant Suffrage Movement in York, p. 35. Marsden and Robinson were imprisoned for a month for obstruction and assault after taking part in a deputation to see the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith in 1909. Robinson's address was given as Brinslea Villas, Brook Road, Fallowfield Manchester. A journalist William Hutcheon was also arrested for obstruction. In October 1909 Robinson, Marsden and Gawthorpe were arrested for dressing in full academic regalia and interrupting a speech by the chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester at the celebration of the opening of the new chemical laboratories. They were demanding that the chancellor speak out against the force-feeding of imprisoned suffragette alumni of Manchester who were on hunger strike. The police were particularly rough with the women that day and the chancellor was sufficiently moved by the women's protest to pressure the university into not pressing charges, thus preventing Rona from going to prison again. Hunger strike Robinson was imprisoned several times and there are 2 dates on her suffrage medal showing she went on hunger strike during her imprisonment. This was a deliberate tactic by the WSPU where women refused all food and water when they arrived at prison and then would eventually have to be discharged on medical grounds. Robinson's Hunger Strike Medal given by WSPU is described as follows: \\"The circular silver medal is inscribed \\"HUNGER STRIKE\\" on the front and \\"RONA ROBINSON\\" on the obverse. The bars are inscribed in descending order \\"FOR VALOUR\\", \\"OCTOBER 15th 1909\\" and \\"AUGUST 20th 1909. The two bars signify two separate arrests and hunger strikes that Rona endured for her cause. On the obverse of the top bar is the maker's name and address \\"TOYE 57 THEABOLD RD LONDON\\" it is believed that no more than 100 of the medals were awarded; there is no answer to how many have survived.\\" Sources suggest Robinson's medal was sold to a private collector in the USA.  Critic of domestic science  Robinson had been outspoken on feminist matters during her years as a suffragette, giving a talk in the Freewoman Discussion Circle on the Abolition of Domestic Drudgery. Robinson was a Gilchrist postgraduate scholar in Home Science and Economics at King‚Äôs College for Women in 1912. It is unclear why she took the scholarship given that she already had a postgraduate degree. She resigned her scholarship, citing that the course offered was \\"worthless from an educational point of view\\".The Freewoman, 1912, Vol 1 No 13 p. 256 > ‚Äúwomen must realize that knowledge of pure science, and the power to apply > it, are chiefly in the hands of men, and to men they must appeal for > application of science to the household, unless they themselves are prepared > to become serious scientists‚Äù She wrote extensively on her criticism of the study of domestic science, particularly in feminist publications.  Life in chemistry  Robinson is considered to be one of the first documented female research chemists. In the 8 years following her graduation from Manchester she researched dyes in a private laboratory at her home in Mitford Rd, Withington. She joined W.B. Sharpe in 1915 as an analytical and research chemist. Her work also included responsibility for transferring chemical reactions she had devised to large- scale production. She was promoted to Chief Chemist in 1916 and become an associate of the Institute of Chemistry in 1919. In 1920 she joined Clayton Aniline as Chief Chemist, her work there generated three patents listing her as the inventor; two were for aldehyde-amino condensation products. She stayed at Clayton Aniline until her retirement.  Later life  Rona died on 7 April 1962 at the age of 77. In 1965, a legacy in her will established the Rona Robinson scholarship to support female postgraduate students in chemistry at the Victoria University of Manchester (this transferred to the University of Manchester in 2004University of Manchester Bill, House of Commons, Schedule 2, Section 5.

The inhabitants presumably got their water from the nearby Angerborn spring, a spring that still exists to this day. At present, the Nievoldhagen area is under the care of German forest services.  The legend of Nievoldhagen The legend of Nievoldhagen tells of a time when three swine herders from Eschenrode, H√∂rsingen and Behnsdorf shepherded their animals where the settlement used to be. One of the swines had uncovered the Nievoldhagen church bell while digging for food. The herders could not agree on whose swine it was that uncovered the bell, as the owner of this swine's village would keep the church bell. To settle their differences the herders agreed that whoever could transport the bell to their village first got to keep it. Each ran off towards their homes. The shepherd from Eschenrode caught a stroke of good luck and met a fellow villager with a carriage immediately upon exiting the woods. He told him what had happened and so the bell ended up in Eschenrode. Today the bell still hangs alongside the two modern day church bells in the church of Eschenrode and sounds every day at six o'clock.

By a combination of improvements to existing waterways and the construction of new links a circular route between Lincoln, Peterborough, Ely and Boston is planned. The project is being organised by the Environment Agency and financed from the Regional Development Agency and the European Union. A separate, complementary waterway is the Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway, opening up a route for broader beam boats between The Fens and the rest of Britain's canal network. New Cuts The Environment Agency has obtained a \\"significant proportion\\" of the ¬£8m required for phase one. Starting from the north, the first development was the provision of a new tidal lock from the Haven in Boston to the South Forty-Foot Drain at the Black Sluice, opened to traffic on 20 March 2009. Funding for phase two of the project, which will involve widening of the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to a new road crossing under the A151 road, a new lock and a junction with the River Glen, a tributary of the River Welland, at Guthram Gowt has been secured from the East Midlands Development Agency.Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, Newsletter, March 2008 To connect the Glen to the Welland requires a new tidal lock at the Surfleet Sluices and reconstruction of the tidal Fulney Lock in the River Welland, leading to Spalding. Another major innovation will be a new cut between the Welland, probably at Peakirk and the River Nene downstream of Peterborough, costing at least ¬£20m and probably using the Folly River and part of either Car Dyke or Cat's Water Drain, entering the Nene near Flag Fen. From here the link will follow the existing Middle Levels through Whittlesey Dyke, King's Dyke and Vermuyden's Drain (Forty Foot Drain) to Chatteris. To avoid the existing troublesome crossing from Salter's Lode to Denver Lock a new lock would probably be provided from Vermuyden's Drain into the Old Bedford River at Welches Dam, and thence to the Great Ouse at Earith, though another possibility is to use Fenton's Lode to avoid most of the tidal section. The completion of the project would be the long-discussed Bedford and Milton Keynes Waterway canal between Bedford and Milton Keynes following the course of the Great Ouse and joining the Grand Union Canal, mooted as the \\"first new canal in over a century\\". The funding for this is slowly appearing and as well as providing for the first time an inland route for broader boats‚Äîup to wide‚Äîbetween the north and south of England, it would also serve as a flood relief channel for new developments in the areas through which it is to pass through. This extra benefit may release funding from wider sources. Adaptation of existing locks and bridges would be necessary to increase the dimensions to Grand Union Canal gauge, both in width and air draft. =Precursors= Although using a slightly different route, there are echoes of plans made in 1809 to link the waterways. Two schemes were proposed, one which would have created a canal from Stamford to the Oakham Canal, due west, with a link from Stamford to the Nene at Peterborough, and a connection from near Market Deeping on the Welland, and a rival scheme to link Stamford to the Grand Junction Canal, both of which included a connection to the South Forty-Foot Drain. Both were put before Parliament in 1811, but neither met with any success. The idea was raised again in 1815 and 1828, but no further action was taken.Hadfield (1970), p.97 Gallery Image:Fens waterways.pngProposed route File:Black Sluice Boston.jpgBlack Sluice Lock, where the South Forty- Foot Drain joins The Haven at Boston Image:Geograph 215184.jpgThe South Forty-Foot Drain at Pointon, between Boston and Guthram Gowt.

K. Simmons. Pope is the Assistant Chief for Operations of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). Pope, along with Commander Taylor, is one of two characters on the show who has a real-life equivalent, in this case Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger, Director and Commanding Officer of Office of Operations, Los Angeles Police Department. Despite bringing Brenda Leigh Johnson in for the job, he doesn't seem to want to let her actually do her work. He had an extramarital affair with Johnson when they worked together in Washington, DC. After he ended it, he divorced his first wife to marry a woman named Estelle, who eventually divorced him. This history causes some personal tension between the two of them. In season six, Pope expects to be on the short list to become the new Chief of Police but discovers he is not being considered. When Tommy Delk is named Chief, Pope is assigned to the traffic division and considers quitting the force. When Delk suddenly dies, Pope is named Interim Chief, to the surprise of many. Pope seems to still harbor feelings for Johnson, and he acts jealous of her relationship with Fritz Howard. By the beginning of Major Crimes, Pope has become the Chief of Police on a permanent basis. He promotes Russell Taylor to his old position of Assistant Chief. Though both men promised to promote Sharon Raydor to the rank of Commander if she took over Major Crimes, this is revealed to have been a lie and that the new position itself is her promotion. In Major Crimes, Pope is not seen and is rarely mentioned with Assistant Chief Taylor acting as the supervisor of the Major Crimes Division. Pope also makes it clear to Provenza through Taylor that Provenza's choices are to either retire or deal with Sharon as Pope refuses to transfer him. In season 5 of Major Crimes, Taylor is murdered in a courtroom shootout, leaving Pope to find a new Assistant Chief. A competition develops between Deputy Chief Winnie Davis, Commander Leo Mason and Captain Sharon Raydor for the position. After Davis' behavior nearly screws up a case in \\"Shockwave, Part 1,\\" Pope is stated in \\"Shockwave, Part 2\\" to have sent her to a leadership conference and replaced her liaison role in the case with Fritz Howard. At the end of \\"Shockwave, Part 2,\\" Pope promotes Leo Mason to the role of Assistant Chief and Mason promotes Sharon Raydor to the rank of Commander, the promotion that she had long ago been promised by Pope and Taylor but denied. Personality Pope commands the authority of his team, and the department detectives generally respect him. Closing cases and convicting criminals is his first priority, even if it means he has to take the heat from his superiors. He always defends his team and is more than willing to take the blame for them. Pope can be something of a chameleon, often playing both sides of the fence to get what he wants. Unlike Brenda, he plays along with law enforcement politics in order to keep the department running smoothly. Although he can be overly controlling, he has a soft spot for Brenda and is always eager to please her. When she first transfers to the LAPD, for example, Pope readily defends her against the other detectives' complaints, and he is often fiercely protective of her.

It was introduced in place of the School Certificate in 1951 as part of an educational reform alongside the more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (official title of qualification: General Certificate of Education ‚Äì Advanced Level) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those three jurisdictions replaced O Levels gradually with General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams over time. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade). The O Level qualification is still awarded by CIE Cambridge International Examinations, the international counterpart of the British examination Board OCR (Oxford, Cambridge & Royal Society of Arts), in select locations, instead of or alongside the International General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications. Both CIE and OCR have Cambridge Assessment as their parent organisation. The Cambridge O Level has already been phased out, however, and is no longer available in certain administrative regions. Current usage =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, the O Level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) under the board of British Council. O Level qualification has become a replacement for the matriculation qualification (SSC) offered by the Government boards of education. However, due to the high costs associated with O Level qualifications, their reach is limited to middle to elite class families. =Brunei= In Brunei, the O Level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). A number of subjects, including English Language, Bahasa Melayu (Malay language), Malay Literature, Islamic Religious Knowledge, Ulum al-Quran, Hafaz al-Quran, Tafsir al-Quran (Asas), History, Geography, Pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Biology), Arabic, Art and Design, offer exam papers and syllabuses unique to Brunei. Additionally, the Mathematics (Syllabus D) subject previously offered an exam paper and a syllabus unique to Brunei, but this has since been retired and the regular syllabus used worldwide is offered. This is equivalent to secondary education now. =India= In India, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) GCE Ordinary Level qualifications are offered at private and international schools as an alternative to the conventional Indian School Certificate (ISC). =Malaysia= In Malaysia, the O Level qualification is offered as the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM, Malaysian Education Certificate), with examinations conducted by the Malaysian Examination Syndicate (Lembaga Peperiksaan Malaysia). The examinations were formerly conducted by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), which still advises the national examination board on standards. The English Language subject was previously offered with an exam paper and a syllabus unique to Malaysia, but this Malaysia-specific qualification has since expired, and the regular English Language exam paper and syllabus used worldwide is now used within the country. The English paper is separately graded by the national examination board and UCLES, and both grades are displayed on the result slip. =Mauritius= In Mauritius, the O Level qualification is awarded as part of the School Certificate, which is awarded upon successful completion of Form V in secondary school. The O Level examinations are jointly conducted by the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The International General Certificate of Secondary Education from Edexcel is also offered as an equivalent alternative qualification, for which exam registration may be done through the Mauritius Examinations Syndicate. A number of subjects, including English Language, English Language (Syllabus B), History, Mathematics (Syllabus A), Mathematics (Syllabus D), offer exam papers and syllabuses unique to Mauritius. Additionally, the subject of Art and Design, the offering of which is restricted to a limited geographic region, is available in Mauritius. =Pakistan= The GCE O Level qualification is offered in Pakistan by the CIE and conducted by the British Council. O Level qualification has become a replacement for the matriculation qualification offered by the Government boards of education. Due to the high costs associated with O Level qualifications, their reach is limited to middle to elite class families. In 2011 Zohaib Asad, a student of the Beaconhouse School System, achieved grade A in a record 28 O-level examinations. =Seychelles= In Seychelles, the O Level qualification is offered, with examinations conducted by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). Some subjects are unique to Seychelles or have a format, curriculum, or syllabus that is unique to Seychelles. =Singapore= In Singapore, the O Level qualification is offered jointly by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) and the Singapore Ministry of Education. The examinations are mainly conducted by CIE, with select subject examinations conducted by the Singapore Ministry of Education, including select mother tongue subjects, such as Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, and humanities subject of Social Studies. A number of subjects previously offered exam papers and syllabuses unique to Singapore, but these have since been retired or planned to be phased out. After taking O-levels, some Singapore students go on to GCE Advanced Level exams, which are also marked by Cambridge International Examinations. In 2024, the O levels as well as the N levels will be phased out for a new local examination. =Sri Lanka= The GCE Ordinary Level qualification is offered by the British council of Sri Lanka School (BCS). Before, this qualification was jointly offered by Cambridge International Examinations and the Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka. =Zimbabwe= The GCE Ordinary Level qualification is offered by the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (ZIMSEC). Before, this qualification was jointly offered by Cambridge International Examinations and the Ministry of Education in Zimbabwe. Former usage =Caribbean= The O Level qualification was previously awarded in the Caribbean. However, many Caribbean countries have now switched to awarding Caribbean Secondary Education Certification (CSEC) qualifications based on successful completion of examinations administered by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC). =Hong Kong= The O Level qualification was previously awarded in Hong Kong, along with the Hong Kong version of the A Level qualification. However, this was replaced with the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) which was then replaced with the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). The HKCEE was previously benchmarked against the O Levels for comparable subjects, but with the introduction of the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) qualification the Hong Kong equivalent qualification was then benchmarked against the IGCSE. =United Kingdom= The GCE O Level qualification originated in the United Kingdom, where it was awarded as the secondary school-leaving qualification. It was primarily an examinations-based qualification, with a grading system that changed over the years. In the United Kingdom, the O Level qualifications were replaced in 1988 with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE).

Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak (Hebrew: ◊®◊ë ◊†◊ó◊û◊ü ◊ë◊® ◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß; died 356 CE) was a Babylonian rabbi, of the fourth and fifth generations of amoraim. It is generally accepted that references to \\"Rav Nachman\\" in the Talmud refer to Rav Nachman bar Yaakov, not to Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak.Tosafot to Gittin 31b takes this position while understanding Rashi as disagreeing. Modern scholarship follows Tosafot, noting that \\"Rav Nachman\\" and \\"Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak\\" are often stated as disagreeing within a single passage. Biography His mother's brother was Rav Aha bar Yosef.Shabbat 140a Legend states that an astrologer predicted to his mother that her son would become a thief. She required him to have his head covered at all times, though he did not understand the purpose of this requirement. Once he was sitting and studying under a tree, and his head- covering slipped off. He was overcome by desire and took cluster of dates from the tree (which did not belong to him).Shabbos 156b He was a disciple of Abaye, Rava, Rav Nachman,Gittin 31a and Rav Chisda.Eruvin 43b In his youth he studied together with Rava, sitting one row behind Rava in the beit midrash and occasionally asking each other questions.Eruvin 43b; Bava Batra 152a Later on, while Rav Yosef was the head of the yeshivah of Pumbedita, Rava became the head of the yeshivah in Mechoza, while Nachman bar Yitzchak was appointed the chief lecturer (Reish Kallah) under Rava.Bava Batra 22a He later went to Sura, where Rav Nahman bar Chisda drew particular attention to him and frequently repeated his responsa in the beit midrash.Hullin 88b; Shevuot 12b; Ta'anit 21b When Rava died, he succeeded Rava as head of the school (which was transferred from Mahoza to Pumbedita), a position he held for four years.Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon, 3:3 Teachings =Halakha= He contributed to halakhah chiefly by collecting, arranging, and transmitting the teachings and decisions of his predecessors, which were thus saved from oblivion. He also employed mnemonics to facilitate memorizing the halakhot which he had arranged,Shabbat 33a, 60b; Taanit 10a; Yabamot 21a; Avodah Zarah 28a; Hullin 106a; Arachin 11a; Niddah 45a thus beginning the redaction of the Talmud. He distinctly recognized his position regarding halakhah, saying of himself \\"I am neither a sage nor a seer, nor even a scholar as contrasted with the majority. I am a transmitter and a codifier, and the beit ha-midrash follows me in its decisions.\\"Pesachim 105b He taught that a person who follows Beit Shammai in halacha \\"deserves death\\" - in contrast to Rav Yehezkel who says such a person \\"has acted [i.e., has fulfilled his obligation]\\", and in accord with Rav Yosef who says such a person \\"has done nothing.\\"Berakhot 11a The honor of the Sabbath was of great importance to him. He would personally do menial work in its honor.Shabbat 119a He would say that \\"one who honors the Sabbath is saved from the oppression of the exile\\".Shabbat 118b =Aggadah= He appears frequently in aggadah as one who arranges and explains the words of other authorities, and he frequently cites Biblical passages in support of their teachings.Arachin 33a When the interpretations by others deviate from the Masoretic vocalization, he attempts to show that reference to the written form of the word in question allows such varying explanations.Yoma 38b, 75b He often interprets rare or ambiguous terms in the Mishnah by citing analogous passages.Beitzah 35b; Yoma 32b In addition, he also had many independent teachings of his own, including: * \\"Why is wisdom likened to a tree?Proverbs 3:18 Because just as a tiny piece of wood kindles a large one, so the minor Torah scholar sharpens the great scholar.\\"Ta'anit 7a * \\"Whoever enjoys a wedding meal and gladdens the groom, it is as if he built one of the ruins of Jerusalem.\\"Brachot 6b * \\"Greater is a sin for the sake of Heaven than the fulfillment of a commandment that is not for the sake of heaven\\".Nazir 23b; Horayot 10b This statement is seen as a justification for the actions of Lot's daughters who had sex with Lot to maintain humanity,Genesis 19 Tamar who pretended to be a prostitute to establish the line of her late husband,Genesis 38 and Yael who (according to the rabbis) had sex with Sisera before killing him.Judges 4-5 He condemned arroganceSotah 5a and anger.Nedarim 22b When Rava stated that a little pride is becoming a scholar, Nachman replied, \\"Neither it, nor part of it!\\"Sotah 5a He had a sense of wit, and often played on the name of a tanna who brought baraitot before him.Berachot 39b, 53b; Gittin 41a He also frequently employed proverbs.Yoma 86a; Shabbat 54a; Sotah 22a References It has the following bibliography: * Hamburger, R.

Implementation  Its implementation is based on the TIA-569-B ‚ÄúPathways and Spaces‚Äù technical standard, which defines the Telecommunications Enclosure (TE), and TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Addendum 5, which defines the cabling when a TE is used. The FTTE architecture allows for many media choices from the TE to the work area; it may be balanced twisted pair copper, multi-mode optical fiber, or even wireless if an access point is installed in or near the TE. Depending on the user‚Äôs needs, FTTE can be deployed in low-density or high- density configurations. A low-density system might use one or two inexpensive 8-port Ethernet mini-switches as an example (these switches have eight 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet copper ports and one 1 Gbit/s Ethernet fiber uplink). A high- density FTTE design might use commonly available 24- or 48-port switches (these switches are configured with one 1 Gbit/s uplink port per twelve 100BASE-TX user ports). This relatively high work area-to-backbone port ratio provides better performance than is typically provided to enterprise users.

It is related to the sawtoothed grain beetle. Description  The foreign grain beetle is approximately 2 mm ( in) in length. It can be distinguished chiefly by slight projections or knobs on each front corner of the pronotum, and its club-shaped antennae. The larvae are worm-like, cream- colored and often reach a length of 3 mm before pupating into darker adults. Males and females are identical in appearance both as larvae and adults. The adult is usually reddish brown, or sometimes black.  Natural history  = Distribution = The foreign grain beetle is found in tropical and temperate regions. It can complete development at temperatures between 20 and 35 ¬∞C. = Behavior = The beetle can only survive if relative humidity exceeds 70%, so it emerges in higher-humidity conditions. Its diet is entirely fungi. It can often be found in grain storage facilities, where it feeds on the mold growing on the grain. It can be found in other moist locations such as the walls of houses around plumbing systems. = Life cycle = The adult female can begin laying eggs around 3 to 4 days after emerging from the pupa. It can lay up to 8 or 12 eggs per day, but generally produces 1 to 4. Eggs are laid singly or in clusters of two or three, and they hatch in 4 to 5 days. The larval stage is completed in 11 to 19 days, and pupation takes 3 to 5 days. Larval development takes longer in drier conditions. Mated males have an average life span of 159 days, and mated females live about 208 days. Unmated beetles live longer, males up to 275 days, and females up to 300.  Impact on humans  The beetle is harmless. It may inhabit dwellings and infest products such as grains, cereals, oilseeds, dried fruit, and spices, particularly if the product is moldy. The presence of the beetle is a good indicator of damp storage conditions and spoiled food.Weaver, D. 2004. Foreign Grain Beetle - Stored Grain. High Plains IPM Guide. University of Wyoming, University of Nebraska, Colorado State University, and Montana State University. It does not damage the food itself, or any structures.  Control  The beetle is controlled by eliminating damp habitat. Insecticides may be used but must be applied frequently and it does not reach beetles inside grain kernels. Diatomacous earth has also been used. = Biological control = Various insect predators and parasitic wasps attack this beetle. They are only effective in large numbers. They are rarely used in the United States because live insect biological pest control agents are not permitted in stores of in raw grain.  References   External links  *Foreign Grain Beetles.

He was born in Mannheim, Germany. Early career Rohr, known primarily by his nickname \\"Ossi\\", began his career in the 1920s as a striker for hometown clubs FC Ph√∂nix Mannheim and later for VfR Mannheim. He was quickly marked as a talented striker with a natural instinct for scoring goals. Fueled by the desire to display his talents at a higher level, he signed with FC Bayern Munich in 1930. In his first season with FC Bayern, Rohr and his teammates barely missed out on the final round of the German Championship. In his second season with the club, FC Bayern went on to defeat Eintracht Frankfurt in the final and claim its first German Championship with a 2‚Äì0 victory. Ossi Rohr, who scored one of the two goals in the match against Eintracht, was German Champion at the young age of 20 years. The following year, Bayern's fortunes were significantly poorer, resulting in a mid-table finish within Bavaria. This lackluster finish encouraged Rohr to continue his career elsewhere. At the age of 19, Rohr received his first German national team call-up by German manager Otto Nerz. There he found himself on the pitch with stars such as Ernst Kuzorra and Richard Hofmann. He played in a total of four national team matches through March 1933, receiving his first cap a year earlier against Switzerland (2‚Äì0) in March 1932. He later scored two goals in a 4‚Äì3 win against Sweden, one goal in a 1‚Äì3 loss to Italy, and two goals in a 3‚Äì3 draw with France. With five goals in four matches, Rohr looked to be on the verge of a very successful national career. Success Abroad During the summer of 1933, Rohr transferred to Grasshoppers Z√ºrich in the Swiss League, where he would go on to win the Swiss Cup. Although football results were important to him, Rohr's real mission was to earn a living playing football. The pursuit of money convinced him to transfer to French League side Racing Strasbourg. Due to his numerous transfers, football magazine \\"Der Fu√üball\\" referred to Rohr as \\"the Gladiator, whom sells himself abroad.\\" This antagonism towards Rohr only endeared him even more to the press and fans in the Alsace. During the 1934‚Äì35 season, he proved his worth scoring 20 goals in 22 matches while leading Strasbourg to runner-up in the French Championship. The following season Rohr scored at an even higher rate, netting 28 goals in 28 matches. This performance saw him end up second on the French goal scoring list, with Strasbourg finishing third in the league. Although only finishing 6th in the league during the 1936‚Äì37 season, Rohr did obtain a French Cup runners-up medal with Strasbourg, as well as becoming the French League scoring champion with 30 goals. The following season he would finish again in second on the goal scoring list with 25 goals. With 117 Ligue 1 goals, Rohr is still the all-time goal scorer at Racing Strasbourg. He is still fondly remembered by fans of the club. War Years The start of World War II in 1939, as well as the occupation of various parts of France by the German Army in 1940, troubled Rohr and he decided to flee to S√®te in southern, unoccupied France where he live until 1942. During this time, the Third Reich declared him Persona non grata. It is unknown if he played at local club FC S√®te during this time period; he was however, not listed on the players roster during the 1941‚Äì42 season. Additionally disputed is whether Rohr served as a member of the French Foreign Legion between 1940‚Äì1942. In November 1942, he was sentenced to a three-month prison term after his arrest by French police in Marseille for \\"anti-French or communist propaganda.\\" He was handed over to the authorities by his nephew, Philip Rohr. He served his sentence at the Strasbourg Citadel, after which he was handed over to German authorities. The Gestapo interned him in a concentration camp at Karlsruhe-Kieslau; two months later he was sent to the Eastern Front. After arriving at the Eastern Front, Rohr was permitted to join a German Army football team, enabling him to perform the one task he truly enjoyed; scoring goals. Shortly before the end of the war, a German pilot recognized him from his football days and offered him a flight back to Germany. Post war After the war ended, Rohr decided to remain in Germany instead of returning to Strasbourg. Until 1949 he continued to play in the first division of German football (Oberliga S√ºd) for VfR Mannheim (1945‚Äì46, 7 matches, 3 goals), TSV Schwaben Augsburg (1945‚Äì46, 15 matches, 8 goals) and SV Waldhof (1948‚Äì49, 17 matches, 5 goals) as well as for (Oberliga S√ºdwest) FK Pirmasens (1947‚Äì48, 21 matches, 11 goals). At VfR Rohr briefly played in the same side as his nephew Philipp. After his retirement, he worked as a clerk for the Mannheim city prosecutors office. Gernot Rohr, grandnephew of Oskar Rohr, would eventually also play for FC Bayern as well as in the French League with Girondins Bordeaux; Gernot even became a French citizen in 1982 and worked as a football manager until 2005 in the same country where his great uncle, Oskar Rohr, made his name as the greatest goal scorer of the 1930s.

Walter was a son of Erick Roman (born in Finland about 1862) and Selma Coles (born in Finland about 1870). Roman graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1928 with a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering. He married in 1934 and had two daughters. *1928-29 - Roman worked for Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a tester. *1929-31 - Roman was an electrical engineer at Westinghouse in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. *1931-34 - Roman was in charge of the high voltage lab at Westinghouse. *1934-40 - Roman did impulse design engineering at Westinghouse. *1940-41 - Roman was manager of switch and fuse design at Westinghouse. *1942-45 - Roman was manager of calutron uranium isotope separator design for the Manhattan Project under a contract with Westinghouse Electric.. *1945-51 - Roman left Westinghouse and worked for the Mototrol Engineering division in Buffalo, New York. *1951-59 - Roman returned to Westinghouse and was an advisory engineer at Westinghouse's Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in suburban Pittsburgh. *1959-70 - Roman was manager of nuclear reactor engineering for the Nerva Project at the nearby Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory. After September 1942 when General Leslie Groves was appointed as the military director of the Manhattan Project, Groves funded design and construction of a gigantic array of calutrons for separation of uranium isotopes. The US Army Corps of Engineers contracted with several manufacturing companies including Westinghouse Electric then in East Pittsburgh, PA. Westinghouse assigned Walter Roman to be Manager of separator design. Roman, along with the people in his design department and drafting unit (headed by Robert Hile Best) were relocated to Berkeley, California near the Radiation Lab at the University of California, Berkeley where Walter Roman worked with physicists Ernest Lawrence, Robert Lyster Thornton, and Westinghouse physicist Edward Condon. After preliminary calutron designs were tested at Berkeley using Lawrence's cyclotron, Westinghouse began manufacturing calutrons for installation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the Y-12 plant containing hundreds of calutrons was being constructed. In 1943, Walter Roman's design department was relocated to the Oak Ridge plant because numerous redesigns of calutron parts were necessary. In 1963 Walter Roman received a Special Patent Award from Westinghouse. Roman was a member of the American Nuclear Society, a member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and a member of the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics. Roman designed nuclear engine rockets for space capsules, control rods for nuclear reactors, electronic control circuits, and nuclear reactors.  References  American Men & Women of Science.

The earliest documentation of a spherical Earth comes from the ancient Greeks (5th century BC). Since the 600s AD, scholars have supported that view, and by the Early Middle Ages (700‚Äì1500 AD), virtually all scholars maintained the spherical viewpoint. Since the 1400s, belief in a flat Earth among educated Europeans was almost nonexistent. This despite fanciful depictions in art, such as the exterior panels of Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, in which a disc-shaped Earth is shown floating inside a transparent sphere. According to Stephen Jay Gould, \\"there never was a period of 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars, regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now. Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology.\\" Historians of science David Lindberg and Ronald Numbers point out that \\"there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference\\". Historian Jeffrey Burton Russell says the flat- Earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over biological evolution. Russell claims \\"with extraordinary few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the Earth was flat\\", and ascribes popularization of the flat-Earth myth to histories by John William Draper, Andrew Dickson White, and Washington Irving.  History  In Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians, Jeffrey Russell describes the Flat Earth theory as a fable used to impugn pre- modern civilization and creationism. James Hannam wrote: =Early modern period= French dramatist Cyrano de Bergerac in chapter 5 of his Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon (published 2 years posthumously in 1657) quotes St. Augustine as saying \\"that in his day and age the Earth was as flat as a stove lid and that it floated on water like half of a sliced orange.\\"The Other World The Societies and Governments of the Moon, translated by Donald Webb Robert Burton, in his The Anatomy of MelancholySecond Partition, Section 2, Member 3 \\"Air Rectified. With a Digression of the Air\\" The Anatomy of Melancholy wrote: Thus, there is evidence that accusations of Flat Earthism, though somewhat whimsical (Burton ends his digression with a legitimate quotation of St. Augustine: \\"Better doubt of things concealed, than to contend about uncertainties, where Abraham's bosom is, and hell fire\\"), were used to discredit opposing authorities several centuries before the 19th. Another early mention in literature is Ludvig Holberg's comedy Erasmus Montanus (1723). Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants hold it to be flat. He is not allowed to marry his fianc√©e until he cries \\"The Earth is flat as a pancake\\". In Thomas Jefferson's book Notes on the State of Virginia (1784), framed as answers to a series of questions (queries), Jefferson uses the \\"Query\\" regarding religion to attack the idea of state-sponsored official religions. In the chapter, Jefferson relates a series of official erroneous beliefs about nature forced upon people by authority. One of these is the episode of Galileo's struggles with authority, which Jefferson erroneously frames in terms of the shape of the globe:Jefferson, Thomas. Notes on the State of Virginia, Query regarding RELIGION. Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library. =19th century= The 19th century was a period in which the perception of an antagonism between religion and science was especially strong. The disputes surrounding the Darwinian revolution contributed to the birth of the conflict thesis, a view of history according to which any interaction between religion and science would almost inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.David B. Wilson writes about the development of the conflict thesis in \\"The Historiography of Science and Religion\\" . Irving's biography of Columbus In 1828, Washington Irving's highly romanticized biography, A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus, was published and mistaken by many for a scholarly work. In Book II, Chapter IV of this biography, Irving gave a largely fictional account of the meetings of a commission established by the Spanish sovereigns to examine Columbus's proposals. One of his more fanciful embellishments was a highly unlikely tale that the more ignorant and bigoted members on the commission had raised scriptural objections to Columbus's assertions that the Earth was spherical. The issue in the 1490s was not the shape of the Earth, but its size, and the position of the east coast of Asia, as Irving in fact points out. Historical estimates from Ptolemy onward placed the coast of Asia about 180¬∞ east of the Canary Islands.Ptolemy, Geography, book 1:14. Columbus adopted an earlier (and rejected) distance of 225¬∞, added 28¬∞ (based on Marco Polo's travels), and then placed Japan another 30¬∞ further east. Starting from Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, Columbus made Eurasia stretch 283¬∞ to the east, leaving the Atlantic as only 77¬∞ wide. Since he planned to leave from the Canaries (9¬∞ further west), his trip to Japan would only have to cover 68¬∞ of longitude. Columbus mistakenly assumed that the mile referred to in the Arabic estimate of 56‚Öî miles for the size of a degree was the same as the actually much shorter Italian mile of 1,480 meters. His estimate for the size of the degree and for the circumference of the Earth was therefore about 25% too small. The combined effect of these mistakes was that Columbus estimated the distance to Japan to be only about 5,000 km (or only to the eastern edge of the Caribbean) while the true figure is about 20,000 km. The Spanish scholars may not have known the exact distance to the east coast of Asia, but they believed that it was significantly further than Columbus's projection; and this was the basis of the criticism in Spain and Portugal, whether academic or among mariners, of the proposed voyage. The disputed point was not the shape of the Earth, nor the idea that going west would eventually lead to Japan and China, but the ability of European ships to sail that far across open seas. The small ships of the day (Columbus's three ships varied between 20.5 and 23.5 m ‚Äì or 67 to 77 feet ‚Äì in length and carried about 90 men) simply could not carry enough food and water to reach Japan. The ships barely reached the eastern Caribbean islands. Already the crews were mutinous, not because of some fear of \\"sailing off the edge\\", but because they were running out of food and water with no chance of any new supplies within sailing distance. They were on the edge of starvation. What saved Columbus was the unknown existence of the Americas precisely at the point he thought he would reach Japan. His ability to resupply with food and water from the Caribbean islands allowed him to return safely to Europe. Otherwise his crews would have died, and the ships foundered. Advocates for science In 1834, a few years after the publication of Irving's book, Jean Antoine Letronne, a French academic of strong antireligious ideas, misrepresented the church fathers and their medieval successors as believing in a flat Earth in his On the Cosmographical Ideas of the Church Fathers. Then in 1837, the English philosopher of science William Whewell, in his History of the Inductive Sciences, identified Lactantius, author of Institutiones Divinae (c. 310), and Cosmas Indicopleustes, author of Christian Topography (c. 548), as evidence of a medieval belief in a Flat Earth. Lactantius had been ridiculed much earlier by Copernicus in De revolutionibus of 1543 as someone who \\"Speaks quite childishly about the Earth's shape, when he mocks those who declared that the Earth has the form of a globe\\". Other historians quickly followed Whewell, although they could identify few other examples. The American chemist John William Draper wrote a History of the Conflict between Religion and Science (1874), employing the claim that the early Church fathers thought the Earth was flat as evidence of the hostility of the Church to the advancement of science. The story of widespread religious belief in the flat Earth was repeated by Andrew Dickson White in his 1876 The Warfare of Science and elaborated twenty years later in his two-volume History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, which exaggerated the number and significance of medieval flat-Earthers to support White's model of warfare between dogmatic theology and scientific progress. As Draper and White's metaphor of ongoing warfare between the scientific progress of the Enlightenment and the religious obscurantism of the \\"Dark Ages\\" became widely accepted, it spread the idea of medieval belief in the flat Earth. The widely circulated engraving of a man poking his head through the firmament surrounding the Earth to view the Empyrean, executed in the style of the 16th century, was published in Camille Flammarion's L'Atmosph√®re: M√©t√©orologie Populaire (Paris, 1888, p. 163). The engraving illustrates the statement in the text that a medieval missionary claimed that \\"he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met\\". In its original form, the engraving included a decorative border that places it in the 19th century. In later publications, some of which claimed that the engraving dates to the 16th century, the border was removed. = 20th century and onward = Front Cover of Daniel Boorstin's The Discoverers (1983), bearing a copy of the Flammarion engraving Since the early 20th century, a number of books and articles have documented the flat Earth error as one of a number of widespread misconceptions in popular views of the Middle Ages. Both E. M. W. Tillyard's book The Elizabethan World Picture and C. S. Lewis' The Discarded Image are devoted to a broad survey of how the universe was viewed in Renaissance and medieval times, and both extensively discuss how the educated classes knew the world was round. Lewis draws attention to the fact that in Dante's The Divine Comedy about an epic voyage through hell, purgatory, and heaven, the Earth is spherical with gravity being towards the center of the Earth. As the Devil is frozen in a block of ice in the center of the Earth, Dante and Virgil climb down the Devil's torso, but up from the Devil's waist to his feet, as his waist is at the center of the Earth. Jeffrey Burton Russell rebutted the prevalence of belief in the flat Earth in a monograph and two papers. Louise Bishop states that virtually every thinker and writer of the 1000-year medieval period affirmed the spherical shape of the Earth. Although the misconception was frequently refuted in historical scholarship since at least 1920, it persisted in popular culture and in some school textbooks into the 21st century. An American schoolbook by Emma Miller Bolenius published in 1919 has this introduction to the suggested reading for Columbus Day (12 October): Previous editions of Thomas Bailey's The American Pageant stated that \\"The superstitious sailors [of Columbus's crew] ... grew increasingly mutinous ... because they were fearful of sailing over the edge of the world\\"; however, no such historical account is known. A 2009 survey of schoolbooks from Austria and Germany showed that the Flat Earth myth became dominant in the second half of the 20th century and persists in most historical textbooks for German and Austrian schools. As recently as 1983 Daniel Boorstin published a historical survey, The Discoverers, which presented the Flammarion engraving on its cover and proclaimed that \\"from AD 300 to at least 1300 ... Christian faith and dogma suppressed the useful image of the world that had been so ... scrupulously drawn by ancient geographers.\\" Boorstin dedicated a chapter to the flat Earth, in which he portrayed Cosmas Indicopleustes as the founder of Christian geography. The flat Earth model has often been incorrectly supposed to be church doctrine by those who wish to portray the Catholic Church as being anti-progress or hostile to scientific inquiry. This narrative has been repeated even in academic circles, such as in April 2016, when Boston College theology professor and ex-priest Thomas Groome erroneously stated that \\"the Catholic Church never said the Earth is round, but just stopped saying it was flat.\\" The 1937 popular song They All Laughed contains the couplet \\"They all laughed at Christopher Columbus/When he said the world was round\\". In the Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon Hare We Go (1951) Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand the Catholic quarrel about the shape of the Earth; the king states the Earth is flat. In Walt Disney's 1963 animation The Sword in the Stone, wizard Merlin (who has traveled into the future) explains to a young Arthur that \\"man will discover in centuries to come\\" that the Earth is round, and rotates. Historiography of the flat Earth myth Ornamental door (1871) at the US Capitol depicting the Council at Salamanca Historical writers have identified a number of historical circumstances that contributed to the origin and widespread acceptance of the flat-Earth myth. American historian Jeffrey Burton Russell traced the nineteenth-century origins of what he called the Flat Error to a group of anticlerical French scholars, particularly to Antoine-Jean Letronne and, indirectly, to his teachers Jean-Baptiste Gail and Edme Mentelle. Mentelle had described the Middle Ages as twelve ignorant centuries of \\"profound night\\", a theme exemplified by the flat-Earth myth in Letronne's \\"On the Cosmological Opinions of the Church Fathers\\". Historian of science Edward Grant makes a case that the flat-Earth myth developed in the context of a more general assault upon the Middle Ages and upon scholastic thought, which can be traced back to Francesco Petrarch in the fourteenth century. Grant sees \\"one of the most extreme assaults against the Middle Ages\\" in Draper's History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, which appeared a decade before Draper presented the flat-Earth myth in his History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science. Andrew Dickson White's motives were more complex. As the first president of Cornell University, he had advocated that it be established without any religious ties but be \\"an asylum for science\\". In addition, he was a strong advocate for Darwinism, saw religious figures as the main opponents of the Darwinian evolution, and sought to project that conflict of theology and science back through the entire Christian Era. But as some historians have pointed out, the nineteenth-century conflict over Darwinism incorporated disputes over the relative authority of professional scientists and clergy in the fields of science and education. White made this concern manifest in the preface to his History of the Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom, where he explained the lack of advanced instruction in many American colleges and universities by their \\"sectarian character\\". The flat-Earth myth, like other myths, took on artistic form in the many works of art displaying Columbus defending the sphericity of the Earth before the Council of Salamanca. American artists depicted a forceful Columbus challenging the \\"prejudices, the mingled ignorance and erudition, and the pedantic bigotry\\" of the churchmen. Abrams sees this image of a Romantic hero, a practical man of business, and a Yankee go-getter as crafted to appeal to nineteenth-century Americans. Russell suggests that the flat-Earth error was able to take such deep hold on the modern imagination because of prejudice and presentism. He specifically mentions \\"the Protestant prejudice against the Middle Ages for Being Catholic ... the Rationalist prejudice against Judeo-Christianity as a whole\\", and \\"the assumption of the superiority of 'our' views to those of older cultures\\".

In 1994, the story arc was reprinted in PB5, the fifth book compilation of the comic strip series. Maidnapper is a portmanteau of the words \\"maid\\" and \\"kidnapper\\". Synopsis Tiny, Bab and Polgas arrive at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport to meet her Filipino-American cousin Gwen. Gwen is accompanied by Gloria, her Cebuana nanny, who takes an instant liking to Bab, much to his discomfiture and makes a few attempts to get a kiss from him, which he answers with a kick to the chin. Later that evening, Bab serenades Gwen with help from Joboy and Polgas. Tiny and Gloria tell Gwen that she's supposed to pour a bucket of water on the singers; unfamiliar with Filipino customs, Gwen complies. In the succeeding days of her stay, Gwen is immersed in Filipino culture; she is exposed to potholed streets, frequently changed street names, exotic native dishes, including Dagul's \\"Soup Number Five\\", Filipino movies (which she calls \\"typically third world\\"), discusses the merits of communism with Noli, and marvels at the capacity of Filipinos to eat each and every part of the chicken.

Upon entering the bar, the duo run into Debbie and Barbie, who had mistakenly entered the gay bar, thinking it was a restaurant. After exchanging threats of exposure, but later agreeing to keep the incident to themselves, each pair decide to leave but Brosia and Glo stays instead. Glo uses Gwen's Gold card to pay for the bar services; Chipper, their waiter, mistakenly tags them as prospective prey for his kidnap-for-ransom gang upon seeing Gwen's name on the card. Two of the gang's members, Demet and Tangwel, abduct the two and bring them to a safehouse. The kidnappers later call the Sungcal household, demanding a million pesos for the safe return of \\"Gwendolynne Dobson\\". After seeing Gwen safe and sound, the Sungcals determine that it is the maids who had been kidnapped. =Ransom= The Sungcals amass the ransom money by selling expensive personal belongings. When their pool amounts only to PHP312,000, an anonymous donor sends them Php 688,000.00 to complete the amount. Gwen also objects to the ransom payments, as she could not fathom why the family would want to risk money for two househelps. While the ransom is being pooled, Polgas secretly goes to the wishing well in his master's garden and uses the cleverly disguised well to gain access to the Dog Cave, where he changes to his Dobermaxx persona. Using the Dog Cave's computer, he traces the location of the last transaction on Gwen's credit card. He pretends to be an erotic dancer in need of a job and penetrates the gay bar's inner circle. He soon sets his sights on Chipper and later kidnaps him for interrogation. He learns that the gang's safehouse was somewhere deep in Fort Santiago. As he tunnels through the old fort, Dobermaxx accidentally discovers the treasure Charles McDougal and his team had been looking for in the 1980s; Dobermaxx marks the spot with an electronic tracer. He soon locates the gang's safehouse and only chances upon Tangwel; Brosia and Glo are nowhere to be found. Dobermaxx hangs Tangwel from the ceiling and makes him talk; Tangwel says Demet left to collect the ransom money from Dagul. Dobermaxx leaves the safehouse to warn Dagul as the fort's concrete blocks signals from his satellite phone, but receives a call from Tiny telling him that the kidnappers were demanding another million. =Dobermaxx to the rescue= Dobermaxx notices that Tangwel was playing Bab's guitar and wearing Dagul's wristwatch, concluding that the kidnappers bought all the personal possessions the Sungcals had sold in their desperation to raise the ransom money. Dobermaxx takes Tangwel to the Sungcal residence and uses the Thunderdog's on-board computer to determine the location of \\"buy-and-sell\\" joints in the immediate vicinity, which he suspected was a front for a fencing operation run by the kidnappers. With the data in hand, Dobermaxx ejects from the speeding Thunderdog and deploys his delta-wing glider. He soon spots Dagul's car in one of the \\"buy-and-sell\\" joints. Detaching himself from the glider, Dobermaxx deploys Gary, his flea- bot, to act as a spotter. Gary enters the premises and sees several goons, including Chipper, in the living area; Demet, Brosia and Glo, together with two more kidnap victims, are in the basement. Dobermaxx transmits the hide- out's location to Dagul and attacks the place. Using his ballistic arnis, bolas and garapata gun, Dobermaxx takes down several of the goons before Demet and another cohort appears with Glo and Brosia as hostages. They force Dobermaxx to drop his weapon, before they open fire on him. At this point, Dagul and Bab arrives, disabling Demet and the second goon. Chipper, however, has the upper hand as he covers Dagul and Bab with a firearm. With perfect timing, Tomas and Noli arrives to subdue Chipper. Tangwel grabs Noli's revolver, but was in turn subdued by the policeman Gwen had summoned. The kidnappers then try to fool the cop into taking their side (with the \\"logic\\" that police officers were as equally guilty as criminals, as per the public's view of Filipino police officers), but the cop would have none of it in the end. Dobermaxx soon turns up with the cop's partner, whom he had convinced to return from the domestic airport with the ransom money. Dobermaxx's Amstac mesh vest (and his fat) had saved his life. Everyone waits for the anti-crime czar, \\"Kraymbuster\\" to make an appearance before the gang was booked, for the purpose of a media publicity stunt. It is later revealed that the anonymous donor was no other than Gwen. Epilogue At a party held some time after the incident, Gwen and Gloria reconcile with each other (Gwen, for not valuing her nanny enough to save her life, and Gloria, for messing with her ward's things without permission, which was the cause of the entire fiasco in the first place.). Gwen understands the Filipino family value that even maids are considered part of the household and that children always take care of their parents in their old age (\\"That's why you rarely see our parents in nursing homes\\", Tiny quips). When it is time for the two to leave and goodbyes are to be said, Gwen finally proclaims to be proud of her Filipino heritage to Tiny and unexpectedly gives Bab a goodbye kiss on the lips, which he enjoys. When Gloria appears to want a goodbye kiss from Bab, he gives her a chance since she's leaving anyway. However, Glo suddenly kicks him upwards, thus getting revenge. Meanwhile, Dobermaxx delivers 64,000 pieces of 900-troy ounce gold bullion as full payment for the Philippines foreign debt of US$29.189 billion (in 1992 figures) to Mother Teresa, who acts as his go-between, since he did not wish for his identity to be known. The gold haul was implied to be the Dobermaxx found in Fort Santiago. He also does the payment anonymously to effectively bypass government law of giving 10% of the find to the National Treasury and keep the treasure off the hands of corrupt officials (such as Senator Cabalfin, who unwittingly said that the bullion should go to his pocket before correcting himself). Shortly after, Mother Teresa arrives in the Philippines to start a fund for calamity victims using the staggering but still enormous amount from the gold. While Dagul and Polgas watch the news reports of these matters, despite the obviousness of the featured silhouette, Dagul asks Polgas his opinion on who the mystery benefactor was, to which the dog convincingly feigns indifference to such matters, effectively keeping his actions with the gold secret. Real-life references * Included in Bab, Joboy, and Polgas' repertoire during their serenade of Gwen are My Prayer by The Platters, Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton, Thriller by Michael Jackson and Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In by The 5th Dimension. \\"Thriller\\" kicks in when Glo shows up at the window. * Dagul's and Debbie's wristwatches are a TAG Heuer and a Baume et Mercier, respectively. * Charles McDougal was a former member of the United States Army Special Forces who did extensive excavation in Fort Santiago and on Corregidor in the 1980s, looking for the Yamashita treasure.SEARCH FOR YAMASHITA TREASURE CONTINUES, www.newsflash.com, Aug 13, 2005 *Pol Medina, Jr. used this story arc to launch a contest wherein the participants were required to answer a question on an observation made regarding the 52nd strip of the series; the contestants mailed their answers to the author.

The administration can be given by injection: intravenously, intramuscularly, intrathecally, subcutaneously, or by inhalation. The article on routes of administration provides more information, as the preceding list of ROAs is not exhaustive. Placement The placement of the bolus dose depends on the systemic levels of the contents desired throughout the body. An intramuscular injection of vaccines allows for a slow release of the antigen to stimulate the body's immune system and to allow time for developing antibodies. Subcutaneous injections are used by heroin addicts (called 'skin popping', referring to the bump formed by the bolus of heroin), to sustain a slow release that staves off withdrawal symptoms without producing euphoria. A bolus delivered directly to the veins through an intravenous drip allows a much faster delivery which quickly raises the concentration of the substance in the blood to an effective level. This is typically done at the beginning of a treatment or after a removal of medicine from blood (e.g. through dialysis). Diabetes Diabetics and health care professionals use bolus to refer to a dosage of fast-acting insulin with a meal (as opposed to basal rate, which is a dose of slow-acting insulin or the continuous pumping of a small quantity of fast-acting insulin to cover the glucose output of the liver). Veterinary medicine In veterinary medicine a bolus is a large time-release tablet that stays in the rumen of cattle, goats, and sheep. It can also refer to a dose of liquid injected subcutaneously with a hypodermic needle, such as saline solution administered either to counteract dehydration or especially to mitigate kidney failure, a common ailment in domestic cats. Before it is fully absorbed, which can take several minutes or longer, the liquid remains in the form of a bolus, a ball or lump under the animal's skin. Radiation therapy In radiation therapy, bolus is a waxy tissue equivalent material placed on the skin surface to homogenize or modulate the range of the dose from external beams of radiation.

In traditional underwriting, an APS is one of the most frequently ordered additional sources of medical background information. The APS is one of the more expensive underwriting requirements, as well as the most time consuming. It is usually completed only when a doctor has free time, as their primary focus is caring for patients. The underwriting cycle time is often severely hampered by the APS as it could take weeks or even months to obtain. Once obtained, it can be laborious to review and summarize as APS reports can be large documents containing an in-depth medical history information which may or may not be relevant. Overview In structured underwriting the data capture process with the proposed insured is asked very detailed questions to attempt to reduce the number of attending physician's statements necessary. However, many medical conditions require supporting evidence from the physician. This is where an APS Summary can assist the underwriter in evaluating the proposed insured's medical risk(s). The APS summaries however, are only as good as the underwriter's experience which varies widely from person to person. Additionally, APS summaries when processed without a ‚Äútemplate structure‚Äù guiding the information gathered from the APS often yield inconsistent or miss critical underwriting information. Either inconsistent or missing underwriting information will compromise the risk analysis process. By leveraging a seasoned underwriter's knowledge and experiences, scripts can be built that ensure the appropriate medical information is captured and recorded from the APS document. This is done by creating scripts that prompt the person summarizing the APS to enter all pertinent specific medical condition uncovered.

He is best known for his series of fictionalized biographies of Italian leaders in art and science, and for a volume of work that immortalizes traditions, values and ways of life of Tuscany and Florence. Ugolini left an early career as a lawyer to write, and his literary works, many of which are inducted as scholastic required reading in Italian schools, earned a worldwide reputation and several prestigious literary awards. He was also a painter, an expert ornithologist and gastronome. Biography Luigi Ugolini descended from a noble family of Tuscany whose recorded lineage dates back to 1585 in Arezzo, Italy. Ugolini was born in Florence, where his Siena-born father and his grandfather both had medical practices. Ugolini was a nobleman who was known to prefer the company of poor farmers in the regions of Maremma, whom he described as truer gentlemen than many of those so-called gentlemen in the city. Accounts depict Ugolini as playful as he was honestly outspoken. He married Lina Vaselli, and the couple had seven children, four sons and three daughters. Ugolini attended the Military Academy of Modena and graduated from the University of Pisa with a degree in Law, mainly to honor his father's wishes. After 10 years of practicing law, he made a dramatic move to devote his life to his calling of letters. He was introduced by Giovanni Papini in Nuova Antologia the leading Italian literary magazine (New Anthology). Ugolini's novels document and give voice to the nearly invisible Tuscan way of life, now absorbed into near nonexistence by a modernized and globalized Italy. For example, in his story of the fearless Domenico Tirbuzi, a Florentine Robin Hood of the poor masses, Ugolini preserves the dialogue, Tuscan dialect, and archaic words particular to the Maremma vernacular. Ugolini's The Story of My Land immortalizes bread making, cooking and many details of classic country life in a now changing Tuscany. Ugolini was godfather to his granddaughter, the novelist/poet Vanna Bonta. He named her Vanna after the female character in Dante Alighieri's \\"La Vita Nuova.\\" Lydia Ugolini, Ugolini's eldest daughter and a popular children's writer, returned to the Ugolini home after becoming widowed in 1964. She was appointed by Ugolini as executrix of his literary and personal estate in 1972, and later named to that position by Ugolini's last will and testament. She worked with her father and cared for him until his death in 1980. In his will, Ugolini left half of his estate to Lydia Ugolini, the maximum allowable to a testator by Italian law, and the remainder was divided among his other living children and descendants. Ugolini and his wife were married over sixty years at the time of her death in 1975. He died at home in Florence. His body is interred in the Porte Sante (Holy Doors) cemetery at the Basilica di San Miniato al Monte, Florence. On his death bed, Ugolini told his daughter Lydia that he had always been true to his wife, her mother, and was still in love with her. He added that she was the only woman he had loved and that he would marry her again. His last murmured words were, \\"Una pagina bianca\\" (literally \\"a white page\\" but meaning \\"a blank page\\" or \\"a new page\\"). Literary career Ugolini wrote fiction and novelized historical biographies for adults and young readers, many of which are required reading in Italian schools. In all, he published over 120 works, including technical manuals, radio dramas, scholastic texts, handbooks, cookbooks, and scientific essays. In 1916, Luigi Ugolini published Ex Corde, a collection of poems with themes about Nature, eternal war, and humanity. He was living as a second lieutenant after his graduation from the Military Academy of Modena and embarked in a law career for ten years, but this volume first publicly revealed Ugolini a poet. The book of the then-unknown author earned high praise in La Nazione reviews by noted writers of that epoch that included Grazia Deledda and Giovanni Marradi.Luigi Ugolini ‚Äì Scritti dal passato Ugolini was featured in many publications. He also contributed as a journalist to leading Italian newspapers, among them La Nazione and Messaggero. Following the review of an early work, New York Times Book Review (June 3, 1934) stated: \\"an extremely interesting biography of the one notorious brigand of the Maremma, Tiburzi, from the pen of Luigi Ugolini, painter and hunter, whose Il nido di Falasco (1932) first attracted attention to his possibilities as a man of letters. Ugolini will bear watching.\\" Book Reviews New York Times After World War II, Ugolini concentrated on literary work for youths, creating the famous series of \\"Novelized Biographies\\" for the Paravia, Societ√† Editrice Internazionale (SEI), and Minerva Italica publishing houses. Ugolini's passion for the land, adventure, and human sensibilities continues to spark the imaginations of youth.

On December 11, 1993, the Commune of Florence affixed a commemorative marble plaque to the Ugolini home in Florence, declaring the house a national monument. The epigraph on the plaque was unveiled during a government dedication ceremony in which some officials wore Renaissance-period clothing styles.

In a preface About Luigi Ugolini (1965), his publisher, Paravia, added the comment: ‚ÄúHis work adheres to its spirit and its inspiration, to the ancient region that always gave, by particular grace, the most iconic figures of art and science. Because his work has, of the Maremma region, the ancient mysterious spell, like the luminous Florentine hills and the deep silences of Volterra.‚Äù Political activity Known as a poet whose writings were a flame to conscience and ethical thinking, Ugolini is remembered as a brave spirit who considered indifference among the most reprehensible of sins. On the April 27, 1940, Ugolini was arrested by the Fascist police for his essays against the regime. When Benito Mussolini's political movement began to establish alliances with Germany, Ugolini protested and predicted the misfortune of entering World War II in alliance with Adolf Hitler. He was tried and condemned by the Special Court to two years of confinement as a political prisoner. Legends of Ugolini are still told in smaller towns of the Tuscan countryside. He is said to have packed his seven children into a car after a dishonest business manager lost their country villa, and to have lit a cigarette with a piece of money to show disdain for greed. Another legend tells of his arrest by the Fascist police. According to this legend, his daughter Maria Luisa went to the garden to announce to her father they had visitors, two men who claimed to be from Cinecitt√†. When Ugolini asked his daughter for her impression of them, she gave him the hand signal for \\"so-so.\\" Ugolini quietly instructed her to hide his typewriter. The two men in fact were Fascist police in disguise, and they arrested him. After interrogation and threats against his family, Ugolini admitted being the anonymous author of the anti-Fascist essays. Ugolini asked for copies of the essays in question, a pen, and a cigarette, and then he signed his name to each essay. He was spared execution because Mussolini admired his novel La Zolla and saw that the public opinion of Ugolini was too favorable.

Club career Ring was born in Glasgow and is best known for his time with Clyde, during which he won the Scottish Cup in 1954‚Äì55 and also in 1957‚Äì58. Ring scored the winning goal in the 1955 Scottish Cup Final replay versus Celtic. Clyde also won Scottish Division Two Championships in 1951‚Äì52 and 1956‚Äì57. He scored scored 178 goals in 384 appearances (national competitions only) for Clyde. Ring was transferred to Everton in January 1960 for ¬£12,000. He made a significant contribution for the Toffees in the 1960‚Äì61 season; many headlines were written concerning him, such as 'Blues could just Ring for service'. Ring departed Goodison Park after a broken leg injury in November 1961 and then signed for Barnsley. He returned to Scotland in 1963 to sign for Aberdeen for a short spell before ending his career with further brief spells at Fraserburgh in the Scottish Highland Football League and then Stevenage Town in the English Southern Football League. International career Ring was capped a dozen times for Scotland whilst playing for the Bully Wee and scored two goals, with one versus the famous Hungary team with Ferenc Pusk√°s during the 1954‚Äì55 season. The other was scored versus England at Wembley in 1957. Ring scored in the first minute, although England went on to win 2‚Äì1. Five of Ring's dozen caps were earned whilst the Bully Wee were playing in Division Two.Scotland Caps Below Top Level of Scottish football ScottishLeague.Net. Retrieved 19-03-2014. Ring also represented the Scottish League XI. His goal against England was as a Division Two (second tier) player. He was the last player to achieve this feat until Lawrence Shankland against San Marino in 2019. In popular culture Ring's name is now a running gag on BBC Radio Scotland's Off the Ball radio programme, as his surname has multiple connotations. This ensures that he makes it into the show's 'team of the week' almost every Saturday.

It publishes plays, represents authors, and sells scripts from their Los Angeles, UK, and online bookstores. The firm has offices in New York City; London; and Hollywood, California. An office in Toronto, Canada, closed in 2007. The company's London subsidiary, Samuel French Ltd., publishes stage plays for the UK market, mostly acting editions, serves as licensing agent for performance rights, and runs a theatrical bookshop on its premises at Fitzrovia in central London, England. In December 2018, Concord Music acquired Samuel French to form Concord Theatricals. History Samuel French, Inc. library edition of His Majesty, Bunker Bean Samuel French was born in Massachusetts shortly after the turn of the 19th century and began publishing French‚Äôs American Drama in the mid 1800s in New York. It soon became the most widely distributed catalogue of dramatic prose in the US. French soon acquired a London dramatic publishing company founded by Thomas Hailes Lacey, and continued to expand his business on both sides of the Atlantic - Samuel French managing the London business while his son, Thomas Henry, took control of the New York operations. In the late 1800s, Samuel French began publishing contemporary American dramas, and helped the amateur theatre movement by making more plays available to Little Theatres ‚Äì a rewarding concept that had never before been done in the industry. By the turn of the century, amateur interest in acting had increased enormously. As the quality and quantity of available plays improved, so the number of amateur groups increased. The seeds of the Little Theatre movement were sown. By the time of the World War I, such groups along with the High School societies were the firm‚Äôs best customers. Although father and son had long since died, the New York and London entities continued under the capable hands of their managing partners. From the mid 1940s to the early 1990s, the company witnessed significant growth in its catalogue and business. During this time, Stock companies, including the League of Resident Theatres were flourishing; so too were the Little Theatres, and the development of the Dinner theater, which was proving increasingly popular. Since the mid-1990s, the Samuel French catalogue has grown substantially with a focus on emerging playwrights carefully balanced by additional acquisitions of the most prominent American and British playwrights such as Neil Simon, Tom Stoppard, Edward Albee, August Wilson and David Mamet. Breaking Character Samuel French publishes an online magazine entitled Breaking Character. On the site, staff members and guest authors contribute to writing various articles related to the world of theatre. Topics include new publications, title spotlights, musical moments, staff picks, and playwright profiles. The magazine allows for interaction with the public. Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival Samuel French‚Äôs annual Off-Off-Broadway Short Play Festival (commonly referred to as OOB) takes place every summer in New York City. Thousands of playwrights from around the world submit their short plays for consideration, and 30 are chosen to participate. The festival takes place over a week, with 4‚Äì8 plays being presented per night. Finalists are narrowed down and eventually six are chosen as the winners. Winners are presented with publication and licensing rights and have their show published in a collection of winners from that year. The festival has resulted in the publishing of nearly 200 plays since its inception in 1975 and has launched the careers of many playwrights including Sheila Callaghan, Theresa Rebeck, and Saviana Stanescu. As of 2019 the festival is in its 44th year. Samuel French Limited French's Theatre Bookshop Samuel French Ltd is the UK sister company of Samuel French Inc. The company publishes stage plays for the UK market, mostly acting editions, serves as licensing agent for performance rights. The theatrical bookshop at Fitzroy Street, London, England, closed in 2017, however it was announced that they would be opening a bookshop inside the Royal Court Theatre in March 2018.

Its name is derived from those of the two sites included in the district: one that lies along Clough Creek (a tributary of the Little Miami RiverDeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 75. .), and one that occupies part of the Sand Ridge near the creek.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. Sites =Clough Creek= The Clough Creek Site occupies an area of approximately ; although no archaeological excavation has been conducted there, it is believed to have been the site of a large prehistoric village. =Sand Ridge= The Sand Ridge Site lies about away from the Clough Creek Site. Located along a prominent ridgeline to the west of the old Union Bridge along the road between Cincinnati and Batavia, it has long been known as a significant archaeological site. As early as the 1880s, many individuals frequently visited the ridge to collect artifacts from the surface, such as bones, pottery, and pieces of flint. The residents appear to have inhabited the site only seasonally, with autumn and winter being the most likely times of occupation. They appear to have been heavily dependent on fish for their food, as many fish bones have been discovered at Sand Ridge; among the most common types of fish were suckers, channel catfish, and freshwater drums.Emerson, Thomas E., et al. Late Woodland Societies: Tradition and Transformation across the Midcontinent. Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 2000, 84. Excavation and conclusions On behalf of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, archaeologists investigated a midden at Sand Ridge in 1884. They were able to add a wide range of artifacts to the museum's collection, including a wide range of stone tools, bird and deer bones, and projectile points. In more recent years, Clough Creek has also attracted attention for the artifacts visible on its surface, including scrapers, blanks, and projectile points. According to archaeological estimates, some artifacts at the site may be buried as much as below the surface. Despite the distance between the two sites, they are believed to be closely related. Artifacts found at Sand Ridge indicate that they are part of the Madisonville Focus of the Fort Ancient culture.Brady-Rawlins, Kathleen. The O.C. Voss Site: Reassessing What We Know about the Fort Ancient Occupation of the Central Scioto Drainage and Its Tributaries. Diss. Ohio State University, 2007. Accessed 2010-06-17. This identification is based primarily on the pottery recovered, which resembles that of the Madisonville and State Line Sites. A distinctive feature of Sand Ridge is the presence of artifacts from two chronologically different cultures: the Fort Ancient village was apparently built on the site of an earlier Late Woodland occupation. Recognition In 1974, the Clough Creek and Sand Ridge Archaeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its information-yielding potential. In the community of Newtown to the east are several villages that have received a similar status: the Perin, Turpin, and Hahn Field Sites. Like Clough Creek and Sand Ridge, Turpin and Hahn Field were once Fort Ancient villages that were founded atop former Woodland period villages, while Perin Village and the related Odd Fellows' Cemetery Mound are exclusively Woodland sites.

Although the facade is two stories tall, the main manufacturing section is just one story; a basement underlies much of the building. Some of the architecture, including the little-changed lobby, employs Art Deco details. In conjunction with the general Streamline Moderne appearance, the Art Deco features emphasize a sense of modernism with few parallels in the Cincinnati area, especially because the style's application to an industrial facility was unusual. The company promoted its use of highly mechanized production equipment at this facility; its ability to produce 500 bottles each minute was highly touted. Post-bottling Coca-Cola no longer employs the building for beverage production. It was later converted for the use of F&W; Publications, and then Xavier University acquired the property in early 2002. Renovations quickly began, with extra space used for offices and rented to Cincinnati Country Day School after one of its buildings collapsed. In June 2004, the university announced that a gift from wealthy alumni would be used to convert the building into an alumni center with space for conferences, banquets, and other types of meetings.Plans Move Forward for Alumni Center Renovation , Xavier University, 2004-06-25.

Richard was born in Princeville, Quebec to Louis- Eus√®be Richard and Hermine Prince. After receiving his law degree in 1867, taking courses at both Universit√© Laval and McGill College, Richard began to practice in Arthabaskaville with Wilfrid Laurier.Roberts, Charles G. D. and Arthuer L. Tunnell, eds. A Standard Dictionary of Canadian Biography: The Canadian Who Was Who, Volume I. Toronto: Trans-Canada Press, 1934, pg. 428. He practiced for several years before being elected to the House of Commons from M√©gantic in 1872 and was re-elected in 1874. His health forced him to not seek reelection in the 1878 Canadian Parliamentary elections. Politically, Richard was a liberal protectionist.Roberts and Tunnell, pg. 823 Richard became the sheriff of the Northwest Territories soon after leaving the House of Commons, and remained in that position until January 1883. After resigning from his post as sheriff, he sought election to the House of Commons again in 1883 in St. Boniface, but was defeated by Alphonse Alfred Cl√©ment Larivi√®re. Richard sought election once more, in 1889 in Provencher, but Larivi√©re again defeated him. In between his political posts, Richard was also a fairly successful businessman. Unfortunately, his political campaigns and frequent ill health prevented him from ever amassing substantial wealth. Richard was of Acadian heritage. Following his last failed campaign, Richard returned to Arthabaskaville and began to immerse himself in his heritage. He fervently promoted the Acadian cause, petitioning for an Acadian museum, working on his own research, and even starting a campaign for reparations. An 1893 article in Toronto by Pierce Stevens Hamilton and histories by Francis Parkman and Thomas Beamish Akins spurred Richard to begin his own published history.Roberts and Tunnell, pg. 429 His work, Acadia, Missing Links of a Lost Chapter in American History, was published in two volumes in 1895. His work was controversial, both for mixing English and French in text and, more significantly, lacking annotations and citations. His book was republished with annotations added by his cousin, Henri d'Arles, from 1916 to 1921. Despite this controversy, his work brought him accolades, including an election to the Royal Society of Canada and an honorary doctorate from Universit√© Laval. In 1897, Richard, who never married, was named the successor to Joseph Marmette as the official Canadian archivist in France. This was his last main work before his death in Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan in 1904.

The building has an irregular plan, due partly to multiple locations at which elements of brick project from the walls. Rather than being of a single style, the town hall is an eclectic structure, mixing elements of the Greek Revival and Renaissance Revival styles. For example, various parts of the roof are disparate: some are hipped, while others rise to gables. A brick frieze with corbelling is placed near the top of the walls, while the cornice itself is formed of crafted metal. Indoors, the building is divided into rooms for numerous functions. In addition to the meeting room for the village council, the building has space for a community room with stage and for apartments in which the village's jailer could live. In 1978, the College Hill Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in the area's history and because of its historically significant architecture.

Discovered in the middle of a gravel pit, the site is a leading example of the local manifestation of the Archaic period. The site lies atop a Miami River terrace outside the village of Cleves, occupying a soil location with a small layer of silty loam that covers a deep deposit of gravel. Contributing to the site's desirability for ancient occupation is a small stream, which inhabitants could have used as a source for water instead of climbing down to the riverside.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 590. The extensive deposit of gravel had prompted the Dravo Corporation to open a gravel pit before the site's discovery, and because of ongoing commercial operations, archaeologists conducted a salvage excavation and were unable to examine the large majority of the site. Their hurried excavation revealed groups of features, typically comprising cooking and trash pits, prompting the excavation team to suggest that each group of features had been used by a separate family. Observing that the trash pits had consistently been covered by soil after being dug, the excavators posited that the inhabitants had exhibited a sense of sanitation, burying garbage in pits rather than piling it on the ground, although evidence from later sites demonstrates that growing populations forced later generations to abandon the creation of trash pits in favor of building large middens on the ground.Otto, Martha P., and Brian G. Redmond. Transitions: Archaic and Early Woodland Research in the Ohio Country. Athens: Ohio UP, 2008. Aside from these cuts and fills, findings at the site included burials and tools. Ten human bodies, ranging in age from a girl no older than seven to a woman in her late thirties, were found in various positions, and two canine burials distinguished Dravo from similar sites in the region. Some of the bodies had been buried with scrapers and other stone tools, while other bodies were placed with animal bones and teeth. Elsewhere at the site, many more stone tools were discovered, including implements such as axes, atlatl components, pestles, and celts. Measuring approximately in area, the site's dating is dependent on the technological level of the inhabitants, as radiocarbon dating yielded results centering on the fifth century BC, radically later than those of similar sites in the region; typical of such sites, the dating for the Bullskin Creek Site is slightly more than two thousand years earlier than the results obtained at Dravo. The inhabitants' technology prompted their classification as a people of the middle of the Late Archaic Period. In 1978, the Dravo site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its archaeological significance.

Constructed in the late nineteenth century as a significant part of the city water supply system, it was used for its original purpose for only a few decades.

The station formed part of the city's water supply network, raising water from the nearby Ohio River and moving it into the Eden Park Standpipe, which was finished in the same year as the pumping station. When built, the station was able to move of water with Snyder and Holly pumps, but only for a few years did the network operate as designed. A new station in the East End opened in 1907 to replace the stations in Eden Park and on Front Street downtown; contamination in the nearby Deer Creek, which by this time had been converted into a sewer,Greve, Charles Theodore.

After years of little use, the station was restored to usefulness in 1939, as its tower was converted into a radio station for police purposes. Architecture City officials employed Samuel Hannaford as the architect for the Eden Park Station. By 1889, Hannaford was the city's premier architect: he had designed the grand Music Hall near downtown in the 1870s,Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. he was favored as a residential architect by the metropolitan area's elites, and he had produced structures far from the Cincinnati metropolitan area, including the tall Vigo County Courthouse in Terre Haute, Indiana and the smaller Perry County Jail in faraway Pinckneyville, Illinois. Many of his functional buildings still standing in Cincinnati are eclectic in style; instead of insisting on a specific style or styles, Hannaford freely designed in many different styles popular in the late nineteenth century. The Eden Park Station is typical of these, exhibiting features of the Neoclassical, the Queen Anne, and the Romanesque Revival styles. Although the walls of the building and its associated chimney are brick, the building rests on a stone foundation, and the roof is tiled., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-04-08.

William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be one of the most-screened plays of all time. The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production Romeo and Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films. Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences.Orgel, Stephen \\"Shakespeare Illustrated\\" in Shaughnessy, Robert (ed.) \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare and Popular Culture\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2007, ) p.91 Several reworkings of the story have also been filmed, most notably West Side Story, Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet and Romanoff and Juliet. Several theatrical films, such as Shakespeare in Love and Romeo Must Die, consciously use elements of Shakespeare's plot. Significant feature releases =George Cukor (1936)= Norma Shearer as Juliet in the balcony scene of George Cukor's 1936 Romeo and Juliet. Producer Irving Thalberg pushed MGM for five years to make a Romeo and Juliet, in the face of the studio's opposition: which stemmed from Louis B. Mayer's belief that the masses considered the Bard over their heads, and from the austerity forced on the studios by the depression. It was only when Jack L. Warner announced his intention to film Max Reinhardt's A Midsummer Night's Dream that Mayer, not to be outdone, gave Thalberg the go-ahead.Brode, Douglas \\"Shakespeare in the Movies: From the Silent Era to Today\\" (2001, Berkeley Boulevard, New York, ) p.43 Thalberg's stated intention was \\"to make the production what Shakespeare would have wanted had he possessed the facilities of cinema.\\"Thalberg, Irving - quoted by Brode, p.44 He went to great lengths to establish authenticity and the film's intellectual credentials: researchers were sent to Verona to take photographs for the designers; the paintings of Botticelli, Bellini, Carpaccio and Gozzoli were studied to provide visual inspiration; and two academic advisers (John Tucker Murray of Harvard and William Strunk, Jr. of Cornell) were flown to the set, with instructions to criticise the production freely.Brode, p.44 The film includes two songs drawn from other plays by Shakespeare: \\"Come Away Death\\" from Twelfth Night and \\"Honour, Riches, Marriage, Blessing\\" from The Tempest.Tatspaugh, Patricia \\"The Tragedy of Love on Film\\" in Jackson, Russell \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2000, ) p.137 Thalberg had only one choice for director: George Cukor, who was known as \\"the women's director\\". Thalberg's vision was that the performance of Norma Shearer, his wife, would dominate the picture. Leslie Howard as Romeo and Norma Shearer as Juliet, in the 1936 MGM film directed by George Cukor. Scholar Stephen Orgel describes Cukor's film as \\"largely miscast ... with a preposterously mature pair of lovers in Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer, and an elderly John Barrymore as a stagey Mercutio decades out of date.\\"Orgel, p.91 Barrymore was in his late fifties, and played Mercutio as a flirtatious tease.Tatspaugh, p.138 Romeo wears gloves in the balcony scene, and Juliet has a pet fawn.Tatspaugh, p.136 Tybalt is usually portrayed as a hot-headed troublemaker, but Basil Rathbone played him as stuffy and pompous.Brode, p.47 Thalberg cast screen actors, rather than stage actors, but shipped-in East Coast drama coaches (such as the acclaimed Frances Robinson Duff to coach Norma Shearer - who had never acted on stage) with the unfortunate consequence that actors previously adored for their naturalism gave what are now considered stilted performances. The shoot extended to six months, and the budget reached $2 million, making it MGM's most expensive film since the 1925 silent Ben-Hur.Brode, p.45 Like most Shakespearean filmmakers, Cukor and his screenwriter Talbot Jennings cut much of the original script: playing around 45% of it.Tatspaugh, p.137 Many of these cuts are common ones in the theatre, such as the second appearance of the chorusRomeo and Juliet II.0.1-14 and the comic scene of Peter with the musicians.Romeo and Juliet IV.v.96-141 Others are filmic: designed to replace words with action, or rearranging scenes in order to introduce groups of characters in longer narrative sequences. However, Jennings retains more of Shakespeare's poetry for the young lovers than any of his big-screen successors. Several scenes are interpolated, including three sequences featuring Friar John in Mantua. In contrast, the role of Friar Laurence (an important character in the play) is much reduced.Brode, p.46 A number of scenes are expanded as opportunities for visual spectacle, including the opening brawl (set against the backdrop of a religious procession), the wedding and Juliet's funeral. The party scene,Romeo and Juliet I.v choreographed by Agnes de Mille, includes Rosaline (an unseen character in Shakespeare's script) who rebuffs Romeo. The role of Peter is enlarged, and played by Andy Devine as a faint-hearted bully. He speaks lines which Shakespeare gave to other Capulet servants, making him the instigator of the opening brawl.Romeo and Juliet I.i Clusters of images are used to define the central characters: Romeo is first sighted leaning against a ruined building in an arcadian scene, complete with a pipe-playing shepherd and his sheepdog; the livelier Juliet is associated with Capulet's formal garden, with its decorative fish pond. Neither critics nor the public responded enthusiastically, although Robert Osborne has stated that the film was a success when he hosted a telecast of it on Turner Classic Movies. Graham Greene wrote that he was \\"less than ever convinced that there is an aesthetic justification for filming Shakespeare at all... the effect of even the best scenes is to distract.\\"Greene, Graham reviewing George Cukor's 1936 Romeo and Juliet in The Spectator. Extracted from Greene, Graham and Taylor, John Russell (ed.) \\"The Pleasure Dome. Collected Film Criticism 1935-40\\" (Oxford, 1980) cited by Jackson, Russell \\"From Play-Script to Screenplay\\" in Jackson, Russell (ed.) \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film (15-34) at p.21 Cinemagoers considered the film too \\"arty\\", staying away as they had from Warner's A Midsummer Night Dream a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade.Brode, p.48 The film nevertheless received four Oscar nominations. Subsequent film versions would make use of less experienced, but more photogenic, actors in the central roles. Cukor, interviewed in 1970, said of his film: \\"It's one picture that if I had to do over again, I'd know how. I'd get the garlic and the Mediterranean into it.\\" Tatspaugh, p.136, citing George Cukor. A fuller version of the quotation, used here, appears in Rosenthal, Daniel \\"BFI Screen Guides: 100 Shakespeare Films\\" (British Film Institute, London, 2007, ) p.209 (Note that these sources conflict on the date of this interview: Rosenthal says 1971.) =Franco Zeffirelli (1968)= Olivia Hussey as Juliet in the balcony scene of Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet. Stephen Orgel describes Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 Romeo and Juliet as being \\"full of beautiful young people, and the camera, and the lush technicolour, make the most of their sexual energy and good looks.\\" Sarah Munson Deats ‚Äì referring to recent opposition to the Vietnam War ‚Äì says that the film was \\"particularly intended to attract the counter-culture youth, a generation of young people, like Romeo and Juliet, estranged from their parents, torn by the conflict between their youthful cult of passion and the military tradition of their elders.\\", cited by Tatspaugh, p. 140 Filming at the time of the \\"British Invasion\\", Zeffirelli was able to use an English cast to appeal to American audiences.Brode, p. 51 Zeffirelli said of his film: In truth, Zeffirelli's young leads were already experienced actors: Leonard Whiting (then seventeen) had been the youngest member of the National Theatre, and had played The Artful Dodger in Oliver! on stage. Olivia Hussey (aged fifteen) had studied for four years at the Italia Conti Drama School, and had starred opposite Vanessa Redgrave in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in the West End.Brode, pp. 51‚Äì2; Rosenthal, p. 218. Zeffirelli filmed his Romeo and Juliet shortly after completing work on his 1967 film The Taming of the Shrew, and had learned from his experience on that project that it was better not to include speeches made redundant by his vivid images.Brode, p. 52 He played around 35% of Shakespeare's script, enhancing the focus on the two central characters and making them more sympathetic, while simplifying their roles to make them less tricky for his young leads to play.Tatspaugh, p. 141 He tellingly juxtaposes the betrothal of Juliet and Paris with the Capulets' crumbling marriage. Yet the film is often noted for its zest for life and for love: the former epitomised by John McEnery's Mercutio, the latter by Leonard Whiting's Romeo. In contrast to Renato Castellani's 1954 version, Zeffirelli highlighted Romeo's positive relationships with the Friar, Balthazar and Mercutio. The way in which Mercutio physically collapses onto Romeo after the Queen Mab speech, and again when mortally wounded, has been credited with introducing homosexual overtones into the public perception of their relationship. Zefirelli's handling of the duel scene has been particularly praised,For example, by Anthony West of Vogue and Mollie Panter-Downes of The New Yorker, cited by Brode, pp. 52‚Äì53 and his device later adopted by Baz Luhrmann. Taking his cue from Benvolio's speech ending \\"For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring\\"Romeo and Juliet III.i.1‚Äì4. Zefirelli depicts the dry, oppressive heat of the little town where (in Anthony West's words) \\"men seek to kill each other to relieve their exasperation at having nothing better to do\\".Anthony West in Vogue, cited by Brode, p.53 The duel is presented as bravado getting out-of-control: the youths baiting one another, half- teasingly. Critic Robert Hatch described Tybalt and Mercutio as like \\"a couple of neighborhood warlords, vaunting their courage with grandstand high jinks, trying for a victory by humiliation, and giving no strong impression of a taste to kill.\\"Robert Hatch in The Nation, cited by Brode, p.53 The scene increases sympathy for Michael York's Tybalt (often played as a bloodthirsty bully on the stage) by making him shocked and guilty at the lethal wound he has inflicted.Brode, p.53 Like most screen directors of the play, Zeffirelli cut the duel with Paris,Romeo and Juliet V.iii.49-73 which helps to keep Romeo sympathetic to the audience.Brode, pp.54‚Äì55 A particular difficulty for any screenwriter arises towards the end of the fourth act, where Shakespeare's play requires considerable compression to be effective on the big screen, without giving the impression of \\"cutting to the chase\\".Jackson, Russell \\"From play-script to screenplay\\" in Jackson, Russell \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2000, ) p.30 In Zeffirelli's version, Juliet's return home from the Friar's cell, her submission to her father and the preparation for the wedding are drastically abbreviated, and the tomb scene is also cut short: Paris does not appear at all, and Benvolio (in the Balthazar role) is sent away but is not threatened.Jackson, p.30 The film courted controversy by including a nude wedding-night sceneRomeo and Juliet III.v while Olivia Hussey was only fifteen.Rosenthal, p.220 Nino Rota's Love Theme from the film, with the original lyrics (which had been drawn from several Shakespeare plays) replaced to become the song \\"A Time For Us\\", became a modest international chart hit.Buhler, Stephen M. \\"Musical Shakespeares\\" in Shaughnessy, Robert (ed.) \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare and Popular Culture\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2007, ) p.156-7 =Baz Luhrmann (1996)= Australian director Baz Luhrmann's 1996 Romeo + Juliet and its accompanying soundtrack successfully targeted the \\"MTV Generation\\": a young audience of similar age to the story's characters.Tatspaugh, p.140 Far darker than Zeffirelli's version, the film is set in the \\"crass, violent and superficial society\\" of Verona Beach and Sycamore Grove.Tatspaugh, p.142 The visual conventions of the film were (in Stephen Orgel's words) \\"largely those of porn films\\". Luhrmann studied Zeffirelli's heavily cut script, and retained Shakespeare's language; however, he brought the setting up to date, making the Montagues and Capulets mobsters in a modern Miami-like city (although actually filmed in Mexico City and Veracruz).Brode, pp.55‚Äì6 Luhrmann said of his film: Luhrmann was impressed with the verse-speaking of his Romeo, Leonardo DiCaprio, saying \\"the words just came out of his mouth as if it was the most natural language possible\\".Luhrmann Others were less kind: Daniel Rosenthal comments that \\"DiCaprio's throwaway, sometimes inaudible delivery is, for those not inclined to swoon uncritically at his beauty, the movie's weakest link.\\" Rosenthal, p.224 Juliet, the sixteen-year-old Claire Danes, was praised for portraying a poise and wisdom beyond her years, and as the first screen Juliet whose speech sounded spontaneous.Luhrmann; Rosenthal, p.224 Miriam Margolyes played the nurse for laughs as a plump Hispanic, forever crying \\"Hooliet! Hooliet!\\" Pete Postlethwaite, with his Celtic Cross tattoo, captures the \\"charming ambiguity\\" of the Friar.Rosenthal, p.224; Brode, p.57 Paul Sorvino and Diane Venora play the Capulets as a boozy gangland patriarch and a miserable southern belle, unhappily married and frequently abusive to each other.Brode, p.57 A framing device portrays the events of the play as newscasts and newspaper headlines.Tatspaugh, p.143 The film's action sequences were reminiscent of the films of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo, and its characters wear designer clothes and (in Douglas Brode's words) \\"a lingerie collection worthy of Madonna\\".Brode, p.56 As Peter Travers commented in Rolling Stone, the intention was to \\"make Romeo and Juliet accessible to the elusive Gen-X audience without leaving the play bowdlerised and broken\\".Peter Travers' review in Rolling Stone, cited by Brode, p.56 Some aspects of the modernisation have been praised as effective (a newscaster speaking the prologue, for example, or the replacement of Friar John with a courier message which gets misdelivered); others have been criticised as ridiculous: including a police chief banishing Romeo for a street killing rather than ordering his arrest.Brode, pp.56‚Äì7 Luhrmann highlighted the religious aspects of the play, surrounding his two central characters with religious icons, and staging his finale in a cathedral. That final scene was regarded by some critics as Luhrmann's masterstroke: adapting a device first used in restoration adaptations of the play,Specifically, this derives from Thomas Otway's adaptation set in ancient Rome: The History and Fall of Caius Marius Juliet begins to wake before Romeo takes the poison, but he does not notice her movements until he has done so, then he dies aware that she has survived. The scene uses cuts and extreme close-ups to generate a tension impossible to achieve in the theatre.Brode, pp.57‚Äì8 The mood is undermined a moment later as Juliet blows her brains out with a pistol.Brode, p.58 The role of the watch is cut completely, permitting Friar Laurence to be with Juliet and to be taken by surprise by her sudden suicide.Jackson, p.31 The film's prominent use of tracks from popular bands including Radiohead and The Cardigans (and especially prominently Mercutio's wild transvestite dancing to the disco anthem Young Hearts Run Free) led to two hit soundtrack albums. Mixed reviews greeted the endeavor, including Luhrmann's decision to delete the reconciliation of the feuding families, thus undermining the play's original ending and its lesson concerning the price of peace.Dowling, Crystal Misshapen chaos of well-seeming form: Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet accessed 23 March 2008 Todd McCarthy, in Variety, summed up: \\"as irritating and glib as some of it may be, there is indisputably a strong vision here that has been worked out in considerable detail.\\"McCarthy, Todd review in Variety, cited by Brode, p.58 As Zeffirelli's version had done before it, Baz Luhrmann's film broke the record for the highest-grossing Shakespeare film of all time, taking $144m worldwide.Rosenthal, p.225 Other performances Film scholar Douglas Brode claims that Romeo and Juliet is the most-filmed play of all time.Brode, p.42 In the silent era it was filmed by Georges M√©li√®s, which inspired a burlesque by Thomas Edison: both of which are now lost. Vitagraph produced a ten-minute version in 1908 which has survived, featuring Florence Lawrence. Gerolamo Lo Savio shot an ambitious version on location in Verona for Film d'Arte Italiana.Brode, pp.42‚Äì43 Edwin and Gertrude Thanhouser produced a spectacular version in the USA.Brode, p.43 In 1916, Metro and Fox produced versions of the play as star-vehicles, the former featuring Francis X. Bushman as Romeo, and the latter featuring Theda Bara (usually famous for \\"vamp\\" roles) as the innocent Juliet. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer as Juliet, who would later play the same role in George Cukor's feature version. Renato Castellani won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of Romeo and Juliet. His film contains interpolated scenes intended to establish the class system and Catholicism of Renaissance Verona, and the nature of the feud. Some of Castellani's changes have been criticised as ineffective: interpolated dialogue is often banal, and the Prince's appearances are reimagined as formal hearings: undermining the spontaneity of Benvolio's defence of Romeo's behaviour in the duel scene.Tatspaugh, p.139 The major supporting roles are vastly reduced, including that of the nurse; Mercutio becomes (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) \\"the tiniest of cameos\\" and Friar Laurence \\"an irritating ditherer\\",Rosenthal, pp.213‚Äì4 although Pauline Kael, who loved the film, called this Friar Laurence \\"a radiantly silly little man\\".http://www.geocities.ws/paulinekaelreviews/r4.html Castellani's most prominent changes related to Romeo's character, cutting back or removing scenes involving his parents, Benvolio and Mercutio in order to highlight Romeo's isolation, and inserting a parting scene in which Montague coldly pulls his banished son out of Lady Montague's farewell embrace. Another criticism made by film scholar Patricia Tatspaugh is that the realism of the settings, so carefully established throughout the film, \\"goes seriously off the rails when it come to the Capulets' vault\\". Castellani uses competing visual images in relation to the central characters: ominous grilles (and their shadows) contrasted with frequent optimistic shots of blue sky. A well- known stage Romeo, John Gielgud, played Castellani's chorus (and would reprise the role in the 1978 BBC Shakespeare version). Laurence Harvey, as Romeo, was already an experienced screen actor, who would shortly take over roles intended for the late James Dean in Walk on the Wild Side and Summer and Smoke.Brode, pp.48‚Äì9 By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub, and was cast for her \\"pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair\\".Brode, p.51, quoting Renato Castellani. She failed to rise to the demands of the role, and would marry shortly after the shoot, never returning to screen acting.Brode, p.51, Rosenthal, p.213 Other parts were played by inexperienced actors, also: Mercutio was played by an architect, Montague by a gondolier from Venice, and the Prince by a novelist.Rosenthal, p.214 Critics responded to the film as a piece of cinema (its visuals were especially admired in Italy, where it was filmed) but not as a performance of Shakespeare's play: Robert Hatch in The Nation said \\"We had come to see a play... perhaps we should not complain that we were shown a sumptuous travelogue\\", and Time's reviewer added that \\"Castellani's Romeo and Juliet is a fine film poem... Unfortunately it is not Shakespeare's poem!\\"Brode, pp.50‚Äì1 In 1992, Leon Garfield abridged the play to 25 minutes for the S4C/Soyuzmultfilm Shakespeare: The Animated Tales series. Such drastic abridgement inevitably led to emphasising plot over character, and the Romeo and Juliet episode has been described as \\"almost absurdly frenetic\\". This episode was directed by Efim Gamburg, using cel animation.Rosenthal, pp.280‚Äì281 The PBS series Wishbone aired its fourth episode \\"Rosie, Oh! Rosie, Oh!\\" in 1995 featuring the titular Jack Russell terrier as Romeo Montague in a television stage production of Romeo and Juliet. Adaptations The name of Romeo and Juliet has become synonymous with young love. Tony Howard concludes that \\"we inherit so many of our images of romance, generational discord and social hatred from the play that it is impossible to list all its cinematic reincarnations\\",. citing works as disparate as the Polish 1937 Romeo i Julieta, the Swiss 1941 ', the French 1949 Les amants de V√©rone and the Czech 1960 Romeo, Juliet a Tma.Howard, p. 297. As a result of this ubiquity, any film about young love and its challenges will court comparison with Romeo and Juliet, as Roseanna McCoy did in 1949, and two James Dean films ‚Äì East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause ‚Äì did in the 1950s.Brode, pp. 58‚Äì9 In 1960, Peter Ustinov's stage parody of Romeo and Juliet, Romanoff and Juliet was filmed ‚Äì dramatising true love interfering with the cold-war superpowers' attempts to control the fictional state of Concordia. In 1980 an episode of the anime Astro Boy was based on the Romeo and Juliet story. There were two rival car and robot companies, which racer Robio falls in love with Robiette of the rival company. At the end the two young lovers get smooshed together by both their fathers driving into each other, and after that they two rivals give up the fight, and Astro remarks that now Robio and Robiette will be together forever. The success of the 1957 stage musical West Side Story was instrumental in making Shakespeare a presence in modern popular and youth culture.Buhler, p. 154 The book was written by Arthur Laurents, with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and choreography by Jerome Robbins. Widely admired, and the winner of ten Oscars, the 1961 film of the show ‚Äì set among New York gangs ‚Äì does not aim for a realistic portrayal of New York gang culture: in the opening sequence the Jets and the Sharks trade dance-steps instead of blows.Rosenthal, pp. 216‚Äì7 The Jets are a gang of white youths, equivalent to Shakespeare's Montagues; the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican.Rosenthal, pp.215‚Äì6 Unlike Shakespeare who included relationships between his young lovers and the older generation (the parents, and parent-substitutes such as the Nurse and Friar Laurence) West Side Story keeps its focus firmly on the youth, with only peripheral roles for Doc, the soda-shop owner, and police officers Schrank and Krupke.Rosenthal, p. 216. Tony (played by Richard Beymer, singing dubbed by Jimmy Bryant) is the play's Romeo and Maria (Natalie Wood, dubbed by Marni Nixon) is its Juliet. Maria's fiery brother Bernardo (George Chakiris) combines the Lord Capulet and Tybalt roles. The film's ending has been praised for achieving the tragedy of Shakespeare's play without recourse to magic potions or fateful bad timing. In 1996, Troma Studios and director Lloyd Kaufman filmed Tromeo and Juliet, a transgressive \\"trash/punk\\" adaptation of the play, set in present-day Manhattan and featuring Lemmy (of Mot√∂rhead) as its chorus. Sporting the tagline \\"Body piercing. Kinky sex. Dismemberment. The things that made Shakespeare great.\\", Tromeo and Juliet premiered at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and won several awards at independent horror and fantasy film festivals.Young, Deborah.

In the 2005 anime Basilisk the story about two rival ninja clans fighting each other but one of their members love each other is similar to that of Romeo and Juliet. The 2007 anime Romeo x Juliet is a fantasy retelling of the famed play. In it, Juliet's family were rulers of a floating island nation called Neo Verona before being killed by the Montagues, forcing her to hide in a theater troupe owned by a fictional version of William Shakespeare. The play has also inspired two major Bollywood romantic dramas: Mansoor Khan's Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988) starring Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Ram-Leela (2013) starring Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone. Tanna (2015), the depiction of a Romeo and Juliet-like story based on an actual marriage dispute, is set on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu.https://theconversation.com/award-winning-film-tanna-sets-romeo-and- juliet-in-the-south-pacific-49874 The 2017 TV series Still Star-Crossed includes brief scenes based on the original play but focuses primarily on the families after the deaths of the two main characters. The Spanish TV series La que se avecina parodied a surrealist story of Romeo and Juliet in the episode eight of the season eight. Antonio Pagudo portrayed Romeo and Cristina Casta√±o portrayed Juilet. An upcoming anime television series based on the manga of the same name, titled Kishuku Gakk≈ç no Juliet (Boarding School Juliet), features the titular characters in a modern day, Japanese high school setting. Films featuring performances, or composition Another way in which film- makers and authors use Shakespearean texts is to feature characters who are actors performing those texts, within a wider non-Shakespearean story. Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are the two plays which have most often been used in this way.McKernan, Luke and Terris, Olwen (eds.) \\"Walking Shadows: Shakespeare in the National Film and Television Archive\\" (British Film Institute, 1994, ) list 45 instances of uses of Hamlet, not including films of the play itself, at pp.45‚Äì66. They list 39 such instances for Romeo and Juliet at pp.141‚Äì156. The next closest is Othello, with 23 instances, at pp.119‚Äì131. Usually, Shakespeare's story has some parallel or resonance with the main plot. Films featuring characters performing scenes from Romeo and Juliet include the 1912 and 1982 film versions of Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby, Cured Hams (1927), Drama De Luxe (1927), Broadway Fever (1928), Les amants de V√©rone (1949), Marjorie Morningstar (1958), Carry on Teacher (1959) Shakespeare Wallah (1965) and, significantly, Shakespeare in Love (1998).McKernan and Terris, pp.141‚Äì156 The 1941 film Playmates features bandleader Kay Kyser and Shakespearean actor John Barrymore playing themselves in a plot which involves Kyser producing an adaptation featuring \\"swing musician Romeo Smith and opera singer Juliet Jones, with Juliet's father, a devotee of classical music, as obstacle to their romance.\\"Sanders, Julie \\"Shakespeare and Music: Afterlives and Borrowings\\" (Polity Press, 2007, ) p.24 Andr√© Cayatte's Les Amants de V√©rone (France, 1949) features Georgia (Anouk Aim√©e), the daughter of the declining Maglia family (roughly the equivalent of Shakespeare's Capulets) who meets her Romeo in working-class Angelo (Serge Reggiani) while working as stand-ins for the actors playing Romeo and Juliet in a film of the play.Rosenthal, p.211 The film is a melodramatic reworking of the Romeo and Juliet story, centering on the beauty and passion of the protagonists, and ending with their tragic deaths.Rosenthal, pp.211‚Äì2 The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing Romeo and Juliet has been used several times. The oddball 1944 B-movie Time Flies features the comedy duo Susie and Bill Barton, who, time travelling, encounter a Shakespeare struggling for words for his balcony scene, which Susie (Evelyn Dall) supplies from memory, while Bill interrupts with quips.Lanier, Douglas \\"Shakespeare: myth and biographical fiction\\" in Shaughnessy, Robert (ed.) \\"The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare and Popular Culture\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2007, ) p.96McKernan and Terris, p.146 John Madden's 1998 Shakespeare in Love depicts Shakespeare's process in composing Romeo and Juliet against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. Writers Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard exploited another commonplace of Shakespeare-related films, which scholar Tony Howard describes as the \\"playing Shakespeare is a gateway to self-fulfilment\\" plot.Howard, p.310. As he explains it, \\"an ill-matched crew of Elizabethan theatre people are transformed and united by the process of creating Romeo and Juliet\\". The film's climax includes Judi Dench's Elizabeth I declaring that Shakespeare's play \\"can show us the very truth and nature of love.\\"Howard, p.310; Rosenthal, p.228 =Screen performances= For comprehensive list, see Romeo and Juliet (films). =Films/books inspired by the play= *Beneath the 12 Mile Reef (USA, 1953) transposes the general plot of the play to rival fishing families in Depression-era Florida. *Romanoff and Juliet (USA, 1960) is a film of Peter Ustinov's theatrical Cold War adaptation. *West Side Story (USA, 1961) is the film of a Broadway musical adaptation of the Romeo and Juliet story, set in 1950s New York, by Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins directors Natalie Wood as Maria Richard Beymer as Tony *Romie-0 and Julie-8 (Canada, 1979) is a made-for-television animated film in which the two leads are depicted as robots made by rival companies who fall in love.

One of the area's leading early farmhouses, it has been designated a historic site. In the early 19th century, New Jersey native Isaac Edwards purchased land in the Virginia Military District from other early residents; part of his new property comprised a farm in District Land Grant 427 with an extant log cabin. Here, adjacent to Isaac's own property, settled his son, William. Before long, the log cabin proved insufficient for his family's needs, so in 1840 Edwards arranged for the construction of a new brick structure. This building, the present house, was constructed with many elements of the stylish Greek Revival mode of architecture, but it also combined some non-Greek elements, such as the gambrel roof.

Nearly a century later, architectural historians praised it as being one of the best local examples of early agricultural architecture in Anderson Township. In recognition of the historic importance of its architecture, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in late 1989, along with a single outbuilding.

Mexico is in the top 45 countries where Christians are most persecuted.  Beginning of anticlericalism and persecution  In one form or another, anticlericalism has been a factor in Mexican politics since the Mexican War of Independence from the Spanish Empire (1810-1821), which is attributable to the frequent change in government and those governments' eagerness to access wealth in the form of the property of the Church.Ehler, Sidney Z. Church and State Through the Centuries p. 579, (1967 Biblo & Tannen Publishers) Mexico was born after its independence as a confessional state, with its first constitution (1824) stating that the religion of the nation was and would perpetually be Roman Catholic, and prohibiting any other religion.Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States (1824) After the Revolution of Ayutla (1854-1855), nearly all of the top figures in the government were Freemasons and fierce anticlericalists.Werner, Michael S., Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico, p. 88, Taylor and Francis 2001 In 1857 a Constitution was adopted under which Benito Ju√°rez attacked the property rights and possessions of the Church. The supporters of tradition backed the ill-fated Second Mexican Empire (1863-1867) supported by the Second French Empire. When Maximilian I of Mexico was deposed and killed, the country saw a series of anti-clerical governments. Then after the moderate Porfirio D√≠az there was a strong resurgence of anticlericalism. In 1917, a new Constitution was enacted, hostile to the Church and religion, which promulgated an anti-clericalism similar to that seen in France during the Revolution. The new Mexican Constitution was hostile to the Church as a consequence of the support given by Catholic church authorities to the dictatorship of Victoriano Huerta. The 1917 Constitution outlawed teaching by the Church, gave control over Church matters to the state, put all Church property at the disposal of the state, outlawed religious orders and foreign- born priests, gave states the power to limit or eliminate priests in their territory, deprived priests of the right to vote or hold office, prohibited Catholic organizations which advocated public policy and religious publications from commenting on policy, prohibited clergy from religious celebrations and from wearing clerical garb outside of a church, and deprived citizens of the right to a trial for violations of these provisions.Ehler, Sidney Z.

Mexican Politics: The Containment of Conflict p. 50, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 One political scientist stated that the gist of the 1917 constitution was to \\"effectively outlaw the Roman Catholic Church and other religious denominations\\";Toft, Monica Duffy, Daniel Philpott and Timothy Samuel Shah, God's Century: Resurgent Religion and Global Politics, p. 171, W.W.

But the military dictators of the 1920s were a lot more savage than Juarez.\\"Fox, Vicente and Rob Allyn Revolution of Hope p. 17, Viking, 2007 Fox goes on to recount how priests were killed for trying to perform the sacraments, altars were desecrated by soldiers, and freedom of religion outlawed by generals. Calles presidency and Cristero War As a reaction against the strict enforcement of the above anti-clerical articles in the constitution of 1917 in Mexico, specifically Article 130, armed conflict broke out in the Cristero War (also known as the Cristiada) of 1926 to 1929. This was a civil war between Catholic rebels called Cristeros and the anti-clerical Mexican government of the time that was mainly localized in central Western states in Mexico. Though conflict between church and state marked the presidency of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (1920‚Äì1924), who \\"accused the clergy of being insincere and of producing conflict\\" but \\"spoke of Jesus Christ as 'the greatest socialist who has been known to Humanity'\\",Edward J. Berbusse, S.J., \\"The Unofficial Intervention of the United States in Mexico's Religious Crisis, 1926-1930\\". The Americas 23.1 (July 1966): 31. it was with the election of President Plutarco El√≠as Calles in 1924 that anti-clerical laws were stringently applied throughout the country. Calles added a requirement that prohibited priests from ministering unless licensed by the state.Ehler, Sidney Z. Church and State Through the Centuries p. 580, (1967 Biblo & Tannen Publishers) State officials began to limit the number of priests so that vast areas of the population were left with no priest at all. Churches were expropriated for use as garages, museums and the like, and the Mexican bishops, deported or underground, as a last resort of protest suspended all remaining ministry and urged the people to protest the persecution of their faith. One contemporary is quoted as saying that \\"while President Calles is sane on all other matters, he completely loses control of himself when the matter of religion comes up, becomes livid in the face and pounds the table to express his hatred.\\"Qtd.

Wearing clerical garb outside of churches was outlawed during his rule and priests exercising their right of political speech could be imprisoned for five years. On November 18, 1926, Pope Pius XI promulgated the encyclical Iniquis afflictisque decrying the severe persecution of the faithful in Mexico and the deprivation of the rights of the faithful and the Church.[ON THE PERSECUTION OF THE CHURCH IN MEXICO ] Papal Encyclicals Online 1926 The formal rebellion began on January 1, 1927, with the \\"Cristeros\\" battle cry ¬°Viva Cristo Rey! (\\"Long live Christ the King!\\"). When Jalisco federal commander General Jes√∫s Maria Ferreira moved on the rebels, he calmly stated that \\"it will be less a campaign than a hunt.\\" Just as the Cristeros began to hold their own against the federal forces, the rebellion was ended by diplomatic means, in large part due to the pressure of United States Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow. The war had claimed the lives of some 90,000: 56,882 on the federal side, 30,000 Cristeros. Numerous civilians and Cristeros were killed in anticlerical raids, while Cristeros killed atheist teachers and people suspected of supporting the government, and also blew up a passenger train.Davis, Mike. City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles (New Edition). Verso. 1990. 331.Hodges, Donald Clark and Gandy, Daniel Ross. Mexico, the End of the Revolution. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2002. 49. On September 29, 1932 Pope Pius XI issued a second encyclical on the persecution, Acerba Animi. The effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed.Van Hove, Brian Blood-Drenched Altars Faith & Reason 1994 Where there were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination.Scheina, Robert L. Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791-1899 p. 33 (2003 Brassey's) By 1935, 17 states had no priest at all.Ruiz, Ram√≥n Eduardo Triumphs and Tragedy: A History of the Mexican People p.393 (1993 W. W. Norton & Company) The persecution was worst under the rule of Tabasco's governor Tom√°s Garrido Canabal. His rule, which marked the apogee of Mexican anti- clericalism, was supported by his Radical Socialist Party of Tabasco (PRST). In 1916 his predecessor Francisco J. M√∫gica had restored the name of the state capital Villa Hermosa de San Juan Bautista (\\"Beautiful Town of St. John the Baptist\\") to Villahermosa (\\"Beautifultown\\").Enciclopedia de Municipios de M√©xico, Tabasco-Centro Garrido Canabal founded several fascist paramilitary organizations \\"that terrorized Roman Catholics\\",\\"Garrido Canabal, Tom√°s\\".

The Catholic Church has recognized several of those killed in connection with the Cristero rebellion as martyrs. Perhaps the best-known is Miguel Pro, SJ. This Jesuit priest was shot dead by firing squad on November 23, 1927, without benefit of a trial, on trumped-up charges. The Calles government hoped to use images of the execution to scare the rebels into surrender, but the photos had the opposite effect. Upon seeing the photos, which the government had printed in all the newspapers, the Cristeros were inspired with a desire to follow Father Pro into martyrdom for Christ. His beatification occurred in 1988. On May 21, 2000, Pope John Paul II canonized a group of 25 martyrs from this period (they were previously beatified on November 22, 1992.) For the most part, these were priests who did not take up arms, but refused to leave their flocks, and were killed by federal forces. Thirteen additional victims of the anti-Catholic regime have been declared martyrs by the Catholic Church, paving the way to their beatification. These are primarily lay people, including the 14-year-old Jos√© S√°nchez del R√≠o. The requirement that they did not take up arms, which was applied to the priest martyrs, does not apply to the lay people, though it had to be shown that they were taking up arms in self-defense.  Mid- twentieth century  As Mexico entered the mid-twentieth century, the more violent oppression of earlier in the century had waned but the Church remained severely suppressed. By 1940 it \\"legally had no corporate existence, no real estate, no schools, no monasteries or convents, no foreign priests, no right to defend itself publicly or in the courts. ...Its clergy were forbidden to wear clerical garb, to vote, to celebrate public religious ceremonies, and to engage in politics,\\" but the restrictions were not always enforced.Mabry, Donald J. \\"Mexican Anticlerics, Bishops, Cristeros, the Devout during the 1920s: A Scholarly Debate.\\" Journal of Church and State 20, 1: 82 (1978). Open hostility toward the Church largely ceased with the election of Manuel √Åvila Camacho (1940‚Äì46), who agreed, in exchange for the Church's efforts to maintain peace, to non-enforcement of most of the anticlerical provisions, an exception being Article 130, Section 9, which deprived the Church of the right of political speech, the right to vote, and the right of free political association.Mexico: Church State Relations Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress June 1996 Removal of many anticlerical provisions from the constitution In 1991 President Salinas proposed the removal of most of the anticlerical provisions from the constitution, a move which passed the legislature in 1992.

Among its most distinctive elements are the gables on the ends, the interior chimneys that rise from above these gables, and a two- story porch on the western front. It was originally erected near a gate on the toll road between Cincinnati and Brookville, Indiana; its name is derived from its location, approximately eighteen miles from Cincinnati in the city's early years. Besides serving its purpose as a tavern and thus an inn, the Eighteen Mile House operated as a post office in its first years of existence. As time passed, the house was modified at an unknown date under the supervision of an unknown individual, being expanded on its northern side. During the middle of the nineteenth century, the Civil War directly affected the Eighteen Mile House twice. According to local legend, Abraham Lincoln stayed in the house at least once, while Morgan's Raiders attacked the property in the middle of 1863.

The position evolved from the ancient chief pledge of a tithing, and takes its name from the office of constable, with which it was originally unconnected. It is distinct from the more senior position of the hundred-constable, also known as the High Constable (e.g. the High Constable of Holborn, who was one of the hundred- constables for Ossulstone; Ossulstone's hundred court was located at Red Lion Square, in Holborn). In London (excluding the City of London), the position was superseded by the introduction of the Metropolitan Police Service in 1829, which created a full-time professional force. Elsewhere, professional county police forces took over, after the County Police Act 1839 was passed. History of the position = Origin = The office of parish constable originated from the tithing, a small unit of local administration. Each tithing was obliged, by frankpledge, to be responsible for the actions of its members. The heads of each household would often select one of their number to take charge of the tithing - the chief pledge; in Kent, Sussex, and parts of Surrey, this head man was instead known as a headborough. A judicial process - view of frankpledge - obliged each tithing to attend the shire court at regular intervals, and hand over any person in their tithing who the court had summoned; if they did not, and could not swear on oath that they were not involved in helping that person evade justice, the remaining people in the tithing had to pay the damages incurred by the actions of that person. Since this created an incentive for each tithing to enforce standards of behaviour among its own members, the chief pledge of each tithing was effectively obliged to police behaviour in the tithing. = The emergence of constables = The term constable was originally unconnected with the chief pledge, and referred to officers in charge of the cavalry; it originates from the Latin comes stabuli, meaning count of the stable. By extension, constable referred to the officer in command of the army ‚Äì one of the Great Officers of State. In times of relative peace, this officer was sometimes given a role in keeping order, on account of his command of military resources. Additional constables were sometimes appointed, if order needed to be kept in multiple places, or the main constable was busy in his main role. The term constable consequently began to have a more general meaning related to enforcing order;p72, Bruce, Alistair, Keepers of the Kingdom (Cassell, 2002), in 1285 King Edward I of England \\"constituted two constables in every hundred to prevent defaults in towns and highways\\".p276-7, Markham, Sir Frank, History of Milton Keynes and District, vol.1 (1973), In England and Scotland, the officer in command of the army then came to be called the Lord High Constable, to avoid ambiguity over his role. As the chief pledge were also involved in policing people's behaviour, though at a much smaller scale, and with much-lowered resources, they gradually came to be referred to as petty constables. Tithings were originally connected with the hundred, but the courts baron introduced by the feudal system, attracted more attention, and the significance of the hundreds decreased. To shift the balance of power away from feudal lords again, magistrates were introduced, and the kings gradually transferred various functions to them, including from the shire courts. In 1381, magistrates acquired responsibility for the remains of view of frankpledge, thereby gaining oversight of the activity of petty constables. The feudal system had gradually been weakened over the Middle Ages, and by the time of the Reformation, the focus of local administration had shifted away from manors and towards civil parishes. Tithings consequently came to be seen as a division of the parish, and so petty constables became seen as parish constables; there are records of parish constables by the 17th century in the county records of Buckinghamshire. = Functions of parish constables = Parish constables derived most of their powers from their local parish. Traditionally, they were elected by the parishioners (just as the tithing had chosen their chief pledge forebears), but from 1617 onwards were typically appointed by the magistrates in each county. It was, however, only in 1842 that the power to appoint constables was formally stripped from manorial courts, and transferred to civil parishes. Although the constables had had to be sworn into their role by the magistrates, magistrates had never formally had the power to actually choose them. Like many official positions at the time, the position was obligatory, and unpaid, although the chosen constable had the right to employ someone to perform the role on their behalf. It was often a resented burden, as it involved a wide variety of extremely time consuming tasks. In accordance with the ancient obligation for tithings to present indicted individuals to the courts, each civil parish typically had a small location in which the constable could confine criminals. The constable was responsible not only for confining such people, but also for delivering them to the courts. Similarly, constables were also expected to try and prevent crime within their parish; they were among the people with authority to read the Riot Act, and were expected to do so if a riotous assembly arose in their parish. Vagabonds and beggars could be a drain on parish resources, under the Elizabethan Poor Law. They could also be a potential source of crime. Constables were expected to implement the Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1494, under which vagabonds and beggars were to be set in the stocks for three days, and then whipped until they leave the parish. The constable also had general responsibility for the local stocks, as well as for the pillory, and was expected to punish poachers, drunks, hedge-damagers, prostitutes, church- avoiders, and fathers of bastards. Just as the tithing was a general administrative unit, and not exclusively limited to policing matters, so the parish constable had functions that would not be recognised as police matters, unlike hundred-constables (which had derived from the military constable). Parish constables were expected to monitor trading standards and pubs, catch rats, restrain loose animals, light signal beacons, provide local lodging and transport for the military, perform building control, attend inquests, and collect the parish rates. They were also responsible for collecting national taxes, within their area. = Professionalisation = The historian Stephen Inwood describes the 4,000 parish constables existing in the early 19th century as \\"of variable quality and commitment\\"; some London parishes, such as Kensington, Fulham and Deptford (with over 55,000 inhabitants between them at the time of the 1821 census) had no policing at all, and the quality of policing was generally considered inadequate by this period.p591, Inwood, Stephen, A History of London (Macmillan, 1998), The Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and County Police Act 1839 gradually led to the end of most unprofessional constabulary. The Metropolitan Police Act established a professional and trained police force, in place of the parish constables, within the bounds of London; the County Police Act allowed counties to do likewise. Each new force was to be headed by a chief constable (replacing the hundred-constables) who would be appointed by the county magistrates. The wide administrative functions of parish constables were taken over by various recently established local boards (which eventually were re-organised to become local councils). The voluntary nature of the County Police Act meant that the change proceeded in a piecemeal fashion. The first county to establish a professional force was Wiltshire, which appointed its first chief constable on 28 November 1839;Wiltshire Constabulary History , Wiltshire Police website Essex followed a few months later, appointing its first Chief Constable on 11 February 1840.The Making of a Chief Constable , Essex Police website The City of London had been exempted from the Metropolitan Police Act, and had to use a private act of parliament to establish its own professional force as the City of London Police. In Guernsey and Jersey, parish constables still exist as elected parish officers.

Recently a visiting professor at Lycoming College and Heidelberg University of Applied Sciences, Heidelberg University of Applied Sciences Shuch continues to volunteer as the Executive Director Emeritus of The SETI League, Inc.http://www.setileague.org He has taught physics, astronomy, and engineering on various university campuses for over four decades. He is also active in science fiction fandom and filk music. Early life Born Howard Paul Wakes in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Shuch later adopted the name of his stepfather, physicist Milton L. Shuch (12 Oct 1922 - 20 Jan 2014). Shuch earned a Bachelor of Science in industrial technology from San Jose State University and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. Shuch is a Vietnam War-era United States Air Force veteran and active instrument flight instructor. After his military career he worked as an engineer for several Silicon Valley aerospace companies before commencing his academic career. He founded Microcomm Consultinghttp://microcomm.net in 1975, where in 1978 he designed and produced a commercial home satellite television receiver. SETI activities Shuch first learned about Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), from Nicholas Marshall, W6OLO, a Hungarian engineer with whom he served on the Board of Project OSCAR, builders of the world's first non-Government satellite. Marshall introduced Shuch to longtime SETI proponent Bernard M. Oliver, then vice-president of Engineering at the Hewlett-Packard Company. Oliver in turn introduced Paul to SETI pioneers Frank Drake and Philip Morrison, who encouraged his continued interest and involvement in the development of SETI radio telescopes, as a spin-off from his design of early satellite TV receivers. While in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, Shuch became acquainted with most of the members of the NASA SETI team in nearby Mountain View. Many SETI pioneers had been affiliated with Berkeley, either as faculty members, students, or postdoctoral researchers, and a SETI-friendly environment (some have called it a 'SETI cabal') persists there. Among Shuch's professors was the prominent radio astronomer William J. \\"Jack\\" Welch, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, who further encouraged Shuch's SETI activities. One of Shuch's classmates in Welch's radio telescope design course was Dan Werthimer, who went on to become chief scientist of the SETI@home distributed computing experiment. When the NASA SETI program was cancelled by the United States Congress in 1993, New Jersey industrialist Richard Factor established the nonprofit, membership-supported SETI League, which he invited Shuch to head. Shuch became the organization's first Executive Director, a position he now holds on an emeritus basis. He designed the hardware and protocols for, and remains Principal Investigator on, the SETI League's Project Argus all-sky survey. Shuch is principal investigator for the Invitation to ETI , a web- based SETI experiment initiated by his colleague, Allen Tough. Along with Ivan Almar of the Konkoly Observatory, Budapest, Shuch developed the San Marino Scale , an analytical tool for quantifying the significance of transmissions from Earth into Space.Almar, Ivan, \\"Shouting in the jungle: the SETI transmission debate.\\" Journal of the British Interplanetary Society 60(4):142-146, April 2007 Honors and awards *1999 Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society *2007 Full Member of the International Academy of Astronautics References External links *IAA SETI Permanent Study Group *Invitation to ETI *Microcomm Consulting *Project Argus *San Marino Scale *SearchLites *SETI League Category:American astronomers Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Amateur radio people Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:West Valley College alumni Category:Hertz Foundation ","title":"H.

For example, an index option, where a number of stocks have been grouped together in an index and the option is based on the price of the index. Unlike a rainbow option which considers a group of assets but ultimately pays out on the level of one, a basket option is written on a basket of underlying assets but will pay out on a weighted average gain of the basket as a whole.Choudhry, Moorad. Bond and money markets: strategy, trading, analysis. Butterworth-Heinemann, 2003. p.838 Like rainbow options basket options are most commonly written on a basket of equity indices, though they are frequently written on a basket of individual equities as well. For example, a call option could be written on a basket of ten healthcare stocks, where the basket was composed of ten stocks in weighted proportions. The strike price X is usually set at the current value of the basket (at-the-money), and the payoff profile will be max(S ‚àí X, 0) where S is a weighted average of n asset prices at maturity, and each weight represents the percentage of total investment in that asset.Zhang, Peter G. Exotic options: a guide to second generation options. 1997. p553 Pricing and valuation Basket options are usually priced using an appropriate industry- standard model (such as Black‚ÄìScholes) for each individual basket component, and a matrix of correlation coefficients applied to the underlying stochastic drivers for the various models. While there are some closed-form solutions for simpler cases (e.g. two-color European rainbows),Rubinstein, Mark. \\"Exotic options.\\" No. RPF-220. University of California at Berkeley, 1991.

Lognormality Problems in hedging basket options can be of some significance when dealing with markets that exhibit a strong skew. Many operators price basket options as if the underlying basket were a single commodity following its own stochastic process with its volatility derived from its own time series. This however conflicts with a fact that an average (or any linear combination) of assets with lognormal distribution does not follow lognormal distribution.Taleb, Nassim. Dynamic hedging: managing vanilla and exotic options. Vol. 64. John Wiley & Sons, 1997. p.391 This problem arises in swaps and Eurodollar strips (baskets of Eurodollar options) but in equities and fixed income it is mitigated by the fact that when correlation between assets is high, the sum would come closer to a lognormally distributed asset.

Career Unison spent most of her wartime career in the Mediterranean, where she sank the Italian merchants Enrichetta, Marco Foscarini and Terni, the Italian sailing vessels Luigi Verni, Carlo P. and Angela, the German coaster Jaedjoer and the Italian tanker Zeila. She also damaged the Italian tanker Pozarica, and unsuccessfully torpedoed the Italian merchant Chisone and a medium-sized tanker. identified as the Italian auxiliary Cerere. She took part in operation Harpoon, when she torpedoed an Italian cruiser force composed of the light cruisers and without hitting any target on 13 June 1942. On 2 August 1943 Unison was fired on in error by the American tanker Yankee Arrow off Cape Bon, causing damage to her pressure hull, although she was able to return to dock at Bizerte under her own power. The attack killed the officer of the watch, and severely injured three other crew members, including her captain, Lieutenant Anthony Daniell DSO DSC. She was transferred to the Soviet Navy on 26 June 1944, and renamed V3. She spent five years in Soviet service, being returned in 1949 and scrapped at Stockton in May 1950. During War Week, March 1942, HMS Unison was adopted by the people of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Both the Rural District Council and the Urban District Council of Ashby were later presented with plaques commemorating their support for the vessel and her crew. These plaques were recently discovered, reunited and presented to Ashby de la Zouch Museum where they will soon be on display.

It lies about east of Liverpool city centre. History Court Hey Park can be traced back to 1783 when it was a farmer's field forming part of the estate of Lord Derby. The grounds were acquired by Robertson Gladstone (1805‚Äì1875) who was elder brother to the four times Prime Minister, William Gladstone. Robertson Gladstone married Mary Ellen Heywood-Jones in January 1836 and the mansion house, Court Hey Hall, was built the same year in the walled estate. Gladstone, who was a director of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, acquired the original sandstone railway sleepers once traversed by George Stephenson's world famous locomotive Rocket in 1842 when the railway was renovated. These were used to edge the main drives of the park and are still prominent today. The hall remained in the Gladstone family until the death of one of Robertson Gladstone's sons in 1919. In the same year it was bought by J. Bibby and Sons, a cattle food manufacturer. They established an experimental poultry and cattle feed farm and developed the park as a centre for sport and recreation. Recreation continued alongside a printing business, which was established in the grounds in 1923. Football, tennis, bowls and cricket were played in the park, while the hall was used for ballroom dances, billiards and other social activities. During the Second World War, part of the estate including the stable block was requisitioned by the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Foods and used as a quarantine station. From the late 1940s Liverpool Pembroke, an athletic and cycling club, also used the park as a base until redevelopment forced them to move in the 1960s. The hall and grounds fell into disrepair and in 1951 the company sold the estate to Huyton-with-Roby Council. The hall was demolished in 1956 and part of the land sold to Vernons Pools. A housing estate was established, now called the Grangewood/High Beeches Estate. The original entrance to the Vernons factory runs alongside the eastern side of the estate. The stable buildings and sections of the original walled garden were the home of the National Wildflower Centre between 2000 and 2017.

She has also appeared in All Pro Wrestling, Ring of Honor and toured Mexico with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling participating in an interpromotional event between TNA and Lucha Libre AAA World Wide in September 2006. Career =Early life and career= Growing up in South Palm Beach, Florida, Ringer began watching World Championship Wrestling professional wrestling with her older brothers during the early 1990s and later became a fan of Chris Jericho. While in high school, Ringer became involved in girl's varsity rugby as well as amateur wrestling winning four gold medals and qualifying for Provincials during her two-year career. Although leaving the wrestling team prior to graduation choosing to focus on her dancing career, she studied Muay Thai after leaving high school. During this time, she became associated with several independent wrestlers while working as a hostess for a local restaurant and was eventually introduced to one of these wrestlers Rob \\"El Fuego\\" Etcheverria by his fiance who was a client of her mother, a professional trainer. Moving to Toronto, Ontario in early 2003, she began training under Etcheverria at Squared Circle and later continued to train occasionally with Scott D'Amore and Tyson Dux in Windsor before making her professional debut in June 2004. That same year she was featured in the two- part wrestling documentary Slam Bam which aired on the Discovery Channel. =Shimmer Women Athletes and Blood Sweat and Ears= After a year in Etcheverria's Squared Circle promotion, Ringer also competed in several Ontario-based independent promotions including New Vision Pro Wrestling defeating Rossana, 21st Century Fox and fellow Squared Circle Training graduate Shantelle Taylor in a 4-way elimination match to win the NVPW Women's Championship in late-2004 before losing the title to Taylor in mid-2005. Ringer joined SHIMMER Women Athletes later that year where she quickly became involved in a feud with Shantelle Taylor losing to her on the company's debut event Volume 1 on November 6, 2005 although she would defeat Taylor & Ariel in a tag team match with Cheerleader Melissa on Volume 2 which was taped later that same night. Their feud would continue during the next year as Ringer faced Taylor in several single matches all over the North American independent circuit including in the Ontario-based BSE Pro. On February 12, 2006, Ringer took part in the tapings of SHIMMER's Volumes 3 and 4 where she was defeated by Cindy Rogers, in a three-way match with Amber O'Neal, and Allison Danger, in a singles match, respectively. Appearing on several events for Blood Sweat and Ears during the next two months, Ringer would lose to Shantelle Taylor in a 3-way match with Danyah Rays on February 26 and on March 19 she teamed with Rays losing to Shantelle Taylor & Traci Brooks. On March 30, 2006, she made her Ring of Honor debut in a \\"SHIMMER Showcase\\" dark match at Dragon Gate Challenge where she and Lacey defeated Taylor and Allison Danger in a tag team match. On May 7. 2006, Ringer returned to Blood Sweat and Ears defeating Taylor and Traci Brooks in a tag team match with Gail Kim as her partner, and Taylor and Ariel with Cheerleader Melissa as her partner later that same night. She spent the rest of the summer competing in various independent promotions in Ontario including Great Canadian Wrestling, Motor City Wrestling and the Pure Wrestling Association. =From San Francisco to Ontario= In September 2006 Ringer participated in All Pro Wrestling's ChickFight tournament and lost to KAORU via rear naked choke knockout in the opening rounds in San Francisco, California on September 2. The following night, she lost to Hailey Hatred in a four-way match with Allison Danger and MsChif. After defeating Tracy Brooks at a Blood Sweat and Ears event on September 10, Ringer made her wrestling debut in Mexico on September 17, when she wrestled at an interpromotional event held by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Lucha Libre AAA World Wide at the Arena Cuatro Caminos de Nuevo Laredo where she teamed up with Traci Brooks to defeat Estrellita and Tiffany. On October 22, 2006, Ringer picked up her first one-on-one SHIMMER victory when she defeated \\"Country Girl\\" Lorelei Lee on Volume 7.

He was born in Virginia, Minnesota, and currently resides in Buford, Georgia. He used to compete in the NHRA‚Äôs POWERade Drag Racing series, driving a Chevrolet Cobalt in the Pro Stock category. His primary sponsor was ACDelco, whom he drove for since 1996. Early career Born in Virginia, Minnesota, Kurt was immersed in his father‚Äôs (Hall of Fame Pro Stock racer Warren Johnson) racing efforts from the start. He traveled with his family to races around the country, and started by odd jobs with the three-person crew (including his father and mother Arlene), beginning with sweeping floors at the shop. It was through these jobs that Kurt learned the business. According to Kurt, he was ‚Äúnever pushed to stay involved,‚Äù but got ‚Äúhooked‚Äù on racing. With each passing season, Kurt‚Äôs responsibilities grew from cleaning parts and loading the trailer to assisting with tuning decisions, until soon he was assembling the 500 cubic-inch engines that would power his father to many wins and six championships. Kurt would eventually become his father‚Äôs crew chief, guiding the family‚Äôs second team to Top Five points finishes in 1991 and 1992. Racing career Originally sent by Warren to Roy Hill‚Äôs racing school to improve the dialogue between driver and crew chief, the move led Kurt to consider getting behind the wheel. He made his competitive driving debut in a Pro Stock Oldsmobile Cutlass at the 1993 NHRA Winternationals in Pomona, CA, qualifying fifteenth, and won two rounds before being narrowly defeated by former teammate Scott Geoffrion in the semi-finals. Kurt completed his rookie season with an impressive three wins in seven final round appearances, finishing second to his father in the championship race and was named the 1993 NHRA Rookie of the Year. On May 20, 1994, he earned a permanent place in NHRA history by recording the first Pro Stock six-second pass, with his 6.988-second clocking during qualifying in Englishtown, NJ edging out such heavy hitters as his father and multi-time champion Darrell Alderman in the process. In 1996, Kurt joined forces with sponsor ACDelco. Kurt‚Äôs success continued over the next years, with consecutive titles at the prestigious U.S. Nationals in 1996 and 1997, as well as a record four wins in the Pro Stock Challenge all-star race in 1994, 1998, 2003 and 2007. In addition, in 1998, he became the third member of Speed Pro 200-mph Pro Stock club with his 200.13 mph run in Gainesville, FL. Kurt has also continually shown his prowess as a driver. For example, en route to winning the 2005 ACDelco Las Vegas Nationals in Las Vegas, Nevada, Kurt not only set low elapsed time and top speed of the event, but also used a .002 reaction to eliminate arch-rival Greg Anderson on a 6.839 ‚Äì 6.821-second holeshot, his second such win of the day. Since 2005, Kurt has logged four additional wins, including the SummitRacing.com Nationals in Las Vegas, NV (2006), Carquest Auto Parts Nationals in Joliet, IL (2006), O‚ÄôReilly Mid-South Nationals in Memphis, TN (2006), and Checker Schuck‚Äôs Kragen Nationals in Phoenix, Arizona (2007). These wins extended Kurt‚Äôs fourteen-year streak of winning at least one race a year, which is the second longest streak among all NHRA professional categories. Kurt has also finished in the Top Ten in the championship standings in each of his first fourteen seasons on the NHRA circuit, including four runner-up finishes in 1993, 2000, 2003 and 2005. Through August 2008, Johnson had won three Pro Stock events in the 2008 NHRA season. Personal life Away from the track, Kurt enjoys spending time with his wife Kathy and their three children, Conner, Erin and Jarrett at their home in Buford, Georgia. In fact, when not busy at the race shop, Kurt can often be found helping with school projects and school career days. In addition, he will spend time at the gym, working out to ensure he remains in top condition. Kurt‚Äôs father, Warren, is also an accomplisher drag racer in the NHRA's Pro Stock division. In the 2003 NHRA season Kurt finished second to his father in the championship race, which was the first 1-2 father- son finish in NHRA history, as well as recording the first father-son final round pairing at the 1993 Atlanta event. Career highlights First Pro Stock driver in NHRA history to run a 6-second elapsed time (6.988 seconds, Englishtown, N.J. on May 20, 1994); first member of Holley 6-Second Pro Stock Club. 1993 NHRA Rookie of the Year (won three events and finished second to his father, Warren, in championship) 39 NHRA national event victories (fifth among Pro Stock drivers) 66 final-round appearances (35 wins and 30 runners- up) Third Member of Speed-Pro 200 mph Pro Stock Club (ran 200.13 mph on March 14, 1998) 27 career No. 1 qualifiers Winning streak: Won at least one national event for fourteen consecutive years.

The 51,000 square foot building with its Idaho quartzite fa√ßade was inspired by the ruins of Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and echoes the hillside behind the facility. Located on a bluff called East Gros Ventre Butte in the midst of a real wildlife habitat, the institution overlooks the National Elk Refuge and is situated 2.5 miles north of the town of Jackson. The core of the collections reflects traditional and contemporary realism. The museum's centerpiece is a collection of works by Carl Rungius (1869-1959) and Bob Kuhn (1920-2007). In addition to 14 galleries, the museum has a sculpture trail, museum shop, restaurant, children's discovery gallery, and library. More than 80,000 people visit every year, and over 10,000 children visit the museum each year, often as part of their school curricula. The Museum is a nonprofit, with a mission to collect, display, interpret, and preserve the highest quality North American wildlife art, supplemented by wildlife art found throughout the world, while enriching and inspiring appreciation and knowledge of humanity's relationship with nature. History The museum was founded in 1987 by William and Joffa Kerr and a group of friends. It was initially situated on the Jackson Town Square and was at first called the Wildlife of the American West Museum.Wilkinson, Todd, \\"America's Shrine for Wildlife Art\\", Western Art & Architecture, Spring 2009. The Kerrs donated the core of the museum's holdings from their own collection. In 1994, the NMWA opened a facility north of its previous location, across Highway 89 from the National Elk Refuge. In September 2007, the museum dedicated a new monumental sculpture of five elk called Wapiti Trail by American sculptor Bart Walter. Collections As of 2012 there were more than 5,000 cataloged artworks and 550 artists represented in the museum's permanent collection. Characteristic examples, along with those of Rungius and Kuhn, include works by Albert Bierstadt, George Catlin, Karl Bodmer, Charles Marion Russell, Frederic Remington, John James Audubon, N.C. Wyeth, Friedrich Wilhelm Kuhnert, Bruno Liljefors, Robert Bateman, Simon Gudgeon, Tucker Smith, and Mark Catesby. Additionally, there are works depicting wildlife by Auguste Rodin, Picasso, Rembrandt, Archibald Thorburn, Daniel Huntington, Rosa Bonheur, Georgia O'Keeffe, Walton Ford, Andy Warhol and Kendra Haste. Sculpture Trail Wapiti Trail bronze sculpture by Bart Walter The museum's Sculpture Trail, designed by award-winning landscape architect Walter J. Hood, opened in fall 2011. The three-quarter-mile long trail extends to the north and south of the museum. When complete, the trail will host 30 permanent and temporary works of art; twenty works of art are installed. The trail branches into several footpaths with bridges and staircases giving access to a variety of vantage points and views. Free and open to the public, the Sculpture Trail is proximate to the main bike pathway into Jackson from the north and south. The pathway connects to the Sculpture Trail via an underpass, providing access to the town of Jackson and Grand Teton National Park. Education Fables, Feathers & Fur is a weekly reading and art-making program for children ages 3-6. The museum offers several educational programs segmented by audience and type of learning strategy to accommodate a range of ages and learning styles, both formal and informal. The museum also facilitates an internationally competitive, well-funded, graduate- level internship program. The Lillian Thomason Gemar Internship in the Education and Exhibitions Department and the McGee Foundation Curatorial Internship in the Curatorial Department are the two primary internship opportunities. Internships are offered to current graduate students and recent graduates with requisite coursework, experience, and background. The museum also offers additional unpaid internships. Library and archives The Library is a non-circulating research library with an emphasis on material relating to wildlife art and artists. Additional material includes general art history, art conservation, natural history, wildlife biology, wildlife cinematography, conservation, and photography. The collection contains a wide variety of materials including books, journals, artist biographical files, video and DVD recordings, and Museum publications. The Library and Archives are open by appointment for browsing, reference, and research. Museum Shop The museum shop offers apparel and accessories that resonate with the theme of wildlife, including books, children's gifts, home furnishings, fine jewelry, stationery, posters and prints, and special exhibition items. Honors and awards In 1994, the National Museum of Wildlife Art received the Wyoming Humanities Award for exemplary efforts in fostering the humanities in Wyoming. On May 8, 2008, President George W. Bush signed Senate Bill 2739, a Public Lands bill that contained a provision recognizing the NMWA as the \\"National Museum of Wildlife Art of the United States\\".

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Ko≈Çaczyce. It lies approximately north of Jas≈Ço and south-west of the regional capital Rzesz√≥w. Ko≈Çaczyce was first mentioned in 1339, and gained town rights in 1354 to lose them in 1919. It regained town status on 1 January 2010, along with five other Polish localities.  History  The village of Kolaczyce was founded probably in late 13th century, as property of the Benedictine Abbey from Tyniec. In 1339, it received town charter from King Kazimierz Wielki. At that time, it was part of Sandomierz Voivodeship, in which it remained for the next 400 years, until the first partition of Poland (1772). In 1474, Kolaczyce was burned to the ground by a Hungarian raid commanded by Thomas Tarczay. In 1546, the town burned in a great fire, while in 1657, it was completely destroyed by Transilvanian forces of George II Rakoczi (see Swedish invasion of Poland). In the past, Kolaczyce was spelled Colanthicze 1330, Colaczicze 1358; and Colacice 1401. In 1772, Kolaczyce was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained in Austrian Galicia until November 1918. In 1919, it lost its town status, regaining it in 2010. In the 19th century, Kolaczyce was famous for its shoe makers, which annually made app. 40 000 pairs of shoes. In the Second Polish Republic, Kolaczyce belonged to Krakow Voivodeship. During World War II, the village suffered from heavy destruction; its Jewish minority was decimated. During the Second World War, Nazis gathered 260 Jews from the nearby town of Brzostek, and surrounding villages, marched them a few miles south along the road No. 73, and‚Äîhaving escorted them in groups of ten to a spot in the Podzamcze forest‚Äîkilled them and buried in a mass grave. The place is marked by a memorial officially unveiled on 17 June 2012.

History  =Founding and early years= The paper was founded in 1860, with as the first Editor and SVP member, Denis Lane, the printer. The first copies of The Universe were published on Saturday, December 8, 1860 ‚Äì at a cover price of one penny ‚Äì from 43 Lamb‚Äôs Conduit Street, London WC. The front page announced that ‚Äúa cheap Catholic newspaper is required ‚Äì if only to stay the circulation of anti-Catholic weekly newspapers among Catholic families resident in London‚Äù. By selling the paper for just one penny a copy, The Universe said it hoped to be a weekly paper ‚Äúwithin the reach of all classes‚Äù. The Tablet, by comparison, cost 6d. By 1910, The Universe was giving news from all over the country, not just from London, and had started to produce photographs, mainly portraits of people mentioned in stories. It had by then also changed its address to 1 Racquet Court, Fleet Street, London EC. =Belloc - Wells controversy= In the early 1920, the Catholic historian Hilaire Belloc published in \\"The Universe\\" a long series of articles sharply criticizing H. G. Wells' historical textbook, The Outline of History. In Belloc's view, Wells' book included \\"a number of biased statements, intolerant statements and false assumptions\\" about Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular.Wells, H. G., The Outline of History, Garden City Publishing Company, Inc.; New York, 1930, page vi.Dickson, Lovat, H.G. Wells: His Turbulent Life and Times. Penguin Books, 1972, page 318.Wells, H. G., Outline, page vi. Wells responded to Belloc‚Äôs articles with a series of six of his own, and offered \\"The Universe\\" (and other Catholic magazines) the use of them for no payment - which was declined. Wells responded to the refusal in a letter to the Universe: A month later, the editor of the Universe offered Wells the opportunity of correcting definite points of fact upon which he might have been misrepresented.Wells, H. G., Mr. Belloc Objects, page vi. The editor added the stipulation that Wells would not be allowed to defend his views or examine Belloc's logic. Rather than accept these restrictions, Wells edited his articles and assembled them into a single volume, his Mr. Belloc Objects to \\"The Outline of History\\". =Later years= On Thursday 8 December 1960, The Universe, ‚ÄúThe Catholic Family Newspaper‚Äù, celebrated its centenary with a special front colour issue, carrying portraits of two Popes, Pope Pius IX (1860) and the much-loved Pope John XXIII, a flashback to the first front page and a fine drawing of St Peter‚Äôs, Rome. The cover price had increased to 4d and The Universes address was now Universe House, 21 Fleet Street. This edition sold 300,000 copies. On Friday 6 December 1985, The Universe celebrated its 125th anniversary. The price per copy had risen to 30p and the address was 33-39 Bowling Green Lane, London. On 7 October 1990, The Universe relocated to Manchester. It was a momentous occasion, not only in moving from Bowling Green Lane to Oxford Street, Manchester, but also in switching from contract typesetters to desktop publishing using Apple Mac computers. Later as literary editor of the Catholic weekly newspaper for over 15 years, the ex- Catholic Priest \\"by the name of Piers Compton\\" (1901-1986) published in 1981 the first edition of the unusual book entitled The Broken Cross: Hidden Hand In The Vatican and also in PDF format, withdrawn within weeks of its initial release, catalogued as a Reference Book and finally reprinted in 1983, shortly before his retirement. In April 2015, the paper moved its entire operation to the Guardian Print Centre in Manchester, where The Universe moved from a tabloid to the Guardians larger, and very modern, Berliner format. New sections were launched, including a weekly Around the Parishes supplement and a Weekend Companion pullout of family-centred non-religious news and features. The newspaper's editor (since 1995) is Joseph Kelly, who is also the CEO and Managing Editor of The Universes parent company, The Universe Media Group Ltd. The Universe Media Group also publishes The Catholic Times , The Official Catholic Directory of England & Wales, The Catholic Who's Who, Church & Heritage Building Journal, Novena, Vatican: Past and Present, From the Catholic Archives and other third party Catholic titles. In 2010 it was the official publisher and distributor for a number of UK papal visit publications and resources, including Heart to Heart, Welcome Pope Benedict, and the Official Papal Mass Book. In September 2018 it also published the Official Mass Book for Adoremus, the 2018 National Eucharistic Congress in Liverpool.

Story summary Firekeeper only vaguely remembers a time when she didn't live with her ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, a pack of \\"royal wolves\\" ‚Äì bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal wolves. Now, after years in the wild, a group of humans have come into the woods west of the Iron Mountains. The expedition is led by Norvin Norwood AKA Earl Kestrel in an attempt to find Prince Barden: the lost king's son and the most legitimate heir to the throne should he be found alive. However, the expedition soon discovers that Barden's settlement was destroyed in a terrible fire some ten years ago. Meanwhile, Firekeeper decides to reenter human society. Accompanied by her beloved pack mate Blind Seer, and their friend, a peregrine falcon named Elation, Firekeeper travels with the humans back to their kingdom of Hawk Haven. Upon arriving Firekeeper is officially adopted into Earl Kestrel's family and dubbed ‚ÄúBlysse Norwood‚Äù in honor of (and in hope that she may be) Prince Barden's only child. She gains friendship with Derian Carter, a man who was on the expedition and has been appointed her tutor in human customs. Also in Firekeeper's circle of friends is a doctor named Sir Jared (\\"Doc\\") and the young Lady Elise Archer. As Firekeeper learns about her new home she discovers the kingdom's troublesome search for an heir. King Tedric's children are all dead and now a number of nobles with blood ties to the royal family are looking to be next in line for the throne. As Firekeeper is suspected of being Prince Barden's daughter she is quickly thrown into the royal court's games of intrigue and manipulation. Soon the politics reach over the border to Hawk Haven's neighbor, the rival kingdom of Bright Bay, where King Tedric's nephew, Allister Seagleam, resides. As the process of naming an heir continues, Bright Bay's neighbors of Stonehold and Waterland are informed by Prince Newell (the scheming widower of King Tedric's late daughter) that Bright Bay's Queen Gustin IV has magical artifacts hidden away: a serious crime in these magic- phobic countries. Stonehold declares war and King Tedric decides to support Bright Bay. At the same time Firekeeper, Derian, Doc, and Lady Elise discover that Lady Melina Shield ‚Äî who seeks to have one of her own children named heir ‚Äî is placing magical control over her daughter, Sapphire, and her son, Jet. The four friends work to free not only Sapphire and Jet, but also Elise who comes under partial control due to her engagement to Jet. War breaks out near the Bright Bay-Hawk Haven border when Queen Gustin refuses to surrender the artifacts to Stonehold and Waterland. Elise and Doc are sent to work in the field hospitals for their known natural gifts in the healing arts. As they work side by side Elise develops feelings for Doc and her feelings for him grow. She does not, however, act upon these feelings due to his lesser rank and her engagement to Jet. Derian is chosen to be part of a small and carefully selected group that travels behind enemy lines and destroys Stonehold supplies. Firekeeper has been left out of the main fight and the sabotage mission. She does, however, manage to find ways of being helpful. She discovers a hidden archer that kills one of Bright Bay's noblemen. Firekeeper fights, defeats, and ties up the assassin. She also recognizes him as Prince Newell's servant and she soon realizes Prince Newell's plans to betray his country. Firekeeper and Blind Seer rush to King Tedric's camp. As Firekeeper comes to warn King Tedric, Zorana shoots her in the leg for fear of Firekeeper's strange behavior. Firekeeper continues on and arrives inside the tent. She finds Newell attempting to kill King Tedric. There is a fight, during which Zorana believes Firekeeper is the traitor and calls for back up. Firekeeper ends up killing Newell, but gets stabbed in the back herself. The last thing Firekeeper hears as she slides into unconsciousness is Blind Seer's mournful howl. Blind Seer and the peregrine falcon Elation race to find Derian, Elise, and Doc. The animals bring the humans to King Tedric's tent, where the sovereign is recovering from the ordeal. He recounts the events, clearing Firekeeper's name of any treachery. The war ends and Allister and Tedric turn the question of inheritance once more. Allister convinces Queen Gustin IV to abdicate her throne and become ruler of the smaller and newly created kingdom of The Isles. Allister will inherit the throne of Bright Bay and have his eldest son, Shad, marry Sapphire Shield. It is decided that when the marriage is official and King Tedric eventually leaves the throne, Bright Bay and Hawk Haven will be united into the single kingdom of Bright Haven. Firekeeper recovers from her injuries. Elise breaks her engagement to Jet. Firekeeper, Derian, Doc, and Lady Elise are all invited to Shad and Sapphire's wedding. Firekeeper worries she will never be able to see her wolf pack again. Earl Kestrel informs her she is allowed to return to the wilderness, but Firekeeper decides to remain with the humans until after winter. Main characters * Firekeeper - A barefoot girl who was raised amount the Royal Wolves (who are much bigger and more intelligent than normal Cousin wolves). She is the only survivor of Prince Barden's settlement and believed to be \\"Lady Blysse\\", Prince Barden's only child and heir. She soon finds herself unwillingly entered into a competition to become the next King or Queen of a land very different from the ones of wolves. * Blind Seer - A wolf from Firekeeper's pack who accompanies her to the humans. Blind Seer received his name because he has blue eyes and was believed at first to be blind, as normally wolves eyes are brown.

For instance, The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' definition specifies a \\"program with two (2) or more episodes with a total running time of at least 150 program minutes[,] that tells a complete, non-recurring story, and does not have an on-going storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons.\\" Limited-run series are represented in the form of telenovelas in Latin America, and serials in the United Kingdom. The shortest forms of limited-run series have two- or three-part, usually described as \\"made for television film\\" or miniseries; longer forms are often reality television or scripted dramas.  Parameters  Limited-run series with greater than 5 episodes do not have main characters recurring between seasons or a storyline that spans seasons. Series with 5 episodes or fewer per season‚Äîsuch as the BBC/Masterpiece coproduction Sherlock‚Äîalso are considered limited series due to their short run, even if main characters and story lines do travel across seasons. Series with a limited eight-to-twelve episode run are typically ordered to fill television networks' gap in midseason. An image from American Horror Story: Freak Show, one season of the ongoing anthology series.  Classification  Limited series differ from miniseries as the production has the potential to be renewed without a required number of episodes as a typical order per season. Under the Dome, Killer Women, and Luther were marketed as limited series. Individual season-length stories of anthology series such as American Horror Story, Fargo, and True Detective are also described as \\"limited series,\\" which the Primetime Emmys have changed to their miniseries/limited series category to accommodate. Actors may choose to take part in limited-run series because their set start and end dates make scheduling other projects easier.  History  In 2015, The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences changed its guidelines on how Emmy nominees are classified, with shows with a limited run all referred to as \\"limited series\\" instead of \\"miniseries.\\" This is a reversion back to 1974 when the category was named \\"outstanding limited series.\\" It had been changed to \\"outstanding miniseries\\" in 1986, and then added to the \\"made for television films\\" category in 2011. Miniseries were brought back out in 2014, accommodating such limited series as HBO‚Äôs Olive Kitteridge, History‚Äôs Texas Rising, IFC‚Äôs The Honorable Woman and PBS‚Äô Wolf Hall, and TV movies such as HBO‚Äôs Bessie and National Geographic‚Äôs Killing Jesus.  Development  = United States = Short term reality television like Bravo's Eat, Drink, Love, scripted dramas like Netflix's Black Mirror, and individual seasons of anthology series are examples of limited-run series that appear on American television networks. = Latin America = In the 1950s, telenovelas emerged as Latin limited series. These low-budget Spanish and Portuguese shows were modeled after American soap operas in style and form. These programs follow a story arc that ends at the end of a season, with the possibility of renewal for subsequent seasons. = United Kingdom = In British television, the term \\"serial\\" is used instead of \\"miniseries.\\" Like telenovelas, these programs are stand-alone dramas, with a conclusion at the last episode of the season.

Miranda- Ribeiro, 1911) Description Underside of a Pareiorhina hyptiorhachis Pareiorhina species all have lateral borders of the head without developed bristles, a naked abdomen, dorsal plates meeting along the mid-dorsal line between the dorsal and caudal fins, no adipose fin, ventral plates covering the midventral line, and the dorsal portion of body behind dorsal fin flatenned (flat caudal peduncle with a rectangular cross section). In P. carrancas and P. rudolphi, the teeth are simple, while in P. brachyrhyncha, the teeth have a minute lateral cusp at the base of the main cusp. P. brachyrhyncha and P. carrancas are unique in lacking an adipose fin and azygous plates; in loricariids without an adipose fin, it is usually replaced by a series of azygous plates that form a ridge. However, these two species lack both the fin and the ridge. These species range from about 4.1-4.5 centimetres (1.6-1.8 in) in length.

It begins in the north of the Tinogasta Department of Catamarca Province, at the confluence of several rivers created by the melting of snow and precipitation in the high Andean peaks, such as the volcano Nevado Incahuasi at , Cerro El Muerto at and Cerro Negro of Laguna Verde at , which dominates in addition the basin of Salina of Laguna Verde. At first the river is called R√≠o Chascuil, then, after having received a stream on the right, the collector of Cerro Cenizo, elevation , it becomes the R√≠o Guanch√≠n down to the spa town of Fiambal√° where there are hot springs. There, it receives on its left the R√≠o Fiambal√°, a periodic stream coming from the north which drains all the southern part of the Cordillera of San Buenaventura and the Sierra of Culampaj√°, very dry areas. It there takes the name R√≠o Abauc√°n, and makes its final orientation toward the south-east. It passes close to the town of Tinogasta, then constitutes the south-southeastern border of the basin of the Salar of Pipanaco, with which it happens that there is an interaction. From this section of its course, it is called the R√≠o Salado or Colorado or Bermejo. It passes into the province of La Rioja. Leaving the basin of Pipanaco, it threads its way between the Sierra of Ambato and the Sierra of Velasco. A little later it finishes its course by losing itself in a salt semi-desert called Desag√ºes del R√≠o Salado. Measurements made over nearly 40 years during the 20th century reveal a very reduced flow compared to the importance of its basin. In Tinogasta, it was an average of , with a daily maximum of . At this place, its basin already measures about , about the area of Belgium. The area of Tinogasta is an oasis well supplied with water by the Abauc√°n, as well as by aquifers, and is famous for its vineyards. Below Tinogasta, the flow of the river steadily decreases, it not receiving any further influx worth mentioning and losing its water by infiltration in highly permeable sandy zones and by evaporation due to the high temperatures on the plain. Nevertheless, it by and large provides enough water to supply the few human establishments located along its course. In the part of its course where it delimits the southern zone of the basin of the Salar of Pipanaco, its bed is at about the same level as the salar. In the event of significant rising of the streams of the salar, this last can overflow and send its water surplus into the R√≠o Abauc√°n, contributing greatly to its salinity. The opposite interaction can also occur. The important trunk road Route National 60, which connects C√≥rdoba to Chile through the Paso de San Francisco, elevation , follows the course of the R√≠o Abauc√°n for almost its entire length. Its mode is purely nival, tied to the snow melt of the Andean tops. Its basin has an area of , a little more than that of Switzerland.

Thirteen episodes of the series were made in total, with one story continuing through the episodes. They were made in 1991 and broadcast in 1992 on BBC One at 4:15. Fiddley Foodle Bird Information It was produced by H.A.P.P.Y. Animation and Fiddley Foodle Bird Productions in association with HIT Entertainment and was broadcast in over 30 different countries worldwide. The show also continued airing on the BBC until 2001. Plot The main character of the series is a bird, whose full name is the \\"Fiddley Foodle Bim Bam Boodle Oo Diddley-Doodle Oodle Bird\\". The character is voiced by Dennis Waterman (actor and singer famous for his roles as Terry McCann in Minder and Detective Sergeant George Carter in The Sweeney). The bird was originally nothing more than just a picture in a book, which was found by a young boy named Algernon. He wished that the bird would come to life, and when the wish came true they set out on an adventure with Algernon's friends, the eternally hungry Princess Toto, and his housekeeper, the overly strict Mrs. Grumblebaum. The aim of the mission is to find Algernon's lost parents, two members of the Potty Explorer's Club- Carzy and Maudy. They were lost exploring in a sieve. However, Algernon's dastardly Uncle Arbathnot is out to ensure that their mission does not succeed, and also to seize a mysterious treasure chest. He is assisted by a muscle-man named Damage, a Frenchman named Flannel, and a pirate named Pierre Head, who, like most pirates, is accompanied by a parrot  a wise-cracking green glove puppet. The show features a guest appearance from Cilla Black, who voiced the President of the Potty Explorer's Club.

It was released on the PlayStation Store in 2007 as the first title in the PixelJunk series. An updated version, PixelJunk Racers: 2nd Lap, was released in 2010. Gameplay A screenshot of gameplay in PixelJunk Racers. Bearing structural similarity to slot car racing games, the tracks of PixelJunk Racers consist of five separate lanes within which the cars move. The camera is always fixed above the circuit, giving an aerial overview of the entire track. The commands a player can execute are; changing lanes, controlling the throttle, and honking the horn. There are 32 gameplay modes available out of 16 core modes. Core racing modes have up to three levels of difficulty (Normal, Turbo and Master) varying with the speed of the gameplay. There is a total of 10 tracks on which each mode can be played. The single player mode includes a tournament, free racing (Quick Race), and Score Attack. In Score Attack, the player's best score in any mode is ranked online, and scores appear on PlayStation Network leaderboards. The multiplayer mode is exclusively offline, and up to seven players may simultaneously play the game on the same console. =2nd Lap= PixelJunk Racers 2nd Lap, an enhanced version of Racers, was released in 2010. 2nd Lap was made available for free to players who had already purchased the original Racers. 2nd Lap includes new game types, trophies, and a \\"Ghost Attack\\" mode in which players can race the recorded \\"ghosts\\" of any online player with registered high scores. Reception =PixelJunk Racers= Upon its release, PixelJunk Racers received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The variety of gameplay modes was praised by some critics, though IGN asserted that the \\"diverse game types can't quite save the core mechanics\\", calling them \\"aggravatingly repetitive\\". The difficulty of the game in general was unappealing to many reviewers. In a review from 1UP.com, a phenomenon was noted in which the enemy cars would fill up all five lanes, making them impassable. Gameplay instances such as this were described as \\"controller-hurlingly frustrating\\". Another significant criticism stems from the lack of online multiplayer capabilities. The only online component of the game involves comparing high scores with other players. However, PixelJunk Racers does support up to seven players offline; GameSpot suggested this feature would make it an enjoyable party game, even if organizing a seven- player session in one area could be considered a hassle. =2nd Lap= 2nd Lap received \\"average\\" reviews, albeit a bit more favorable than the original PixelJunk Racers, according to Metacritic.

Biography A native of Hy≈çgo prefecture, Fujiwara graduated from the 43rd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1931 and was assigned to the IJA 37th Infantry Regiment. After serving a tour of duty in Tianjin, China, he returned to the Army Staff College and graduated from the 50th class in 1938, whereupon he was assigned to the IJA 21st Army. In 1939, Fujiwara was transferred to the military intelligence unit within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, tasked with planning operations in south and Southeast Asia. He traveled to Bangkok in 1941, and joined the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group as Chief of Staff the same year. In 1941 Fujiwara established the F Kikan, a Japanese special operations unit, which was tasked with developing and assisting independence movements in British India, Malaya and Netherlands East Indies. In 1943, Fujiwara and his unit were transferred to the IJA 15th Army. F-Kikan greatly assisted in the establishment of the Indian National Army. Knowing of the long struggle of the Dutch to subdue Aceh province in northern Sumatra, and the ongoing resistance of the Acehnese period against Dutch rule, Fujiwara was ordered to make contact with the Aceh independence movements preparatory to the Japanese invasion of the Netherlands Indies. One of his first contacts was Sahid Abu Bakar, a religious teacher who lived in Kedah, who assisted him in recruiting a small organization to gather military intelligence, secure supplies, spread pro-Japanese propaganda, and to hinder Dutch efforts to sabotage local infrastructure. He also made contact with PUSA, the Islamic nationalist organization in Aceh, to start an armed rebellion. On the night of 11 March 1942, F-Kikan operatives and PUSA irregulars captured the Aceh capital of Banda Aceh. Thus, when the Japanese Imperial Guard Division landed the following morning, the city was already in Japanese hands.Axis History Forum Fujiwara subsequently served as Intelligence Officer on the staff of Fifteenth Army in Burma. He reconnoitered much of the northern part of the country in preparation for Operation U-Go, the offensive into British India. Following the failure of this offensive, almost all the staff of Fifteenth Army were transferred, although Fujiwara was the last to be reassigned, in December 1944.Louis Allen, Burma: The Longest War, p.386 After his recall to Japan, Fujiwara taught at the Army Staff College for a year, and was then transferred back to the field as Chief of Staff of the IJA 2nd Army in April 1945 and IJA 57th Army in June 1945. He was based in Singapore at the end of the war. Fujiwara was one of the few officers of the Imperial Japanese Army to make the transition to the postwar Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, commanding the Home Defense Force in 1955, and the 1st District Corps -Tokyo (predecessor of 1st Division (Japan)) in 1956, before his retirement as lieutenant general in 1964.Axis History Forum Later in life, Fujiwara authored the book F. Kikan: Japanese Army Intelligence Operations in Southeast Asia during World War II, in which he described himself as the ‚ÄúLawrence of Arabia of Southeast Asia‚Äù.

He was at the centre of a transfer dispute in 1948, when both Celtic and St Johnstone claimed to have signed him. The situation was eventually resolved in St Johnstone's favour and Buckley spent the next four seasons with the Perth side. He joined Aberdeen in a ¬£7,500 transfer in April 1952 and it is for his time with the Dons for which he is best known. He helped them to the League championship in 1954‚Äì55 and the 1955 League Cup success. He also played in two Scottish Cup finals, 1953 and 1954, both of which were lost. He retired due to a serious knee injury in 1957 but briefly returned to the game with Highland League side Inverness Caledonian the following year. Buckley was capped three times by Scotland, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 win over Norway in 1954. Initially selected in the squad for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, injury saw him replaced by club colleague George Hamilton. He scored his only Scotland goal against Wales in a 1‚Äì0 win upon his return to fitness in October later that year.

She served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and provided destroyer escort protection against submarine and air attack for Navy vessels and convoys. Post-war, she performed other tasks with the U.S. Coast Guard and with the U.S. Navy as a radar picket ship. She was named in honor of Marvin Lee Ramsden who was awarded the Silver Star for his brave actions during the Battle of the Coral Sea. She was laid down 26 March 1943 by the Brown Shipbuilding Corp., Houston, Texas; launched 24 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. James L. Ramsden, mother of Coxswain Ramsden; and commissioned 19 October 1943, Lt. Comdr. J. E. Madacey, USCG, in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations Following shakedown off Bermuda, Ramsden, manned by a Coast Guard crew and assigned to CortDiv 23, steamed to New York, whence she sailed, 19 December, with her first convoy, NY-47 to the Panama Canal Zone. Returning to New York 9 January 1944, she commenced transatlantic runs on the 11th with UGS-30 to Casablanca. Returning 23 February, she departed New York for Bizerte with UGS-36, 10 March. Steaming first to Norfolk, Virginia, where 62 more ships joined the 36 vessels from New York, the convoy headed across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean. Before dawn on 1 April, Nazi bombers and torpedo planes led in by flare-dropping scouts attacked the Allied ships.  Attacked by Luftwaffe Aircraft  In 15 minutes, 0405 to 0420, the Luftwaffe damaged one merchantman and lost five aircraft, one to Ramsden's guns. Two days later the convoy reached Tunisia and on the 11th got underway for New York, arriving 2 May. Availability and exercises at Casco Bay preceded another convoy run to Bizerte where men and supplies were being readied to push further into Axis-controlled Europe. Completing that run at Boston, Massachusetts, 11 July, Ramsden shifted to the North Atlantic convoy lanes and, during the remainder of the war in Europe, escorted seven convoys to the United Kingdom and France.  Transferred to the Pacific Fleet  With the collapse of Germany, Ramsden was transferred, with her division, to the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal 18 June 1945, she called at San Francisco, California, then continued on to Adak, arriving 8 July. On the 15th, she shifted to Attu, whence she operated on plane guard duty for the remainder of World War II.  End-of-War Activity  After Japan capitulated, the ship resumed escort duties, initially in the Aleutians, then, at the end of August, to Japan. On 9 September she brought auxiliary ships into Ominato Ko, Honsh≈´; and, on the 20th, headed back to the U.S. carrying returning veterans. Navy Day celebrations at Ketchikan interrupted her postwar duties, but in November she got underway, with replacement troops and equipment embarked for Okinawa. She arrived at Buckner Bay 25 November, joined the U.S. 7th Fleet, and on 11 December sailed for Tsingtao. Mail runs next took her to Manila and Shanghai whence she returned to Tsingtao 5 January 1946. She remained there supporting occupation troops until 11 February when she sailed for the eastern coast of the United States. Arriving at Charleston, South Carolina, 22 March, Ramsden steamed to Jacksonville, Florida, 24 April, then shifted to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she decommissioned 13 June 1946 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  On Loan to the U.S. Coast Guard  Ordered activated after the outbreak of war in Korea, Ramsden was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard and recommissioned 28 March 1952 with the Coast Guard hull designation WDE-382. Reporting for duty 1 April, Ramsden operated briefly on the west coast, then headed west to Honolulu, whence she operated on air-sea rescue patrol duty. On that duty for the next 2 years, she guarded the increased Pacific air traffic along routes between Hawaii and the mainland, Midway Island, Japan, and the Aleutians, and in the Aleutian and the Hawaiian Islands. Following the cessation of hostilities in Korea, and the subsequent decrease in air traffic, Ramsden returned to California, decommissioned at San Diego, California, on 10 April 1954 and reentered the Navy's Reserve Fleet 28 June 1954.  Converted to Radar Picket Ship Duty  Ordered activated and converted to an escort radar picket ship in 1956, the escort arrived at Long Beach, California, 19 October for conversion and on 1 November was redesignated DER-382. Recommissioned 10 December 1957, she underwent shakedown and training off the west coast and in March 1958 returned to the Hawaiian Islands, where she was once again homeported. Based at Pearl Harbor, she operated on barrier patrol duty stations from Midway Island to the Aleutians until the spring of 1960 when she returned to the west coast for inactivation.  Final Decommissioning  Decommissioning 23 June 1960, she again entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet and was struck from the Navy List on 1 August 1974. She was later used as a target and sunk; however, date of the sinking is not indicated in Navy records.  Awards  Ramsden earned one battle star during World War II.

At the time of his death, he was one of the oldest bishops in the Church. Biography Charles Buswell was born in Homestead, Oklahoma, to Charles and Bridget Buswell. However, the family moved to Oklahoma City shortly afterwards. He received his primary and secondary education at the cathedral‚Äôs St. Joseph School, studied for two years at St. Benedict‚Äôs College in Atchison, Kansas, and then entered St. Louis Preparatory Seminary in Webster Groves, Missouri, in 1933. After studying theology at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary in St. Louis, Buswell entered in 1936 the American College in Leuven, Belgium, where he was known as \\"both a serious student and a congenial companion among his fellow seminarians.\\" He also served as Prefect and assistant editor of The American College Bulletin during his studies. Buswell was eventually ordained to the priesthood on July 9, 1939. Upon his return to the United States, he was named assistant pastor of a Tonkawa parish and of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Cathedral in Oklahoma City. Buswell, after being made diocesan Vice-Chancellor, became the first pastor of Christ the King Parish in 1947. At Christ the King, he placed emphasis on the greater involvement of the laity. He was raised to the rank of a Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness in 1949, and later a Domestic Prelate of His Holiness in 1955. On August 8, 1959, Buswell was appointed the second Bishop of Pueblo, Colorado, by Pope John XXIII. He was consecrated on the following September 30 by Bishop Victor Reed, with Bishops Stephen Leven and Glennon Flavin serving as co- consecrators. Buswell attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, and later described the Council's mission as making the Church \\"a dynamic organism to penetrate the world with a spirit of truth and light\\" and not \\"a static remnant of past glory\\".National Catholic Reporter. Bishops too had to re-learn ‚Äòbeing church‚Äô October 4, 2002 The Bishop also spoke of opening the Church's windows \\"to let in fresh air and bring in a new vision that prepares the world for new responsibility for the world in which we live.\\" Following the introduction of the Mass in English, he criticized the wording of the Gloria.TIME Magazine. English Mass: Needs Work September 4, 1964 In 1973, the Vatican ordered that the practice of separating a child's first Communion from first confession, for psychological purposes, be stopped. Buswell responded by saying, \\"I am convinced that the reception of first Communion before first confession is based on good theology, is rooted in solid findings of the behavioral sciences, and is excellent pastoral practice\\".TIME Magazine. When to Confess September 3, 1973 He promised to continue the practice until the Vatican's decree received the \\"mature consideration\\" of American bishops and educators. During one of his Sunday visits in 1976 to the parishes of his diocese, he once introduced himself to a five-year-old girl at a Mass as \\"Charlie.\\" Following the end of the Mass, the little girl said, \\"Nice show, Charlie!\\".TIME Magazine.

The Unit was transferred to Bangkok at the end of that month and headed by Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, chief of intelligence of the 15th army. Its task was to contact the Indian independence movement, the overseas Chinese and the Malayan Sultans with the aim of encouraging friendship and cooperation with Japan. The unit was notable for its success in establishing cooperative ties between the Empire of Japan and the Indian independence movement, overseas Chinese and various Malay sultans. History and development Based on experiences in China, the Imperial Japanese Army established a semi-autonomous unit to carry out liaison duties with local independence movements in Southeast Asia and transmit intelligence gathered from these movements back to the army command. Two such units were established before the outbreak of World War II in South-East Asia: the Minami Kikan and the F Kikan. The F-Kikan was named after its leader, Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, chief of intelligence of the Japanese 15th Army, initially stationed in Bangkok in late 1941. Fujiwara's staff included five commissioned officers and two Hindi-speaking interpreters. Fujiwara's motto was that the intelligence activity for Imperial Japanese Army is \\"ultimate sincereness\\". After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 15th Army was tasked with the invasion of Malaya, during which time F-Kikan rescued Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim of Kedah and his family. His son (and future Malaysian Prime Minister) Tunku Abdul Rahman made a radio announcement urging the Malay people to cooperate with Japan. F-Kikan also attempted to mobilize the anti-British Kesatuan Melayu Muda, but since most of its leadership had been arrested by the British authorities shortly after the start of the war, its impact was minor. The F-Kikan was also instrumental in establishing relations with Indonesian resistance movements against Dutch colonial rule, especially in Aceh in northern Sumatra, which formed a backdrop to the Japanese occupation of Indonesia.Indonesian Volunteers in the Japanese Army. However, F-Kikan's greatest success was in its contacts with Indian independence leader Giani Pritam Singh Dhillon and Captain Mohan Singh, and recruitment of some 40,000 Indian prisoners of war into what eventually became the Indian National Army. This development was a tremendous coup for the Japanese government, and was a direct threat to the British position in India. After the British surrender of Singapore in 1942, F-Kikan was dissolved, and replaced by a new liaison agency, the Iwakuro Kikan, or \\"I-Kikan\\", to coordinate activities between the Indian National Army and the Japanese army.

Cell fusion occurs during differentiation of muscle, bone and trophoblast cells, during embryogenesis, and during morphogenesis. Cell fusion is a necessary event in the maturation of cells so that they maintain their specific functions throughout growth. History In 1847 Theodore Schwann expanded upon the theory that all living organisms are composed of cells when he added to it that discrete cells are the basis of life. Schwann observed that in certain cells the walls and cavities of the cells coalesce together. It was this observation that provided the first hint that cells fuse. It was not until 1960 that cell biologists deliberately fused cells for the first time. To fuse the cells, biologists combined isolated mouse cells, with the same kind of tissue, and induced fusion of their outer membrane using the Sendai virus (a respiratory virus in mice). Each of the fused hybrid cells contained a single nucleus with chromosomes from both fusion partners. Synkaryon became the name of this type of cell combined with a nucleus. In the late 1960s biologists successfully fused cells of different types and from different species. The hybrid products of these fusions, heterokaryon, were hybrids that maintained two or more separate nuclei. This work was headed by Henry Harris at the University of Oxford and Nils Ringertz from Sweden's Karolinska Institute. These two men are responsible for reviving the interest of cell fusion. The hybrid cells interested biologists in the area of how different kinds of cytoplasm affect different kinds of nuclei. The work conducted by Henry and Nils showed that proteins from one gene fusion affect gene expression in the other partner's nucleus, and vice versa. These hybrid cells that were created were considered forced exceptions to normal cellular integrity and it was not until 2002 that the possibility of cell fusion between cells of different types may have a real function in mammals. Two types a Cells of the same lineage fuse to form a cell with multiple nuclei, known as a syncytium. The fused cell can have an altered phenotype and new functions such as barrier formation. b Cells of different lineage fuse to form a cell with multiple nuclei, known as a heterokaryon. The fused cells might have undergone a reversion of phenotype or show transdifferentiation. c Cells of different lineage or the same lineage fuse to form a cell with a single nucleus, known as a synkaryon. New functions of the fused cell can include a reversion of phenotype, transdifferentiation and proliferation. If nuclear fusion occurs, the fused nucleus initially contains the complete chromosomal content of both fusion partners (4N), but ultimately chromosomes are lost and/or re-sorted (see arrows). If nuclear fusion does not occur, a heterokaryon (or syncytium) can become a synkaryon by shedding an entire nucleus. There are two different types of cell fusion that can occur. These two types include homotypic and heterotypic cell fusion. Homotypic cell fusion occurs between cells of the same type. An example of this would be osteoclasts or myofibers being fusing together with their respective type of cells. Whenever the two nuclei merge a synkaryon is produced. Cell fusion normally occurs with nuclear fusion, but in the absence of nuclear fusion, the cell would be described as a binucleated heterokaryon. A heterokaryon is the melding of two or more cells into one and it may reproduce itself for several generations. If two of the same type of cells fuse, but their nuclei do not fuse, then the resulting cell is called a syncytium. Heterotypic cell fusion occurs between cells of different types, making it the exact opposite of homotypic cell fusion. The result of this fusion is also a synkaryon produced by the merging of the nuclei, and a binucleated heterokaryon in the absence of nuclear fusion. An example of this would be Bone Marrow Derived Cells (BMDCs) being fused with parenchymatous organs. Four methods There are four methods that cell biologists and biophysicists use to fuse cells. These four ways include electrical cell fusion, polyethylene glycol cell fusion, and sendai virus induced cell fusion and a newly developed method termed optically controlled thermoplasmonics. BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator cell fusion applications manufactured by BTX Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA USA Electrical cell fusion is an essential step in some of the most innovative methods in modern biology. This method begins when two cells are brought into contact by dielectrophoresis. Dielectrophoresis uses a high frequency alternating current, unlike electrophoresis in which a direct current is applied. Once the cells are brought together, a pulsed voltage is applied. The pulse voltage causes the cell membrane to permeate and subsequent combining of the membranes and the cells then fuse. After this, alternative voltage is applied for a brief period of time to stabilize the process. The result of this is that the cytoplasm has mixed together and the cell membrane has completely fused. All that remains separate is the nuclei, which will fuse at a later time within the cell, making the result a heterokaryon cell. Polyethylene glycol cell fusion is the simplest, but most toxic, way to fuse cells. In this type of cell fusion polyethylene glycol, PEG, acts as a dehydrating agent and fuses not only plasma membranes but also intracellular membranes. This leads to cell fusion since PEG induces cell agglutination and cell-to-cell contact. Though this type of cell fusion is the most widely used, it still has downfalls. Oftentimes PEG can cause uncontrollable fusion of multiple cells, leading to the appearance of giant polykaryons. Also, standard PEG cell fusion is poorly reproducible and different types of cells have various fusion susceptibilities. This type of cell fusion is widely used for the production of somatic cell hybrids and for nuclear transfer in mammalian cloning. Sendai virus induced cell fusion occurs in four different temperature stages. During the first stage, which lasts no longer than 10 minutes, viral adsorption takes place and the adsorbed virus can be inhibited by viral antibodies. The second stage, which is 20 minutes, is pH dependent and an addition of viral antiserum can still inhibit ultimate fusion. In the third, antibody-refractory stage, viral envelope constituents remain detectable on the surface of cells. During the fourth stage, cell fusion becomes evident and HA neuraminidase and fusion factor begin to disappear. The first and second stages are the only two that are pH dependent. Thermoplasmonics induced cell fusion Thermoplasmonics is based on a near infrared (NIR) laser and a plasmonic nanoparticle. The laser which typically acts as an optical trap, is used to heat the nanoscopic plasmonic particle to very high and extremely locally elevated temperatures. Optical trapping of such a nanoheater at the interface between two membrane vesicles, or two cells, leads to immediate fusion of the two verified by both content and lipid mixing. Advantages include full flexibility of which cells to fuse and fusion can be performed in any buffer condition unlike electroformation which is affected by salt. In human therapy Alternative forms of restoring organ function and replacing damaged cells are needed with donor organs and tissue for transplantation being so scarce. It is because of the scarcity that biologists have begun considering the potential for therapeutic cell fusion. Biologists have been discussing implications of the observation that cell fusion can occur with restorative effects following tissue damage or cell transplantation. Though using cell fusion for this is being talked about and worked on, there are still many challenges those who wish to implement cell fusion as a therapeutic tool face. These challenges include choosing the best cells to use for the reparative fusion, determining the best way to introduce the chosen cells into the desired tissue, discovering methods to increase the incidence in cell fusion, and ensuring that the resulting fusion products will function properly. If these challenges can be overcome then cell fusion may have therapeutic potential. Microorganisms =Fungi= Plasmogamy is the stage of the sexual cycle of fungi in which two cells fuse together to share a common cytoplasm while bringing haploid nuclei from both partners together in the same cell. =Amoebozoa= Cell fusion (plasmogamy or syngamy) is a stage in the Amoebozoa sexual cycle. =Bacteria= In Escherichia coli spontaneous zygogenesis (Z-mating) involves cell fusion, and appears to be a form of true sexuality in prokaryotes. Bacteria that perform Z-mating are called Szp+.

John Henry Dearle (22 August 1859 - 15 January 1932) was a British textile and stained-glass designer trained by the artist and craftsman William Morris who was much influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Dearle designed many of the later wallpapers and textiles released by Morris & Co., and contributed background and foliage patterns to tapestry designs featuring figures by Edward Burne-Jones and others. Beginning in his teens as a shop assistant and then design apprentice, Dearle rose to become Morris & Co.'s chief designer by 1890, creating designs for tapestries, embroidery, wallpapers, woven and printed textiles, stained glass, and carpets. Following Morris's death in 1896, Dearle was appointed Art Director of the firm, and became its principal stained glass designer on the death of Burne-Jones in 1898. Morris's reputation overshadowed Dearle's work throughout Dearle's career: Dearle exhibited early patterns under Morris's name and Dearle designs continue to be sold as Morris patterns. Critical assessment of Dearle's work then underwent a significant change, during the final decades of the twentieth century, recognizing Dearle's mature work as having a unique artistic vision of its own. Dearle always remained close to Morris's esthetic, but from the 1890s onward he incorporated a distinctive set of Persian and Turkish influences.

Morris had finished his first solo effort at tapestry in September 1879,Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, New York, Viking Press, p. 103-04 and shortly thereafter Morris and Dearle set up a tapestry loom at Queen Square. Dearle executed Morris & Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by Walter Crane in 1883. Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the workshop and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or cartoons by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons) and animal figures by Philip Webb. In the late 1880s, Dearle began designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles, and it is likely that his designs for large-scale embroideries also date from around this time.Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, p. 30-31 From 1890, Dearle was head designer for the firm, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at Merton AbbeyParry, Linda, ed.: William Morris, Abrams, 1996, p.54 He was appointed Art Director of Morris & Co. following Morris's death in 1896. Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his death in 1932. Designs Fabric and wallpaper designs attributed to Henry Dearle include Cherwell (registered 1887), Trent (1888), Persian Brocatel (c. 1890), Daffodil (c. 1891), Compton (1896), Tulip (1895-1900), Artichoke (1897), and Persian or New Persian (1905).Parry, Linda: William Morris Textiles, p. 150-72 Dearle also designed embroidery panels for screens and portieres in the Art Needlework style under the tutelage of May Morris, including Anemone (1895-90), and the well-known Owl and Pigeon (or Partridge) (c. 1895).

However, Dearle originally exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own, especially in the Arts and Crafts Exhibitions and the major Morris retrospective of 1899,Parry, Linda: William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook, New York, Portland House, 1989, p. 9-10 and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as \\"William Morris\\" patterns. As late as 1981, the catalog of an exhibit of Morris & Co. textiles dismissed Dearle's style as \\"rarely more than a pastiche of his master's\\",Fairclough, Oliver and Emmeline Leary, Textiles by William Morris and Morris & Co. 1861-1940, Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, 1981, p. 15 citing as a source Lewis F.

To be spiritually uplifted (36.3 per cent). 3. To gain insights into practical Christianity (35.2 percent).\\" While the editor did note some disagreement, he stated: :\\"Three points are worth noting: First, the overwhelming majority of all readers say that the RECORD should keep the readers informed, the RECORD should encourage discussion of issues facing the church, and readers should have the right to speak candidly in the letters section. Second, RECORD is seen to support the church's doctrines, lifestyle emphasis, ministry, administration etc. Third, the overwhelming majority feel that, granted the spectrum of readers the RECORD seeks to reach, it has a good balance in its editorial mix.\\"Reported in James Coffin, \\"Readers Call for Openness\\".

It was designed by Louis H. Sullivan for the Illinois Central Railroad and opened on June 1, 1892. It was located on South Rampart Street, in front of the current New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal. The station was used primarily by the Illinois Central Railroad as the terminus for its main line from Chicago, including the celebrated Panama Limited. However, it also served a number of other lines, including the Southern Pacific Railroad and its Sunset Limited. The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, an IC subsidiary, used the station for trains from Mississippi. Missouri Pacific (Gulf Coast Line) trains from Houston used this station although other Missouri Pacific trains used the T&P; Station. Before the Huey P. Long Bridge was constructed, the Sunset and other Southern Pacific trains reached the station by ferry from Avondale. By the 1940s, a total of 13 passenger trains arrived and departed from the station daily. New Orleans Union Station was the only train station architect Louis Sullivan designed. It was constructed in the architect's well-known 'Chicago School' style and decorated with his iconic ornament. Adler and Sullivan's head draftsman Frank Lloyd Wright was involved in the final work under Sullivan's supervision. Union Station was a three story hip-roofed structure with a cupola, including office and waiting areas, with a broad portico with central columns and arched entryways at each end of the entrance. New Orleans at the time of the station's construction had several other railway stations including the Texas Pacific - Missouri Pacific Railway Station on Annunciation St. between Melpomene and Thalia Streets; The Louisiana and Arkansas Railway - Kansas City Southern Railroad Station at 705 S. Rampart Street; the Southern Railway Terminal at 1125 Canal Street and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Station, on Canal St. near the Mississippi River. The station was demolished in 1954 and replaced by the current New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal that consolidated the inter-city railroad services.

The film is a look at life in the U.S. from the perspective of frustrated Cuban exiles. Plot summary Roberto and Aurelia are ten-year exiles from Castro's Cuba, now residing in New York City with their 17-year-old daughter Aurelita. Roberto has become the super of the building in which he lives, with the troubles of his tenants and his overall discontentment with his current living situation driving the plot of the film. He and his wife have trouble understanding their daughter, who smokes pot and likes to disco dance; this is further compounded by the problems she gets into during the latter half of the film, including a pregnancy scare with potentially multiple men. Roberto spends the majority of the film conversing with other exiles, such as Pancho, a fellow Cuban, and Cuco, an exile from Puerto Rico; he also tries to find a way to move to Miami to escape from New York, as he feels that, despite the escape from Cuba, that this was a waste of his past ten years and seeks to live out the remainder of his life in peace. After Roberto makes his wish come true by finding a factory job in the area, he celebrates both his wife's birthday and the family's moving out with a grand party; the ending of the film has Roberto desperately laugh in the dim basement, playing further into the isolation he's felt in the past decade.

It is a sequel to Life and Adventures of Four Friends 1/2 (film), set in Russia. Adapted from the story of the same name by Yusef Printsev and directed by Oleg Yeryshev. This is a second film in the popular family series about the adventures of three dogs and one cat, who are following their owner and are having much fun together. Film runs 60 minutes, and has two parts: 3. Igra s ognyom (aka.. Playing games with fire), and 4. Kot v meshke (aka.. Cat in the bag). Plot Dogs and cat are together again. Three dogs and one cat are now good friends and they continue their adventures while they are following their owner, a forest ranger (played by Petr Shelokhonov). This time the cat becomes the leader of the four friends. Cat Svetofor together with three dogs: Bubrik, Fram, and Toshka are going on a winter journey, they follow their owner on an airplane flying North. The four animals travel to a nursery where New Year trees are grown. There four animals help people to stop the fire and save New Year trees. Then, together with their owner, the four friends join children for celebration of the New Year.  Production  * Filming dates 1980 - 1981 * Filming locations: Lentelefilm studios, Leningrad, Leningrad Oblast, Russia. * Five additional animal tamers took part in filming. * Three dogs and one cat were selected for filming after auditioning hundreds of dogs and cats with their owners. * Dogs and cat \\"improvised\\" a lot before the camera, so many takes were made for each scene before getting good results for congruent editing. * Dogs and cat made some unexpected moves during the filming, so the writer, Yusef Printsev, had to create additional lines for human actors and for translator of the animals' thoughts (Lev Lemke). Release * The film was released in 1981, on the Moscow Central Television, as well as in theatres in Leningrad, Moscow, and across Russia, as a sequel to Zhizn i priklyucheniya chetyrekh druzei 1/2. Both films also ran in theatres across the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe. In 1994 the film was re-edited in St. Petersburg, Russia for video release. That same year the film was released on VHS and DVD, having several editions during the 1990s, and has been a popular family entertainment for all ages. * The film and its prequel were also released in Germany in the 2000s (decade) under the title \\"Die Abenteuer der vier Strolche (1/2)\\" and the sequel \\"Die Abenteuer der vier Strolche (3/4).\\" * This film is the second in a series of 8 episodes made between 1980 and 1994. Each episode has a different plot and variations in the cast of actors and crew, but with the same three dogs remaining in the first 4 episodes. The first 4 episodes are paired (1/2 and 3/4) and edited as two movies for video release, now available on VHS and DVD in Europe and in the countries of the former USSR. It remains a popular family movie for all ages.  Interesting facts  * This is a second film in the popular Russian children's series about three dogs and a cat becoming friends. In real life, three dogs, named Toshka, Bubrik and Fram, and a cat Svetofor became really friendly and cooperative with actors and director in the course of filming. Owners of dogs and cat also became extras in the film. * Cat Vaska was too independent, and eventually walked away from the project.

Its idea is similar to RobotWar. The concept of the game was invented by Toby Smith in a BASIC program \\"when people with 512K of RAM and two floppy drives were power-users\\", as he states in the game manual. The game consists of a battleground and two robots. Before the game starts, each robot is preprogrammed using a BASIC-like language called RIPPLE (\\"Robot Instructional Programming Language\\"). 0-99 humans can also be placed into the battleground to throw the robots with hand grenades. The programs are checked for syntax and the game starts. The robot to survive the longer is the winner. The RIPPLE language programs consist of logic commands, such as flow of control statements; and action commands, that actually make the robot perform an action, such as fire a weapon. To perform one action command takes the same time as to perform 99 logic commands.

Jargon is one of the oldest and most prestigious small presses in the United States and has published seminal works of the American literary avant-garde, including books by Charles Olson, Louis Zukofsky, Paul Metcalf, James Broughton, and Williams himself, as well as sui generis books of folk art such as White Trash Cooking. Though most of Jargon's writers are either cult figures or genuine obscurities, the books themselves are often intricately designed deluxe editions. Guy Davenport described the Jargon Society as \\"a paradoxical fusion of fine printing and samizdat diffusion.\\"  History  The Jargon Society was founded in 1951 by Jonathan Williams and David Ruff in a San Francisco Chinese restaurant. Jargon 1 was the first work to be published by the small press, consisting of Williams' poem \\"Garbage Litters the Iron face of the Sun‚Äôs Child\\" and an etching by Ruff, made into a folded pamphlet. Only 150 copies were produced. Jargon 2, published in the same year, was called \\"The Dancer,\\" and contained a poem by Joel Oppenheimer and a drawing by Robert Rauschenberg. Williams continued publishing works from fellow students and teachers while attending Black Mountain College in Black Mountain, North Carolina. Williams enjoyed publishing writers and artists that were considered \\"underdogs,\\" often encouraging collaboration between them. His predilection to champion outsiders in art and literature earned Williams the epithet \\"custodian of snowflakes\\" from literary critic Hugh Kenner. The press has published many influential works of the literary avant-garde, including The Maximus Poems by Charles Olson and The Neugents by David M. Spear. Jargon passed down the opportunity to publish the now Beat Generation classic, Howl, by Allen Ginsberg. One of the most well-known titles published by Jargon was White Trash Cooking by Ernest Matthew Mickler. This cookbook, which has been rejected by publishers in the Northeast before its publication by Jargon, was such a success that the small press could not keep up with orders. After a month, unable to keep up with demand, Jargon sold the rights to Ten Speed Press for $90,000 and a 15% royalties clause. Jargon has also sponsored many programs in literature and the arts, providing support for poets, photographers, and others \\"who are deserving but not recognized.\\" The Jargon Society's inventory and rights were given to the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center soon after Williams' passing in 2008. The museum has continued publication under the imprint. As of 2019, there are 115 Jargon titles, including 85 books and 30 broadsides, pamphlets, and other types of work. The most recent publication is The Black Mountain College Anthology of Poetry, produced in collaboration with the University of North Carolina Press.  Notable titles  Many poets' first and sometimes their most major works were Jargon titles. A few of the most notable titles published by this independent press are: * Hurrah for Anything: Poems and Drawings, Kenneth Patchen (1957). * Jargon 31: 14 Poets, 1 Artist (1958) - Poems by Paul Blackburn, Bob Brown, Edward Dahlberg, Max Finstein, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Goodman, Denise Levertov, Walter Lowenfels, Edward Marshall, EA Navaretta, Joel Oppenheimer, Gilbert Sorrentino, Jonathan Williams, Louis Zukofsky, each with a drawing by Fielding Dawson. * Plum Poems, Ross Feld (1971). * The Appalachian photographs of Doris Ulmann, Doris Ulmann (1971). * Epitaphs for Lorine, Jonathan Williams (1973). * Elite/Elate Poems: Selected Poems 1971-75, Jonathan Williams (1979). * Sappho‚Äôs Raft (le rideau de la Mytil√©nienne), Thomas Meyer (1982); not to be confused with Sappho by Meyer, published by Coracle Press. * White Trash Cooking, Ernest Matthew Mickler (1986). * Bill Anthony‚Äôs Greatest Hits., William Anthony (1988).

It is an anadromous fish species, meaning that it spawns in freshwater portions of rivers, but spends most of its life at sea. It is subject to fishing, both historic and current, but it is often confused with or simply grouped together with catch statistics for American shad (A. sapidissima). Distribution, habitat, and life history thumb Hickory shad range from northern Florida to the Gulf of Maine. The largest populations occur in Chesapeake Bay and coastal North Carolina.Munroe, T.A.

It is a schooling anadromous species that inhabits marine waters, probably never far from land. Adults enter estuaries and freshwater tributaries from the St. John's River, Florida, to the Patuxent River, Maryland, to spawn during the spring. Their oceanic movements are poorly documented.

It is an Anglicized form of the Irish √ì hOiss√≠n. In Irish, it is pronounced \\"O + hush + een\\". It appears to originate in Co. Galway and in County Mayo. The Hession surname is predominantly found in these counties in the Census of Ireland, 1911. It denotes descent from a person named Ois√≠n, a personal name meaning \\"little deer\\", and the name of the poet and warrior of the fianna in Irish mythology. √Åed Ua hOiss√≠n was the name of two Irish clerics in the 11th and 12th centuries - the coarb of St. Jarlath (1050) and the first Archbishop of Tuam (1152) respectively. George Petrie who unearthed the High cross at Tuam which bears an inscription √Åed Ua hOiss√≠n wrote that he was assisted by a gentleman of the name O'Heshin who little realised he was digging up the relic of an ancestor. Darby O'Hession (spelt O'Hoysshynne) is the name of a Galway Cleric in the 16th, a vicar choral recorded in that churches first charter of St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church in Galway in 1551. Hardiman History of Galway 1820 Hession has occasionally been spelt Hessian in Galway and is sometimes falsely assumed to be of German origin - See Hessian. MacLysaght suggests a connection with the surname Ussher - which is probably the name of a separate and distinct family of English Origin based in Dublin and later in Galway. This connection with Ussher is apparently the basis for claims the family is of Norman or English Origin, and the use of the Ussher Arms for the family on popular family history sites. The name may be related with similar names Hishon in County Limerick and Hassan in County Londonderry. Hishon is the anglicised form of √ì hOise√°in and finds an early reference amongst the Allies of the MacNamara family in Co Clare in the early 14th century. While Hassan is the anglicized form of √ì hOs√°in.

Many tribes used Arkansas as their hunting lands but the main tribe was the Quapaw, who settled in the Arkansas delta upon moving south from Illinois. Early French explorers gave the territory its name, a corruption of Akansea, which is a phonetic spelling of the Illinois word for the Quapaw. This phonetic heritage explains why \\"Arkansas\\" is pronounced so differently than \\"Kansas\\" even though they share the same spelling. What began as a rough wilderness inhabited by trappers and hunters became incorporated into the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and became the Territory of Arkansaw in 1819. Upon gaining statehood in 1836, Arkansas had begun to prosper under a plantation economy that was heavily reliant on slave labor. After the American Civil War, Arkansas was a poor rural state based on cotton. Prosperity returned in the 1940s and it became famous for its political leadership, including President Bill Clinton (Governor, 1979‚Äì81 and 1983‚Äì92), and as the base for the Walmart Corporation. Early Arkansas =Paleo and Archaic periods= Beginning around 11,700 B.C.E., the first indigenous people inhabited the area now known as Arkansas after crossing today's Bering Strait, formerly Beringia. The first people in modern-day Arkansas likely hunted woolly mammoths by running them off cliffs or using Clovis points, and began to fish as major rivers began to thaw towards the end of the last great ice age.Arnold 2002, p. 5. Forests also began to grow around 9500 BCE, allowing for more gathering by native peoples. Crude containers became a necessity for storing gathered items. Since mammoths had become extinct, hunting bison and deer became more common. These early peoples of Arkansas likely lived in base camps and departed on hunting trips for months at a time.Arnold 2002, p. 7. =Woodland and Mississippi periods= Toltec Mounds Site near Scott Further warming led to the beginnings of agriculture in Arkansas around 650 BCE. Fields consisted of clearings, and Native Americans would begin to form villages around the plot of trees they had cleared. Shelters became more permanent and pottery became more complex.Arnold, et al 2002, p. 9. Burial mounds, surviving today in places such as Parkin Archeological State Park and Toltec Mounds Archaeological State Park, became common in northeast Arkansas. This reliance on agriculture marks an entrance into Mississippian culture around 950 CE. Wars began occurring between chieftains over land disputes. Platform mounds gain popularity in some cultures. The Native American nations that lived in Arkansas prior to the westward movement of peoples from the East were the Quapaw, Caddo, and Osage Nations. While moving westward, the Five Civilized Tribes inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period. European colonization =The expeditions of De Soto, Marquette and Joliet= A drawing of the burial of De Soto The first European contact with Arkansas was the Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto in 1541. De Soto wandered among settlements, inquiring about gold and other valuable natural resources. He encountered the Casqui in northeast Arkansas, who sent him north around Devil's Elbow to the Pacaha, the traditional enemies of the Casqui. Upon arrival in the Pacaha village, the Casqui who had followed behind de Soto attacked and raided the village. De Soto ultimately engaged the two tribes' chiefs in a peace treaty before continuing on across central Arkansas and into the Ozark Mountains in his search for riches. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way; he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all of the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting an attack with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, Quigualtam. His men obeyed and did not stop with killing the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day McArthur in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed: \\"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs.\\" which were auctioned off to his men. His starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from Native Americans and who had not been allowed to eat the enormous herd of hogs but had had to care for them, immediately started to butcher them. Later on his remaining men, now commanded by his aide de camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water. In 1673, French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet reached the Arkansas River on an expedition to map the Mississippi River. After a calumet with friendly Quapaw, the group suspected the Spanish to be nearby and returned north. =French Louisiana= Louisiana, 1687 Robert La Salle entered Arkansas in 1681 as part of his quest to find the mouth of the Mississippi River, and thus claim the entire river for New France.Fletcher 1989, p. 26. La Salle and his partner, Henri de Tonti, succeeded in this venture, claiming the river in April 1682. La Salle would return to France while dispatching de Tonti to wait for him and hold Fort St. Louis. On the king's orders, La Salle returned to colonize the Gulf of Mexico for the French, but ran aground in Matagorda Bay.Mattison 1957, pp. 118‚Äì119. La Salle led three expeditions on foot searching for the Mississippi River, but his third party mutinied near Navasota, Texas in 1687. de Tonti learned of La Salle's Texas expeditions and traveled south in an effort to locate him along the Mississippi River. Along with this journey south, de Tonti founded Arkansas Post as a waypoint for his searches in 1686.Mattison 1957, p. 119. La Salle's party, now led by his brother, stumbled upon the Post and were greeted kindly by Quapaw with fond memories of La Salle. The troupe thought it best to lie and say La Salle remained at his new coastal colony.Arnold et al 2002, p. 31. The French colonization of the Mississippi Valley would end with the later destruction of Fort St. Louis were it not for de Tonti establishing the small trading stop, Arkansas Post.Mattison 1957, p. 120. The party originally led by La Salle would depart the Post and continue north to Montreal, where interest was spurred in explorers who had the knowledge that the French had a holding in the region.Arnold et al 2002, p. 32 =The first settlement: Arkansas Post= Annie Hatley, Depiction of Arkansas Post in 1689, Arkansas State Archives, 1904 The first successful European settlement, \\"Poste de Arkansea,\\" was established by Henri de Tonti in 1686 on the Arkansas River.Arnold 1992, p. 75. The post disbanded for unknown reasons in 1699 but was reestablished in 1721 in the same location. Sited slightly upriver from the confluence of the Arkansas River and Mississippi River, the remote post was a center of trade and home base for fur trappers in the region to trade their wares. The French settlers mingled and in some cases even intermarried with Quapaw natives, sharing a dislike of English and Chickasaw, who were allies at the time. A moratorium on furs imposed by Canada severely affected the post's economy, and many settlers began to move out of the Mississippi River Valley. Scottish banker John Law saw the struggling post and attempted to entice settlers to emigrate from Germany to start an agriculture settlement at Arkansas Post, but his efforts failed when Law-created Mississippi Bubble burst in 1720. The French maintained the post throughout this time mostly due to its strategic significance along the Mississippi River. The post was moved back further from the Mississippi River in 1749 after the English with their Chickasaw allies attacked, it was moved downriver in 1756 to be closer to a Qua-paw defensive line that had been established, and to serve, as an repent, or trading post, during the Seven Years' War and prevent attacks from the Spanish along the Mississippi.Arnold 1992, p. 79. After the war ended, the post was again moved upriver out of the floodplain in 1779.Arnold 1983, p. 324. Colbert's raid on Arkansas Post in 1783 The Treaty of Fontainebleau gave Spain the Louisiana Territory in exchange for Florida (although credit is often given to the public Treaty of Paris), including present-day Arkansas. The Spanish show little interest in Arkansas Post except for the land grants meant to inspire settlement around the post which would later cause problems with land titles given by the American government.Arnold ET AL 2002, p. 82. The post's position up the Arkansas River made it a hub for trappers to start their journeys, although it also served as a diplomatic center for relations between the Spanish and Qua-paw.Arnold 1983, pp. 319‚Äì320. Many that stopped at Arkansas Post were simply passing through on their way up or down river and needed supplies or rest.Arnold 1983, p. 320 Inhabitants of the post included approximately 10 elite merchants, some domestic slaves, and the wives and children of trappers who were out in the wilderness.Arnold 1992, p. 77. Only the elites actually lived inside the defensive walls of the post, with the remaining people surrounding the fortification. In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the American Revolutionary War, a brief raid of the post by British Captain James Colbert, with the assistance of Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. Road to statehood The United States, with the Louisiana Purchase overlaid Although the United States of America had gained separation from the British as a result of the Revolutionary War, Arkansas remained in Spanish hands after the conflict. Americans began moving west to Kentucky and Tennessee, and the United States wanted to guarantee these people that the Spanish possession of the Mississippi River would not disrupt commerce. Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of Spain shortly after the American Revolution forced the Spanish to cede Louisiana, including Arkansas, to the French via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800. England declared war on France in 1803, and Napoleon sold his land in the new world to the United States, today known as the Louisiana Purchase. The size of the country doubled with the purchase, and a stream of new White settlers led to a changed dynamic between Native Americans and Arkansans.Arnold et al 2002, p. 78. Prior to the Louisiana Purchase, the relationship between the two groups was a \\"middle ground\\" of give and take. These relationships would deteriorate all across the frontier, including in Arkansas.Arnold et al 2002, p. 79. Thomas Jefferson initiated the Lewis and Clark Expedition to find the nation's new northern boundary, and the Dunbar Hunter Expedition, led by William Dunbar, was sent to establish the new southern boundary. The group was intended to explore the Red River, but due to Spanish hostility settled on a tour up the Ouachita River to explore the hot springs in central Arkansas. Leaving in October 1804 and parting company at Fort Miro on January 16, 1805, their reports included detailed accounts of give and take between Native Americans and trappers, detailed flora and fauna descriptions, and a chemical analysis of the \\"healing waters\\" of the hot springs.Arnold et al 2002, p. 85. Useful information for settlers to navigate the area and descriptions of the people inhabiting south Arkansas was also included. The settler-Native American relationship deteriorated further following the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, viewed by some as punishment for accepting and assimilating into White culture. Many Cherokee left their farms and moved shortly after a speech admonishing the tribe for departing from tradition following a speech in June 1812 by a tribal chief.Arnold et al 2002, p. 89. =Political integration and autonomy= Missouri before statehood, 1819 A small segment of the Territory of Missouri applied for statehood on March 2, 1819. The application included a provision that would bring Missouri into the Union as a slave state, which would upset the delicate balance of slave and free states. This application also defined all land in the Missouri Territory south of the parallel 36¬∞30' north, except the Missouri Bootheel between the Mississippi River and the Saint Francis River north of the 36th parallel north, as the new Territory of Arkansaw. When the Missouri Enabling Act was taken up in the United States House of Representatives, James Tallmadge denounced slavery and succeeded in passing the Tallmadge Amendment in the House, an act that would have extinguished slavery in Missouri in a generation. The act was the first attempt to curb the rapid expansion of slavery along the country's expanding western frontier and caught many southern Democrats by surprise.Johnson 1965, p. 48 The following day, John Taylor proposed identical restrictions on slavery before authorizing the Arkansaw Enabling Act.Johnson 1965, pp. 49‚Äì52. The banning of new slaves amendment was soundly defeated, but the gradual emancipation measure was tied until Speaker of the House Henry Clay cast the deciding no vote killing the Amendment and allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.Johnson 1965, p. 58. The Missouri Compromise was later struck allowing Maine to enter as a free state, thus allowing Missouri to enter as a slave state to keeping the balance of free/slave states at 12 each. The uncertainty surrounding Missouri's status as a slave state caused a rapid out-migration of slaveholders into Arkansas. Slavery also became a divisive issue within Arkansas. The wealthy planters of southeast Arkansas strongly supported slavery since manual labor was the only method of harvesting cotton at the time.Bolton 1999, p. 9. The northwest parts of the state did not have cotton plantations, and as little as 2% of the black population in northwest Arkansas was enslaved during the territorial era. However, northwest Arkansas backed slavery in support of the southeastern Arkansas planters.Scroggs 1961, pp. 231‚Äì232. Different aspects of frontier life are preserved today in three state parks. Historic Washington State Park in southwest Arkansas is a restored town that was formerly a bustling stop on the Southwest Trail. Davidsonville Historic State Park preserves one of early Arkansas's most important communities, including Arkansas's first post office and courthouse. Powhatan Historic State Park on the Black River allows visitors to relive a former riverport town during its heyday. =U.S. territory= The new Arkansas Territory held its territorial government at the territorial capital, Arkansas Post, and included all of present-day Arkansas and Oklahoma except the Oklahoma panhandle.Ledbetter 1988, p. 103. These lands became Indian Territory by 1828, leaving the modern day outline of Arkansas. Upon creation of the territory, President James Monroe appointed James Miller of New Hampshire, the hero of Lundy's Lane, as territorial governor, and young Robert Crittenden as secretary of the territory.Ledbetter 1988, p. 102. Miller had little interest in governing the territory, and spent most of his time without its boundaries.Ledbetter 1988, p. 105.Ledbetter 1988, p. 107. This left an opportunist Crittenden in charge of Arkansas, and he quickly assembled three judges together to form Arkansas's first legislature. Crittenden also held an election that selected James Woodson Bates as Arkansas's territorial delegate to Congress in addition to forming and filling two branches of territorial legislature. This election became contested when Miller returned and decided Arkansas would follow an 1812 law that all territorial legislative positions were to be filled by appointment, nullifying Crittenden's election. Congress later affirmed the election, but the situation formed a divide between Miller's followers and the Crittenden faction.Ledbetter 1988, p. 104. Arkansaw Territory, 1820 Miller and Crittenden were again divided over the relocation of the territorial capitol from the unsuitable backwater at Arkansas Post. The legislature discussed the issue of relocating the capitol in 1820, but could not decide between Little Rock and Cadron before the session ended. After the session ended, William Russell, owner of hundreds of lots around Little Rock, began selling them to legislators and influential men like Crittenden, Robert Oden, William A. Trimble, and Andrew Scott.Arnold et al 2002, p. 96. Upon returning, the legislature passed a bill to move the capitol to Little Rock by three votes, increasing the value of many legislators' Little Rock lots significantly. In protest, Miller moved to a new house at Crystal Hill near Cadron before being reassigned to Salem, Massachusetts. During the move to Little Rock, Crittenden formed the Rose Law Firm with Chester Ashley, forming a powerful political alliance between The Family and Crittenden's supporters.Arnold et al 2002, p. 97. Arkansas's second territorial governor was George Izard, a wealthy planter who moved to the territory from South Carolina.Eno 1945, p. 278. Izard succeeded in changing divorce law and briefly stopping the Quapaw removal in Arkansas. He also organized a militia and managed to quiet Crittenden, who remained as secretary of the territory.Eno 1945, p. 280. Izard died in 1828 and was replaced by John Pope, who was appointed by Andrew Jackson.Eno 1945, p. 281. =Indian removal= The Indian Removal Act resulted in the transplantation of several Native American tribes and the Trail of Tears. In an effort to prevent white settlers taking over their territory, the Quapaw signed an 1818 treaty relinquishing all their hunting lands in exchange for keeping of land along the Arkansas River in south Arkansas in their possession. This treaty was later reneged upon the following year, with whites taking all but back for settlement. At this time, Cherokee from Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina were being forced into Arkansas onto Caddo hunting lands west of Little Rock.Fletcher 1989, p. 43. The Caddo did not welcome the invasion of the Cherokee, who had thought they were moving to uninhabited land. The Caddo viewed the Cherokee as \\"domesticated\\" by the white man for signing treaties with the United States government and the tribes went to war. Cephas Washburn established Dwight Mission near Russellville as a school for Cherokee youth at the tribe's request in 1822. This school was later moved to Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The Osage signed a treaty to leave Arkansas in 1825 and moved to Kansas briefly before buying their own reservation in Osage County, Oklahoma. The United States established Fort Smith and Fort Gibson, Oklahoma to keep the peace and trade with the Native Americans. During the Industrial Revolution, cotton prices boomed and white settlers clamored for the fertile lands around the Arkansas River inhabited by the Quapaw. Eventually the government forced the Quapaw to a reservation in Louisiana with the Caddo.Lyon 1950, p. 208. Antoine Baroque led the Quapaw south in the winter of 1825‚Äì26. They found the Caddo inhospitable because the Quapaw were viewed as invaders and when the Quapaw's crop washed away twice due to flooding of the Red River, conditions got even worse.White 1962, p. 199. Combined with the overcrowding and lack of annuities promised to both tribes, the Quapaw were unhappy and followed chief Saracen back to their homeland along the Arkansas River.Lyon 1950, pp. 208‚Äì209. By 1830, the entire tribe had returned to Arkansas, and despite Governor Pope and Indian agent Richard Hannon, the Quapaw were removed to a separate reservation in northeast Oklahoma in 1833.White 1962, p. 197. Secretary Robert Crittenden was instrumental in acquiring the final removal.White 1962, p. 194. =Increasing demand for slave labor= Lakeport Plantation, built ca. 1859 Many slaves were brought to Arkansas by planters looking to cash in on the Arkansas delta's fertile lands. The most capable male slaves were often separated from their families and relocated to the swamps of southeast Arkansas. These swamplands were poorly drained, and many planters required their slaves to work long hours clearing trees from the swamps by hand. Slaves were forced to live in cramped slave quarters in the densely forested swamps, surrounded by disease-carrying mosquitoes. Conditions were brutal; slaves often received only one pair of clothes per year, given on Christmas by the planter family. Diets consisted of only fatback and cornmeal, usually lacking in vegetables and other necessities to stave off deficiencies.Bolton 1999, p. 10. Life as a slave was unbearable.Gatewood and Whayne 1993, p. 15. Though quite dangerous, some slaves would leave their plantations late at night to meet with slaves on other plantations to worship and comfort each other. These meetings were clandestine. Very few planters gave permission to their slaves to have these meetings.Moneyhon 1999, p. 34. Often slaves were threatened if they didn't work fast enough. They had to work in horrible conditions, with broken tools, even when they didn't understand instructions at the threat of violence. Sometimes conditions were so horrific that slaves would run away at the risk of being tortured and/or murdered if caught.Moneyhon 1999, pp. 32‚Äì33.Bolton 1999, p. 11. Rarely slaves who were desperate would resort to stealing food or clothes from their master though these things would also end in violence towards the slaves. Slaves' churches often preached the message of Moses and the Exodus.Bolton 1999, pp. 13‚Äì14. The largest form of rebellion was the slave family.Moneyhon 1999, p. 26. Although slave marriages were illegal, many informal relationships were honored by plantation owners who thought a family would keep the slaves from rebelling.Moneyhon 1999, p. 31. Planters often used threats against the slave's family such as selling members away, torture, rape and even murder as methods of quelling rebellion. Relationships also happened between slaves on different plantations and between slaves and their owners.Bolton 1999, p. 14. In a very unusual situation, one female slave named Abby Guy sued her owner for freedom in 1855 and won two jury trials, and her freedom was sustained by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1861 just as the Civil War was beginning.Mahan, Russell, Abby Guy: Race and Slavery on Trial in an 1855 Southern Court; Historical Enterprises, Santa Clara, Utah, 2017. Nothing made the slave experience more bearable. The planters had ultimate control over their slaves and helped perpetuate slavery.Arnold et al. 2002, p. 144. =Pioneer women= During the frontier period in Arkansas, women were viewed as uncritical and were generally kept indoors. Southern churches often linked the definitions of slavery and marriage in the Bible, thus Southerners viewed an attack on slavery as an attack on families. Historiographers have indicated that men and women understood one another's roles, even though this did not fit with classical Southern republicanism of the day. Churches managed to link slavery and marriage so inextricably that poor yeoman farmers supported slavery as they viewed northern abolitionists were attacking families in addition to the institution of slavery. Pastors were heavily influenced toward this message by planters with a vested interest in the survival of slavery. The Turning of the Tune: Traveller Playing the \\"Arkansas Traveller,\\" lithograph by Currier and Ives, 1870 Similar to slaves, women were often brought along to the frontier with men looking to make a living in the Arkansas delta. These women were transported from their social circles in town to an isolated frontier homestead and a hardscrabble existence. Although the Victorian ideals of men and women maintaining different spheres of influence still held strong in communities, the system broke down on the frontier when survival took priority over the social contract.Gatewood and Whayne 1993, pp. 6‚Äì7. Women were often tasked with maintaining the property's day-to-day operations while their husbands were away conducting business. This included dealing with slave overseers or the farm's labor itself.Arnold et al 2002, p. 119. This break from Victorian principles often went unacknowledged by frontier men and women, however. Many women founded the first marks of civilization in their areas, including schools and churches. Women often met with other women at church and had many superficial friendships to repel loneliness. Health care on the frontier was the responsibility for women, as very few doctors were available. If an entire household fell ill, a neighboring woman was responsible for nursing them back to health. Childbirth also weighed on women as a risky proposition that often resulted in the death of the mother. As a result, the process was feared, dreaded, and often went unmentioned in diaries from the period. The pressures of childbirth, being the primary health care provider and chief farm operator upon their husband's departure gave many frontier women anxiety. Early years of the state Arkansas State House at Little Rock The question of statehood was first raised by National Republican Benjamin Desha in 1831 in the Little Rock Arkansas Advocate. This position was contrary to the Democrats and The Family, who feared that the taxation required to maintain state government would be onerous on the state's meager population. Arkansas's Territorial Delegate and Family member Ambrose Sevier shared this concern about high taxes; however his inability to vote with Andrew Jackson to oppose the Whigs, the National Bank and other various economic policies eventually made him more amenable to statehood.Bolton 1999, p. 20. When it was announced that Michigan would be applying for statehood as a free state, Sevier knew the abolitionists would have a numerical advantage in the U.S. Senate unless Arkansas also entered as a slave state as a result of the Missouri Compromise. Both states applied for statehood, and both were initially denied by congressional Whigs because they were Democratic strongholds.Scroggs 1961, pp. 234‚Äì235 Arkansas and Michigan both began to draw up state constitutions despite the ruling.Arnold, et al 2002, p. 107. The issue of representation again brought up the topic of slavery when southeast Arkansas proposed a three-fifths rule in order to count the numerous slaves held in the region.Scroggs 1961, p. 238. Northwest Arkansas wanted to proportion the congressional districts based on only free white men, which would give them a political advantage.Bolton 1999, pp. 20‚Äì21.Gatewood and Whayne 1993, p. 19. Eventually a geographic compromise was struck, with eight representatives from the northwest, eight representatives from the southeast, and one from a central district.Scroggs 1961, p. 241. After this compromise was approved, the Arkansas Constitution was sent to Washington for approval. After a 25-hour session in the House over the slavery issue, the Arkansas Constitution was approved.Scroggs 1961, p. 243. President Andrew Jackson approved the bill creating the State of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. =Banking crisis= Arkansas's economy was in poor shape in the period leading up to statehood and was not in a position to support state government functions. Tax rates were very low in all Southern states controlled by planters, and Arkansas was no exception. Most planters did not carry a lot of cash and were usually indebted to cotton factories most months of the year. The little extra cash planters had was usually invested in slaves or land, leaving most plantations in the margins for long periods of time. The northwest parts of Arkansas that did not rely on cotton production relied on a cash scarce economy that consisted of bartering for necessities. Although farmers produced enough goods to sell, they were locked into the local market and were unable to transport their goods to other markets, keeping the region cash-poor. The Federal government gave land to the state, to be sold for seed money to start a treasury for Arkansas.Worley 1949, p. 179. These funds were quickly wasted, and since frontier Arkansas did not offer many services to its citizens, revenues from taxes and fees were incapable of supporting the state government. President Jackson's Specie Circular also hurt the state economy by forcing land purchases to be made with gold and silver rather than paper money. In addition to affecting private citizens who were land speculating, the policy stymied state revenues since Arkansas had been relying on the tax revenue from each land purchase as its primary source of income.Worley 1949, p. 184. James Conway Arkansas considered selling bonds to raise funds, but the frontier state remained an unknown and was not seen as a safe investment. The state also lacked agencies capable of issuing bonds, until Governor James Conway signed acts which chartered two banks during Arkansas's first legislative session, a State Bank and a Real Estate Bank. This system had contemporaries in many other states. The Real Estate Bank was to be privately owned by shareholders, but too few shareholders bought in, causing the state to fund both banks. A showdown on the state legislature floor ended with knives being drawn. President of the Real Estate Bank/Speaker of the Arkansas House John Wilson killed state legislator Joseph Anthony after Anthony offered a bill that criticized Wilson's management of the Real Estate Bank. Wilson was acquitted of murder but expelled from the legislature.Fletcher 1989, p. 54. Wilson was reelected in 1840, and later had to be restrained in another knife fight. In 1836, Arkansas was to be the recipient of funds from the Deposit and Distribution Act, rumored by some to be as much as $1 million ($ million in today's dollars).Worley 1949, p. 185. A very important sources of seed money for the State Bank; the program encountered a harsh recession that limited its effectiveness. Treasurer William Woodruff had trouble cashing the first two installments of $45,583.83 and $50,000 ($ and $ today) at the two banks in Natchez, Mississippi due to a bank run.Worley 1949, p. 186. Since the deposits were going to a state bank, the cash-strapped banks couldn't simply borrow the money from the state of Arkansas.Worley 1949, p. 187. Woodruff traveled to Washington D.C., where he received replacement drafts on Louisiana, Kentucky, and Ohio banks from United States Treasurer John Campbell, but encountered the same troubles in those states.Worley 1949, p. 188. The problems Woodruff was encountering would become known as the Panic of 1837, a recession that took many years to recover from. Arkansas would only receive $45,583.83 of federal money, the amount of the first check which was ultimately settled by the Natchez banks.Worley 1949, p. 190. While Woodruff was trying to acquire the Distribution Act funds, the Arkansas State Banks had opened in Arkansas Post, Batesville, Fayetteville, Little Rock, and Washington and had been loaning money based on the notes given to Woodruff from various other states.Worley 1964, p. 67. Further, the bonds issued by the banks were not selling as anticipated, leaving the institutions without much of their anticipated seed money.Worley 1964, p. 71. Both banks would fail within a decade, with the bonds they had issued becoming entangled in legally questionable deals. Eventually the bonds fell into the hands of London banker James Holford, and they would come to be known as the \\"Holford Bonds\\", valued at $1,239,526.82 ($ million today) in 1858.Worley 1964, pp. 73. The issue of whether or not the bonds were a legitimate state debt and whether or not they would be repaid would be a political issue in the state throughout the 1800s.Worley 1964, pp. 71‚Äì2. =Mexican War= Hempstead Court House Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of Washington to the Texas border involved the town in the Texas Revolution of 1835‚Äì36. Some evidence suggests Sam Houston and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834. When the fighting began a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the eastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battlefields. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry. =Late antebellum period= The young state began to show its first signs of improving beyond a frontier wilderness in the 1850s. The growing need for cotton gave many Arkansans an avenue to become involved in market economy for the first time, a transition that made the state significantly more prosperous. At the time, the most efficient way to grow cotton was a plantation-style system, and this quickly became the norm in the southeast part of Arkansas. During the late antebellum period, most Arkansans were identified with farming and ranching. Fewer worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, and wagon builders and fewer still as lawyers, doctors, and teachers. This economic shift also allowed some Arkansans to work outside the factory or field as artisans, including James Black who is credited with creating the first Bowie Knife in Arkansas during the period. Improving transportation also helped the state's economy grow. The Southwest Trail and Butterfield Overland Mail were major roads in the state, and steamboats began using the state's rivers for commerce. Arkansas increased its cotton production from in 1840 to in 1850.Arnold et al 2002, pp. 140‚Äì141. Arkansas and the southeast grew rapidly due to cotton, but its use of the plantation system would ultimately set the state and region behind the rest of the nation for decades.Arnold et al 2002, p. 135. Southeast Arkansas became significantly more prosperous than the northwestern highlands, causing a rift to form between the two regions. Henry Rector Although the slave issue had been tabled following the Missouri Compromise, it again came to the forefront when California's admission to the Union threatened the political balance between free and slave states. John Roane, William Sebastian, Solon Borland, and Robert Johnson began rallying support for the Southern cause in Arkansas, including discussing secession. However, most Arkansans were looking to compromise and preserve the Union. After the Compromise of 1850, several Family members in favor of secession acquired political office, including Elias Conway as governor. Thomas Hindman, a lawyer from Helena and strong supporter of Southern rights, acquired the congressional seat in Arkansas's northern district with the support of the Family.Ferguson 1965, p. 4. Hindman would later side with Henry Rector against the Family, and both were successful in 1860.Ferguson 1965, pp. 6‚Äì7. During this time, the nation was continuing to grapple with the slavery issue. The Dred Scott v. Sandford decision and John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry kept slavery in the news. The creation of a Republican party who wanted to restrict the spread of slavery gave abolitionists a new option at the polls. Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860 when Rector became the first governor from outside the Family. Although Arkansans were leery of Lincoln, they were unsure of Rector's position with regard to secession.Ferguson 1965, p. 13.Dougan 1976, p. 35. Hindman, Johnson, and Edward Gantt continued to advocate the Southern rights cause along with those loyal to the Family.Ferguson 1965, p. 15. South Carolina voted to secede in December 1860, and Hindman called for a secession vote, a move backed by Rector.Ferguson 1965, p. 19. The governor also forced the surrender of the garrison in Little Rock after rumors of Lincoln reinforcing the outfit.Dougan 1965, pp. 41‚Äì42. A vote in February 1861 showed Arkansas in favor of a convention on secession but the elected delegates voted to remain in the Union.Bolton 1999, p. 22 The convention was close but favored the Union, mirroring the demographics of Arkansas. Northwest Arkansas was mostly pro-Union and had a slight population majority, and the southeast primarily in favor of secession.Ferguson 1965, p. 23. President Lincoln demanded troops be sent, including some Arkansans, to quell the rebellion following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter on April 4, 1861. Governor Rector denied the request and ordered troops the state militia to take Fort Smith from federal control.Dougan 1965, p. 61. Secession was again put to a vote at the state convention on May 6. Given the recent events, less than 10% of the delegates voted to remain in the Union.Dougan 1965, p. 62. Chairman David Walker requested another vote in the interest of obtaining a unanimous decision. Only Isaac Murphy cast a ballot against secession for the second vote, officially ending Arkansas's membership in the Union. Civil War and Reconstruction =Secession and Civil War= mustered in at Washington Support for the Southern cause was great immediately following secession. Many towns sent enthusiastic men with hunting rifles to Little Rock prepared to fight. Citizens across the state thought victory over the lazy Northerners would come swiftly. Some anti-war organizations formed in northwest Arkansas such as the Arkansas Peace Society, but members of these groups were usually arrested and charged with treason or forced to join Confederate ranks. Geographically Arkansas was a very important state during the war, giving the Rebels control of the Mississippi River and tenuous holds on Missouri, Louisiana and Indian Territory to the west. Benjamin McCulloch was ordered to defend north Arkansas and Indian Territory; however he elected to lead his troops in to Missouri in support of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price's Missouri State Guard, leading to the Battle of Wilson's Creek near Springfield, Missouri. This bloody battle shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and painless victory for the South. Once it became apparent to Arkansans and the nation that the war would not be a quick and painless proposition, excitement began to temper. Unpopular Confederate programs like higher taxes and a draft from which one could be exempted from by owning 20 or more slaves became major issues for civilians in addition to the Confederate soldiers losing battles such as the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. Casualties were high for both sides at the Battle of Shiloh, a function of better rifles, but also poor battlefield medicine. Both sides battled disease, poor nutrition, and transportation issues throughout the war. Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862 The Union began an offensive across Arkansas in early 1862 in which General Samuel Curtis led troops near Leetown, where the Battle of Pea Ridge occurred. After securing a Union victory, Curtis swept across the state to Helena. Curtis intended to knock Arkansas out of the war by capturing Little Rock. However, reinforcements arrived in Spring 1862 under General William Steele. General Thomas C. Hindman, although recently defeated at the Battle of Cotton Plant, attempted to return northwest Arkansas to Confederate control. The Battle of Prairie Grove was essentially a stalemate, but Hindman's unit withdrew to Van Buren and was driven from the region completely by December 1862. Union troops defeated a Confederate attack in the Battle of Fayetteville on April 18, 1863, but a week later abandoned Northwest Arkansas and retreated to Missouri for the summer.Mahan, Russell L. Fayetteville, Arkansas, in the Civil War. Historical Byways, Bountiful, Utah, 2003. Bombardment and capture of Fort Hindman at Arkansas Post in 1863 The war began to turn against the Confederates in 1863, losing at the Battle of Helena despite a coordinated attack by generals Theophilus H. Holmes, Sterling Price, John S. Marmaduke, and James Fleming Fagan. The Siege of Vicksburg concluded as a Union victory the same day, severely compromising the Rebels' control of the Mississippi River. Later in the year the Union used the post at Helena to capture Little Rock, forcing the Confederate government to relocate, with the state archives, to Washington. Despite controlling the state capitol, the Union hold on the state was tenuous. Guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and small towns throughout the war.Arnold et al 2002, p. 200. Bands of guerrillas often stole from houses and burned fields wherever the Union or Confederate armies were not present. The last major fighting within the state occurred during the Camden Expedition (March 23 ‚Äì May 2, 1864). The expedition was a military campaign in southern and central Arkansas which involved Union forces stationed at Little Rock and Fort Smith under the command of Major General Frederick Steele. The plan called for Steele's force to march to Shreveport, Louisiana, where it would link up with an amphibious expedition led by Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks and Rear Admiral David D. Porter, whose force was to advance up the Red River Valley. Once joined, the Union force was to strike into Texas. But the two pincers never converged, and Steele's columns suffered terrible losses in a series of battles with Confederate forces led by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price and Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. Price's Missouri Raid in October 1864 The victory by Confederates in the Red River Campaign and its Arkansas segment, the Camden Expedition, opened a brief window of opportunity for Arkansas Confederates. Missouri General Joseph Shelby was dispatched to northeast Arkansas with his cavalry brigade and began recruiting. Throughout the summer of 1864, Confederate strength in northeast Arkansas steadily grew with many men who had either deserted from their previous commands or become separated, returning to Confederate Service. The last formation of new Confederate units occurred during this time with the formation of the 45th through the 48th Arkansas Mounted Infantry units.Sellmeyer, Deryl P.: \\"Jo Shelby's Iron Brigade\\", Pelican Publishing Company, 2007, , page 184 Several existing Arkansas units were converted to Mounted Infantry and dispatched to northeast Arkansas. Shelby was eventually able to seriously threaten vital Union lines of communication along the Arkansas River between Helena and Little Rock, and for a while it appeared that Confederates would mount a serious attempt to retake the Capitol in Little Rock. However, Confederate authorities in Richmond were pressuring General Kirby Smith to dispatch some of his infantry to reinforce Confederate armies east of the Mississippi. This caused uproar with the Arkansas Confederate infantry units and as a compromise, General Smith approved a plan by Major General Sterling Price to organize a large-scale raid into Missouri that would coincide with the November 1864 Presidential Elections.Suderow, Bryce A. \\"Pt 1 Natl. Archives Material\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 5/15/2011, Accessed 20 March 2013, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs62x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=23980 Many Arkansas troops would participate in the last Confederate offensive operation in the Trans- Mississippi Department when General Price lead a large cavalry raid into Missouri in the fall of 1864. Following Price's defeat at the Battle of Westport in on October 23, 1864, most of the Arkansas cavalry units returned to the state and were furloughed for the remainder of the war. Regimental Colors of the Third Arkansas (1863‚Äì1865) When the war ended, the Third Arkansas surrendered with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox, Virginia on April 9, 1865. The Remnants of Major General Patrick Cleburne's Division of Arkansas Troops surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Bennett Place near Durham Station, North Carolina on April 26, 1865. The Jackson Light Artillery was among the last of the Confederate troops east of the Mississippi to surrender. The Jackson Light Artillery aided in the defense of Mobile and surrendered with the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. The battery spiked their guns and surrendered at Meridian, Mississippi, May 11, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R., \\"Jackson Light Artillery (Thrall's Battery)\\", Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 30 January 2011, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/jackson.html The Arkansas infantry regiments assigned to General E. Kirby Smith's Department of the Trans- Mississippi were surrendered on May 26, 1865.Field, Ron, The Confederate Army, 1861‚Äì1865 (4), Virginia & Arkansas, Osprey Publishing, 2006, , page 23, When the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered, all of the Arkansas infantry regiments were encamped in and around Marshall, Texas, as war-ravaged Arkansas was no longer able to provide adequate sustenance to the army. The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering.Howerton, Bryan, \\"Re: 17th/1st/35th/22nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment.\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 October 2011, Accessed 26 October 2011, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=24907 Most of the Arkansas Cavalry units were surrendered by Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson, Commander of the Military Sub-District of Northeast Arkansas and Southeast Missouri. General Thompson agreed to surrender his command at Chalk Bluff on May 11, 1865, and agreed to have his men assemble at Wittsburg and Jacksonport to lay down their arms and receive their paroles. The cavalry units formally surrendered and were paroled at Wittsburg on May 25, 1865 or at Jacksonport on June 5, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Jacksonport 1865 surrender list?\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 1 January 2004, Accessed 1 January 2012, http://history- sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=6006 Many smaller commands surrendered at various Union posts, including Fort Smith, Pine Bluff and Little Rock in May and June 1865. =Emancipation= After General Benjamin Butler decided to treat slaves flocking to his Union lines as contraband of war, plantation owners began moving their slaves far away from Union armies. Some planters moved south to Brazil during the war, including Arkansans. Congress passed the Confiscation Act of 1862 that stated if their master was fighting for the South; a slave could gain freedom by crossing behind Union lines. Following the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation defined the impetus of further fighting to be slavery. This kept the United Kingdom out of the war, who were rumored to ready to help the Confederate cause but did not want to be viewed as promoting slavery. Many slaves sought freedom in the North, but arrived only to work on plantations for meager wages since cotton was still an important commodity. =Reconstruction Era= U.S. Colored Troops mustered out at Little Rock, 1866. Following the war, the Southern economy was in shambles, including Arkansas. The cost of the war effort, loss of human capital, and Confederate currency losing value were serious issues for the south in addition to the destruction of property, infrastructure, and crops. Emancipated blacks also rushed out of the south following the war. Abraham Lincoln's moderate ten percent plan allowed the Confederate states to return once 10% of their 1860 voters pledged allegiance to the United States and emancipation. A constitutional convention elected Isaac Murphy provisional governor, the lone vote against secession in the 1861 convention. Confederate loyalists quickly labeled Murphy as a traitor and compromised his effectiveness. Arkansas's two senators Elisha Baxter and William Fishback were denied seating in Washington by the Radical Republicans who thought Lincoln's policies were too lenient. Confederate governor Harris Flanagin brought state documents back from Washington and retired after the war. The Arkansas Constitution was redrawn in 1864 with the provisions necessitated by the 10% plan. When Lincoln was shot April 15, 1865, the hopes of a painless restoration of the Union died as well. The southeast Arkansas planters tried several avenues to maintain cotton production despite emancipation. The system of sharecropping eventually became most popular, allowing individuals to use farmland, seed, tools and a dwelling provided by the landowner. At season end he received a share of the crop (which in turn was used to pay off local merchants who had provided credit for living expenses.) The duty of supervising these contracts between newly freed slaves and planters was the responsibility of the federal Freedman's Bureau. Many plantation owners despised paying the same slaves that had run off from their plantation years earlier. Blacks began using their own schools and churches for the first time. Following the frustrations of losing the war and slavery, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) became the military arm of the Democratic party in much of the south, including Arkansas. Tasked with keeping blacks as well as white Republicans on plantations and away from the polls, the KKK and other groups like the Bald Knobbers reigned terror throughout the state for years. President Andrew Johnson granted pardons to many leading Confederates. The Confederate veterans in Arkansas formed a conservative political party to oppose the Unionists, lead at first by Augustus Garland. The strong anti- Unionist feelings in the state were evident when Arkansas voters refused to ratify the 14th amendment, guaranteeing citizenship, due process, and equal protection to freedmen, and in fact passed laws restricting freedmen. Once it became clear the South would not return to the Union easily, the Military Reconstruction Act was passed in 1867. Arkansas became a military territory under General Edward Ord.Herndon 1922, p. 110. University of Arkansas, founded by the General Assembly in 1868, is one of many public universities in the state. General Ord kept Governor Murphy in power but dissolved the state legislature. Republicans called a convention in Little Rock in April 1867 in order to discuss how Arkansas could return to the Union. Freedmen began to participate in politics through organizations such as the Union League, including registering blacks for the upcoming election. The election selected seventy delegates to a constitutional convention, composed primarily of Radical Republicans. The resulting constitution gave blacks full citizenship, due process, and the right to vote, as well as free public schools for all races and the establishment of the University of Arkansas. The document infuriated many conservatives and many thought it was a partisan document created for the benefit of the Republicans. The new constitution was approved in a corrupt election that also gave many offices to the Republicans. Ord certified the results, as did Congress over the president's veto, and the new Arkansas assembly ratified the 14th amendment, allowing Arkansas to reenter the Union on June 22, 1868. Powell Clayton, a Union general who had returned to live in Arkansas after the war, was elected governor in the corrupt 1868 election. Clayton took it upon himself to keep the Confederates out of power and protect the newly freed blacks. Many of his political appointments were from northern states, leading his opponents to paint him and his allies as carpetbaggers. In order to build Arkansas's infrastructure, Clayton raised taxes, another unpopular decision. Financial incentives were given to railroad companies, who ultimately laid of track by the end of Reconstruction with $9 million ($ in current dollars) in state assistance. Following the 1868 election, many residents were frustrated by the radical Republicans that had taken control of most county offices. The KKK began whitecapping throughout Arkansas, and Governor Clayton declared martial law in ten counties, later adding four more. In Mississippi County, one of the martial law counties, a racially and politically charged event called the Black Hawk War took place in 1872 that is indicative of Reconstruction. County registrar Charles Fitzpatrick rode around with an armed group of blacks, collecting taxes and issuing threats to his opponents. Fitzpatrick accused Sheriff J. B. Murray of misappropriating county funds, and the allegation became a heated argument. When the two met to shake hands at the Osceola Post Office, Murray punched Fitzpatrick, who responded by shooting and killing Murray. Upon Fitzpatrick turning himself in, a trial was held but the judge adjourned the tense court for two days before ordering Fitzpatrick to disperse his company of 200 armed men. Fitzpatrick complied, and the judge went across town to disperse a crowd of KKK members, led by former Confederate Captain Charles Bowen. Both parties dispersed but ran into each other south of town and shots were fired. Fitzpatrick was never convicted and was nominated for the state legislature, but was defeated by Hiram McVeigh. The 1872 gubernatorial election was also marked by fraud and corruption. In 1874, the Brooks-Baxter War shook Little Rock. The dispute about the legal governor of the state was settled when President Ulysses S. Grant ordered that Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters. Growth and industrialization Augustus Garland When Congress voted to approve Augustus Garland as governor a year after a corrupt 1874 election, Arkansas and other Southern states began to envision a revolution in which the old Confederate states could update their economies using Northern capital and industry to replace plantation agriculture. Contemporary Arkansans also believed cultural and social change could come with this transition.Moneyhon 1997, p. 4. Although changes did take place, the state suffered from agrarian revolt, segregation, public corruption, resistance to change and disfranchisement instead of benefiting from a new diversified economy.. The \\"New South\\" progressive ideals were especially evident in the era's business leaders such as Lee Wilson and Henry Grady. Wilson became one of the most influential Arkansans of his time by exploiting the land, labor and resources available to him. His company towns in northeast Arkansas such as Wilson and Marie attracted poor sharecroppers to his logging and farming operations. Amenities such as company housing, a town doctor, and other company-funded businesses not normally found in small towns drove his empire to grow to be the \\"World's Largest Plantation\\". After Wilson's son, Wilson Jr., and his wife returned from their England honeymoon enthralled with the Tudor style in 1925, all subsequent public buildings were built with Tudor architecture, including retrofits to all existing public structures. The town incorporated in 1959, selling the houses to the renters living in them and gaining access to tax income it was previously excluded from as a company entity. As technology advanced on the farm, fewer employees were needed and many moved from Wilson to seek other employment. The growth in industrial jobs in the Northeast and Midwest attracted many blacks from the South in the first half of the 20th century. Their migration out of the South was a reach toward a better quality of life where they could vote and live more fully as citizens. Agricultural changes also meant that farm workers were not needed in as great number. Thousands left Arkansas. During the years of World War II, blacks also migrated to the coastal communities in the Western United States, where good jobs were expanding in defense industries. =Discontent and reform= Rand McNally map of Arkansas, 1895 White farmers in Arkansas were devastated following the war, and a combination of forces aligned to further depress the agriculture sector. As the Cotton Belt expanded into Oklahoma and Texas, Arkansas farmers faced new competition from outside their region for the first time, depressing prices..Moneyhon 1997, p. 25.vThough railroads had expanded to of track in Arkansas by 1895, farmers were often charged higher rates to serve rural areas.Moneyhon 1997, pp. 27‚Äì28.. Selling cash crops into expanding (and often oversupplied) commodity markets left farmers with limited financial control of their operations. Many took crop liens, putting up their land as collateral to pay for seeds in spring.Moneyhon 1997, p. 6. Looking for a return on investment, the creditors usually insisted that farmers plant largely cotton, which remained the most valuable cash crop.Moneyhon 1997, p. 7. Many chose to plant cotton willingly, resisting calls from agricultural extension agents and university research recommending crop diversification or conservation methods.. Cash-poor farmers in the Arkansas Delta and throughout the South often resorted to tenant farming, where tenants work an owner's land in exchange for a fixed percentage of the crop yield.. By the Great Depression, most farmers in Arkansas did not own the land they worked.. Owning few assets, many in the farm economy had few ways to climb the economic ladder, leaving many Arkansans behind the prosperity seen in other states during the Gay Nineties. The Grand Prairie diversified into rice agriculture during this period; and remains a major source of rice production. Economic forces also brought change in the Ozarks, where fruit orchards and vineyards more suitable to the soil, climate, and topography had long supplanted row agriculture. As fruit production moved to more productive areas of the United States, a variety of new crops and methods swept across the hills and hollers of the Ozarks. Poultry, dairy, and cattle production spread quickly in Benton and Washington counties, but did not follow into other parts of the Ozarks... Mining and logging were prevalent where natural resources remained available.. Man with child listening at an STFU meeting Nine frustrated farmers in Prairie County formed an organization called the Grand Agricultural Wheel (usually shortened to Wheel) in 1882 to address issues relevant to the small farmer.. Although open to all races, separate black and white Wheels were often formed. Major platform issues for the Wheel included high rates of farm foreclosure, anaconda mortgages, corrupt politicians who failed to assist farming issues, and high railroad rates. Although a strong populous movement, the Wheel struggled to provide a political voice for its supporters. A partnership with the Union Labor Party for the 1888 elections did not provide results as many Wheelers were hesitant to \\"betray\\" the Democrats who had traditionally earned their vote. 19th-century Little Rock by G. H. Peters Following the disappointing results of that election, the Wheel merged with the Northern Farmer's Alliance in an attempt to combine both organizations' political clout. However, the coalition featured two factions who had the same problems but fundamentally disagreed on how to solve them: one of anti-tariff Southern Democrats and another of Northern farmers who were traditionally Republican and supported tariffs. The group became the Populists in 1890. During the late 1880s and 1890s, the Democrats worked to consolidate their power and prevent alliances among African Americans and poor whites in the years of agricultural depression. They were facing competition from the new Populist and other third parties. In 1891, state legislators passed a statute requiring a literacy test for voter registration, when more than 25% of the population could not read or write. In 1892 the state passed a constitutional amendment that imposed a poll tax and associated residency requirements for voting, which combined barriers sharply reduced the numbers of blacks and poor whites on the voter rolls, and voter participation dropped sharply. With the right to suffrage, freedmen began to participate vigorously in the political life of the state. From 1869 to 1893, more than 45 African American men were elected to seats in the state legislature. However, having consolidated power among its supporters, by 1900 the state Democratic Party began relying on all-white primaries at the county and state level. This was one more door closed against blacks, as the primaries had become the only competitive political contests; the Democratic Party primary winner was always elected. In 1900 African Americans numbered 366,984 in the state and made up 28% of the population ‚Äì together with poor whites, more than one-third of the citizens were disenfranchised.Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia, accessed 15 Mar 2008 Since they could not vote, they could not serve on juries, which were limited to voters. They were again shut out of the political process. War, prosperity, and depression =Elaine Race Riots of 1919= Race relations grew tense during this time, with many poor whites blaming freedmen for their unemployment. At the same time, blacks felt they were being exploited and underpaid by white plantation owners. In 1919, 100 frustrated black farmers gathered near Elaine to discuss how to receive a fair wage for their work on the plantations. A fight broke out when a sheriff and railroad detective arrived at the church. The deputy was wounded and the detective killed. As word spread of a \\"black uprising\\", whites came from the surrounding area to quell the \\"rebellion\\". Chaos ensued for three days in the town, with mobs roaming the street and random killings throughout. Federal troops found the town in a state of violence and were ultimately able to disarm the groups. Five whites and between 100 and 200 blacks were killed. =Progressive Era, Great Depression and the New Deal= Wife and children of a sharecropper in Washington County, Arkansas, ca. 1935 Arkansas with a rural economy based primarily on cotton, was hard-hit in the Great Depression in the United States. Severe droughts in the 1930s and the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 greatly worsened the pain caused by low commodity prices in the early 1920s. Arkansans sought reforms during the era, electing Harvey Parnell governor in 1928, a progressive campaigning on education, highways, and tax reform.. Implementation of reforms was limited by a struggling farm economy, natural disasters, and a strong tradition of low taxes.. By the 1932 elections, the situation had devolved beyond the capacity of state assistance. Arkansans supported Franklin Roosevelt in huge numbers, while also electing the conservative Democrat J. M. Futrell on a retrenchment platform.. The Agricultural Adjustment Act restored cotton prices and FDR's numerous federal relief programs, such as the CCC and WPA provided jobs primarily for unemployed men and for women who were heads of family.Sandra Taylor Smith, \\"The Civilian Conservation Corps in Arkansas, 1933‚Äì1942.\\" (1992) online . Hattie Caraway (1878‚Äì1950) was the first woman elected to serve a full term as a United States Senator. She was appointed to succeed her husband who died in office in 1931. She was reelected in her own right in January 1932. She was reelected to a full term in November 1932, with considerable help from Louisiana Senator Huey Long. She won another term in 1938. However, in 1944, Caraway ran fourth in the Democratic primary, losing her Senate seat to freshman congressman J. William Fulbright, the young, dynamic former president of the University of Arkansas who had already gained a national reputation.Nancy Hendricks, Senator Hattie Caraway: An Arkansas Legacy (2013) =World War II= World War II restored prosperity.

The Jerome War Relocation Center in Drew County operated from October 1942 to June 1944 and held circa 8,000 persons. =Civil rights era= Time magazine (October 7, 1957), featuring paratroopers at Little Rock. In one of the first major cases of the Civil Rights Movement, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Topeka Board of Education (1954) that segregated schools were unconstitutional. Both of Arkansas' U.S. Senators (J. William Fulbright and John L. McClellan) and all six of its U.S. Representatives were among those who signed the Southern Manifesto in response. The Little Rock Nine incident of 1957 centered around Little Rock Central High School brought Arkansas to national attention. After the Little Rock School Board had voted to begin carrying out desegregation in compliance with the law, segregationist protesters physically blocked nine black students recruited by the NAACP from entering the school. Governor Orval Faubus deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists, and only backed down after Judge Ronald Davies of U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted an injunction from the U.S. Department of Justice compelling him to withdraw the Guard.Graeme Cope, \\"'A Thorn in the Side'?

President Dwight D. Eisenhower, on the request of Little Rock Mayor, deployed the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock and federalized the Arkansas National Guard to protect the students and ensure their safe passed to school. Little Rock's four public high schools were closed in September 1958, only reopening a year later. Integration across all grades was finally achieved in fall 1972. The Little Rock school episode drew international attention to the treatment of African Americans in the United States.Mary L. Dudziak, \\"The Little Rock Crisis and Foreign Affairs: Race, Resistance, and the Image of American Democracy,\\" Southern California Law Review 70 (1996) pp: 1641‚Äì1716. Changing racial attitudes and growth in jobs have created a New Great Migration of African Americans back to metropolitan areas in the developing South, especially to such states as Georgia, North Carolina and Texas. These have developed many knowledge industry jobs. President Bill Clinton Bill Clinton, born in Hope, served nearly twelve years as the 40th and 42nd Arkansas governor before being elected 42nd president in the 1992 election.

The film marks the directorial debut of Academy Award-winning documentary film producer Charles H. Ferguson. The film premiered January 22, 2007 at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. The film opened in limited release in the United States on July 27, 2007, playing in two theaters. , the film had grossed $1.4 million, and had been released on DVD. Interviews To a large extent the film consists of interviews with the people who were involved in the initial Iraqi occupation authority and the ORHA (the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, later replaced by the CPA, the Coalition Provisional Authority). Thirty-five people are interviewed who have since become disillusioned by what they experienced at the time. In particular, many of those interviewed claim that the inexperience of the core members of the Bush administration ‚Äî and their refusal to seek, acknowledge or accept input from more experienced outsiders ‚Äî was at the root of the disastrous occupation effort. Others include former soldiers stationed in Iraq, as well as authors and journalists critical of the war planning. Those interviewed are: *General Jay Garner, who briefly ran the reconstruction before being replaced by L. Paul Bremer *Ambassador Barbara Bodine, who was placed in charge of the Baghdad embassy *Richard Armitage, former deputy secretary of the State Department *Robert Hutchings, former chairman of the National Intelligence Council *Col.

Slocombe *Amazia Baram, professor of middle east history, former advisor to Bush Administration *Aida Ussayran, former deputy minister for human rights in Iraq Content No End in Sight is a documentary film that focuses on the two-year period following the American invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The film asserts that serious mistakes made by the administration of President George W. Bush during that time were the cause of ensuing problems in Iraq, such as the rise of the insurgency, a lack of security and basic services for many Iraqis, sectarian violence and, at one point, the risk of complete civil war. The documentary notes the lack of forward planning for the post invasion governance of Iraq. It critiques Rumsfeld for not providing enough troops to maintain order, which led to the absence of martial law after the country was conquered. The ORHA had identified at least twenty crucial government buildings and cultural sites in Bagdad, but none of the locations were protected; only the oil ministry was guarded. With no police force or national army to maintain order, ministries and buildings were looted for their desks, tables, chairs, phones, and computers. Large machines and rebars from buildings were also looted. Among those pillaged were Iraqi museums, containing priceless artifacts from some of the earliest human civilizations, which No End in Sight suggested had sent chilling signals to the average Iraqi that the American forces did not intend to maintain law and order. Eventually, the widespread looting turned into an organized destruction of Baghdad. The destruction of libraries and records, in combination with the \\"De- Ba'athification\\", had ruined the bureaucracy that existed prior to the U.S. invasion. ORHA staff reported that they had to start from scratch to rebuild the government infrastructure. Rumsfeld initially dismissed the widespread looting as no worse than rioting in a major American city and archival footage of General Eric Shinseki stating his belief of the required troop numbers reveals the awareness of the lack of troops. According to No End in Sight, there were also three especially grave mistakes made by L. Paul Bremer, the head of the CPA: *Stopping preparations for the formation of an interim Iraqi government *Bremer's first official executive order implementing \\"De- Ba'athification\\" in the early stages of the occupation, as he considered members disloyal. Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party counted as its members a huge majority of Iraq's governmental employees, including educational officials and some teachers, as it was not possible to attain such positions unless one had membership. By order of the CPA, these skilled and often apolitical individuals were banned from holding any positions in Iraq's new government. *Bremer's second official executive order disbanding all of Iraq's military entities, which went against the advice of the U.S. military and made 500,000 young men unemployed. The U.S. Army had wanted the Iraqi troops retained, as they knew the locals and could maintain order, but Bremer refused as he felt that they could be disloyal. However, many former Iraqi soldiers, many with extended families to support, then decided that their best chance for a future was to join a militia force. The huge arms depots were available for pillaging by anyone who wanted weapons and explosives, so the former Iraqi soldiers converged on the military stockpiles. The U.S. knew about the location of weapon caches, but said that it lacked the troops to secure them; ironically, these arms would later be used against the Americans and new Iraqi government forces. The film cites these three mistakes as the primary causes of the rapid deterioration of occupied Iraq into chaos, as the collapse of the government bureaucracy and army resulted in a lack of authority and order. It was the Islamic fundamentalists that moved to fill this void, so their ranks swelled with many disillusioned Iraqi people. Reception The film holds a Metacritic score of 89 out of 100, based on 27 reviews. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called it \\"exacting, enraging\\" and said \\"[Charles Ferguson] presents familiar material with impressive concision and impact, offering a clear, temperate and devastating account of high-level arrogance and incompetence.\\" Scott said \\"most of the movie deals with a period of a few months in the spring and summer of 2003, when a series of decisions were made that did much to determine the terrible course of subsequent events\\" and wrote \\"the knowledge and expertise of military, diplomatic and technical professionals was overridden by the ideological certainty of political loyalists.\\" Scott also remarked, \\"It might be argued that since Mr. Bremer, Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Wolfowitz declined to appear in the film, Mr. Ferguson was able to present only one side of the story. But the accumulated professional standing of the people he did interview, and their calm, detailed insistence on the facts, makes such an objection implausible.\\" Scott concluded, \\"It‚Äôs a sober, revelatory and absolutely vital film.\\" Rob Nelson of the Village Voice said \\"Masterfully edited and cumulatively walloping, Charles Ferguson's No End in Sight turns the well-known details of our monstrously bungled Iraq war into an enraging, apocalyptic litany of fuck-ups.\\" Nelson said the film \\"is certainly a film about failure, perhaps the ultimate film about failure. Or maybe a film about the ultimate failure?\\", also writing that the film \\"is less a work of investigation (or activism) than history.\\" Rob Nelson wrote, \\"Focusing on the war itself, Ferguson is chiefly interested in compiling a filmed dossier of incompetence‚Äînot so much to argue that the war could have been won and won early, but to suggest that the magnitude of arrogant irresponsibility will carry aftershocks as far into the future as the mind can imagine.\\" Nelson also said, \\"Ferguson's approach is at once relentless and, with the help of Campbell Scott's flat narration, chillingly calm and composed.\\" Nelson wrote, \\"The evidence speaks for itself, and No End in Sightaddressed to those who'll be swayed against the war by ineptitude more than immoralityis the rare American documentary that doesn't appear to preach to the converted, or at least not only to the converted\\", also saying \\"For those of us who've opposed the war for years, the movie is at once intensely frightening and, it must be admitted, disturbingly reassuring.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 stars and said \\"This is not a documentary filled with anti-war activists or sitting ducks for Michael Moore. Most of the people in the film were important to the Bush administration.\\" Ebert concluded, \\"I am distinctly not comparing anyone to Hitler, but I cannot help being reminded of the stories of him in his Berlin bunker, moving nonexistent troops on a map, and issuing orders to dead generals.\\" At the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, No End in Sight won the Special Jury Prize for Documentaries. On January 22, 2008, No End in Sight was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 5 films nominated for a prize in the \\"Best Documentary Feature\\" category. Ferguson also received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named the film one of the Top 10 Movies of 2007, ranking it at #7.

Mecklenburg spent the early period of her career in I Squadron of the German fleet, participating in the peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. After World War I began in August 1914, the ship was mobilized with her sisters as IV Battle Squadron. She saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea against Russian naval forces, and as a guard ship in the North Sea.

The Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first Naval Law in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The Wittelsbachs were broadly similar to the Kaiser Friedrichs, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout. Mecklenburg was long overall; she had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six coal-fired Thornycroft boilers and six coal-fired cylindrical boilers. Mecklenburgs powerplant was rated at , which gave her a top speed of . The ship had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men. The ship's primary armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns and twelve 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. Her weaponry was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four on the broadside. Her armored belt was thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces and reduced to on either end of the hull. The deck was thick. Mecklenburgs main battery turrets had of armor plating.  Service history  Mecklenburgs keel was laid down on 15 May 1900 at AG Vulcan in Stettin, under construction number 248. She was ordered under the contract name \\"F\\", as a new unit for the fleet. Mecklenburg, the last ship of her class, was launched on 9 November 1901; the ceremony was attended by Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Fitting-out work proceeded faster on Mecklenburg than on her sister , and so the former was commissioned on 25 June 1903, a full year before Schwaben. Mecklenburg cost 22,329,000 marks. Immediately following her commissioning, Mecklenburg began sea trials, which lasted until mid-December 1903. She was assigned to II Division of I Squadron, alongside the battleships and . Mecklenburg had to enter the drydock at Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) at Wilhelmshaven for minor improvements and repairs following her trials; this work lasted until the end of February 1904. After these modifications, Mecklenburg took part in individual and squadron training exercises, and a fleet review for the visiting British King Edward VII in June. The following month, the German fleet went on a cruise to Britain, the Netherlands, and Norway that lasted until August. Mecklenburg then participated in the annual autumn fleet exercises, which took place in late August and September, and a winter training cruise in November and December. Starting in mid-December 1904, Mecklenburg went into Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance, which lasted until the beginning of March 1905. After emerging from drydock, Mecklenburg joined her sister ship on a cruise through the Skagerrak to Kiel. While steaming through the Great Belt on 3 March, Mecklenburg struck the Hatter Reef off Sams√∏, Denmark, and became stuck. Another sister ship, , and the light cruiser were sent to assist Wittelsbach in pulling Mecklenburg free of the reef. Mecklenburg then steamed under her own power to Kiel, where dockyard workers discovered a large dent in her bottom. Repair work was completed at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven by 20 April, allowing her to participate in the normal routine of training cruises and maneuvers with the fleet for the remainder of the year. During this period, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet while it was moored in Swinem√ºnde. From mid- February to the end of March 1906, Mecklenburg was in the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. The training routine continued without incident through 1907 but, in early April 1908, a major accident in one of Mecklenburgs broadside torpedo rooms nearly sank her. Water began to flood the ship and could only be stopped by sealing the torpedo tubes from the outside; repairs lasted until May. Mecklenburg participated in a training cruise to the Azores in July and August 1908. She also won the Kaiser's Schie√üpreis (Shooting Prize) for the most accurate gunnery in her squadron, along with the battleship . In mid-December, she returned once again to Wilhelmshaven for the yearly overhaul. The years 1909 and 1910 passed uneventfully for Mecklenburg, with the same pattern of training cruises and maneuvers as in previous years. She began her annual overhaul on 2 December 1910 and returned to service on 7 March 1911, though only briefly. On 31 July, Mecklenburg was replaced by the new dreadnought battleship ; Mecklenburg was then decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division in the North Sea. On 9 May 1912, she was transferred to the Reserve Division in the Baltic. She returned briefly to active service in 1912 from 9 to 12 May to move her from the North Sea to the Baltic, and again from 14 August to 28 September to participate in the fleet exercises that year. During the maneuvers, she served in III Squadron. =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Mecklenburg and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. The squadron was initially allocated to the North Sea, but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September. Starting on 3 September, IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic in the direction of the Svenska H√∂garna islands. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off Windau the next day. From 5 December to 2 April 1915, Mecklenburg and the rest of the squadron were assigned to guard duty in the North Sea, based in the mouth of the Elbe. In May 1915, IV Squadron, including Mecklenburg, was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. Mecklenburg and her sisters were then based in Kiel. From 8 to 12 May, she participated in a sweep toward Gotland and Bogsk√§r, to support the assault on Libau. Mecklenburg and the other ships stood off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings, but this did not occur. On 10 May, after the invasion force had entered Libau, the British submarines and spotted IV Squadron, but were too far away to make an attack. After the operation, Mecklenburg and the rest of IV Squadron returned to the Elbe for guard duties, which lasted until 4 July. The next day, Mecklenburg departed for Kiel in preparation for a major operation in the Baltic. She proceeded to Danzig, and on 11 July departed for a sweep to Gotska Sand√∂n; another patrol to western Gotland followed on 21‚Äì22 July. Mecklenburg then steamed from Danzig to Libau on 2 August, where she joined another foray toward Gotska Sand√∂n from 7 to 10 August. Mecklenburg and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that assaulted the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, due to the scarcity of escorts. The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships. Mecklenburg took part in two sweeps to Huvudsk√§r on 9‚Äì11 and 21‚Äì23 September. On 17 December she ran aground in the entrance to the harbor of Libau, but was towed free without suffering any damage. She was to replace the worn-out armored cruiser in the reconnaissance forces of the fleet in the Baltic, but Mecklenburg and her sisters were removed from service shortly thereafter. By this stage of the war, the German Navy was facing severe shortages of crews, which could be alleviated by the decommissioning of older, less effective warships. Furthermore, the increasing threat from British submarines and Russian mines in the Baltic by 1916, the latter of which sank the armored cruiser , convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships from active service. On 6 January 1916, Mecklenburg left Libau bound for Kiel, arriving the following day. She was decommissioned on 24 January and placed in reserve. Mecklenburg was initially based in Kiel and used as a floating prison. In early 1918, she became a barracks ship for the crews of U-boats being repaired in Kiel. The ship was briefly retained after the German defeat at the end of World War I, but was to be discarded under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which limited the re-formed Reichsmarine to eight pre-dreadnought battleships of the and es, of which only six could be operational at any given time. Accordingly, on 25 January 1920, Mecklenburg was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to Deutsche Werke, a shipbuilder based in Kiel, on 16 August 1921 for 1,750,000 Marks, and was broken up for scrap metal that year at Kiel-Nordmole.

Taxonomy Isbrueckerichthys was erected in 1996 for Pareiorhaphis duseni and Pareiorhaphis alipionis, which were transferred to the new genus. I. epakmos was described in 2003. I. calvus and I. saxicola were described in 2006. Species There are currently five recognized species in this genus: * Isbrueckerichthys alipionis (Gosline, 1947) * Isbrueckerichthys calvus Jerep, Shibatta, E. H. L. Pereira & Oyakawa, 2006 * Isbrueckerichthys duseni (A. Miranda-Ribeiro, 1907) * Isbrueckerichthys epakmos E. H. L. Pereira & Oyakawa, 2003 * Isbrueckerichthys saxicola Jerep, Shibatta, E. H. L. Pereira & Oyakawa, 2006 Distribution Three species of Isbrueckerichthys are thought to be endemic to the Ribeira de Iguape River basin: I. duseni from the upper reaches of that basin in Paran√° State, I. alipionis from the Betari River, a tributary of rio Ribeira de Iguape, and I. epakmos from a tributary of the Juqui√° River in S√£o Paulo State. Both I. calvus and I. saxicola were collected in headwater streams of Tibagi River of the Paranapanema River basin in Paran√° State of Brazil. I. saxicola is only known from the headwater of ribeir√£o Jacutinga, in low Tibagi River basin. I. calvus is only known from c√≥rrego Juruba and ribeir√£o √Ågua dos Oito, affluents of the Taquara River of the Tibagi River basin. Description Isbrueckerichthys is composed of small- to medium-sized species up to 90.2 millimetres (3.55 in) SL. These fish have a dorsal fin with one spine and seven branched rays, and a caudal peduncle ovoid in cross- section. I. alipionis is the only species in which the teeth of the dentary and premaxilla are without a lateral cusp. I. epakmos is the only species in which mature males have a clump of hypertrophied odontodes only on the anterior portion of snout; in the other species, odontodes are also present on the lateral margins of the head. The most distinctive features of I. epakmos are the anterior portion of head ornamented with a large and rugose soft fleshy area and the presence of a clump of hypertrophied odontodes located only on anterior portion of snout, usually short and thick, directed forward or slightly upward on adult males. I. duseni has a short pectoral fin spine and a long caudal peduncle (over a third of the body length), while the remaining two species, I. calvus and I. saxicola, have long pectoral fin spines and a short caudal peduncle (about a quarter to less than a third of the body length). I saxicola exhibits minute abdominal platelets with much more than six odontodes, a plated area under the first three plates of the lateral line, an exposed portion of cleithrum bordering all the posterior margin of the opercular opening on lateral side of the body, and an exposed surface of supraoccipital flat or slightly convex. On the other hand, I. calvus has minute abdominal platelets with at most six odontodes, a nude area under the first three plates of the lateral line, an unexposed cleithrum, or when exposed, bordering just the superior portion of posterior margin of the opercular opening on lateral side of the body, and an exposed surface of supraoccipital strongly convex, with an area without odontodes at the center. Ecology Species of this genus are commonly found in small to medium headwater streams with clear, fast running, and well-oxygenated water, where the bottom is composed of rocks, boulders, and sometimes gravel. They are not tolerant to polluted or not oxygenated waters. The holotype of I. epakmos is from the Verde River; it is a small stream with clear water and moderate to strong current, with loose stones and, in some places, sand on the bottom. The type locality of I. saxicola is a small creek located near the urban area of Londrina city, flowing through a landscape of mixed open fields and riparian vegetation, sometimes with a very degraded margin. Grass or other vegetation is usually present on the margins. The stream bottom is rocky, with small to medium-sized rocks, loose stones and gravel; sometimes with sand and mud on the small pools bottom. The water is clear to turbid and moderate to strong flowing. The fishes are usually found on the bottom among rocks and stones. The type locality where some specimens of I calvus were collected is a small creek of rural region, flowing through a landscape of mixed open field, riparian vegetation and forest, sometimes with a very degraded margin. Like in the habitat of I. saxicola, vegetation is usually present on the margins, and the stream bottom is similar. The fishes were usually found along the bottom among rocks and stones, just under small waterfalls.

He spent five years in the 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons as a Cornet (the rank of Cornet was replaced by Second Lieutenant in the Army Reform Act of 1871). He took his oath of qualification at the Epiphany sessions in 1803 to become a Justice of the Peace. He was a Captain of the Lewes Troop of Yeomanry and Captain of the South Lewes Volunteer Battalion during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Shiffner was held in such high esteem locally that he was considered as a Tory candidate for Sussex in the 1807 election. John 'Mad Jack' Fuller, Shiffner's wife's second cousin, had been a Member of Parliament for Sussex since Shiffner proposed him in 1801. Fuller was becoming increasingly unpopular because of his outspoken defence of slavery in the colonies. Shiffner declined the offer and successfully ran as MP for Lewes where he sat from 1812 to 1826. On 16 December 1818 he was created a Baronet, of Coombe in the County of Sussex.

The name is a corruption of \\"Sooth Was\\", which means the \\"southern voes\\" - as with Kirkwall, it was assumed that it was a mispronunciation of \\"walls\\". South Walls forms the southern side of the harbour of Longhope. It was a tidal island until a narrow causeway, was constructed over the sandbank in 1912, which was known as the Ayre, although this name has become transferred to the causeway itself. Although sometimes considered to be a peninsula, it is an island in all but name. South Walls is a popular stopping off place for barnacle geese. Geography and geology Satellite photo of Scapa Flow, South Walls can be seen in the bottom left, below Flotta which is shaped like the letter 'c' The island, like most of the Orkney archipelago, is made up of old red sandstone with the Rousay Flagstone Group predominating.Brown, John Flett \\"Geology and Landscape\\" in Omand (2003) p.4. The island is more or less oval in shape, but there is a small promontory, called Cantick Head in the south east, which is created by Kirk Hope (Church Bay). It is separated from Hoy by an arm of the sea, also called Longhope. The area to the south of the causeway is known as Aith Hope. The fact that neither the 2001 or 2011 censuses mention South Walls in their lists of inhabited islands suggests that there is some dubiety about its status as an island. (In 2001 the General Register Office for Scotland defined an island as \\"a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland\\" and although the inclusion of islands linked man-made constructions is not clear from this definition in practice they list several separately that are joined to one another by bridges and causeways). The evidence for its island status includes: * mentioned in Livingstone's comprehensive Scottish island tables; * the Vision of Britain map of 1856 clearly shows a drying gap between the islands of Hoy and South Walls prior to the construction of the causeway across the Ayre;\\"Scotland First Series\\" Vision of Britain. Retrieved 21 September 2013. * In Jo Ben's 1529 \\"Descriptions of Orkney\\", Wais appears in a list of islands but the wording states: \\"the island is not large. There is no distinction between Hoy and Wais, but it is one island from the firth receding\\". This last phrase could be interpreted to mean \\"at low tide\\";\\"Wais\\". Orkneyar. Retrieved 21 September 2013. * Irvine's reprint of Blaeu's Atlas Novus of 1654 contains various descriptions of Orkney including:-  \\"the island of Walls, (commonly Waes);Johan Blaeu's commentary in Irvine (2006) p. 17  \\"among them Hoy Walls, whether this is two islands, or one: because about the season of equal day, when the tides goes out, they are joined with waves and sand at a narrow neck as one island; when the tide comes in and the sea is again interposed, the appearance of two lands surrounded by water is produced.\\"A. Melville from Scotia Topgraphia of 1603 in Irvine (2006) p. 63 Although it is clear that the island is inhabited as it was not listed as such by the census no reliable estimate of the current total is available. Presumably the presence of the causeway linking South Walls to Hoy has resulted in the population of the former being included with the latter for statistical purposes. History =Norse period= A reconstructed longship tacking in the wind such as Erlend and Swein may have used Hackness martello tower, one of a pair on either side of Longhope, built in 1814 Radar platform at WWII Heavy Anti Aircraft Gun site on South Walls near Wyng Gallow Tuag WWII Royal Navy Wireless Station South Walls features fairly prominently in the Norse period, partly because it was the first landfall when sailing from west Caithness or Sutherland. The Orkneyinga saga mentions the island several times, such as in Chapter XCV: :\\"Early in the winter, Earl Erlend [Harald's Son] and Swein left Th√≥rs√°, and took their course by the west coast of Scotland. They had six long-ships, all well manned. They had to row, and when they had gone some distance from Caithness, Earl R√∂gnvald's spies went out to the islands, and told him the news. Then the Earls moved their ships to Sk√°lpeid (Scapa), and Earl R√∂gnvald wished them to stay a while on board. :\\"When Swein and Erlend came west off Stour [\\"Ru Stoer in Assynt on the west coast of Sutherlandshire\\"], the former said that they should not distress themselves by rowing any further, and asked his men to put the ships about and set the sails. This action on the part of Swein was thought foolish, yet his men did as he desired them, when they had been sailing for a while the ships began to speed, because there was a fine breeze, and nothing is said of their voyage until they reached Vagaland (South Walls) in Orkney. There they heard the Earls were lying at Sk√°lpeid, off Knarrarsta√∞ir (Knarston) with thirteen ships... It was four nights before Simon's-mas when Swein, Asleif's Son decided to attack the earls during the night, but it was thought rather hazardous, as their followers were so much more numerous. Yet Swein insisted on having his own way, and so he did, because the Earl wished to follow his advice.\\" South Walls also played a crucial role in the Christianisation of Orkney. Although Christianity in the islands predated the Norse by a number of years, the Norse often remained pagan. Olaf Tryggvasson, King of Norway forced the Earl of Orkney, Sigurd Hlo√∞visson to be baptised at South Walls.Haswell-Smith, Hamish. (2004) The Scottish Islands. Edinburgh. Canongate. Earl Sigurd accepted, and remained a nominal Christian the rest of his life. However, he did so under duress - King Olaf had many valas (Norse shamans) executed by being tied and left on a skerry at ebb. This was a long and terrible wait for death, and perhaps Earl Sigurd expected a similar fate. =Modern history= Overlooking Longhope in the north east is Hackness Martello Tower and Battery. The tower, together with another on the north side at Crockness, was built in 1815 to protect British ships in the bay of Longhope against attack by American and French privateers, during the Napoleonic Wars, while they waited for a Royal Navy escort on their journey to Baltic ports. The towers were rearmed for World War I. There is a similar tower across the Bay in South East Hoy. Hackness Martello Tower and Battery is in the care of Historic Scotland. Cantick Head is well known for its lighthouse designed and built by David and Thomas Stevenson and first lit in July 1858 and automated in 1991.\\"Cantick Head Lighthouse.\\" Northern Lighthouse Board.

The Clatsop Spit was formed by Columbia River sediment brought to the coast by the river flow after the last ice age ended approximately 8500 years ago and the ocean level rose. Here it was worked over and shaped by the wind and the waves until a vast and sandy plain was formed. In regular conversation, referring to Clatsop Spit usually refers to the northern end of the spit: the area that is bound by the Pacific to the west and the Columbia River to the northeast. In the past, the spit was known as Clatsop Sands. Shipwrecks The wreck of the Peter Iredale as of May 2005 The seas around Clatsop Spit were known to be treacherous and there were many shipwrecks, including the paddle steamer General Warren in which 42 people died in the surf in 1852 and in 1859, the schooner Rambler washed up on Clatsop Spit. No trace of her crew was ever found. In 1860, the barque Leonese washed up on Clatsop Spit upside down and her crew lost. In 1883 the crew of the luxury schooner J.C. Cousins operated by the State of Oregon similarly vanished as she washed ashore. Other shipwrecks include the barquentine Makah (1888), and the bark Peter Iredale in 1906. It is estimated that since 1800 more than 2,000 vessels and close to 1,000 lives have been lost at the mouth of the Columbia River and in this context it is referred to as the Graveyard of the Pacific. Geology Clatsop Spit's Del Rey Beach looking south towards Tillamook Head After the sea level along the coast rose to its current level approximately 8,500 years ago at the end of the last ice age, seasonal prevailing winds drove the Columbia River's sandy sediment to the Washington beaches in the winter and to Oregon's Clatsop Spit during the summer months. Through this process the sandy beaches grew dynamically to their present size, but it is unlikely they will continue this fast growth. Most of the sediment generated by the Columbia River is now trapped by a series of dams before it reaches the coast. Meanwhile, when the tide is out constantly shifting onshore winds blow sand from the exposed beaches inland on to huge sand dunes. However, during the 1930s most of the spectacular dunes were deliberately controlled by the planting of grass and shrubs to prevent the natural movement of the sand. Now the sand is stabilized by the covering of vegetation and are no longer endlessly in motion, dynamically shaped by the wind. Much of the original dune area now forms a region known as Clatsop Plains. Clatsop Spit is now part of Fort Stevens State Park.

Following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 the Duchy Originals business began making losses, amounting to around ¬£3 million in 2009, and in September of that year it was announced that Duchy Originals had agreed an exclusive deal with Waitrose. From August 2010 products were relaunched under the Duchy Originals from Waitrose brand and the then range of around 200 lines was expanded to over 300. Waitrose invested heavily in the brand and sales doubled during the first three years of the exclusive arrangement. By 2013 the brand was selling in 30 countries including Australia and Japan. In the summer of 2015 the brand name was changed to Waitrose Duchy Organic. The tradition of donating royalties to charity has continued and the Prince of Wales has continued his involvement with the brand. The brands The company Duchy Originals, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund, originated the Duchy Originals brand in 1990 as a premium organic food and drink brand. It also created two other brands, Duchy Selections and Duchy Collections. Duchy Selections was a range of premium free-range (but not organic) pork and fish products and mineral waters, and Duchy Collections was a range of high quality non food products. The Duchy Originals company has never sold the goods that carry the brand names, and other than the short-lived Duchy Originals Food company venture it has not manufactured them. Instead Duchy branded products have been sold and manufactured by a number of different retail companies, all of whom have paid royalties to the Duchy Originals Company. Financial information By the end of the 1990s the brand had an annual turnover of around ¬£1 million. This had grown to ¬£4.86 million by 2006/7. Administrative expenses came to ¬£3.31 million, giving an operating profit of ¬£1.53 million. The company was badly hit by the recession in 2007 and started making a loss. For the financial year 2008/9, the company failed to make any profits and turnover dropped to ¬£2.2 million, with an operating loss of ¬£3.3 million, compared to the previous year's operating profit of ¬£57,000. Fortunes improved after the 2009 Waitrose arrangement, and by 2013 annual profits were ¬£2.8 million.  The Duchy Originals Food company  Duchy Originals' only venture into manufacturing has been the Duchy Originals Food company. This was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Duchy Originals company and it opened a factory in Launceston, Cornwall in 2006. The factory was a bakery making both sweet and savoury pastry products. The venture suffered financial problems, with the factory making a loss of ¬£447,158 in the financial year 2006/7. In 2009 the Duchy Originals company decided to sell the bakery, with one-off costs from the sale contributing towards Duchy Originals making a loss for 2009-10.  Herbal medicines  In 2008 Duchy Originals partnered with the alternative medicine company Nelsons to produce a line of herbal remedies. This led to controversy, in which leading UK scientists said that Duchy Originals promoted its herbal remedies with scientifically unsound claims. Edzard Ernst, the UK's first professor of complementary medicine, said Duchy Originals detox products were \\"outright quackery\\".Prince Charles detox 'quackery', BBC News, 10 March 2009 Subsequently, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ruled that healing claims were misleading and required the company to amend an advertising campaign promoting two herbal medicines. Mineral water In 2002 the Deeside Water Company began to produce some of its bottled mineral water for the Duchy Originals brand. In 2010 Waitrose rebranded the product as Duchy Originals from Waitrose and in 2016 the supermarket repackaged it as part of its Waitrose One premium range.  Garden tools  Gardening tools were produced under the Duchy Originals brand by the Lancashire company Caldwells until it went into administration in 2009.  Charitable giving  The company Duchy Originals Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary company of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation and donates to the charity from its profits. By 2013 the brand had raised ¬£11 million from its profits for the Prince's Charities. In Canada the proceeds from sales of Duchy Originals products are donated to the charities associated with The Prince's Charities Canada. By 2012 more than one million Canadian dollars were being raised annually in this manner.  The Duchy Future Farming programme  The Duchy Future Farming programme was set up in 2013 in partnership with the Soil Association to provide advice and support to UK farmers and growers in conducting research into organic farming methods. Participants are encouraged to carry out experiments in their own fields, and over 3000 farmers had been involved in this by 2015. A research fund offering up to ¬£25,000 is also available.

Catholic-Hierarchy. He established the Sisters of Charity in 1869. He was beatified on 18 October 2009 during the pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI; Archbishop Angelo Amato celebrated the rite of beatification on behalf of the pontiff. The second miracle required for his canonization is now under investigation. Life Ciriaco Mar√≠a Sancha y Herv√°s was born to Ambrosio Sancha and Baltasara Herv√°s in Quintana del Pidio in Spain. He was educated at the University of Salamanca where he earned a licentiate in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood on 27 June 1858. He served as the Lector of philosophical studies in the seminary of Osma. He then served in the archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba from 1862 until 1876 as chancellor-secretary and professor of moral theology in its seminary. He founded the Sisters of Charity on 5 August 1869. While the archdiocese was vacant because of the death of the archbishop in 1868, the Spanish Republican government named, without the consent of the Holy See, Father Pedro Llorente Miguel as his successor in 1873. Monsignor Jos√© Mar√≠a Orber√° Carri√≥n, who was vicar capitular, and Sancha opposed the nomination and were jailed for their opposition. The schism ended in 1874 and both were then released. =Episcopate= He was appointed titular bishop of Areopolis and auxiliary bishop of Toledo by Pope Pius IX on 28 January 1876. He was transferred to the see of √Åvila on 27 March 1882 and again to the see of Madrid on June 10, 1886. He was promoted to the metropolitan see of Valencia on 11 July 1892. =Cardinalate= He was created Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Montorio by Pope Leo XIII in the consistory of 18 May 1894. He was again transferred to the primatial and metropolitan see of Toledo on 24 March 1898 and on the same day was awarded the largely honorific title of Patriarch of the West Indies (which made him the titular head of all Spanish military bishops and chaplains). He participated in the conclave of 1903 that elected Pope Pius X. =Death= Sancha died in the beginning of 1909. Sainthood =Process and Venerable= The beatification process for Sancha commenced on 19 June 1982 under Pope John Paul II in which he was accorded with the title of Servant of God. The diocesan process commenced on 22 November 1982 and concluded following the successful accumulation of available evidence. The process was declared completed with the decree of validation from Rome on 3 July 1992. The postulation sent the Positio dossier to the officials in Rome for further investigation in 1993 while historians declared the cause clear of historical obstacles on 15 March 1994. Around a decade later - on 1 March 2005 - theologians approved the cause while the cardinal and bishop members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints also approved it on 21 June 2005. During an audience granted on 28 April 2006 to the Cardinal-Prefect of the C.C.S. - then Jos√© Saraiva Martins - Pope Benedict XVI authorized the promulgation of the decree declaring the heroic virtue of the late cardinal. This conferred upon him the title of Venerable. =Beatification= The miracle needed for beatification was investigated in Santiago de los Caballeros from 10 December 1985 until 18 December 1985 in which all medical documents and interrogatories were compiled and sent to Rome. The decree of validation for that process was issued on 13 December 1996. The medical board based in Rome approved the miracle around a decade later on 18 October 2007 while theologians did likewise on 16 May 2008. The C.C.S. followed suit on 16 December 2008. On 17 January 2009 - in an audience granted to Archbishop Angelo Amato - Pope Benedict XVI approved the decree that certified a miracle attributed to the intercession of Cardinal Sancha. The beatification celebration took place on 18 October 2009 at the metropolitan cathedral of Toledo with Amato presiding on the behalf of the pontiff. =Second miracle= The second miracle required for full sanctification was placed under investigation in Santo Domingo from 20 February 2015 until 3 March 2015.

The gunfight, despite being lesser known than either the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral or the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight, resulted in more dead. Identity and origins Where Kinch 'James' Riley came from is unknown. It is believed that he was born in Kansas, but as to where in Kansas is unknown. He first surfaced in Newton around 1869. He was thought to be suffering from tuberculosis, and was a loner. Mike McCluskie, a local gambler from Ohio and sometime lawman, took him in. Riley was often seen in the presence of McCluskie, but otherwise went unnoticed, and was never known to have been in any trouble. He wore a pair of twin Colt revolvers at all times, which McCluskie had taught him to use. The gunfight The incident began with an argument between Billy Bailey and McCluskie, both of whom had been hired as policemen during the elections. The two men began arguing on August 11, 1871, over local politics on election day in the \\"Red Front Saloon\\", located in downtown Newton. The argument developed into a fist fight, with Bailey being knocked outside the saloon and into the street. McCluskie followed, drawing his pistol. He fired two shots at Bailey, hitting him with the second shot in the chest. Bailey died the next day, on August 12, 1871. McCluskie fled town to avoid arrest, but was only away for a few days before returning, after receiving information that the shooting would most likely be deemed self defense, despite the fact that Bailey never produced a weapon. McCluskie had claimed he feared for his life, having known that in three previous gunfights, Bailey had killed two men. Bailey, a native of Texas, had several cowboy friends who were in town. Upon hearing of his death, they vowed revenge against McCluskie. On August 19, 1871, McCluskie entered Newton and went to gamble at \\"Tuttles Dance Hall\\", located in an area of town called Hide Park. He was accompanied by a friend, Jim Martin. As McCluskie settled into gambling, three cowboys entered the saloon. They were Billy Garrett, Henry Kearnes, and Jim Wilkerson, all friends to Bailey. Billy Garrett had been in at least two prior gunfights, killing two men. Hugh Anderson, the son of a wealthy Bell County, Texas cattle rancher, also entered, and approached McCluskie, calling him a coward and threatening his life. Jim Martin jumped up and attempted to stop a fight from occurring. Anderson shot McCluskie in the neck, knocking him to the floor. McCluskie attempted to shoot Anderson, but his pistol misfired. Anderson then stood over him and shot him several times in the back. Kearns, Garrett, and Wilkerson also began firing, perhaps to keep the crowd back, and may have shot McCluskie in the leg. At that point James Riley, believed to have been 18 years of age at the time, opened fire on them. Riley was thought to be dying from tuberculosis (this is not a fact), and had been taken in by McCluskie shortly after arriving in Newton. Riley had never been involved in a gunfight before, but only Anderson still had a loaded pistol to return fire. Some accounts say Riley locked the saloon doors before shooting, but this seems unlikely. The room was filled with smoke from all the prior gunfire, and visibility was bad. Riley ended up hitting seven men. Jim Martin, the would-be peacemaker, was shot in the neck and later died of his wound. Garrett, Kearns, and a bystander named Patrick Lee were also mortally wounded. Anderson, Wilkerson, and another bystander were wounded but survived. With both guns empty and all his opponents down, Riley walked away and was never seen again. A warrant was issued for Anderson for killing McCluskie. He left Kansas by train and settled in Texas to recover from his wounds. On July 4, 1873, McCluskie's brother, Arthur McCluskie, located Anderson. A brutal fight ensued with both men shooting each other several times, then going after each other with knives. Neither survived. Riley has been listed as a gunfighter in some historical accounts. He was mentioned in The Gunfighter-Man or Myth, by Joseph G. Rosa. However, there are no indications that he was ever in any other gunfights short of this one. Some believe Riley died soon after from his poor health. But the legend has it that Riley was not dying. He was explained in writings from the time as being gaunt, emaciated, and scarecrow like, with no mention of a sickness causing these things. Now many jump to thinking he was dying because of those descriptions but he could have just been a thin, frail looking young man. It is said that he moved East across the Mississippi River where he settled at a plantation. Either way, he disappeared from historical record.

The service is currently unavailable. In August 2010, Intertrust Technologies announced that it had acquired all software and patents developed by SeeqPod, Inc. via the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding. Intertrust did not acquire the domain names used by the company. History SeeqPod's search and recommendation technology is anchored by a biomimetic algorithm originally developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab under the name GenoPharm. GenoPharm‚Äôs unique algorithm mimics the way a biologist searches through biomedical literature for connections between genes. The system, meant to serve as an add-on to a biologists brain, has allowed researches to find indirect connections between genes and therapies that had never been noticed before. This expedited the research process, allowing biologists to do in minutes what normally would have taken days. The unique ability to understand complex, hidden relationships between genes and diseases was soon applied to playable media content on the internet under the name SeeqPod. Since SeeqPod is powered by the GenoPharm algorithm, the engine solves search queries by linking relevant information automatically from each analyzed source of information, creating connections similar to how the human brain might. This is in contrast to the traditional search engines, which rely mostly on familiar keyword associations. R&D; Magazine recognized the development of SeeqPod's search technology by naming it the winner of the 2008 R&D; 100 Award in Software, dubbed the 'Oscars of Innovation' by The Chicago Tribune. A number of record companies have attempted to sue SeeqPod, including Warner Music Group, Elektra Records, Rhino Records, and most recently EMI and Capitol Records. In addition, a multibillion-dollar lawsuit was filed by EMI and Capitol Records against Kasian Franks as the founder of SeeqPod. However, the suit from EMI and Capitol Records was thrown out of court. Due to economic conditions and litigation, SeeqPod filed for bankruptcy protection on April 1, 2009. Around this time, the company looked at changing its business model by potentially licensing its technology to third-party developers. Some speculated that SeeqPod had been purchased by Microsoft or that the company has licensed SeeqPod's software. , the SeeqPod service is unavailable, it no longer redirects to another website.

Warner Music Group alleges that SeeqPod is liable for copyright infringement by linking to sites containing unauthorized and illegal copies of copyrighted music. The complaint points to SeeqPod‚Äôs ability to search for a particular type of content ‚Äì music ‚Äì that is copyrighted. SeeqPod is claiming safe harbor under Title II of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (\\"OCILLA\\"), which creates a safe harbor for online service providers (OSPs, including ISPs) against copyright liability if they adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to allegedly infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) if they receive a notification claiming infringement from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. In February 2009, Capitol Records and EMI filed a complaint against SeeqPod and its search engine technology. While similar cases have been filed against YouTube, MP3Tunes.com, Veoh, PornoTube, and Divx/Stage 6, this case is particularly important as it directly tests how copyright law applies to search engines.

Philadelphia during the American Civil War was an important source of troops, money, weapons, medical care, and supplies for the Union. Before the Civil War, Philadelphia's economic connections with the South made much of the city sympathetic to South's grievances with the North. Once the war began, many Philadelphians' opinion shifted in support for the Union and the war against the Confederate States. More than 50 infantry and cavalry regiments were recruited fully or partly in Philadelphia. The city, the main source for uniforms for the Union Army, also manufactured weapons and built warships. Philadelphia also had the two largest military hospitals in the United States: Satterlee Hospital and Mower Hospital. In 1863, Philadelphia was threatened by Confederate invasion during the Gettysburg Campaign. Entrenchments were built to defend the city, but the Confederate Army was turned back at Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, and at the Battle of Gettysburg. The Civil War's main legacy in Philadelphia was the rise of the Republican Party. Despised before the war because of its anti-slavery position, the party created a political machine that would dominate Philadelphia politics for almost a century. Prewar Antebellum Philadelphia was the second-largest city in the United States. Its strong economic ties with to the South fostered political sympathy; for example, political leaders in the city called for the repeal of laws that might be considered unfriendly to South. Meetings led to calls for Pennsylvania to decide which side the state was on in the case of Southern secession. Many blamed the Abolitionist movement for the crisis, and Abolitionists in the city were harassed and threatened. In the 1860 mayoral election, the Democratic Party candidate John Robbins challenged the People's Party candidate and incumbent mayor, Alexander Henry. The People's Party in Pennsylvania was aligned with the national Republican Party but downplayed the issue of slavery and made tariff protection its main issue in the state. During the election, the Democrat attacked Henry's moderate position on slavery as virtual Sbolitionism. He was reelected, but vote tampering was alleged. In the election for governor, Philadelphia gave the Democrats 51 percent of the vote, and in the presidential election, the Republicans' Abraham Lincoln won 52 percent of the city's vote. After the election, Philadelphia City Council voted to invite Lincoln to speak in the city with only one dissenting vote. He accepted and spoke twice, once at the Continental Hotel and once at the Pennsylvania State House. His speech marked a turning point in attitude for much of the Philadelphia elite. Civil War After the American Civil War officially began with the attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina, popular opinion in Philadelphia shifted. American flags and bunting appeared all over the city as Philadelphians moved their anger from Abolitionists to southern sympathizers. A mob threatened the home of the Palmetto Flag, a secessionist newspaper. The police and Mayor Henry were able to prevent the mob from causing damage, but the newspaper shut down shortly afterward. Other newspapers that had a pro-southern slant also suffered from a dwindling circulation.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 384, 394 When The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the Union lost the First Battle of Bull Run, which contradicted initial government reports, a mob threatened to burn down its office. Another personal appearance by Mayor Henry prevented a riot at the home of the prominent Democrat and grandson of Joseph Reed, William B. Reed. Other people with suspected pro-southern ties displayed American flags to avoid trouble. The initial enthusiasm at the beginning of the war soon diminished, but critics were still targeted. Around August 1861, federal authorities arrested eight people for expressing Confederate sympathies. Most of the people were released soon afterward, but one, the son of William H. Winder, was held for more than a year. Authorities also shut down a pro- southern weekly newspaper, the Christian Observer.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, p. 403 In 1862, after expressing antiwar sentiments, former Democratic Representative Charles Jared Ingersoll was arrested for discouraging enlistments. The arrest of the well-respected politician caused local Republicans embarrassment, and he was released after direct orders from the federal government.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, p. 405 The city's Democrats used Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus and his Emancipation Proclamation as ammunition against Republicans. However, many in Philadelphia agreed with The Philadelphia Inquirer, which claimed in a July 1862 article that \\"in this war there can be but two parties, patriots and traitors.\\" Democrats did poorly in the 1862 election with Democratic Representative Charles John Biddle losing to Charles O'Neill, leaving only one Democrat from Philadelphia in the US House of Representatives. Samuel J. Randall, the only Democrat from Philadelphia in the House, was closer to Republicans than his own party.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, p. 413 Henry, running on the National Union Party ticket, was elected to a third term as Philadelphia mayor. =Invasion threat= In June 1863, General Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in the Gettysburg Campaign. As word reached Philadelphia that the Confederate Army was marching on Harrisburg some 100 miles to the west, Philadelphians felt no urgency to prepare the city to defend itself. On June 26, Major-General Napoleon Jackson Tecumseh Dana took command of the military district of Philadelphia and began to build defensive entrenchments, with the help of volunteers recruited by Mayor Henry. At the beginning of July, Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin came to the city in the hope to rally the city out of its lack of urgency.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 408‚Äì410 Philadelphia's Twentieth Pennsylvania Emergency Regiment and its First City Troop were among the militia that helped prevent the Confederate forces from crossing the Susquehanna River at Wrightsville by burning the Columbia-Wrightsville Bridge. The threat of invasion ended on July 3, when Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was defeated by the Army of the Potomac, commanded by George Meade, in the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. =After Gettysburg= After the Gettysburg Campaign, support for the war grew, and hopes for antiwar elements to make headway in the city diminished. After the victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, patriotic feelings grew, more people enlisted in the army, and Philadelphia voted for the re-election of Republican Governor Curtin over the Peace Democrat George Washington Woodward. In July 1863 the draft began to be enforced in the city. Mayor Henry and General George Cadwalader, who replaced Major-General Dana as the commander of Philadelphia military district, quietly suppressed any disturbances to prevent riots similar to the fraft riots in New York City.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 411‚Äì412 Logan Square, Philadelphia, June 1864. In June 1864, the Philadelphia division of the United States Sanitary Commission organized a large fair to raise money to buy bandages and medicine. The Great Central Fair lasted two weeks and was held in temporary buildings covering several acres of Logan Square. Thousands of works of art were lent for display, and many were donated for auction. Among the visitors was Lincoln. The Sanitary Fair raised $1,046,859.Frank H. Taylor, Philadelphia in the Civil War (Philadelphia: Dunlap Printing Co., 1913), p. 264. In the 1864 election, most Philadelphians voted to re-elect Lincoln and the four representatives from Philadelphia. The National Union Party also gained majority in both houses of the Philadelphia City Council. In December 1864, Philadelphia's streetcar companies began either allowing African Americans on the streetcars or running streetcars specifically for African Americans. The companies capitulated after African Americans and others put pressure on the companies because African American soldiers were reporting late for duty and soldiers' wives experienced trouble visiting their wounded husbands in the hospitals. The city's streetcars were not fully integrated until 1867, when they were required by a law passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 415‚Äì416 Military contribution Volunteer Refreshment Saloon, created to provide refreshments to soldiers arriving in Philadelphia. Many soldiers from New England and New Jersey came through Philadelphia while they were heading south.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 395‚Äì396 Many soldiers moved through New Jersey via the Camden and Amboy Railroad and then the Delaware River by ferry. The ferry would drop them off at Washington Avenue, where they would march to waiting trains of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. Local residents formed two organizations, the Union Volunteer Refreshment Saloon and the Cooper Shop Refreshment Saloon, to greet the arriving soldiers with refreshments and letter-writing materials.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, pp. 398‚Äì399 Washington Grays Monument by John A. Wilson The first Philadelphia regiment sent out of the city was a volunteer formation, the Washington Grays, which was dispatched to help defend Washington, DC. The unit made it to Baltimore, Maryland, where it was attacked by a secessionist mob in the Baltimore riot of 1861. The brigade retreated to Philadelphia, where George Leisenring, a German-born private, died and became Philadelphia's first war casualty. The first Philadelphians to encounter Confederate forces were the Twenty-third Infantry Regiment and the First City Troop at the Battle of Hoke's Run in West Virginia. More than 50 infantry and cavalry regiments were eventually recruited fully or partly in Philadelphia. They included the Philadelphia Brigade and the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry, recruited and sponsored by the Philadelphia Corn Exchange. In addition, 11 United States Colored Troops were organized in Philadelphia. During the war, between 89,000 and 90,000 Philadelphians were on enlistment rolls. The number includes re-enlistments but not African American soldiers from Philadelphia, whose enlistment numbers are unknown. Philadelphia's Schuylkill Arsenal was the US Army's main source for uniforms. Hundreds of workers in Philadelphia made parts of the uniforms in their homes to be assembled at the arsenal. The Frankford Arsenal manufactured munitions and the Sharp and Rankin's factory- made breech-loading rifles. The Philadelphia Navy Yard, employing 3,000 people, built 11 warships and outfitted many more. Philadelphia's private shipyards, including William Cramp & Sons, also constructed many ships, such as the USS New Ironsides. Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, 1863 Over the course of the war, Philadelphia was the site of 24 military hospitals. Philadelphia had as many as 10,000 beds for soldiers, not including the beds in the 22 civilian hospitals, which sometimes cared for soldiers. The Union Refreshment Saloon created the first military hospital in the city. Its hospital had 15 beds for sick soldiers passing through the city. Smaller hospitals, such as the Haddington Hospital and the Citizens' Volunteer Hospital both with 400 beds, were among the earliest to be set up. They were eventually closed to allow more focus on Philadelphia's largest military hospitals. The hospitals, the largest military hospitals in the United States, were Satterlee Hospital with 3,124 beds and Mower Hospital with 4,000 beds. In total, around 157,000 soldiers and sailors were treated in Philadelphia hospitals.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, page 402 Legacy Union League of Philadelphia. The Civil War led to decades of dominance by the Republican Party in the city's politics. Antebellum Republicans had held little support in the city, mainly because of the party's anti-slavery position. However, the Democrats' opposition to the war transferred so much popular support to Republicans during and after the war that it allowed the creation of a powerful and eventually-corrupt political machine, which would dominate city politics for almost a century. In 1861, a group of prominent Philadelphians founded the Union Club in response to pro-southern support in another social club, the Wistar Club. The Union Club became the Union League in 1863 and abolished its membership limit of 50. With 1,000 members by the end of the war, the Union League became a center of Republican politics and still exists as one of Philadelphia's largest and most prestigious social clubs.Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, p. 407A Concise History of Philadelphia, p. 60 The Civil War also helped create some of Philadelphia's upper class. The Philadelphia banker Jay Cooke made a fortune selling Union war bonds worth roughly $1 billion. The future streetcar magnate Peter Widener amassed his initial wealth by supplying meat to the Union Army; John and James Dobson made their fortune manufacturing blankets.A Concise History of Philadelphia, page 61 =Memorials= Smith Memorial Arch, West Fairmount Park, Philadelphia (1898-1912). The Civil War Library and Museum, now the Civil War Museum of Philadelphia, was founded in 1888. The oldest chartered American Civil War institution, the Civil War and Underground Railroad Museum of Philadelphia, was founded by the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States; it collects records, artifacts, and other items related to the Civil War and the Underground Railroad . On the Benjamin Franklin Parkway is the Civil War Soldiers and Sailors Memorial. Designed by Hermon Atkins MacNeil and completed in 1927, the memorial comprises two pylons sitting on each side of the parkway. Across 20th Street, is the All Wars Memorial to Colored Soldiers and Sailors (1934) by J. Otto Schweizer. Originally erected in West Fairmount Park, it was moved to Logan Circle in 1994.All Wars Memorial Philadelphia's largest Civil War monument is the Smith Memorial Arch, built on the former grounds of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in West Fairmount Park. Designed by James H. Windrim, and completed in 1912, it includes sculptures by Herbert Adams, George Bissell, Alexander Stirling Calder, Daniel Chester French, Charles Grafly, Samuel Murray, Edward Clark Potter, John Massey Rhind, Bessie Potter Vonnoh, and John Quincy Adams Ward.Smith Memorial Arch from Philadelphia Public Art. Notable people from Philadelphia Major General George G. Meade. The Philadelphia area was the birthplace or long-time residence of several Union army generals and naval admirals. The city's most celebrated war hero was Major General George G. Meade (1815-1872), whose fame in the city came from his success at the Battle of Gettysburg and as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Philadelphia celebrated returning war heroes and Civil War veterans with parades. On June 10, 1865 the city held a grand review, with Meade leading veteran soldiers through the city in to a dinner at a volunteer refreshment saloon. Another grand review of Civil War veterans was held as part of the Independence Day celebration in 1866. The parade was led by another Philadelphian war hero, Winfield Scott Hancock (1824‚Äì1886).Philadelphia: A 300-Year History, p. 418 Others generals from Philadelphia included the filloy: *George B. McClellan (1826‚Äì1885) *Andrew A. Humphreys (1810‚Äì1883) *David B. Birney (1825‚Äì1864) *John Gibbon (1827‚Äì1896) *George A.

Twin hose regulators  Draeger twin hose two stage demand regulator The most striking and well recognized example of vintage scuba gear is the twin-hose or double hose regulator, a popular style of regulator in the early years of scuba diving, since Jacques- Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan pioneered the first such design, the C45 Scaphandre Autonome, which was marketed in the USA (along with a tank and harness) as the Aqua-Lung. The durability of the regulators from the 1950s through the early 1970s lent them to easily be refurbished and restored. Since 2007, Vintage Double Hose, in Wesley Chapel, Florida, has been manufacturing parts for original regulators as well as a modern version of the double-hose scuba regulator. The regulator is composed of modern polymers and specialty metals. It allows for additional scuba equipment to be attached, such as a submersible pressure gauge, which overcomes one of the problems of the original double hose regulators which were not able to incorporate accessories.  Regulator features of historical interest  =First stage with integral reserve valve= 1960 Sportsways Waterlung \\"Navy unit\\" with integrated reserve valve and lever on the first stage A number of manufacturers produced integral reserve regulators in 1961 and 1962 with reasonable market acceptance. These regulators provided a lever operated mechanical reserve valve that restricted air flow when the pressure was below 500 psi. Alerted to having a low gas supply the diver would pull a rod to open the reserve valve and surface using the remaining gas. This feature provides reserve capacity on cylinders with plain valves. With this arrangement the reserve rod must also be transferred to the cylinder in use. =Twin-hose with regulator on chest= In this unusual configuration the cylinder(s) are on the diver's back and are connected by a low pressure hose to a twin-hose regulator on the diver's chest. A design described in Practical Mechanics magazine in January 1955 as a home-made aqualung with a first-stage on the cylinder top leading through a low pressure hose to a large round second-stage (a converted Calor Gas regulator) on the diver's chest connected to the diver's mouthpiece by a twin-hose loop. * An early Australian design called a Lawson Lung was made in Sydney by a group of enthusiasts who were unable to get Aqua-lungs due to limited supply, based on the patented Costeau-Gagnan design, but modified to use available components. The regulators were made and tested at John Lawson‚Äôs jewellery factory in Greenwich, North Sydney. Only 12 were made, and had to be mounted on the chest to achieve acceptable performance. =Full-face mask regulator= diagram of the 1946 version of the Le Prieur breathing set There have been some cases of a single-hose regulator final stage built into a full-face mask so that the mask's big front window, in conjunction with a flexible rubber seal joining it to its frame, functioned as a large and sensitive regulator diaphragm: *Several versions of the Le Prieur breathing set. Yves Le Prieur first patented with Maurice Fernez, in 1926, a breathing apparatus using a mouthpiece, but as of 1933 he removed the mouthpiece and included a circular full-face mask in all following patents (like 1937, 1946 or 1947). * In 1934 Ren√© Commeinhes, from Alsace (France), adapted a Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus for the use of firefighters. With new 1937 and 1942 patents (GC37 and GC42), his son Georges adapted this invention to underwater breathing by means of a single hose connected to a full-face mask. *Captain Trevor Hampton invented independently from Le Prieur a similar regulator-mask in the 1950s and submitted it for patent. The Royal Navy requisitioned the patent, but found no use for it and eventually released it. By then, the technology had advanced and it was too late to make this regulator-mask in bulk for sale.  Regulator models of historical interest  =Ohgushi's Peerless Respirator= Invented in 1916 by Riichi Watanabi and the blacksmith Kinzo Ohgushi, and used with either surface supplied air or a 150 bar steel scuba cylinder holding 1000 litres free air, the valve supplied air to a mask over the diver's nose and eyes and the demand valve was operated by the diver's teeth. Gas flow rate was proportional to bite force. The breathing apparatus was used successfully for fishing and salvage work and by the military Japanese Underwater Unit until the end of the Pacific War. =Demone regulator= These unusual regulators were designed by Robert J. Dempster and made at his factory in Illinois, USA, from 1961 to 1965. The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both two-stage regulators. The second- stage looks like the mouthpiece of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside the mouthpiece tube. The exhaled air goes into a corrugated coaxial exhaust hose which surrounds the low pressure hose and discharges about 60% of the way back to the first- stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face. Near the mouthpiece is a one-way valve to let outside water into the exhaust hose to avoid free flow if the diaphragm (at the mouth) is below the open end of the exhaust hose. The Mark I has hoses only on one side, and the Mark II has twinned low pressure hoses, each with its own coaxial exhaust hose and second stage, one assembly on each side of the diver's head, but with both second stages in the same mouthpiece housing and operated by the same diaphragm. This version has a small second stage. =Normalair breathing apparatus= This system is unusual in that it used a single stage single hose demand valve in a full-face mask. The high pressure supply hose routes over the shoulder, but from an inverted cylinder, which allows the user to easily reach the valve. =Dr√§ger Delfin II (Barakuda)= For a few years in the mid-1950s, Dr√§ger made the Dr√§ger Delfin II (their first scuba regulator - it was marketed as the Barakuda (now IAC) in the USA): this was a single stage single hose \\"pendulum\\"\\" regulator with only one ambient pressure (corrugated) hose: the exhaled air went back down the hose to the cylinder mounted regulator and was released to outside through a one-way valve inside the casing. The end of the flexible tube was connected to the mouthpiece by a short quarter-circle of hard tube. The two way hose would have caused dead space similar to a rebreather with a pendulum system. = Porpoise regulator = An example of the Porpoise CA-1, the world's first commercially available, single hose SCUBA unit The first single-hose open- circuit scuba made by Ted Eldred in Melbourne, Australia. It was designed in 1948 to avoid the Cousteau-Gagnan aqua-lung patent, and to get rid of air supply restrictions that affected early Cousteau-Gagnan-type aqua-lungs. Commercial production started in 1952. The Royal Australian Navy adopted it, and it popular with Australian recreational scuba divers. The model CA-1 was used on one cylinder with its valve at the bottom, strapped directly to the back with rucksack-type straps without backpack plate or buoyancy aid, with a single-hose regulator-mouthpiece which could be strapped in. The tank was inverted so that the diver could reach the regulator mounted reserve handle. The head strap was intended to keep the demand valve from falling well below the diver, if dropped from the mouth. The high-pressure regulator screwed into the outlet of the cylinder valve. Versions were made for the Australian Navy until 1976, and the last one known to be sold to the public was sold in that year. About 12,000 Porpoise units of all models were produced, of which about 50 still exist. Only a few of the early models are known today, the rarest being the CA-2, made for use with two tanks. \\"Tadpoles\\" In the early years of scuba diving in Britain, \\"tadpole\\" was a nickname for a type of diving gear that had two meanings: * A type of ex-Royal Air Force pilot's oxygen cylinder that had a tapering end, and was often used as an aqualung cylinder in the 1960s and earlier. * An early make of Siebe Gorman aqualung with a twin-hose regulator and two air cylinders. Both ends were hemispherical, and were 13 inches long and 7 inches in diameter. Siebe Gorman's trade catalog describing this set showed two sorts of diver wearing this set, both with weighted boots, and with no mention of free-swimming. A 1950s Royal Navy diving manual also said that the Aqua-Lung was only for bottom-walking diving. Siebe Gorman either had no idea about sport diving then, or else was against sport diving, and expected aqualungs to be used for light commercial diving. Later most recreational divers were free-swimming scuba divers, with bottom-walkers virtually restricted to those doing commercial work.  Historical rebreathers  *Porpoise oxygen rebreather  Reserve valves  Detail of the Draeger reserve valve  Exotic and experimental equipment  =Propulsive power from the stored energy= The concept of a diving regulator where the energy released as the air expands from cylinder pressure to the surrounding pressure as the diver inhales, is used to power a propeller has been patented, but no product ever appeared on the market. =Twin-hose, home-made regulators= In 1956 and for some years afterwards in Britain, factory-made aqualungs were very expensive, and many aqualungs of this type were made by sport divers in diving clubs' workshops, using miscellaneous industrial and war-surplus parts. One necessary raw material was a Calor Gas bottled butane gas regulator, whose 1950s version was like an aqualung regulator's second stage but passed gas all the time because its diaphragm was spring-loaded; conversion included changing the spring and making several big holes in the wet-side casing. The cylinder was often an ex-RAF pilot's oxygen cylinder; some of these cylinders were called tadpoles from their shape. =Practical Mechanics design= A design was described in Practical Mechanics magazine in January 1955, for a home-made aqualung with a first-stage on the cylinder top leading through a low pressure hose to a converted Calor Gas regulator on the diver's chest connected to the diver's mouthpiece by a twin-hose loop.

She was portrayed by Merrin Dungey in the backdoor pilot Grey's Anatomy episode, \\"The Other Side of This Life\\", but was replaced by Audra McDonald prior to the show's first season. Naomi is a fertility specialist and founding partner of the Oceanside Wellness Center in Los Angeles, where the series is set. She is the best friend of central character Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), and was married to the practice's internist Sam (Taye Diggs), with whom she has a daughter. She left Private Practice at the end of the fourth season, but returned for the series finale. Storylines Naomi is a founding partner of the Oceanside Wellness Center in Los Angeles, California, where she works as a fertility specialist, board- certified in reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics and gynecology. She attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and is a member of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She works alongside her health guru ex- husband, Sam (Taye Diggs) who divorced her prior to the beginning of the series. Together they have a teenage daughter named Maya (Geffri Maya Hightower), whose godmother is Naomi's best friend from medical school, Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh). Addison seeks medical advice from Naomi as she wants to get pregnant. After running some tests, Naomi concludes that Addison is unable to have children because her antral follicle count is two. Naomi's relationship with Sam is relatively amicable but often strained. The reasons for their divorce are relatively unclear, with Sam saying he was \\"unhappy\\", but also that he had \\"no good reason\\" for asking for a divorce, with Naomi seemingly resentful of this. However, in \\"In Which Sam Gets Taken For A Ride\\", the two have sex in the conference room at the practice, after Sam is involved in a hostage situation. Naomi later calls this incident a \\"slip-up\\" but the two have sex again in the episode \\"In Which Cooper Finds a Port in His Storm\\". Dell, the office receptionist, has a crush on Naomi, and often shows it by getting her coffee, bringing her home-baked chocolate cake and generally complimenting and adoring her. Naomi doesn't take his crush too seriously, calling him a \\"child\\". In \\"Down the Rabbit Hole,\\" Naomi has her first date since college, which doesn't go that well because all she can talk about is her job. For a short time, she also dates Addison's brother, Archer Montgomery (Grant Show). In \\"Another Second Chance\\" and then later in \\"Best Laid Plans\\" it is revealed that her daughter Maya is pregnant. Naomi is at first unable to deal with this, and walks out on her daughter, leaving Sam to deal with it. Later she storms back and even slaps her when Maya refuses to have an abortion. Violet and Addison are worried about her, as Naomi was always very much against abortion, but Maya finally agrees to have it. When Addison is about to perform the abortion Maya changes her mind, which further upsets Naomi. In \\"Love and Lies\\" in a heated argument with Sam, Addison, and Fife, she states that the practice is not the same as when she started it and said that she didn't want to stay a part of it anymore. This comes as quite a shock to them. She also dumps Fife. This scene gives us an insight as to how she is leaving the show. After Betsey's foster brother is revealed to have been abusing her, her foster parents abandon her at the hospital to focus on their son. Naomi decides to take Betsey home with her forever. At the end of the Season Four finale, Naomi chases Fife to the airport and says goodbye to Addison. Fife proposes to Naomi and she says yes but also says they are moving to New York so she, Fife, and Betsey can live nice normal lives. This is the last time Naomi appears as a series regular in the show, although she does return for the season six finale which is also the series finale. Development Naomi was created by Shonda Rhimes, who wanted the show's central character Addison to have a close friend from her college days. The character is based on a friend of Rhimes', who \\"married her college sweetheart and is strong and smart and funny.\\" Naomi was played by Merrin Dungey in the backdoor pilot episode \\"The Other Side of This Life\\", but was replaced by Audra McDonald prior to the show's first season. Rhimes explained that the production team \\"wanted to put an edge on Naomi that we could define more clearly.\\" McDonald assessed that Dungey's dismissal was hard as a result of its having been so public, but commented that she herself had once been similarly replaced, having played Bill Cosby's daughter in the pilot episode of Cosby, only to be replaced thereafter. Reception Discussing the first episode of the show following the pilot, Variety's Cynthia Littleton observed: \\"I can definitely see why creator/exec producer Shonda Rhimes made the call to recast Audra McDonald in the key role of Naomi Bennett\\". Fellow Variety critic Brian Lowry was more negative in his consideration of the episode, noting that Naomi and Sam's \\"'No, you left me first' interaction already feels tedious.\\" Jon Caramanica of the Los Angeles Times has criticized McDonald's performance as Naomi in the show's first season, writing that: \\"she was rigorously firm, almost dispassionate. As people bed-hopped and were emotionally flimsy around her, she remained stern at the center [...] McDonald is a strong, vivid actress, but such gravity felt at odds with the breezy tone of Private Practice.\\" Caramancia opined that \\"the tougher Naomi became, the lighter Addison had to be to keep the show's balance\\", and that as a result the series \\"regularly felt unmoored and became something of a critical punching bag\\". He was much more positive regarding her performance in the second season premiere episode \\"A Family Thing\\", observing: \\"Toward the end of the episode, there is a brief scene in which she, beleaguered and on her last leg, utterly melts into Sam. In those 15 seconds, McDonald's genius as an actress is clear, communicating with just a few facial movements and shading of the eyes a world of hurt and letdown. [...] And later in the episode, when she thinks things are falling back into place, her soft, knowing, warm smile is one of the show's greatest victories, even though it comes just before everything goes wrong once again.\\" References External links *Naomi Bennett at ABC.com Category:Fictional physicians Category:Private Practice (TV series) characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Television characters introduced in 2006 Category:Fictional female doctors Category:American female characters in television ","title":"Naomi Bennett"},{"id":"12240639","text":"Desert Demolition Starring Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote is a platform video game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. The game was released in North America on February 1995 and in Europe the following month. The game is based around Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, who are the game's player characters and are tasked with playing through a series of levels as they respectively pursue and evade the other. The game was re-released as part of the Sega Mega Hits range on September 1997. Gameplay Desert Demolition is a platform game in which the player can choose to control either the Road Runner or Wile E. Coyote for the game's duration. As either character, the player must traverse through a series of five levels and a final boss stage; the Road Runner must do so while evading Wile E., while Wile E. can repeatedly capture the Road Runner with the aid of special ACME gadgets. The Road Runner has the ability to use his signature beeping vocalization to startle Wile E. if he is positioned behind him, while Wile E. can pounce in an effort to capture the Road Runner. Both characters can run in a short burst of speed by using \\"Turbo Boost\\" icons scattered within the levels. As either character, the player is given a limited amount of health that is displayed as a red bar on the upper-left side of the screen and is depleted by taking damage from traps and hazards or, as the Road Runner, coming into contact with Wile E.. The player also has a limited amount of time to complete each level, which is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The player will lose a life if the health bar is fully depleted or if the allotted time runs out. Health can be replenished by consuming piles of bird seed as the Road Runner or by consuming jars of vitamin pills as Wile E., and extra time can be added to the timer by collecting clocks. If the number of lives in stock is completely exhausted, the game ends prematurely. Extra lives can be obtained by collecting icons in the shape of the Road Runner's or Wile E.'s head. Each level is divided into two acts, and littered throughout the levels are stamps that can be collected. Wile E. can collect a series of stamps with each successful capture of the Road Runner, while the Road Runner can collect extra stamps by startling Wile E. with a vocalization from behind, trampling him with a Turbo Boost or luring him into obstacles and traps. If a minimum of 125 stamps are collected within a level, a bonus stage will be initiated at the conclusion of the given level's second act. These stages can be used to stockpile Turbo Boosts and lives, and will end when the player reaches the end of the stage or if the allotted time runs out. ACME-labeled crates can be found throughout each level. As Wile E., the player can enter a crate and emerge using one of various contraptions that will often augment Wile E.'s movement and aid in the capture of the Road Runner. As the Road Runner, the crates should be avoided as Wile E. will ambush the Road Runner using the same contraptions if the crate's vicinity is approached. =Endings= Completing the game results in two different endings for each character, both of which feature cameo appearances by Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Elmer Fudd (all of whom are working as employees of ACME Corporation). If playing as the Road Runner, a banner will come down from the ceiling that states: \\"Congratulations! ACME President\\", indicating the Road Runner has been named the President, leading Wile E. to panic and crash through the glass window behind him, leaving his silhouette in the window. If playing as Wile E., the banner says, \\"Congratulations! ACME Customer of the Year\\", Bugs presents Wile E. with a trophy that goes with the award, and the others clap for him as the Road Runner says his trademark \\"Beep, beep!\\" and leaves, leaving the Coyote in shock. Balloons and streams fall from the ceiling. Reception GamePro called the game \\"a lightweight frolic\\", commenting that playing as the Road Runner is one-dimensional and overly easy, but playing as Wile E. Coyote offers a varied gameplay experience with humorous animations. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 6.75 out of 10 but unanimously panned the game, saying that the graphics and animation are outstanding but that poor control makes the game frustrating and unenjoyable. A reviewer for Next Generation gave the game three out of five stars, saying it \\"captures the humor and feel of the Warner Brothers' classic like no other game.\\" He praised the animation and sound effects, and echoed GamePros remarks that playing as Wile E. Coyote is a much more varied and enjoyable experience than playing as the Road Runner. He concluded that only the game's short length and low difficulty make it one to rent rather than one to buy.

An extended version of the game with an additional campaign, Eurofighter Typhoon: Operation Icebreaker, was released in 2002. Gameplay The story of the game posits Russia quickly invading the eastern countries of Europe. Iceland is the next one on the list, as NATO has abandoned the country in an attempt to protect the Western countries of Europe.

The game also features a very extensive virtual battleground over Iceland, some of the most advanced created at the time. A dynamic camera enables watch the war in real-time. As the war unfolds, news will be delivered by an online newspaper. The game allows the player to take over the destiny of six pilots. Each one will be assigned different missions depending on their abilities such as bombing, interception, Wild Weasel, with several of these missions even going on at the same time. The player can switch at any time between pilots, taking charge of the most critical and dangerous tasks of the mission, and leaving up to the AI the others.

The Bedridden reunited for a series of concerts in 2005 to promote a live album that was recorded in 1998. The band were noted for regular break-ups and constant line-up changes. Song- writing and lead-vocal duties were shared amongst the members of the band, creating a somewhat eclectic style and an evolving sound due to the departure of key members. They created a strong fan base around the Australian pub rock scene, especially in Adelaide which was considered to be the home of the band.  History  The group formed in 1989 in Canberra and quickly moved to Adelaide where the band remained until Baterz's death in 2002. The original members were Baterz (guitar), David M. Lewis (guitar), Spaemen (Steven McKenzie) (bass guitar), Kirsty Stegwazi (guitar) and Lillybub (William Heuzenroeder) (cello). The group recorded their first album It's All Fun And Games Until Someone Loses An Eye later in 1989 and it was eventually released through the Adelaide-based label Round Records in 1990. The album introduced some of the group's most well-remembered songs, including Bateman's Bay, Stephen McKenzie, and the Sesame Street tune Capital I. With the release of their first album, the band toured the Australian cities of Canberra, Sydney, and Melbourne, developing a stronger fan base. Their second album, Big Scary Cow, was released in 1992, again through Round Records. This second collection featured Bedridden favourites including 2/11/1968, Midget, and their second Sesame Street cover, Born To Add. Between 1993 and 1995, The Bedridden had their longest falling out. Some of the members pursued solo careers, most notably Baterz and Kirsty Stegwazi, and the band members were spread over several states within Australia. This was the longest period of inactivity from the group during Baterz's life. By 1996 founding band member Baterz had developed an important name for himself as a solo artist. He invested in equipment to set up his own recording studio and label called Army of Nerds and, with recording gear in place, brought back various group members to record the third album as a band, I Told You it Wouldn't Work in 1998. The album had a much cleaner and defined sound, with stronger arrangements than seen before. The tracks included Agent of Satan, Darren Williams, and their most-recognised song The Drowning of the Daddo Brothers. In various incarnations, which featured Baterz, Benjow, Dave Wiffler, Dave Lewis, Lillybub, and others, The Bedridden performed sporadic shows in Adelaide and Melbourne, perhaps every few months until late 2001. March 2002 saw the release of a new Bedridden single, Inland Sea, which was to herald a fourth album. The fourth album never materialised (although most of it eventually appeared as Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla in 2013), due to the tragic and untimely death of Baterz at age 33. Baterz was a haemophiliac and, as a young teen, was diagnosed with HIV which he had contracted via a contaminated blood transfusion. In 2002, his condition worsened and lesions were discovered in his brain, affecting his co-ordination and forcing him to give up performing. Baterz died in July 2002. Triple J, the national youth radio network, broadcast a tribute to Baterz and his music on their Artery program.Triple J, Artery, 1 August 2002 As Baterz was one of the main driving forces behind The Bedridden, the band stopped performing and the unfinished recordings were temporarily shelved. In 2005, a new incarnation of The Bedridden performed a series of shows in Adelaide, Ballarat, and Melbourne to launch a live recording of the band - The Anthem Of The Crown & Anchor, a collection of live recordings from performances in July 1998 in Ballarat and Melbourne. In 2013, a 31-song album of previously unreleased tracks was released by Army Of Nerds. Titled Gorilla Gorilla Gorilla, it featured songs from almost every era of the band's career, from 1989 to 2005. Incarnations =The 2005 incarnation= *David M.

Her performance style varies widely, performing with several ensembles in different genres and in short-run shows. She is perhaps best known for collaborations with avant- garde composer and musician John Rodgers, including their \\"sex-and-death- cabaret-rock\\" band Madam Bones Brothel which developed a cult following in Brisbane and Melbourne. Career Pearly began singing in Brisbane in the late 1980s where she met John Rodgers (sometimes known as John Bone) and created Madam Bones Brothel. She moved to Melbourne in the early 1990s (with John and other Brothel members) and worked extensively over the next 10 years in many diverse settings. Apart from performing solo and with Madam Bones Brothel, she was a member of acoustic prog-rock duo Diastima, Robin Casinader's folk-noir ensemble Hood, stadium-disco band Butt Funky, and the short-lived Latin/cabaret quartet Las Tangolitas. During her time in Melbourne, Pearly also sang with Petrunka (the Melbourne Women's Bulgarian Choir) and performed as a local cast member for dance troupe Stomp. In 1996, Pearly had a minor role in the film Love and Other Catastrophes as \\"Woman in Bathroom Making Love\\". In 2003, Pearly lived in Hobart and studied at the Conservatory of Music and with Maria Lurighi. She was a member of the Southern Gospel Choir.

At a young age he was heavily involved in classical music with orchestras, touring Europe and Asia, often appearing as a soloist. John chose not to follow a promising career in the classical field and Madam Bones Brothel, formed with Pearly, was a sharp rejection of all things represented in the highly controlled world of classical music. As a composer, John is highly regarded for his creative genius and a vast amount of this uniquely brilliant music has been written for Pearly to perform. The material in Madam Bones Brothel (composed by John) ranged from funk to rap, jazz to rock, country to flamenco, often in the same set. Madam Bones Brothel has not performed since 2000 but John and Pearly continue to play music together. John plays with Pearly in the gospel group Tell Heaven and they also play as a duo for special events (sometimes performing Madam Bones Brothel songs). John played in the Women in Voice band in 2004 when Pearly was a featured star and one of the songs she performed was The Ultimate Prize, a song previously recorded by The Brothel. In recent years, John has received several major grants to compose music for large shows and Pearly has often been included in the cast. Pearly sings the lead vocals in John's most recent large-scale musical theatre piece, The Dream Catchers.

History WAMATA was founded in June 1989 by a small group of Tanzanian professionals and families to assist individuals living with HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Theresa Kaijage led the organization while head of social work and family therapy at Muhimbili Medical Centre and as a lecturer at the Social Welfare Training Institute. She fundraised and secured voluntary help, eventually managing to obtain a small office space in the Catholic Brothers of Christian Institution. It was there that she began offering counsel and support to victims of HIV/AIDS through WAMATA. WAMATA was officially registered as a non-government organisation on 21 March 1990. In 1992 another branch was inaugurated in Rubya/Bukoba (western lakeside of Lake Victoria) for the Kagera Region. Another branch was inaugurated in Mwanza (southern lakeside of Lake Victoria) for the lake zone in the same year. The two branches are operating independently.

Early life Olga Havel was born in ≈Ωi≈ækov, \\"one of the roughest, working-class districts of Prague\\", in a working-class family. She spent her childhood in a way typical for such a harsh environment. Her parents split up when she was six years old. In a large family, also including Olga's older sister Jaroslava's family (a single mother of five children), any free hand was useful. Therefore, it was obvious that Olga cared for her young nieces and nephews since her childhood. As a child, she also attended Mil√≠ƒç≈Øv d≈Øm (Mil√≠ƒç House in Prague) established by P≈ôemysl Pitter. Olga used to spend a lot of time in libraries where she acquired her strong lifelong love of literature. Although her family's life was modest, Olga's mother used to take her children to cinema and theatre quite often. After graduating from secondary school, Olga became a trainee in the Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a factory, where she also worked afterwards. In the course of working on a sewing machine, she lost four fingers on her left hand. When she was about twenty, she was an enthusiastic theatre lover and attended the drama classes of Professor Lydie Wegener. Together with her other pupils, she acted in an amateur theatre performance in Divadlo Na slupi (which does not exist anymore). During the 1950s, she went through a number of different jobs. She worked, e.g., as an accountant, a store keeper, a sales assistant. Olga first met V√°clav Havel at the Prague writer's hangout Caf√© SlaviaKeane, pg. 141 in the early 1950s and married him in 1964. During the 1960s, her husband became a respected author both at home and in Europe. In the second half of the 1960s, he - as a writer and a contributor to the cultural magazines - was involved in a democratization process, particularly in the field of culture. He advocated freedom of speech, independence of culture, return of full- fledged civil rights. During the years 1961‚Äì67, Olga Havel worked at the theatre Divadlo Na z√°bradl√≠ (Theatre on the Balustrade) where her husband was also active until 1968. V√°clav Havel made no secret of the fact that, despite the diversity of personalities and family environment as well as all the usual problems of life and crises, Olga meant a lot for him. He appreciated how quickly this seemingly ordinary young woman from ≈Ωi≈ækov became a part of the Prague intellectual environment of the 1950s and '60s, that she was an attentive first reader and critic of his essays and dramatic works, a valuable supporter and collaborator in the difficult years of Charter 77 as well as a lifelong partner. In 1967, the Havels bought a country estate in the foothills called Hr√°deƒçek. Later on, when V√°clav Havel was gradually losing not only a possibility to find a job but also some contacts and friends in Prague, the couple moved to their cottage and practically lived there until November 1989. Olga Havel, a passionate mushroom-picker and nature-lover, fell in love with the place just like her husband. She was fond of gardening and taking her dogs for long walks to the forest. They alternated moments of peace and seclusion used by V√°clav for his work with a rich social life, of which they were hospitable organizers. As a Czechoslovak dissident Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 until the Velvet Revolution in 1989, V√°clav Havel could not publish openly in his home country, theatres were not allowed to stage his plays and he was gradually pushed out of the public cultural activities and became one of the most prominent dissidents. As a fighter against continuously intensified totalitarian regime, he was persecuted by the secret police (St√°tn√≠ bezpeƒçnost), he was often detained, interrogated and imprisoned. Olga Havel was always an important back up to her husband; she supported him in all his dissident activities and she was also involved in them. She was described as \\"full of forthright, even earthy common sense. A shrewd, intuitive judge of people, calm but tough, and with a natural dignity\\". After he was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment, Olga Havel together with her brother-in-law Ivan Havel took over responsibilities and obligations in samizdat Edition Expedition, which was led by V√°clav before. In relation to the prosecution for transporting prohibited printed material, she was accused of subversion of a republic in the case of \\"Karavan\\". Her prosecution was abolished after the fall of the Communist government. Olga Havel was the addressee of the intellectually deep, philosophically and existentially toned letters sent by V√°clav Havel during the years 1979 ‚Äì 1983 from prison. Some of them were intended not only to her but also to the philosophically minded circle of friends with whom he - through the letters - tried to think through different things and they tried to help him stay intellectually active. Letters to Olga, (Dopisy Olze) a selection of these letters, forms one of the most important books of V√°clav Havel, was first published in 1983 in the Edition Expedition. Olga also organized meetings, distributed manuscripts and participated in the Charter 77 activities. She signed Charter 77 in 1982. In the difficult years of insecurity, persecution and imprisonment of her husband, Olga fully and with joy used the opportunity to escape from the difficulties of everyday life by joining Hrobka (Tomb), the circle of friends organizing various humorous activities. V√°clav Havel characterized this circle accurately: \\"In the early 1980s, I was ‚Äì like several of my friends - imprisoned, conditions outside were harsh and so Hrobka was created as a way of self-defence; it was a cheerful community of imprisoned dissidents' wives, those who remained at large and their friends.\\" Olga soon became one of the organizers of a diverse range of cultural and social activities and thus she returned to her creative interests from the years of amateur theatre. She added to the community life not only as a regular hostess of costumed garden parties at Hr√°deƒçek on the occasion of her birthday but, first of all, she herself came up with many ideas and inspiration. In 1987, Olga co-founded Origin√°ln√≠ Videojournal, the samizdat video news magazine which documented the activities of dissent in pictures and informed about the present political and cultural situation in Czechoslovakia openly. She actively worked in the magazine and focused mainly on ecological topics. In late 1985, she initiated a magazine O divadle (About Theatre), and as a member of the editorial staff she helped mainly with economic and production issues. After November 1989 =Committee of Good Will ‚Äì Olga Havel Foundation= As the wife of the first Czechoslovak democratic president after February 1948, Olga Havel intensively focused on charitable activities. In the era of newly emerging democracy, she was a pioneer of charity in the country. In early 1990, she and her friends from Charter 77 founded the Committee of Good Will, one of the first projects of this kind in Czechoslovakia. In 1992, she founded the Olga Havel Foundation and members of the Committee of Good Will became Board Members of the foundation with Olga as the Chair. The main objective of the Committee of Good Will - Olga Havel Foundation (OHF) was to help people with disabilities, abandoned or discriminated against, with their integration into society. The Foundation activities soon became well known abroad. In some countries in Europe and overseas, sister organizations were established to support the main goals of the Foundation. Olga Havel visited emerging centres for children with multiple disabilities to inquire what could make their life easier. She was often seen among senior citizens and children with disabilities. She was interested in transformation of hospitals into non-profit, non-governmental organizations and urged ministers to support civil society organizations working in the social field. She earned respect of world politicians and cultural figures. She met outstanding personalities in and outside Europe; together with Christiane Herzog, wife of German President, she organized help for children with cystic fibrosis. =Olga Havel Award= On the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the OHF, Olga decided to present an award to a person with a disability who helped to improve living conditions of other disabled people. This prize is awarded annually in May. Olga attended just the first awards ceremony - she died in January 1996. The prize, a statue called Encouragement by Olbram Zoubek, thus also became a remembrance of a person who had always been an advocate for the rights of vulnerable citizens. One part of the Olga Havel Award project is to promote civic associations providing social and medical services in a dignified way, and using new forms of social services. For the OHF, the ceremony is also an opportunity to pay tribute to its significant donors and collaborators. =Last years and death= In 1991, Nordic foundation Stiftelsen Arets Budeje awarded Olga Havel with the prestigious prize Woman of the Year 1991. In 1995, Olga received the P≈ôemysl Pitter medal and became the Woman of the year 1995 in the Czech Republic. Olga Havel dedicated last years of her life to tireless building of civil society. In 1995, Olga was according to the public survey the most significant woman of the Czech Republic and she became an authority even abroad. Thanks to her the issue of handicapped people stopped to be an \\"indecent topic\\". Olga Havel died of cancer on 27 January 1996. Her death deeply hit the entire nation. People stood in a long queue to honour her, laid flowers in the chapel at the south wing of Prague Castle, and signed a condolence book. She is buried in the Havel family tomb at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery. In 1997, Olga Havel was in memoriam awarded the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk for outstanding contribution to democracy and human rights. Since 1996, based on approval of the President V√°clav Havel, secondary school in Ostrava-Poruba carries an honorary title ‚Äì Olga Havel Gymn√°zium. In 2014, Business Academy, specialized school and practical school in Jansk√© L√°znƒõ, which Olga Havel opened in 1994, was officially named after her. Olga Havel left neither letters nor a book of memories. Books by Pavel Kosat√≠k or Marta Markov√°, the tribute anthology S√≠la vƒõcnosti (Power of factuality) describe her life. In 1993, the documentary was made within the cycle GEN ‚Äì Galery of the nation's elite, in 2006 ‚Äì on the occasion of 10th anniversary of her death ‚Äì a documentary Pan√≠ Olga (Lady Olga) from the cycle P≈ô√≠bƒõhy slavn√Ωch (Stories of the famous). In 2014, director Miroslav Janek made the documentary OLGA, which was awarded in the category Best Documentary on the 22nd film awards ƒåesk√Ω lev (Czech Lion). In 2010, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the building where the Committee of Good Will is located (Prague, Senov√°≈æn√© n√°mƒõst√≠ 2); since 2012, a new street in ≈Ωi≈ækov-Vackov bears the name of Olga Havel.

P. parva grows to about 2.7 centimetres (1.1 in) SL and is endemic to Brazil where it occurs in the Amazon and Essequibo River basins. Paracanthopoma parva has been found on the gills of another species of giant catfish, Brachyplatystoma vaillanti. Species within the genus Paracanthopoma have the longest and most robust snout, and the longest and strongest dentary teeth among blood-feeding candirus, which fit their drilling needs. Riding on a giant host is advantageous for dispersal, no need to search for hosts to feed, and protection from predators. It is unlikely that Paracanthopoma takes blood from the tiny holes it drills in the skin; the areas these fish attach to have no large blood vessels to supply them with blood, and fish that have been riding are found only with trace amounts of blood in their digestive tracts. Also, most vandelliine candirus take blood from the gill region of their hosts. An undescribed species of Paracanthopoma has been found to ride Zungaro zungaro catfish; their snouts were buried up to the eyes in the tough skin on the host's caudal and pectoral fins, as well as the base of the dorsal fin.

Geography  Deutschneudorf is situated next to the border to the Czech Republic in the valley of the Schweinitz river, downstream from Nov√° Ves v Hor√°ch. It is a dispersed settlement typical for the upper regions of the Ore Mountains. The villages of Deutschkatharinenberg and Oberlochm√ºhle, located downstream on the Schweinitz, Br√ºderwiese, located upstream on the Schweinitz tributary M√ºhlgraben, and Deutscheinsiedel, northeast of the latter, have been incorporated administratively. The municipality is traversed by state road S214, which meets in Deutscheinsiedel with Saxon state roads S207 from Sayda and S213 from Seiffen, and with Czech state road 271 from Litv√≠nov.  History  First mining activities in the area of the later municipality are reported from about 1514. August Rohdt, owner of smelting works in Gr√ºnthal was awarded the mines Fortuna and Pallas in 1620, and had an iron furnace built in 1637 to supply the wire drawing mill in Rothenthal. The settlement in an area that was nearly depopulated after the Thirty Years' War and a plague outbreak is first mentioned in a document of 1651 as Naudorff unterm Catherbergk (referring to the dialectal name of nearby St. Katharinaberg) and had only three houses in 1657. Protestant refugees from St. Katharinaberg settled on clearings and were welcomed as skilled workers. A teacher is first reported in 1718, the church is completed in 1736 and the schoolhouse in 1741. In 1802 Deutschneudorf becomes an independent church parish. The voluntary fire department is established in 1875, the municipal offices are built in 1924, and an open-air swimming pool in 1936. In 1927 the Olbernhau-Gr√ºnthal‚ÄìDeutschneudorf railway is opened. Oberlochm√ºhle is incorporated into Deutschneudorf on 1 April 1939. In 1944/1945 Wehrmacht units establish a depot for stolen art. A forced march of German-speaking people expelled from Chomutov on 9 June 1945 which caused many deaths led through Deutschneudorf and is commemorated in a monument. Passenger traffic on the railway from Olbernhau ceased in 1966, the line was closed to freight in 1969 and dismantled in 1971. A central drinking water supply is built from 1966 to 1970. The community of Deutscheinsiedel (with Br√ºderwiese) joins Deutschneudorf on 1 January 1999. Deutschneudorf was one of the first places to suffer inundations during the 2002 European floods. The municipality was known as the site of a dig for Gold stolen by Nazi Germany in World War II. Radar scans of an abandoned copper mine suggested the presence of a large amount of dense metal believed to be too dense to be copper. On 28 February 2008, it was reported by CNN and other media outlets that digging had halted due to a disagreement between the two leaders of the dig.http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/science/02/28/nazi.gold/ It has been speculated that the contents of the Amber Room may also be found in this mine.http://en.ria.ru/culture/20120403/172588862.html References External links *Photo Gallery The Amber Room Der Spiegel 20 February 2008 Category:Czech Republic‚ÄìGermany border crossings Category:Erzgebirgskreis Category:Bezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt ","title":"Deutschneudorf"},{"id":"12240880","text":"Drebach is a municipality in the district of Erzgebirgskreis, in Saxony, Germany.

Career Born in the tiny mining settlement of Drumsmudden, near Drongan in Ayrshire, Linwood began working in the mines at the age of 14. He played schools and juvenile football before joining the newly formed Muirkirk Juniors in 1938. Linwood signed for St Mirren the same year, however on the outbreak of World War II, the player was forced to resume his mining career for the war effort. A centre-forward, Linwood continued to play wartime football for St. Mirren and also played in an unofficial international match against England at Maine Road in 1943 which the Scots lost 8‚Äì0. In all, Linwood scored 165 goals in 236 competitive matches for St Mirren between 1938‚Äì1946 and remains the club's second top goalscorer of all time. Linwood moved to Middlesbrough in 1946 but struggled to make an impact in the English First Division, partly due to still having to work as a miner while his teammates were full-time professionals. The player returned to Hibernian and won the Scottish Football League championship in 1948, his only senior footballing honour. Later in 1948, Linwood represented the Scottish League XI. In November 1949, now as a Clyde player, Linwood scored in his only cap for Scotland, a 2‚Äì0 win over Wales in a British Home Championship match which doubled as a 1950 World Cup qualifier.

The war was fought on the one side by ≈†vitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. ≈†vitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War (1431‚Äì1435) but failed to secure victory for ≈†vitrigaila. When Sigismund captured power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of ≈†vitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433. The war ended in a decisive defeat for ≈†vitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Pabaiskas in September 1435. ≈†vitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440. Prelude The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland had created several tenuous unions in the decades preceding the conflict, including the 1385 Union of Krewo, the 1392 Ostr√≥w Agreement, and the 1413 Union of Horod≈Ço. The two states had successfully joined forces against a common enemy, the Teutonic Knights, at the 1410 Battle of Grunwald. The Knights' defeat in the battle weakened but did not completely vanquish their military power and they continued to engage in lesser conflicts. Internal tensions within the tentatively unified state persisted after the battle. While Jogaila (Jagie≈Ç≈Ço) and Vytautas had converted to Roman Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox elite, along with some Lithuanian magnates, opposed a closer union with Poland. On 27 October 1430 Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, suddenly died without leaving an heir or a will. His coronation as King of Lithuania had been scheduled for September 1430, but the Poles had prevented the crown from reaching Lithuania. Vytautas' only daughter, Sophia of Lithuania, had married Vasily I of Moscow and had only one surviving son, Vasily II. He was Orthodox and could not lead the recently Christianized Catholic Grand Duchy. Their adherence to the Orthodox faith also prevented many other Gediminids from becoming pretenders to the throne. There were two most suitable Catholic candidates: Vytautas' brother and legal heir, Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis, and Vytautas' cousin ≈†vitrigaila. The Lithuanian nobles unilaterally elected ≈†vitrigaila as the new Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413, wherein the Lithuanians had pledged not to elect a new Grand Duke without the approval of the Kingdom of Poland. At the time Jogaila (Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), King of Poland and brother of ≈†vitrigaila, was in Lithuania and participated in the funeral of Vytautas. On 7 November 1430, he announced that he approved the election and that Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relationship would be formally determined on 15 August 1431. However, an armed conflict erupted due to territorial disputes in Podolia and Volhynia, which, according to the understanding of the Polish nobility, under the terms of a 1411 agreement, were to have been ruled by Lithuania only during the lifetime of Vytautas. Lutsk War ≈†vitrigaila as portrayed by Alexander Guagnini When Polish troops invaded Podolia, ≈†vitrigaila arrested his brother Jogaila, King of Poland, in Vilnius. Jogaila was released when he promised to return Podolia to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish nobility, led by Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, gathered in Sandomierz in February 1431. Outraged, they voided the King's promises and demanded that ≈†vitrigaila acknowledge his fealty to Jogaila. ≈†vitrigaila refused, professed full independence, and even asked Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund to send him the crown that had been intended for Vytautas. In the same letter, ≈†vitrigaila promised his loyalty to Sigismund and discussed a possible marriage to a daughter of Voivode of Moldavia. ≈†vitrigaila began organizing a wider anti-Polish coalition. He negotiated with the Teutonic Knights, with Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, with Moldavia, with the Golden Horde, and with the dukes of the eastern lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The most promising prospect as an ally was the Teutonic Order, which was seeking to undo the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union that had led to the Order's defeat at the Battle of Grunwald (1410). In June 1431 the Teutonic Knights and ≈†vitrigaila signed the Treaty of Christmemel. ≈†vitrigaila's cause was also aided by Moldavian forces led by Alexander the Good, who attacked Poland in the southeast. On 25 June 1431, the Polish army invaded Volhynia. They captured part of Volhynia, Horod≈Ço, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Zbarazh, and defeated ≈†vitrigaila's men near Lutsk. However, the Poles did not succeed in capturing Lubart's Castle. At the same time, pursuant to the Treaty of Christmemel, the Teutonic Knights declared war and invaded Poland. Finding little opposition, the Knights ravaged Dobrzy≈Ñ Land, taking the town of Nieszawa, and tried to move on to the Kuyavia and Krajna regions. However, the Teutonic army was defeated on 13 September 1431 at DƒÖbki, near Nakel (now Nak≈Ço nad NoteciƒÖ). ≈†vitrigaila, who was besieged in the Lubart's Castle, offered to negotiate peace on 20 August. An agreement was reached on 26 August, thus ending the so-called Lutsk War. A formal truce was signed at Staryi Chortoryisk on 1 September until 24 June 1433. The agreement was more favorable to Poland. The truce did not solve the underlying dispute, however. The war was transformed into a diplomatic struggle, as Poland sought to turn the Lithuanian nobles against ≈†vitrigaila. Coup in Lithuania Royal seal of Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis In April 1432 at Sieradz, the Poles offered to ≈†vitrigaila the same deal as Vytautas had during his reign: ≈†vitrigaila would be the Grand Duke and Jogaila would be the Supreme Duke and after ≈†vitrigaila's death Lithuanian throne would revert to one of Jogaila's sons. ≈†vitrigaila ostensibly refused the offer crystallizing local resistance. On 31 August 1432, conspirators, including Semen Olshanski, Petras Mangirdaitis, and Jonas Go≈°tautas, attacked ≈†vitrigaila and his escort at Ashmyany, where they were staying the night. ≈†vitrigaila and some of his supporters, including Jurgis Gedgaudas and Jonas Manvydas, managed to escape to Polotsk while his pregnant wife was detained. The conspirators installed Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis, brother of Vytautas, as the new Grand Duke. It is unclear what groups supported Sigismund or why. Possibly some Lithuanian nobles were displeased with favors that ≈†vitrigaila had granted to the Orthodox dukes, but prior to the coup no opposition had manifested itself. Sigismund, who had not played a major role in Lithuanian politics before the coup, and who had initially supported ≈†vitrigaila, resumed the policy of union with Poland. On 15 October 1432 he signed the Union of Grodno, which in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas had enjoyed during his reign. Following Sigismund's death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland. Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland in disputed Podolia and Volhynia. To win support from the nobles, in May 1434 Sigismund granted a privilege to both Catholic and Orthodox nobles. The privilege guaranteed their right to buy, sell, exchange, gift, and inherit land. The veldamas, a class of dependent peasants, were released from taxes and obligations to the state‚Äîall their earnings now belonged to the nobles. No noble was to be punished or imprisoned for crimes without a court order. Lithuania divided into two camps: supporters of Sigismund (the Lithuanian lands, Samogitia, Trakai Voivodeship, and Minsk); and supporters of ≈†vitrigaila (Polotsk, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Volhynia). There began three years of devastating hostilities. On 8 December 1432 the armies of ≈†vitrigaila and Sigismund met in the Battle of A≈°mena. ≈†vitrigaila had enlisted the aid of Sayid Ahmad I, Khan of the Golden Horde, and wrote to Pope Eugene IV and Council of Florence hoping to gain their support by promising a church union. He planned to attack the Grand Duchy's capital, Vilnius, and resume the throne. Both sides suffered heavy losses, and final victory went to Sigismund. The Teutonic Order officially observed the truce, but continued its secret support for ≈†vitrigaila, mostly through its Livonian branch. Hussite invasion of Prussia In June 1433 Poland allied itself with the Czech Hussites in order to stop the Teutonic Order from sending secret support to ≈†vitrigaila via its Livonian branch. The Teutonic Knights had supported the Pope and Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund against the heretic Hussites during the Hussite Wars. During their last and largest \\"beautiful ride\\", the Czech forces under Jan ƒåapek of S√°ny were also supported by Pomeranian Duke Bogus≈Çaw IX of the Duchy of Stolp (S≈Çupsk). For four months the Hussite army ravaged Teutonic territories in Neumark, Pomerania, and western Prussia. They attacked Konitz (now Chojnice), Schwetz (now ≈öwiecie) and Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk). They captured several towns and castles, including Dirschau (now Tczew) on 29 August 1433. Despite their failed siege of Danzig, the Hussites celebrated their \\"beautiful ride\\" by symbolically filling their bottles with water from the Baltic Sea. On 13 September 1433 a truce was signed at Jasiniec. Polish‚ÄìTeutonic negotiations continued at Brze≈õƒá Kujawski, and Hussite‚ÄìCatholic negotiations continued at the Council of Florence and at the Czech Diet in Prague. The Polish-led invasion of Neumark and Pomerania had proven successful, cutting the Teutonic Order off from support from the Holy Roman Empire, and convincing the Order to sign a treaty with the Poles. On 15 December 1433, twelve-year Truce of ≈Åƒôczyca was signed between the Poles and the Order at ≈Åƒôczyca (leading some Polish historians to divide this Polish‚ÄìTeutonic War into two wars: in 1431‚Äì1433; and in 1435). The Teutonic Knights agreed to most of the Polish demands, including that the Order cease its support for ≈†vitrigaila, each side would control the territories that it occupied until a peace was signed (uti possidetis), and no party would seek mediation by foreign powers in order to alter this truce. This marked the end of the war on Polish soil; the struggle on Lithuanian lands would continue for two more years, as the truce with Poland did not extend to the Livonian Order. Decisive battle In July and August 1433, ≈†vitrigaila and his Livonian allies raided Lida, Kreva and Ei≈°i≈°kƒós and devastated the suburbs of Vilnius, Trakai and Kaunas. The hostilities were briefly stopped by horse plague. When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for ≈†vitrigaila, who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites. In July 1435, ≈†vitrigaila foiled a coup against him in Smolensk. Coup leader Orthodox bishop Gerasim, consecrated as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1432, was burned at the stake. The final battle, at Pabaiskas, was fought in September 1435 near Ukmergƒó (Vilkomir, Wi≈Çkomierz), northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides. ≈†vitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian‚ÄìPolish army, led by Michael ≈Ωygimantaitis, and soundly defeated. ≈†vitrigaila, with a small group of followers, managed to escape to Polotsk. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410. On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brze≈õƒá Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for ≈†vitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Peace of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski showed that the Teutonic Knights had lost their universal missionary status. The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish‚ÄìLithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66), the civil war that would tear Prussia in half. Aftermath ≈†vitrigaila was losing his influence in the Slavic principalities and could no longer resist Poland and Sigismund. On 4 September 1437 he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the lands that still backed him (chiefly Kiev and Volhynia), and after his death these territories would pass to the King of Poland. However, under strong protest from Sigismund, the Polish Senate declined to ratify the treaty . In 1438 ≈†vitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia. The reign of Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis was brief ‚Äî he was assassinated in 1440. ≈†vitrigaila returned from exile in 1442 and ruled Lutsk until his death a decade later. Jogaila's son Casimir IV Jagiellon, born in 1426, received approval as a hereditary hospodar from Lithuania's ruling families in 1440. This event is seen by the historians Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki as marking the end of the succession dispute.

Apulco was declared a town in 1821.\\"Apulco\\", Encyclopedia de Municipios References External links * Official website Category:Populated places in Zacatecas ","title":"Apulco"},{"id":"12241157","text":"Dr. Samuel Bennett is a character on the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice. He is portrayed by actor Taye Diggs.Private Practice at The Futon Critic Character history Dr. Sam Bennett, or \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" as he's known to patients across the globe, is another founding partner of the Oceanside Wellness Group and the practice's internist. He is the author of the best- selling nonfiction book, Body Language: The Mind-Body Connection. Oceanside Wellness Group, with its co-operative and whole-body approach to medicine, is illustrative of the views advocated in the book. In \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" (Season 3, Episode 03) it is said that he did his residency in surgery, specializing in Cardiothoracic Surgery. In \\"The Next Episode\\" (Season 6, Episode 05), Sam's mother, Dee, comes to him for help for her boss, Raymond, who has heart issues. Sam is thrown when he sees Dee kissing the married Raymond and realizes they're having an affair. When Raymond collapses after surgery, Sam discovers he needs a new lung but there are no donors. Raymond's wife, Jillian, shocks everyone by first revealing she has known all along about Raymond and Dee's affair and also by how Raymond is Sam's real father. Sam is naturally jarred to learn his mother has lied to him all his life and how Raymond helped pay for Sam's medical school costs. Sam talks to Raymond, telling him that he's become the man he is despite Raymond not being around. Raymond replies that he is proud of that man, he and Sam shaking hands to part on good terms. Relationships Sam met Naomi in medical school at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where they also met and befriended Derek Shepherd, Mark Sloan and Addison Montgomery. The two married and had a daughter, Maya Bennett, now age 15. Although the couple attempt to present the image of an amicably divorced couple, the post-marital relationship has, at times, been strained. The reasons for their divorce are unclear. In \\"The Other Side of This Life\\", Sam professes to Addison that he had \\"no good reason\\" for requesting the divorce. In the episode, In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else, Sam states that he was \\"unhappy\\" and wanted Naomi to fight for their relationship. The couple looked to be headed toward reconciliation. Sam and Naomi rekindle their sexual relationship in In Which Sam Gets Taken For a Ride, after Sam survives a hostage situation. Although Sam and Naomi called the conference-room sex a \\"slip up,\\" the couple sleep together again in In Which Cooper Finds a Port In His Storm. It appears that Sam and Naomi share joint custody of Maya, although her primary residence may be with Naomi. In the episode In Which Addison Finds the Magic, Naomi states that Maya had asked to spend the entire week at Sam's home. Sam asked Addison out before Naomi when attending Columbia. It was revealed in season 3, episode 7 of Private Practice that Sam and Addison might be harboring feelings for each other after sharing a kiss at the end of a terrifying ordeal. They kiss again when Addison decided to sleep over at Sam's, hurt and vulnerable after finding her mom and Susan kissing. When Mark Sloan comes to the practice for a checkup with his pregnant teen daughter Sloan, Sam catches him and Addison having sex in her office. Sam is shown to be concerned, as he knows about Mark's playboyish ways, and didn't want Mark to lead Addison on, hinting a bit of jealousy. Following that, they became closer until Addison put a halt on their developing relationship in \\"Shotgun,\\" worried about the consequences in her relationship with Naomi for sleeping with Sam. In \\"Love Bites,\\" Addison admitted to Pete, with whom she was having comfort sex, that she was in love with Sam, though he is angry and hurt by her rejection at the end of the last episode. Sam begins seeing a well known doctor, Dr. Vanessa Hoyt, and Addison begins dating Pete. They still show they harbor feelings for each other, even a hint of jealousy when they see the other with their current significant others. Vanessa realized that Sam is still in love with Addison when Sam backed Addison up on how to treat a patient and the three surrogate babies she was carrying. She ends things with Sam. After she breaks up with Sam, he kisses Addison again, saying he was tired of doing the right thing, and wanted to do the wrong thing. Although she was with Pete, she kisses Sam back and Pete catches them. Naomi then finds out about their feelings for each other, and she decides to end her friendship with Addison. It is revealed that his daughter Maya is pregnant. Sam deals with this much better than Naomi, even supporting the marriage between Maya and Dink (the father), though he is certainly not pleased with the circumstances. After Maya and Dell get into a car accident, Addison operates on her to try and save her and her unborn child. The operation is successful and Maya gives birth to Sam's newborn granddaughter Olivia. Sam and Addison finally get together in the season 3 finale. During the season 4 opener Sam and Addison's relationship seemed to have not worked out, but at the end of the episode they are sharing a bathtub, showing that they are a couple indeed. In the second episode they debate over whether or not they want to go public with their newfound romance, mainly because of Naomi and how she would react. Sam urges Addison to tell Naomi about them, which she does, and she doesn't take the news well. But Naomi tries to deal with the fact that her best friend and ex-husband are together and maintained a friendship with Addison. Addison and Sam's relationship, which Addison dubbed \\"AddiSam\\" is shown to be a healthy and steady relationship, as Addison says that Sam is the perfect guy \\"with no flaws\\". Although Addison wants to have children, Sam tells her he's not ready to have more children, as he wants to take time in their romance. Addison's mother Bizzy returns seeking Addison's help in treating her partner Susan, ill with a tumor. After Addison and Dr. Rodriguez seem to have cured her cancer, Addison plans Bizzy and Susan's wedding. After Naomi spots Dr. Rodriguez flirting with Addison, she tells Addison that her and Sam's relationship is becoming serious and real, and that's when Addison usually screws up. Addison assures Naomi that she doesn't want to ruin it with Sam. Out of panic, she proposes to Sam. He talks to Amelia, telling her that although he didn't want to rule out marriage, it was too early in the relationship, and he knew it didn't feel right. Reception Shawna Malcom of the Los Angeles Times deemed Sam and Bailey her favourite pairing of the Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice crossover, praising: \\"The grief he gave her about becoming a pediatric surgeon ‚Ä¶ the grief she gave him for letting ex-wife Naomi go and wind up in the arms of Archer ‚Ä¶ the fist bump. I say again, the fist bump! Together, Chandra Wilson and Taye Diggs are hilarious and touching and all sorts of fabulous.

Rawlings served the 40th legislative district, located in the central, northwest section of Baltimore, from 1979 until 2003. His daughter, Stephanie Rawlings- Blake, is the former Mayor of Baltimore. Background Delegate Rawlings was born in Baltimore on March 17, 1937 to Howard Toussaint and Beatrice Peters Rawlings. His father worked as a custodian in a department store and then for U.S. Postal Service. Rawlings and his five brothers and sisters grew up in public housing, he graduated from Douglass High School, one of the three schools African Americans were allowed to attend prior to the Supreme Court Decision in Brown v. Board of Education. He earned a B.S. in mathematics from Morgan State College, an M.S. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and completed Ph.D. coursework at the University of Maryland. Rawlings was a professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County from 1969-1972. While at UMBC, he served as the chair of the UMBC Black Caucus of Faculty & Staff and the Black Coalition of the University of Maryland Campuses.Faculty staff: Black caucus, 1969-1971 (folder), President's office records, University Archives, Collection 50, Special Collections, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (Baltimore, MD). In the Legislature Delegate Rawlings was a member of Maryland's House of Delegates from January 10, 1979 until his death on November 14, 2003. He was appointed chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1992. In his years as chairman, Delegate Rawlings developed a reputation for integrity, dedication to his city, and a detailed knowledge of the state budget. He was in the forefront of reforming inner-city public schools, including requiring accountability from Baltimore school officials for lack of educational progress, waste of state funds, and allegations of fraud in spending those funds. He co-sponsored legislation that banned racial profiling in Maryland and fought against Maryland Lottery drawings expanding to Sundays. He also played an instrumental role in securing funding for the Reginald F.

Political leader In 1999, after Kurt Schmoke, Baltimore's three-term mayor, decided not to seek re-election, Rawlings started a search for Baltimore's next mayor. At first he tried to encouracge NAACP president Kweisi Mfume to run, but Mfume declined. He then threw his support behind Baltimore City Council member Martin O'Malley in the mayoral election. It was a risky choice because O'Malley, who is white, was running against two African-American males in a city that was and still is majority African-American, and Rawlings himself was an African-American. Legacy Less than a month before his death, Rawlings was named the national education Policy Leader of the Year by the National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE). At the award ceremony in Baltimore, Brenda Welburn, NASBE Executive Director said \\"Delegate Rawlings has been a long-time champion of expanding educational opportunities and access for all of Maryland's students. He has also been in the national forefront of insisting upon greater accountability from our education system, both of teacher performance and student achievement, as well as focusing on closing the achievement gap among minority students. In demanding resources for results, his overriding concern has always been focused on best helping students succeed\\".Howard \\"Pete\\" Rawlings Named National Education Policy Leader Of The Year Howard P.

It is located in Centar municipality \\"the medieval Kale fortress ‚Äì which overlooks the Old Bazaar ‚Äì and the Ottoman Old Stone Bridge (Kameniot most) crossing over the Vardar have remained under the responsibility of another municipality ‚Äì that of Centar.\\" and situated on the highest point in the city overlooking the Vardar River. The fortress is depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag.Official portal of the city of Skopje History The first fortress was built in 6th century AD on a land that was inhabited during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages (roughly 4000 BC onwards). It was constructed with yellow limestone and travertine, along with fragments of Latin inscriptions. Material for the fortress originated from the Roman city of Skupi, which was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 518. Justinian I, Byzantine Emperor The fortress is thought to have been built during the rule of emperor Justinian I and constructed further during the 10th and 11th centuries over the remains of emperor Justinian's Byzantine fortress which may have been destroyed due to a number of wars and battles in the region. The city was capital of the First Bulgarian Empire between 992 and 1015, and was center of the uprising of the Bulgarian Empire against the Byzantine Empire under the rule of Peter Delyan. Not much is known about the Medieval fortress apart from a few documents which outline minor characteristics in the fortress' appearance. In 1346 at the Skopje Fortress, Stefan Du≈°an adopted the title of Emperor at his coronation and he had transferred the capital of Serbian Empire to Skopje. The coronation of the Emperor Stefan Du≈°an in Skopje, part of the Slav Epic series by Alfons Mucha, 1926 In 1660, Evliya √áelebi, a chronicler of the Ottoman Empire, wrote an in-depth account on the appearance of the fortress while traveling through the territories of the Empire: The fortress was partially destroyed yet again by an earthquake in 1963 but was not reconstructed until recently. Excavation and restoration efforts Night view of the fortress. Interior of the fortress. In late 2006 and early 2007, research and excavation of the Skopje Fortress funded by the Macedonian government had finally commenced. Researchers discovered woodwind instruments and clay ornaments dating as far back as 3000 B.C. Excavation of the main fortress also revealed houses below the fortress' visible level. The discoveries are believed to have belonged to inhabitants of Scupi on which the fortress was built. Archaeological excavations continued in 2009. In May 2010, archeologists unearthed the largest stash of Byzantine coins ever found in Macedonia at the fortress. After the foundations of a 13th-century church were found within the complex, the Cultural Heritage Protection Office actioned a project to restore it in the form of a church museum. Ethnic Albanian groups, with DUI at the forefront, claimed the site contained an older Illyrian structure, and that by virtue of their claimed Illyrian ancestry, the site should be theirs. The dispute revolved around competing claims to the area as being either Christian or Muslim and Macedonian or Albanian. On February 10, 2011, late at night, a crowd of about 100 ethnic Albanians converged on the site to find over 50 construction workers from Bitola working on the steel church museum.Dram√´ n√´ Kala t√´ Shkupit, kisha nd√´rtohet nat√´n Retrieved 8/20/2012 When questioned who ordered the construction the workers refused to answer but revealed that they were instructed to start building from 10:00 PM over the night. Some of the crowd proceeded to destroy and vandalize parts of the scaffolding, the same day restoration was resumed after it was officially halted by the government. The construction workers were removed from the building site by the Macedonian police. According to media footage, high- ranking ethnic Albanian ministers and members of DUI leadership were among the crowd. Two weeks prior to the event, DUI spokespeople had demanded the termination of the project. During the next two days, Macedonians on Facebook called on each other to converge on the site and protect the site and its workers. Members of both groups arrived almost simultaneously on February 13 and a violent clash erupted, leaving around 10 injured, including 2 policemen. The opposition, Macedonian and Albanian, condemned the violence, criticized the prime minister Nikola Gruevski for creating inter-ethnic tensions and called on the government to take responsibility for it. The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, the most numerous opposition party, claimed that this event was staged as an attempt to distract the people of Macedonia from the reigning poverty and corruption. The Albanian New Democracy also reacted that \\"they should not destroy the future of the country by focusing on its past\\" The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted: > \\"The decision of the Government of Macedonia to construct a church-museum on > the Skopje Fortress on its most visible spot is going to create serious > tensions in the society. Turkey pays special attention to preserving and > protecting the cultural heritage that is left in Macedonia from the Ottoman > Empire\\". Various political analysts claimed that the incident was orchestrated by the Macedonian and Albanian governing parties, namely VMRO-DPMNE and the Democratic Union for Integration. Vllado Dimovski, head of the \\"Center for inter-ethnic tolerance\\" in Macedonia, stated that \\"the coalition partners (VMRO-DPMNE and DUI) orchestrated the violent event on the Skopje Fortress to distract the public from the problems that the country is facing\\".

The idea to form a paratrooper unit within the Waffen- SS allegedly came directly from Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Creation Adolf Hitler supposedly got the idea in September 1943, after Operation Eiche (\\"Oak\\") which was launched on 12 September and included an airborne raid on Gran Sasso. The operation was planned by Kurt Student. During this raid, a group of German parachutists freed deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Otto Skorzeny took part in the raid by command of German dictator Adolf Hitler. The raid included a daring military-based assault on the Campo Imperatore Hotel at Gran Sasso and managed to rescue Mussolini, only firing a single shot. Considering that the new Waffen-SS unit of parachutists had to be employed in dangerous actions behind enemy lines, it was decided to extend enlistment to those in the SS disciplinary units which were formed from officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers who had violated military law. An order of the SS-FHA (the SS High Command) fixed a percentage of 50% for the unit coming from volunteers of Waffen-SS units, the rest from volunteers from the disciplinary units. The gathering of personnel for the new unit was in Chlum in Czechoslovakia in October 1943. The first commander of the battalion was SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Gilhofer, coming from the 21st SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment of the 10th SS-Panzer-Division Frundsberg. In November 1943, the battalion began its training in the spa Mataru≈°ka Banja, close to Kraljevo, Serbia, with the Luftwaffe Fallschirmschule number 3. The training was completed in the area around P√°pa, Hungary at the beginning of 1944. On 19 March of 1944, the 500th SS parachute battalion took part in the German occupation of Hungary, Operation Margarethe. Operation R√∂sselsprung The 500th was led by Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Kurt Rybka during its daring but unsuccessful parachute and glider-borne assault on Tito's headquarters outside Drvar on 25 May 1944. The raid was called Operation R√∂sselsprung (Knight's move). Two companies were dropped directly on Tito's supposed headquarters location while the other two were landed by DFS 230 glider. The first wave of paratroopers, following a heavy bombardment by the Luftwaffe, landed in between the area of the cave, (Tito's hideout) and the town of Drvar on open ground and many were gunned down by members of the Tito Escort Battalion, a company numbering fewer than 100 soldiers. The second wave of paratroopers missed their target altogether and landed a few miles outside the town. Tito was long gone when the paratroopers captured the cave. Next to the cave's exit, there was a path leading to a railroad where Tito boarded a train that took him to safety. Tito had been forewarned and evaded capture while the numerically superior Yugoslav Partisans drove off the SS paratroopers. Over 800 of the 1,000 personnel who participated in the operation were killed or wounded. The survivors were at first sent to Petrovac then Ljubljana, where they remained until the end of June. They were then transferred to Gotenhafen (Gdynia), West Prussia to take part in the planned occupation of the Finnish- controlled √Öland Islands in the Baltic Sea, but this was cancelled. They were then sent to join III. SS-Panzerkorps at Narva, but were ordered to be flown to Kaunas, Lithuania on 9 July. There they formed a kampfgruppe with I./Panzerregiment GD to relieve the trapped German forces at Vilnius. Subsequently, they often acted as 3rd Panzer Army's 'fire brigade' in its defense of the Baltic States. By 20 August 1944, they were down to a strength of 90 men,Munoz, Anthonio J. - Forgotten Legions: Obscure Combat Formations of the Waffen-SS, p. 42 but remained in combat for the next several months as the Germans were desperate for any and all combat troops to stave off the Soviet offensives. The paras were finally relieved in late October and flown to Deutsch-Wagram, Austria where they were incorporated into the SS- Fallschirmj√§gerbataillon 600 after a week's rest. The SS-Fallschirmj√§ger never fought in France. It is sometimes stated in histories of the French Resistance that SS paratroopers carried out a parachute assault in July 1944 against French partisan forces on the Vercors plateau in the French Alps where hundreds of partisans had created a stronghold from which they were mounting operations against the German occupiers. However, they were not Waffen-SS but Luftwaffe special forces from the secretive Kampfgeschwader 200. These para- trained commandos of II./KG 200 remain a little-known arm of Germany's World War II parachute forces and were listed on II./KG 200's ORBAT (Order of Battle) as the 3rd Staffel. 600th SS-Parachute Battalion The second Budapest mission, Operation Panzerfaust, can be said to have been, officially, the 600's first mission although the new battalion was not formally mustered until 9 November 1944 in Neu-Strelitz, their garrison town. The soldiers of the 500th who survived long enough to see the formation of the 600 were also given back their previous ranks and the right to wear the sig rune on 9 November 1944. Two companies of the newly forming SS-Fallschirmj√§ger-Btl 600 were then attached to Otto Skorzeny's Panzerbrigade 150 in December 1944 for the Ardennes offensive. It was the only occasion in which SS paratroopers faced the Western Allies until, fleeing the Soviets, they surrendered to US forces early in May 1945. After the Ardennes, the 600th fought on the Oder Front in the Schwedt and Zehden bridgeheads. See also *Fallschirmj√§ger Literature *Munoz, Anthonio J.

Her sobriquet ‚ÄúLady Vic‚Äù is short for \\"Lady Victim\\", referring to any of her possible targets. Publication history Lady Vic first appeared in Nightwing #4 and was created by Chuck Dixon and Scott McDaniel. Fictional character biography Lady Elaine is descended from a long line of British soldiers and mercenaries, and a genuine English aristocrat. The money she earns from her secret career helps prevent foreclosure on her impoverished family estate. She completes an assignment for Bl√ºdhaven gang boss Antonio ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù MarinNightwing #4 and returns to Bl√ºdhaven to collect her fee, and is upset to find Marin missing.

Dudley Soames informs her that Marin had been replaced by Blockbuster, and offers to pay her fee, with a retainer to continue working for him. Elaine is one of Blockbuster‚Äôs hirelings tasked with tracking down Oracle. When Blockbuster was dying of heart failure, Elaine is entrusted with locating Gorilla City in Africa, and finding a replacement heart. Lady Vic is sent to eliminate Tarantula, Blockbuster's latest ally, when Tarantula had disobeyed his orders.

In The New 52, Lady Vic makes her debut in the series Batwing.Batwing #21 Powers and abilities > \\"Talks like Jane Seymour, fights like Bruce Lee\\". - Nightwing Elaine is a highly skilled martial artist and athlete, and equally skilled with firearms. She has a sentimental preference for a collection of antique weapons handed down by her ancestors, souvenirs of their colonial exploits: a matched pair of Katar (‡§ï‡§ü‡§æ‡§∞), a Japanese katana, a Thuggee strangling cloth, a Maasai javelin, and a Webley revolver. Of the mercenaries regularly employed by Blockbuster, Elaine is one of the most skilled, certainly more skilled than Brutale, Stallion, or Electrocutioner, though usually not on the level of opponents such as Nightwing or Batman, though she has nearly beaten Nightwing. When Blockbuster decided to test Shrike‚Äôs abilities by pitting him against all of his regular assassins at once, Elaine lasted the longest, and was the only one to actually inflict a wound on him, and almost killed him, before being knocked out. She also nearly defeated Nightwing in their first fight, and had an upper hand in the battle. She also effortlessly defeated Tarantula in two separate encounters. These feats place Lady Elaine Marsh-Morton among the best martial artists in the DC universe. Lady Vic also has qualities of determination and ruthlessness that set her apart from the others. Possibly this is because she desperately needs the money she earns, for the sake of her family‚Äôs continued standing and honor. As mentioned above, she was more than willing to kill a young girl to get paid; during the Hunt for Oracle storyline, when Black Canary escaped from a plane in which she was being held prisoner, Lady Vic astonished her by leaping into the sky after her, without a parachute.

Wilma resists the peer-pressure tactics of pre-teen pothead Stoney and instead seeks advice from her parents, who tell her that a real friend wouldn't offer her drugs. To the tune of La Toya Jackson's original composition, \\"Just Say No,\\" Wilma, Freddy and the others establish their own \\"Just Say No\\" club. Next, Freddy starts up a pet cleaning service to raise ticket money for the upcoming Michael Jackstone concert. But Freddy's get-rich-quick scheme falls through due to Stoney and his gang tampering of the instructions for each pet. After figuring out what the other kids did, the children realize that their only hope of obtaining tickets is to beat Stoney and his gang at the upcoming Riddle Rally, to which they succeeded. Stoney was later arrested for drug usage. The program concludes with a version of Michael Jackson's hit song \\"Beat It,\\" with the lyrics specially rewritten to convey an anti-drug theme. This special also features comments from then-First Lady Nancy Reagan, Honorary Chair of the \\"Just Say No Foundation\\", who offers a message of support to children who have chosen to live a drug-free life.

He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford.  Olympics  In 1920, Templeton was on the United States Olympic team in rugby and the long jump. He was handicapped in his best event, the high jump, because he normally used the Western roll jumping style, which was considered illegal at that time. In the long jump, he finished out of the medals in fourth place, but the U.S. rugby team upset France to win the gold medal.  Track coach  In 1922, Templeton returned to Stanford as its track coach, a position he held until 1939. During his tenure as coach, Stanford won the NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1925, 1928, and 1934, and Stanford athletes won 19 individual titles. He was noted at the time for conducting intensive daily practices, an uncommon practice at that time. He later coached at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.

The vast majority of Russia's territory is unsuitable for grape growing, with most of the production concentrated in parts of Krasnodar and Rostov regions, as well as Crimea. The Russian market is characterized by the presence of many low- cost products, with a significant part of local wines having a retail price of less than 100 rubles ($). Attempts to shift away from the low-quality reputation of Soviet wines has been moderately successful, though 80% of wines sold in Russia in 2013 were made from grape concentrates. In 2014 Russia was ranked 11th worldwide by the area of vineyards under cultivation. The Russian wine industry is promoted by local authorities as a healthier alternative to spirits, which have a higher alcohol content. History Khutorok Winery in Kuban, 1910 Wild grape vines have grown around the Caspian, Black and Azov seas for thousands of years with evidence of viticulture and cultivation for trade with the Ancient Greeks found along the shores of the Black Sea at Phanagoria and Gorgippia.J. Robinson \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 597 Oxford University Press 2006 It is claimed that the Black Sea area is the world's oldest wine region. The founder of modern commercial wine- making in Russia was Prince Leo Galitzine (1845-1915), who established the first Russian factory of champagne wines at his Crimean estate of Novyi Svet. In 1889 the production of this winery won the Gold Medal at the Paris exhibition in the nomination for sparkling wines, although several years previously the wine regions of Russia had been devastated by the Phylloxera epidemic. In 1891, Galitzine congratulated himself on becoming the surveyor of imperial vineyards at Abrau-Dyurso, where the sparkling wine was produced throughout the 20th century under the brand of Soviet Champagne, or \\"champagne for the people\\". After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the French wine-savvy professionals fled Russia, but the industry was gradually reestablished, starting from 1920. According to Denis Puzyrev, before the 1917 Revolution wine was drunk in Russia only by the aristocracy, a situation that only changed under Soviet rule. The wine industry experienced a rebound in the 1940s and 1950s during the Soviet era until the domestic reforms pushed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 as part of his campaign against alcoholism. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the transition to a market economy with the privatization of land saw many of the area's prime vineyard spaces being utilized for other purposes. By 2000 the entire Russian Federation had only under cultivation, less than half the total area used in the early 1980s. Semi-sweet and sweet wines account for 80% of the Russian market, a share exceeding 90% in the economy segment. Since 2006, Russian wineries have adopted European techniques and standards. The Abrau-Durso winery is considered the flagship of the new wine industry. In 2018 and 2019 several Russian wines were rated by Robert Parker of The Wine Advocate and scored between 80 to 97 points. In 2020 Fanagoria Blanc de Blancs Brut, a 2017 wine from the Fanagoria Estate Winery in Fanagoria on the Taman Peninsula, was awarded a gold medal at the \\"Chardonnay du Monde\\" (\\"Chardonnay of the World\\") international tasting competition. Geography and climate North Caucasus in Russia The climate of the North Caucasus region, where most of Russia's vineyards are located, is typical of a continental region. To counter the severe winters many vine growers will cover their vines over with soil to protect the vines from frost. In the area of Krasnodar there are anywhere from 193-233 frost free days during the growing seasons that allow the vines in the area to grow to full ripening. The area of Dagestan has a varied climate with some areas semi-desert. About 13 percent of Russian wine is produced in the area around Stavropol which has 180-190 frost free days. The region of Rostov is characterized by its hot, dry summers and severe winters which produces grapes in lower yields than other parts of the country. Nevertheless Rostov is a region with a great diversity of atochtonous grape varieties which originally from the Don Valley including sunch az Tsimlyankskiy Tchernyi, Kumshatskiy, Krasnostop Zolotovskiy, Plechistik and others Wine and grapes Lefkadia vineyards Russia produces wine of several different styles including still, sparkling and dessert wine. Currently there are over 100 different varieties of grapes used in the production of Russian wine. The Rkatsiteli grape accounts for over 45 percent of production. Other varieties grown include Aligote, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Severny, Clairette blanche, Merlot, Muscat, Pinot gris, Plavai, Portugieser, Riesling, Saperavi, Silvaner, and Traminer. Russia currently has the following controlled appellations that correspond to the sorts of grapes: Sibirkovy (–°–∏–±–∏—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤—ã–π), Tsimlyanski Cherny (–¶–∏–º–ª—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —á—ë—Ä–Ω—ã–π), Plechistik (–ü–ª–µ—á–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫), Narma (–ù–∞—Ä–º–∞), and G√ºliabi Dagestanski (–ì—é–ª—è–±–∏ –î–∞–≥–µ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π),J.

Ryan was also a dual international, playing for both Ireland teams ‚Äì the FAI XI and the IFA XI. He was the last player to represent both teams. He was more of a goal creator then a goalscorer. Club career =Early years= Ryan initially played gaelic football for the Marino School in Dublin while growing up, but then switched to soccer after moving to Blackpool during the early years of the Second World War. He then played with Claremount School, Blackpool Boys, various factory teams and had trials with both Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest before joining Nuneaton Borough. =Coventry City= Ryan had two spells with Coventry City. In April 1943 he signed for the club as an amateur and during the 1942‚Äì43 season he played 2 games in wartime regional leagues. He then turned professional in August 1944 and made a further 4 appearances for the club during the 1944‚Äì45 wartime season. After playing for West Bromwich Albion and Derby County, he returned to City in September 1958.

He scored his first two goals for the FAI XI in October 1953 during the qualifiers for the 1954 World Cup, one against France in a 5‚Äì3 defeat and the second, a penalty, against Luxembourg in 4‚Äì0 win. On 7 November 1954 in a friendly against Norway, he scored his third goal, again from the penalty spot, and earned the FAI XI a 2‚Äì1 victory. He made his last appearance for the FAI XI on 27 November 1955 in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Spain. Ireland (FAI) stats The Boys In Green ‚Äì The FAI International Story (1997): Sean Ryan =IFA XI= Ryan made his one and only appearance for the IFA XI in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Wales on 8 March 1950. As well as being part of the 1950 British Home Championship, the game also doubled up as a qualifier for the 1950 World Cup. Ryan, together with Con Martin, Davy Walsh and Tom Aherne, was one of four players born in the Irish Free State, included in the IFA XI that day. Ryan had earlier played for the FAI XI in the same competition, and as a result had played for two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament. This situation eventually led to intervention by FIFA and as a result Ryan became one of the last four Irish Free State ‚Äì born players to play for the IFA XI. Later years After retiring as a player in November 1960, Ryan worked as a pools supervisor for both Coventry City (1960‚Äì1961) and West Bromwich Albion (1961‚Äì1962). Between September 1962 and October 1976 he was chief scout for West Brom. He later worked as a scout for various clubs including Aston Villa, Derby County, Hereford United and Leeds United before retiring in 1994.

The products separate into two aqueous layers, with the sulfuric acid floating on top, and a mixture of hydrogen iodide and unreacted iodine on the bottom. While the two layers are generally considered immiscible, small amounts of sulfuric acid may still remain in the hydrogen iodide layer and vice versa. This can lead to unwanted side reactions, one of which precipitates out sulfur, a potential obstruction to the reaction vessel. The reaction is named after Robert Bunsen, who discovered it in 1853. A similar reaction is the basis for Karl Fischer titration. Note that at sufficiently high temperatures, concentrated H2SO4 may react with HI, giving I2, SO2 and H2O, which reverses the reaction. Many chemical processes are reversible reactions, such as ammonia production from N2 and H2, and removing the desired product will shift equilibrium to the right of the equation favoring reaction products as per the Le Chatelier principle.

The boat has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to ever bear the name Unrivalled. Completed in 1942, the boat spent most of the war in the Mediterranean. She sank a number of small merchant ships and naval auxiliaries, but major success eluded her during the war. Too small and slow for the post-war environment, Unrivalled was scrapped in 1946. Design and description HMS Unrivalled was one of the second group of U-class submarines ordered on 23 August 1940.Akermann, p. 409 These submarines differed from their predecessors in that they were lengthened by \\"to give a more streamlined shape aft and to improve the flow of water over the propellers.\\"Bragnasco, p. 121 The submarine was long and abeam. Unrivalled had a single hull with internal ballast tanks and had a draft of when surfaced. She displaced while submerged, but only on the surface.Bragnasco, p. 120 The submarine was equipped with two diesel engines and twin General Electric electric motors‚Äîfor surfaced and submerged running, respectively. They were coupled together with a diesel-electric transmission. Unrivalled had a surface speed of up to and could go as fast as while underwater.

HMS Unrivalled was equipped with four bow torpedo tubes and could carry eight torpedoes. The submarine was also armed with a QF Mk I gun deck gun. She had a crew of 33 men. Career Lt H B Turner RN, commanding officer of HMS Unrivalled, Malta, 26‚Äì28 January 1943 (IWM A14488) HMS Unrivalled was ordered on 23 August 1940 as part of the 1940 naval construction programme from Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness. She was laid down on 12 May 1941, launched on 16 February 1942 and commissioned on 3 May 1942. Apart from a work-up patrol in the Norwegian Sea, she spent the bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a submerged enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the Italian auxiliary submarine chaser O 97 / Margherita, the Italian merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the Italian tugs Genova and Iseo, the Italian sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Bor√©al, the Italian tanker Bivona, the small Italian merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the Italian auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small Italian vessel San Francisco di Paola A. Unrivalled also damaged the on 3 December 1942, but neither sank or damaged any Axis ships after 28 July 1943. During Operation Husky in July 1943, she was stationed offshore to mark the landing beaches for the 1st Canadian Infantry Division.Rohwer, p. 261 The boat survived the war, but was too slow for requirements and was not retained after the war.

Later, she led the United States national women's basketball team to their victory in the 1957 FIBA World Championship. Throughout her career, she was awarded numerous accolades, including her induction to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. Playing at a time when there were no major professional women's basketball leagues in the U.S., White distinguished herself, receiving many accolades as one of the greatest female players in history. Talented in multiple sports, she also was distinguished as an All- World player by the Amateur Softball Association.

He composed a number of patriotic songs including Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja and Subh Sukh Chain whilst serving in the Indian National Army. Later in life, Captain Singh worked for the Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and founded the Constabulary band. Early life Ram Singh was born in the Khanyara, a village near Dharamsala on 15 August 1914. As the son of a serviceman, Singh was encouraged to enroll in the army. After completing school in 1922, Singh joined the 1st Gorkha Rifles as a recruit in the band. From early childhood, he had an interest in music, which was encouraged by his grandfather, Jamni Chand, who migrated from Munakot village in Pithoragarh district of Kumaon hills, Uttarakhand in 1890. Service In the Army, Singh combined his love for music along with his service. He trained in classical and western music as well as ballad, brass band, string band and dance band. =British Indian Army= Singh earned the King George VI medal while serving in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa between 1937 and 1939. Promoted in 1941 to Company Havildar Major, he was sent to Singapore and Malaya with his unit during World War II. =Indian National Army= After the Fall of Singapore, the Japanese forces took a large number of POWs.

Singh later joined the Indian National Army as it was reorganised under the leadership of Bose. Subhas Chandra Bose was instrumental in tapping the talent of Captain Ram Singh as a dedicated music director. On his personal request, Singh composed the tunes for \\"Qadam Qadam Badaye Ja\\", the Indian National Army's (INA) marching song and now a noted patriotic song from India. He also composed the tune for \\"Subh Sukh Chain\\" (or the Qaumi Tarana as it was known), the national anthem to be adopted by Azad Hind. In 1944, Singh was decorated by Subhas Chandra Bose for his contributions. Singh also received a violin and a saxophone as gifts from Bose. =Return to India= After the end of the war, Singh was shipped back to India with his fellow soldiers. Imprisoned at the Kabul Lines of the Delhi Cantonment, Singh was released later as most of the INA troops were released without charge after widespread protests. Singh and members of his orchestra band were invited to play the National Anthem on the occasion of the Prime Minister's inaugural address to the nation at the Red Fort. Post 1947 Captain Ram Singh Thakuri (extreme right) playing the violin in Gandhi's presence, during one of Gandhi's visits to INA prisoners at Red Fort, 20 June 1946 Ram Singh was recruited in the 3rd Battalion PAC at Lucknow Uttar Pradesh in 1948 by Shri Jagdish Prasad Bajpai [Commandant ‚Äì 3rd Bn. PAC], and later was promoted as the Band Master in the Rank of Inspector. Thakur retired in 1974. Upon retirement he was accorded the honorary rank of DSP. He was known as \\"DSP Band UP Police\\" at the time of his retirement. He was honoured by the Central Government, as well as the Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Sikkim. Final years Captain Singh's final years were difficult and controversial, for which the Government drew much criticism.INA hero gets shabby treatment by government. The Tribune, 1 May 1999 He was initially denied the status of a freedom fighter by the government, while the State government of Uttar Pradesh later faced contempt proceedings for withholding the corresponding payment although the amount in question was meager. A controversial court petition at one point sought to establish that he was not the composer of the National Anthem. Captain Singh suffered an epilepsy attack in 2001, and after suffering ill health for nearly a year, died on 15 April 2002. He was cremated with State honours at Bhaisakund. However the State Government of Uttar Pradesh was again criticised for the absence of notable or prominent Government officials save a few police officers.

Built in 1781‚Äì1784, it is a high-quality and well- proportioned example of a wooden-frame Southern plantation house. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970. History The Wye forced- labor farm was created in the 1650s by a Welsh Puritan and wealthy planter, Edward Lloyd. Between 1780 and 1790, the main house was built by his great- great-grandson, Edward Lloyd IV, using the profits generated by the forced labor of enslaved people. It is cited as an example between the transition of Georgian and Federal architecture, which is attributed to builder Robert Key. Nearby the house is an orangery, a rare survival of an early garden structure where orange and lemon trees were cultivated, and which still contains its original 18th-century heating system of hot-air ducts. During its peak, the plantation's owners enslaved more than 1,000 people to work lands that totaled more than . Though the land has shrunk to today, it is still owned by the descendants of Edward Lloyd, now in their 11th generation on the property. Frederick Douglass was enslaved on the plantation, from around the ages of seven and eight, and spoke extensively of the brutal conditions of the plantation in his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. Modern situation The nearby hamlets of Unionville and Copperville are now home to many descendants of the people who were enslaved at Wye House. This has created an interesting dynamic, with the descendants of the enslavers and the enslaved living within a very short distance of one another. The Wye House plantation gained media attention in 2006 for archaeological investigations led by the University of Maryland. In 2011, excavation of the greenhouse, built by enslaved African people, brought a discovery of African charms laid to ward off bad spirits at the house's furnace and entrance.

Because of the expulsion of Lathers, Rickey, who was later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, was deprived of the services of the team's best batsman. =Professional baseball= Detroit Tigers coach Hughie Jennings (pictured) signed Lathers upon his expulsion from the University of Michigan. As soon as Lathers was expelled from Michigan, Detroit Tigers manager Hughie Jennings announced that Detroit had \\"first claim\\" on his services. Jenning said that he intended to take Lathers south for spring training and described Lathers as \\"an unusually promising player\\" whose \\"only fault\\" is base running, a skill at which Jennings was an expert teacher. After joining the Tigers for spring training, Lathers made the team and had his major league debut on May 1, 1910. Early in the 1910 season, Lathers was touted as a future star. The Washington Post in late May 1910 published Lathers‚Äô photograph with a caption describing him as \\"'Chick' Lathers, last year's star of the University of Michigan nine.\\" However, with Jim Delahanty, Donie Bush, and George Moriarty holding down the starting jobs at second base, shortstop and third base, Lathers did not find his way into Detroit's starting lineup. As a result, Lathers spent most of the 1910 season, as one newspaper put it, \\"on the Tiger bench learning the rudiments by observing.\\" Lathers played in 41 games for the 1910 Tigers, playing games at second base, shortstop and third base. He compiled a .230 batting average and .300 on-base percentage in 93 plate appearances during the 1910 season. In February 1911, Lathers returned to the Tigers for spring training. Press accounts suggested that, if the injured legs of Delahanty and Bush had healed, there was \\"no chance\\" of Lathers taking their starting spots. However, one newspaper opined that Lathers \\"is a much better batter than O'Leary and if he could learn some of the fine points of the game while South, would have the call\\" at second base. As the spring progressed, Detroit manager Hughie Jennings tried moving Lathers to first base to find a spot for him in the starting lineup. The press reported that Jennings planned to have both a right and left hand batting first baseman, with Del Gainer or Ness getting the start when a left-hander was pitching and Lathers getting the start against right-handers. In the end, Jennings moved Delahanty to first base in 1911, and Lathers saw even less playing time than he had in his rookie season. He played in only 29 games and compiled a batting average of .222 and an on-base percentage of .314 in 53 plate appearances. In 1912, Lathers tried for a regular position in the Tigers outfield, but failed to make the team. He was then shipped to the minor leagues by the Tigers to play with the Providence Grays in the International League. Lathers was joined in Providence by two other Detroit cast-offs, catcher Boss Schmidt and outfielder Delos Drake. By late July, newspapers reported that the three former Tigers playing in Providence were \\"fairly burning up the International League with their hitting.\\" At the time, Schmidt was hitting .364 and Drake .330. Lathers spent much of the 1912 season on the \\"sick list,\\" causing his batting average to slump, but by late July, his batting average had started to climb and stood at .304. In his two-year major league career, Lathers played in a total of 70 games, all with the Detroit Tigers. He played games at all four infield positions (22 games at 3rd base, 16 games at 2nd base, and 8 games at shortstop). He had a career batting average of .228 with a .305 on-base percentage. His lifetime fielding percentage of .906 was 32 points lower than the league average during his years of play, and his Range factor of 2.94 was 1.66 points lower than the league average of 4.59. =Military service and Ford Motor Company= In December 1912, Lathers was traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Indianapolis baseball team run by Mike Kelley. In return for Lathers, the Tigers were to have received Charley O'Leary‚Äîthe same player whose starting job Lathers had sought in 1911. Lathers was expected to play in the outfield for Indianapolis. However, in February 1913, the trade was cancelled after Lathers said he would not play baseball in 1913. It was reported that Lathers had quit baseball permanently to become an automobile salesman. Lathers reported that he was attached to the Kalamazoo, Michigan, store of the Ford Motor Company as a salesman. Lathers said of the new job that he \\"likes it so well he proposes to stick to it.\\" Lathers served in U.S. Army as an ordnance officer during World War I. After the war, Lathers returned to work at Ford Motor Company as a branch manager. =Dairy farmer and local politics= From 1925 to 1962, Lathers operated a dairy farm on the shores of Burt Lake (pictured). In 1925, Lathers bought property on Burt Lake at Indian Point (also known as Colonial Point). Lathers built a dairy barn, which was still standing in 2006, a sheep barn, chicken coop, icehouse and other buildings. Lathers' farm bottled and sold unpasteurized milk from \\"his prized Golden Guernseys.\\" He used giant chunks of ice cut from Burt Lake in winter to keep the milk chilled. For many years, Lathers also supplied the iceboxes of area resorters. Lathers continued to operate his dairy farm until 1962. Lathers was also active in local government. In 1945, Lathers was living in Petoskey, Michigan, and was one of the principal forces pushing a plan to raise $50,000 to partially finance the reconstruction of the inland water route from Cheboygan, Michigan, to Conway, Michigan. Lathers and a group of northern Michigan businessmen formed a non- profit corporation to raise the funds from local residents and tourists. Lathers believed the route, which was known as Michigan's \\"forgotten water route,\\" would promote tourism in northern Michigan. Lathers was also a longtime member of the Cheboygan County Road Commission. In 1953, he was elected chairman of the commission. He also served for a time as the head of the Michigan Association of Road Commissioners. =Later years= In 1962, Lathers sold his dairy farm. In his later years, he spent his winters in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Lathers died in 1971 at age 82 at Little Traverse Hospital in Petoskey, Michigan. He is buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Petoskey.

He studied at the √âcole de Dessin in Lyon under the French artist Donat Nonotte (1708‚Äì1785) and worked as a designer for the French wallpaper manufacturer Joseph Dufour et Cie (1752‚Äì1827) of M√¢con, France. In 1773, Charvet travelled to Guadeloupe in the Caribbean on business for his uncle, and stayed for four years producing many studies of native flora and fauna, as well as landscapes. By 1785, he had established a drawing school in Annonay, south of Lyon. Annonay had been a papermaking region since the Sixteenth Century. Charvet's reputation rests on twenty-panels of scenic wallpaper titled Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique (The Savages of the South Pacific) which combine to form a neoclassical depiction of the explorations of Captain James Cook.

The work was inspired by the exploration voyages of Captain James Cook between 1768 and 1779 and Jean Fran√ßois de La P√©rouse in 1785.Dufour notes in his prospectus that the tropic location represented in the artwork was based on Tahiti. Explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville described Tahiti as a natural paradise where its beautiful inhabitants lived in harmony and happiness. Bougainville stated in his account that ‚ÄúI never saw men better made, and whose limbs were proportionate‚Äù he also deifies the bodies of women as ‚ÄúVenus‚Ä¶the celestial form of that goddess‚Äù.

Exshar, 1772), 249. Following these expeditions, the Pacific captured the imagination of Europe and America and was the inspiration for literature, plays and images which reached a wide audience.One of the ways that images were circulated was through publications. One of the most popular was The Three Voyages of Captain James Cook which contained engravings created after John Webber‚Äôs original drawings. Accompanying this volume was an atlas which contained images of botanical specimens, landscapes and First Nations peoples. Images produced by official voyage artists like John Webber were engraved and published, inspiring other exotic Pacific depictions like the Tableau des decouvertes du Capne. Cook & de la Perouse by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur.Les Sauvages censors the violence present in the original drawings and etchings. It retains the scene of Captain James Cook's death in Hawaii but places it far in the background. Vivienne Webb, ‚ÄúVoyages,‚Äù in Les Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique, ed. Susan Hall (Australia: Thames and Hudson, 2000), 11. Similarities in the colour palette and figurative vignettes in Les Sauvages indicate that Saint-Sauveur's Tableau may have inspired the work.Webb, ‚ÄúVoyages,‚Äù 11. Primary sources, like the wallpaper's accompanying prospectus produced by Joseph Dufour in 1806, indicate that the subject of exploration and representations of the Pacific were very popular with a nineteenth century audience.Dufour in his prospectus indicates that it was easy to access information on the voyages to illuminate the imagery in Les Sauvages. He states ‚Äúwe must refer our readers to the abridged general history of the voyages by M. de la Harpe‚Ä¶ this book being easier to obtain than the original narratives of the explorers‚Äù. The reference to a book which was easier to obtain also supports the intention to appeal to a broad audience. The subjects for scenic wallpaper were chosen for commercial success, therefore we can comprehend that the Pacific was a popular subject at this time. Dufour, ‚ÄúLes Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique: tableau pour d‚Äô√©coration en papier peint,‚Äù 34. Nouvel-Kammerer, ‚ÄúReasons for Silence,‚Äù 23. The interest was encouraged by Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau‚Äôs notion of the noble savage and the Pacific as a moral utopian civilization.Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on the origin of inequality, trans. Donald A. Cress, (Indianapolis: Hackett Pub.Co., 1992). Les Sauvages perpetuates Rousseau‚Äôs stereotype, depicting homogenized races, living in harmony and peace.Edward Said has critiqued this type of homogenised racial depiction in his seminal text Orientalism. Edward Said, Orientalism, (New York: Random House, 1979). Les Sauvages also demonstrates another contradictory Enlightenment ideal of pride in man‚Äôs scientific innovations, indicated by the celebration of exploration. The depiction of the Pacific seen in Les Sauvages is typical of the period, celebrating progress and innovation as well as a nostalgia for an imagined utopian past. During the early nineteenth century there was a revival of the artistic style and ideals of the classical world, spurred by the excavation of sites like Pompeii in 1748 which uncovered stylised frescoes, mosaics and sculptures. Les Sauvages demonstrates this influence through its neoclassical style.The Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms describes characteristics of Neoclassicism as including balance, three dimensional forms, the illusion of depth and polished surface textures. ‚ÄúNeoclassicism,‚Äù Oxford Reference, accessed April 23, 2019, http://www.oxfordreference.com.virtual.anu.edu.au/view/10.1093/acref/9780191807671.001.0001/acref-9780191807671-e-956. ‚ÄúPompeii,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed May 1, 2019, https://www.britannica.com/place/Pompeii. This style can be seen in the illusion of depth created by the use of lighter shades of colour in the background, the balanced composition and the figures appearing rounded and flesh-like. The work imitates the natural world through the use of chiaroscuro, illustrating a light source which naturally illuminates and shadows the figures, fauna and the landscape. Les Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique was installed by the Francois-Emmanuel, vicomte de Toulongeon in 1804 in the parlour of his French Chateau which is now the Mus√©e departmental d‚Äôarts et traditions populaires, Champlitte Haute Saone. = Purpose and Popularity = Within Dufour‚Äôs prospectus, he articulates that the aim of the wallpaper was to provide aesthetic pleasure and education. Dufour notes that ‚Äúwithout leaving his apartment, a studious man reading the history of the voyages‚Ä¶ might think himself‚Ä¶ in the presence of the depicted people‚Äù.Dufour, ‚ÄúLes Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique: tableau pour d‚Äô√©coration en papier peint,‚Äù 33. This suggested value of education and self-improvement paired with commercial availability indicate that the intended clientele of Les Sauvages was middle class.Butler, ‚ÄúLes Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique: in England, America and Australia,‚Äù 16. Notably, the development of panoramic wallpaper was cheaper to produce and install than custom made tapestries or murals and thus was a more accessible form of wall decoration. Additionally, the Pacific motif was extremely popular and appealed to the fashions and philosophies of the time. Despite pedagogical intentions, it is clear from the neoclassical costumes, generalised setting and homogenized racial cultures that this wallpaper was developed to ‚Äúplease the eye‚Äù more than to convey an accurate depiction of the Pacific.Dufour stated his aim was ‚Äúto try and please the eye and to excited the imagination without taxing it‚Äù. This quote shows that the aesthetic quality of the work was tantamount. Dufour, ‚ÄúLes Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique: tableau pour d‚Äô√©coration en papier peint,‚Äù 33. The wallpaper was most commonly hung in shared or social spaces in the home like parlours.Nouvel-Kammerer, ‚ÄúReasons for Silence,‚Äù 25. This wallpaper was immediately popular and hundreds of copies were produced and sold to consumers in France, England and America. The depiction of native peoples from Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Alaska in Les Sauvages made it appealing to audiences internationally.The details of each panel are detailed below in the ‚ÄòPanel Descriptions‚Äô section. The success of this work marked the start of the fruitful panoramic scenic wallpaper industry, with Joseph Dufour & Cie and Zuber & Cie among the most prolific producers.Nouvel-Kammerer, ‚ÄúReasons for Silence,‚Äù 6. = Significance And Legacy = There has been significant interest in Les Sauvages throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Primarily, this was due to the acceptance of decorative arts as a high art form within art history. American scholar, interior designer and dealer Nancy McClelland was instrumental in reviving an engagement with the history of panoramic wallpapers and wrote extensively on Les Sauvages in the 1920s.McClelland also facilitated the collection of Les Sauvages and other examples of scenic wallpaper by major art institutions. Butler, ‚ÄúLes Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique: in England, America and Australia,‚Äù 18-19. Nancy McClelland, Historic Wallpapers, (America: Lippincott, 1924). Commercial exhibitions of panoramic wallpapers by French dealer Andr√© Carlhian and books written by Henri Clouzot also enhanced critical engagement with Les Sauvages.E.A. Entwisle, ‚ÄúJacquemart et B√©rnard and Other Makers,‚Äù in French scenic wallpapers 1800-1860, (London: F. Lewis Publishers Ltd, 1972), 51. The wallpaper as an unusual art form was previously overlooked in academia and was not acquired by museums. The scholars of this time researched the context of production, biographical details of the makers and aesthetic features.An interest in the production of the wallpaper is clear with several significant conservation assessments of the work published online from the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Australia.

A prominent exhibition was held at the Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs in Paris from 1990-1991 which sparked further interest in scenic wallpapers as a ‚Äúsocial mirror‚Äù reflecting the world of early nineteenth century France.The exhibition held at the Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs was titled Decors de l‚Äôimaginaire: Papiers peints panoramiques, 1790-1865.

Les Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique on display in the Auckland Museum amongst a display of works which pertain to the early European engagement with New Zealand. From the 1980s onwards Les Sauvages garnered significant appraisal within the Pacific region. This interest was due to the rise in popularity of postcolonial methodologies in art history and a reappraisal of colonial artefacts and histories. The emerging fascination of Les Sauvages in the Pacific can be easily traced by the acquisition of the work in state and national art museums in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii from the 1980s onwards.This interest is demonstrated by the acquisition of Les Sauvages by the National Gallery of Australia in 1983, the Bishop Museum of Honolulu in 1984, the Art Gallery of NSW in 1989 and the Auckland City Gallery in 1996. The most recent acquisition of the work was by Te Papa Tongarewa in New Zealand in 2016. Webb, ‚ÄúBiographical and catalogue notes,‚Äù 44-47. Les Sauvages has also inspired contemporary artists to create artworks which appropriate or subvert the inherent colonial gaze of the wallpaper.Other artists who have used the wallpaper as inspiration include Amy Sio-Atoa‚Äôs series Imagining Paradise: Embroidering Myth (2016) and Hawaiian- born artist Rachelle Dang‚Äôs Southern Oceans (2018). ‚ÄúImagining Paradise: Embroidering Myth,‚Äù Massey University, accessed April 23, 2019, https://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/8349/02_whole.pdf. ‚ÄúSouthern Oceans,‚Äù Rachelle Dang, accessed April 23, 2019, http://www.rachelledang.com/. The most prominent example is In Pursuit of Venus (2017) by New Zealand artist, Lisa Reihana.

This work attempts to challenge and disrupt colonial histories.

A man and two women are seated beneath a palm tree. People in middle distance of panels 18-19 are of Cape Maria van Diemen, New Holland (Australia) and Admiralty Islands. Jacques Julien Houton de la Billardi√®re visited the later in 1791‚Äì94 while searching for Marquis de La P√©rouse. * Panel 19: Inhabitants of Easter Island, which was allegedly discovered by the English buccaneer Captain John Davis in 1686 and visited by Cook in 1773. Two people in foreground are of Easter Island. * Panel 20: Inhabitants of Palau, where English sea captain Henry Wilson sailing on the Antelope was shipwrecked in August 1783. In foreground are King Aba-Thule and his wife Ludee, who returned to Europe with Wilson on a boat built in Palau. The Art Gallery of New South Wales (Australia), Historic Deerfield (Deerfield, Massachusetts), the Honolulu Museum of Art and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco usually have Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique on display. In 1995 the Mackelvie Trust acquired a significant panel from Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique - sections 15, 16 and 17 - which is held by the Auckland Art Gallery in Auckland, New Zealand. Trivia William Bligh of Mutiny on the Bounty fame was sailing master on HMS Resolution (depicted in panel 8), and explorer George Vancouver was a 21-year- old midshipman on HMS Discovery.

He was one of the most important figures in the scientific field in the colony in the second half of the seventeenth century. Background In 1613 he entered the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy. Scientific revolution For thirty years Father Rodr√≠guez maintained in his writing and teaching the separation of the exact sciences from metaphysics and theology. He tried to propound the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus without, in his writings, openly breaking with the scholastic tradition. He wrote on the astronomical findings of Galileo Galilei, but without directly endorsing them or attacking the classical cosmology. Nevertheless, these were radical steps, and the scientific community he headed in Mexico accepted them about 30 years before their colleagues in Spain. One reason for this surprising difference is that the books of modern science originating in Protestant countries were refused entry into Spain by the censors. Booksellers, in order not to lose their investments, often sent the contraband books on to America. Because of this aspect of Rodriguez's work, he was a target of Mexican Inquisition. Rodr√≠guez was at the center of a small circle of intellectuals that met semiclandestinely in private homes to discuss the new ideas. The 1640s, however, brought them to the attention of the Inquisition. A series of investigations and trials followed, continuing into the mid-1650s. A frantic hiding of books followed the Inquisition's 1647 edict imposing careful censorship on scientific works. In July 1655 the Inquisition required all Mexico City's booksellers (six) to submit their book lists to the Holy Office for approval, on pain of fine and excommunication.A Concise History of Mexico by Brian Hamnett Melchor P√©rez de Soto, one of the group of scientific modernizers headed by Diego Rodr√≠guez and chief architect at the cathedral, was subjected to the Inquisition. Thanks to this process, a catalog of his library, more than 1,660 volumes, has come down to us. Many of the works dealt with the modern science of contemporary Europe; many others had more traditional content. Works Rodr√≠guez wrote many works, some of them truly revolutionary contributions to mathematics (like his treatise on logarithms), astronomy and engineering. He also wrote treatises on technology, such as the one dealing with the construction of precise clocks. Many of these works were developed for his own courses in the university; others were written to support his own investigations. In the latter category is the report on the prediction and exact measurement of eclipses, which is fundamental for calculation of exact geographic positions (longitude), because the eclipse permits synchronization of the time with that in other geographic localities. This and his work on the improvement of clocks allowed him to measure the longitude of Mexico City with a precision greater than Alexander von Humboldt was able to make a century and a half later, even with improved methods. Rodr√≠guez's Peruvian student and correspondent, Francisco Ruiz Lozano, used the same technique to measure the position of his birthplace, Lima, Peru. Evaluation It is strange that the many valuable contributions of Rodr√≠guez and his students did not make a bigger impact on the history of the colony. His methods of calculating positions were not used by Spanish navigators, who could have benefited greatly from them. Most of his writings were never published, remaining in manuscript. In New Spain it was difficult to print them, not only because of high costs but also because special type faces were unavailable, for example, for mathematical symbols. And there was no market for the published works. For that reason some of his manuscripts were sent to Spain, but there was no greater interest there and they were ignored. At his death in 1668, most of his manuscripts were buried in the library of his order; the rest were dispersed in private collections or were irretrievably lost. Rodr√≠guez's successors in the chair of astronomy and mathematics occupied the position only briefly, and are of little interest, up until Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora took over the position in 1672.

It was formed on 26 November 1715 in Tarnogr√≥d by nobility angered by illegal taxation, levied for Saxon forces operating in Grand Duchy of Lithuania on behalf of Augustus II the Strong, who wanted to introduce absolute monarchy in the Commonwealth. Its marshal was Stanis≈Çaw Led√≥chowski. The confederates and the royal forces did not fight any decisive battles, but they fought numerous smaller skirmishes; several towns and castles were taken. The ensuing negotiations eventually brought Peter I of Russia and Russian Empire forces into the Commonwealth \\"for peacekeeping and mediation\\". This event marked the beginning of lasting Russian Empire influence on Commonwealth internal affairs, starting with the Silent Sejm of 1717.  Background  Augustus II the Strong of the Saxony's House of Wettin was elected to the throne of Poland in 1697. The Wettins, used to absolute rule, attempted to govern through intimidation and the use of force, which led to the a series of conflicts between Wettin supporters and opponents (including another pretender to the Polish throne, King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski). Those conflicts often took the form of the confederations ‚Äì legal rebellions against the king permitted under the Golden Freedoms. Augustus II wanted to strengthen the royal power in the Commonwealth; to reinforce his position, he brought in troops from Saxony (by the summer of 1714 more than 25,000 Saxon troops were inside Commonwealth's borders), which produced dissent in the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the Great Northern War, which marked the rise of the Russian Empire (1721), the growing conflict between Augustus II and the Polish nobility (szlachta) was used by the powerful Russian Tsar Peter the Great, victor of the Great Northern War. At that time, Russia was not yet strong enough to conquer and absorb the Commonwealth outright, nor could it easily and openly assume control of it, despite the Commonwealth's dysfunctional politics; the \\"Polish anarchy\\" was not be easily reigned. Hence Peter's goal was to weaken both sides, and prevent Augustus from strengthening his position, which he feared would lead to a resurgent Commonwealth that could threaten Russia's recent gains and growing influence in the Commonwealth internal politics. He further hoped and succeeding in forcing through conditions (such as reduction of the Commonwealth army's size) that would increase Commonwealth inferiority compared to Russia. Peter used Augustus II recent policies, aiming at the reduction of power of the hetmans (Polish-Lithuanian military commanders in chief), coinciding with the bad harvest and some Polish-French negotiations, to stir opposition to Augustus. Hostilities The nobles, spurred by Russian promises of support, formed the Tarnogr√≥d Confederation on 26 November 1715. The Confederation's marshal was Stanis≈Çaw Led√≥chowski. The Tarnogr√≥d Confederation was only the last and most notable of several confederations formed against Augustus at that time. The Confederates were supported by most of the Commonwealth's own army. Great Crown and Great Lithuanian Hetmans, Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski and Ludwik Konstanty Pociej, respectively, did not join the Confederation, but neither did they help the king. The Russians entered the country, but did not participate in any major engagements, and in fact they bid their time, as Peter posed as the conciliator between the Commonwealth king and the szlachta. Crucially, the Russians did not support the Confederates as promised, and instead insisted on bringing both sides to the negotiating table. The civil war lasted for a year; and the outcome hung in the balance. Saxon forces under command of Jacob Heinrich von Flemming enjoyed military superiority, and advanced south-eastwards, taking Zamo≈õƒá (this victory was however accomplished less through military tactics than through diplomacy and a treachery). In January, negotiations in Rawa Ruska led to a temporary ceasefire, but it did not hold, particularly as the Russians encouraged the Confederates to be more aggressive. The confederates pushed back against Augustus forces, entering Wielkopolska, and taking Pozna≈Ñ. They gained support from a local Wielkopolska confederation, and from Lithuania. Neither side was however posed to take victory, and the Russian pressure mounted; eventually the Russians declared that they will consider any side that does not enter negotiations an enemy and open hostilities with them. Unable to defeat the Confederates, many of whom still saw Peter as protector of their rights (and some of whom hoped for Augustus to be deposed), Augustus agreed to open the negotiations with Russians acting as arbitrators. Earlier, he hoped for the arbitration from the Pope, the Holy Roman Emperor or the Ottoman Empire, but the Pope was not trusted by the Confederates, and the Holy Roman Emperor and the Ottomans were concerned with hostilities between themselves. The Russians were represented by a delegation headed by prince Gregory Dolgoruky. Negotiations took place in June in Lublin, but were broken once again when the Confederates took Pozna≈Ñ, and the Saxons captured and executed one of the Confederation leaders, Miko≈Çaj ≈Åa≈õciszewski. In August, Augustus requested Russian assistance, and new round of negotiations begun. The defeat of the confederate forces in the battle of Kowalewo increased their will to negotiate. A peace treaty between Confederates and the Augustus was signed on 3 or 4 November 1716, as relations between the Confederates and the Russians deteriorated, as Russians made it increasingly apparent that their goals were not totally benign to the Commonwealth. Finally, a Sejm session was called for 1 February 1717. Aftermath and significance The Silent Sejm that was held in the aftermath of the hostilities gained notoriety in Polish history and politics. While some beneficial reforms were passed (such as the establishment of standing taxes for the military), the Sejm is regarded negatively by modern historians. Reduction of the army's size and establishment of Russia's position as the settlement guarantor reinforced Commonwealth military inferiority compared to its neighbors, and unofficially, put it in the position of a Russian protectorate. The Russian tsar as the guarantor had now a convenient excuse to intervene in Polish politics in the future at will. With a reduced army, removal of Saxon troops and the right to form confederations, the nobility and the king had less power to fight one another ‚Äì or, not incidentally, to resist the outside forces. Russian Army troops would stay in the Commonwealth for two years, supporting opposition to Augustus; and Russia soon reached an agreement with other powers about stopping further attempts to reform and strengthen the Commonwealth. Thus the Silent Sejm is regarded as one of the first precedences that the Russian Empire dictated Polish internal policy, and also as a precursor to the partitions of Poland, which erased the Commonwealth from world maps by 1795. Historian Norman Davies wrote that this Sejm \\"effectively terminated the independence of Poland and Lithuania\\". The system created by the Silent Sejm dominated the Polish political scene until the late 18th century, when a new wave of reforms led to the Constitution of 3 May 1791, soon followed by partitions of Poland and loss of Polish sovereignty for 123 years.

She served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and provided destroyer escort protection against submarine and air attack for Navy vessels and convoys. Post-war, she performed additional duties for the Navy, including those of a radar picket ship and a safety and support ship for Operation Deep Freeze. She was named in honor of ensign Lloyd Jones Mills who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross posthumously for his brave actions in the Aleutian Islands in 1942. She was laid down 26 March 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding Co., Houston, Texas; launched 26 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. James E. Mills; and commissioned 12 October 1943, Lt. Comdr. J. S. Muzzy, USCG, in command.  World War II North Atlantic operations After shakedown out of Bermuda, Mills trained nucleus crews for frigates and destroyer escorts off Norfolk, Virginia, until 10 January 1944 when she began transatlantic convoy escort duty. On her second voyage into the Mediterranean, Mills' convoy was attacked before dawn 1 April 1944, 56 miles west of Algiers by German torpedo bombers. SS Jared Ingersoll, a Liberty ship, was hit and set blazing. Mills picked up survivors who had abandoned ship, and sent a boarding party to extinguish her fires. British tug HMS Mindfull and Mills then towed Jared Ingersoll to Algiers.  Transferred to the Pacific Ocean  By V-E Day, for which she was moored at Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mills had completed nine voyages on escort duty to the Mediterranean, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and France. Mills left New York City 30 May 1945 for the Panama Canal and Adak, Alaska, arriving 8 July. She served there as weather station, plane guard, and escort between Alaskan ports until sailing 20 August for occupation duty, arriving 9 September at Ominato Ko, Honsh≈´. Briefly returning to Alaska 25 September to 17 November, Mills steamed west again to operate out of Taku and Tuington, China, until 11 February 1946. Returning to the States via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal, she arrived Charleston, South Carolina, 22 March, sailed 25 April for Green Cove Springs, Florida, and decommissioned 14 June to go into reserve.  Converted to Radar Picket Ship  Eleven years later, after installation of additional radar and electronic equipment and enlargement of her superstructure at Boston Naval Shipyard, Mills was reclassified DER-383 and recommissioned 3 October 1957, Lt. Comdr. Joseph E. Feaster in command. Assigned as a radar picket of the North American Continental Air Defense System to deter surprise attack by locating and reporting aircraft headed toward North America, Mills sailed 3 April 1958 from Newport, Rhode Island, for Argentia, Newfoundland, to begin her first picket. She made 17 subsequent 3 to 4-week pickets on the barrier stretching from Newfoundland to the Azores through 28 July 1961, as well as one off the southeast coast of the United States. Between 28 August 1961 and the end of 1963, Mills served primarily on the new Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom Barrier designed to extend protection to the NATO allies.  Supporting Operation Deep Freeze  In 1964, Mills was assigned to Operation Deep Freeze, the U.S. Naval Force supporting scientific research in Antarctica. During the austral summer seasons of 1964‚Äì65, and 1966‚Äì67, and 1967‚Äì68, Mills took station to provide weather information and electronic navigational aid to aircraft ferrying men and equipment between Christchurch, New Zealand, and McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Each of these seasonal deployments required an 11,000-mile voyage via the Panama Canal to Dunedin, New Zealand, Mills' base of operations with \\"Deep Freeze\\". At the end of each deployment, Mills completed a round the world cruise by returning to Newport, Rhode Island, via the Suez Canal. In 1965, when she did not serve with \\"Deep Freeze\\", Mills was underway school ship off Florida. On 3 September 1968, Mills became an operational Naval Reserve training ship at Baltimore, Maryland.  Awards  Mills received one battle star for World War II service.
