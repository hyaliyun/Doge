Structure = Markers = Islet resident macrophages are uniquely found within the endocrine tissue (islet), while nearby in the nearby acinar tissue, macrophages express a different repertoire of CD (cluster of differentiation) markers and come from a different developmental origin. In terms of expression markers, islet macrophages are positive for; F4/80, CD11b, CD11c, MHC-II, CD64, CD68, LyzM (lysozyme), Cx3cr1 and are negative for; CD206 (mannose receptor), CD301, CD103. =Development= The mesoderm gives rise to myeloid progenitor cells, which further differentiate into macrophage populations. As opposed to macrophages in the islet stroma (tissue), whose developmental origin is from the yolk sac (primitive hematopoiesis), islet resident progenitors come from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the definitive hematopoiesis. These cells are seen in fetal liver during mid-gestation E10-E11, and are thought to colonize the bone marrow during late gestation E15. As a unique population in terms of developmental origin, these resident macrophages have a unique phenotype in which they are long lived, self-renew locally, and stay confined within the islet parenchyma.  Function  Islet resident macrophages depend on the expression of colony stimulating factor (CSF1). Knockout mice for the CSF-1 gene cause islets to be devoid of resident macrophages. These mice show a reduced beta cell mass as well as developmental defects. This as well as other observations, showing that islet resident macrophages promote beta cell proliferation suggest that islet macrophages are likely important contributors to the function of the pancreatic islet. In contrast to the possible supportive role within the islet, these specialized macrophages are also required for the initiation of the adaptive immune response during type 1 diabetes (T1D) in mice. They do this by presenting beta cell derived peptides using MHC II receptors to T-cells in the islet. Once activated, T-cells stimulate the adaptive immune system, which leads to the destruction of pancreatic islets due to an autoimmune response.  History  The islet resident macrophage was first identified in 1979 as an antigen-presenting cell (APC), which expresses major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Later in 1984 this APC was further classified by using a macrophage specific marker F4/80. In 1988 it was discovered that macrophages play an essential role in the progression of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (T1D), in an animal model for non-obese diabetes (NOD mice). The role of pancreatic macrophages were later shown to play an important role in type 2 diabetes as well, by contributing to islet inflammation. The origin and turnover in the normal state was characterized by Emil Unanue in 2015.

She was the first woman admitted to practise as a professional lawyer in the UK when, in 1920, she qualified as a solicitor in Scotland.  Life  Anderson was born on 24 April 1896 in Glasgow to Anne Catherine Chisholm (1864‚Äì1947), daughter of an Inverness bookseller, and Robert Easton Anderson (1865-1932), a surgical instrument maker. From 1904 to 1913 she attended Hutcheson's Grammar School, going on to study at the University of Glasgow. She graduated with an MA in 1916, a BL in 1919 and an LLB in 1920. She was the first woman to graduate from the University with a degree in law. She was not however the first female law graduate in Scotland: Eveline MacLaren and Josephine Gordon Stuart graduated from the Faculty of Law at the University of Edinburgh some years earlier, but at that time women were prohibited from practising as lawyers. On 12 May 1917 she began working as an apprentice law agent at the practice of Maclay Murray & Spens. In 1920, Anderson was the first woman to be admitted to the legal profession in the United Kingdom following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, when she was admitted as a law agent in Scotland (the Scottish Law Agents Society was formed in 1884; the Law Society of Scotland was not created until 1949). Her application for admission as a law agent was initially refused, because the necessary three years of training began before the passing of the Act, and her indenture of training was not properly registered ‚Äî registration was refused in 1917 because she was a woman. She appealed to the Court of Session, and her petition was reported to the Inner House, First Division, and heard in December 1920, by the Lord President, Lord Mackenzie, Lord Skerrington and Lord Cullen. The opinion of the Lord Ordinary Lord Ashmore criticised the English terminology used in the Act, but concluded that she was entitled to have her petition granted, and the court upheld her appeal.[1921] SLT 48 In 1922 Anderson was working at the Glasgow law firm John Steuart and Gillies, where she stayed for five years before establishing her own practice in Giffnock in Glasgow. She was articled in London, with legal partners Edith Annie Berthen and Beatrice Honour Davy. They had established the first legal firm run by women in 1931. In 1937 she became the first woman qualified to practice as a solicitor in both England and Scotland, after passing the English Law Society final exam. She then joined Berthen and Davy as a partner in the expanded law firm. In 1949 she purchased a house near Dunkeld in Perthshire which she ran as a private hotel for some years, before moving first to a cottage near Crieff and then to Bankfoot. However, the details of her later life remain obscure. Anderson died at the Royal Infirmary, Perth, on 9 August 1982.

Service history Illustration of L√ºft-√º Celil exploding, after having been hit by Russian artillery fire L√ºft-√º Celil, meaning \\"Divine Grace\\", was ordered from the Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in Bordeaux in 1867 and was laid down the following year. The ship had originally been ordered by the Khedivate of Egypt, an autonomous tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, but Egyptian efforts to assert their independence angered Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, who, on 5 June 1867, demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, the vessel was formally transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 29 August 1868. She was launched in 1869 and completed for sea trials in 1870. The ship was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet in March that year. Upon completion, L√ºft-√º Celil and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869.

L√ºft-√º Celil was assigned to the II Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. In 1875, the ship received a single gun manufactured by Krupp. The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to begin to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. At the start of the war, L√ºft-√º Celil and Hifz-ur Rahman were assigned to the Danube Squadron, where they were tasked with preventing Russian forces from crossing the river. On 11 May, while cruising in the Danube off Izmail, the ship was attacked by Russian artillery consisting of mortars and 25-pounder rifled guns. One of the shells struck the vessel, probably in the boiler room, where it caused a large explosion that destroyed the ship. The river monitor picked up twenty men, but most of her crew, some 160 officers and men, were killed in the explosion.

It follows a writer's attempt to describe a metamorphosis he went through two decades earlier, when he stopped being confrontative and instead became a passive observer. The task proves to be difficult and most of the book is instead concerned with the lives of the narrator, his family and the people in the Paris suburb where he lives. The book is 1066 pages long in its original German. It was published in English in 1998, translated by Krishna Winston. Reception Volker Hage of Der Spiegel compared the book to works by Botho Strau√ü, as both Strau√ü and Handke use literature to reflect on the activity of writing. Hage wrote that My Year in the No-Man's-Bay may be described as \\"postmodern literati-literature\\", something critics have anticipated with horror, but continued: \\"What does such a label matter, when the prose is as intense as relaxed, as surprising as obvious, as beautiful as original\\". When the English translation was published in 1998, Publishers Weekly's critic wrote: \\"Despite attaining moments of stylistic lucidity worthy of Montaigne, the narrator more often comes across as gloomy and hostile. Nonetheless, numerous trenchant moments of insight make this work intriguing and provocative.\\" Lee Siegel reviewed the book for The New York Times. He described it as \\"one carefully observed image after another expanding into a cinematically eternal present tense\\", which according to Siegel means that \\"in a sense, then, Handke's novel is an argument for the superiority of film to the novel\\". The critic continued: \\"Though at times intellectually bracing, this can make for pretty arid reading. And Handke's attempts at elevating his epic of self-regarding banality often make matters worse. Rejecting character, plot and psychology as mere fictions, he relies on an ostentatious thematic framework that winds up being more implausible than any old-fashioned novelistic trick.\\" Publishers Weekly called the English translation \\"impeccable\\", while Siegel called it \\"clumsy and overliteral\\".

Formation Formed in 2006 in Co Tyrone Northern Ireland by Phil Conalane and Kie McMurray. Conalane, Andrew Mackle and McMurray were musicians, playing in various cover bands in Northern Ireland before deciding to collaborate on writing of original material drawing from their shared musical interests. The results were soon recorded and formed the basis of Million Dollar Reload's first EP, 'Needle, Blackout, Fly'. Drummer Davy Cassa was then recruited for purposes of the recording sessions before eventually being invited to join as a full-time member of Million Dollar Reload. Brian Mallon was recruited by McMurray as a second guitarist for live performances of the band's new, original material; he would become a full-time member. Before starting the recording of their debut album, Million Dollar Reload were recruited (minus drummer Cassa) by Steven Adler of Guns N' Roses as his backing band in his post Guns N' Roses career playing under Adler's Appetite. The band performed with Adler in Ireland after he had fired his own band during the European leg of their 2006 tour. This proved to be the catalyst for Million Dollar Reload to enter the studio speedily and begin the recording process for their debut album. Anthems Of A Degeneration Anthems of a Degeneration was recorded at Manor Park Studios in Northern Ireland, and produced by Neal Calderwood. Anthems of a Degeneration was initially a self- released record, only available in physical format, online via the Million Dollar Reload website. After two years of continued sales, the record was picked up by Powerage Records in the UK and re-released in 2010. This point proved to be a major turning point for the band who were quickly offered a release in Japan on Hydrant/Universal Records. In the summer of 2011 drummer Cassa was fired after five years playing in the band. Cassa was replaced by Sean McKernan. Several high-profile support slots followed, most notably for Alice Cooper and later for The Darkness in the Ulster Hall, Belfast. The promotion of Anthems of a Degeneration continued with a UK club tour, followed by a 10 date US tour. On returning to the UK, Million Dollar Reload spent the summer of 2012 playing a number of festivals, most notably Download Festival and Bloodstock. At this point, Million Dollar Reload were being managed by ex- Sanctuary Management manager Dave Thorne who previously worked with Helloween, Arch Enemy and Bruce Dickinson. Thorne has been credited by Jon Bon Jovi for substantially helping Bon Jovi achieve international success while Thorne was marketing manager on Slippery When Wet. Thorne continued to manage Million Dollar Reload for the remainder of their career and change of name. A Sinner's Saint A Sinner's Saint was recorded in 2011, again at Manor Park Studios under producer Neal Calderwood. by which time Finn O'Hagain had replaced McKernan on drums following his departure from the band. Frontiers Records signed Million Dollar Reload in 2012 and subsequently released A Sinner's Saint worldwide in July of the same year. UK tours and several European festival and club shows followed, including support to Koritni & Black Rain at The Bataclan, Paris. For a period Conalane was touted in the media as the new singer for US rockers Velvet Revolver after the departure of Scott Weiland. Conalane always denied that an approach by Velvet Revolver had been made. As Real As It Gets Million Dollar Reload were dropped by Frontiers Records in 2014 after a refusal by the label to release their newly recorded live album As Real As It Gets, recorded at a club show in Northern Ireland. Million Dollar Reload self-released the album on their own label, Bulletproof 20/20 Records, in 2014. A pivotal European tour followed as support to Atlanta based southern rockers Blackberry Smoke on their 'Fire in the Hole' tour. Andrew Mackle unexpectedly quit midway through the tour. Million Dollar Reload finished the tour as a four piece before returning to Northern Ireland to reassess their future as Million Dollar Reload. The band continued for a short time with Conalane taking up second guitar duties while a suitable replacement was found. A short time thereafter, Piano/Hammond organ player Kevy Brennan was recruited to Million Dollar Reload as the band transitioned from hard rock band to a more laid back rock-n-roll style throughout 2015. Change of name A decision was made that given their change in members and musical style, Million Dollar Reload would benefit from a name change to move the project forward. Million Dollar Reload became Blackwater Conspiracy, with a surprise announcement during a gig at the Belfast Empire in August 2015, when the band announced to the fans from the stage that the time had come to reveal the future of the band. A new backdrop and logo design was unveiled and a new chapter started with a selection of new material being performed. Blackwater Conspiracy went to Rockfield Studios, Wales in 2016 to record the band's first album as Blackwater Conspiracy. This album, Shootin' The Breeze, was released in June 2017.

Hifz-ur Rahman was stationed at the port of Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, along with the ironclads and . The ships were tasked with defending the seaward approach to the port, supporting three coastal fortifications. Starting in November, a Russian flotilla of small vessels attempted to lay a minefield off Sulina to block the Ottoman vessels. After the ironclad drove off the minelayers on 8 November, the Russians returned with mortar-equipped gunboats the next day. In the ensuing engagement, Hifz-ur Rahman was hit once by a shell that struck one of her boilers, forcing her to withdraw. The ship was laid up in Constantinople in 1878; she did not see further activity for the next twenty years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Hifz-ur Rahman was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . Hifz-ur Rahman was modernized at the Imperial Arsenal between 1891 and 1894. Her armament was significantly revised; her two original 229 mm guns were removed. In their place, she received Krupp guns, and four Hotchkiss guns and two Nordenfelt guns were also added. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Hifz-ur Rahman was assigned to the II Squadron. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Hifz-ur Rahman, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews are poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. During these operations, Hifz-ur Rahman were stationed at Morto Bay at the mouth of the Dardanelles, while the rest of the ironclads remained safely inside the straits. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. Hifz- ur Rahman was not included in the program, and instead she was decommissioned in 1909 and placed on the disposal list on 31 July.

History It was founded by Petronilla of Lorraine, regent of Holland, in 1133 and was thereafter under the protection of the countesses of Holland. The abbey only accepted female members of the nobility as members. It became the most prestigious women's religious house in Holland and grew very wealthy on donations during the centuries.

An old Benedictine monastery, Pope Paul VI elevated it in 1973 to the rank of Minor Basilica. The first true knowledge about the foundation of the abbey dates back to a document from the late 11th century, probably from the scriptorium of the monastery of Gladbach. This richly illuminated document reports that a nobleman long before the founding of the abbey would have erected a church on the top of the hill, a church destroyed by the Magyars in 954. In 1120, at the latest, the monastery was affected by the Benedictine reform Siegburg. It was between 1228 and 1239 the nave of the abbey took its definitive form. Between 1256 and 1277, while reconstruction was developing, the idea of building a new choir appeared, but on a different plane (the typical elongated choir of the Gothic style). In order to carry out this plan, Master Gerhard, the first architect of Cologne Cathedral brought to his experience. Albert the Great consecrated the abbey on April 28, 1275.

She was a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College and also worked as a senior researcher at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the University of California, Berkeley. Rubin was a feminist.  Biography  Rubin was born in Philadelphia, and her parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father died when she was five. Rubin and her brother moved to New York after her father died where Rubin's mother worked in the garment industry. The family grew up poor, and her mother was abusive, and often told Rubin that \\"Girls shouldn't be born.\\" Rubin graduated high school at age fifteen and was hired as a secretary, a job her family saw as \\"a high achievement.\\" Another reason she started working was so that she could help contribute money for her brother to go to college. Her mother had emphasized that girls \\"marry up,\\" while boys should go to college. Rubin got married when she was nineteen, and had a daughter, Marci. Her first marriage was to an accountant, Seymour Katz. She and her new family moved to Los Angeles in 1952 where she worked as a manager for progressive congressional campaigns. Rubin managed Norman Martell's and Jerry Pacht's congressional campaigns. She and her husband divorced in 1959. She married Hank Rubin in 1962 and together they moved to the Bay Area. In 1963, Rubin went back to school. Rubin and her daughter attended University of California, Berkeley at roughly the same time, with Rubin earning her bachelor's degree in 1967 and then her masters in 1968. She earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in sociology in 1971. After earning her degrees, she practiced as a private therapist and continued her sociology research. Rubin would spend the rest of her career between both of these fields, \\"never completely fitting into either.\\" Her work marked her as one of the first feminists to use intersectionality. In 1973, she was a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College. Rubin worked as a senior research associate at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at UC Berkeley in 1977. In 1992, she was given an honorary doctorate of humane letters by the State University of New York. Rubin's husband, Hank, died in 2011 after living with dementia for a decade. Rubin died in her bed of natural causes in 2014.  Work  Rubin wrote several non-fiction books and was a contributor to Salon. She had several best sellers, including Just Friends (1985), Intimate Strangers (1983) and Women of a Certain Age (1979). She also appeared on television to discuss her work and books, such as appearing on the Donahue show. Rubin's 1976 book, Worlds of Pain: Life in the Working Class Family describes the daily drudgery in the life of \\"the average worker.\\" These workers were defined as \\"intact families with neither spouse having more than a high school education,\\" with the husband working manual labor and having at least one child under 12 living at home. Rubin's study was based on her experience with 50 working class couples in the Bay Area. She conducted over 100 interviews with the husbands and wives separately. Rubin also highlights how many working mothers not only had their jobs to contend with, but also the sexist attitude that housework was women's work. The book was considered by the Library Journal to be of interest to both general readers and students of sociology. Worlds of Pain also served as a reminder to middle-class, white feminists that working-class women had been largely forgotten in second-wave feminism. Women of a Certain Age (1979), looks at middle age from a woman's perspective and relies interviews from 160 different women for the narrative. Rubin found that many women who had lived the first half of their lives as dependents on their husband's income often had difficulty transitioning and becoming more independent. The book helps dispel some stereotypes about middle age, like the idea that middle-aged people have less interest in sex, and that women experience an \\"empty nest syndrome\\" when their children leave home. Rubin addressed couples in Intimate Strangers: What Goes Wrong in Relationships Today - And Why (1983) which found that men often considered their wives their best friends and needed them for emotional support. Rubin felt that it was important to examine not just the emotions and problems of women, but also to get into what men are thinking. She said, \\"I'm trying to do what hasn't been done before. I want to explain men, not as male chauvinist pigs or power-hungry people, but as comprehensible individuals.\\" Rubin continued to write about women in Just Friends (1985), which primarily examines female friendship. Rubin described many different types of friendships and how these could change over time as women's roles changed. She interviewed 300 men and women which she used to create the book. Her assessment of men's friendship is that it is more akin to bonding, but not as intimate as what women experience. Rubin wrote Quiet Rage: Bernie Goetz in a Time of Madness (1986) after the 1984 New York City Subway shooting. The book rejects vigilantism and is critical of Goetz's actions. While promoting the book, she found that she had \\"tapped into a huge reservoir of anger and hostility when she suggested on radio talk shows that the gunman had not, after all, done a good thing,\\" according to The Washington Post. Rubin found that people continued to support incorrect facts about the case even after having the truth brought forward. In the book, she used letters written to newspapers to show the public's attitude towards the black teenagers who were involved in the incident. The Los Angeles Times called it \\"an important book on an American dilemmathe urban fear of crime and its devastating impact on race relations.\\" Her book, Erotic Wars (1991), explores through interviews with 375 adults, sexuality and sexual behavior in America. Rubin found that many sexual problems between heterosexual partners occurred because Americans still felt that sex was a very taboo subject. She also found that many Americans had unrealistic expectations about their sexual partners. Another finding that was she discovered that most Americans did not curtail sexual activity in response to the AIDS crisis, but rather used it as an excuse to slow down their sexual activity. Families on the Fault Line (1994) is a work that describes the way that race and class are \\"so intimately intertwined in U.S. society that one often serves as a proxy for the other. Rubin again turns to the working-class in this book and the economic insecurity that many people are facing. She conducted around 400 interviews with working-class people from different racial and ethnic groups to create the book. Her 2003 book, The Man With the Beautiful Voice, describes some of her experiences as a psychotherapist. In the book, she talks about how psychotherapy is practiced and how it can be reformed. She describes several of her own cases, both the success stories and her own failures. Rubin's book about aging, 60 On Up (2007), uses her own experiences and the interviews with other senior citizens to describe the challenges aging brings to people today.

During the 16th-century, the abbey played an important political role under its abbess Amalberga Vos: it was a center of religion and charity, and was in 1544 given status as a refuge for religious dissidents, housing many important people during a time of religious persecution.Kees Kuiken, Vos, Amalberga, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

In 1572, the abbess relocated the nuns to Gent, and the abbey was de facto no longer active in Axel: there were plans to return in the 1570s, but nothing came of it.

In March 1963, Austin and Great Scott defeated Buddy Rogers and Johnny Barend for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship (northeast version). During their reign, the Capitol Wrestling Corporation withdrew from the NWA, and the championship was renamed the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship. In May 1963, Austin and Great Scott were defeated for the championship by Brute Bernard and Skull Murphy. At this time, Austin was one of the major challengers to WWWF Champion Buddy Rogers. Austin subsequently travelled to Ottawa, where later that month he won a tournament for the vacant Canadian Heavyweight Championship.

The temple of St. John was administered at the time of the Reformation by a noble Protestant and only one chapel, the chapel of St. John, was assigned to those who remained faithful to the Catholic faith. In the eighteenth century, under the French government of Louis XIV, the Catholic population grew. Next, they financed the construction of a Basilica, which was the only religious building built on the site for a hundred years. The Basilica of St. John was built on the site of the chapel of the same name by the architect Friedrich Joachim Stengel between 1754 and 1758. The Basilica was remodeled, destroyed and restored several times. The interior has been redesigned according to the original baroque between 1972 and 1975. The Basilica obtained its present name by a decision of Pope Paul VI, who made it a Basilica. The Basilica is part of a parish with five churches . In addition to Catholic masses, organ concerts are regularly held.

Here, the term \\"tail\\" means those terms in the sequence that are not among the N largest terms, for an arbitrary natural number N. Stechkin's lemma is often useful when analysing best-N-term approximations to functions in a given basis of a function space. The result was originally proved by Stechkin in the case q = 2. Statement of the lemma Let 0 < p < q < infty and let I be a countable index set. Let (a_{i})_{i in I} be any sequence indexed by I, and for N in mathbb{N} let I_{N} subset I be the indices of the N largest terms of the sequence (a_{i})_{i in I} in absolute value. Then :left( sum_{i in I setminus I_{N}}  a_{i} ^{q} right)^{1/q} leq left( sum_{i in I}  a_{i} ^{p} right)^{1/p} frac{1}{N^{r}} where :r = frac{1}{p} - frac{1}{q} > 0. Thus, Stechkin's lemma controls the ‚Ñìq norm of the tail of the sequence (a_{i})_{i in I} (and hence the ‚Ñìq norm of the difference between the sequence and its approximation using its N largest terms) in terms of the ‚Ñìp norm of the full sequence and an rate of decay.

Pritzker, $225M was appropriated to begin this service. History Until 1979, the Rock Island Railroad's Quad Cities Rocket, served the Quad Cities. However, due to poor on-time performance and deteriorating track conditions, ridership declined substantially, causing the state of Illinois to pull the subsidy keeping the train running, leaving the Quad Cities without passenger rail service. In 2008, efforts to restore passenger rail service to the Quad Cities were set in motion. In 2010, the City of Moline got a federal TIGER grant for construction of the station. However, in early 2015, Governor Bruce Rauner put all major spending projects under review, including the Chicago-Quad Cities Amtrak line, on hold. Despite this, construction on the station started in 2015, and continued throughout the period the line's future was in question. By June 2016, under threat of losing the federal funding for the line, the state released the matching funds needed to move the project forward.

The church consists of a room of worship with a single apse, which had to be very richly adorned, as evidenced by the ornamental reliefs that remained in the present northern aisle of the temples. The remains (not visible) of the mural paintings of the Carolingian period show that the walls of the church originally had a great artistic wealth. However, after two fires the backbone of the temple collapsed around 1080 and in the ancient foundations, maintaining the original measurements, a basilica was built without a transept.

Biography Cottrell was born Mary Ellen Bryan in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the daughter of Richard and Maria Bryan (n√©e Tester). She became a school teacher and eventually headmistress. In 1896, she married Frank Cottrell at Ecclesall Bierlow, Yorkshire. They set up home in Birmingham, where three sons were born: Frank in 1897, Wilfred in 1902, and Norman Bryan in 1907. She was active in the local co-operative movement, serving as secretary of the local Women's Guild, and was elected to the board of the Ten Acres and Stirchley Co- operative Society (TASCOS) in 1909 as the first woman to serve in that role. She was also the first woman to represent the Midlands on the Co-operative Union's Central Board in 1917. She is credited with getting wartime rations of milk increased for infants and nursing and expectant mothers while serving on the Milk Advisory Board in 1918. On 6 February 1917, she was elected unopposed to Birmingham City Council at a by-election for Selly Oak caused by George Shann's elevation to alderman. Her selection as the Labour Party candidate was controversial at the time; as at least two local trade union officers had hoped to be selected. She was the first female Labour councillor to serve on the City Council. She was introduced to her first Council meeting by Cllr Thomas Hackett as having rendered great service to the Labour movement in Selly Oak and as having had considerable experience in public work. Her election pre-dated the launch of the Co-operative Party by some months, but from 1920 she stood as a Labour/Co-op candidate. Cottrell stood for re- election in 1920, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate. She returned to the Council in December 1921 at a by-election and served until 1923. In 1922, she became the first woman elected to the Board of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, where she was to be the only woman director for 37 years. She stepped down from the Council to concentrate on her co-operative work. In the 1939 Register, Cottrell is shown as living in the same house in Oak Tree Lane, Selly Oak as when she was elected. She is described as widowed, and as \\"Director CWS (Retired)\\". She died in Birmingham at the age of 101.

It was laid out in the late 18th century and was named after the Powis brothers, who developed most of the land in this part of the town.Bedford (2014), p. 44. The street has been rebuilt several times but has retained some notable examples of late- Victorian and Art Deco architecture.  Location  Powis Street is situated in central Woolwich, to the south of, and more or less parallel to the main thoroughfare, the A206 dual carriageway, locally known as Woolwich High Street and Beresford Street. The western end of the street meets the South Circular Road (A205) at Parson's Hill. At its eastern end are the town's two main squares, Beresford Square and General Gordon Square. This is also where Woolwich Arsenal railway and DLR stations are situated and where the future Crossrail station is being built. Since the pedestrianisation of the street, busses are only allowed to pass through a small section of the street but there are many busstops in the vicinity, mostly around the stations. A large multi-storey carpark exists in Monk Street / Calderwood Street. Other car parks are available at the west end of Powis Street and in Macbean Street.  History  = 18th century = Up to the late 18th century, the military and naval town of Woolwich was largely situated along the High Street, and to the north of that street along the banks of the river Thames, crammed in between Woolwich Dockyard and The Warren (later the Royal Arsenal). Most shops in Old Woolwich would have been along the High Street, with a market at Market Hill (near Bell Water Gate). After numerous redevelopments, very little of historic value remains here. Powis Street as a dirt road, from the east. Paul Sandby, 1783 The same dirt track from the west, with the octagonal building The area that presently forms the commercial heart of Woolwich - south of Old Woolwich, around Powis Street, Beresford Square and General Gordon Square - was still largely rural, with a small cluster of cottages around Green's End and the so- called New Road (Woolwich New Road). To the north and east of the future Powis Street were the Royal Ropeyard and some gardens; to the south and west lay virgin land. As the town was growing rapidly - from 6,500 in 1720 to almost 17,000 in 1811 - the need arose for a new town centre and the obvious location was the area south of the ropeyard, more or less between the old town and the main entrance of the Arsenal.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 190. In 1782, the Powis brothers, Greenwich brewers, took a lease of 43 acres of these fields which were then part of the Bowater Estate.The Powis brothers, William, Thomas and Richard, were Greenwich beer brewers who also in 1782 took over the Dog Yard brewery and a number of public houses around Woolwich. William moved to Woolwich and became a member of the Vestry in 1784. Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 191. Shortly afterwards a road was laid out here. It connected Green's End and the parish church of St Mary Magdalene, providing an alternative to the busy High Street. The artist Paul Sandby, who lived in Woolwich, painted the road in its earliest appearance. A watercolour of 1783 shows the road from Green's End as no more than a dirt track. Another watercolour by Sandby shows the same area from the west with the ropeyard clearly visible to the north of the road. An octagonal house stood at its west end (where the Art Deco co-op building stands now), perhaps an outbuilding of the Dog Yard brewery on the High Street, or a lavoir. A laundress lived there in 1841. In 1853 it was demolished. As the lease that the Powis brothers took out was only for 22 years, the land was not profitable for development and, apart from the road, very little happened until 1799, when a 99-year development lease was signed. Plans were made to fill in the entire area of 43 acres with streets and houses. In fact, work had already started in 1798. In less than 30 years the project would be completed, presenting Woolwich with a municipal precinct, the area now known as Bathway Quarter, and a new shopping precinct, the Powis and Hare Street area.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 190-191. = 19th century = The Powis estate in 1825 The development of the Powis estate went smoothly during the Napoleonic Wars, because in Woolwich wartime brought prosperity. In 1810 there were already 141 houses in Powis Street. The long period of peace after the Battle of Waterloo brought hardship and population decline. Powis Street (along with Hare Street, then Richard Street) was in 1821 the first street to be finished, with a total of 158 houses built. Most houses were two storeys high, occasionally three. The narrowest frontages measured 4.3 m. Some were put up by shipwrights from Woolwich Dockyard, and then sub-leased. From the beginning there were shops in Powis Street. After rebuilding Kent House in the 1830s, Garrett's, a draper's, was the largest shop. There were also several chapels, a Freemasons' hall, a theater and a number of public houses, two of which, the Shakespeare and the Star & Garter, were owned by the Powis brothers. In the late 1840s around 1,000 people lived in Powis Street. Most shops were at the east end of the street, close to Woolwich market and the railway station, which opened in 1849. At this time Woolwich was already considered \\"the emporium for all the surrounding towns and villages\\". Compared to the High Street, Powis Street shops were smart and fashionable.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 191-198. In 1827 Henry Hudson Church was born in Powis Street. Church became a prominent architect and surveyor in Woolwich. In the early 1860s he laid out new streets in the area between Powis Street and the Bathway Quarter, where the railway had cut through. The streets were all named after members of the Powis family: Monk Street, Clara Place and Eleanor Road (now Barnard Close). In the 1890s Church was responsible for the rebuilding of most of the commercial buildings in Powis Street. His style has been characterized as \\"conservative but eclectic, clumsy but lively\\". The redevelopment of Powis street was stimulated, strangely enough, by the impending end of the Powis lease in 1898. The owner of the freehold, Maj. Robert Alexander Ogilby, encouraged rebuilding by granting favourable new leases to those who did. Around 1890, 75% of the buildings in Powis Street were commercial, although rarely exclusively so. There were 39 drapers' and milliners' shops in central Woolwich, most of them in Powis Street. The west end of the street had remained largely residential but that changed when the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS, established in 1868) started its formidable expansion here at the beginning of the new century. From the early 1880s until 1908 trams ran along Powis Street.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 195-198.

Church. Most buildings were now three or more storeys high with shops on the ground floor and tenants living above. There were still 830 people living in the street in 1901. Some new buildings had offices over the shops. The Woolwich Equitable Building Society had built itself a grand new head office on the corner of Eleanor Road. Further west, the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society moved into an imposing new building with shops and offices in 1902. Marks & Spencer arrived around 1912 but was relatively small until they rebuilt in the early 1930s and late 1950s. Burton opened its first shop in Powis Street in 1922, followed by two more. Together with Cuffs and Garretts,Garretts was based in Kent House, on the northeast corner with Macbean Street. The sales rooms occupied three floors with workrooms above for hat and dress makers, and a large dining room and dormitories for employees. It gradually evolved from a draper's to a department store in the 1920s and was promoted as \\"south east London's quality store\\" in the 1960s until it closed in 1972. Cuffs, on the other corner of Macbean Street, was its big rival. After modernising in the mid-1950s, it briefly overtook Garrets. It survived a decade longer, until 1983. Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 211-212. RACS was the biggest retailer throughout the first half of the century. It became even bigger in 1940, when it opened an ultra modern department store across the road from its existing Central Stores. This part of the street had always lagged behind a bit, but became a lot busier after two huge cinemas were built at its western extremity, but not before the road had been widened (1933‚Äì34).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 196, 198-199. The freehold of the Powis estate, since 1812 in the hands of the Ogilby family, passed on to Chesterfield Properties Ltd. in 1964. Many of the leases given out in 1898 had been for sixty years and so another round of redevelopment took place in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Cuffs was in 1956 the first to rebuild in a modernist style. Others followed and more and more ornate Victorian shops were replaced by unadorned modern blocks with cantilevered canopies and glass curtain walls. Some smaller shops were not able to pay the higher rents and were replaced by chain stores. In 1957, Christmas lights were introduced, just three years after Regent Street, two years before Oxford Street. The introduction of parking meters on 11 May 1961 (also the opening day of the notorious Auto Stacker) was among the first in London. Various plans for pedestrianisation and covered walkways from the 1960s never materialised.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 196, 198-200. The closure of the Royal Ordnance Factory in 1967 and the Siemens factory in 1968 proved to be a turning-point for Woolwich and decline set in. In Powis Street the effects became notable in the 1970s and 80s. Garrets closed in 1972; Cuffs in 1983; the RACS stores in 1985. Their buildings remained empty or were occupied by discount retailers and charity shops. Amidst the decline, the United Kingdom's first branch of McDonald's opened in Powis Street in 1974. Partial pedestrianisation came in the early 1980s, but by then the street had lost its appeal to shoppers who preferred modern shopping malls in Lewisham, Bexleyheath and Bromley. During the 2011 riots, several shops were looted and one was destroyed by arson. With the regeneration of the Royal Arsenal and other parts of the town, the street has seen some improvement in the new millennium, with the arrival of multiples like Starbucks (2008), Nando's (2010), Travelodge (2012), T.K. Maxx (2013), Dunkin' Donuts (2014), Granier (2015), Clockjack (2016) and Antic (exptected to open in 2017).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 17-18, 199-200. Marks & Spencer however, left Powis Street in 2014 (after more than a century) in order to open an M&S; food hall at the Royal Arsenal two years later. The west end of the street is still struggling, although both co-op buildings have successfully been restored and been given a new purpose. The longest established retailer is H. Samuel, jewellers since 1904 at 40 Powis Street. The freehold of most of the shops and apartments was held by Powis Street Estates Ltd. until 2014, then part of the portfolio was sold to Mansford LLP, and sold again to British Land in 2018.

It went through various rebuilding campaigns. About half of the shops here have Victorian or Edwardian fa√ßades, although storefronts are almost exclusively modern. The corner of Green's End with the south side of Powis Street (nrs 1-7) was redeveloped in 1958-60, after a design by British-American architect Hector Hamilton. It features glass curtain walls with artificial-stone mullions, a pavement canopy and a set-back corner with diamond-patterned ornament. The next two buildings on the south side (nrs 9-21) are of the same proportions and from the same period but were both refronted in the first decade of the 21st century. This is followed by what was originally a uniform row of seven shops by H.H. Church, built in 1899-1900, of which three have survived (nrs 23-27). Further west are a three- bay shop from 1925 (nrs 33-35), some unassuming brick buildings of 1956-58 (nrs 37-45), another brick building of 2013-14 that replaced a shop by H.H. Church destroyed in the 2011 London riots (nrs 47-49), and two shops by local builder W. Harris of 1866-68 (nrs 51-53). The Marks & Spencer building on the corner of Calderwood Street (nrs 55-69) was started in the 1930s and extended in a similar style in the 1960s. Its fa√ßade is clad with artificial-stone tiles, which was the company's uniform style at the time.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 200-202. The building on the opposite corner of Calderwood Street (nrs 71-77) was part of an ambitious plan of 1958 for a shopping mall and an office tower block on the south side of Powis Street, extending over the railway. The original plan was redesigned in 1966, but only partly realised in the early 1970s. To the west of this development are pairs of shops of 1867 (nrs 79-81) and the late 1890s (nrs 83-95). The last pair is the sole survivor of a larger block that was demolished to create the entrance for the intended shopping mall. In 2016 plans were submitted to build apartments above the one- storey shop units on this site (nrs 97-101). Further west are two more pairs of shops from the 1890s (nrs 103-109). The last block (nrs 111-113, on the corner of Barnard Close) was the head office of the Woolwich Equitable Building Society from 1896 until 1935, when they moved to Equitable House in General Gordon Square.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 203-205.

On the corner with Beresford Square (nrs 2-10) is a modern development of 1959-60, featuring stone-clad concrete frames and a pavement canopy, similar to the one on the opposite corner. The former Shakespeare public house (nr 12) was established in 1807 and probably took its name from the adjacent theatre. It was rebuilt by H.H. Church in 1890-91 and survived little altered. It is topped by a pediment with a bust of Shakespeare and an imp atop. The site of the former theatre (nrs 14-16) is now occupied by a building from 1958-60. Next door are twin shops (nrs 18-20) built in a revivalist style reminiscent of Church in 1923. The two rows of red-brick shops that follow (nrs 22-28 and 32-42) were built by Church in 1894-99. They are separated by a narrow street, Murray's Yard. The corners feature pointed and stepped Flemish gables (the stepped gable is repeated on the Murray Yard side). The row originally continued further west, but some of it (nrs 44-48) was replaced by Woolwich Borough Council's Electric House in 1935-36. This is a classically proportioned building which has kept its cream- coloured faience fa√ßade and bronze window frames on the upper storeys, as well as some of the interior decorations. Adjacent are two almost identical modernist buildings of 1959-60 (nrs 50-60) and three smaller shops (nrs 62-66).Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 205-211. More or less half-way in Powis Street, the two great rivals Garretts and Cuffs occupied imposing buildings on either side of Macbean Street. On the north east corner is Kent House (nrs 68-86), named after an earlier development on this site. It was rebuilt by Garretts in the 1890s. The architect was, again, H.H. Church, who this time used yellow brick and a more classical style. Although nowadays divided into smaller shop units, with unharmonious storefronts, Kent House is still considered Church's best surviving work in Powis Street. On the other corner of Macbean Street stood Cuffs (nrs 88-104), moderner but equally grand. After its closure in 1983, it was demolished and replaced by a fortress-like block occupied by a supermarket and some smaller shops. Its neighbour further west (nrs 106-112), built in 1959-61, has the same proportions but has a more lively fa√ßade through the use of Ancaster stone panels set against a Portland stone background, as well as having apartments above the shops.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 211-212.

Big buildings dominate this part of the street. On the south west corner with Barnard Close (nrs 115-123, opposite Hare Street) five late-Victorian shops were replaced by a building designed by Rodney Gordon (of Owen Luder Partnership) in 1964-65. Its style has been characterized as \\"blowsy forcefulness\\".Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 205. Clock tower RACS buildings Its neighbour is the late- or rather Neo-Victorian Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society Central Stores (nrs 125-153). With its 82 m long fa√ßade it is the largest building in the street. It was designed by the Society's architect, Frank Bethell, and built in three phases, replacing a number of existing RACS shops and adjacent buildings. The easternmost part, including the central tower, was built in 1902-03. The second range was finished in 1912 and the last section in 1926. Above its main entrance is a large statue by Alfred Drury of the RACS' founder, Alexander McLeod (1832‚Äì1902). Its 32 m high copper-domed clock tower made it look grander than any other shop in Woolwich. With its red brick and moulded terracotta fa√ßade, the architectural critic Ian Nairn thought it would look more at home in the Midlands. After RACS lost its independence in 1985, the Central Stores closed and were used by Greenwich Council. In 1989 the building was listed. In 2011-13 it was converted into a hotel with 120 rooms and shop units.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 214-217. A vacant lot with a large car park separates the hotel from Woolwich County Court, built by the Office of Works in 1935-36, shortly after the road was widened here. It is a simple red brick building with a Portland stone entrance and the royal arms above. Further west is a short row of Neo-Georgian shops built in 1937-38 after the road-widening. The corner of Parson's Hill, originally the name of this whole area, is occupied by the Castle Tavern (nrs 179), a famous Woolwich hostelry in the 19th century, rebuilt in 1937.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 78-79.

This development on the corner of Hare Street was a spear point in the 2012 Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan.Woolwich Town Centre Masterplan SPD (2012), p. 36. The two smaller buildings further west (nrs 132-136) were once part of the RACS emporium. One was built in red brick by H.H. Church in 1901 and was used as a chemist's and optician's. The other one, a slender four-storey structure with bay windows, was built in 1930-31 as the Society's funeral furnishers.Saint & Guillery (2012), p. 212. Planning permission was granted in 2016 to convert both buildings into a pub.'Woolwich round-up: Antic's plan for second Woolwich pub proceeding & Barracks to close' on fromthemurkydepths.co.uk, 8 November 2016. The RACS department store (nrs 138-152) was built in 1938-40 in a streamlined Art Deco style. The store had an open arcade with glass display islands at ground floor and a stylish restaurant on the third floor. The large, metal-framed windows emphasise the horizontal lines in the faience-tiled gable, set between two end towers. The elegant east tower contains an open stairwell with wrought-iron railings with the letters 'co op' integrated in the design. The west tower is less pronounced and stands over an access road to Mortgramit Square. Early plans for the so-called Triangle between Powis Street and Hare Street comprised demolition of the locally listed building. In 2013-16 it was converted into apartments (\\"The Emporium\\"), adding three recessed storeys on top of the restored building.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 217-220. Next to the Mortgramit Square entrance is a row of eight two-storey shops, partly in a dilapidated state. Halfway is a tiled building that used to be the showroom of Furlongs Garage. The gate still provides access to the garage and petrol station on Woolwich High Street. The row ends with a former doctor's house and surgery (nrs 170-172; originally nr 1). This house of 1898-99 has a double datestone, one from 1798, a relic from the early beginnings of the street.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 71-73, 78-79. The last building on this side of Powis Street is the former Granada Cinema, Woolwich, now a church of Pentecostalism. The imposing brown-brick building has a curved fa√ßade and a slender advertising tower (Cecil Massey & Reginald Uren, 1936‚Äì37). It was built in a modified modern architecture style, mindful of the Dutch architect Willem Marinus Dudok. Its magnificent Gothic and eclectic interior, originally seating 3,000, was designed by Theodore Komisarjevsky.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 74-76.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three small, pale creamy-white flowers. It has a relatively late flowering period compared to similar spider orchids. Description Caladenia postea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, long and wide. Up to three pale creamy white flowers with red markings and long, wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have long, thin, brown, thread-like ends. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are about the same size as the dorsal sepal, held horizontally near their bases then turn downwards and droop. The petals are long, wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is long, wide and creamy-white with pale red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have short, blunt teeth and the tip is curled under. There are two rows of anvil-shaped, cream-coloured calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia postea was first described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected in the Mundaring State Forest and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (postea) is a Latin word meaning \\"after\\", \\"behind\\" or \\"following\\" referring to the late flowering period of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The dark-tipped spider orchid is found in a few locations between York and the Brookton Highway in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in damp places. Conservation Caladenia postea is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

Also known as Interurban Train Mexico City-Toluca, the passenger railway line will connect the cities of Toluca and Mexico City. The project was announced by President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto on 1 December 2012. Construction began in July 2014. By December 2018, it was estimated to open around 2022. Map of the commuter rail line under construction Background As a part of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto's Presidency to offer public transport from Toluca to Mexico City, a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis report was drafted and published in November 2013. The report proposed several routes. The three routes were concentrated to the metro terminals of Cuatro Caminos, Tacubaya, and Observatorio. Ultimately, the third route along Avenida Las Torres to Observatorio was chosen in order to avert future sprawl, avoid deforestation in the Sierra de las Cruces, and prevent pollution of aquifers that supply water to residents. A section of the chosen route was altered by in October 2015 to no longer run above Avenida Vasco de Quiroga in Cuajimalpa. The railway line will be electrified and elevated with a tunnel portion between the State of Mexico and Mexico City. There are six stations planned. Four stations will be located in the State of Mexico and the remaining two will be located in Mexico City. The line is designed to complement the Mexico City Metro by terminating at Observatorio station of Line 1 and provide heavy railway service to the Santa Fe business district. A shuttle will provide connection to Toluca International Airport at the Tecnol√≥gico station. The commuter line will run parallel to Avenida Las Torres and Mexican Federal Highway 15/Mexican Federal Highway 15D. The total cost of the project was estimated at $38.6 billion MXN in 2014. Construction The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) divided the project into three sections for contractors to bid on: :Section 1 covers the western terminal in Zinacantepec to the eastern tunnel entrance at Sierra de las Cruces. This encompasses of the project. The contracts were awarded to La Peninsular Compa√±√≠a Constructora and Constructora de Proyectos Viales de M√©xico. :Section 2 is the tunnel portion underneath Sierra de las Cruces. was awarded the contract. :Section 3 involves the Mexico City portion from the western tunnel entrance at Sierra de las Cruces to the Metro Observatorio Station. The contract was awarded to a consortium. For its rolling stock, Spanish manufacturing company CAF was awarded a contract in 2014 to construct 30 EMUs for $11.6 billion MXN (‚Ç¨690 million). Each EMU will have five cars, have a capacity of 700 passengers, and operate at a maximum speed of . Deliveries for the trainsets began in January 2017. The train depot will be located west of Zinacantepec station at a cost of MXN942 million. The contract was awarded to a consortium in March 2016. In July 2014, a formal ceremony was carried out by the head of SCT, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, to mark the start of construction. There have been several construction accidents during the project. On 4 May 2016, the temporary support structures gave way, causing the concrete decking to collapse near the intersection of Avenida Las Torres and Avenida Col√≥n in Toluca. On 2 June 2016, bad weather caused concrete-reinforced rebar to fold onto traffic near the intersection of Avenida Las Torres and Avenida D√≠az Mir√≥n in Toluca. On 7 July 2016, a work site caved in killing one worker and injuring two. On 16 July 2016, a construction worker was killed when a truck lost control and struck the worker on a construction site in Metepec. In July 2019, the SCT determined the project's completion would be delayed to the end of 2022. Javier Jim√©nez Espri√∫, head of the SCT, announced the project was 87% complete, however, there have been cost overruns from $42.72 billion MXN in 2015 to $73.72 billion MXN in 2019.

Edwin Fuller was a fast bowler. On his first-class debut, in the annual match between Canterbury and Otago in 1872‚Äì73, he opened the attack and, bowling unchanged, took 5 for 20 and 6 for 23 in an innings victory for Canterbury. Ten of his 11 victims were bowled. In his next match, in 1873‚Äì74, he took 5 for 38 and 7 for 47 when Canterbury lost by 7 runs to Auckland. Later that season Otago beat Canterbury by an innings, but Fuller still took 6 for 44. In 1881‚Äì82 he took 6 for 62 and 5 for 29 against Otago, but Otago won by 77 runs. His most notable feat occurred not in a first-class match but when a Canterbury XV played the touring Australians in January 1878. He did not bowl in the first innings when Canterbury dismissed the Australians for 46. In the second innings, after Canterbury had taken a first-innings lead of 89, he took advantage of a pitch that \\"played rather bumpily\\", taking 8 for 35 to restrict the Australians' second innings to 143. Canterbury had only 55 to chase, which they reached with eight wickets down and six to spare. It was the only defeat the Australians suffered on their tour of New Zealand. Fuller was also Canterbury's most successful bowler when the English team visited in 1881-82, taking 4 for 49 off 54 four-ball overs. Bowling for the Midland club in senior club cricket in Christchurch in 1880-81 he took 83 wickets at an average of 9.7. He ran a sporting goods shop in central Christchurch.

Attack at the 31 Connollystra√üe In the early morning of 5 September 1972, Safady and seven of his fellow fedayeen broke into the Israeli delegations headquarters at 31 Connollystra√üe. After the fedayeen had captured the Israel's in apartment number one and three, they led the Israeli's under guard down the stairs to the ground floor of the building. As Israeli wrestler Gad Tsobari reached the bottom of the stairs, he pushed a hooded terrorist aside and made a dash towards the entrance to the underground car park. As Tsobari made his escape, the wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg tackled Safady, landing a devastating punch on the young fedayeen's jaw, fracturing it and knocking out several of his teeth. As Moshe Weinberg attempted to seize Safady's gun, which now lay on the floor, another fedayeen shot Weinberg through the chest with a burst from his Kalashnikov rifle. F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base Safady, along with Jamal and Adnan Al-Gashey were the only three of the eight terrorists to survive the firefight between German police and the Palestinian terrorists at F√ºrstenfeldbruck. Aftermath After their release by the German government on 29 October 1972, seven and a half weeks after they were captured, Safady along with Jamal and Adnan Al-Gashey were flown to Tripoli where they gave a press conference to the world's media. Safady can be seen seated to the right of Jamal Al-Gashey in the centre. Both Safady's and Adnan Al-Gashey's fate after the Munich attack has caused much speculation. The documentary One Day In September (2000) states that he was killed by Israeli assassination squads in the aftermath of the Munich operation. However, in his book Striking back : the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre and Israel's deadly response, author Aaron J Klein claims that during a conversation with Tawfiq Tirawi in Ramallah in 2005 he was told that Safady was \\"alive as you are\\". Tirawi did not divulge any further information, only adding that \\"the Israelis could still harm him.\\" Klein also claims that members of the intelligence community speculated that Safady could have been killed by Lebanese Christian Phalangists as a 'gesture' to the Israeli Mossad.

They are an example of an engineering control within the hierarchy of hazard controls. Sticky mats are typically used in cleanrooms and construction sites. Their purpose is to prevent contaminants from entering the site with personnel, and hazardous materials from exiting. In a cleanroom setting, airborne particles that are not removed by the ventilation system deposit themselves onto a surface, where they can be transported by personnel walking on or past them. Sticky mats can be temporary or permanent. Temporary sticky mats are made of a stack of adhesive plastic film layers that are periodically peeled off and discarded. Permanent mats are made of a polymer, usually polyester- or polyvinyl chloride-based, that binds particles through electrostatic forces. The peeling process for temporary mats may dislodge particles from the mat, causing inhalation risk. However, permanent mats must be washed with a mop and detergent, which is more time- consuming and may be done less often. A 2012 study found that temporary adhesive mats reduced the particle level on shoes and overshoes by 20‚Äì50% while permanent polymeric flooring reduced it by approximately 80%, and that adhesive mats released more particles when they were dirtier and when they were peeled quickly. However, sticky mats placed outside the entrance to an operating room or suite have not been shown to reduce the number of organisms on shoes or stretcher wheels, nor do they reduce the risk of surgical site infections.

It came from a very old war dance called Atrikpui and usually performed by the Ewe people of the Volta Region of Ghana, particularly during the Hogbetsotso Festival, a celebration by the Anlo Ewe people. In addition, it is also performed by Togolese and Beninese of Ewe descent. The dance has five movements in performing it, 1. Banyinyi which is a short introductory in prayer to the gods and ancestors, 2. Vutsortsor which is the main dance, 3. Adzo- which is less energetic and only the master is made to drum along with Gankogui and Axatse, 4. Hatsatsa- historical songs are performed along with Gankogui and Atoke, 5. Vutsortsor- finally, another round of the main dance which usually last for a number of hours. Gankogui is an instrument in a form of a bell where a stick is used to play. Atoke is also an iron banana shaped bell and played with a small forged iron rod. The Atoke can be used in place of the Gankogui they are both used for the same purpose. The dance is usually played at funerals, weddings, and parties. Essentially, it is played at any occasion that called for an Ewe identity emblem, since this music is known by other ethnic groups to be uniquely Ewe. Everyone is welcome to join in the dance, unlike other Ewe dances, which sometimes are reserved for people of a certain age, religion, or gender. The dance is sometimes known as the ‚Äúchicken dance‚Äù due to the bird-like motions required for the dance.  Origin  Agbadza finds its origin in the times of war. The Ewe people went through various times of war and oppression before settling down in the Volta Region of Ghana and in Southern Togo. In order to train their warriors to be ready for battle, the Ewes used various songs and dances to encourage the warriors. Through this a dance called Atrikpui was born. This dance later evolved to Agbadza, which is no longer used for war but rather in events that are more joyful. Through Agbadza, at the time known as Atrikpui, Ewe singers and poets sang about battles, life and death, heroism, cowardice, migration, conquest, imperialism, and a warrior ethos. The move towards Agbadza was done due to a period of peace that was enjoyed by the Ewes around the 1920s, and so instead they decided to use some of their old songs as entertainment. Today, Agbadza is the most famous and widely played Ewe dance. Drummers playing the Agbadza drum  Instruments  Bell: It has a recurring phrase that establishes the tempo of the song and serves as a timeline for the rest of the ensemble. Sogo: This is the ensemble leader drum. It indicates to the other drums what they are supposed to be playing. This drum also signals the dancers when they are supposed to be starting to dance, through the use of drumming language. Kidi: This is the second drum in the ensemble. It communicates with the Sogo to create a conversation using drumming language. Kagan: This is a support drum, which has a recurring rhythm throughout the performance that interacts with the bell to create a specific melody. Rattle/ Axatse: This is a beaded-rattle that follows the rhythm of the timeline closely to complement the Agbadza song. Handclaps: The handclaps in Agbadza are used to add human interaction to the song and create a dense musical texture of high energy.  Song  The song is based on a call and responses system, which is widely present in the music of West Africa. Call: Se Se Se Ioooo Response: Aho Aho Ahoooo Call: Se Se Se Iooo Response: Aho Aho Ahoooo ALL: Enyo o Egble o ahooo :Ne meku Agbadzawua nadim hee :Ne meku Agbadzawua nadim hee :Ne mekua Kiniwua nadi hee :Ne makua Kiniwua nadi hee  References  FORCETOC Ewe people African dances Ghanaian music Togolese music ","title":"Agbadza"},{"id":"53405939","text":"Tony Aimo (born 24 August 1960) is a Papua New Guinean politician. He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2002 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2013, representing the electorate of Ambunti-Drekikir Open. He was Minister for orrectional Services under Michael Somare from 2007 until 2011, although he was stood aside for three months in 2010. A long-time People's Action Party member, he was briefly reported to have joined the Papua New Guinea Party following the fall of the Somare government, only to emerge as a member of Somare's National Alliance Party. First term He was first elected to parliament at the 2002 election, representing the People's Action Party. In August 2004, he moved a leadership challenge that replaced Moses Maladina with Brian Pulayasi as PAP leader, resolving to keep the party in government after Maladina's sacking as deputy prime minister. He was a candidate in a long-running battle over a mid-term vacancy for Governor of West Sepik Province, eventually dropping his candidacy in favour of Peter Wararu Waranaka after a series of court battles. He was re-elected for PAP at the 2007 election. Minister for Correctional Services In September 2007, Aimo was appointed Minister for Correctional Services as part of Michael Somare's post-election reshuffle. His first year in the role saw refurbishment work on five prisons, reviving of promotion within the correctional services department, the implementation of an equal opportunity policy, and recruiting more than 200 warders. He was the cause of some controversy when, on a trip to open a refurbished jail in Madang, he refused to pay a hotel minibar bill and swore at hotel and airport staff in a drunken outburst. He was temporarily stripped of his portfolio in January 2010 after a major prison escape at the maximum-security Bomana prison in Port Moresby, while remaining in Cabinet as minister without portfolio. Aimo publicly blamed the broader government for the breakout, claiming that security had been compromised due to \\"insufficient funding for manpower and upgrades\\", and suggested that Papua New Guinea's prisons were outdated and needed to be replaced to meet modern requirements. However, he was reinstated to his portfolio by April. In June 2010, Aimo was one of three politicians accused in court by an alleged bank robber as having benefited from the refinery of a gold robbery, in claims which he slammed as \\"malicious and unfounded\\"; the allegations were again repeated in court the next year. In August 2010, he publicly floated the notion of recruiting an expatriate to head the country's prison system, which received cautious praise from the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce; however, after heavy criticism from the Public Employees Association, he declared it was \\"just an idea\\". Defeat, reinstatement, unseating and second defeat Aimo was reported to have been one of 48 MPs to defect from the government and elect Opposition Leader Peter O'Neill as Prime Minister in August 2011. In October, he and three other PAP MPs defected to the Papua New Guinea Party, a member of the new governing coalition. However, after ousted Prime Minister Somare, who was contesting his removal in court, appointed Aimo to his alternative ministry, he publicly called on the Australian government not to recognise O'Neill, declaring him an \\"illegal Prime Minister\\" who \\"repeatedly thumbs his nose at the highest court\\". He contested the 2012 election for Somare's National Alliance Party, but was defeated by newcomer Ezekiel Anisi. He filed an election petition challenging the result two weeks later, alleging that Anisi was under the constitutional minimum age of 25 and that his name was not on the Common Roll. In October, the National Court upheld Aimo's petition, declared Anisi's election null and void, and declared Aimo duly elected. He took his seat in late October, sitting as a National Alliance MP. However, Anisi appealed to the Supreme Court, which in July 2013 ruled in Anisi's favour, finding Aimo not duly elected, and declaring a by-election in the seat. Anisi won the by- election in December 2013, with Aimo also beaten for second place. He is contesting the 2017 general election for the National Party.

The partnership of the Tarletons and Backhouse purchased her in 1779. She first traded between Liverpool and Jamaica, and then became a slaver. She was lost in November 1788. Merchantman The High Court of Admiralty condemned her on 4 November 1778 and she was made free on 5 February 1779 at Liverpool. She underwent a good repair in 1780. She then sailed and between Liverpool and Jamaica.Lloyd's Register (1781), Seq. ‚ÑñT6. She underwent a good repair again in 1782. After Parliament passed the Registry Act (1786), the Tarletons and Backhouse twice registered her at Liverpool: on 13 November 1786 (Liverpool; ‚Ññ154/86), and then on 16 October 1788 (Liverpool; ‚Ññ79/88). Slave trading voyages Between 1785 and 1788 Tarleton made three voyages as a slaver, foundering at the outset of the fourth.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Voyages: Tarleton (1785-88). Captain Patrick Fairweather was an experienced captain of slave ships. He had made his first voyage to Calabar in 1755, probably as an apprentice on Dalrymple while still a teenager. His first command had been in 1768. First slaving voyage: Fairweather left Liverpool on 24 March 1784, bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands to gather his slaves. He gathered the slaves at Calabar and then delivered them to Grenada, arriving on 3 February 1785. Fairweather had embarked 557 slaves and disembarked 510, for a loss rate of 8.4%. Her crew of 38 suffered three deaths. Tarleton left Grenada 7 March and arrived at Liverpool 21 April 1785. Second slaving voyage: Fairweather sailed from Liverpool on 23 June 1785 bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands to gather his slaves. She arrived at Calabar on 14 August. She stayed there 180 days. Tarleton left on 20 March 1786. Tarleton delivered the slaves to Dominica, where she arrived on 9 May. She had embarked 440 slaves and disembarked 360, for a loss rate of 18.2%. She also had 46 crew men, five of whom died on the voyage. At some point in the voyage Captain Thomas Smith replaced Fairweather. Tarleton left Dominica on 4 July, and arrived at Liverpool on 5 September. When she arrived at Liverpool she brought with her 57 puncheons and one butt of palm oil, 50 barrels of pepper, 105 ivory tusks, eight tons of redwood, and cargo from the West Indies. A listing of cargoes taken up at Old Calabar between 1785 and 1788 states records that on one voyage Tarleton loaded 440 slaves, an estimated 1,512 lbs of ivory, 4,915 gals of palm oil, 9,800 lbs of pepper, and 17,920 lbs of redwood. While Fairweather and Tarleton were at Calabar, , another vessel under the ownership of the Tarleton-Backhouse partnership, arrived there. Fairweather sent Banastre, Thomas Smith, master, to the coast of Cameroon. When she arrived there some natives in a canoe approached to trade with her, but were warned off by a shot from another slave vessel, , that killed one of the natives. Captain James McGauley, of Othello, had ordered the shot fired because the natives on that coast owed him a debt and he had declared that he would permit no trade until they had paid him. In 1793 the case of Tarleton and others vs. McGauley came to trial with the plaintiffs suing McGauley for loss of trade. The court found for the plaintiffs, establishing that it is a tort \\"to cause damage to a person by maliciously using any unlawful means, (e.g. fraud, or threats of assault), to induce anyone to abstain from entering into a contract with him.\\" Third slaving voyage: Tarletons master was J. Smith, and her trade was Liverpool- Africa.Lloyd's Register (1787), Seq. ‚Ññ7. Alternatively, her master may have been Thomas Smith, replaced by Patrick Fairweather. She left Liverpool on 26 August 1786 and left Calabar after 281 days. (However, the same source states that Tarleton and Fairweather left Liverpool on 25 December 1786, which is more consistent with having arrived in Liverpool in September, and is also consistent with the data in the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade Database.) Tarleton left Africa on 19 February 1788 and arrived at Dominica on 11 May. When she arrived she was carrying 308 slaves, 45 ivory tusks, 94 puncheons, 8 butts, and 15 tierces of palm oil, 50 tons of redwood, and 60 barrels of Guinea pepper. She had started with 371 slaves, and another three to five slaves died after arrival, for a loss rate o f18.6%. She left Dominica on 24 June and arrived at Liverpool on 24 June with 80 tons of redwood and cargo from the West Indies. Another account describes her cargo from Africa as 377 slaves, an estimated 648 lbs. of ivory, 9,600 gallons of palm oil, 11,760 lbs. of pepper, and 112,000 lbs of redwood. Loss Tarleton, Christian, master, was on her way to Africa on her fourth slaving voyage when she foundered on 28 November 1788 off St David's Head. Her crew was saved.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ1788. She had left Liverpool 10 November 1788. The Liverpool Registry records her as having been lost off the coast of Wales, and gives a date of 26 May 1789, but this date may represent a declaration rather than the date of the actual loss.

Davis (July 8, 1916 ‚Äì November 30, 1997) was an American artist, graphic designer and muralist who created three post office murals as part of the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Early life Fay Elizabeth Davis was born on July 8, 1916, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Georgia (n√©e Amick) and Julian Davis. She attended the John Herron Art Institute, graduating in 1938. That same year, she won the prize for the best entry in the Indiana Art Exhibit. Career The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock, mural study, for the U.S. Post Office at Oglesby, Illinois, by Fay E. Davis, ca. 1941 Davis was one of the artists working for the Works Project Administration (WPA) to complete murals depicting regional scenes. The artists were encouraged to visit the towns where they were to work to incorporate themes important to the local area. Paintings typically were completed off-site and then sent to the building in which they were to be installed. She won a commission to complete the post office mural for Ligonier, Indiana, which was installed in 1940. The painting, Cutting Timber depicted lumberjacks felling trees and removing them by oxcart. Davis won two commissions in Illinois, Loading the Packet for the Chester post office and The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock at Oglesby. Loading the Packet was completed in 1940 and portrays the daily lives of citizens during the peak of riverboat travel‚Äîchildren playing, families talking and dockworkers loading boats. It was cherished by the community as reflective of their heritage, with the postmaster once saying if the building caught fire, the mural rather than the mail should be saved. In 1942, Davis's second Illinois mural, The Illini and Potawatomies Struggle at Starved Rock, was installed in the post office at Oglesby. She had won the commission to paint the mural the previous year and made several trips to Starved Rock State Park to prepare the painting, which features 14 Native Americans in battle. Some of the fighters are on horseback and others are on foot. Painted in muted earth tones, the painting faded badly and was restored in 1988. In 1993, the mural came back into the news when a janitor at the post office claimed the nudity of the figures rendered the scene pornographic and filed a union grievance; while his complaint was being reviewed, the painting was shielded from the public by blinds. After a petition drive by local citizens to remove the blinds, the mural was uncovered and back on public display. Post office employees reported that the controversy had elevated the number of people who came to see the painting. On December 18, 1943, Davis married fellow artist and Herron alumnus, George M. Prout in Columbus, Indiana. She worked at Staley Manufacturing Company as a drafter, while continuing to work in a studio she and her husband shared in Columbus. The year following her marriage, Davis- Prout won first prize in the 37th Annual Indiana Artists Exhibition, the oldest art competition in the state, with her entry Coal for Chicago. In 1947, she went to work at Arvin Industries in the Columbus plant, remaining there for at least five years. In 1959, the couple relocated to Sarasota, Florida, and then moved to Bradenton in 1972. Death and legacy Davis-Prout died on November 30, 1997, in Bradenton, Manatee County, Florida.

More specifically, it was found to be from the Cenomanian Age about 93.9-100.5 million years ago in the suburb area of Bileca, Herzegovina. Pachyophis belongs to the family Simoliophiidae (hind- limbed snakes) in the clade Ophidia. The family is characterized by the presence of hindlimbs and pelvic girdles, as seen in Pachyrhachis (one of the first discovered hind-limbed snakes). Included in the most basal of snake relatives, Pachyophis in contrast does not have evidence of any form of limb preservation. Despite this, they are considered under Pachyophiidae due to their other morphological similarities along with the generas Mesophis and Simoliophis. Only one species has been discovered for the genus Pachyophis. This holotype is known as Pachyophis woodwardi. Description Pachyophis Cladogram Pachyophis is considered a hind-limbed snake despite presence of any indication of forelimbs or shoulder girdle due to its other shared general morphology. All Simoliophiidae display evident pachyostosis (increase in bone massiveness) and osteosclerosis (increase in inner bone compactness). Pachyophis evidently displays such in their vertebrae specifically. Other shared characteristics include a smaller head and distally straight ribs for a lateral compression of the trunk. The holotype Pachyophis woodwardi exhibits a body extension of a total of 60 cm. The body structure of such has an overall flattened morphology and distinctively severe pachyostosis. This is especially in comparison to other related taxa like Pachyrhacis. The differences are likely attributed to adaptations to its aquatic dwelling habitat. All physical characteristic known are based solely specific on the three specimens discovered under this holotype. =Skull= The skull itself is slender and pointed in nature. Relation wise, the skull is about an eighteenth of the trunk length. The jaw bones are more reminiscent of lizards than snakes. The upper jaw closely relates to that of varanids, scincoids, and dolichosaurids. The maxilla specifically resembles that of lepidosaurs more so than that of snakes. The lower jaw is more resembles that of dolichosaurids. The upper jaw measures 17 mm in length. Its shaped into a long triangular surface which is longitudinally concave and narrow in structure. Its highest point reaches 2.1mm forming a blunt tip and concave posterior outline on the shorter edge. The jawbone is approximately 1m thick. The anterior end represents the antorbital part of the jaw. A notable posterior concave outline represents the orbital opening as well as the beginning of the lacrimal. This projection then forms the connection of the jawbone with the palatine. At the anterior tip a small grove at the lower edge shows swollen character. Directly above it are two small groves with blunt lumps dividing them. This is representative of a suture and likely the location where the upper jawbone joins the premaxilla in the nasal opening region. The lower jaw measures 15.5mm in length and 1.9mm in width. The edges are elevated to produce a concavity that extends 3.5mm to a point posteriorly. The angular is the largest bone being widest anteriorly. It meets the splenial anteroventrally in a vertical joint. The splenial is preserved only at the joint, forming a bulge on the ventral margin. It is inferred then that the intramandibular joint is situated far anteriorly. This resembles that of Pachyrhachis. The tooth row extends the same length as exhibited in the upper jaw for equal alignment. =Dentition= In contrast to the jaw, Pachyophis teeth clearly resemble that of snakes. Their dentition show thecodont nature, their teeth fitted into bowl like alveoli lined on the jaw bones. The enamel layer of the teeth is well developed with large, hollow pulp cavities possessing small openings leading into them. The tooth row extends the entirety of the jaw with the teeth curving backwards anteriorly. The first three teeth stand 2.8mm apart, with the following becoming more crowded so the last six teeth stand only 2.4mm apart. The more spaced teeth are longer and stronger in form, with lengths up to 1.6mm and 0.5mm thickness. The closer proximal teeth in contrast are shorter with lengths of 0.8mm and widths of 0.3mm. =Vertebrae= The articulation of all the vertebrae together is very snakelike. Yet the construction of the vertebrae themselves are very unlike such. The anterior vertebrae are smaller than the more posterior. The neural arches grow to be more swollen moving anterior to posterior, indicative of pachystotic nature. Zygosphenes presence are notable in some vertebrae. They project anteriorly from the neural arch and reach more dorsally than that of the zygapophyses located above the centrum. Neural spines rise from the zygosphene horizontally for a reach midlength of the vertebrae. This length increases to peak at the posterior end. At the anterior end, the neural arches are characteristically thin and shorter rising at an angle of 45o post dorsally. Prezygapophyses are inclined at 40 degree angle anteriorly, becoming almost horizontal in the middle and then reobtaining their inclination anteriorly. Postzygapophyses width is slightly larger than that of the prezygapophyses. Both do not project very far laterally, with the anterior being more elongated that the posterior. =Ribs= The ribs are characterized by their needle like shape. Generally associated with the vertebrae, the ribs are technically not articulated to them. The upper third along the vertebral column are straight in shape, followed by a section of distinctive 120 degree bending, and then a return to the original straight form. The length of the ribs increases through the vertebral column. Pchyostosis also results in rib thickening, where the proximal section in each rib is around three times thicker in the posterior most than the anterior most. All exhibit a tapering to the distal tip for a consistent slender end. =Scales= Exact knowledge of scalation of Pachyophis is not definitive. Scale repetition is defined in transverse rows, running parallel to one at notable right angles to the cervical vertebral column. Each bulge believed to be a scale is approximately 2.2mm in length, with minimal thickness and spacing between neighbors of about 0.8mm. Paleobiology =Habitat= Pachyophis likely dwelled in shallow aquatic sea regions as evidenced by fossil location and morphology. Pre and post zygapophyses lend to undulating horizontal movement of the body. The neck in addition to this, had more flexibility and also indicates a range of vertical movement. This likely means that the Pachyophis' would hold its head above its flat bodied stature, indicative of shallow water dwelling character. Fossils were preserved specifically in calcareous mud, indicative of very little water movement in the environment. The rocks of Seli≈°ta were deposited in environments analogous to patch reef and inter reef basin systems. It is likely that Pachyophis coexisted along a diverse assemblage of marine squamates with a large diversity of fish fauna of a limited wave action lagoons. =Diet= Pachyophis' narrowly tapered mouth and sharp backward pointing teeth indicates its carnivorous diet by action of gripping versus biting methods. The jaw- teeth structure is designed for simultaneous grabbing and swallowing, fighting back against the forward pushing force of escaping prey. The jaw's posterior elongation was also notably blocked from opening very wide, another usual characteristic of snake feeding mechanisms. Thus soft, small and slippery animals were likely the main form of prey. Specifically, marine worms. Discovery Nopsca 1923 Skull and Skeleton Slab of Pachyophis woodwardi There is a single species discovered of Pachyophis, found in 1923 by F. Nopsca. The holotype Pachyophis woodwardi was discovered in a quarry in an eastern suburb of Bileca known as Seli≈°ta, located in East Herzegovina 40 km inland from Dubrovnik. Fossils of the area are generally from the Cenomanian- Turonian age, with Pachyophis being slightly younger found ranging in the mid to late Cenomanian layers. Three known preserved fossil specimens have been found. Specimens were preserved in bedded carbonate mudstone. One specimen was a postcranial skeleton and disarticulated skull preserved on a large slab of stone. Adjacently was another slab preserving three vertebral column segments in cross section. It is not known if these were all from the same individual organism. Yet the consistent ventral view, related bone size, and the overall skeletal arrangement does suggest such. *The only identifiable pieces of the skull in the larger slab was determined to be a well preserved maxilla and the posterior portion of the lower jaw. *The first of the vertebral segments consisted of thirty three articulated vertebrae with ribs. Following this was nine vertebrae shown in dorsal view, with the last few shown in right lateral face. Pelvic girdle and hindlimbs are absent. This segment is thought to represent the cervical vertebrae and few following dorsal. *The second segment is smaller and in ventral view consisting of sixteen articulated dorsal vertebrae with ribs. Less structural information is drawn from this segment, though all do display characteristic pachyostosis and osteosclerosis. Thickening proximal rib sections and notable emphasis anteriorly specifically. This segment is thought to represent the posterior dorsal section. *The third segment is most evident of pachyostotic ribs, which appear articulated with the vertebral column.

He also functioned as the commandant of the capital St. Petersburg for numerous years. After ending his active military service, he served in the Ministry of War. Military career Bashutsky was a member of the Polish Bashutsky family, whose members had moved to Russia in 1709. He entered military service on 24 June 1786, when he enlisted in the 3rd Marine Battalion. Two years later, he took part in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788‚Äì1790, and served at the battles of Seskar and Vyborg. In June 1796, Bashutsky moved to the Gatchina troops (as a lieutenant), while on 20 November of the same year he was transferred to the Life Guard Izmailovsk Regiment. In the ensuing years, Bashutsky would steadily rise through the ranks. On 9 September 1799, he became colonel (polkovnik), and four years later, on 8 September 1803, he was promoted to major general. Later that year, in December, he was appointed commander of St. Petersburg. In 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, Bashutsky led an army composed of the Life Guard Semyonovsk and Izmailovsk regiments at the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland. For his efforts in these battles, he earned the Order of St. George (3rd class) on 2 June 1808. Several months prior to receiving the award, in February 1808, he was appointed commander of the entire Life Guard Izmailovsk regiment. He remained its commander for about three years. On 10 November 1811, he was given command of the 25th division. Amidst Napoleon's invasion, Bashutsky oversaw the recruiting and training of the reserve battalions. In 1813, he was given command of the 1st Reserve Infantry Corps, and with it took part in the sieges of Modlin and Danzig. However, in March of the next year, in 1814, General replaced Bashutsky, and he therefore returned to his previous post as commander of the capital St. Petersburg. On 11 September 1816, Bashutsky was promoted to lieutenant general. About a decade later, in December 1825, he took part in the general suppression of the Decembrist revolt. On 7 July 1828, he was promoted to the rank of General of the Infantry. Bashutsky then served for a few more years, until 1832, after which he served in the Imperial Russian Ministry of War. He was dismissed from his post as commandant of St. Petersburg on 6 December 1833.

Dekle Beach is 21.8 miles south of the county seat of Perry. History According to local historians, Dekle Beach was acquired and developed by Perry, Florida businessman and politician Gus J. Dekle sometime in the mid 1940s. Mr. Dekle was the owner of Dekle Motor Company, a local Chevrolet dealership, as well as a previous member of the City Council of Perry and a member of the Florida House of Representatives during the 1940s and 1950s. According to some accounts the property had previously been owned by the United States government, and operated as a United States Air Force training facility during World War II (although that information is not verified). However it is known that it was used for salt manufacturing by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. It is also known that Mr. Dekle was the owner of the property when it was developed into its current state as a residential beach area. Previous residents said that Mr. Dekle dredged the channels, dug the canals and developed Dekle Beach into the area that we know and love today. During the residential development period of the beach, Mr. Dekle traded the southernmost point of the beach to his friend, Jimmy Archer, a Texan who had been a long-time resident of Perry, Florida after marrying local resident Sybil Poppell. Mr. Archer was the owner of a local salvage yard and wrecker service that was utilized by Dekle Motor Company, and the land was provided as a barter in return for wrecker services. The descendants of Mr. Archer still live on part of the property to this day. Mr. Lewis Hamilton and his wife, Janis, along with their friends Willie Joe and Ann Moody purchased much of the property as well, and significantly impacted the growth of the community by investing extensive time and effort into developing much of the land into the beautiful residential area currently seen today. This area is still enjoyed by several of their descendants as well, many of whom call Dekle Beach home to this day. The Storm of the Century Dekle was devastated on March 13, 1993 when the ‚ÄúJordan lovely‚Äù (also known as ‚ÄúThe Storm of the Century‚Äù) battered the beach without warning in the wee hours that fateful Saturday morning. Several residents and visitors lost their lives that day, including Mrs. Sybil Archer, the widow of Mr. Jimmy Archer. Although the devastating Storm changed the face of the beach, it didn‚Äôt change the heart of the residents, and the survivors rebuilt their beloved beach from the ground up.

Background As Ibn ·∏§ayyƒÅn preserved in his work KitƒÅb al-Muqtabis fƒ´ tarƒ´kh al-Andalus, the Hungarians (or Magyars), in 942, passed through the Kingdom of the Lombards (northern Italy) and then through southern France, skirmishing along the way. They then invaded Thaghr al-Aq·π£ƒÅ (\\"Furthest March\\"), the northwestern frontier province of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. Through the land of Aquileia, the Hungarians with Kabar auxiliary troops arrived to Italy by the spring of 942. There Hugh of Italy paid the previously agreed annual amount of tax (ten bushels of gold) then sent them to Hispania, according to the account of Liutprand of Cremona. As historian Ferenc Makk claims Hugh hired the Hungarians to a west oriented military campaign because of the Muslims of Fraxinet's continuous raids against his kingdom, including Provence. In addition, Hugh summoned a fleet from the Byzantine Empire in order to destroy the coastal forts in Fraxinet. The battle In early May 942, the Hungarian forces left Pavia for southern France. Just before 20 May, they arrived at Fraxinet, where the battle took place against the Muslims. As friar Ekkehard wrote in his chronicle Casus Sancti Galli (first half of 11th century) among the events from 926 to 937, the skirmish ended when Conrad I of Burgundy (r. 937‚Äì993) sent envoys to both armies warning them of the other. The envoys offered Burgundian aid to each invader against the other and then informed them of the other's whereabouts. When the Magyars and Saracens met, the Burgundians held back and only attacked when the opposing forces were spent. In this way, both invading armies were destroyed and the captives sold into slavery in Arles. Several historians do not accept the above account as credible. Italian historian Gina Fasoli considered that Ekkehard mistakenly confused Hugh with Conrad. Other scholars dated the event to 924, 926, 937, 943, 951 or 954. Makk argues the battle bound to happen during the rule of Conrad, excluding the years 924 and 926. He adds, the minor Conrad resided in the court of Otto I of Germany until early 943, which excludes his role in 937 or 942. The Hungarians led a campaign against the Byzantines in 943, omitting the western military raids. Makk also emphasizes, Conrad did not participate in any major struggles against the Muslims of Fraxinet, including the decisive Battle of Tourtour in 973. However Hugh's victorious naval campaign of 942 against the \\"Saracens\\" is well known in historiography, and during that time, he was in a political-military alliance with the Magyars. In Hungarian history, this was the first documented skirmish against a Muslim enemy. The Magyars defeated the \\"Saracens\\" and they continued on their way to Hispania. Their victory laid the foundation of a successful Italian‚ÄìByzantine campaign against the Muslims in the Mediterranean Sea.

It is a close homologue to the TAF7 gene, although its function may be different. Currently, little is known about this gene. It was originally demonstrated to be a testis-specific gene based on RT-PCR experiments on tissue extracts, however, it has now been found in white and brown adipose tissue,https://elifesciences.org/content/3/e02811 as well as in certain types of cancer. Function =Function in Adipose Tissue Formation= Studies conducted on knockout animals have revealed that Taf7l makes important contributions in determining the fate of mesenchymal stem cells. Importantly, Zhou et al. found that in Taf7L‚àí/‚àí (Taf7L knockout)animals have decreased fat pads that are infiltrated by skeletal muscle tissue. Using RNA-seq and Gene Ontology Enrichment (GO), this same group found that there was an increase in GO terms (and thus gene categories) that werew involved in skeletal and muscle development. Combined with in vitro evidence, it appears that Taf7l is capable of initiating brown fat (the so-called healthy fat) production. Additionally, they found that together with PPARgamma, Taf7l likely can regulate the binding of the TFIID/RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) complex. Specifically, the presence of Taf7l may alter chromatin looping and thus the association of distal enhancer sequences to BAT specific gene promoters, like Cidea and Scd1. =Function in Cancer= Recently, frameshift mutation was found to be present in 3 patients with colorectal cancer. Specifically, a poly-A mono-nucleotide repeat region in Exon 6 of Taf7l was found to be missing one nucleotide (deletion mutation), resulting in a frameshift mutation. It has additionally been found to be decreased in 58% of Acute Myelogenous Leukemai (AML). =Function in spermatogenesis: Reciprocity with TAF7= Much of the initial work came from Pointud et al. They found that Taf7l has dual functionality during spermatogenesis. In early stage spermatocytes, for example in primary spermatocytes (still diploid at this point), TAF7l is located in the cytoplasm, while TATA-binding protein (TBP) complex is located in the nucleus. Then, TAF7l slowly transitions to the nucleus during the mid-stage pachytene cell, where there is also a dramatic increase in TBP protein expression in the nucleus as well. Additionally, there is a reciprocal relationship to that of TAF7 expression: Unlike TAF7l, TAF7 at early stages is expressed in the nucleus, and thus separated from TAF7l. Then, at later stages, when TAF7l transitions into the nucleus, which happens around the time when the somatic (diploid) to germ cell (haploid) transition occurs, TAF7 dramatically declines. This may indicate that TAF7l plays an important role in regulating the TFIID during development of the sperm. Pointud et al. (2003) speculate that TAF7l may \\"bookmark\\" certain genes for expression or repression in the haploid spermatocyte. =Function during Transcription= A definitive role for TAF7l during transcription still remains elusive. Yeast-2-hybrid screens have identified that TAF7l strongly interacts with TAF1 in exactly the same region (amino acids 1170-1226 of TAF1) that TAF7 binds to and inactivates TAF1's acetyltransferase (AT) function. Thus, it is likely that TAF7l shares a similar role to TAF7, in inhibiting TAF1 and thus, the activity of the TFIID complex. TAF7l localizes in a different compartment relative to TBP during early spermatogenesis, implying a TBP-independent function that awaits further study. Additionally, Chromosome Conformation Capture, has identified a role of TAF7 in directly mediating binding of enhancer elements to promoter sequences that TFIID binds to. This further suggests that TAF7l replaces the function of TAF7, as TAF7 has also been demonstrated to bind to and regulate gene (Vitamin D3 or Thyroid Hormone, for example) expression in a promoter specific fashion * References ","title":"TAF7l"},{"id":"53406302","text":"The 305 mm /46 Model 1909 was a naval gun that was the main armament of two classes of Italian dreadnought battleships and one unique dreadnought of the Regia Marina built at the beginning of World War I.

He is best known for having supervised the construction of the first Fort Smith on what was to become the western boundary of Arkansas Territory in 1817‚Äì1818. He served as commander of the new fort from 1818 until February 1822. Biography William Bradford was born in Virginia in 1771. He moved to Kentucky at an unknown date. Settling in Muhlenberg County in 1799, he became a local leader. He won distinctions that included a commission as deputy sheriff, a captaincy in the county militia, and was elected four times to the Kentucky House of Representatives. During the period of hostilities that immediately preceded the War of 1812, Bradford was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a captain. He fought against the British and Native Americans in Ohio, and was wounded at Fort Meigs. He continued his Army service after the war and was promoted to major. As a major, Bradford was selected by General Andrew Jackson in fall 1817 to lead a column of rifle regulars up the Arkansas River to a strategic riverfront strongpoint, Belle Point, where the river crossed what was then the Osage Boundary. This location was deep, at that time, into frontier country. Bradford and 64 men arrived at Belle Point on December 25, 1817 and began to raise a stockade. The fortification became the first Fort Smith on the banks of the Arkansas River. Major Bradford served as the fort commander, and thus as the senior U.S. military officer in what was to become western Arkansas Territory, from December 1817 until his relief in February 1822. Age 50, Major Bradford then entered a retirement-oriented career pathway. It included honors such as his brief appointment, in 1823, as brigadier general of the Arkansas territorial militia. He is usually referred to by his Regular Army rank of major. When he laid down his commissions in 1824, his pension was only $15 per month. The retired major followed the Army to Fort Towson in Indian Territory, a post on the Red River, where he served as a civilian post sutler. The Red River post was afflicted by wetland health conditions, and in October 1826 the sutler fell ill with yellow fever. He died on October 20, and was buried as one of the senior persons interred at Fort Smith National Cemetery.Grave information Today The first Fort Smith was abandoned in 1824 in favor of Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. The foundations of the first Fort Smith survived, however, and are marked within the overall boundaries of the Fort Smith National Historic Site.

After attending high school in Szamos√∫jv√°r (Gherla) and Nagyszeben (Sibiu), he went to the universities of Vienna and Budapest, obtaining a doctorate in law from the latter institution in 1891. The same year, he became a lawyer in Arad. Political activity Pop entered the Romanian National Party (PNR) while still a student, and drew notice for championing the defendants in the 1894 Transylvanian Memorandum trial. In 1895, together with Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti, he represented the Romanians at the Budapest congress of nationalities. Following the PNR's switch to an activist political stance, Pop sat in the Hungarian House of Representatives from 1905 to 1918. He contributed to the press, including the dailies Lupta (Budapest) and Rom√¢nul (Arad). Pop, as a member of the PNR executive, was involved in the process leading up to and following the union of Transylvania with Romania. He attended the party congress in Oradea on 12 October 1918, that adopted the declaration of self-determination for the Romanians and formed an Arad-based action committee that included Pop. On 30 October, he was named president of the Central Romanian National Council, which took control of the increasingly autonomous Transylvania as Austria- Hungary crumbled near the end of World War I. As such, Pop led negotiations between the PNR and the Socialist Party of Transylvania. One day later, on 1 December, Pop was at Alba Iulia, where he served as vice president of the Great National Assembly that proclaimed the union. According to a source, »òtefan Cicio Pop delayed by a couple of hours the opening of the session of the Great National Assembly and held the inaugural address without being asked to or mandated to do so by the elected President of the Assembly, Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti.

Keaton Beach is located at 29.8244¬∞ N, 83.5949¬∞ W. Keaton Beach is 22.5 miles south of the county seat of Perry. Florida's official state tourism website offers the following description of the area, \\"Keaton Beach is an outpost town with a laid-back, relaxing atmosphere. The wild, natural public beach has a shaded picnic area, restrooms, boat ramp and a 700-foot fishing pier. These are prime scalloping waters from mid to late summer, and the area is famous for year 'round fishing.\\" History According to local historians, Keaton Beach was named for Abb and Sam Keaton, two brothers who apparently first settled in the area and who are thought to be its original owners. It is believed that their family originally owned cotton farms in the area, however, their primary source of income gradually shifted as mullet fishing became one of the thriving industries in Taylor County. In the early 1900s, mullet were caught off the Florida coast and residents of south Georgia and north Florida would come to Keaton Beach to buy the fish, which were salted down for use during the winter. Thus mullet became a staple food of the regional diet. The real commercialization of the beach came when Captain W. Alston \\"Cap'n\\" Brown, who owned the turpentine works at Blue Springs Creek, became involved with the area in the early 1920s. The Keaton Brothers were said to have worked with Brown, and he named the Beach in honor of them. Keaton Beach has had several primary owners throughout the years, however it has currently developed into a residential area with homes that are owned by individual families. Early on the community consisted of two houses, a pavilion, a sawmill, a church, a commissary and several workers' houses along Blue Creek Spring. The pavilion was constructed by Captain Brown in the early 1900s, and was passed on to Walter Howard at a later date. By day it was used by Mr. Howard and his partner, Mr. Kelly, as a place to repair their mullet nets. However the pavilion soon became known as a non-commercial place for family and friends to meet in the evenings. One area resident was quoted in a local publication as having said, \\"The pavilion was a fun place to square dance at night.\\" Later the pavilion was used primarily as a fish camp by day and as a dance hall and restaurant by night. The Stephens family purchased the property of Keaton Beach from Clarence Kelly of Madison County, Florida in 1946. In the 1940s the Stephens family frequently visited Keaton Beach as a weekend getaway. However, the Keaton Beach, Inc. company eventually bought a parcel of 337 acres of Taylor County beaches that included the Keaton Beach area from Mr. and Mrs. Stephens. The Keaton Beach restaurant, pavilion and eight cottages were included in the deal. The land area included the frontage on the Gulf as well as Blue Creek. The Storm of the Century Keaton and the surrounding beaches were devastated on March 13, 1993 when the \\"No Name Storm\\" (also known as \\"The Storm of the Century\\") battered the beach without warning early Saturday morning. Several residents and visitors of neighboring Dekle Beach lost their lives that day. Current development Keaton Beach is home to Taylor County's primary public beach area, which includes sandy beaches, a local pier and children's play area known as Hodges Park. Keaton is also home to the county's primary public boat ramp, which is owned and maintained by Taylor County and the Board of County Commissioners. Keaton Beach is also well known for being a premier summer scalloping destination as well as providing an abundance of fishing opportunities for Florida anglers.

It is a ground orchid with a single leaf and up to four white flowers which are often tinged with green or pink. Description Caladenia praecox is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf, long and wide. Up to four white flowers which are often tinged with green or pink, are borne on a spike tall. The backs of the sepals and petals have dark red glandular hairs. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and curves forward, forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are long and wide and spread apart. The petals are long, about wide and spread widely. The labellum is white, often with red marks and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have stalked teeth and the tip is curled under. There are four or six rows of crowded calli in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August and October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia praecox was first formally described in 1926 by William Nicholls and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (praecox) is a Latin word meaning \\"too early ripe\\" or \\"precocious\\". Although recognised by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne as a valid name, C. praecox is regarded as a synonym of Caladenia dimorpha by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Caladenia praecox is widespread in Victoria especially in the Victorian goldfields and is often recorded from areas to the north-east of Melbourne, growing in open forest and woodland. In also occurs in the south-east of New South Wales. Conservation Caladenia praecox is not listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

Members of this gens occur in history toward the end of the Republic, and from then to at least the fourth century. They produced generations of Roman senators, with Gaius Ovinius Tertullus obtaining the consulship toward the end of the second century.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 74 (\\"Ovinius\\"). Origin The nomen Ovinius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other names using the suffix -inius. In this case, it seems to be a patronymic surname derived from the Oscan praenomen Ovius.Chase, pp. 125, 126, 139, 140. Branches and cognomina Among the surnames of the Ovinii were Camillus, Rusticus, and Tertullus. Camillus was an ancient cognomen referring to a youth in the service of a priestly office, and was made famous by the dictator Marcus Furius Camillus during the fourth century BC. Rusticus referred to someone of rural origin or habits. Tertullus is a diminutive of the cognomen Tertius, \\"third\\".Chase, pp. 110‚Äì112.

The state park is surrounded by the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, whose north side is bordered by the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park. Jointly created and managed by the National Park Service and Maryland Park Service, the visitor center opened on March 10, 2017. Building the center =History of the parks= Location (in red) of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park within the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (in yellow). Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in the early 1820s on the plantation of Anthony Thompson near the village of Madison in Dorchester County on Maryland's Eastern Shore. A year or two after she was born, Edward Brodess claimed Tubman, her mother, and her four siblings as an inheritance and took them away to his farm near Bucktown, about to the east. After Brodess died in 1849, Tubman was at risk of being sold. Instead, she fled slavery and moved to Pennsylvania, a state where slavery was outlawed. Over roughly the next decade, Tubman gained national fame by returning to Maryland repeatedly to lead her siblings and other slaves to freedom via what is now called the Underground Railroad. The entire area remained in private hands until 1933, when the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge was established. This protected area encompassed much of the shoreline of the Blackwater River, but did not protect areas such as the Thompson farm, Brodess farm, or other areas important to Tubman's life and the history of the Underground Railroad. On March 9, 2013‚Äîthe 100th anniversary of Tubman's death‚Äîthe State of Maryland and the National Park Service broke ground for a new protected area within the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. This state- owned site lay entirely within the refuge's boundaries on Maryland Route 335. The state designated the land a state park, and named it the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park. The Maryland Park Service and the National Park Service jointly provided funding to construct the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center. On the same date, the State of Maryland unveiled the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Scenic Byway, a route along an existing system of county, state, and federal roads which mirrored the route Tubman took while rescuing slaves. On March 25, 2013, President Barack Obama declared much of the area adjacent to the northern boundary of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge as a national monument. A little under two years later, on December 19, 2014, Congress enacted H.R. 3979, which incorporated the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks Act (H.R.664) as an amendment. This act established the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park as a unit of the National Park Service. The park boundaries are essentially the same as the national monument's, and protect nearly all the important sites associated with Tubman's life. =The visitors' center= Beginning in the 1970s, descendants of Harriet Tubman and her siblings began advocating for a state park to commemorate Tubman, her legacy, and her connection to rural Maryland. In 2007, Maryland acquired adjacent to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge for a park. The onset of the Great Recession significantly hurt both state and federal budgets, stalling any move toward construction of the park. In 2008, Maryland and the National Park Service (NPS) entered into negotiations to jointly create the Tubman park. The two sides reached an agreement in 2009, after the National Park Service endorsed a plan to create national parks at Tubman-associated sites in Maryland and New York. The NPS plan required legislative approval from Congress, but none was immediately forthcoming. The negotiations for a state park nevertheless bore fruit in August 2011. Funding for the , $21 million project came from a state appropriation, several federal grants, and $8.5 million in Federal Transportation Enhancement Program money. Plans called for an exhibit hall with displays, and a garden with a walking trail. The goal was to have the center completed in 2013 in time for the 100th anniversary of Tubman's death. The visitor center and gardens were designed by GWWO, Inc., Architects, an architectural design firm based in Baltimore. Chris Elcock was the lead architect. The buildings were located on the site and oriented to face north, the direction in which Tubman led slaves to freedom. Plans called for four buildings, three dedicated to exhibits and one to house administrative offices. Each of the buildings is shaped like a barn, since Tubman and the slaves she was leading to freedom often slept in barns at night and barns are evocative of the rural architecture of the area. The three exhibit buildings are clad in a light green zinc siding which will dull with time. Zinc was chosen because it is a self-healing material which the architects felt reflected the healing which has gone on since the American Civil War. The administration building is clad in wood. Construction of the buildings utilized a number of craftsman. Building materials included stone and reclaimed wood, and the architectural style featured exposed beams and timbers. The buildings were designed to have windows which featured views of the surrounding wildlife refuge, little of which had changed since Tubman's day. All the structures were designed to be green buildings with at least a LEED Silver certification. The buildings feature geothermal heating and cooling, green roofs, permeable paving in parking areas and on pathways, and solar-powered external lighting. Various construction and funding delays meant that the center did not open in 2013. That year, officials estimated completion in 2015. The 2015 deadline was missed as well, and officials estimated in February 2016 that the facility would finally open in March 2017. The final cost of the state park and visitor center was $22 million. About the center Rear view of the visitors center, showing the distinctive zinc siding of the three exhibit buildings and the wood siding of the administration building. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center is on the grounds of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park. The visitor center consists of of exhibition and administrative spread over four buildings. Visitors enter through a south door, and proceed through a series of corridors and galleries to the north. The initial spaces are narrow and have low ceilings, reflecting the restrictions of slavery. Interior areas become more spacious and feature more natural light as the visitor moves to the north. The west wall of the northernmost building consists of 18 windows of varying shape, each with a different stained glass design depicting a different season of the year. The exhibit halls contains a number of interactive exhibits focused on three themes: The Choptank River area, the local community, Tubman's family, and Tubman's Christian faith; the Underground Railroad; and how Tubman and her activities remain relevant today. Exhibits include a recreation of the corn crib in which Tubman and her brothers hid in 1854' a sculpture depicting the Raid at Combahee Ferry, which Tubman helped lead; and displays about the disguises Tubman used, her method of soundlessly walking through the forest to avoid capture, and her use of spirituals as a means of communication. There is also a small movie theater, which will screen a 10-minute film about Tubman. The administration building provides space for Maryland Park Service and National Park Service personnel. It will also serve as the national headquarters for the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program, which works to promote public understanding about the Underground Railroad and acts as a coordinating umbrella organization for a wide range of private, local, state, and federal Underground Railroad sites. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Visitor Center also features a memorial garden, of walking paths through the local landscape, and a outdoor pavilion. The memorial garden contains three distinctive areas: Closely mowed lawns, meadows of knee-high grass, and woodland consisting of waist-high grass, shrubs, and trees. The garden mimics the kind of concealment (or lack of it) which Tubman and her escapees faced. Two paths lead the visitor through the garden, just as Tubman and escaping slaves often had to choose which path to take. The pavilion features a stone fireplace and picnic tables, and may be reserved by large groups. The state park and visitor center are managed by Dana Paterra of the Maryland Park Service. The National Park Service and Maryland Park Service opened the visitor center on March 10, 2017.

Pleurants or weepers (the English meaning of pleurants) are anonymous sculpted figures representing mourners, used to decorate elaborate tomb monuments, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe. Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this. They may be in relief or free-standing. In English usage the term \\"weepers\\" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the tomb effigy in Tudor tomb monuments. These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.Stone, 146 Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known. In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for Margaret of Bourbon were not begun until 1526 at the earliest. But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.Burk, Jens Ludwig, \\"Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou\\", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) Britain The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter (d. 1206) in Exeter Cathedral.Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452‚Äì53. This has the effigy and weepers in gilt-bronze, and still stands in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, with the \\"xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers\\", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.Stone, 207‚Äì209; the contract  Franco-Burgundian examples  On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles.

Initially, the internet and its precursors, LANs and WANs, were used merely as another media to disseminate jokes and other kinds of humor, in addition to the traditional ones (\\"word of mouth\\", printed media, sound recording, radio, film, and TV).Limor Shifman, \\"Humor in the Age of Digital Reproduction: Continuity and Change in Internet-Based Comic Texts\\", International Journal of Communication, vol. 1, 2007, Quote: \\" A content analysis of 400 humorous texts from eight salient humorous websites shows that the Internet functions both as a ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô of old humor types such as jokes and cartoons and as a ‚Äògenerator‚Äô of new humor types.\\" In lockstep with the progress of electronic communication technologies, jokers took advantage of the ARPANET,Eric S. Raymond, The Art of UNIX Programming, p. 44. Quote: \\"Software, ideas, slang, and a good deal of humor flowed over the experimental ARPANET links. Something like a shared culture began to form\\" e-mail,Trevor J. Blank, Folklore and the Internet: Vernacular Expression in a Digital World, 2009, . Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. Usenet newsgroups (e.g., rec.humor and alt.humor), bulletin board systems, etc, and finally the Whole World Wide Web. Gradually, new forms of humor evolved, based on the new possibilities delivered by electronic means of communication. A popular form of internet humour is found in the form of 'internet memes'. Impact on humor Internet made an impact on humor in several important ways. Similarly to other technical innovations (from printing to TV), Internet significantly increased the speed and the extent of the propagation of humor over the world.Giselinde Kuipers, \\"Good Humor, Bad Taste: A Sociology of the Joke\\", , 2015, pp.41, 42 The joke is a commonly transmitted type of internet meme. It is well-known that orally-transmitted jokes and other kind of folklore undergo evolution and mutations. Internet speeds up and globalizes these processes.Limor Shifman, Mike Thelwall, \\"Assessing Global Diffusion with Web Memetics: The Spread and Evolution of a Popular Joke\\", Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology Vol. 60, Issue 12, pp. 2567‚Äì2576 A FAQ of rec.humor gave the following tongue-in-cheek description how jokes propagated in the era of newsgroups:Rec.humor FAQ (retrieved March 6, 2017) > #Somebody makes up the joke. #The joke spreads to about 50 people. #Somebody > posts it to rec.humor. #Ten thousand people read the joke on rec.humor. > #Eight hundred of these people repeat the joke to somebody. #Twenty of > _those_ people are clueless enough to repost the joke to rec.humor, > apparently lacking either the reading skills to have seen it the first time, > the basic pattern-recognition capability to identify it in its last ten > repetitions, or the short-term memory to realize that it's the same joke > again. #Loop back to step 4, about ten times. #Repeat from step 3 about > every two months. On the opposite side, unlike previous technical means, internet as a whole eliminates censorship and self-censorship of humor. For example, before the Internet extremely sick jokes, such as dead baby jokes, were almost exclusively spread orally. Internet blurred the lines between written and spoken in terms of language use and the directness of speech, between what is permitted in private and in public. Also, YouTube blurred the distinction between a spoken and recorded joke, in that the narrator is actually present. Limor and Lemish observe that internet humor is a part of the participatory culture, where the \\"consumers\\" of jokes may reciprocate by generating and transmitting humor, i.e., act as \\"producers\\" and \\"distributors\\".Limor Shifman, Dafna Lemish, \\"‚ÄúMars and Venus‚Äù in Virtual Space: Post-feminist Humor and the Internet\\", Critical Studies in Media Communication, 28(3), 253-273. (preprint version) New types of humor New possibilities provided by electronic means of communication gave rise to new types of humor. An early example of these is humorous ASCII art. While the precursor of the ASCII art, the \\"typewrite art\\", has been known since 19th century, it was available to few. Whereas ASCII art, including silly one, has become ubiquitous in sig blocks in discussion boards and e-mails. One may find quite a few silly examples in the Jargon File, which also mentions subgenres of ASCII art humor: puns on the letter/character names (e.g., if read \\"B\\" as \\"bee\\" and the caret character (^) as \\"carrot\\", the one may create an ASCII art rebus for a \\"bee in a carrot patch\\") and pictures of \\"silly cows\\" .Eric S. Raymond, The New Hacker's Dictionary, , 1996, pp. 48, 49 The ability to easily manipulate with images and videos combined with ease of the dissemination of them via the Internet introduced new forms of graphical humor, such as lolcats, demotivators, and funny animations.

Headquartered in Santa Barbara, California, Wyatt Technology was founded in 1981 and incorporated in 1984, Wyatt Technology has developed and introduced instrumentation for the measurement of multiangle light scattering (MALS), quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) (also called photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS)), differential refractive index, electrophoresis, viscosity and composition gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) for the determination of the absolute molecular weights and sizes of nanoparticles, proteins and polymers in solution. History Wyatt Technology arose from the ashes of founder Philip J. Wyatt‚Äôs earlier venture, Science Spectrum, Inc. (SSI), which was founded in 1968 to investigate the characterization of bacteria using light scattering. Wyatt used a breadboard instrument developed at SSI to confirm that light scattering could reveal bacterial effects that are not observable with a microscope. Further studies explored the efficacy of antibiotic agents on bacteria. A commercial instrument, the Differential I, was ultimately developed in an attempt to provide convenient and accurate data while still maintaining flexibility necessary in exploring this new field. In order to better test antibiotic susceptibility, SSI developed the Differential III which was one of the first analytical instruments to incorporate an onboard computer and utilized the first batch run of Intel‚Äôs 8008 chips. Although SSI attracted several clients and was awarded several U.S. Government contracts, cash flow problems ultimately led to its collapse. =Wine, Coca-Cola and the company founding= As he wrapped up the business of the company, Wyatt published a letter in Science recounting light scattering patterns of various wines analyzed with the Differential III and correlated the scattering patterns to price and the opinions of the quality of the wine by a panel of local wine enthusiasts. This article drew national attention from various media outlets including an write up in the popular scientific magazine Science News and newspaper articles across the country with titles such as ‚ÄúGrape Nuts! No Loser with Laser,‚Äù by New York Daily News science editor Edward Edelson, and ‚ÄúA Curvy Little wine.‚Äù Wyatt followed up this successful article with a paper in Applied Optics entitled ‚ÄúA Taste of Things to Come,‚Äù in which he reported similar studies on popular cola drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola and RC Cola. The interest in laser fingerprinting of beverages even attracted the attention of science fiction icon Isaac Asimov whose article ‚ÄúNo Accounting‚Äù explained to the lay person just how Wyatt's light scattering experiments worked and how they were being used to classify not only wine but cola drinks as well, and questioned how far this kind of testing could go in determining which competing brand actually ‚Äútasted better,‚Äù and how this type of analysis might be used to aid producers in emulating successful drinks by analyzing and attempting to reproduce their light scattering patterns. In 1983 Ballard Canyon Winery, located in Solvang, California, produced a ‚ÄúLaser Certified‚Äù cabernet sauvignon. The label displayed a laser fingerprint and values including a Body score of 447 and a Structure of 218, and stated, ‚ÄúWe believe this unique laser fingerprint will provide a reference standard of this fine wine for many years to come and permit, thereby, an objective comparison with other vintages.‚Äù Wyatt formed Wyatt Technology Company in 1981 in order to wrap up uncompleted government research contracts as interest in his Science letter continued. National interest in wine fingerprinting and media reports on the Applied Optics cola studies ultimately garnered the attention of the Coca-Cola Company, who engaged the newly founded Wyatt Technology Company and awarded them a contract to study various attributes pertaining to their beverages. The wine studies also caught the attention of S.C. Johnson & Son, who requested an instrument to study the light scattering properties of their wax particles. =New instrumentation= As a result, Wyatt Technology developed the first in its line of DAWN (originally an acronym for ‚ÄúDual Angle Weighted Nephelometry‚Äù) multiangle light scattering instruments. Continuing interest in the DAWN instruments as well as Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts involving the rapid detection of contaminants in water and air spurred the growth of the company which was incorporated as Wyatt Technology Corporation in 1984. Wyatt proceeded to develop batch light scattering instruments (DAWN-B) that made measurements from samples contained within scintillation vials as well as flow through instruments (DAWN-F) for use in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the late 1980s Wyatt purchased the Optilab line of interferometric refractometers from the Swedish company Tekator. =Expansion into the pharmaceutical and protein markets and DynaPro acquisition= In the mid 1990s the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry showed interest in using DAWN instruments coupled with HPLC to measure the molecular weight of proteins, widening the scope of utility of Wyatt instruments which had, up to that time, been primarily used for the characterization of synthetic polymers. In 2004 Wyatt Technology acquired the DynaPro line of dynamic light scattering instruments from bankrupt Proterion. Since this time Wyatt Technology has modernized its instruments into a full line of state-of-the-art particle and molecular characterization tools. Accolades Wyatt Technology is largely notable as a SBIR success story. Begun primarily with SBIR grants, Wyatt Technology has grown to be the largest supplier of multiangle light scattering instruments in the world. Its instruments are used by about 30,000 scientists worldwide, data from the use of their instruments has been published in over 12,000 peer reviewed articles, and have been used in the research of several Nobel Laureates. Wyatt Technology, its founder, and its instruments have received many awards from the scientific and business communities, including the Tibbetts Award in 2011 in recognition visible technological impact on the socio-economic front. Winners of the ‚ÄúTibbie‚Äù exemplify the very best in SBIR achievements. Founder, Philip Wyatt, was granted the American Physical Society‚Äôs prize for ‚ÄúIndustrial Applications of Physics‚Äù for pioneering developments in the inverse scattering problem as well successful and sustained commercialization of analytical instrumentation. Wyatt Technology has been named one of the ‚ÄúBest Places to Work in Industry‚Äù by The Scientist magazine from 2008-2013. Wyatt Technology's Optilab rEX differential refractometer was awarded the 2004 Pittcon Editor's Silver award, and was also named, by R&D; Magazine, one of the top 100 innovative new products of the year. At Pittcon in 2017 Wyatt's HELEOS II MALS detector won Select Science's Reviewers‚Äô Choice Award for Instrument of the Year. In 2013 Wyatt's Optialb UT-rEX was awarded the Innovation Award by ‚ÄúThe Analytical Scientist‚Äù magazine as was the ¬µDAWN in 2014. Wyatt Technology has also been awarded several local business awards including the South Coast Business and Technology Award as ‚ÄúCompany of the Year‚Äù in 2009 and the Spirit of Small Business award in 2004.

Prigozhin was called \\"Putin‚Äôs chef\\" in an Associated Press article because of Prigozhin's restaurants and catering businesses that hosted dinners which Vladimir Putin attended with foreign dignitaries. Prigozhin controls \\"a network of companies,\\" including three accused of interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prigozhin is also accused of attempting to influence the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Prigozhin, his companies and associates face economic sanctions and criminal charges in the United States. According to an investigation by Bellingcat, The Insider and Der Spiegel Prigozhin‚Äôs operations \\"are tightly integrated with Russia‚Äôs Defense Ministry and its intelligence arm, the GRU.\\" Early life Prigozhin was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on 1 June 1961, to Violetta Prigozhina (). He graduated from an athletics boarding school in 1977 and was engaged in cross-country skiing.? Ilya Zhegulyov, \\"The Right to Oblivion,\\" Meduza.June 9, 2016 (in Russian) His father and stepfather were of Russian-Jewish descent, while his mother is of ethnic Russian descent.http://www.compromat.ru/page_33163.htm On 29 November 1979, Prigozhin was given a suspended sentence for stealing (in Leningrad). In 1981 he was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment under articles of robbery, fraud, and involving teenagers in prostitution. Prigozhin spent nine years in prison before he was released. Casino, restaurant and catering career In 1990, after his release, he and his stepfather set up a network to sell hot dogs. Soon, according to a New York Times interview with him, \\"the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them.\\" He also became a 15% stakeholder and manager of a \\"Contrast,\\" started by Boris Spektor (), a classmate from his boarding school, which was the first grocery store chain in Saint Petersburg. Also, Prigozhine as CEO and Spektor and Igor Gorbenko () founded the first casinos in St Petersburg under Spectrum CJSC (). They founded Viking CJSC (), too. In 1995, when revenues began to fall, Prigozhin persuaded a director at Contrast, Kiril Ziminov, to open a restaurant with him. The two men opened the \\"Old Customs House\\" (Russian: –°—Ç–∞—Ä–∞—è –¢–∞–º–æ–∂–Ω—è) in Saint Petersburg. In 1997, inspired by waterfront restaurants on the Seine in Paris, Prigozhin and Ziminov spent $400,000 remodeling a rusting boat on the Vyatka River and started the floating restaurant called New Island, which became one of the most fashionable dining spots in Saint Petersburg. He said his patrons \\"wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka.\\" In 2001, Prigozhin personally served food to Vladimir Putin and French president Jacques Chirac when they dined at \\"New Island\\". He also hosted US President George W. Bush in 2002. In 2003, Putin celebrated his birthday at New Island. By 2003, Prigozhin had left his business partners, established his own independent restaurants, and had become a confidante of Putin, apparently free to engage in illicit activities without fear of prosecution. Garrett M. Graff, \\"Inside the Mueller Agreement\\" Wired, February 20, 2018 His company, Concord Catering, got hundreds of millions in government contracts for feeding school children and government workers. In 2012 he got a contract to supply meals to the Russian military worth $1.2 billion over one year. Some of the profits from this contract are alleged to have been used to start and fund the Internet Research Agency. In 2012 he moved his family into a St. Petersburg compound with a basketball court and a helicopter pad. He has a private jet and a 115-foot yacht. The Anti-Corruption Foundation accused Prigozhin of corrupt business practices. They estimated his illegal wealth to be worth more than one billion rubles. Anti-Corruption Foundation founder Alexei Navalny alleged that Prigozhin was linked to a company called Moskovsky Shkolnik (Moscow schoolboy) that had supplied poor quality food to Moscow schools which had caused a dysentery outbreak. According to Novaya Gazeta in October 2018, Evgeny Arkadievich Gulyaev () is the head of the security service for Prigozhin. On December 11, 2019, which is \\"Heroes Day\\" or \\"Heroes of the Fatherland Day\\", Msk LLC () which has the same phone number as Concord Catering, was paid 4.1 million rubles for a Kremlin banquet. In 2018, Msk LLC was paid only 2.5 million rubles from the Presidential Administration for the exact same banquet at the Kremlin. Wagner Group Prigozhin has been linked to a mercenary group known as the Wagner Group which has been involved in various actions as a private military contractor. On 7 February 2018, Wagner attacked US backed Kurdish forces in Syria in an attempt to take an oil field. Wagner and their allies suffered dozens of casualties when the US responded with airpower. The Washington Post reported Prigozhin was in close contact with Russian and Syrian military officials before the February 7 action.Nathan Hodge, Sebastian Shukla and Mary Ilushina, \\"Putin's 'Chef' Accused of Trying to Cover His Tracks,\\" CNN, 23 February 2018 The connections between Prigozhin and Wagner have been the subject of press coverage in Russia and the United States. Wagner is led by Dmitry Utkin, who was once head of security for Prigozhin. A person by the name of Dmitry Utkin was also listed as Director General of Prigozhin's Concord Management. Since 2011, Prigozhin's mother Violetta Prigozhina has been the owner of Concord. Concord and Prigozhin denied any connection to Wagner, however in November 2016 the company confirmed to Russian media that the same Dmitry Utkin leading the Wagner Group was now in charge of Prigozhin's food businesses. Wagner has also been reported to be fighting in eastern Ukraine with pro-Russia forces. On 30 July 2018, three Russian journalists working for a news organization often critical of the Russian government were murdered in the Central African Republic, where they had been attempting to investigate the activities of the Wagner Group in that country. The Russian government had begun a collaboration with the president of the Central African Republic in October 2017. In its response to the killings, Russia's foreign ministry stressed that the dead journalists had been traveling without official accreditation. Internet Research Agency Prigozhin is alleged to have financed and directed a network of companies including a company called the Internet Research Agency Ltd., () Concord Management and Consulting Company and one other related company. The three companies are accused of Internet trolling and attempting to influence the 2016 US presidential elections and other activity to influence political events outside Russia. Russian journalist Andrey Soshnikov reported that Alexey Soskovets, who had participated in Russian youth political community, was directly connected to the offices of Internet Research in Olgino. His company, North-Western Service Agency, won 17 or 18 (according to different sources) contracts for organizing celebrations, forums and sport competitions for authorities of Saint Petersburg. The agency was the only participant in half of those bids. In the summer of 2013 the agency won a tender for providing freight services for participants of Seliger camp. Despite links to Alexei Soskovets, Nadejda Orlova, deputy head of the Committee for Youth Policy in Saint Petersburg, disputed connection between her institution and the trolling offices. =Spin offs= Campaigns against opposition in 2013 involved Dmitry Bykov and the then head of RIA Novosti, Svetlana Mironyuk, while a homepage claiming to fight fake news (Gazeta O Gazetah) was used to spread fake news.Cook with his cockroaches, Nowaja Gaseta, November 8th 2018 US Treasury Department sanctions On 20 December 2016, the US Treasury Department designated Prigozhin pursuant to E.O.13661 for sanctions for providing support to senior officials of the Russian Federation. In June 2017 US sanctions were imposed on one of Prigozhin's companies, Concord Management and Consulting, in connection with the war in Eastern Ukraine. On 28 January 2018, the US Treasury Department also designated Evro Polis Ltd for sanctions. Evro Polis is a Russian company that has contracted with the Government of Syria to protect Syrian oil fields in exchange for a 25 percent share in oil and gas production from the fields. The company was designated for being owned or controlled by Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The sanctions require that any property or interests in property of the designated persons in the possession or control of U.S. persons or within the United States must be blocked. Additionally, transactions by U.S. persons involving these persons (including companies) are generally prohibited. In September 2019, three more Prigozhin companies (Autolex Transport, Beratex Group and Linburg Industries) were sanctioned in connection with the Russian interference in the 2016 United States election. US criminal charges On 16 February 2018, Prigozhin, the Internet Research Agency, Concord Management, another related company, and other connected Russian individuals were indicted by a U.S. grand jury. He was charged with funding and organizing operations for the purpose of interference with the U.S. political and electoral processes, including the 2016 presidential election, and other crimes including identity theft. Africa interests During 2018 through both 100 to 200 political consultants and Prigozhin's mercenaries in his Wagner Group, Prigozhin established numerous interests in Africa especially in Madagascar and Central Africa Republic (CAR) along with other countries: Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Senegal, Rwanda, Sudan, Libya, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Cameroon, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Mozambique, Nigeria, Chad, South Sudan, and South Africa. Pyotr Bychkov () is responsible for coordinating the \\"Africa expansion\\". =Central African Republic= In the Central African Republic (CAR) southwest prefecture of Lobaye and west of Bangui, the Prigozhin associated company Lobaye Invest has been engaged in the mining of diamonds, gold, and other minerals starting in early 2018. After traveling to Russia in the fall of 2017 to meet with Sergey Lavrov in Sochi and in June 2018 to meet with Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, Faustin-Archange Touadera, the President of the Central African Republic, under advice from his national security advisor Valery Zakharov () increased the Russian presence in CAR by allowing 5 Russian military advisors and 170 Russian contractors to work starting in January 2018 near Bobangui at Berengo, which is the former palace of Jean-B√©del Bokassa and is 60 kilometers southwest of Bangui. Since December 2017, the Kimberley Process allowed diamonds to be mined in the southwest of CAR. Under managing director Evgeny Khodotov () who is associated with security for Touadera through the firm Sewa Security Service, Lobaye Invest was founded through M-Invest by Dmitry Syty () and is a subsidiary of M-Finance which were founded by Prigozhin. On the night of 31 July 2018, three Russian journalists, Alexander Rastorguev (), Orhan Dzhemal (), and Kirill Radchenko (), who were sent by the Mikhail Khodorkovsky-sponsored Investigation Management Center (SDG) (), were killed north of Sibut while they were investigating the operations of Lobaye Invest and Russians interests in the east of CAR at the Ndassima gold field for an upcoming film. On 15 April 2019, Putin sent 30 Russian troops as part of a UN mission in CAR to support Lobaye Invest interests. Financial support for Maria Butina in 2019 During May 2019, Maria Butina appealed for help in paying her attorney fees. In February 2019 Valery Butin (), Masha's father, told Izvestia that she owed her U.S. attorneys 40 million rubles ($659,000). Through Prigozhin's Fund for the Protection of National Values () which is managed by Petr Bychkov, 5 million rubles were donated to Maria Butina's defense attorney costs. She had not been receiving any funds for her defense attorneys fees from Igor Levitin through Konstantin Nikolaev. Financial support for Saif Gaddafi On March 20, 2020, it was revealed that Prigozhin had financially assisted Saif Qaddafi, son of the late overthrown Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, in a bid to win the Libyan Presidency in 2019. Personal life and family Prigozhin is married to a pharmacist () Lyubov Valentinovna Prigozhina (). She owns a network of boutique stores known as the Chocolate Museum () in Saint Petersburg. In 2012, she started her first \\"luxury dayspa\\", the Crystal Spa & Lounge which won a third place award in 2013 for the Perfect Urban Day Spa. Her Crystal Spa & Lounge, located along Zhukovsky Street () in Saint Petersburg, received design support from Valery Uvarov (). She owns a wellness center in the Lenningrad region and a boutique hotel called the Crystal Spa & Residence which won the Perfect Spa Project award in 2013.

Dating from 1916, it was renovated in 2016 to become a live music venue. History Called the New Palace upon opening on November 27, 1916, the theater was designed by Saint Paul architects Buechner & Orth in a Beaux-Arts style. It was built with the surrounding St. Francis Hotel, which also included shops, a ballroom, and the largest single-room billiard hall in the country. The basement was later home to the Granada Club, famous for its Spanish style and known as a gangster hangout. The theater originally seated 2,300 people on the main floor and one balcony, and was part of the Finkelstein & Ruben circuit ‚Äì a large regional chain that developed several other theaters in downtown Saint Paul, including the Princess (1909‚Äì1931) and the Capitol (1920‚Äì1965), as well as the State Theatre in Minneapolis. It made the transition from vaudeville to talkies, and was considered one of the city's two finest movie palaces ‚Äì the other being the Paramount located directly across the street. Over the years the Palace would be affiliated with different production companies, including the Orpheum, RKO, and Ted Mann. First-run feature films were shown from the 1920s until its closure in 1977 due to new competition from both multiplexes and television. In the following years the theater was used only for sporadic events, such as a few live broadcasts of A Prairie Home Companion while the nearby Fitzgerald Theater underwent renovations. While dozens of theaters were built in the early 20th century in downtown Saint Paul, the Palace and the Fitzgerald are the only two that have survived. Renovation The building was dark for three decades and on the verge of condemnation before the City of Saint Paul purchased it in 2015, embarking on a $15 million rehabilitation meant to prepare the venue for concerts. The scope of the project was not a full historical restoration; instead they stabilized the structure and preserved what remained, adding new plumbing and mechanical systems but leaving \\"rough edges\\" throughout. Seats on the main floor were removed to accommodate larger crowds in general admission and differentiate the Palace from other regional venues with similar capacities, including the Orpheum Theatre and Northrop Auditorium in Minneapolis. The balcony's 725 seats were refurbished. The Palace had a public unveiling on December 16, 2016, around the time of its 100th anniversary. Bookings will be handled by First Avenue of Minneapolis and JAM Productions of Chicago. The first show at the renovated theater was March 10, 2017 by Atmosphere, with The Jayhawks and Phantogram also playing opening weekend.

After the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia resulted in the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam conflicted deeply with Thailand due to Thailand's support for the overthrown regime.

The architectural firm of Cope and Stewardson designed the houses in an exuberant Neo-Jacobean version of the Collegiate Gothic style, and completed most of them between 1894 and 1912. The dormitories stretch from 36th to 38th Streets and from Spruce Street to Hamilton Walk (Pine Street). West of the Memorial Tower at 37th Street, the houses on the north side follow the diagonal of Woodland Avenue (now Woodland Walk) and form a long triangle with the houses on the south side. From 1895 to 1971, the dormitories housed only male students. The Quadrangle Dormitories were listed as a contributing property in the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District in 1978. The Quad is now grouped into 3 college houses: Fisher Hassenfeld College House (west), Ware College House (center), and Riepe College House (east).The Quadrangle, from University of Pennsylvania.

Linck, The Quadrangle (University of Pennsylvania Archives, 1990). (PDF) from University of Pennsylvania Archives. Prior to its construction, Penn was largely a commuter school for Philadelphia-area residents; students from elsewhere either lived with Philadelphia relatives or family friends, or found lodgings in off-campus boarding houses. The driving force behind building the dormitory was Charles Custis Harrison, heir to a sugar fortune and university provost, 1894‚Äì1910. He removed the unofficial campus architect, Frank Furness, replacing him with Cope & Stewardson, who were making a reputation as practitioners of the fashionable Collegiate Gothic style.George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works (Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 54‚Äì55. Walter Cope and John Stewardson had designed exquisitely detailed historicist buildings for Bryn Mawr College beginning in the late-1880s, but the Quadrangle would be a project at a far larger scale and with a much higher level of ornament. Provost Harrison took as his model the English college experience of Oxford and Cambridge, where students lived, studied, ate, socialized and worshiped in a single community. Often defraying construction costs with his own funds, Harrison, through Cope & Stewardson, remade the Penn campus with Collegiate Gothic buildings. Built on the former site of the university's athletic fields,A Documentary History of Title to Penn's West Philadelphia Campus, 1870‚Äì1900, from University of Pennsylvania Archives. fifteen of the Quadrangle's houses had been completed by 1897, and six more were added by 1906.

Class of '89, 1909).(PDF) Old Penn and Other Universities charted Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings between 1889 and 1909, but also the near- quadrupling in the size of the student body and the surge in out-of-state and foreign students. Henderson argued that the Quadrangle (then 22 buildings) played a vital role in attracting students, and made an impassioned plea for its expansion: By 1912, the Spruce Street row had been extended to 36th Street and turned the corner to the newly completed Provosts' Tower, honoring the recently retired Provost Harrison.

The rebellion was initiated in 1735, but was put down by Russian troops in 1740 after a series of heavy clashes.  Background  From at least the time of Peter the Great, there had been talk of Russian pushing southeast toward Persia and India. Ivan Kirillov, a Russian commander, drew up a plan to build a fort to be called Orenburg at Orsk at the confluence of the Or River and the Ural River southeast of the Urals where the Bashkir, Kalmyk and Kazakh lands join. Construction was started at Orsk in 1735, but by 1743 'Orenburg' was moved about 250 km west to its present location. The next planned step was to build a fort on the Aral Sea. This would involve crossing the Bashkir country and then the lands of the Kazakh Lesser Horde, some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission. However, a significant portion of the Bashkir population resented this plan.  Rebellion  Kirillov's plan was approved on May 1, 1734 and he was placed in command. He was warned that this would provoke a Bashkir rebellion, but the warnings were ignored. He left Ufa with 2,500 men in 1735 and fighting started on the first of July. The war consisted of many small raids and complex troop movements, so it cannot be easily summarized. For example: In the spring of 1736, Kirillov burned 200 Bashkir villages, killed 700 rebels in battle and executed 158. An expedition of 773 men left Orenburg in November and lost 500 from cold and hunger. During the time, the Bashkir rebels planned to massacre the sleeping Russians at Seiantusa. The ambush failed. In retaliation, one thousand villagers, including women and children, were put to the sword and another 500 driven into a storehouse and burned to death. Raiding parties then went out and burned about 50 villages and killed another 2,000. Eight thousand Bashkirs attacked a Russian camp and killed 158, losing 40 killed and three prisoners who were promptly hanged. Bashkir rebels also attacked Bashkirs loyal to Russia. But number of Bashkirs loyal to Russia was small and amounted to approximately 150.–ê–∫–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ò. –ì. –ë–∞—à–∫–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è XVII‚ÄìXVIII –≤–≤. –§–µ–Ω–æ–º–µ–Ω –≤ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–∏. - –£—Ñ–∞: –ö–∏—Ç–∞–ø, 2016. –°—Ç—Ä. 191 Leaders who submitted were sometimes fined one horse per household and sometimes hanged. All this was at the time of Empress Anna of Russia and the Russo-Turkish War (1735‚Äì1739). The rebellion was finally put down in 1740.  Aftermath  Although the history of the Bashkir rebellion cannot be easily summarized, its results can be: * Russian imperial goal of expansion into Central Asia was delayed due to the Bashkir problem. * Bashkiria was pacified in 1740. * Orenburg was established. * The southern side of Bashkiria was fenced off by the Orenburg Line of forts. It ran from Samara on the Volga east up the Samara River to its headwaters, crossed to the middle Ural River and followed it east and then north on the east side of the Urals and went east down the Uy River to Ust-Uisk on the Tobol River where it connected to the ill-defined 'Siberian Line' along the forest-steppe boundary. * In 1740 a report was made of Bashkir losses during the rebellion. According to the report, 16,893 Bashkir rebels were killed, 3,236 were captured and forcibly conscripted (they were sent to Baltic regiments and fleet), and a further 8,382 women and children were distributed (presumably as serfs), putting the total Bashkir losses at 28,511. Moreover, 12,283 horses, 6,076 cattle and sheep and 9,828 rubles were extracted from the rebellious Bashkirs as fines. Furthermore, at least 1,175 Bashkir villages were destroyed. As this was compiled from army reports, it excludes losses from irregular raiding, hunger, disease and cold. All this was from an estimated Bashkir population of 100,000. * According to Vasily Tatishchev total losses among Bashkirs amounted to 60,000.

Early life He was the third son of a prominent pastoralist, Price Maurice, and was born at Fourth Creek in 1859 (a tributary of the Torrens River which runs through Adelaide). At the early age of two or three, his family moved to Bath in England. He attended Somerset College for his education, and in 1876 began farming at Dorset. He travelled to the United States as a young man to visit some of his father's properties, then spent one year in New Zealand sheep farming. On arrival back in Australia, he spent two years inspecting his father's properties on the west coast, then returned to Fourth Creek. In his early 20s, Maurice tried his luck in the Kimberley goldfields in the 1880s but serious illness forced his return to Adelaide for a period of convalescence. Once recovered Richard Thelwell Maurice headed to Fowlers Bay where he found work with George Murray, a personal friend and manager of the nearby Yalata Station. During this period, Maurice established himself as a kangaroo hunter on the Nullarbor Plain.Gara, T (1989). The Aborigines of the Great Victoria Desert: The ethnographic observations of the Explorer Richard Maurice ‚Äì Journal of the Anthropological Society of South Australia ‚Äì Vol 27 No 5 July 1989 On his father's death in 1894, Maurice received a substantial inheritance from the estate enabling him to quit Kangaroo-hunting and pursue the exploration of the desert wilderness beyond the northern edge of the Nullarbor Plain. Exploration From a new base at Fowlers Bay on the Great Australian Bight, Maurice spent the years 1897 and 1898 searching north of the Nullarbor Plain and the Great Victoria Desert, noting the position of Aboriginal water holes, while maintaining a keen lookout for evidence of gold bearing rocks. In late 1898 he ventured further north to the Everard Ranges collecting Aboriginal artifacts and returned in April the following year. In 1901 a longer expedition took him to the Rawlinson Ranges in Western Australia to explore the region between the tracks of Ernest Giles in 1875 and the Elder Expedition of 1891‚Äì92. He was joined by the government surveyor William Murray whose task was to accurately record water supplies. Other members were William Voake (general hand and cook), Lambert (part Aboriginal cameleer) and his wife. It was during this expedition that Voakes Hill was named. The year 1902 was the most testing trek for Maurice and his small party, venturing from Fowlers Bay in April, to the distant Wyndham in the north-west of the continent. Personnel on this expedition were R.T. Maurice (leader), W. Murray (surveyor), H. Hausscheldt (cook and general hand), Khasta Khan (Afghan camel handler), Munjena (indigenous assistant to Maurice), plus two trackers, Yarrie and Peter. The party started with 14 camels, but six days after departing Tallaringa, Khan absconded with the best camel. They lost a further six along the way through eating poison bush Gastrolobium. Drought conditions prevailed and lack of water was a constant concern. The route was via Tallaringa to the Everard Ranges, Musgrave Ranges, Ayers Rock (Uluru), Tanami Desert, Sturt Creek, Halls Creek and Wyndham. The expedition mapped waterholes, collected mineral samples and ethnographic specimens. They reached Sturt Creek on 25 August and arrived at Wyndham in October 1902. Maurice made one final expedition into the country north of Ooldea in 1903 however his arduous life in the bush had left him debilitated and he retired to Sydney later that year.Gara, T 1994. \\"Tackling the back country\\": Richard Maurice's expeditions in the Great Victoria Desert 1897-1903 - South Australian Geographical Journal Vol 93 (1994) P42 - 60https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/163034978?searchTerm=R.T.%20Maurice&searchLimits;=dateFrom=1903-10-10dateTo=1903-10-10 Epilogue In 1904 Maurice's journals were published in the South Australian Parliamentary Papers, and numerous specimens were presented to the South Australian museum. In 1909 he was planning another journey from Fowlers Bay, having travelled there a few weeks earlier, but died of heart failure before preparations were complete.

Danforth, founder of the Ralston Purina Company, and his wife. The Danforth Foundation focused on national education philanthropy: providing scholarships to college students, supporting projects to revitalize the city of St. Louis, and funding the Danforth Chapels. (The Danforth Foundation closed in 2011 with a gift of $70M to the Donald Danforth Plant Center, a research center that focuses on solving world hunger.) The Danforth Chapel Program supported the establishment of 24 chapels: 15 chapels on college and university campuses and nine other chapels. The chapels and the chapel program emphasized Christian faith in chapel designs but designs and chapels did accommodate for other faiths. The foundation's first requirement was that each chapel include religious (predominantly Christian) images, such as Heinrich Hoffman's Christ in the Garden. The second requirement was that each include a plaque with an inscription: > Dedicated to the worship of God with the prayer that here in the communion > with the highest those who enter may acquire the spiritual power to aspire > nobly, adventure daringly, serve humbly. The third requirement was that the Danforths have a say in the design of each chapel. Most of the Christian iconography in the chapels has been removed to ensure that the spaces are not religiously specific and to welcome groups of other faiths to use the chapel spaces. 24 Danforth All-Faith Chapels Each chapel has its own architect, history, location, and story. Three chapels (at North Carolina State University, Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, and Wartburg College) have been demolished to make room for other building. William Danforth's vision statement‚Äî\\"Aspire Nobly ‚Ä¢ Adventure Daringly ‚Ä¢ Serve Humbly\\"‚Äîis engraved on a plaque in each of the Danforth Chapels. An article from the dedication of the Danforth Chapel at the University of Chattanooga states that a chapel was being built in South America, but the Danforth archives reflect chapels in the U.S. with one in Japan and one in India. (Lists of the chapel locations are incomplete; research also reflects a Danforth Chapel at Southern Mississippi University, but sources of information are limited.) Several sources state that the Danforth Foundation funded 24 chapels. Each of the 24 chapels are introduced below. =Camp Miniwanca Danforth Chapel (1941)= William Danforth was one of four progressive leaders who founded the American Youth Foundation and established the first of its two camps‚ÄîCamp Miniwanca‚Äîin Shelby, Michigan. (Danforth's influence is evident in the American Youth Foundation's logo, similar to that of the Ralston Purina Corporation, and the vision statement‚Äî\\"Aspire Nobly ‚Ä¢ Adventure Daringly ‚Ä¢ Serve Humbly\\"‚Äîis iterated in the Miniwanca archives of the original founders' newsletters to campers, The Founders-Four Folder.) These founders focused on a Christian perspective but the youth foundation has shifted to accept a variety of faiths. The Danforth Chapel at Camp Miniwanca was started in 1936 and completed 1941. The chapel is a small meditation chapel of stone built on a wooded dune near the camp's Church of the Dunes. The founder of the American Youth Foundation describes the chapel in a published manual: > Come with me to the little stone Chapel that stands on the dune-side at > Miniwanca! > ‚ÄîRuggedly plain, masoned of stone from nearby fields, harmoniously it blends > with the soft foliage of surrounding woods; > ‚ÄîArched doors and windows, and a tower d [sic] roof add grace and beauty to > its symmetric lines; > ‚ÄîRoof beams, hand hewn, plain seats of oak, and rough tiled floor give > strength and dignity within; > ‚ÄîOn raised altar, plain built and strong, there stands The Cross, illumed by > candle flame on right and left; > ‚ÄîAnd just above, a dossal of blood red hue, to bring relief to wide expanse > of solid wall; > ‚ÄîIn tiny northex hands the Gethsemane portrait of Him whose name youth > enters here to meditate and pray.... The Danforth Chapel is reported to be the final resting place for Mr. William H. Danforth and Mrs. Adda B. Danforth; their ashes rest in a crypt in the chancel of the small Miniwanca Danforth Chapel. (An additional memorial site exists in St. Louis, Missouri.) =Berea College Danforth Chapel (1938)= Berea College, located in Berea, Kentucky, is home to the second Danforth Chapel, built in 1938. This Gothic-style building was intended to demonstrate the relationship between spirituality and education. The Berea Danforth Chapel was designed by architects James P. Jamieson, George Spearl, and Charles Cellarius. The chapel's walls contain 54 stones from various spiritual and international landmarks and leaders, all gifted to Danforth. The stones, which represent victories throughout the world and include stones from Abraham Lincoln's Tomb in Springfield, Illinois; Washington Monument in Washington, DC; the palace of King Sargon II in Khorsabad, Iraq; Omi, Japan; Canterbury Cathedral in Scotland; the Old Wall in South Korea (Fortress Wall of Seoul); the Roman Forum in Italy; Nazareth, Israel (from the vicinity of Christ's carpenter shop); India from Mahatma Gandhi; Liddar Valley in Kashmir, India; marble from North Korea; and Mount Danforth in Antarctica. The chapel, a part of the Berea Campus Christian Center, serves as a place for meditation, weddings, memorial services, and small concerts. =Pilgrim Danforth Chapel (1941)= The Danforth Chapel at Pilgrim Congregational Church United Church of Christ in St. Louis, Missouri, is built adjacent to the main sanctuary. William Danforth and his family were church members at Pilgrim Congregational Church. =University of Kansas Danforth Chapel (1946)= University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, is home to a Danforth Chapel that was completed and dedicated in 1946. The chapel, which seats 90, is maintained by an endowment fund through the university but was originally funded by a $5000 donation from the Danforth Foundation and was funded and furnished through donations from faculty students, faculty, and residents of the city of Lawrence. The chapel was designed by Edward W. Tanner (the first architectural engineer graduating from University of Kansas) and J. C. Nichols Co. and built partly by German prisoners of war (POW) who were masons being detained in a POW camp near Lawrence. The chapel was expanded and renovated with a $850,000 addition in Fall 2007; the renovation included restorations, new tile, paint, and an organ. The Danforth Chapel continues to be a place for meditation, small services, and weddings. With 14 other historic buildings in the East Historic District of University of Kansas, the Danforth Chapel has been registered in the National Register of Historic Places. =Arizona State University Danforth Chapel (1948)= Arizona State University (ASU), located in Tempe, Arizona, completed the construction of the campus' Danforth Chapel in 1947 and dedicated the chapel on February 26, 1948. William H. Danforth donated $5,000 to the campus, with the students raising the remaining $10,000 for the construction of the chapel through additional donations and fundraisers. The ASU Danforth Chapel, like many of the other Danforth Chapels, has been used for several weddings and religious ceremonies, as well as a place for rest and meditation. The builders installed a cross on the chapel because of a miscommunication in the plans, but a student removed the cross before the chapel's dedication. The cross was reinstalled, however in 1990, the American Civil Liberties Union filed and won a lawsuit to remove the cross. (Which now is housed in the archives in the Hayden Library.) As many as 25 religious organizations continue to use the Danforth Chapel for services and events. In 2008, Arizona State University celebrated the Danforth Chapel's 60 years by inviting the first chapel organist Jean Reaves-Clark, the first groom Colonel Billie Stephens (who married Dorothy McKenzie in 1948), and a Danforth Foundation \\"Danny Grad\\" Genie Hopper Zavaleta (1948 graduate) to be part of the event. =Kansas State College Danforth Chapel (1949)= The construction of the Danforth All-Faith Chapel at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, was completed in 1949.

The chapel is a small red-brick building with a white cupola, and it sits next to the Iowa River. It continues to be a place for student weddings and meditation. =Bethesda General Hospital, St. Louis, MO (1954)= Bethesda General Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, was founded in 1889 by Dr. Edward W. Saunders and Mr. and Mrs. Roger Hayne as a refuge for orphaned and abandoned children. The hospital moved to its present building in 1954, and, on July 11, 1954, the Danforth Foundation and the hospital dedicated the hospital's Danforth Chapel.

She is based in San Francisco, California.  Career  Heather Day grew up in Hawaii and along the East Coast of the United States. She graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2012 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Painting. Following graduation, she moved to San Francisco to expand her studio practice. Early in her career and after her graduation, she was outspoken about her use of social media for the promotion of the arts which was not common at that time.  Work  Day considers her work a form of visual storytelling, where each painting acts as a page to a larger story about ‚Äúrisk and comfort.‚Äù Citing the lines and textures of nature, travel, music and the depth of the color blue as her main sources of inspiration, Day works primarily with paint and non-traditional materials on canvas. She also works in both interior and exterior murals and experimental sculpture. Day painted a commissioned mural at the Dropbox office in Seattle, conveying movement and creating her own canvas by painting over existing design elements such as a moose head sculpture. Aside from working with traditional painting materials, Day used her process to create the world's first augmented reality art for Facebook Camera in collaboration with Facebook's Applied Machine Learning group. Using her social media platform as a vehicle for community discussion, Day addresses feminism, current political events and their impacts on the community, and entrepreneurship. Day regards Helen Frankenthaler, Katharina Gross, Sam Gilliam, Agnes Martin, Willem DeKooning and Noah Purifoy as admirable artists.

Many notable rappers such as RZA (of the Wu-Tang Clan), Kanye West, and Frank Ocean have taken inspiration from anime when creating their music. In mid-2015 Canadian rapper Sese, aka Lord Frieza, caught the attention of this subgenre when he released his mixtape The Frieza Saga, which was entirely inspired by Dragon Ball Z. \\"One of my friends was talking about how epic the battles on Dragon Ball Z were and then we started talking about how crazy the parallels between hip-hop and the show are,\\" Sese explains.  Hip hop's influence on anime  Since the early 1960s, anime has become increasingly more profitable in Western countries. The growth of the Internet provided Western audiences an easy way to access Japanese content. This has seemingly influenced many anime creators to incorporate more Western culture in their productions. The Western market has influenced the creation of many popular hip-hop inspired anime titles such as Afro Samurai, Samurai Champloo, Tokyo Tribes, PaRappa the Rapper, and Detroit Metal City.

Gagnepain's 1943 paper is now available online (page 67), and does not mention this species. At the time of writing (2017) the Plant List refers to C. erecta (Pierre) Burret as an accepted name with 8 accessions in the Kew herbarium catalogue also under the latter name . The Vietnamese name is ch√†m ron (sometimes b·ªì an is used, but this is better applied to C. auriculata); in Khmer it is t√∂ngoor. Description Colona evecta was described from southern Vietnam, it is also found in neighbouring provinces of Cambodia, where the species often survives forest clearing. The tree grows from 6-20m, with radiating pubescent branches and terminal flowers. The bark of young trees is very tough.

Garc√≠a Ponce is best known for his abstract paintings and collages, most of which utilize structured and geometric forms rather than organic shapes.  Life  Garc√≠a Ponce was born in M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico on August 25, 1933 to Juan Garc√≠a Rodes, immigrant from Spain, and Mar√≠a \\"Monina\\" Ponce G. Cant√≥n, a member of the so-called \\"casta divina\\" of Yucat√°n. At the age of 11, Garc√≠a Ponce's family moved to Mexico City. In 1952, Garc√≠a Ponce enrolled at the National Autonomous University of Mexico to study architecture. In 1967, Garc√≠a Ponce met the French Canadian actress Denise Brosseau, who had previously been married to Alejandro Jodorowsky. Brosseau and Garc√≠a Ponce married and had one child, Esteban Garc√≠a Brosseau. On July 11, 1987, Garc√≠a Ponce died of a heart attack in Coyoac√°n, Mexico City; Garc√≠a Ponce was 54 at the time. His elder brother, Juan Garcia Ponce, was a well known author and has published works about his brother's art and life.  Works  Garcia Ponce is part of a generation of artist that began to seek new creative option after 1945. In Mexico this desire to create a new tradition was particularly difficult in Mexico, because of the omnipresence of the \\"three great\\" muralist: Siqueiros, Rivera and Orozco. Garcia Ponce and other painters of his generation felt the necessity to establish the independence of painting towards any type of social or political program. After traveling to Paris in his youth Garcia Ponce assimilated the philosophical background that characterized Informalism in France and Abstract Expressionism in the U.S. of which he appreciated the freedom. Nonetheless his formation as an architect undeniably influenced his painting in which geometry and structure are essential components even if treated lyrically. Garcia Ponce first teacher was the Spanish painter Enrique Climent who took him as his only student. Garc√≠a Ponce's artwork was first inspired by the cubist experience. The artist chose to work through depersonalization and the search of purity. Later, he became more focused in exploring the balance between form and space. His goal was to push his artwork past its initial appearance to the viewer. Garc√≠a Ponce has allowed for his paintings to speak for themselves. His artworks are living spaces animated by the artist's spirit. ‚ÄúSince his first exhibition, Fernando Garcia Ponce showed that his paintings could be presided over by a sign of rigor. Influenced by cubism, his early works clearly displayed the feeling that had determined the choices of painters before him. Before Braque or Picasso, the memory of Juan Gris. Facing the temptation to include the complete reality of the object in the closed atmosphere of the painting, facing the creative liberty and the will to transform, the painter would choose depersonalization, the search of final purity of which is capable of formal representation. His cubism was, in the most profound sense, analytic.‚Äù ‚ÄúHis paintings are simple and difficult, empty spaces, spaces made alive through the presence of the creator‚Äôs spirit that becomes incarnated in the work.‚Äù Some of his works are: * Self-portrait (1951) * Natural Death (1959) * Painting A-63 (1963) * Bottling Peninsula, ca (1966) * Relief and Space (1970) * Homage to Picasso (1976) * Glory and Death (1980) * Horizontal Composition with Red Point (1986) References * Ponce, Juan Garc√≠a.

He briefly served as chancellor during Later Han.  Background  Assuming that Li Tao died in 961, he would be born in 898, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from Wannian (), one of the two counties making up the Tang dynasty capital Chang'an.History of Song, vol. 262. He was a 10th-generation descendant of Li Yi (), an uncle of Tang's founding emperor Emperor Gaozu, and was a great-grandnephew of the Tang chancellor Li Hui.Li Tao's biography in the History of Song actually indicated that this 10th generation ancestor was Li Wei (ÊùéÁëã) and was a son of Emperor Jingzong, but this account seems implausible given that Emperor Jingzong's reign was from 809 to 827 (less than 100 years prior to Li Tao's birth), and his own biography and the biographies of his sons did not indicate that he had a son named Li Wei. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 17, part 1 and 175. The account used here is based on the Zizhi Tongjian, which asserted that Li Tao was a great-grandnephew of Li Hui's, and the Old Book of Tang, vol. 173, which indicated that Li Hui was a descendant of Li Yi's. See also New Book of Tang, vol. 70, part 1, which gave Li Yi's family tree and included Li Tao as a descendant. His grandfather Li Zhen () served as a county magistrate, while his father Li Yuan () served as the director of palace construction (Â∞á‰ΩúÁõ£, Jiangzuo Jian). He had at least one younger brother, Li Huan (), who would later be known for literary capabilities. In 907, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong seized the throne, ending Tang and establishing Later Liang. Li Yuan, as he was a member of Tang's imperial clan, feared that disaster would come to him, and therefore took Li Tao to the land of Later Liang's vassal state Chu to look for refuge from Chu's ruler Ma Yin. Ma commissioned Li Tao as the magistrate of Hengyang County (Ë°°ÈôΩ, in modern Hengyang, Hunan). Li Tao's cousin Li Yu () served in the Later Liang imperial guards and apparently informed Zhu about Li Yuan's and Li Tao's flight to Chu. Zhu ordered Ma to send Li Yuan and Li Tao back to Later Liang proper, and made Li Tao the magistrate of Heyang County (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang, Henan).  During Later Tang  Early in the Tiancheng era (926-930) of Later Liang's successor state Later Tang's emperor Li Siyuan, Li Tao passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi () class, and thereafter became an assistant to the prefect of Jin Prefecture (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), and later successively served as an imperial censor with the title of Jiancha Yushi (), and then You Bujue (), a consultant at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). When Li Siyuan's son Li Conghou the Prince of Song was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Tao was made his assistant in his role as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi).Li Conghou became the military governor of Tianxiong in 931 and was recalled back to the capital Luoyang to succeed his father in 933, so Li Tao's service under him must have been during those years. See Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 45 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. After about a year of serving at Tianxiong, Li Tao was recalled to the imperial government to serve as an imperial chronicler (Ëµ∑Â±ÖËàç‰∫∫, Qiju Sheren).  During Later Jin  In 936, Later Tang was destroyed and succeeded by Later Jin, with Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang becoming emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In this new administration, Li Tao received the titles of Kaogong Yuanwailang (ËÄÉÂäüÂì°Â§ñÈÉé, a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu)) and editor of imperial history (Âè≤È§®‰øÆÊí∞, Shiguan Xiuzhuan). In 937, when the general Zhang Congbin () rebelled against Shi, but was then quickly defeated, one of Zhang Congbin's chief co-conspirators was Zhang Jizuo (). When Shi was set to slaughter Zhang Jizuo's clan on account of his treason, Li cited the fact that Zhang Jizuo's father Zhang Quanyi had been a great benefactor to the people in rebuilding Luoyang to beg Shi to spare his clan; Shi agreed, and ended up limiting the executions to Zhang Jizuo's wife and children.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. There was a subsequent time when Li served as an imperial emissary to Song Prefecture (ÂÆãÂ∑û, in modern Shangqiu, Henan) to review the farms of the prefecture to revise the taxes to be levied there. The official Yuan Zhengci (), who had an estate at Song, sent Li a gift of textile, trying to get Li to overlook his estate. Li instead revealed this to Shi, who honored him for his honesty. As a result, Yuan was demoted a rank, and Li was made the magistrate of Junyi County (), one of the two counties making up the Later Jin capital Kaifeng. He later was made Bibu Langzhong () and then Xingbu Langzhong (ÂàëÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠, both supervisory positions at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu)), while also serving as an assistant to the director of salt and iron monopolies specifically dealing with salt monopoly. In 941, there was an infamous incident where Zhang Yanze the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu) executed his secretary Zhang Shi () cruellyZizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. and, after Zhang Shi's death, took Zhang Shi's wife as a concubine. After Zhang Shi's father Zhang Duo () went to Shi Jingtang's then-location Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, i.e., Tianxiong's capital) to plead to the emperor about what happened to his son, Shi removed Zhang Yanze from his post as military governor of Zhangyi. However, even though Zhang Yanze's successor Wang Zhou () then reported that Zhang Yanze had committed 26 crimes at Zhangyi (in addition to what he did to Zhang Shi), Shi took no further actions against Zhang Yanze, on account of Zhang Yanze's past battlefield accomplishments and the fact that Zhang Yanze was related by marriage with the powerful general Yang Guangyuan. A number of officials, including Li, complained bitterly, going as far as to prostrate themselves in front of the palace to plead that Zhang receive the death penalty. When Shi summoned Li to his presence, Li spoke harshly in tone and words, drawing Shi's anger, and Shi ordered him to leave. Li initially did not withdraw and continued arguing, causing Shi to respond, \\"I already promised to Zhang Yanze that he would not die.\\" Li responded, \\"Your Imperial Majesty does not want to turn against your words promising life to Zhang Yanze. But, where is Fan Yanguang's iron certificate [(i.e., promise of life)]?\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. (This was a reference to how Fan had rebelled against Shi but was induced into surrendering by promise of an iron certificate guaranteeing his life, but Shi had later subsequently implicitly permitted Yang to have Fan killed.) In anger, Shi walked away. Li subsequently returned to Luoyang and wrote a poem lamenting this incident. When Shi Jingtang died later in the year and was succeeded by his adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui, Li was accused of not visiting the emperor's casket, and was removed from his post. Soon, he was recalled to government service to serve as the magistrate of Luoyang County (the other county making up Luoyang). He then successively served as Tuntian Langzhong (Â±ØÁî∞ÈÉé‰∏≠, a supervisory official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu)), and then Zhifang Langzhong (ËÅ∑ÊñπÈÉé‰∏≠, a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu)), and then Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫, a mid-level official at the legislative bureau).  During the Liao incursion  Around new year 947, Later Jin was destroyed by the Khitan Liao dynasty's Emperor Taizong ‚Äî with Zhang Yanze, who had surrendered to Liao, serving as Emperor Taizong's forward commander in taking Liao troops into the Later Jin capital Daliang. Zhang executed a number of Later Jin officials that he had grudges with. Li Tao, believing that he could not escape, decided to go see Zhang, sending a note requesting a meeting and stating, \\"Li Tao, who had requested that the Taiwei [(Â§™Â∞â, the title that Zhang carried in the Liao government)] be executed, is requesting an audience and asking for death.\\" Zhang gladly received him and stated, \\"Are you afraid now, Sheren?\\" Li responded, \\"Tao's fear today is like the fear that Your Honor had then. If Emperor Gaozu [(i.e., Shi Jingtang)] had followed my words, how can such things happen?\\" Zhang laughed, drank with him, and released him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  During Later Han  = During Liu Zhiyuan's reign = Emperor Taizong claimed to be the emperor of China as well, but soon, there were numerous rebellions that rose against him, and he withdrew from Daliang. The most prominent of the rebels was Liu Zhiyuan, who declared himself emperor of a new state later known as Later Han at his base at Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. When Liu approached Luoyang, Li Tao, along with the other Later Jin officials, went to Luoyang to welcome him, Liu inquired of him of the status of the imperial treasury in light of the Liao incursion. Li was able to give a detail report, and Liu was pleased by his knowledge. Once Liu entered Daliang, he made Li an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). (Meanwhile, Li Tao's brother Li Huan was taken to Liao proper, and later served as an imperial scholar under Emperor Taizong's nephew Emperor Shizong and son Emperor Jingzong.) Later in 947, Liu, who had initially upon his uprising made his staff members Su Fengji and Su Yugui his chancellors, was considering naming additional chancellors. When he asked Su Fengji for recommendations, Su Fengji, who was friendly with Li, recommended Li, pointing out Li's earlier insistence for Zhang Yanze's death that Liu agreed with. At that time, it happened that Liu was facing the problem of the rebellion of Du Chongwei at Yedu, with the generals that Liu sent to attack Du, Gao Xingzhou and Murong Yanchao, having discord among themselves. Li submitted a petition asking Liu to head to Yedu to oversee the siege himself, and Liu was pleased with the proposal and found Li to be wise. Liu thereafter named both Li and Dou Zhengu chancellors with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), with Li receiving additional titles of minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu) and Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. = During Liu Chengyou's reign = In 948, Liu Zhiyuan died and was succeeded by his son Liu Chengyou. Early in Liu Chengyou's reign, the high-level officials were in a collective leadership, with different responsibilities. However, Yang Bin, as chief of staff (Shumishi), oversaw the government overall,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. and when the chancellors, led by Su Fengji, wanted to promote officials and fill unfilled positions, Yang saw the requests as wasteful and often rejected them, causing the chancellors to be displeased. In spring 948, Li Tao submitted a petition to Liu Chengyou suggesting that Yang and Guo Wei (who was then deputy chief of staff) be given military commands outside the capital and that key matters be decided by Su Fengji and Su Yugui. When Yang and Guo heard of this, they went to see Liu Chengyou's mother (Liu Zhiyuan's wife) Empress Dowager Li, stating to her, \\"Your subjects have followed the deceased emperor ever since difficult times. Now, the Son of Heaven is accepting other people's word and wants to send us out. Given that there are troubles west of the pass [(i.e., in the Guanzhong region, where the general Wang Jingchong was fostering a rebellion)], how can we, your subjects and ignore the affairs of the state? If we are not to remain, we hope to at least remain until the deceased emperor's burial.\\" Empress Dowager Li was angered, and she went to Liu Chengyou, stating to him, \\"These are the old and accomplished subjects of the state. Why are you listening to others and expelling them?\\" When Liu Chengyou blamed the matter on the chancellors in general, Li Tao took the blame by himself, and was relieved of his chancellor position.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. By late 950, Liu Chengyou himself had tired of the control the senior officials had on his government. He thereafter had Yang, Shi Hongzhao the commander of the imperial guards, and Wang Zhang the director of the financial agencies executed. Guo was, at that time, serving as the defender of Yedu, and therefore not killed, but Liu had Guo's family, as well as the family of Guo's assistant Wang Jun, slaughtered. When Guo thereafter rebelled and attacked Daliang, Empress Dowager Li lamented, \\"I did not accept Li Tao's words. Now we are facing destruction.\\" Thereafter, Liu tried to engage Guo in battle, but was killed in battle. Guo entered Daliang and, after persuading Empress Dowager Li that he would continue to treat her as a mother, she ordered that the throne be yielded to him. Guo took the throne and established Later Zhou. (Liu Zhiyuan's younger brother Liu Chong claimed the Later Han throne at Hedong, but his state is considered by traditional historians to be a new state known as Northern Han.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.  During Later Zhou  Guo Wei gave Li Tao the title of Taizi Binke (Â§™Â≠êË≥ìÂÆ¢ ‚Äî advisor to the Crown Prince, but completely honorary as a title as there was no crown prince at the time). In 952, Li Tao's brother Li Huan, having befriended Liao's military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Xiao Haizhen (Ëï≠Êµ∑Áúü, a brother-in-law to Emperor Jingzong), persuaded Xiao to consider submitting to Later Zhou. Xiao agreed. Li Huan thereafter wrote Li Tao a letter outlining his plans, pointing out that Emperor Jingzong lacked experience and ambition. Li Huan proposed that the Later Zhou government either immediately attack Liao (upon which Xiao would defect, allowing Later Zhou to obtain Lulong) or seek peace (upon which Liao would agree to a long- term peace treaty). The Later Zhou government, however, was preoccupied and unable to act on Li Huan's proposal. Later (during the reigns of Guo Wei and/or his adoptive son Guo Rong), Li Tao successively served as the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu) and then minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Hubu Shangshu). In 959, when Guo Rong fell seriously ill and was considering naming additional chancellors to assist his young son Guo Zongxun, who would be succeeding him. When he inquired of this matter with the minister of defense Zhang Zhao (), Zhang recommended Li Tao, arguing that both Zhang's request to execute Zhang Yanze and his request to have Yang Bin and Guo Wei relieved of their duties showed foresight proper for a chancellor. However, Guo, despite acknowledging Zhang Zhao's arguments, refused, because he considered Li Tao's disposition to be frivolous and lacking in propriety.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. Upon Guo Rong's death later that year, Li was made the deputy director of the emperor's funereal matters. Guo Zongxun also created Li the Duke of Ju.  During Song  In 960, the major Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin overthrew Later Zhou and took the throne himself, establishing Song dynasty as its Emperor Taizu.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. In the new administration, Li Tao received the title of minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu). He fell ill in 961, when there was an incident that the army commander Yin Xun (), who was assigned to Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, in modern Xuchang, Henan), was commanding a project to sift the Wuzhang Canal (); the conscripted man had a night terror event, and, in the aftermaths, Yin executed more than 10 crew leaders, and captured more than 70 men who fled and cut off their left ears. When a complaint was made to the emperor that this was undue cruel punishment, Li, despite his illness, got up and wrote a petition urging for Yin to be executed to avenge the people. When Li's family members pointed out that he was ill and should rest, he responded, \\"Death happens to everyone, and I cannot be spared of it. I hold the authority over the army; how can I not discuss a matter where an officer killed people unduly?\\" When the emperor received Li's report, he was appreciative of it, but on account of Yin's bravery and past accomplishments, only rebuked him.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Li died shortly after (impliedly, in 961), and was given posthumous honors. (However, the biography of his brother Li Huan indicated that Li Huan died in 962 while still in Liao service and that Li Tao published a collection of Li Huan's writings, appearing to imply that Li Tao died after Li Huan, but not explicitly stating so, although it could also be read as that Li Tao published Li Huan's works sometime before.)

The most commonly encountered trees are California live oak (Quercus agrifolia), California black walnut (Juglans californica) and western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum). At the park's lower elevation, a year-round stream runs along the canyon foothill. The western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Wood duck (Aix sponsa) are restricted in range to this riparian habitat. =Soil characteristics= The soil on the southern slope consists of coarse sand and gravel. The poor water- retaining ability of this soil contributes to the dominance of drought- tolerant scrubs and pyrophyte plants. These xerophytes have shallow but extensive root network to rapidly absorb water from the soil. The soil from the north-facing slope is covered by a thick layer of leaf litter. This organic layer allows water retention by the soil and supports the growth of larger trees species. As the result, oak and other broadleaf outcompete scrubs on the north-facing slope. Activities Over 4 miles (6 km) of trails are available to hikers{http://www.anaheim.net/1096/Oak-Canyon-Nature-Center. Retrieved March 3, 2017 The trails range from flat to moderate incline.

Zumbo (born 1966) is an applied mathematician (psychometrician and mathematical psychologist) working primarily in the psychological, social and health sciences. He is currently Professor and Distinguished University Scholar, the Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Psychometrics and Measurement, and the Paragon UBC Professor of Psychometrics & Measurement at University of British Columbia. He is known for his contributions in the fields of statistics, psychometrics, validity theory, and studies of the mathematical basis of classical test theory and measurement error models. He currently teaches in the graduate Measurement, Evaluation, & Research Methodology Program with additional appointment in the Institute of Applied Mathematics, and earlier also in the Department of Statistics, at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to arriving at UBC in 2000, he held professorships in the Departments of Psychology and of Mathematics at the University of Northern British Columbia (1994-2000), and earlier in the Faculty of Education with adjunct appointment in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Ottawa (1990-1994).  Biography  Bruno Domenico Zumbo was born to Italian parents from Calabria and was raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Zumbo's parents immigrated from Pellaro, Reggio di Calabria to Prince Rupert, British Columbia, then Edmonton, Alberta. Before immigrating to Canada post war, his father and mother carried on a long tradition of olive oil and wine-making, and small-scale terrace farming of grapes, olives, bergamot oranges, and figs in the hillsides of southern Calabria. Although he excelled and competed as an olympic weightlifter, his passions were always mathematics, romance languages (Italian and French), and philosophy. He speaks English and Italian (including the Calabrese dialect), and reads English, Italian and French. He has a twin sister and four other siblings. He completed his B.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB) and his MA and Ph.D. from Carleton University (Ottawa, ON). His studies reflected his curiosity and diverse interests. With an eye to fostering his talents and interests, the University of Alberta allowed him to take graduate (Masters and PhD) courses in statistics and mathematics while eventually completing his B.Sc. in Psychology. Likewise, in graduate school his professors allowed him to pursue and integrate mathematics, philosophy of science and Psychology. His interests continue to be focused on scientific methodology with a blend of mathematics, social sciences like Psychology, philosophy of science and measurement in science. His doctoral dissertation titled \\"Statistical Methods to Overcome Nonindependence of Coupled Data in Significance Testing\\" was under the direction of Prof. Donald W. Zimmerman (Carleton University, Ottawa). Program of research Professor Zumbo is an internationally renowned applied statistician/mathematician, measurement theorist, and research methodologist. His program of research has had wide influence in psychometrics, validity theory, educational and behavioral statistics, and language testing. * Over the last nearly 30 years his interdisciplinary program of research has emerged to have broad interdisciplinary impact and as such is well-recognized in a variety of disciplines including psychometrics and measurement, statistics, language testing, educational research, quality of life and well being, health and human development. * His research has branched to many areas in statistics, measurement, and scientific methodology. He takes a problem-solving point of view to his research in that the research is not tied to any one area of statistics or measurement. His interests in mathematics focused mostly in analysis (e.g., real analysis, measure theory, metric spaces), with some secondary interests in applications of number theory, abstract algebra and linear algebra. He continues to learn and integrate new ideas and areas of mathematics (and philosophy) as necessary to solve a new scientific problem. * As is evident from the list of publications and awards, his program of research is noted for his having addressed cross-disciplinary recurring controversial topics such as theories of measurement validity, measurement invariance, the role of levels (or scales) of measurement in statistics, and the role of hypothesis testing in empirical studies and particularly their lack of robustness to violations of assumptions. His contributions to these debates have highlighted his orientation from the intersection of mathematics, measurement and statistical science with consideration given to philosophy of science and scientific methodology. * His program of research is actively engaged in psychometrics for language testing, quality of life and wellbeing, and health and human development. This applied work, in the end, feeds his basic program of research in research methodology and measurement.

Grubb is an American physician, researcher and scientist, currently a Distinguished University Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Toledo. He is well known for his contributions to the study of syncope and disorders of the autonomic nervous system (in particular Postural Tachycardia Syndrome) (3).  History and Career  Dr. Grubb was born in Baltimore, Maryland on January 21, 1954 and grew up in the then rural Carroll County of Maryland. The son of an electrician, Dr Grubb began working full- time as an electrician and sign maker starting at the age of 14 years and continued to do so until his early twenties. He graduated from South Carroll High School in 1972, and later earned a BA in Biologic Sciences from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 1976. He earned a Medical degree from the Universidad Central del Este in the Dominican Republic in 1980. He then completed a medical residency at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, where he also served as chief medical resident. While doing a rotation in cardiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital he became interested in cardiac electrophysiology after watching some of the first human defibrillator implants. He thereafter completed fellowships in both cardiology and clinical cardiac electrophysiology at the Pennsylvania State University's Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania(4). Grubb then joined the faculty of the Medical College of Ohio (later renamed the University of Toledo Medical Center) as an Assistant Professor of Medicine in 1988 where he initiated the institution's cardiac electrophysiology program. He became an Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics in 1993, and was elevated to a full Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics in 1999. Dr. Grubb is widely known for his research into the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of syncope. He was among the first researchers in the United States to employ head upright tilt table testing for the diagnosis of vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope. He is also widely considered one of the world's leading experts on Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and orthostatic hypotension. Dr. Grubb has also pioneered new wound closure techniques designed to reduce infection rates and enhance wound appearance during permanent pacemaker and implantable defibrillator surgeries. His current focus of research is in exploring the role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of POTS and other autonomic disorders. He has authored over 250 peer reviewed scientific papers and 34 book chapters. He is co-editor of the textbook Syncope: Mechanisms and Management and the author of the book The Fainting Phenomenon. He was a Senior Editor of the journal Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiologyfor 25 years. He is currently the Director of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Program and the Syncope and Autonomic Disorders Clinic at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Toledo, Ohio. Dr. Grubb has also published numerous essays on his experiences as a physician and patient, a collection of which were published as a book entitled The Calling(5). He has also published a number of poems. Dr. Grubb achieved the rank of Eagle in Boy Scouts, and earned varsity athletic letters in both high school and college. He has also received numerous awards throughout his career and received UMBC's Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1994, and was elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) medical honor society in 1997. Dr. Grubb was presented with the Northwest Ohio American Heart Associations' \\"Legacy of Achievement\\" Award in 2001. He was named as a Distinguished University Professor by the University of Toledo in 2009. He was given the Leonard Tow Humanism in Medicine Award in 2006. He received the University's Dean's Award for Career Achievement in 2016 as well as the University's Outstanding Research and Scholarship Award in 2017. Dr. Grubb received Dysautonomia International's \\"Physician of the Year\\" Award in 2015(6,7,8). That same year the British Arrhythmia Alliance named him \\"Medical Professional of the Decade\\"(9). Also in 2015 he was recognized by the Ohio State Senate for outstanding research and clinical practice naming him \\"One of Ohio's finest citizens\\". In 2017 he received the Dion D. Raftopoulos/Sigma Xi Honor Society Award for outstanding original research. In 2018 he was given the University of Toledo's President's Award for Outstanding Contributions in Scholarship and Creative Activity.

It was broadcast from September 2000 to September 2007. Carla Estrada and Reynaldo Lopez participated in the production. The program starred comedians such as: Consuelo Duval, Miguel Galvan, Adrian Uribe, Lorena de la Garza, Gustavo Munguia (since 2001), Reynaldo Rossano (2001 to 2005), Javier Carranza ‚ÄúEl Costeno‚Äù (since 2004), Ariel Manzano (since 2005) and Ricardo Hill (2001 to 2003). At the beginning of its broadcast, it was hosted by Andres Garcia and Jaime Camil. History At the beginning of the series models such as Jazmin, Ivonne and Sabelle participated. In April 2001, Jazmin was replaced by Marian, who remained a model from April 2001 to the last showing in September 2007. Then, in early 2002, the show decided to replace Sabelle with Sabrina. From then on, Ivonne, Marian and Sabrina were the models from 2002 to early 2005, because in early January 2005, Sabrina had to leave the country. For this reason, the show was left with Ivonne and Marian as models from January to May 2005. In June, the show found another model, Paola, to take Sabrina‚Äôs place. Since then, Ivonne, Marian and Paola were the models until the last episode in September 2007. Before the next sketch starts, the models would appear dancing sexy in bikinis or other skimpy outfits (such as angels, policewoman, nurses, cheerleaders etc..) while also revealing cleavage. They would also usually make cameo appearances in sketches, sometimes having lines. When the whole cast went to Acapulco in a couple episodes during season 3, the models appeared on the beach, dancing in full on bikini. Beginning in 2001, the program no longer had a set host, and was replaced by stellar guests in each broadcast, among those include \\"Resortes\\", \\"India Maria\\", Silvia Pinal, Luc√≠a M√©ndez, H√©ctor Su√°rez, Mar√≠a Victoria, Eugenio Derbez, Kuno Becker, among many other great stars of the world of Cinema, Television and Sport. Originally, the show was transmitted by ‚ÄúCanal de las Estrellas‚Äù on Thursdays, taking place of the show ‚ÄúPicard√≠a Mexicana‚Äù as part of Televisa‚Äôs comedy bar. During the time that the show aired, it underwent many schedule changes: Initially, it was broadcast at 10:00 pm., later at 11:00 pm. In 2002, when the comedy bar titled, ‚ÄúNos Vemos a las 10‚Äù, it was once again broadcast at 10:00 pm, being the only show to have remained on the comedy bar from 2002 to 2005. That same year, it began to be airing on Saturdays around 7:00 pm. Finally, in 2007, it was broadcast Friday nights at 8:00 pm. La Hora Pico was formed from a series of sketches and gags from all different kinds of humors: black humor, urban, white, double meanings, and puns. The sketches were specially prepared and according to the characteristics of each of the guests, without ridiculing, offending or mocking his person. Only comical situations were proposed in which the public enjoyed its star in another facet of his career. All these elements resulted in an entertaining and humorous program for the whole family. La Hora Pico addressed issues of universal and topical interest.

The Battle of L√§nkipohja was a Finnish Civil War battle fought in the village of L√§nkipohja (now part of the J√§ms√§ municipality) on 16 March 1918 between the Whites and the Reds. Together with the battles fought in Kuru, Ruovesi and Vilppula between 15 and 18 March, the Battle of L√§nkipohja was one the first military operations related to the Battle of Tampere, which was the decisive battle of the Finnish Civil War. The battle is known for its bloody aftermath as the Whites executed 70‚Äì100 capitulated Reds. One of the executions was photographed and the images have become one of the best known pictures of the Finnish Civil War.  Background  The village of L√§nkipohja is located by the Tampere‚ÄìJyv√§skyl√§ highway, 60 kilometers northeast of Tampere which was the main base for Red Guards on the Tavastia Front. The Reds took control in L√§nkipohja in 10 February. It was one of the northernmost areas occupied by the Reds. Their intention was to proceed to the town of Jyv√§skyl√§ in Central Finland and reach the Haapam√§ki‚ÄìJyv√§skyl√§ and Jyv√§skyl√§‚ÄìPieks√§m√§ki railways. As the Whites launched their offensive against Tampere, L√§nkipohja's location was strategically important as the village closed the way to the town. Preceding clashes occurred in 12 March, as 360 men of the Red Guards from Urjala, J√§ms√§ and H√§meenlinna attacked to the village of Ev√§j√§rvi, 9 kilometres north of L√§nkipohja, but the offense failed. At the same time, a White Guard unit from Kuortane invaded L√§nkipohja from the east. They were pushed back as the Reds returned from Ev√§j√§rvi. Several Reds were killed and the local Red commander Vihtori Hurri was severely wounded, but the Whites had no fatalities.  Battle  As the White Army launched their major offensive against Tampere, their plan was to take L√§nkipohja, then attack Orivesi 25 kilometres west of L√§nkipohja and cut the Tampere‚ÄìHaapam√§ki railway. The White troops were commanded by the colonel K. F. Wilkman. The 2,500-men regiment was divided into three battalions which were led by the major Torsten Aminoff, rittmeister Oskar Wilkman and captain Aarne Heikinheimo. They were supported by an artillery battery commanded by the Swedish volunteer Nils Palme and a reserve battalion under the command of the major Sixten √ñberg. The number of Red Guard fighters in L√§nkipohja is unknown, but most likely there was about 1,000 Reds. The Swedish count Archibald Douglas, who fought for the Whites, estimated about 2,000 fighters. According to the Red commander Vihtori Hurri, a couple of days before the battle the number of Reds was only 552. The Red Guards came from the nearby villages of L√§ngelm√§ki, J√§ms√§ and Orivesi, and from the southern Finland from Urjala, H√§meenlinna, Tuusula, Kerava, M√§nts√§l√§, Espoo and Helsinki. The Helsinki Red Guard had sent its famous A-komppania (the ‚Ä≥A Company‚Ä≥). It was one of the Red elite units, composed of strength sports athletes and gymnasts. The Reds were aware of the oncoming offensive. For example, the newspaper Ty√∂mies wrote a day before how the Whites had gathered their troops in the L√§nkipohja area. In the night before the battle, a large number of civilians fled the village. The Reds had built their main defensive line to the Hirsikangas Hill, two kilometres north of L√§nkipohja. They had brought down a large number of trees, then piled the cut logs on the both sides of the road and soaked them with water. In the below zero temperature, the stacks of wood were now covered by thick ice. The structure extended more than 50 meters on both sides of the road. As the trees in the slopes were cut, the attacking Whites had to cross a wide open ground covered in deep snow. Executed Reds in Vilkkil√§ after the battle. The Whites attacked L√§nkipohja from three directions; rittmeister Wilkman from north, major Aminoff from east and captain Heikinheimo from west. The white offensive was launched at 7 AM with heavy artillery fire. The bombing destroyed several buildings in both L√§nkipohja and the nearby village of Vilkkil√§ where the Heikiheimo battalion was to strike. Most of the Reds remained in the village, the defensive post in the Hirsikangas Hill was occupied with only 80 fighters of the Tuusula and Helsinki Red Guards. The Urjala Red Guard was placed behind them, while the rest were ensuring the eastern and western sides. The Aminoff battalion, which attacked from east, was stopped in a less than an hour as well as the Heikinheimo battalion in Vilkkil√§, two kilometres west of L√§nkipohja. The Wilkman battalion attacking the main defensive line was forced to retreat at 10 AM. With the help of √ñhman reserves, Wilkman soon launched a new offensive and finally reached the Red positions. The battle was now fought with bayonets and knives and the outnumbered Reds were forced to retreat. The wounded Reds remaining in the defensive posts were killed. As the Red defense collapsed, Wilkman was now able to enter L√§nkipohja, only to be hit by their own men as the Aminoff battalion mistook them for Reds. Finally the Whites took the village at 3 PM as the Reds fled south across the frozen lake L√§ngelm√§vesi. After L√§nkipohja was lost, the only remaining Reds were now the 300 fighters of Tuusula Red Guard who were still resisting in Vilkkil√§. The Wilkman battalion attacked from their rear and the battle was over in the late afternoon. Most of the Reds managed to flee, but about 100 surrendered believing that they were treated like prisoners of war. However, all the surrendered Reds were executed. Leander Viljanen, the commander of the Tuusula Red Guard, hid from the Whites and committed suicide the next day. A White firing squad executes Red prisoners (photo taken by Harald Netvig).  Executions and casualties  The executions started immediately as the fighting ceased. They were carried out by the battalions of Oskar Wilkman and Sixten √ñberg. The firing squads were led by the J√§ger officers Bjarne Wegelius and Jarl Wegelius. The number of executed is estimated between 70 and 100, including several local civilians. The number of Reds killed in the battle is estimated 20‚Äì60. The White casualties were 37 men, including two Swedish volunteers.  Natvig photographs  The battle was photographed by the Norwegian Red Cross medic Harald Natvig. His images on the Finnish Civil War are featured in the book Fra den finske frihedskrig 1918: Vestarm√©en, published in late 1918. In L√§nkipohja, Natvig also took a series of three photographs on the execution of 13 surrendered Red Guard fighters, who were found hiding in basement and shot on 17 March. The first image shows the firing squad preparing for the execution, the second shows the Red Guard fighters being hit by bullets, and the last one shows a White officer giving a death blow to a suffering victim. The last two images of the series are some of the best-known images of the Finnish Civil War.  Commemoration  The memorial of the fallen Whites was erected in 1938 by the Hirsikangas Hill. Next to the present-day National road 9 is the memorial of two killed Whites, father Matti Laurila and son Ilmari Laurila. Fallen and executed Reds were buried to a mass grave by the L√§ngelm√§ki Church. The memorial was erected in 1946.

She donated a bucket full of rice to a daily wage- earner who sells idli/dosa (snacks in Indian breakfast) on a bicycle. She posted a photograph of it on her Facebook wall and tagged some of her friends and challenged them to continue it.

He has been a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since 2002, representing the electorate of Unggai-Bena Open, variously as an independent (2002) and for the United Resources Party (2002-2012) and People's National Congress (2012-present). He has been Minister for Lands and Physical Planning in the government of Peter O'Neill since August 2012. Allan previously served as Minister for Environment and Conservation under Michael Somare from 2007 to 2011. Allan was educated at Goroka High School, Lae Technical College and Goroka Teachers College. He was a high school teacher before leaving to work in the private sector, managing liquor distribution company Negiso Distributors. He was elected to the National Parliament as an independent at the 2002 election, after which he joined the United Resources Party. He served in the opposition shadow ministry under Mekere Morauta from February until May 2005 when he crossed over to the government, becoming a parliamentary secretary in June 2005. He was re-elected at the 2007 election as a URP candidate, after which he was appointed Minister for Environment and Conservation by Prime Minister Michael Somare. Allan was an advocate for addressing climate change in this capacity, telling the United States at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference \\"if for some reason you are not willing to lead, leave it to the rest of us and please get out of the way\\". In February 2008, he stated that three foreign firms had attempted to bribe him with free travel in order to fast-track approvals for their investments. In April 2008, he announced that no further exploration licenses along the historically sensitive Kokoda Track would be approved while the Somare government was in power. In April 2009, he proposed a national ban on the use of plastic bags. In April 2010, Allan defended controversial laws which sought to protect development projects from delays caused by environmental challenges by preventing departmental approvals from being challenged in court, which had been criticised by some lawyers and human rights organisations as \\"draconian\\". In May 2011, in his electorate capacity, he advocated for a total ban on liquor sales in the Eastern Highlands Province. In May 2011, he was one of several government ministers to switch to the opposition and bring down the Somare government, resulting in the election of Opposition Leader Peter O'Neill as Prime Minister. Allan was re-elected for the People's National Congress at the 2012 election, having crossed to the new governing party led by O'Neill. He was subsequently appointed Minister for Lands and Physical Planning in O'Neill's post-election reshuffle. He faced significant ongoing concerns in this role around corruption in relation to the distribution of land titles. In October 2012, he moved to have the Lands Department collect more than K94 million (US$45 million) in unpaid state land rents. In March 2013, he announced an investigation into land deals alleged to have been fraudulently acquired across the country. Under Allan, the department subsequently undertook an audit of the extent of land that is under state lease and land under customary tenure in the National Capital District, with the intent to do the same nationally, in order to settle widespread confusion about legal land ownership. In October 2013, he proposed restricting land ownership to Papua New Guineans, with foreign investors to be required to partner with local entrepreneurs. In March 2017, he refused to revoke a subset of leases that had previously been found to be largely fraudulently obtained, and in the face of public controversy resolved to instead convert them to registered land.

She served as an ocean escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. Background The ship was ordered on 19 September 1939 from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The ship's keel was laid on 22 May 1940,Lynch, p. 98 and the ship was launched on 2 September. The ship was commissioned about one month later, on 18 October.Friedman, p. 340 War Service On 21 November 1940, Rhododendron, part of the escort for Convoy OB244, attacked the German U-Boat U-103 with depth charges, helping to drive the submarine away from the convoy. Although U-103 escaped unscathed, this attack led to the incorrect claim that Rhododendron had sunk U-104. That same day, she picked up 36 survivors from the merchant ship Daydawn, which earlier that day had been sunk by U-103. At the beginning of 1941, Rhododendron was part of the 8th Escort Group. On 17 January 1941, she detonated a mine in Liverpool harbor, knocking out her engines and steering gear and causing minor structural damage. Rhododendron was under repair at Liverpool for three months. On 28 July 1941, she picked up 26 survivors from the Lapland, a merchant ship which was torpedoed by U-203. On 1 October 1941, Rhododendron was part of the 36th Escort Group, based at Liverpool. In November 1942, the British and Americans landed in French North Africa in Operation Torch, with Rhododendron helping to escort one of the convoys carrying invasion forces from Britain to the Centre Task Force beaches at Arzew near Oran in Algeria on 9 November. On 4 July 1943, she picked up more than 300 survivors from several merchant ships which were torpedoed by German submarines U-409 and U-375 off of Algeria. Fate She was sold in 1950 to a shipping company, where she was turned into the merchant Maj Finke. She was sold for demolition in South Africa in 1968.

At the time of his retirement from the university in 2008, he was the W. Russell and Eugenia Morcom Chair of Psychology and Education and Director of the Florida Center for Reading Research. Dr. Torgesen received his Ph.D. in Developmental and Clinical Psychology from the University of Michigan in 1976, and served on the Psychology faculty at FSU from 1976 until 2008. Dr. Torgesen's early research focused on memory processes in children with learning disabilities, but most of his career was spent investigating and writing about the language difficulties of children with specific developmental reading disabilities (dyslexia). He is the author or co-author of over 230 books, book chapters, and articles on the psychology of reading, reading disabilities, and reading instruction. He is also the author, with Dr. Richard Wagner and Dr. Carol Rashotte, of two of the most widely used diagnostic tests for dyslexia, The Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processes and the Test of Word Reading Efficiency. In 2002, Dr. Torgesen was asked by Governor Jeb Bush of Florida to establish a center for reading research at Florida State University. The center was to have a four part mission: 1)to conduct basic research on reading and reading instruction; 2) to disseminate information about research-based practices in reading instruction and assessment; 3) to conduct applied research related to policy and practice in literacy instruction in Florida; and 4) to provide technical assistance to Florida's schools and the State Department of Education. Since its establishment in 2002, the Florida Center for Reading Research has grown to become one of the leading research centers in reading in the world, with 9 permanent faculty and over 300 current employees.

She served as the founding and honorary Secretary of the Bird-Ringing Committee in 1937 and continued to work on ringing until 1963. Born in Plymouth, the younger daughter of Sir Edward Pemberton Leach, Elsie grew up in well-connected family that moved across the United Kingdom. From an early age she was introduced into outdoors pursuits, riding, fishing and hunting. An interest in birds was sparked off through her friendship with Emma Louisa Turner which led to a meeting with H. F. Witherby in 1930. At that time Witherby was working on the establishment of a marking scheme for British Birds and she took responsibility for the Ringing Scheme in 1937. Her skills at ringing and care in maintaining records were well known and her memory and ability to recall recoveries helped in her work. She compiled recovery records and produced annual reports from 1938 and went on to produce them until 1951. She retired in 1953 but continued to work on ringing until 1963 when the ringing office shifted to Tring. Her work was recognized by the award of the Bernard Tucker Medal and she was made Member of the Order of the British Empire.

History From 1709 the board of admiralty usually had a minimum of two Civil Lord Commissioners, however, there was not a settled arrangement for the distribution of duties amongst the members of the Board. In 1805 the First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton, the Lord Barham, began a period of reform of the commissioners responsibilities during his tenure. He initially gave a new name to the Naval Lord Commissioners now referred to as \\"Professional Naval Lords\\", whilst the Civil Lords were given the duty of signing off all official documents. In 1830 when Sir James Graham was appointed First Lord he also underwent further re- organising of the board following the abolition of the Navy Board each of the members were given particular responsibility for different areas of naval administration from this year it was fixed in principle that, other than the First Lord, there should be four Naval Lords; and one Civil Lord who was added in 1832. This arrangement was subject to minor variations. In 1834-5 there were three Naval and two Civil Lords. Between 1830 and 1868 he had main responsibility for Naval Finance, this however changed when Parliamentary Secretary was re-designated the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary. In January 1869 the civil lord through an order in Order in Council was designated an assistant to the First Lord of the Admiralty. These orders usually had a much wider remit in that they outlined the general regulations of governance of the Naval Service. In March 1872 another order in council was issued this time the civil lord would have specific duties assigned to them by the First Lord defining on this occasion the structure of the board. In 1874 the civil lord was given much wider powers. Exceptional changes to these rules meant that during wartime periods additional civil lords (though not officially styled so until after 1882) were added to the board to ease the burden of workload on the Civil Lord. The office existed until 1964 when the Admiralty was abolished and replaced by the Navy Department within a new Ministry of Defence. Responsibilities The Civil Lord assisted the First Lord in political and parliamentary duties, between 1830 and 1964 his remit changed from time to time but generally included the following responsibilities: * Deal with all special questions relating to the retirements, pay, and allowances of naval and marine officers and men. * Direct Civil Engineering Works. * Manage all Admiralty buildings including repairs and the construction as well as the storing of building materials that were within the Works Department. * Manage business within the Greenwich Hospital Department. * Manage compassionate allowances, the admiralty charitable fund, the allowances to ministers of religion, the various Dockyard and Marine Schools. * Manage leasing arrangements in regards to coastguard stations. * Superintendence of all Admiralty works and labour services. * Superintend all civilian staff at naval establishments, including: classifications, appointments, promotions, pay, allowances, and pensions, excluding appointments and promotions in London, and of professional officers of the Controller's Department of Dockyards. * Superintends the Contracts Department. * Superintends the Department of the Accountant General of the Navy. (in 1932 this department is abolished its financial functions were merged within the Department of the Permanent Secretary.

Hoeufft made a fortune from his diplomatic and business ventures, ultimately becoming one of the richest men in Europe outside of the royal families. Biography =Early life and career= Jan Hoeufft was born in 1578 in Li√®ge in the Spanish Netherlands to one of the most powerful families of the United Provinces. His father, a Roermond timber merchant, had moved to Aachen, Li√®ge and Heinsberg after converting to the Reformed Church. Not much is known about Jean Hoeufft's early life. He did not marry and had no known children. Hoeufft eventually settled in Rouen, where there was religious freedom for Protestants for a time under Henry IV of France. He was naturalized in 1601. He developed trade and ship owner activities trading between Spain and the United Provinces. From 1609 until 1616, he was deeply involved in the salt trade from Hiers-Brouage, along with his brother Dirck, based in Dordrecht. They supplied ships to the East India Company, and in 1620 they commissioned a ship-of-war, to be built in Amsterdam for Charles, Duke of Guise.Amsterdam City Archives, not. S.

In 1628 he was allowed to collect taxes, and thus became an agent of Richelieu, who used his connections to raise money on the Dutch money market. In the 1630s he became a banker. Hoeufft repeatedly advanced funds to the King, and took part in major financial deals. In 1634 Hoeufft participated in peace talks between the Dutch and Spain, in which Jules Mazarin and Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange were also involved.

Hoeufft, described by a contemporary as ‚Äú‚Äòa man capable of speaking and acting‚Äô as well as ‚Äò[having] money to distribute to people should there be need,‚Äô‚Äù was well-suited to the job. Hoeufft delt with Axel Oxenstierna, Johan Adler Salvius, Hugo Grotius, Abraham de Wicquefort and Adriaen Pauw on the French support for the Swedish army; the money had to be allocated to the Amsterdam Wisselbank. In finance, he was Cardinal Richelieu's banker for remitting subsidies during the Thirty Years War, and as banker to the Dukes of Saxe-Weimar, was charged with building financial links between the courts of France and Weimar. Hoeufft occupied a prominent place in the network of political interests that bound together France‚Äôs structure of alliances during the Thirty Years War. \\"In some sense, his political interests were so tightly interwoven with his financial and mercantile interests that they are difficult to disentangle.\\" =Hydraulic engineering= A footbridge over a canal in the Marais Poitevin The Hoeufft family invested over a million livres in reclamation of lakes and wetlands in Picardie, Poitou and other parts of France. For the most part this work was carried out between 1642 and 1653 by Dutch engineers, such as . In 1650, Hoeufft was the director of the operation to drain the Poitou Marsh in western France. From the 1640s, one of his associates was David de la Croix, who married Hoeufft's niece, Marguerite Hoeufft. When Hoeufft died, de la Croix was among his beneficiaries and took over the Poitou marsh operation. Fr√©d√©ric Otto Fabrice de Gressenich, Councillor and Ma√Ætre d'hotel du Roi, the son of Hoeufft's sister Anne, inherited the Sacy marshes along with his H≈ìufft cousins. As the only cousin living in France, Fabrice administered the lands on their behalf. =Death and legacy= Hoeufft died in Paris on 5 September 1651. He had two brothers and five sisters, who by then lived in Cologne, Dordrecht, London, and Utrecht. Hoeufft bequeathed two million livres to the poor of the Reformed Church of Charenton, near Paris.

He is known for his actions in the Second Opium War. Early life One of the Saumarez naval family originating in Guernsey, he was born on 31 March 1827 at Sutton, Surrey, the son of Richard Saumarez R.N. and Anne Ellson, and a great-nephew of James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez. After education at the Western Grammar School, Brompton, he entered the Royal Navy in 1841. Saumarez as a midshipman served on the east coast of South America, and was promoted lieutenant in March 1848. He served mainly on the west coast of Africa, where on 31 March 1851 he saved a man from drowning and received the Royal Humane Society's silver medal. Later that year he commanded a division of gunboats at Lagos and was severely wounded. The Cormorant and the Forte In September 1854 Saumarez was promoted to commander. In May 1858 he had command of HMS Cormorant, a Vigilant-class gunvessel, and served with at the capture of the Dagu forts, in the Second Opium War. The Cormorant led the attack and broke through a boom. Her first broadside, simultaneously, dismounted the largest of the Chinese guns. He then took part in the operations in the Hai River and in the occupation of Tianjin. At Ningbo he carried out a detailed investigation into the local Christian missionary work. Saumarez was promoted to the rank of captain, on 27 July 1858. He then served as captain of HMS Forte, a steam frigate and flagship to Richard Laird Warren, on the east coast of South America in 1861. A diplomatic incident occurred after Brazilian police arrested officers from the Forte at Tijuca; in a strained atmosphere, it contributed to a breaking-off of diplomatic relations between Brazil and the United Kingdom, and helped end the career of William Dougal Christie. Saumarez and the gunboat HMS Sheldrake were heavily involved in this \\"Christie crisis\\". Later life On 12 April 1870 Saumarez was retired, and he was nominated a C.B. in 1873. He became by seniority a rear-admiral in 1876, vice-admiral in 1881, and admiral in 1886. He resided at 2 Morpeth Mansions, Westminster, and died at Ramsgate on 22 January 1903. Family Saumarez married (1) in 1854 Agnes Jean Block, daughter (d. 1866) of S. R. Block of Greenhill, Barnet; and (2) in 1868, Eleanor, daughter of B. Scott Riley, of Liverpool. He left no issue.

Life Peacock was born on 26 September 1842 in the village of Shakhmanovka, district of Kozlov, in the government of Tambov, Russia; he was the son of Charles Peacock, estate manager, and his wife Concordia n√©e Schlegel. He was educated at a school in England, and afterwards at the University of Moscow. Batumi (1881) by Lev Feliksovich Lagorio On 25 October 1881 he was appointed vice-consul at Batumi, which had become important in consequence of its annexation by Russia. He became consul on 27 January 1890. He is said to have owed his appointments to his familiarity with the Russian language. He was well acquainted with the languages and customs of the inhabitants in the mountains of the Caucasus, among whom he had established such friendly relations that he was admitted into their most remote fastnesses. One of the fruits of these expeditions was the publication of original vocabularies of five west Caucasian languages: Georgian, Mingrelian, and the Laz, Svan, and Apkhaz languages. Up to that time no contribution on these languages had appeared in English. On 14 October 1891 Peacock was appointed consul-general at Odessa, but had only been in residence a few weeks when he died there, on 23 May 1892; it was supposed that he died of Caucasian fever, the marshes which surrounded Batumi rendering the town very unhealthy. He was buried in the British cemetery in Odessa. He left a widow, Tatiana n√©e Bakunin, and three sons and three daughters. Peacock left little by which the world can form a judgment of his abilities. According to the Levantine Herald, as quoted by The Athenaeum, he wrote a book on the Caucasus which was not approved by the Foreign Office; his widow promised to publish it, but it is not known whether it appeared.

This is an aspect of mating. Many animals that live in water use external fertilization, whereas internal fertilization may have developed from a need to maintain gametes in a liquid medium in the Late Ordovician epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as reptiles, some fish, and most birds) occurs via cloacal copulation, known as cloacal kiss (see also hemipenis), while mammals copulate vaginally, and many basal vertebrates reproduce sexually with external fertilization. In spiders and insects Spiders are often confused with insects, but they are not insects; instead, they are arachnids. Spiders have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large pedipalps, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can store sperm indefinitely. For primitive insects, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation. In groups that have reproduction similar to spiders, such as dragonflies, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female. In dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment. In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a spermatophore) into the female's reproductive tract.  In mammals  Sexual behavior can be classified into behavioral states associated with reward motivation (\\"wanting\\"), reward consummation aka pleasure (\\"liking\\"), and satiety (\\"inhibition\\"); these behavioral states are regulated in mammals by reward- based sexual learning, fluctuations in various neurochemicals (i.e., dopamine ‚àí sexual desire aka \\"wanting\\"; norepinephrine ‚àí sexual arousal; oxytocin and melanocortins ‚àí sexual attraction), and gonadal hormone cycles and further influenced by sex pheromones and motor reflexes (i.e., lordosis behaviour) in some mammals. These behavioral states correlate with the phases of the human sexual response cycle: motivation ‚àí excitement; consummation ‚àí plateau and orgasm; satiety ‚àí refraction. Sexual learning (a form of associative learning) occurs when an animal starts to associate bodily features, personality, contextual cues, and other stimuli with genitally-induced sexual pleasure. Once formed, these associations in turn impinge upon both sexual wanting and sexual liking. In most female mammals, the act of copulation is controlled by several innate neurobiological processes, including the motor sexual reflex of lordosis.PFAFF Donald W. , SCHWARTZ-GIBLIN Susan, MACCARTHY Margareth M. , KOW Lee-Ming : Cellular and molecular mechanisms of female reproductive behaviors, in KNOBIL Ernest, NEILL Jimmy D. : The physiology of reproduction, Raven Press, 2nd edition, 1994 In males, the act of copulation is more complex, because some learning is necessary, but the innate processes (retrocontrol of penis intromission in the vagina, rhythmic movement of the pelvis, detection of female pheromones) are specific to copulation. These innate processes direct heterosexual copulation.MEISEL Robert L. , SACHS Benjamin D. : The physiology of male sexual behavior. in KNOBIL Ernest, NEILL Jimmy D. The physiology of reproduction, Raven Press, 2nd edition, 1994 Female lordosis behaviour became secondary in hominidae and is non-functional in humans.Dixson A.F. Primate sexuality: Comparative studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Human Beings. Oxford University Press, 2nd edition, 2012. Mammals usually copulate in a dorso-ventral posture, though there are some primate species that copulate in a ventro-vental posture. Most mammals possess a vomeronasal organ that is involved in pheromone detection, including sex pheromones. Despite the fact that humans do not possess this organ, adult humans appear to be sensitive to certain mammalian pheromones that putative pheromone receptor proteins in the olfactory epithelium are capable of detecting. While sex pheromones clearly play a role in modifying sexual behavior in some mammals, the capacity for general pheromone detection and the involvement of pheromones in regulating human sexual behavior has not yet been determined. The duration of copulation varies significantly between mammal species, and may be correlated with body mass, lasting longer in small mammals than in large mammals.Stallmann, Robert R., and A. H.

He is the minister for Inner City and Zongo Development and the former minister for information.  Early life and education  Mustapha Abdul-Hamid was born in the Northern Regional capital of Tamale on the 14th of June 1971 to Hamidu Yakubu and Adama Musah. Hamidu Yakubu was a soldier with the 6th Battalion of Infantry in Tamale. Adama Musah is a retired teacher who taught in various schools around the Tamale metropolis. He attended the Station Experimental Primary School in Tamale from 1976-1982. He then went to Bawku Secondary School for his Ordinary Level from 1982-1987. Mustapha Abdul-Hamid entered Tamale Secondary School in 1987 for his Advanced level. In 1991, he entered the University of Cape Coast to pursue a Bachelor of Arts course with English Language, Classics and Religious Studies. He eventually majored in Religious Studies, obtaining a Second Class, Upper Division. He also pursued a Diploma in Education concurrently with the Degree program. He obtained an M.Phil in Religious Studies from the University of Cape Coast in 2003. In September 2017, he completed and was awarded a PhD in Religious Studies by the University of Cape Coast. Mustapha Abdul-Hamid‚Äôs research interests are in the area of Islamic Mysticism, Political Thought in Islam, Islam and Gender and Islam in Ghana. He has published extensively in reputable journals around the world. Some of his publications include, ‚ÄúReligious Language and the Charge of Blasphemy: In Defense of Al-Hallaj,‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristian-Muslim Relations in Ghana: A Model for World Dialogue and Peace.‚Äù Mustapha Abdul-Hamid showed an early interest and capacity for debate. In Bawku Secondary School where he had his Ordinary Level education and at Tamale Secondary School where he had his Advance level education, he was a member of the Debating Teams of both schools. Mustapha was such a prolific debater and was feared by any opponents who met the schools that he represented. He is bold and fearless and highly honest and ethical. Indeed, many Ghanaians count him as one of the honest politicians of our time. He is also a faithful adherent of the Islamic religion and prior to being Minister for Inner City and Zongo Development, was already very much involved in Islamic activities in Muslim communities across the country. During his student days at the University of Cape Coast, he was at once the President of the Ghana Muslim Students Association and the Students Representative Council. This is a feat that has not been equaled and may never be equaled. His devotion to Islam is largely fueled by the training that he received in the hands of his father. His father is a very dedicated Muslim. He instilled Islam into the young Mustapha at a very tender age. As early as age 7, Mustapha was a already a muezzin for the neighbourhood mosque where he worshipped with his father. Mustapha‚Äôs parents divorced when he was about four years old. His father took custody of him according to both Islamic and Northern tradition. In Islamic tradition in particular, fathers are required to take custody of their male children in the event of a divorce, if they have attained the age of two. And so his father brought him up in accordance with strict military discipline.  Career and political life  Mustapha Abdul-Hamid has worked in various capacities as a Strategy Planning Manager and Client Service Manager with various Advertising and Marketing Companies such as the Media Majique and Research Systems and Ghana Advertising and Marketing Company. He also worked with and edited newspapers such as the defunct High Street Journal and the Daily Statesman. He was also the News Editor at Choice FM, a radio station based in Accra whose frequency was eventually sold to the Dr. Kwabena Duffuor media group and has now become Kasapa FM. Hamid is the former minister for information. Before his appointment as minister for information in March 2017, he was a lecturer at the Department of Religion and Human Values of the University of Cape Coast. Mustapha Abdul-Hamid‚Äôs career as a politician began in 1991, when he entered the University of Cape Coast. At that time, the military government of the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), headed by Flight Lieutenant (retired) Jerry John Rawlings, had hinted that it was to lift the ban on party political activity in May 1992. Groups which intended to form political parties after the lifting of the ban therefore began to congregate. The group that in Ghana‚Äôs political history had been associated with the Danquah-Dombo-Busia tradition, formed what they called at the time, the Danquah-Busia Club. It was founded in the house of Stephen Krakue at East Legon in Accra. The man who was responsible for planting the club in the Central Region was a senior figure in the tradition called Lawyer Spio. It was he who began the process of recruiting young men and women at the University of Cape Coast to form the nucleus of the club. Mustapha Abdul-Hamid was among the first batch of young men who were recruited to start the party's University of Cape Coast branch.

The first march was held in S√£o Paulo on March 19, 1964, on St Joseph's Day, Saint Joseph being the patron saint of the family, and attracted an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 attendees.  Mobilization  The march was sparked by a speech by then President Jo√£o Goulart in Rio de Janeiro on March 13 in which he called for thing such as political reforms including rent control; wealth tax; expropriation of land within 10 km of roads, railroads and dams, and the nationalization of oil refineries. For years, the mild reforms had been seen by the US government as threatening to its financial interests and hegemony in the region. Goulart had also called for nationalization of foreign mining concerns, such as US-owned Hanna Mining. To discredit Goulart, the US played on exaggerated fears of communism through extensive propaganda supplied via McCarthyist journalists such as Clarence W. Hall and CIA-funded figures such as Father Patrick Peyton, who helped exaggerate the threat of communism. The anticommunist propaganda instilled in Brazilians the specter of an imminent \\"Red\\" takeover during the Cold War while the US government's financial and geopolitical motivations for removing Goulart remained hidden. The media-fed fears prompted Catholic women, especially the group Campanha da Mulher pela Democracia (CAMDE Women's Campaign for Democracy), to organize the march at Pra√ßa da S√©, in S√£o Paulo, and parallel marches elsewhere. The marchers demanded Goulart's impeachment and expressed strong opposition to his reformist agenda. The march was a precursor to the Brazilian coup d'√©tat and prepared the public to accept a coup against Goulart. The US-backed coup installed a military dictatorship that lasted 21 years and arrested, exiled, brutally tortured, and killed thousands. Despite the substantial investment in anticommunist propaganda, no evidence of such a threat ever emerged. The dictatorship left a humiliating, destructive legacy for the nation, which many Brazilians prefer not to remember. Their amnesia was aided by the 1979 Amnesty Law, which granted immunity to the regime's torturers, as well as by calls from former regime officials to \\"turn the page.\\" The amnesia is seen in the occasional parade commemorating the dictatorship, usually by the right-wing military. In 2014, commemorative marches were held in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in support of the 1964 marches, the latter attracting around 150 attendees and around 50 counterdemonstrators.

It consisted of a green ensign with the flag of South Africa (known as the \\"Oranje, Blanje, Blou\\") in canton with a crest consisting of three symbols of the SADF forces inside an outline of the Castle of Good Hope. The flag was adopted in 1981 but was replaced in 1994 following the adoption of a new flag and the reorganization of the armed forces in South Africa as the South African National Defence Force but was still used for a few months after.  History  From 1951, the individual branches of the South African Defence Force had their own flags and ensigns but there was no unified flag to symbolise the whole of the SADF. On 21 March 1981, the Chief of the South African Defence Force approved a design for the forces' unified ensign. The official description of it was \\"A rectangular green flag in the proportion of two to three; within the upper hoist quarter the national flag of South Africa, with a white fimbriation; and in the lower fly quarter the emblem of the South African Defence Force, to wit: On a white ground plan of the Castle of Good Hope, a dark blue erect anchor surmounted by a horizontal pair of steel blue wings and overall, a pair of orange swords in saltire; the whole within a border, the inner half of which is dark green and the outer half gold\\".

In 1994 following the fall of apartheid and election of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, the SADF was reorganised merging them with the African National Congress's Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Pan Africanist Congress's Azanian People's Liberation Army and the Self-Protection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party to create the South African National Defence Force on 27 April 1994. The ensign, following the election of Nelson Mandela in March, initially remained the same with the Oranje, Blanje, Blou in the ensign but was viewed as obsolete. In July 1994, a new ensign was designed which retained much of the original ensign except for substituting the new flag of South Africa in place of the Oranje, Blanje, Blou. The new ensign replaced the old one in its first parade in Pietersburg on 11 November 1994.

The manor was the inspiration for Weatherbury Farm in Thomas Hardy's novel, Far from the Madding Crowd. It is a Grade I listed building. History The house was built in the early 17th century, when the manor was owned by the Earls of Suffolk. In 1641, it was sold to Sir John Strangways. It remained in the possession of the Strangways, who in 1756 became Earls of Ilchester, until 1911 when it was sold to Captain Gerald Carter. The gardens were laid out by Percy Richard Morley Horder when he undertook remodelling of the house in 1911. The house was Hardy's inspiration for Weatherbury Farm in his novel Far From the Madding Crowd. It is now owned by Katharine Butler, who, along with her siblings, was involved in a lengthy court case regarding the Chinese porcelain collection assembled by their father, diplomat Sir Michael Butler. Description The house is of two storeys, with an attic, and is constructed of ashlar and brick. The south front remains predominantly of 17th century construction, while the east front dates from the 19th century rebuilding following the fire. The interiors are almost entirely of the 19th and 20th centuries. The gate piers, the stables, and some of the garden walls have their own Grade II listings.

He was born and raised in Silchar, Assam. He went on to study comparative literature at Jadavpur University. His musical inspiration was his uncle Ananta Bhattacharya. In 1999, he co-founded the band Dohar with the intent to revive the folk music tradition of Northern and Eastern Bengal. He also contributed music to a number of movies. His last movie was Bhuban Majhi (2017). He was associated with the popular Zee Bangla Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, a renowned Bengali music reality show. His last concert was in the Baguihati Krishi Mela. Life and career =Early life= Music was an intrinsic part of Bhattacharya's home at Silchar, Assam. Growing up amidst rhythm & tune, learning to play the tabla happened as naturally as he learned to take his first faltering step. His fascination with the tabla gradually propelled him towards various ethnic percussion. While learning to play this, he also trained in vocal music. His keen interest in music eventually inclined him towards the folk music of Bengal and northeastern India. Thus, began his search for traditional folk songs which are vibrant, melodious and unanimous folk tunes that were always there unnoticed and unidentified. In 1995, he enrolled at Jadavpur University in the Comparative Literature department. In 1998, he got a research grant from India foundation for the arts for Industrial folk music and went to Bangalore. =Dohar= Bhattacharya in one of his folk concerts Bhattacharya formed Dohar, a group of folk musicians, in 1999 to make the unnoticed folk songs flow for time immemorial and reach innumerable people under his creative direction. Dohar's presentation is uniquely original. Their performances amazingly merge the urban feelings with their commitment to the roots; research and entertainment, being inseparably entwined. Dohar has already released nine albums of folk songs directed by Kalika from Concord records, Sony music & Sa re ga ma (HMV). Dohar's fourth album ‚Äì \\"Bangla\\" is a collection of Rabindra Sangeet and folk songs. The concept of the album is a dialogue between Rabindra Sangeet and folk music based on its thematic reading. Dohar was empaneled by Indian Council for cultural relations (ICCR). =Musical career= Bhattacharya sang few playback songs in Hindi and Bengali movies. His songs in Hindi film include Gumshuda, directed by Ashoke Viswanathan. In the year 2007, he sang for the Bengali film Chaturanga directed by Suman Mukhopadhyay. In the year 2008, he sang for the Bengali film Moner Manush (golden peacock award winner) which is an India- Bangladesh joint project directed by Goutam Ghose. It is a feature film based on the novel by Sunil Gangopadhyay on Fakir Lalan Shah's life and philosophy. Bengali film Jaatishwar was a national award (Rajat Kamal) winner directed by Srijit Mukherjee, where Bhattacharya sang in the year 2014. In 2012, Bhattacharya wrote various research oriented articles which were published in various national and international journals and newspapers. He also did music for eminent theater groups like Nandikar, Kalyani Natya Charcha and Tritiyo Sutro. Besides, Bhattacharya was the pivotal personality at a seminar on Dr. Hazarika during that program in Dhaka. Apart from playback in many popular Bengali and Hindi movies, he has given music direction in the films like \\"Selfie\\" directed by Sovan Tarafdar, \\"Bhuban Majhi\\" directed by Fakhrul Arefin (Bangladesh), \\"Bishorjan\\" directed by Koushik Ganguli, \\"Rosogolla\\" directed by Pavel and \\"Sitara\\" directed by Ashish Roy. =Devotion to Folk music= Bhattacharya was fully devoted towards the songs of soul and heart of rural Bengal. This is reiterated from his most recent occupation as one of the founder-organizers of \\"Sahaj Parav\\"- an annual root music festival, one of its kind in India, looking to celebrate the diversity and variety of folk forms of arts and crafts in greater south Asia, with a deliberate focus on Bengal. Through this, Kalika's commitment to the proliferation of the traditional arts is explicit and once again confirms his pledge for the development and rediscovery of the lost tunes of the soil. Kalika also can safely be attributed as a Tagorian scholar. His \\"Ajab Kudrati‚Äü, is also an unparalleled dramatic presentation relating an aspect of Lalan Fakir with Tagore. This proves his unique innovative idea of the dramatic craftsmanship as well. The TV channel Zee Bangla established that Bhattacharya's genius should not only be limited to the Bengalis but should be expanded also to the people cutting across the language barrier just like Punjabi folk songs. He promoted Bengali folk music in the program Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, and got worldwide acclamation. Following the death of Bhupen Hazarika, Bangladesh government organized a memorable program as a token of tribute to the maestro where Bhattacharya led Dohar dishing out unforgettable numbers of Dr. Hazarika. Awards Bhattacharya received the \\"Sangeet Samman award‚Äù from the government of West Bengal for his unique creation and musical excellence in 2013. He received Cultural Ambassador of North East Award From Bytikram Group, Guwahati in 2013.  Death  Bhattacharya died in a road accident near Gurap village in Hooghly district on 7 March 2017, aged 45.

Gabriel Bethlen appointed Sz√©kely as judge of Udvarhelysz√©k and donated Maros√∫jv√°r Castle (today Ocna Mure»ô, Romania) and the surrounding villages to him in 1620. At the age of 25 Sz√©kely married Judit L√≥nyay, on 13 February 1629. His wife was the widow of Andr√°s Ger√©b, the last member of the once-powerful noble house. Through the marriage Sz√©kely received Fi√°tfalva (today part of Cristuru Secuiesc), Szederjes and four other villages (today part of V√¢nƒÉtori) and several other domains in Udvarhelysz√©k, Aranyossz√©k and Torda County. Exile His career and fate took a sharp downturn after the death of Gabriel Bethlen and George I R√°k√≥czi's accession to the Transylvanian throne. The new prince immediately confiscated the Ger√©b heirdom, overriding his predecessor's provision, and also accused Sz√©kely of being part of a conspiracy led by D√°vid Z√≥lyomi against him. As a result Sz√©kely moved to Temesv√°r in early December 1632, leaving behind his pregnant wife. As the son of the late Moses Sr. he became a political trump in the hands of Nikolaus, Count Esterh√°zy, the Palatine of Hungary and the Sublime Porte against George R√°k√≥czi. Meanwhile, Sz√©kely also \\"laid claim to his father's realm\\". According to contemporaries, including Szamosk√∂zy, John Kem√©ny and Georg Krauss, an ahidn√¢me which had been drafted during Prince Moses' rule and contained his still unborn namesake son's appointment as Prince of Transylvania, was in the possession of Sz√©kely. George R√°k√≥czi unsuccessfully asked the Porte to extradite Sz√©kely. In August 1633 the Transylvanian Diet sentenced to death D√°vid Z√≥lyomi and Moses Sz√©kely and confiscated their properties. The prince promised a full amnesty to Sz√©kely when returning home, but he refused the offer. Although Sz√©kely was formally imprisoned at the Yedikule Fortress, he enjoyed a relatively high degree of freedom and was authorized to correspond with domestic supporters, which meant a constant threat to R√°k√≥czi. This manifested in the summer of 1635, when a certain Yusef Agha came with a letter to Transylvania which reflected a possible appointment of Sz√©kely as Prince. Albeit the letter later proved to be a private action by Sz√©kely, this further increased the tension in the domestic politics of Transylvania. With the help of his partisans, Sz√©kely tried to gain support in Moldavia. In response, R√°k√≥czi asked Grand Vizier Tabanƒ±yassƒ± Mehmed Pasha to extradite or assassinate Sz√©kely during a secret correspondence. The Grand Vizier refused his request. By the 1640s, Sz√©kely lost all political influence in Transylvania. His uncle and last domestic supporter Simon P√©chi died in December 1643. In addition, the late Gabriel Bethlen's brother, Stephen became a more significant potential pretender to the Transylvanian throne in the eyes of the Sublime Porte. Sz√©kely was took away from Stamboul and lived in Rhodes since 1646. When George II R√°k√≥czi delayed the payment of regular tax in 1650, the Ottomans threatened to replace him with Sz√©kely. According to historian John Kem√©ny, Moses Sz√©kely died in exile around 1658. As his name as potential pretender did not arise following R√°k√≥czi's disastrous campaign against Poland, it is possible he was already dead by 1657. His only son, Sigismund (Zsigmond) was born in 1633, after his emigration to the Ottoman Empire thus they never met each other.

Today the river is polluted and is channelled to a sewage treatment plant and no longer reaches its natural confluence with the Tiber. Name The Latin name of the Almone, Almo (also the name of its corresponding deity), is derived from the Latin word almus, meaning \\"fertile\\" or \\"nourishing,\\" which may derive from its connection to Cybele, also known as Magna Mater (\\"Great Mother\\"). In modern times the stream has been called Marrana della Caffarella. Marrana (or marana in Roman dialect) is a term that derives from the name of the ancient ager maranus, the fields that surround the Via Appia, and refers to the drainage channels that flow through the countryside near Rome. \\"Caffarella\\" refers to the valley, now a park, that the river runs through. The river has also been known as Acquataccio, a name with two possible derivations. It either refers to the nearby Appian Way, a corruption of Acqua d'Appia (which became d'Accia), or the suffix -accio is to be taken in its pejorative sense, and it refers to the marshy waters of the Caffarella valley. Origin, course, and diversion The Almone originates in the Alban Hills from springs fed by the water of Lake Albano, and runs through the Appian Way Regional Park, fed by the waters of the numerous springs present in the area, including the so-called Acqua Santa (\\"Holy Water\\") of the Fonte Egeria. There, the Via Ostiensis crossed the river with a bridge known as the Travicella. In the second century, the river was used to provide water for the luxurious gardens of the villa called Triopio of Herodes Atticus,L. Quilico, \\"La Valle delle Caffarella e il Triopio di Erode Attico\\", Capitolium 43, 1968. See, for a recent mention of Triopio, Judith DiMaio's description of accessing the Fonte Egera nymphaeum, in Robert Kahn, ed., Rome, pp 226-227. erected on land brought to him by his wife, Aspasia Annia Regilla, and centuries after Rome's fall it was employed for agricultural purposes: to irrigate fields, to water cattle, and to move millstones. The final stretch of the river flowed where the present-day Circonvallazione Ostiense in the Garbatella neighborhood lies. The Almone began to be used for industrial purposes in the early years of the twentieth century, when its waters were diverted to feed a paper mill on the Appian Way, but its decline accelerated in the 1920s, when its final course into the Tiber was covered over to allow the construction of the Rome-Lido railway, and also to provide water to the former thermal power plant on the Via Ostiense. Pollution of the stream has made it such that today, its waters are entirely channeled into the Magliana sewage treatment plant and no longer reach the Tiber at all. It is diverted as soon as it runs under the Via Appia Antica, near Parco Scott, in back of the Piazza dei Navigatori. The closest landmark to the place where it formerly emptied into the Tiber is the large Gazometro. In antiquity The Almone was deeply connected to the arrival of the cult of Cybele to the city of Rome, and played a central role in the city's observance of its rituals. (Andrea Mantegna, Introduction of the Cult of Cybele to Rome, 1505‚Äì1506.) =Cult of Cybele= The Almone's importance in Roman times was linked to the annual festival of the lavatio (ceremonial washing) of the sacred stone of the Phrygian goddess Cybele, which was held on March 27. The sacred black stone, which was identified with the goddess herself, was taken in procession from its temple on the Palatine Hill, through the Porta Capena, and down the Appian Way to the Almone. There it was washed, along with the sacrificial knives pertaining to the deity's cult, at the place where the Almone flowed into the Tiber. The priestly college of the quindecimviri attended the lavatio ceremony, and the return trip was made with great festivity. The choice of the Almone for this ceremony was inspired by events supposedly surrounding the arrival of the cult of Cybele to the city. The sacred stone was brought to Rome in 204 BC, during the Second Punic War, upon the recommendation of the Sibylline Books. While the ship bearing the stone was navigating the Tiber, it became beached near the area where the Almone flowed into the larger river. The ship was able to sail again only after a ritual of purification was completed. The ceremony therefore alluded to, even if it did not reenact, Cybele's original arrival in the city. Based on the discovery of a small tuff basin in the Temple of Magna Mater on the Palatine, some have hypothesized that the ritual bathing of the black stone originally occurred there, and that its annual journey to the Almone was only begun during the reign of Augustus. Whatever the case, there is evidence for some kind of shrine connected to Cybele on the Almone, although it seems to have been closer to the Via Appia than the place where the stream flowed into the Tiber. The lavatio was carried out until AD 389, when pagan rites were abolished in favor of Christianity. =In classical literature= The stream lends its name to one of the heroes in Virgil's Aeneid, the eldest son of Tyrrhus and one of the first casualties of the war between the Trojans and the Latins in Book VII. Cicero, in his treatise De Natura Deorum, names the Almo as one of the local rivers and streams invoked by the Roman augurs.

Frans Hals painted a group portrait for the Voetboogdoelen, known as the Meagre Company. The spot where the Voetboogdoelen once stood is now occupied by the main building of the Amsterdam University Library. The nearby street Voetboogstraat was named in reference to the Voetboogdoelen.  History  The Voetboogdoelen, also called Sint-Jorisdoelen after its patron saint, Saint George, was one of three doelens (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam schutterij (civic guard). The other two shooting ranges were the Handboogdoelen and Kloveniersdoelen, located along the Singel and Kloveniersburgwal canals respectively. The Voetboogdoelen civic guard was armed with crossbows, while the Handboogdoelen civic guard wielded longbows and the Kloveniersdoelen civic guard used an early type of musket, the arquebus. The Voetboogdoelen was established in 1458 as the shooting range for the voetboogschutterij (crossbowmen's civic guard), and the associated building was completed in the early 16th century. The shooting range extended from the Singel canal to the back side of the houses on Kalverstraat and Heiligeweg.H. de la Fontaine Verwey, \\"Herinneringen van een bibliothecaris'\\", De boekenwereld, Jaargang 3.

Around 1580, at the behest of William of Orange, these Medieval guilds were incorporated into a new, much larger civic guard to defend the newly Protestant city against the Spanish during the Dutch revolt which ultimately led to a full-blown war of independence, the Eighty Years' War. Officers of this new civic guard were recruited from the well-to-do of Amsterdam.\\"The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw, Cornelis Ketel, 1588\\", Rijksmuseum (archived) In the mid-17th century, the Eighty Years' War ended and the civic guard no longer served a military purpose. The civic guard continued to exist, but membership became an honorary position and the doelens assumed a primarily social function. The wealthiest and most powerful citizens of Dutch Golden Age Amsterdam came together in the doelens to eat, drink and smoke. In 1650 the city gave permission for houses to be built on the former shooting ranges of the Voet- and Handboogdoelen. For these houses, two new streets were constructed: the Voetboogstraat and Handboogstraat. Banquets were held in the Voetboogdoelen in 1653 and 1654 to celebrate the founding of the Amsterdam artists' guild, the Guild of Saint Luke. At the first of these feasts, on 20 October 1653, Joost van den Vondel was crowned with a laurel wreath to celebrate his career as a poet.Schilder Cornelis Bris√© - Onderzoek - Coret Genealogie (Dutch, archived) From 1674, the Voetboogdoelen was rented out to the new Dutch West India Company ‚Äî founded after the original company went bankrupt ‚Äî to serve as its headquarters. From then on, the building was known as the West-Indisch Binnenhuis (Inner West India House) or simply West-Indisch Huis (West India House). The building was also used by the Society of Suriname from its founding in 1683 until the company was nationalized in 1795. During the French period, the Voetboogdoelen served as barracks. In 1816 the building was demolished to make way for the Roman Catholic St. Catherine's Church, consecrated in 1820. In 1939, the church was itself demolished.Ger van Dijk, \\"De verdwenen Sint Catharinakerk op het Singel te Amsterdam\\" (Dutch, archived)\\"Catharinakerk\\", Stadsarchief, Gemeente Amsterdam (Dutch) This left the grounds unoccupied until the 1960s, when the main building of the Amsterdam University Library was built on the spot.

The building is regarded as one of the oldest and most notable buildings still standing in the area of Jesmond. The building is located on Clayton Road in Jesmond and was commissioned in 1864 by James Stoddard. Construction of Fernwood House was completed in February 1865. Shortly after its completion, it was sold to tea dealer, William Stewart. Stewart served as the Sheriff of Newcastle between 1876 and 1877, while living in the house. Baronet Walter Runciman and his wife Lady Anne Margaret Runciman bought Fernwood House in 1893, where Runciman served as MP for Hartlepool. He was also owner of one of the largest shipbuilding firms in the area, which spun out to create a number of shipping companies, including Anchor Line. It served as a private maternity hospital between the 1930s and 1960s. In the 1960s, it was purchased by Newcastle City Council and was used as a Children's home in 1966 till 1991. and reception centre until 1991. In 1992, the property again entered private ownership when it was purchased by Greggs and used as their head office. Fernwood House was then sold to Lowes Financial Management in 2016, who are part of the Lowes Group. History =Land ownership (1700s-1863)= The history of the building dates back to when Jesmond was a township in the 1800s. It also had Jesmond Colliery nearby, but was fields and woodland until the land was developed and properties were built in the 1850s. The land on which it was built, was formerly owned by the Warwick family, who also owned Warwick Hall.South Jesmond Conservation Area Character Statement, March, 2007, p.9, An Account of Jesmond The land was sold to the Archbold family in 1821, following the bankruptcy of Robert Warwick, the owner of the Warwick estate. The sale to the Archbold family came as the Warwick estate was broken up and sold off to different buyers. A number of Archbolds owned the land, before James Archbold Pears began to develop the land. Pears was the son of the noble family who owned Fenham Hall near Newcastle Upon Tyne at the time. =Construction and early residents (1864-1937)= After James Archbold Pears inherited the estate, he disposed of some of the land so that it could be developed. This included the land where Fernwood House is now situated. The construction of the building took place in 1864, when a number of properties and roads were established in the area. This included the development of Clayton Road, which the house and many similar style Victorian buildings are now situated in Jesmond, Newcastle Upon Tyne. The house was built by James Stoddard, after he acquired the land. Stoddard worked in London as the owner of the James Stoddard & Company and also the Imperial Chinese Tea company. After the property had been completed, it was sold to the tea dealer William Stewart, who was originally from Newcastle. He and his family resided in Fernwood House from 1865 until 1893. Stewart purchased the property for ¬£1,200, with the aid of a 94% mortgage from Newcastle Permanent Building Society. In 1876 while living at Fernwood House, Stewart became the Sheriff of Newcastle between 1876 and 1877. Once he had finished serving as Sheriff, Stewart substantially extended the property in 1877. The building's significance locally, led it to be referenced in an article by Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, part of his Preachers of Thirty Years Ago series. The article refers to the viewing of the Leonids Meteor Shower that took place in 1866. The ownership of Fernwood House changed again in 1893 after the death of William Stewart. Stewart's widow and son sold Fernwood House to Baronet Walter Runciman and his wife Lady Anne Margaret Runciman. He was the owner of the South Shieds Shipping Company, which later became Moor Line and Anchor Line. Runciman was the second largest ship builder in Newcastle at the time, second to James Knott‚Äôs Prince Line. He served as Liberal MP for Hartlepool from 1914 to 1918. Walter Runciman died in 1937 at Fernwood House, with the estate valued at ¬£286,431. =Maternity Hospital and Newcastle City Council (1937-1991)= Following the death of Walter Runciman in 1937, Fernwood House was then transformed into a maternity hospital. Dr. Henry Harvey Evers, was the doctor who purchased the building in order to turn it into a leading private maternity hospital in the North East of England. Evers subsequently purchased the neighbouring Oakwood House, which he used as his personal residence. During this period, Fernwood House was more commonly known as Fernwood House Maternity Hospital. While it remained as a private hospital throughout, many complicated births were treated in the hospital for people in the surrounding area. In 1945, George Orwell‚Äôs wife Eileen Blair, was admitted to the Fernwood House Maternity Hospital and underwent a hysterectomy whilst her husband George was in Paris reporting on the closing states of World War II. Eileen Blair died while under general anesthetic in the hospital. She was buried in nearby Jesmond Cemetery. Other notable births at the hospital included the founder of Greggs, John Gregg and also two senior figures of Lowes Financial Management. In 1964, the maternity hospital closed its doors and was sold to Newcastle City Council. Fernwood House was again renamed Fernwood House Reception Centre and would act as a replacement for the facility in the centre of Newcastle. The building went under an extensive refurbishment between 1964 and 1966 and reopened in May 1966. A number of distressed children passed through the facility in the 25 years it was open. The most notable was Mary Bell, who was a resident at the property in December 1968, while she underwent an 11-day trial, which saw her convicted of the manslaughter of two young boys. The Fernwood House Reception Centre closed in 1991. =Corporate ownership (1992-present)= Following the closure of Fernwood House as a reception centre, it was purchased by Greggs and used as their headquarters. The building was extensively altered to create a main entrance directly off Clayton Road, while also expanding the car park and landscaping the gardens. Prior to this change, the main entrance was located on the building close to Oakwood House and Denewood House. Several expansions took place in 1997, 2002 and in 2004. The expansions focused on the rear of the property, incorporating a stableman's cottage and taking down several outhouses. Many of the smaller buildings had stood since the early 20th century. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  alt=Addition of a Porch Fernwood House by Greggs (1992)  alt=The addition of a Conservatory East Wing by Greggs (1997)  alt=The extension of a new office area West Wing by Greggs (completed 2002) } Lowes Group Plc. acquired the premises in May 2016 and it became the head office of Lowes Financial Management Ltd.

The company is a joint subsidiary of SNCF and Deutsche Bahn with headquarters in Strasbourg. Rhealys is a consortium of Deutsche Bahn (DB), French (SNCF), Luxembourg (CFL) and Swiss (SBB) railways preparing high-speed railways between Paris, Luxembourg, Switzerland and south west of Germany. The registered office is at Luxembourg. The name Rhealys is a portmanteau of Rhine, Alsace and Lys, because the route traveled Rhine-Alsace- France, the last being symbolized by the Fleur-de-Lys. Although Rhealys prepared the connections listed below, the international train connections between France and Germany are operated since mid-2007 by the newly founded German-French company Alleo. The connections between France and Switzerland are operated by the company Lyria. History On May 23, 2005, the then CEOs of DB and SNCF, Hartmut Mehdorn and Louis Gallois, signed a letter of intent to offer common high speed services between southern Germany and Paris from 2007 onwards.DB und SNCF gr√ºnden gemeinsame Betriebsgesellschaft f√ºr die POS- Strecke. In: Eisenbahn-Revue International, Heft 7/2005, , S. 317. The joint venture agreement was signed by Mehdorn and Anne-Marie Idrac, the former CEO of SNCF, on 25 May 2007 in Paris. Tasks are taken over by the project company Rhealys. Seat of the enterprise was until 2016 Saarbr√ºcken. In total, only seven employees are employed. The joint venture was contractually secured until 2012. However, unlike similar business models such as Lyria between SNCF and SBB, Alleo is not externally communicated and has not been introduced as a trademark. Since the summer of 2008, ICE units have repeatedly failed on the north-east, so that substitute TGVs were used, the connection was frequently broken in Saarbr√ºcken or trains failed completely. In addition to the disturbances and failures, rail traffic on this axis is considered to be less competitive than other modes of transport because of travel time. In March 2008 Hoffmann announced the positive development of the first financial year, in the future, new stops (such as the station Gare de Champagne-Ardenne TGV) and destinations (such as the Marne la Vall√©e-Chessy station, which connects the Disneyland Resort Paris to the French high-speed network) to want. However, with the timetable change in December 2009, the stops of trains to and from Frankfurt at the Lorraine TGV station were cancelled. Since 23 March 2012, the cooperation of the two railways on the new route from Frankfurt am Main via Strasbourg and Lyon to Marseille on the opened in December 2011 LGV Rhin-Rh√¥ne continued. In 2013, a market share of 58% was achieved on the Stuttgart-Paris route. On the Frankfurt-Paris route, the market share of rail is 26% compared to the aircraft. On July 23, 2015, the cooperation in German- French high-speed traffic was extended by five years until 2020. The trains of the 407 series, launched in mid-2015 in German-French high-speed traffic, have meanwhile replaced the series 406 trains eligible for franking, which were dismantled and thus lost their license for traffic to France. From April 2016, the ICE offer should be expanded from five to six trains per day. Of these, four were to travel via Saarbr√ºcken and two via Strasbourg. Between 2007 and 2016, the range of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped from over 60 to around 25 flights per week. With the commissioning of the 106 km long and 320 km / h passable new construction section between Baudrecourt and Strasbourg, the travel time should first be reduced from July 3 by ten minutes to three and a half hours, and the offer be extended from four to five train pairs. Later, another shortening is done at 3 hours and 10 minutes. In 2016, the headquarters were moved from Saarbr√ºcken to Strasbourg.

From December 2007, the operation with five train pairs daily was fully recorded throughout the route. Modified ICE-3 trains and the French TGV POS, which has been tested on German routes since November 2005, are used for international traffic. On the German side the trains stop in Mannheim, Kaiserslautern and Saarbr√ºcken. The maximum operating speeds in France are 320 km/h, between Mannheim and Saarbr√ºcken only 160 km/h. One of the reasons is the lack of the safety system (LZB) required for faster driving in Germany on this upgraded route; In view of the ETCS system under development, the Federal Minister of Transport has banned retrofitting the route with LZB. There are also railroad crossings to be removed, especially between Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe and Kaiserslautern. The track allows in places only a maximum speed of 80 km/h because of the many curves. At the same time, traffic on the Stuttgart - Paris route was recorded with four daily pairs of trains. From December 2007, a train pair was tied to Munich. Only the TGV POS was used there.

Life He was the seventh child and fifth son of George, Duke of Saxony and Barbara Jagiellon, and grandson of Casimir IV Jagiellon. Mentally handicapped, he was the second of only four of their ten children to survive to adulthood and, on the death of his elder brother John in 1537, succeeded him as hereditary prince of the Duchy of Saxony. In Dresden on 27 January 1539, he married the Catholic Elisabeth (ca. 1516‚Äì1541), daughter of Ernest II, Count of Mansfeld-Vorderort and sister of Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort. However, he died four weeks later and the marriage was childless. On the day as his death, Frederick's father released him from his obligation to do homage: George had hoped that \\"his obedient son [ie Frederick] would leave behind him so many seeds that his [ie George's] lands might have a ruling lord\\". Guido G√∂rres, Georg Maria von Jochner, George Phillips (ed.s): Historisch-politische Bl√§tter f√ºr das katholische Deutschland, Volume 46, S. 587 Frederick was buried in the chapel at Meissen Cathedral. George promoted the marriage of Frederick's widow, Elisabeth, to Maurice, Elector of Saxony, son of George's younger brother, the Lutheran Henry the Pious. Henry vetoed the idea and, soon afterwards, inherited the Duchy of Saxony from George when the latter died without surviving male issue in April 1539, less than two months after Frederick. The Duchy thus passed out of Catholic hands.

On November 24, 2014, following the decision of a Grand Jury in St. Louis to not charge Darren Wilson in the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown, protests and rioting broke out in Oakland and later spread to other Bay Area cities. For more than two weeks, the Bay Area was the site of civil unrest as protesters clashed with police and damaged public and private property. Timeline of riots *November 24: In Ferguson, Missouri, a Grand Jury decided not to charge officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed young African-American man. The decision sparked outrage in Ferguson, and rioting rocked the city throughout the night as stores were looted, and cars and buildings were set on fire. In Oakland, hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown to march for Michael Brown. The protesters eventually blocked Interstate 580. The crowd marched back downtown, and as the night wore on became violent. Several stores, and a police car were vandalized, and burning barricades were erected on city streets. Later that night, some stores were looted including a Smart and Finals grocery store. *November 25: Protesters returned to the streets of Oakland the following night, blocking various roads, looting businesses and setting up burning barricades again. 92 individuals were arrested that night. *November 28: Protesters numbering over 1000 gathered in Union Square in San Francisco on Black Friday to continue protesting the Ferguson decision. While originally peaceful, the protests turned ugly as demonstrators hurled objects at police, smashed windows, and attempted to set a news van on fire in downtown. more than 50 people were arrested and two officers suffered injuries from flying objects. Due to violence, BART shut down transportation between the 16th street and 24th street stations, and protests continued until around 10:00 PM. *December 3: A Grand Jury in New York declined to indict officers in the death of Eric Garner. In San Francisco, demonstrators closed off streets in downtown. In nearby Oakland, a peaceful march was held against the New York decision. *December 6: Protests continued in Oakland, now reignited by the decision in the Eric Garner case. A march in Berkeley turned violent as masked protesters clashed with police and shattered windows. Police issued numerous warnings to disperse before using tear gas and rubber bullets on the demonstrators, and clashes continued until 3:00 in the morning *December 7: Protesters gathered in Berkeley again, and marched toward North Oakland, and were confronted by police in riot gear. Tear gas and rubber bullets were once again used and the protesters returned to downtown Berkeley, which was the site of rioting, vandalism, and looting. Numerous buildings including Berkeley City Hall, a McDonald's, Citibank, and a Walgreens suffered damage to windows, and numerous fires were set in the street. *December 8: Demonstrators blocked Interstate 80 in Berkeley for hours, eventually clashing with police, throwing rocks and bottles before being pushed out. *December 9: Protesters marched again through Berkeley, and clashed with police in riot gear, while also setting fires and looting a Pak and Save Grocery store, CVS and 7-Eleven. *December 10: Two undercover CHP officers were discovered in a protest in Oakland and assaulted, with the one officer sustaining a blow to the head. His partner was forced to pull his service pistol while the injured officer arrested his assailant. *December 15: Peaceful protesters blockaded Oakland Police Department headquarters for more than four hours, representing the four hours Michael Brown lay dead in the street, but unlike previous protests there was no property destruction or clashes. Reactions Reactions to the protests were mixed. Some in the public supported the protests while still condemning the violence. However, others were more angry over the destruction. Storeowner Edwin Cabrillo scuffled with protesters using a broom as he tried to protect his wine store from being vandalized. \\"I put my whole life into this shop,\\" he said. \\"This is what makes Oakland worse.\\".

Unnikrishnan and produced by Rockline Venkatesh.VILLAIN  British Board of Film Classification. Bbfc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2017-12-26] It stars Mohanlal, Vishal, Hansika Motwani, Manju Warrier, Raashi Khanna, and Srikanth. The film marks the debuts of Vishal, Khanna, Motwani, and Srikanth in Malayalam cinema. Manoj Paramahamsa and N. K. Ekambaram were the cinematographers. The songs were written by 4 Musics and the film score was composed by Sushin Shyam. In the film's plot, ADGP Mathew Manjooran (Mohanlal) renounces his office after taking a sabbatical but is re-enlisted to deal with one last case involving a series of connected murders. Principal photography began on 3 March 2017 in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, and ended in mid-June. Villain is the first Indian film to be completely filmed in 8K resolution. It was released in India on 27 October 2017 and internationally on 2 November, debuting in the United Arab Emirates. Plot The film opens with the murder of three men who are killed by drug injection at gunpoint. ADGP Mathew Manjooran (Mohanlal) is retiring after a sabbatical; on his last day at work, he is called on by the DGP (Siddique) to investigate the case. Mathew takes the case; he is aided by officers Harshitha Chopra (Raashi Khanna) and DYSP Iqbal (Chemban Vinod Jose). Harshitha says that she saw a woman wearing a burqa rushing into a restaurant on the night of the murder; she offered help, but the woman refused and ran away. Seven months before the murders, Mathew arrests drug lord Felix D. Vincent (Srikanth), who escapes from custody. Mathew and his wife Neelima (Manju Warrier) accompany their daughter (Athira Patel) to her new college in Delhi. While en route, he receives duty call and returns to work, leaving his family to continue their journey alone. Their car is hit by a lorry, leaving his daughter dead and Neelima comatose. In the present, three more men are murdered in the same fashion; the victims have a connection with Tharakan's Hospital. Mathew deduces the killer to be Shaktivel Palanisamy (Vishal), a doctor who works at the hospital. Shaktivel has a dark past. His father committed suicide, and witnessing the death causes Shaktivel mental trauma; he sees incidents of malpractice in the hospital, and after graduating, he starts killing the perpetrators, with his girlfriend Dr. Shreya (Hansika Motwani) as an accomplice (the woman in the burqa). Meanwhile, Harshitha finds out that Mathew's family was murdered by Felix. She informs Mathew, who already knows this and shows no interest. They receive a video message from Shreya, revealing Felix's location. Mathew fights Felix and is about to kill him but draws back, realizing that this is what Shaktivel wants, and instead arrests him. Mathew discovers that Shaktivel's next target is the DGP, who is threatening patient Khalid Musthafa (Kozhikode Narayanan Nair), who died in the hospital. Mathew is sedated, and Shreya takes him to Shaktivel, who plans to kill the DGP in front of him. Mathew tries to dissuade Shaktivel, who believes that the legal system is corrupt and that what he does is alternative justice. He reveals that Mathew mercy-killed Neelima. They argue and engage in hand-to-hand combat; Mathew defeats Shaktivel and spares him because he believes that Shaktivel could still become a good doctor after treating his mental illness. Mathew is then seen building a school, completing Neelima's last wish.

Thomas, a police officer (Cameo appearance) Production =Development= Following the release of Mr. Fraud (2014) starring Mohanlal, B. Unnikrishnan announced in May 2014 that his next film will also have Mohanlal in the lead role. Unnikrishnan's initial plan was to make a sequel to his 2012 film Grandmaster starring Mohanlal, but this was cancelled due to difficulty in obtaining rights from UTV Motion Pictures; its parent The Walt Disney Company had ordered the closure of its Indian productions. In 2016, he planned a project with Mohanlal and Prithviraj Sukumaran, which did not materialise. Unnikrishnan abandoned five projects before choosing his self-written project Villain. In July 2016, he said the film would be a thriller with an ensemble cast and that filming would commence in three months. In September 2016, Unnikrishnan said the project was experiencing some technical problems. During the initial discussions, the film was set against the backdrop of a village, which was later tweaked. He completed the screenplay in two-and-a-half years and estimated a high production cost. In early December 2016, he announced the project was scheduled to begin filming on 20 January 2017 for a release that May; the film would be distributed by Maxlab Cinemas and Entertainments. Initially, Aashirvad Cinemas and HG Entertainment were signed to jointly produce the film; they conducted a preliminary pooja function on 14 December and a few scenes were filmed. Regular filming was scheduled to begin in January as planned. Filming was later rescheduled to commence in March for a July release. Pre-production work was still underway in January 2017. The same month, it was announced that Rockline Venkatesh would produce the film under the Rockline Entertainments company, marking their maiden production in Malayalam. Mohanlal announced the film's title on 7 March 2017. According to Unnikrishnan, it is an \\"investigative thriller\\". = Filming = The film's pooja function was held at the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, on 2 March 2017. Principal photography commenced the following day in Kuravankonam, Thiruvananthapuram, beginning with shots featuring Khanna. Filming took place at Merryland Studio and around Chala marketplace. An investigation office set was created at Merryland Studio. The film's art director was Gokuldas. Mohanlal joined on 5 March. Filming underwent at various places in and around Thiruvananthapuram during early March 2017. The schedule was expected to conclude by 20 March, after which the location would be shifted to Ernakulam. First schedule concluded on 19 March and second schedule began in Kochi on 24 March. Srikanth joined towards the end of this month. During the filming in the first week of April, Mohanlal was spotted with a different look. It was reported to be for some flashback scenes. Warrier joined the filming on 14 April. The second schedule was concluded in Vagamon on 18 April 2017. Post-production began before the final schedule commenced. After a month-long break, the final schedule began in June 2017 in Ernakulam. Vishal and Motwani joined in the first week. Some hospital scenes featuring Vishal were filmed in Edappally. For the filming of a song sequence including Vishal and Motwani, a set was constructed in Ernakulam. Vishal spent 20 days filming for the project. On 10 June, the team returned to Vagamon to film portions of the climax; Mohanlal joined for a 10-day schedule. Filming concluded on 19 June 2017 in Vagamon. The complete filming process was initially planned to take 50 ‚Äì 55 shooting days. The film's editor was Shameer Mohammed, who used a technique known as spot editing (editing on location). Villain is the first Malayalam film to have colour grading done live on location during the filming process. Visual effects (VFX) were used in 47 minutes of footage, which according to Unnikrishnan is unrecognisable because it was used in the background of some natural scenes. A Poland-based company was in charge with the film's visual effects department. Stunt coordinators were Ravi Varma, Ram Laxman and Action G. Manoj Paramahamsa and N. K. Ekambaram were the cinematographers. Villain is the first Indian film to be filmed entirely in 8K resolution; Red's Weapon Helium 8K S35 camera was used in the film. , no theatres in Kerala are equipped with 8K projection and only a few even have 4K. Unnikrishnan said most Indian films are filmed in 1.8K resolution and are upscaled to 2K or 4K for theatre screening, which results in a loss of quality. Unnikrishnan chose to use a Zeiss Otus lens that was designed for use in still cameras. Before filming began, he and cinematographer Manoj Paramahamsa conducted test shoots; his inference was that Otus lenses, having high sensitivity and sharpness, will multiply the workload of a focus puller but will compensate with a greater output. Low lighting was extensively used in the film, which has have no static shots. =Themes= According to Unnikrishnan in Malayala Manorama, Villain is \\"a compelling story of crime and detection\\" that \\"has predominant elements of politics and philosophy woven into it\\" and \\"is more intense than all my previous [films]\\".Truly international ‚Äì that‚Äôs all I can say of Mohanlal: B.

Rating it 3 stars out of 5, Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India said: \\"Mohanlal as the veteran cop, who has endured pain but masks it, showcases his finesse as an actor. One of the strengths of the film is that it doesn't bank on his superstar image and rather focuses on the narrative, which at times is choppy at best ... BGM [film score] by Sushin Shyam adds to the tense scenes and the action sequences too are choreographed well\\". Prem Udayabhanu from Malayala Manorama rated 3 stars out of 5, writing, \\"Only Mohanlal can enact the lingering pain of a personal tragedy with such subdued finesse ... the cop doesn't falter in his clinical observations to join the dots, but that is not the case with the narrative of Villain. Perhaps the emphasis of the filmmakers was on its treatment and on that count it is a justified attempt.\\" Awarding 3 on a scale of 5, Meera Suresh from The New Indian Express wrote: \\"Many might criticise Villain for its slow pace, which is disappointing for a cop story. But, then, when a movie deals with 'grey areas' of life, it is not easy to be taut and steady ... Mohanlal's latest may not be a thrilling edge-of-the-seat outing, but it takes a different route, one that is enjoyable.\\" Calling Mohanlal's performance \\"brilliant\\", she added that his \\"subdued performance lifts the character to another level\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South called it \\"Yet another thriller that mistakes surface coolth for depth\\" Indo-Asian News Service critic awarded 3 out of 5 stars and commented: \\"Villain works fine as long as it doesn't begin to lean on Hollywood prototypes. The indigenous strain is well woven into the thriller ... the director never lets his characters lose track of their place in the jigsaw\\". The review also said the film is \\"very handsomely mounted and shot\\" and \\"builds on Mohanlal's power to express rage and grief without letting go\\", and praised Vishal's performance. Manoj Kumar R. of The Indian Express rated it 2.5 stars out of 5 and commented that the film \\"has some well written and well-shot scenes that establish the mood of the character. Mohanlal is convincing as a dejected copy, who is stuck in the past and looking for a reason to continue living ... the screenplay is intriguing and sets in an element of suspense\\". He also praised Vishal's performance. Directors N. Lingusamy, Mysskin, Pandiraj, Thiru and Suseenthiran were all positive about the film, particularly praising the actors' performances and its making. S. R. Praveen wrote in The Hindu: \\"B. Unnikrishnan's attempt here was not to deliver a straight, taut thriller, but to build a slow-burner, with an emotional family drama and the unravelling of a psycho killer all weaved together. But it is too much load to carry for a script that is short on imagination\\". Rating the film 2 stars out of 5, Priyanka Sundar of Hindustan Times said the film's \\"slow pace, heavy dialogues and disconnected character arc take the thrill out of this investigative thriller\\", and also criticised the script.

He was born the son of an American surveyor in Christchurch, New Zealand and educated at Christchurch Boys' High School. Between 1931 and 1935 he studied chemistry and physics at Canterbury University College and was awarded a B.Sc and M.Sc. In 1935 he sailed to England with an Exhibition Scholarship to take up a fellowship at Oxford University, where he worked under Professor Cyril Hinshelwood at Trinity College. In 1938 he took a post to teach physics at Repton School, but when war broke out he joined the Armament Research Department at Woolwich Arsenal as a Scientific Officer. There he worked on problems related to ammunition, some of which involved the use of high-speed photography. He was later transferred to Fort Halstead in Kent to work in the Theoretical Physics Division on the analysis of shockwaves. At the end of war in 1945 he moved to Bristol to work at the H.H. Wills Physical Laboratory of the University of Bristol. After a period studying deposited metal surfaces, he took the opportunity in 1948 to undertake a Kodak sponsored investigation into the behaviour of thin-sheet crystals of silver halides, a field of research that would dominate the rest of his career. In 1956 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for \\"his work on the borderline between physics and chemistry about the adsorption of gases on surfaces, on catalysis and on the processes occurring in photographic emulsions. With the latter end in view he has investigated in some detail the properties of silver halide crystals; he was the first to demonstrate networks of dislocations in a transparent crystal by making silver precipitate along them so that they become visible under the microscope. He has also shown by careful experimental work the role of the dislocations in providing sensitivity centres and their relation to such sensitisers as silver bromide. He has shown why the grains of the emulsions grow in a plate-like form with the octahedral faces exposed, and demonstrated the presence in such crystals of three dislocations meeting in a point, which determines the crystal form.\\" In 1959 he took up the offer of a professorship at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where he continued his studies of crystal dislocations until his retirement as Professor in 1979 and as Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow in 1995. His tenure as Professor was broken in 1963 when he briefly returned to the UK to take up a position as Director of the National Chemical Laboratory, only for the NCL to be closed down the following year. He died in 2007. He had married three times but had no children. Honours and awards *1955 Awarded C.V.

Early life and education Born to Henry Edward Brooke, a clergyman, Margaret Brooke was educated at home until the age of nineteen. In 1882 she became one of the first five students at the new Westfield College, a higher education college for women, affiliated to the University of London. In 1884 she passed the University of London matriculation examination, but left in 1886 without gaining her degree.'The First Five Students at Westfield', Queen Mary University Library website While at college, Margaret became emotionally involved with Westfield's principal, Constance Maynard. This relationship has been characterised as a college or school 'rave' - a form of infatuation for another student or teacher - common in this period, however, it was probably more serious than this, as Margaret referred to Maynard as her 'wife'. Scholars have accused Maynard of abusing her power in creating this relationship; Maynard's biographer claims that Margaret Brooke was heart- broken by the end of the relationship ended. Missionary work On leaving college in 1886, Margaret married her cousin, Graham Wilmot Brooke, and went with him as part of the ill-fated mission to Lokoja, Nigeria. Though this was a mission affiliated with the Church Missionary Society (CMS), the missionaries were independent of the society.Papers of Graham Wilmot Brooke, Church Missionary Society Archive, Birmingham University Library It was a mission made up of young, middle-class, university-educated men, and Margaret, who were radically evangelical, and inspired by James Hudson Taylor and his work with the China Inland Mission. The Lokoja mission came under the purview of the first Black African bishop, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, and has been criticised for its insensitive treatment of Crowther's regime. Margaret Brooke was instrumental in writing the official journal of the mission when her husband was disabled by illness and played a role in the production of the mission's newsletter that was published and circulated back in England by the CMS.Papers of Graham Wilmot Brooke, Church Missionary Society Archive, Birmingham University Library Later life Violence and illness precipitated Margaret's return to England with her son, Duncan. Graham Brooke died in Lokoja in 1892. On being widowed, Margaret Brooke returned to Westfield College where she provided some secretarial assistance to Constance Maynard. She lived in Hampshire with her son, until he died in 1897, aged seven.Constance Maynard Papers, Queen Mary Archives Margaret Brooke died in 1944.

For this reason they are neither a fully de facto nor a de jure Government\\". In 1968, Fieldsend resigned from the bench after the High Court dismissed the applications for stays of execution by three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, stating that his continuation in office \\"amounts to accepting the abandonment of the 1961 Constitution\\". After his resignation, Fieldsend left Rhodesia for the United Kingdom, where he worked for the Law Commission, serving as its secretary from 1978 to 1980. That year, he was invited by Robert Mugabe to become the first Chief Justice of the now-independent Zimbabwe, serving until 1987. He then served as the Chief Justice of the Turks and Caicos Islands from 1985 to 1987 and Chief Justice of the British Indian Ocean Territory from 1987 to 1999.

Early life and education  Hamann's father was an Oldenburg border guard and ambassador in Ellwitz. Hamann completed an apprenticeship as a mechanic at the Nautical Institute in Bremerhaven and visited the pilot school there. Afterwards he attended the mathematical- mechanical institute of A. Ott in Kempten (Allg√§u) in the workshops of Carl Zeiss in Jena and in the workshop of Carl Bamberg in Berlin.  Career  In 1896 he founded the Mathematical-Mechanical Institute in Berlin-Friedenau, where he developed and built mathematical instruments and surveying instruments. In 1900, he received the gold medal for his instruments at the World Exposition in Paris. Around 1889 he developed the calculation machines Gauss and Berolina inspired in part by the Gauss computing machine of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and the stepped reckoner drum. In 1907, his institute was taken over by Mercedes B√ºromaschinen in Berlin. There, he designed the Mercedes Euklid computing machine with the Proportional Lever principle developed by Hamann. He also improved machines for accounting. In 1909 he built a difference engine. From 1922 he worked for Deutsche Telephonwerke und Kabelindustrie in Berlin (DeTeWe). From 1925 onwards, he developed the shifting system as a propulsion system for computing machines. As chief designer, Christel Hamann and his colleague Heinrich Wilhelm created the essential foundations for the DeTeWe computing machines built as far back as the 1960s, Before the electronics displaced the electromechanics. In 1933 he became an honorary doctor at the TH Berlin. He was married to Hedwig Schindler (1872‚Äì1949) but had no children.

Philip by Hans D√∂ring. Philipp, Count of Solms-Lich (15 August 1468 - 3 October 1544, Frankfurt) was a German nobleman. He ruled as Count of Solms zu Lich. He was also a councilor at the courts of Maximilian I, Charles V and Frederick III as well as a patron of art and architecture. Life He was the son of Kuno of Solms-Lich and Walpurgis of Dhaun-Kyrburg and a younger brother of John of Solms. He studied in Mainz, Heidelberg and Erfurt. On 15 February 1489 he married Adriana of Hanau (1 May 1470 - 12 April 1524), a daughter of Philipp I, Count of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and his wife Adriana of Nassau- Dillenburg. They were related (albeit distantly) and so the marriage required a papal dispensation. The marriage contract stipulated a 5,000 florin dowry with an additional 'widerlage' of 6,000 florins and a 'morgengabe' of 1,000 florins - Philip had some difficulty raising the sum and it was only in 1506 that she received her dowry. The couple had twelve children. As a councilor at the Imperial court, he strengthened his claims on his lands - in 1494 he was freed from the judgement of the Reichshofgericht or high imperial court. He was also exempted from appearing before all other courts and by so doing the emperor gave up his last rights in the county of Solms-Lich. He probably moved to become a councilor at the court of Frederick III between 1506 and 1514 - there he met the painter Hans D√∂ring, who he made his official painter. He was also drawn by Durer in 1518 and painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1520. The rebuilding of the Burg Hohensolm around this time was probably undertaken by Philip, whilst he also built a residence at Lich. He, the Landgrave of Hesse and the bishop of Trier were probably the builders of the Marienkirche in Niederweidbach (now a district of Bischoffen) - he paid for the church's altar and he and his family were painted on its donation board, probably by D√∂ring. In 1510 he began rebuilding the Marienstiftskirche in Lich. On Frederick's behalf Philipconcluded a marriage contract between John Frederick and Charles V's sister Katharina in 1519, but the plan failed. In 1520 he and Franz von Sickingen joined forces to protect Martin Luther from possible arrest. Via Ulrich von Hutten, Sickingen asserted Luther's protection and Philip may have offered a safe overnight stay to Luther en route to the 1521 Diet of Worms. After Frederick's death Philip entered the service of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. Philip was made ruler of Sonnewalde in Lower Lusatia in 1537 and of Alt-Pouch in 1544. However, he remained Catholic for political reasons when the Landgrave converted to Lutheranism, backing the Holy Roman Emperor on the question of the Augsburg Confession, though he is said to have converted to Lutheranism on his deathbed. He was buried in Lich. See also *Dorothea of Mansfeld  Bibliography (in German)  * Friedrich Battenberg (Bearb.): Solmser Urkunden.

Sanford House is a historic house on Hat Shop Hill Road in Bridgewater, Connecticut. Probably built in the early 19th century, it was extensively altered later in that century, achieving an exterior Italianate form that is the finest in the town, and an interior exhibiting various stages of alteration. It was owned by Frederick and Glover Sanford, owners of a prominent local hat making factory. The property was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Frederick S. Sanford House is located in a rural residential area west of the village center of Bridgewater, on the north side of Hat Shop Hill Road. It is a two- story wood frame structure, roughly cubical in shape, with a three-story tower projecting from the center of the front facade. Deck sections extend beside the tower and in front of it, with supporting square paneled posts. The tower has round-arch windows in the second and third levels, with a decorative Gothic hood sheltering the second-floor windows, and an extended eave with brackets around those at the top of the tower. The interior exhibits a combination of mainly Greek Revival and Italianate elements, reflective of the building's major periods of alteration. and Nehemiah Sanford moved to what is now Bridgewater (then the eastern parish of New Milford) in 1772. His son Glover entered into the hat-making business, establishing a factory in 1823 east of this property that employed 125 by the end of the 19th century. The property he purchased included what was probably a 1-1/2 story Cape style house that forms the core of this house. It underwent two major alterations: the first was probably before 1849, the date of his son Frederick's marriage, after which the house was jointly owned by father and son. Both men were politically active, the father serving in town government, and the son representing the area in the state legislature. The house was sold out of the family in 1873, having by then undergone a full transformation to the Italian villa form it now has. It was later repurchased by a Sanford descendant, but again sold out of the family in 1953.

Life His coat of arms show a mill and so he may have come from a family of millers. He appears in documents of 1499, 1503 and 1511 as a student matriculating at Erfurt and in 1511 at the University of Wittenberg. His first securely-provenanced painting also dates from 1511 - it is a self-portrait with the initials \\"HD\\". He was the chief assistant of Lucas Cranach the Elder until the mid 1510s. His second known work is a painting of Lucretia from 1514, followed by altarpieces of 1515 and 1518 (including the Niederweidbach Altarpiece, which includes a self-portrait), portraits from the counts of Solms from 1515 onwards and a 1527 portrait of the Ernest Count of Mansfeld and his wife Dorothea. In 1523 he produced a wooden model for a kiln plate for casting the coat of arms of the House of Nassau.

D√∂ring also created woodcuts (mostly monogrammed) to illustrate the writings of Reinhard, Count von Solms-Lich, especially his war book of 1559/60, and may have created woodcarving designs for stove tiles.

Completed in 2019, the park has a capacity of 2,050 MW and is the World's second largest photovoltaic solar park after 2245 MW Bhadla Solar Park . and cost .  History  =Background= Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) established a joint venture company, the Karnataka Solar Power Development Corporation Ltd (KSPDCL), in March 2015 to implement solar power projects in Karnataka. The Chairman of the State High Level Clearance Committee (SLHCC) approved the KSPDCL's proposal to construct a solar power park in Pavagada taluk on 29 October 2015. The project is spread over a total area of which includes the 5 villages of Balasamudra, Tirumani, Kyataganacharlu, Vallur and Rayacharlu. Pavagada was chosen as the site for the project for several reasons. Apart from high solar radiation and availability of land, the region receives very little rainfall. Pavagada taluk is located in a semi-arid tract, atop an elevated plateau surrounded by rocky hills. The region has been declared drought hit by the Karnataka Government 54 times in the past 6 decades. The region is also scarcely populated and most of its residents are poor farmers. Many of the region's residents have migrated to Bangalore, located about 180 km away, for economic reasons. G.V. Balram, the managing director of KREDL, was born and raised in a village in Pavaguda taluk. He understood that farmers in the region were reluctant to sell their land due to emotional reasons. In order to aid in the development of the region and reduce economic migration, Balram offered farmers the option to lease the land required for the project rather than purchase it outright. Landowners receive an annual payment of per acre under the terms of the lease which is valid for 25‚Äì35 years. For the entire land required for the park, the total compensation for the entire project amounts to 23-25 crore per year. The annual payment amount will increase by 5% every 2 years. = Auctions = The KSPDCL utilized the \\"plug and play\\" model to implement the project. Under this model, the company acquires blocks of land, obtains all required government approvals for solar power generation, and then awards contracts to solar power developers (SPDs) through auctions. In April 2016, NTPC Limited, on behalf of KSPDCL, awarded contracts to 6 firms for the commissioning of a total of 500 MW of power at the Pavaguda Solar Park. Parampujya Solar Energy Pvt Ltd., Fortum Finnsurya Energy Pvt Ltd., ACME Solar Holdings Pvt Ltd, and Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd were awarded 100 MW each, while Yarrow Infrastructure and Renew Power received 50 MW each. Yarrow Infrastructure quoted the lowest tariff of per unit, Renew Power quoted the highest (4.80), while the other 4 firms quoted a tariff of 4.79 per unit. Work on the solar park began in October 2016. In March 2017, the NTPC invited bids for 750 MW, split into six blocks of 125 MW each, of solar power capacity at Pavagada. In May 2018, SB Energy has secured 200 megawatts of capacity at Rs 2.82/kWh, or 4.16¬¢/kWh offered by SECI. The most recent letter of award (LoA) was given to Amar Raja Power Systems Limited, to construct 50 MW of capacity at a levelized tariff of ‚Çπ1.24 (~$1.7¬¢)/kWh for 24 years. The reason for the extremely low cost was quoted as 'land being available to KREDL at no cost and the availability of the power evacuation infrastructure up to the sub-station.' = Commissioning = On 14 December 2017, Fortum announced that it had connected a 100MW solar plant at Pavagada to the grid. Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd commissioned 100 MW at the park by 19 December, and an additional 50 MW by 2 January 2018. 600 MW of power was commissioned by 31 January 2018. and a further 1,400 MW are planned. Pavagada Solar Park had a total commissioned capacity of 1,400 MW by 9 April 2019 out of total 2,050 MW planned by December 2019. Another 450 MW was commissioned by November 2019 taking the total project capacity to 1850 MW and it has become the largest solar power plant in the world. Wind energy In March 2017, Karnataka Energy Minister DK Shivakumar told the Bangalore Mirror that the government was looking to generate wind energy by setting up windmills in Pavagada. Preliminary estimates from the KREDL indicate a potential wind power generation of 250-300 MW.

On December 13, 1941 the area was proclaimed a National Historic Site by the Japanese government. Overview The date of the castle‚Äôs foundation is unknown, with local legend attributing it to the Kamakura period general Kitabatake Akiie or to Nanbu clan ancestor Nanbu Masamitsu (d.1265) or Nanbu Masanaga (d. 1360). The Nanbu clan claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji of Kai Province. Minamoto no Yoshimitsu was awarded Kai Province following the Gosannen War, and his great-grandson Nobuyoshi took the surname Takeda. Another great grandson, Mitsuyuki, took the name \\"Nanbu\\", after the location of his estates in Kai Province, which are now part of the town of Nanbu, Yamanashi. \\"Nanbu-shi\\" on Harimaya.com (accessed 15 August 2008) Nanbu Mitsuyuki joined Minamoto no Yoritomo at the Battle of Ishibashiyama and served in various mid-level positions within the Kamakura shogunate and is mentioned several times in the Azuma Kagami. He accompanied Yoritomo in the conquest of the Hiraizumi Fujiwara in 1189, and was awarded with vast estates in Nukanobu District the extreme northeast of Honsh≈´, building Sh≈çjujidate Castle. Shichinohe was the location of a cadet branch of the Nanbu clan for several generations, and their fortified manor house was rebuilt extensively towards the end of the Sengoku period. The castle was a hirayama-style castle built on a 40-meter hilltop spreading northwest from a junction between the Sakuda and Wada rivers. It originally consisted of seven enclosures, each with earthen ramparts, and with several moats. However, in 1591 the Shichinohe-branch of the Nanbu clan opposed the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Kunohe Rebellion and were defeated. The castle was abandoned in 1592 and allowed to fall into ruins. The clan was allowed to survive as 2300 koku hatamoto under the main lineage of the Nanbu clan at Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. Their revenues were increased to 5000 koku in 1694, and they were given charge of a daikansho erected on the site of their old castle in 1804. With a raise in revenues to 11,000 koku in 1819, Shichinohe Domain was created. In 1858, the daimy≈ç of Shichinohe, Nanbu Nobunori was raised to the status of castellan and granted formal permission to rebuild Shichinohe Castle as part of Japan‚Äôs increased defensive preparations again possible foreign incursions in light of the recent Perry Expedition. However, the Meiji restoration occurred before any construction could begin, and in 1873, the Shichinohe jin'ya was also abandoned. Only scattered stone and earthen ramparts, and a small portion of an inner moat remain. A wooden reconstruction of one gate marks the entrance to the site, which is now a local city park. A Shinto shrine, the Shichinohe Shimmei-g≈´ is now located on the site of the main bailey. In 1996, excavations in the sites of the main and second bailey uncovered relics from the 15th century.

They are recognized by a specific set of mineralogical, geochemical, textural, and isotopic characteristics. S-type granites are over-saturated in aluminium, with an ASI index greater than 1.1 where ASI = Al2O3 / (CaO + Na2O +K2O) in mol percent; petrographic features are representative of the chemical composition of the initial magma as originally put forth by Chappell and White are summarized in their table 1.  Mineralogy  = Primary Minerals (present in the magma during crystallization) = = Major Minerals (present in amounts > 5 volume%) = Like all granites, the modal mineralogy of S-type granites are dominated by alkali- and plagioclase feldspars and quartz. Thus, S-type granites are silica over-saturated (contain quartz), and do not contain feldspathoids. An interesting feature of S-type granites, at the hand sample scale, is that alkali-feldspars are typically white in color (rather than pink) excluding samples that have been affected by weathering and alteration. A photomicrograph, taken in cross-polarized light, of alkali feldspar from the S-type Strathbogie Granite of Australia is shown in figure 1. Examples of granite textures and mineralogy as seen in sawn-slabs from hand samples collected from granites of the Lachlan Fold Belt, Australia are shown. This includes enclaves of dark, lineated, ovoid, metamorphic rocks in the S-type Cooma Granodiorite. These enclaves are considered to represent restite by some researchers and meta-sedimentary xenoliths by others. The S-type Granya Granite shows the characteristic white feldspars, grey quartz, and black biotite, the highly reflective mineral is muscovite. The S-type Strathbogie Granite crops out in the Strathbogie Ranges of Australia. A hand sample from the Strathbogie Granite has a porphyritic texture with larger crystal of grey quartz, called phenocrysts, set in a finer grain matrix of quartz and feldspar. The darker, prismatic, phenocrysts in this sample of the Strathbogie Granite are cordierite. Geologists use differences in mineralogy and texture, such as shown here, to subdivide large granite batholiths into subdomains on geologic maps. Hand sample of CC-1 from the S-type Cooma Granodiorite, Australia. Hand sample of VB-140 from the S-type Granya Granite, Australia. Hand sample of CV-114 S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia. Figure 1. Photomicrograph of perthitic texture in alkali-feldspar (center) from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. (Cross polarized light). Sample CV-114. = Characteristic Minor Minerals (present in amounts > 1% and < 5 volume%) = Figure 2a. Cross-polarized light photomicrograph showing garnet and biotite and plagioclase in the sample CV-126 from the mafic S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia. Minor minerals in S-type granites reflect the aluminium saturation or ASI Index of the rock being greater than 1.1 mol%. These minerals include cordierite, muscovite, garnet, and sillimanite. Within S-type volcanics, cordierite occurs in place of clinopyroxene. The presence of these aluminous silicate minerals are commonly used as a means of initially classifying granites as ‚ÄúS-type‚Äù. Photomicrographs of these minerals in thin section from S-type granites of the Lachlan Fold Belt are shown in figure 2a and 2b. S-type granites can also contain aluminium-rich, iron and magnesium rich biotites. Biotite compositions from S-type granites are more aluminous than those of I-type granites consistent with the higher ASI index of S-type Granites. Figure 2b. Plane polarized light photomicrograph showing garnet and biotite in sample CV-126 from the mafic S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia. Figures 3a and 3b are photomicrographs of thin sections of sample CC-1 from the Cooma Granodiorite, Lachlan Fold Belt, Australia. Figure 3a Plane polarized light photomicrograph showing the mineral Sillimanite surrounded by biotite and muscovite in sample CC-1 from the Cooma Granodiorite, Australia. Figure 3b Cross polarized light photomicrograph showing the mineral Sillimanite surrounded by biotite and muscovite in sample CC-1 from the Cooma Granodiorite, Australia. In plane polarized light (PPL, Fig. 3a) the mineral biotite is light brown to \\"foxy\\" red brown with dark circular spots known as ‚Äúpleochroic halos‚Äù. Muscovite is clear and sillimanite is the more acicular- fibrous mineral within the dark zone of the image. In cross polarized light (Fig. 3b) muscovite displays colorful birefringence and sillimanite is of the variety \\"fibrolite\\". Sillimanite is considered a diagnostic mineral for peraluminous S-type granites. Figure 4a and 4b, show the mineral cordierite, which is also considered to be a diagnostic mineral for peraluminous S-type granites in the Strathbogie Granite (sample CV-142). Subhedral cordierite phenocryst shown here is colorless in plane polarized light, but can display a light blue color in some minerals, and is grey in cross-polarized light. It is an orthorhombic mineral and displays a prismatic crystal form with imperfect cleavage. Figure 4a. Plane polarized light photomicrograph of cordierite in sample CV-142 from the Strathbogie S-type Granite, Australia. Figure 4b. Cross-polarized light photomicrograph showing cordierite from sample CV-142 of the S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia. = Accessory Minerals (present in amounts < 1 volume%) = Accessory minerals commonly observed in S-type granites include zircon, apatite, tourmaline, monazite, and xenotime. Monazite is considered a diagnostic accessory mineral of S-type granites, whereas allanite is diagnostic of I-type granites. Oxide minerals in S-type granites will more commonly be ilmenite rather than magnetite. Accessory minerals in S-type granites commonly are associated with, or occur as inclusions, in biotite. For example, apatite occurs in S-type granites in greater modal abundance and as larger, discrete crystals than in the I-type granites. Figure 5a, 5b, and 5c show the mineral tourmaline associated with quartz in sample CV-114 from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. Figures 5a and 5b are both in plane polarized light with the orientation of tourmaline rotated to show its characteristic change in color known as pleochroism. Figure 5a. Plane polarized light photomicrograph of tourmaline in sample CV-114 from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. Figure 5b. Plane polarized light photomicrograph of tourmaline in sample CV-114 from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. The thin section has been slightly rotated to show the characteristic change in color of the tourmaline known as pleochroism. Figure 5c. Cross-polarized light photomicrograph of tourmaline in sample CV-114 from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. The calcium phosphate mineral apatite is a common accessory minerals of S-type granites. It is typically spatially associated with the mineral biotite. Figure 6 is a plane polarized light photomicrograph showing apatite crystals (clear) included in a brown biotite grain from sample CV-126 of the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. The dark circles with a clear center are pleochroic halos which form as the result of radiation damage to the biotite from mineral inclusions that contain high concentrations of uranium and/or thorium. Figure 6. Plane polarized photomicrograph of apatite inclusions in a biotite from sample CV-126 of the Strathbogie Granite, Australia. = Alteration and Subsolidus (post crystallization) Minerals = Alteration in S-type granites can produce, in order of abundance, chlorite, white mica, clay minerals, epidote, and sericite. Cordierite and sillimanite are rarely seen without alteration halos of white mica, chlorite, muscovite, and clay minerals, and can be identified easily by the presence of these halos.  Petrologic Characteristics  = Color Indexes = The color index of S-type granites can vary from melanocratic to leucocratic. Higher color index correlate with higher plagioclase to alkali feldspar ratios. The most common high color index mineral in an S-type granite is biotite. = Textures = S-type granites, like other granite types, can vary in crystal size from aphanitic to phaneritic; crystal size distributions include porphyritic, seriate, and rarely equigranular textures. Mafic xenoliths/enclaves can be found in S-type granites. Granophyric textures can be found in S-type granites, particularly leucocratic ones. In porphyritic S-type granites, phenocrysts are commonly feldspars, but can also be quartz, and in rare cases, such as the Strathbogie Granite, cordierite. Figure 7 shows an example of granophyric texture in the Strathbogie Granite. The mineral quartz (light grey to off white) forms irregular to angular crystals of varying size that are intimately intergrown with the mineral feldspar (dark grey) indicating rapid crystallization. Figure 7. Cross-polarized light photomicrograph of sample CV-114 from the S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia, with quartz and feldspar displaying a granophyric texture. = Pressure Quenching = A rapid change in pressure, from loss of volatile components (e.g., dissolved water in the melt) during crystallization can lead to a period of rapid crystallization. Change in crystal growth forms that are interpreted to occur as a result of this loss in pressure are known as \\"pressure-quenching\\" textures. Figure 8 is a photomicrograph in cross-polarized light showing alkali-feldspar (perthite core)-quartz (in extinction near the feldspar crystal rim) intergrowth, overgrown by a partial rim of plagioclase texture in Sample CV-114 from the Strathbogie Granite, Australia (cross polarized light). This texture is interpreted to represent partial quenching possibly due to a loss of pressure. Figure 8. Cross-polarized light photomicrograph of a \\"pressure-quench\\" texture in sample Cv-114 from the S-type Strathbogie Granite, Australia.  Geochemistry  = Major Elements = Major element characteristics of S-type granites include lower levels of sodium and calcium, and elevated levels of silica and aluminium. Iron and magnesium content correlate with color index in S-type granites. In addition, S-type granites contain more magnesium than iron. With respect to aluminium, S-type granites are always peraluminous, or have a total alkali (+Calcium) to aluminium ratio of greater than one. = Trace elements = S-type granites contain elevated levels of K, Rb and Pb, and are depleted in Sr. With respect to rare earth elements, S-type granites are light rare earth element depleted compared to other granite types. = Isotopic Characteristics = Strontium isotope characteristics in S-type granites are more variable and radiogenic than for I-type plutons. With respect to Oxygen isotopes, S-type granites are enriched in heavy oxygen. Zircons within S-type granites can be inherited and can predate the emplacement of the granite.  Interpretation  = Source Characteristics = S-type granites are so named as a shorthand for ‚ÄúSupracrustal‚Äù type. The interpretation of S-type granites are that they are sourced from the partial melting of sedimentary rocks (supracrustal) that have been through one or more cycles of weathering. Evidence for this include aluminium and silica enrichment, caused by the weathering process of the source rock. Weathering causes alkalis, like sodium, to leave the rock and therefore enrich the rock in non-soluble components. = The I-S Line = The I-S line is an observed contact between I- and S-type granites in an igneous terrane. This contact is usually clearly defined; one example of this occurring is within the Lachlan fold belt of Australia. The I-S line is interpreted to be the location of a paleo-structure in the subsurface that separated the generation zones of the two different melts. = Suites and Supersuites = Granite plutons can be grouped into suites and super suites by their source regions, which in turn are interpreted by comparing their compositions. This interpretation comes from the plotting of different element concentrations against the level of evolution of the granite, usually as percent silica or its magnesium to iron ratio. Igneous rocks with the same source region will plot along a line in silica to element space. = Restite Unmixing = Granites traced to the same source region can often have very variable mineralogy; color index for example can vary greatly within the same batholith. In addition, many minerals resist melting and would not melt at the temperatures known to create the magmas that form S-type granites. One theory that explains this mineralogic anomaly is restite unmixing. In this theory, minerals that are resistant to melting, such as the mafic silicate minerals (e.g., the color index minerals), do not melt but are rather brought up by the melt in solid state. Melts that are farther from their source regions would therefore contain lower modal abundance of the color index minerals, while those closer to their source regions would have a higher color index. This theory supplements the theories of partial melting and fractional crystallization. = Other Models = [Magma mixing][Crustal assimilation][Source region mixing] More recent studies have shown that the source regions of I-type and S-type magmas cannot be homogeneously igneous or sedimentary, respectively. Instead, many magmas show signs of being sourced from a combination of source materials. These magmas can be characterized by having a series of neodymium and hafnium isotope characteristics that can be thought of as a combination of both I- and S-type isotopic characteristics. Magma mixing is another aspect of granite formation that must be taken into account when observing granites. Magma mixing occurs when magmas of a different composition intrude a larger magma body. In some cases, the melts are immiscible and stay separated to form pillow like collections of denser mafic magmas on the bottom of less dense dense felsic magma chambers. The mafic pillow basalts will demonstrate a felsic matrix, suggesting magma mingling. Alternatively, the melts mix together and form a magma of a composition intermediate to the intrusive and intruded melt.

Schoverling Tobacco Warehouse is a historic industrial storage building at 1 Wellsville Avenue in New Milford, Connecticut. Also known locally as the Flatiron Building, it was built in 1897 by one of the region's leading tobacco processing businesses, and is one of only two such buildings to surviving from period in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Schoverling Tobacco Warehouse stands north of downtown New Milford, occupying a roughly triangular lot at the northern junction of Wellsville Avenue and Housatonic Avenue. It is a two-story wood frame structure with a flat roof, clapboarded exterior, and partially exposed brick foundation. It presents a narrow two-bay facade to the street junction, and gradually widens. Its main facade is the long side facing Wellness Avenue, while the western facade, facing Housatonic Avenue, is where shipping activities were originally focused. The building interior retains massive timber framing, and a rare example of an early elevator, originally powered by a water pump. and When this warehouse was built in 1897, it was described as one of the most advanced tobacco warehouses in the country, featuring all of the latest amenities. New Milford was then the primary center for processing tobacco leaf grown in the Housatonic River valley, used for wrapping cigars. It was built by Carl Schoverling, the son and nephew of two German immigrants who were major figures in the local tobacco industry. The building originally had wings extending to the west (where Housatonic Avenue) now runs, and was conveniently sited near the Housatonic Railroad. Its use by the Schoverlings was short-lived: the business closed in 1903, apparently due to setbacks caused by repeated crop failures. After passing through bank ownership, it was again used as a tobacco warehouse into the 1930s, after which it has been used by a variety of other businesses.

In October 2015, she won the World Judo Championships Juniors both individual (‚Äì57 kg weight class) and team event. She won 5 out of 8 bouts with Funakubo-Gatame for Ippon. In 2017, she became a member of the Judo club at the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group. In February 2017, she won all bouts with Funakubo- Gatame for Ippon at the European Open Sofia. In April 2017, she became vice champion at the All-Japan weight championships. In October 2017, she retained the world junior title as well as the team title. In September 2018, she won the Asian Games team event. In October 2018, she won the world junior title as well as the team title three times in a row. Funakubo-Gatame Funakuo's favorite technique is Newaza, especially Osaekomi-waza called Funakubo-Gatame. Funakubo-Gatame is considered a modified Hara-Zutsumi(stomach wrap grabbing) technique.Hara-Zutsumi originates from Nanatei Judo This is officially classified as Kuzure-Kesa-Gatame or Kata-Gatame. When she was in the second grade at junior high school, she couldn't practice Judo because of a knee injury. Thus she was doing 1000 Pull‚Äêups every day for a month. After the recovery, she invented Funakubo-Gatame to turn over an opponent in a prone position. Some in the media say Funakubo looks like the actress Rena N≈çnen.

It is dedicated to languages and to literary authors who use a \\"mother tongue\\", a present-day minority language of territorial belonging, in their works. The event began in 2008 and is held in Ostana, a municipality in the Valle Po (Italy), every year at the beginning of June. It is open to the public with free admission. Categories of Ostana Prize Every year, the Ostana Prize assigns prizes to authors selected all over the world according to different categories, some of which were added only in the recent editions: International Award, National Award, Award for the Occitan language, Young Writers Award, Special Award, Translation Award, Award for Musical Composition, Film Award. For the International Award and the National Award the organizers select authors who have used in their works, in whole or in part, one of the minority languages recognized at national and international level. Because of the geographical location of Ostana Prize in the Occitan Area (the municipality of Ostana is in fact part of the Occitan minority area in Italy) an author writing in the language is given a specific recognition. The Special Award is conferred to an author who is particularly distinguished in the defense, promotion and dissemination of a minority language in danger of extinction. The Translation Award is awarded to an author who has achieved distinction in the translation of writings to, or from, a minority language. The Young Writers Award is given to an under-40 author who has achieved distinction in the field of literature and who is engaged in the promotion of his or her mother tongue. In 2016 edition two awards to artistic career were added: The Award for Musical Composition which is awarded to an author who has been noteworthy in the field of composition in his or her native language, and The Film Award which is given to a filmmaker who made a cinematographic work in a minority language. Duration of award ceremony The Ostana Prize ‚Äì Writings in Mother Tongue has a duration of three days during which the winning authors are invited by the organizers to reside in Ostana, in one of the existing facilities, and to take part in: meetings, debates, video projections, readings in minority languages, musical and artistic performances, photographic exhibitions, etc...

It was his first major commissional work made for the private chapel of Eleonora de‚Äô Medici Gonzaga (1567‚Äì1611), duchess of Mantua. The painting remained somewhat obscure until 2005, when it was discovered by German art historian Justus M√ºller-Hofstede, a specialist on Rubens' early work.  Description  The large-sized altarpiece revolutionizes the usual illustrations of Jesus' Descent from the Cross of the Cinquecento and engrosses the idea of the holy Eucharist: The kneeling lady in the foreground as a symbolic embodiment of the duchess who receives the Body of Christ like a lover for supper (cf. ). Stylistically, the painting is comparable to another early work created approximately at the same time: ‚ÄûThe Elevation of the Cross‚Äú for the chapel of the church Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, which offers the same perspective to the mourning group of women.Peter Paul Rubens: Die Kreuzaufrichtung (1601)  History  Rubens knew the descent from the cross (pieta bandini) by Michelangelo, either by an engraving by Cherubino Alberti or he saw the pieta personified in Rome. Engaged by the duchess of Mantua, Eleonora Gonzaga, Rubens joined a competition (paragone) with the sculptor and created a new composition. Rubens adjusted the commissional work for the duchess Eleonora de‚Äô Medici in Mantua exactly to the dimensions of the reredos. Rubens as the creator of the painting is proven archivally since it was copied by the court painter Francesco Marcoleoni in 1611 (after the duchess' death) for the church Santa Maria Assunta in Susano. The historic text describes Marcoleoni's copy and Rubens' original reference as follows: [...] Un Christo che togliono di croce, che coppi√≤ messer Francesco Marco Leone che viene da Pietro Paolo Fiamingo, et √® originale nella capella di Santa Croce di sopra in Corte [...]. After early drafts (Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Rubens devoted himself also in later periods to the idea of the Descent from the Cross, among them the famous triptych The Descent from the Cross in Antwerp and works on the subject in Lille, St Petersburg and Arras (1610).

It was first described by Edmond de S√©lys Longchamps in 1876.  Habitat and distribution  Acanthagrion quadratum distribution Acanthagrion quadratum is found in ponds with abundant vegetation, slow creeks and open marshes; also in marshy areas under the vegetation cover. It is distributed from the southern United States to Costa Rica. In Mexico, it has been recorded in the states of Campeche, Chiapas, Coahuila, Hidalgo, Nuevo Le√≥n, Oaxaca, Puebla, Quer√©taro, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potos√≠, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Yucat√°n. It is an abundant species.  Description and identification  Adult males have a distinctive abdominal tip. The eyes mostly black with green tones at the bottom and large blue post-ocular spots. It has a blue thorax with medium blue and black humeral stripes and a thin white line at the sides. The abdomen is black with blue portions on the sides of segment 1 to 2, the final part of segment 7, and 8 to 9. Females are similar in color to males, but with lighter eyes. Their thorax is paler blue, while the abdomen has marks on the sides and tip, usually the base of segment eight is blue. The number 9 segment is blue with black marks on each side of the base. Segment 10 completely blue. The tip of the abdomen is quite variable and less blue in more Southerly distributions.Novelo-Guti√©rrez, R. (2009). Description of the larva of Acanthagrion. Odonatologica, 38(4), 321-328 The larvae are distinguished from others of the same genus, by having 3 premental setae, 4 setae in the lip palpus and a caudal lamella 8 to 10 times longer than its widest part.  Natural history  Males and females perch at a low height at the height of the water or are distributed along beds of herbaceous vegetation. The males rise in the air as they face each other, exposing themselves with the tip of their abdomen raised. Pairs lay their eggs in herbaceous vegetation.

Jansson regularly contributes to publications such as American and French Vogue, Interview Magazine as well as photographing campaigns for luxury brands such as Est√©e Lauder, Coach, Calvin Klein and Louis Vuitton. Jansson garnered international attention in 1998 when he published a nude portfolio in Dutch, then considered by industry insiders the leading avant-garde magazine. The feature spanned 82 pages and included fashion credits to nude images in a nod to Andy Warhol. Jansson currently divides his time between London and New York. Early life Jansson grew up in Stockholm, where he was born. In the 1970s and early 80s, Jansson photographed popular bands coming to Stockholm behind the stage and in VIP areas, such as Blondie, Roxy Music, Iggy, Bowie and the Clash, as well as musicians Chet Baker and Miles Davis. He then took on an assistant role with Swedish photographer Carl-Johan R√∂nn, where he received an education in the works of Stieglitz, Brassa√Ø, Cartier-Bresson, Kerst√©sz and Lartigue. Five years thereafter, he moved to New York to assist Richard Avedon during the time Avedon was working on In the American West. Career In 1987 Jansson returned to Stockholm and set up his own studio and darkroom, which maintains his archive today. By the early 90s, Jansson had moved to Paris and established his career as an international fashion photographer working for magazines such as French Glamour, British Vogue, Italian Vogue, Numero, Arena Hommes Plus and Stockholm New, a magazine Jansson helped pioneer.

The railway was known as Bankura Damodar Railway, as it used to terminate at Rainagar, which was on banks of Damodar River. People used to take ferries to cross river to go on other side. The standard locomotive for BDR was a powerful 0-6-4T design from W. G. Bagnall of Stafford, but during the First World War some 2-6-2T engines were also obtained from Bagnall, same as was ordered for the Egyptian Delta Light Railways (and hence known as the Delta class). The 1953 additions were also of this type. There were two Sentinel locomotives; one (No.8) is now preserved at the National Rail Museum, New Delhi. A steam loco shed at Bankura served the narrow gauge line. The BDR services were withdrawn in 1995 after it incurred huge losses due to higher maintenance costs, falling passenger numbers as well as falling freight. In 2005, the 120 kilometers long railway section was converted to broad gauge and train services were resumed which extended its part to Masagram, in 2012 thus connecting Howrah‚ÄìBardhaman chord.

Bagnall Ltd. of the Castle Engine Works at Stafford in England. They entered service with KFR in February 1917. The 'AK' in the name stood for 'Ahmedpur-Katwa'. They were also known as the 'Delta Class' engines (since they were originally ordered by the Egyptian Delta Light Railways but were more successful in India) and they were very successful and a lot many were used in the following years till 1953 when the last order was placed.

It is a small line‚Äî26‚Äô2 miles of narrow gauge. A private company was running it at a deficit and according to the agreement entered into with that company by the Central Government, we have been paying a subsidy, on an average, of Rs. 3 71 lakhs, from year to year. Therefore, we decided that it will be better to take over this and dismantle it, if adequate facilities are provided for the public. The West Bengal Government also took up the matter with us and they gave an assurance that they would make all possible efforts; they said that the road services would be sufficiently developed in that area to cope with the normal traffic; That is the position so far as public are concernedhttps://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/56093/1/lsd_01_15_28-03-1957.pdf page 30 As regards the staff of the KalighatFalta railway, it has been decidedby the Government ol India to offer fresh employment to such of the staff as are below the age of superannuation and are otherwise found suitable. Detailed instructions in this connection have already issued to the General Managers of the Eastern and the South-Eastern Railways So, on both these points, namely, hardship to the public and unemployment to the staff, we have taken measures so that the public will not be put to inconvenience when this line is eventually dismantled and the staff who have not superannuated will be offered alternative employment. Due to ever-increasing losses, the KFR was closed in 1957. The land where the tracks used to be was used to construct a road, the James Long Sarani, in Behala.

Early life The daughter of Margaretha Elisabeth Hvistendahl (1756‚Äì1816) and economist Jacob Mandix (1758‚Äì1831), Lucie Marie Mandix was born on 19 February 1792 in Copenhagen. She was taught painting by the Danish flower painter Cladius Detlev Fritzsch. There also are records of her painting in Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg's studio. When she was 20, she was engaged to the writer Bernhard Severin Ingemann, whom she married in July 1822. They lived in Sor√∏, where they entertained other Danish cultural figures such as Hans Christian Andersen and Bertel Thorvaldsen. Bernhard Ingemann, who wrote poetry, supported Lucie's interest in painting. Career Although Ingemann painted a few portraits and genre works, she concentrated mainly on flower paintings and, from the mid-1820s, on religious figures. She showed at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1824 and 1826, in both cases presenting flower paintings. She shared with her husband a deep sense of art and religion with the result that even her flower paintings often reflected religious and mystical themes inspired by German Romanticism. Her large biblical compositions and altar paintings are convincing, perhaps thanks to the guidance of Johan Ludwig Lund. In some cases she abandons perspective in favour of a spaciousness depicting spiritual mystery. Her many religious works were integrated in altarpieces in Danish churches, although many have now been removed. Ingemann is one of the few known nineteenth-century women who devoted her life to painting. She also played an important role in the Ingemanns' home despite the fact that references to her come mainly from accounts of her husband's life. Death Lucie Ingemann died in Sor√∏ on 15 January 1868.
