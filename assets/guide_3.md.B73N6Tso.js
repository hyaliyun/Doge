The idea behind establishing Prayers for Prisoners Day is a need of promoting prayers among especially those prisoners who are standing far away from God, who do not see a point in conversion or among those who lost their faith in Divine Mercy. During his fourth pastoral visit to Poland back in 1991, pope John Paul II visited Prison in P≈Çock, turning to prisoners with words: : You are convicted, that's a truth, but you are not yet condemned.

She was a supporter of Jews living in Warsaw and patroness of the Hasidic movement in Poland. She was renowned for her largesse in her philanthropy toward Polish Hasidic leaders and tzadikim, and was said to have \\"distributed money like ashes\\". Referred to as the \\"Do√±a Gracia of Hasidism\\", she is credited with the success of the Hasidic movement in Poland in the early 19th century. Early life and marriages Temerl's father, Avraham of Opoczno, Poland, was said to be \\"learned and extremely wealthy\\". She had a sister who married Rabbi Moshe Simcha of Opoczno. Temerl was married at a young age to Jacob Jacobson, a Warsaw merchant; they had one son, Hirsch, before Jacobson died. The young widow remarried in February 1787 to Dov (Berek) Sonnenberg (1764‚Äì1822) son of Shmuel Zbitkower. Berek changed his surname to Sonnenberg during the Prussian rule of Poland. Like his father Shmuel, a court Jew who amassed a fortune by supplying both the Polish and Russian armies during the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, Berek built up a personal fortune through his own government contracts. He gave generously to Jewish causes and was known as the \\"Rothschild of Polish Jewry\\". While Berek engaged in general Jewish philanthropy, his wife Temerl directed the couple's efforts to support the Hasidic movement in Poland. Followers of Rabbi Yisroel Hopsztajn, the Maggid of Kozhnitz, they donated generously to Hasidic causes, took hundreds of Hasidic Jews into their employ, and made their home a meeting place for the movement's followers. In 1807, the couple built the first Hasidic synagogue and study hall in the Praga suburb of Warsaw. The couple was honored by the Hasidic leaders of their day with their attendance at their children's weddings; they also married their only daughter to a grandson of Shmelke of Nikolsburg. Later life After Berek's death, Temerl took over his business interests and also founded a bank. She was one of the few Jews permitted to deal in real estate. In 1810 she had purchased a home in a street \\"technically forbidden to Jews\\", and was granted an exemption from the ghetto residence laws. In 1827 she received permission from the Russian tsar to buy the estate of Jerzy de Hesse-Darmstadt, making her only the third Jew in Poland permitted to own property beyond the ghetto walls. Her support of Hasidic leaders and tzadikim also continued after her husband's death. Several impoverished Hasidic leaders reportedly rebuffed her efforts to assist them, including Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter of Ger and Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, but Rabbi Simcha Bunim of Peshischa and Rabbi Yitzchak of Vorka accepted her largesse. Temerl hired the latter two tzadikim to help manage her business interests. Her philanthropy extended to non-Hasidic Polish Jews as well; she was praised by one mitnagid (Jewish opponent of Hasidism) as \\"the Polish Hasidah\\". In 1818 she contributed close to 54,000 rubles to a Warsaw community charity, and left 300,000 z≈Çotys in her will to another local charity supporting the poor. She used her standing to influence the authorities to favor the Hasidim during the \\"anti-Hasidic investigations\\" of 1824 that were promulgated by members of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment). In one instance, she helped rescind an official order barring Hasidim from visiting the tzadikim by personally appealing to the governor of Warsaw. Hasidic leaders accorded Temerl the honorific Reb, a title traditionally given to men. Personal Temerl and Berek Bergson were both religious Jews; despite his wealth and government connections, Berek retained his beard, payot, and traditional dress. The couple had four sons and one daughter. Their sons Jacob, Leopold, and Michael later adopted the name Berekson (son of Berek). Among the descendants of Temerl and Berek Bergson were Joseph Bergson (1812‚Äì?), an instructor in medicine at the University of Warsaw; Micha≈Ç Bergson (1820‚Äì1898), a Polish composer and pianist; and Henri Bergson (1859‚Äì1941), a leading French philosopher and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

This can occur while birds are traveling south or returning to their breeding grounds. Due to the distance travelled, birds will not have enough energy to continue flight when encountering high winds. This exhaustion results in many birds resting in one area. This may be very stressful on the birds and on the surrounding ecology. Bird fallout is not particularly common, as it stems from the chance event of severe winds found in inclement weather. Due to the rare occurrence of a migratory fallout, as well as the abundance of birds resting in a single location, it is a sought-after event for birders. Consequences There can be some significant consequences due to birds encountering severe weather during their migratory flyway. Late arrival to their destination can lead to a delay in reproduction, or a higher mortality rate. Due to the large number of birds resting, a lack of shelter and food becomes a large concern for the survival and propagation to the wintering destination. Notable incidents The most notable incident occurred on 25 April 2013, where 294 species of birds were recorded as a result of fallout at High Island, Texas caused by rain and high winds.

The policy was enacted in 1984 by Peng Zhen and Hu Yaobang. On July 9, 2010, a statement jointly published by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, and United Front Work Department suggested that \\"everyone should be equal before the law, and criminals should be punished regardless of their ethnicity\\". However, they do not have the legal authority to challenge a policy implemented by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a higher authority; the policy has thus never been officially repealed. Background In November 1931, the policy of the treatment toward ethnic minorities by the Communist Party of China was formulated in Ruijin, Jiangxi Province, then capital of the Chinese Soviet Republic. On September 29, 1949, with communist control over most of China, the formal policy toward ethnic minorities for the future People's Republic of China was formulated. Over time, the policy was believed to be the source of tensions between the Han majority and ethnic minorities, as well as cover for ethnic minority separatists. At the time of its abolition, the policy was heavily opposed by prominent members of the ethnic minorities, who believed it encouraged criminal activity among young members of ethnic minority groups. Impact The policy is controversial in the sense of promoting social inequality.

These territories are: Catalonia, the Valencian Community (except some inland areas which are only Spanish-speaking), the Balearic Islands, Andorra, and the easternmost areas of Aragon. This linguistic contact is encouraged by the fact that almost all of the Catalan speakers in these regions are Catalan‚ÄìSpanish bilingual to a greater or lesser extent. Many of the features of this Spanish language variety are present due to the transfer of distinctive features of the Catalan language. Many speakers whose native language is Catalan feature an accent brought about through the transfer of phonetic and phonological features from Catalan; such features are recognized by the listener as a \\"Catalan accent.\\" Some of the listed features can sometimes be found in native Spanish speakers who live in Catalan-speaking areas; however, in the case of speakers who are not bilingual, this happens almost exclusively with lexical features.  Linguistic features  How a Catalan speaker's Spanish manifests depends heavily on individual sociolinguistic variables related to age, native language, and the differing environments of language use. It is therefore not a uniform variety with little variation. Many of the features listed below are present with very different frequencies in different speakers, and some of the features could be absent in many speakers (particularly those whose main native language is Spanish, who transfer fewer typical Catalan features). Most Spanish speakers in Catalan-speaking territories use linguistic forms that are not regionally marked; that is, their speech is similar to that of much of Spain; however, there is a tendency, especially among members of the working class, to use forms typical of southern Spanish dialects. Phonetics The phonetic features listed below occur much more frequently among speakers whose main language is Catalan than they do among speakers whose main language is Spanish. All of them can be considered transfer of phonetic features from Catalan to Spanish: Consonants * Word-final -d is often devoiced and fortified to : autorida, verda, amista, Madri. ** In Valencia, in the -ada suffix can be elided, as in Southern Peninsular Spanish: Mocadorada 'Mocadorada'. * can be velarized , especially in coda position. * Less presence of ye√≠smo than among native speakers, and thus distinction of ll () and y (). However, this feature is in decline; even in Catalan ye√≠smo is starting to take hold in many comarcas: Castell . * In areas where is preserved in the local form of Catalan (Balearic islands, central and southern Valencian Community), use of a v as distinct from b in cognates. * Higher frequency of voicing and the occurrence thereof between vowels. ** In part of the Valencian Community, the suffix -eza (-esa in Valencian) is commonly reduced to ea: bellea or 'beauty'. * Mainly in speakers with a limited command of Spanish, seseo, that is, the phoneme is realized as . * Also for speakers with a limited command of Spanish, and very rare nowadays, the Spanish phoneme used to be realized as . Vowels *The high vowels are more open than in Spanish. Unstressed are centralized. ** In Valencian and most Balearic dialects are further open and centralized. * The use of open realizations for stressed . In the Valencian Community, the \\"open\\" vowels (which are as low as ) are never used when speaking Spanish. * The articulation of some rising diphthongs as separate vowels in hiatus following the articulatory habits of Catalan; that is, the sequence _weak vowel_ \\\\+ _strong vowel_ is pronounced as two vowels in two separate syllables. Examples: tiene as rather than ; duele as rather than . * Articulation of the rising diphthong iu as falling . Example: ciudad as rather than . Morphology * Formation of diminutives the Catalan way, with -ete (-et in Catalan) and -eta. Although these forms are more common in Catalan-speaking territories, they also occur in other regions where Spanish is spoken, especially in eastern Spain. * More frequent use of the adjective nominalization suffix -eza, even with three-syllable adjectives that in Spanish most frequently use -ez. For example: esbelteza instead of esbeltez. * The use of ves (from Catalan v√©s) as the second-person singular informal (t√∫) imperative of the verb ir, instead of the standard ve: Ves a casa y tr√°eme la chaqueta for Ve a casa y tr√°eme el abrigo ('Go home and bring me the coat'). Syntax The following features are common: * The use of the preposition sin like Catalan sense, which can be used adverbially without a complement; therefore, for example, exchanges such as the following can occur: A: ¬øTraes la raqueta? B: He venido sin (for He venido sin ella) * The appearance of the particle que at the beginning of questions: ¬øQue te gusta el piso? instead of ¬øTe gusta el piso? ('Do you like the flat?') * The use of possessive pronouns instead of various sequences of de + _strong objective pronoun_ : Vete delante m√≠o for Vete delante de m√≠, Vamos detr√°s suyo for Vamos detr√°s de √©l. This phenomenon also occurs in many other varieties of Spanish; this occurs because of analogy with such pairs as izquierda de m√≠ and izquierda m√≠a. * Tendency to use the definite article with the names of people, often considered slang in other Spanish-speaking areas: el Jordi, la Elena. There are Spanish-speaking regions not influenced by Catalan in which this also occurs. This is different from the standard Spanish use of the definite article with personal names in such sentences as la Mar√≠a que t√∫ conoces es mi novia, no mi t√≠a ('the Mar√≠a that you know is my girlfriend, not my aunt'). * The occasional preference of haber de + instead of tener que + ('(to) have to'). Although haber de does exist in standard Spanish, it is far more common to use tener que. * Inflecting existential haber ('there be', as in \\"There is a cat on the porch.\\") such that it agrees in number with the complement *: Hab√≠an cuatro jueces en la competici√≥n rather than Hab√≠a cuatro jueces en la competici√≥n ('There were four judges in the competition') This also occurs in some non- Catalan-speaking areas; it is a typical feature of native Spanish speakers who were born in areas where historically the local speech was particularly divergent from standard Spanish (such as Zamora, C√°ceres, Navarra, Murcia). It is virtually nonexistent in the core area of Burgos-Madrid-Andalusia. * The use of certain prepositions the Catalan way: *: Estoy aqu√≠ a Barcelona for Estoy aqu√≠ en Barcelona * Deque√≠smo: Pienso de ir al teatro / Considero de que deber√≠a venir tu hermano. There are, however, internal reasons of Spanish grammar that cause the occurrence of this phenomenon outside this linguistic area. * Extended use of hacer in periphrastic expressions: hacer un caf√© con alguien for tomar un caf√© con alguien ('have coffee with someone'), hacer pi√±a for mantenerse unidos ('(to) stay united'), hacer pa√≠s for ser patriota ('(to) be patriotic'), and so forth. Lexicon * Constructions such as hacer tarde (from the Catalan fer tard), hacer un caf√© for tomar un caf√©, sacarme la camisa for quitarme la camisa, tampoco no for tampoco, and plegar del trabajo for salir del trabajo. * It is very common, especially in Catalonia, for the expression \\"D√©u n'hi do!\\" (an exclamation of conformation, adequacy, or admiration: '¬°No est√° nada mal!, ¬°Es bastante!; literally 'God gave (enough)!' in an older form of Catalan) to be used, especially since there is no exact equivalent in Spanish. * It is also common to use the Catalan word ad√©u instead of adi√≥s ('goodbye'). * In the Valencian Country, Spanish speakers that learn Valencian in school sometimes use Valencian expressions like che (written xe in Valencian) or \\"Prou!\\" (instead of \\"¬°Basta!\\") in their Spanish. The phrase no cal is also used instead of no hace falta ('it is not necessary'), despite the fact that the Castilianism no fa falta finds use in Valencian. * Particularly in the Balearic Islands, it is very common to express objections with pero (pronounced as though it were per√≥, with stress on the second syllable, like Catalan per√≤) at the end of the sentence, as in: *: \\"No viniste, per√≥!\\" *: \\"Yo no he sido, per√≥!\\" * The frequent use of prestache (from the Catalan prestatge ) to refer what is referred to as estante in standard Spanish, the use of rachola (from the Catalan rajola ) to refer what is referred to as baldosa or azulejo in standard Spanish, and the use of tocho (from the Catalan totxo ) to refer to a ladrillo: brick (figuratively, a thick book).e * Some food terms derived from Catalan can be found in Spanish-language menus in Catalonia: barat (Catalan verat) for caballa (mackerel), monchetas (Catalan mongetes) for jud√≠as (beans), to√±ina (Catalan tonyina) for at√∫n (tuna). * Other examples are enchegar (from the Catalan engegar) instead of encender or prender, or nen instead of ni√±o.

Evolutionary history Illustration by John Gerrard Keulemans (1890). As of 2005, the origin of the Sumatran dhole is unclear, as it shows a greater relatedness to the Ussuri dhole rather than with dholes in nearby Malaysia. In the absence of further data, it is speculated that the dholes of Indonesia could have been introduced to the Sunda Islands by humans. Physical description The Sumatran dhole is the smallest dhole subspecies. It has bright red fur. The Sumatran dhole lacks woolly underfur. Instead, it has a darker coarse and leaner fur, similar to the southernmost populations of Ussuri dholes in India and Indochina; however, it has more black on the back.Mivart, G. (1890), Dogs, Jackals, Wolves and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canid√¶, London : R.H. Porter : Dulau, pp. 177‚Äì88 Range and habitat The Sumatran dhole range is highly fragmented and Indonesian dholes are confirmed to live in multiple protected areas of Sumatra and Java. In 2014, camera trap videos in the tropical forests of the Kerinci Seblat National Park in Sumatra revealed the continued presence of dholes in the area. Dholes are completely extinct in Singapore. Sumatran dholes live in scrublands, grasslands, plains, tropical forests and rainforests. Threats Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to Sumatran dholes living in protected areas in Indonesia, particularly those on Sumatra. Habitat loss is driven by several different factors, including logging, palm and rubber plantations, agriculture expansion, rural biomass extraction, livestock grazing and major infrastructure expansion.

By coincidence and with some accompanying criticism, the network's launch announcement came out around the same time as the San Bernardino shootings occurred. The network mainly operated through a website live stream, along with an overnight over-the-air feed carried by networks such as the American Sports Network's 24/7 service, Tuff TV, Pursuit Channel and FightTV. However, the concept proved to be unsuccessful, and the network ended their operations on January 9, 2017, only nine months after their April 1, 2016 launch. They continued to air hour-long paid programming blocks overnights on Pursuit Channel of a pre-announced model's demonstration after that date until mid- April 2017, when the company's social media accounts went dormant, with its website following soon after. Business model Unlike other shopping channels, Gun TV would not ship any products directly to customers in order to comply with Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations; instead, the customer would pick up their purchase at the nearest federally licensed dealer, which completed the necessary NICS background checks and paperwork. The firearms were shipped to the dealer via Louisiana-based wholesaler Sports South. As it is illegal to fire a weapon inside a studio in California, Gun TV featured inactive weapons and unloaded firearms in the studio, combined with out-of-studio demonstrations of the firearms with former law enforcement and military personnel, along with popular markspersons, such as ex-Olympic shooters and contestants from the History competitive shooting series Top Shot among those showing off the features of the offered weaponry.

History The hunt was founded in 1791 by John Corbet of Sundorne, near Shrewsbury. John Corbet established the Hunt Club at the White Lion Inn, Stratford-upon-Avon, where once a fortnight the club‚Äôs members would meet for a dinner, during the dinner the first toast was always to \\"the King\\" and the second to \\"the blood of the Trojans\\", Trojan being a favourite hound from which most of the hunt‚Äôs hounds descended. During this time, John Corbet hunted almost the entire county of Warwickshire with the hunt. John Corbet kenneled the pack at the White Lion during the hunting season, whilst he would return it to his seat at Sundorne Castle during the summer months. Originally the pack comprised about 70 couples of hounds (140 hounds) and were hunted in two packs, a bitch pack and a dog pack, the bitch pack being preferred by many huntsmen for their quickness of scent, and activity. In 1811, the pack was purchased by Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton for 1200 guineas and he became master of the hunt. Lord Middleton disbanded the Hunt Club at the White Lion and divided the hunt's country with other hunts. During this period, the pack was temporarily kennelled at Kenilworth prior to Lord Middleton building a large range of stables and kennels for the pack in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1821 Evelyn Shirley of Ettington Hall succeeded Lord Middleton as master of the hunt after Lord Middleton suffered a nasty fall from a horse. At this time the hunt started accepting subscriptions and Mr Shirley, who was assisted by the famous huntsman Jack Wood, built a new kennel for the hunt in Butlers Marston. The current Grade II listed kennels in Little Kineton were built in 1839. Between World War I and World War II the Warwickshire Hunt was considered one of the premier hunts in the midland shires, with a succession of famous huntsmen including Bob Champion, Ted Cox and George Gillson. Hunt country Warwickshire Hunt in 1896 The hunt‚Äôs country covers areas of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire and is long and across.

Recognised for his achievements in philosophy and psychology, he was awarded a Nuffield Foundation Travelling Fellowship with the University of London in 1958, and returned there as an Honorary Research Fellow in 1980. Maze's theoretical psychology extended from analyses of psychoanalytic metapsychology, to critique of concerns of psychology research of the day, including concepts of attitude, motivation, psychological homeostasis, psychological variables and social constructionism. Drawing on processes of conceptual and logical analysis, Maze sought to draw out logical inconsistencies and conceptual confusions apparent in theoretical psychological discourse. It is the logical structure of his theory and conclusions, as a function of a long connection with Andersonian realism which renders Maze's contribution as unique in theoretical psychology.  Biography   Early life  John Maze was born in 1923, one of five children. His father, John William Maze, was born into a Protestant family in Northern Ireland in 1868; their mother was born Hannah Victoria Sherwin in Derby, England in 1887. They migrated independently to Australia as young adults before the First World War, met in Sydney and were married there. Maze's father was a member of the New South Wales police force, and Maze's mother died when he was aged 14. Serving in the Australian Military Forces during World War II, Maze was recruited to Intelligence, and was on a boat heading to New Guinea, when the atom bomb was dropped in the Pacific. On return home, Maze took the opportunity to go to university as offered to returned soldiers who could read and write, graduating with double first class honours in both psychology and philosophy.  Later career  On completing his studies, Maze was appointed in Sydney University's Department of Psychology by Professor William O‚ÄôNeil in 1952, and his master's degree was presented in 1954. Maze received a Nuffield scholarship in London in 1958. Maze worked in the Department of Psychology at Sydney University for more than 34 years. Maze's papers were published in journals such as Psychological Review, the International Journal of Psychoanalysis, the International Review of Psychoanalysis, Theory and Psychology, and fall into four categories or themes.  Ideas   Situational realism and psychoanalysis  Two relatively diverse currents of critical thinking shaped Maze's intellectual development. John Anderson, Challis Professor of Philosophy at Sydney University (1927 to 1958) had a substantial impact on students and on Maze, with a systematic philosophical approach grounded in realism, empiricism and pluralism (Baker, 1979). Anderson's systematic realism states that reality is composed of situations of irreducible and infinite complexity that occur in time and space (Passmore, 1962), which are circumscribed by the conditions of discourse (Maze, 1983). Logic is taken as the fundamental basis of knowledge (Baker, 1986), and it is Anderson's rigorous logical approach that is clearly reflected in Maze's writing on psychology and psychoanalysis (Henry, 2009). The psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic technique of Sigmund Freud provided both content and structure on and by which Maze's materials and methods grew. In respect to content, Maze refined a view of psychology as ‚Äúthe study of how cognition shapes behaviour in the service of the instinctual drives‚Äù (Michell, 1988, p. 228), developing a theory of drives that suggested that biological instinct must underpin any form of later object-relation, reconciling a biological bases to observable psychological phenomena (or, at his historical moment, behaviour) without postulating unnecessary intervening variables or representations (Henry, 2009). In regards to structure, the psychoanalytic procedure of consistently returning to first principles in an effort to draw out any hidden or unconscious elements is reflected in Maze's writings on later paradigms relevant to psychology, including social constructionism, the information-processing approach of the cognitivists, and other forms of representationism (Turtle, 1997)  Concept of motivation  Against the behaviourism and the cognitivism of the time which looked for universal regularities in human psychology, Maze drew on Freud's theory that attributed primacy and determinism to the biological bases of drives in setting out a framework for individual differences in behavior and cognition, an approach that also was employed to set a foundation for human motivation (Boag, 2008). In regards to the cognitive representationism inherent within ego psychology and object relations theory which implies that internal representations of self must exist as objects, Maze worked to identify logical incoherence in these accounts insofar as the internal representations could only be qualified by the behavior or phenomena they produced. These internal representations then cannot be considered to exist as independent objects at risk of the logical fallacy of reification (Boag, 2007). The challenge to simplistic descriptions in psychology presented by Maze extended to critique of purposivist accounts of psychological homeostasis (1953/2009) and the logically plausible foundations of a concept of attitude (1973/2009).  Epistemology and the nature of cognition  At a time where the information processing approach to philosophy of mind dominated (see particularly Fodor, 1981), Maze presented a critique of the same as a logical fallacy, insofar as such accounts imply that it is only possible to know about events through internal processing of internal relations, without any reference to the independent entities or events in the real world that are said to be represented (Maze, 1991/2009). The critique highlights a central theme occurring throughout Maze's work, which is the rejection of any implication of constitutive relations. The rejection of constitutive relations is also evidenced in the critique of the relativism of social constructionism (Maze 2001/2009). Such an account leaves the concept of knowledge so constructed lost in circularity, without any point of reference to the external world. Maze also suggests that there is sterility in any approach that attempts to falsely reduce psychological processes down to simples ‚Äì for example the theory within cognitive science that suggests perceptions is built up from a layering of sensory particulars to arrive at kinds (Henry, 2009). Maze's adoption of Anderson's situational realism rather suggests an irreducible complexity to each situation, where situations may be understood to be nested, and remain infinitely complex, in structure.  Psychoanalytic metatheory  Maze questioned whether the existence of values, goals, a need for love and understanding, choices, actions, drives and desire for meaning or knowledge could be considered to be inherent within the individual or ‚Äúa constituent or characteristic of the organism‚Äù (Maze, 1952/2009, p. 25). Such concepts are taken on principle at face value as constituents in object relations theory, but critique in the form of the error of reification is suggested by Maze to render such approaches as logically incoherent. Maze (1993/2009) suggests that object relations theory is complemented by drive-instinct theory, because drive-instinct theory offers a basis for explanations about why particular objects are sought out. The notion of Freud's theory as a ‚Äòone-person psychology‚Äô as developed by later theorists who presented such theories as object relations theory as ‚Äòtwo-person psychology‚Äô is questioned by Maze, because drive-instinct theory never precluded and in some respects relied on the very existence of a second person in its original formulation of instincts or drives.  Application of psychoanalysis to literature and history  In Fyodor Dostoevsky and Virginia Woolf Maze selected authors who were sceptical analysts of the realm of human motivation and conventional morality, qualities resonant with his own endeavours. The entire corpus of Virginia Woolf's work was subject of the 1997 monograph 'Virginia Woolf; Feminism, Creativity, and the Unconscious', where Maze used psychoanalytic technique to draw together otherwise unrelated parts of the text to reveal chains of associations and something about the nature of the unconscious. Maze also collaborated with Graham White on two psychohistorical projects, with books on two prominent politicians from Roosevelt's New Deal Cabinet. At the age of 80 he set himself to write five novels, a fantasy fiction series for young adults surrounding the adventures of Cassandra Peel. The novels present in language suitable for young audiences the Greek deities, their fervours and foments, using everyday characters and aspects of everyday life.

Paper Boat was launched by Hector Beverages in August 2013. The product consists of a range of traditional, indigenous Indian drinks such as Aam Panna, Jaljeera and Aam Ras. The drinks were initially offered in single serving, flexible pouches; the company has since then expanded to one liter Tetra Pak cartons as well. The company aims to preserve traditional recipes while using innovation to make the ethnic Indian drinks accessible to an urban market. Paper Boat does not use artificial coloring or preservatives in its products. The company is funded by N.R. Narayana Murthy-led Catamaran Ventures, Footprint Ventures and Sequoia Capital, among other investors. History Hector Beverages was founded in 2009 by Neeraj Kakkar, Neeraj Biyani, Suhas Misra and James Nuttall. The company's first product was a protein drink called Frissia, following which the energy drink brand, Tzinga was launched in 2011. In March 2013, the company launched Paper Boat, a fruit pulp based beverage brand and shifted its focus to the ethnic drinks segment. The Paper Boat brand aimed to bring back traditional drinks of India into the modern context. The idea for the brand is said to have taken birth during one of the office lunch that the co-founders would have together in the early years. Mishra's mother would pack him a flask of Aam Panna everyday and once while reaching out for the drink, as they were mulling over business ideas, a brain wave to commercially produce ethnic Indian drinks that were hitherto unavailable in the market struck. And the idea for Paper Boat was born. The brand launched with Aam Panna and Jal Jeera drinks and later added a wide range of ethnic drinks to its portfolio including Aam Ras, Chilled Rasam, Kokum, Jamun Kala Khatta, Chilli Gauva and Neer More. The company went through a few organizational changes when co-founders Misra and Nuttall left the company in 2014 and 2015, respectively, leaving Kakkar and Biyani at the helm. In 2016, in a bid to increase in house consumption of the brand, Paper Boat launched 500 ml Tetra Prisma Aseptic (TPA) packs of its two most popular drinks, Aam Ras and Anar. The 500 ml packs were discontinued in 2017, when the brand expanded its offering by launching its drinks in 1 liter Tetra Prisma Aseptic cartons. This move widened the brand's reach to the multi-serve category. Paper Boat expanded to the traditional food segment in 2016 by launching the Indian snack, peanut chikki. and books Sticking to the core brand philosophy, Paper Boat foods aims to provide ethnic Indian snacks in contemporary, modern packaging. Paper Boat recently tied up with Accenture to increase its offerings of different authentic tastes in 2020.  Products  Paper Boat offers a range of fruit based ethnic drinks such as Jal Jeera, Aam Panna, Aam Ras, Alphonso Aam, Jamun Kala Khatta, Chilli Guava, Nimbu Pani, Kokum, Neer More, Kanji, Sugarcane juice, Lychee Ras, Apple and Orange. It also has a range of milk based beverages including Neer More, Butter Milk, Badam Milk and Thandai. The brand also launched Coconut Water in 2018. Apart from these, Paper Boat produces two seasonal drinks associated with Indian festivals, Panakam (available during Ram Navami) and Sherbet-e-Khas (available during Eid). In its one-liter Tetra Pack cartons the brand delivers Aam Ras, Jamun, Anar, Apple, Guava, Mixed Fruit, Pineapple, Cranberry, Tomato and Lychee Ras. The drinks are manufactured in ultra hygienic production facilities and do not contain preservatives or artificial coloring. Aam Ras, one of the brand's most popular drinks, contains 45% mango pulp and is made from naturally ripened mangoes. Peanut chikki was Paper Boat's first venture into ethic Indian snacks. Paper Boat chikki is a Fair-Trade product, a certification that ensures that everyone involved in the making of a product is fairly employed and paid. The company procures its groundnuts directly from a farmers‚Äô collective near Rajkot in Gujarat at the Fairtrade minimum price. Paper Boat chikki has three other variants: crushed peanut, sesame and Rajgira peanut. Following the launch of chikki, the brand has also launched a range of ethnic Indian foods including Banana Chips, Aam Papad, Bakarwadi, Namak Para, Gur Para and Shakar Para. Production Hector Beverages presently has two manufacturing facilities, one in Mysuru and one in Manesar, Gurgaon, and can produce up to ten million of the pouches per month. The company's first production plant was established in Manesar in 2010. However, with increase in demand, the Manesar plant couldn't keep up the production. The plant also did not have the facilities for the manufacture of coconut water and sugar cane juice, drinks that the company was looking to launch. This led them to set up a second, larger manufacturing unit in Mysuru, Karnataka in 2014. While the Manesar plant has a production capacity of 80 bottles per minute, in the Mysuru plant, it is 380 bottles per minute. Marketing As a brand based on age-old recipes and memories, Paper Boat's marketing strategy revolves around nostalgia, childhood and innocence. The brand name Paper Boat and the tag line, ‚ÄòDrinks and Memories‚Äô is aimed at re-connecting the consumers to their childhood. Paper Boat's beverages such as Aam Panna and Jal Jeera are drinks that their consumers grew up drinking and carry a strong association with their childhood. The brand's campaigns try to evoke those childhood memories and remind their consumers of their innocence. Paper Boat's television advertising campaign consisted of a series of simple, evocative ads that reflected the brand idea of childhood nostalgia. The ads were set to an adaptation of the music of RK Narayan‚Äôs iconic Malgudi Days. Paper Boat‚Äôs debut campaign was penned and narrated by renowned poet and lyricist Gulzar, while the later campaign was written by lyricist Swanand Kirkire. Apart from its television ads, the brand has also released a range short films celebrating childhood memories and nostalgia. ‚ÄòRide Down the River of Memories‚Äô, ‚ÄòWaiting for Ma‚Äô, ‚ÄòMy Struggles with the Treasure Chest‚Äô and ‚ÄòHum honge kamyab‚Äô ‚Äì are all short films aimed at bringing out the child in everyone. In 2016, Paper Boat released 'Rizwan - Keeper of the Gates of Heaven,' a 3.30 minute film created by the creative agency, Humour Me. The film narrates the story of an old man named Rizwan who reminisces about his childhood and is a celebration of innocence, bravery and love. The video used animation, narration and strong characterization to tell a moving tale. Paper Boat has a strong presence on social media with compelling digital marketing campaigns. It has over 340K following on Facebook and 18.8 K followers on Instagram. While its Facebook campaign showcases illustrations celebrating childhood memories, the brand's Instagram page uses doodles, visual stories and creative projects to tell the Paper Boat story. As an extension of its marketing campaign, Paper Boat has also ventured into book publishing. It has published reprints of the classics, Three Men in a Boat and Jungle Book, which were given away with the beverages as part of gift boxes and sales offers. In 2017, the brand published Half Pants Full Pants by Anand Suspi, a collection of real-life tales about growing up in Shimoga.

Though a ban on female Shinto priests was lifted during World War II, the number of women priests in Shinto is a small fraction of contemporary clergy. History of women in Shinto Women in Shinto often appear as miko, shrine maidens who are consistently seen as conduits between spirits and men, though men are then seen as the actors who implement the will of the spirit. The Mythological beginnings The diverse roles of women in Shinto myths make it difficult for scholars to generalize about women's roles at Shinto's origin. Amateratsu, the sun goddess, and Himiko, an early shaman queen of Japan, are central figures in the faith. Other goddesses include Benten, a dragon-woman of good luck, and Inari, a rice goddess who takes the form of kitsune, a vixen (female fox) at many Shinto shrines. The Kojiki, a collection of stories which form Shinto practices, purport to be collected from a courtesan, Hieda no Are, and written down at the request of an Empress, Gemmei. In the earliest records of Shinto, from the 2nd to 7th centuries, women were valued as representatives, and carriers, of fertility. There is debate among scholars as to the extent of which this translated into political power within society or within Shinto practice, with some evidence suggesting a deferential tendency to women from male counterparts. Some scholars suggest that priesthood at this time was seen as a dual role shared by men and women, operating together, often as brother and sister. Female Royal High Priests at Ise shrine According to the mythology of Japan described in the Nihon Shoki, nieces or daughters of the Emperor or Empress served as intermediaries at one of Shinto's holiest sites, the Ise shrine, beginning in the 7th century. These female priests served to connect the reigning Emperor to the purported divine origin of that Emperor's power, and remained an official position until the 14th century. They retreated to the Royal Palace for a year after being chosen, followed by another year in seclusion, before moving to the Shrine at Ise, where they participated in, and watched over, purification rituals for about 11 years. Once retired, they could marry. The Heian era Kamo shrine, Kyoto The Heian era saw an early synthesis of Buddhist and Shinto beliefs in Japan, and the integration of a Confucian legal system from China. The introduction of a more patriarchal confucianist social structure, resulted in a decline in power for female shamans and female shrine priests. For example, women no longer had any claim to official positions at shrines, and miko were limited to maintenance and upkeep. Some scholars suggest that, while spiritual power was considered equal among male and female priests in this time period, male priests nonetheless wielded larger influence and political power. Others suggest that the role of ancient women as priests in Shinto is a contemporary myth without connection to ancient Shinto practice. Female priests at Ise shrine maintained their role during this period, and were complemented by a similar position at the Kamo shrine in Kyoto. Like those at Ise, those at Kamo served one year at the Imperial Palace before overseeing the shrine's activities. These priests would also perform rituals and purifications, including fasting and overseeing ceremonies. Tokugawa and Meiji era During the Tokugawa shogunate, all Shinto priests were consolidated under the control of the Yoshida family, which limited the power of female priests. The Meiji era sought to regulate Shinto practices; as part of this, female Shinto priests were largely pushed out of their positions in 1868. In this period, a nationalist movement (was not a nationalist movement, many rejected a lot of rules in this era which let to secret nationalist societies like the black dragon society) toward modernization called for the elimination of magical elements that had come to be most closely associated with women. This trend continued until the defeat of Imperial Japan. After the defeat of Imperial Japan, Shinto and the state were rendered legally distinct, with prohibitions on state involvement, and later, women were again permitted to become priests. Shinto taboos applicable to women Exclusion from sacred sites Sign announcing the prohibition of women climbers The Japanese government issued an edict (May 4, 1872, Grand Council of State Edict 98) stating, \\"Any remaining practices of female exclusion on shrine and temple lands shall be immediately abolished, and mountain climbing for the purpose of worship, etc., shall be permitted\\". However, women in Japan today do not have complete access to all such places.\\"Envisioning and Observing Women's Exclusion from Sacred Mountains in Japan\\", Dewitt, Lindsey E., Journal of Asian Humanities at Kyushu University. 1, pp.19-28, 2016-03. For example, a sign at a World Heritage site associated with Shintoism, Mt. Omine in Nara, forbids women from climbing to the top, which has triggered a number of controversial protests. Some Shinto shrines also ask recent mothers not to pass through torii gates to enter for 72 days after childbirth. Also, women in Japan were forbidden from participation in Yamakasa, parades in which Shinto shrines are carried through a town, until 2001. Some historians suggest that the practice of excluding women may have originated from folk tales about women who were turned to stone or brought on natural disasters as they approached sacred sites on mountains, or owing to the choice of religious ascetics that rejected interactions with women, and commonly lived high in the mountains. Others suggest the prohibition is influenced by Buddhist doctrine against sexual relationships between monks and nuns. Blood pollution Women's menstrual blood is a taboo in Shinto, thought to be influenced by the popularity of the Buddhist . This doctrine preached that women were condemned to a Blood Bowl Sutra hell for the sin of pollution through menstrual blood; only the prayer could spare them. Though Buddhist in origin, Shinto facilities emulated this practice in their teaching, encouraging women, and men who had contact with menstrual women, to avoid shrines. Women Shinto priests In Shinto, female priests are allowed, but remain rare, and take on the male role of priests from recent history, more so than the traditional Shamanistic role of women in early Shinto. More common roles for women in the clergy are miko, shrine stewards who assist the chief priest. Outside of organized Shinto, however, an increasing number of women are taking the title \\"miko\\" and tying it to original Shinto practices such as fortune-telling and healing arts. Though 20 women per year graduate from Kokugakuin University with credentials for priesthood, less than two per year become clergy. In 2001, the Association of Shinto Shrines estimated that there were fewer than 25 women priests in Tokyo. A ban on female priests was lifted during World War Two, reflecting smaller family sizes and a shrinking interest in religion within Japan, as well as a labor shortage after the war. Most of the first women priests were the wives or daughters of priests who went to war. These women were typically preferred over new priests, because they were well versed in their husband‚Äôs duties, and already integrated into the community. Special considerations for women priests Some female Shinto priests assert that Shinto is no different from other religions in its treatment of women. Akiko Kobayashi, a woman who was then a priest for more than 20 years, stated that there is \\"no opposition\\" from either male priests or those who attend shrines led by women priests. Menstruation poses a unique challenge to women priests in Shinto, which considers menstrual blood a defilement of sacred spaces. This \\"red uncleanness\\" (aka fujo, in Japanese) was invoked as a traditional restriction on women‚Äôs participation in sacred space. In the modern era, menstrual periods in Shinto priests are controlled through the use of medication. Some of the most important shrines in National Shinto sects, Ise and Atsuta, continue to limit the participation of women priests. Other obstacles to female priesthood in Shinto include the patronage system, in which an elder priest serves as a mentor for a new priest during religious instruction. This patronage system forbids male priests from instructing women. With a majority of Shinto priests being men, this can pose a challenge for aspiring female priests to find elder mentors. Notable women Shinto priests Mihoko Ishii became the priest of Suwa Shrine in Nambu, Aomori Prefecture, after the death of her husband, who had been chief priest. Yuri Kawasaki became in 2008 the first female Shinto priest ever to serve at Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´. Nobuyo Otagaki, a female Shinto priest at Amagasaki Ebisu Shrine, in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Otagaki, the daughter of a Shinto priest, was a graduate of Ritsumeikan University. After taking on work as a flight attendant, Otagaki began to study Shinto and became certified into priesthood. After moving to New York for two years, she returned to Amagasaki to become a resident priest in 2008. She took over the Chief Priesthood position from her father in 2012. Women in folk Shinto In popular, localized traditions influenced by, but not officially recognized as, Shinto practice, there is a common figure of itako, or ichiko, or ogamisama: blind mediums. These shamans are always women who enter the calling prior to menstruation. Evidence shows some common aspects of initiation practices for these women among schools in Yamagata, Aomori, and Miyagi prefectures in the 1920s and 1930s. They are trained in various practices, including memorization of Shinto and Buddhist prayers and sutras. Training typically involved cold- water mizugori, or purifying baths, which in its most extreme form can involve complete, sustained drenching by ice-cold water for a period of several days. Once named an itako or ichiko, the woman serves as an intermediary for kami and deceased spirits.

The park encompasses an area of on the southeast coast of Russia's Far East in the federal district Primorsky Krai (in English, \\"Maritime Region\\"). The park is about 100 km northeast of Vladivostok, on both the eastern and western slopes of the southern Sikhote-Alin mountain range, a range that runs north-south through the Primorsky Krai. The relatively warm waters of the Sea of Japan are to the east, the Korean peninsula to the south, and China to the West. The terrain in rugged and difficult to access, with heavily forested taiga coexisting with tropical species of animals and birds. The park is relatively isolated from human development, and functions as a conservation reserve. Tourists may visit the portions of the park marked for recreation, but entry to the protected zones is only possible in the company of park rangers. Topography The southern end of the Primorsky maritime province was not glaciated in the most recent ice age, creating conditions for high levels of biodiversity. Zov Tigra occupies the highlands at the southern end of the region, on the ridge of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. The Milogradovik River flows from the area south to the Sea of Japan, some 50 miles to the south. Flowing to the north, tributaries of the Ussuri River make their way to the Amur River basin. These rivers drop quickly in narrow canyons with rapids known for sudden floods in the Spring rainy season. The mountains are rugged and isolated. Only a few former logging roads approach the park, and access is difficult even during the summer. The park's website notes that a logging road that appears on maps to the north is in fact often not passable, even with off-road vehicles. The mountains are medium in height, with the highest point being Mt. Cloud at 1,854 meters above sea level, and the lowest point in the river valley of 155 meters. There are 56 peaks over 1,000 meters in height. On the upper Ussuri/Milogradovka is a large peatland measuring 4‚Äì6 km by 1.5‚Äì2 km (Yaklanov, p. 10), Primorye's highest bog. Climate The climate of Zov Tigra is Humid continental, warm summer subtype Humid Continental (Koppen classification Dwb). This climate is characterized by large daily and annual swings in temperature, and precipitation spread throughout the year with snow in winter. The average temperature is -17 degrees (C) in the Winter and warms to 30 C in the July August. The northern part of the park, which includes the beginnings of the Ussuri River) is significantly colder than the southern part - 0.4 degrees (C) on average, versus the milder 2.4 degree (C) of the south. The northern sections also have less annual precipitation (539 mm) than the south (764 mm). On forested slopes, the typical snowfall in Winter is about 50 cm. Autumn in the region is clear, warm, dry and with gradually declining temperatures. This has been called the \\"golden Far East Autumn.\\" Ecoregion Zov Tigra is in the Ussuri broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion, which covers mountainous areas above the lower Amur River and Ussuri River. Such ecoregions are characterized by wide daily and annual variations in temperature, and a forest cover. Zov Tigra NP to the Northeast, Lazovsky Nature Reserve to the Southwest The park is situated in a way that maximizes plant and animal diversity. It is at multiple meeting points: the meeting of continental and maritime zones (Eurasia and the Pacific Ocean) and the meeting of hot and cold-loving species from both temperate and sub-tropic zones (being on the 45 degree latitude line, the park is halfway between the North and South Pole). It is also a geological contact region between ancient (Achean-Proterozoic) stable base rocks to the west, and more active tectonic formations to the east in the Sea of Japan. Furthermore, it is on major migration routes of birds and other animals, and has a topography that escaped both recent glaciation and human development. The resulting diversity of habitats and isolation gives the Primorsky region the highest levels of biodiversity in Russia. Plants Elevation differentials between mountain peak and valley floor can exceed 1,200 meters, displaying zones of vegetation based altitude. The lowest zone, below 600 meters in the valleys and lower slopes, is a mixed forest of coniferous and broad-leafed trees. In the southern, milder areas of the park are belts of oak forest, and associated vegetation, that shows the effects of former selective logging (foot-based) and forest fires. There are no oaks in the northern, colder reaches. From 600 meters to 1100 meters is a belt of fir- spruce forests, with the trees often covered with coniferous epiphytic mosses and lichens. Above 1100 meters is a zone of subalpine shrubs and firs. A zone of alpine meadows and flowers leads to bare areas at the highest peaks. Aside from these main zones, there are smaller groups of plant communities, including stands of larch forest where pine-spruce or cedar-broadleaf stands have been cleared by fire or past logging; these temporary larch communities will be succeeded by pine-deciduous and pine-spruce.

In addition to the altitude zones, at any given spot the temperate forests typically have four levels above ground: a canopy of the dominant species of tree, a slightly lower layer of mature trees, a shrub layer, and an understory of grasses. Over 2,500 different species of plants have been recorded in the Primorsky region, with many of them found in Zov Tigra. In the Red Book of rare and vulnerable species of the Primorsky region, there are 343 species of vulnerable plants and 55 species of fungi. Animals Zov tigra was established in part to act as a \\"source habitat\\" for the recovery of the Amur Tiger and its prey base. A survey in 2012 identified four Amur tigers resident in the park, and four more visiting the protected areas frequently. The base of prey (mostly ungulates) was steady, with a census of over 1,200 Manchurian deer, 800 Roe deer, and 99 Sika deer and 189 wild boars. These species make up some 85% of the Amur tiger's diet. Tigers are known as an \\"umbrella species\\" for conservation: their success in a region indicates that the species below them are in a healthy balance. File:Tiger-zoologie.de0001 22.JPG|Amur Tiger File:Cervus elaphus xanthopygus.JPG|Manchurian Deer File:Bengalkatze.jpg|Far Eastern Forest Cat Brown bears are common in area; with a density estimated by the park administration as 0.4-0.5 per 10 km2. Lynx are found at approximately the same density. The Far Eastern Forest Cat is found in the broad-leaf and oak valleys. The critically endangered Amur Leopard has not been resident since the 1970s, but there are hopes that the growing protection level of Zov Tigra will support a return. The three main threats to the animals of Zov Tigra are poaching, forest fires, and (historically) logging. Park management, working with conservation organizations, have stepped up anti-poaching patrols and enforcement. History There are many archaeological sites of fortified towns and villages near the border of the park, dating to the 12th-century Jurchen Empire. These sites have not been systematically investigated. In 2014, the administration of Zov Tigra National Park was consolidated with the 120,000 hectare Lazovsky Nature Reserve to the south. The Lazovsky Reserve extends protected coverage to the south, and is also a known habitat for Amur tigers. (There is a small area between the two that is managed by a private hunting club). Tourism To visit the park, you must submit an application in advance. Tours of the main sights are conducted in the presence of park rangers. There are fees for services such as transportation in the park, guides, and use of guest quarters or campsites. The park is primarily oriented towards the protection of vulnerable species. The areas open to recreation tend to be narrow corridors to the main attractions, such as waterfalls and mountain peaks, but are still difficult to reach and not well developed with facilities. In 2015, due to forest fire danger, the park was temporarily closed to citizens.

Biography Johnson was born on November 29, 1813 in Buckland, Massachusetts. The eighth child (of thirteen children) and second son of Capt. Othniel and Anna (Elmer) Johnson. On October 24, 1838, Johnson married Abigail Clark (1812-1889). They would have six children between 1841 and 1849 (five of whom reached adulthood). On May 17, 1842 he and his family settled in the territory of Wisconsin (Greenfield). William Wallace Johnson was a school board member (1842-1848) and a teacher in the Greenfield township and contructed with his own hands the Honey Creek School in 1843 and the Johnson School in 1847. He also served as Town Treasurer (1847-1848) and Town Clerk (1848-1855). In 1859, he was ordained a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Also, from 1849 to 1900 he was Secretary of Honey Creek Cemetery Association. Johnson died on September 6, 1900 in Greenfield, Wisconsin and he is buried in Honey Creek Cemetery in West Allis, Wisconsin.

History In July 1895, President Horace Bumstead of Atlanta University proposed a plan to the board of trustees to conduct yearly studies on the transition of Negroes from their time in slavery to their transition into freedom.Wright 2002 The findings and research was to be presented at conferences that were to be held yearly entitled Atlanta Conferences. Bradford's and Bumstead's original plan was to hold conferences and present general social problems faced by African-Americans in major cities (Wright 2002). Bradford and Bumstead got the idea to hold conferences from other institutions such as Hampton University and Tuskegee University (Wright, 2002). According to president Bumstead,‚ÄúWe are simply to study human life under certain conditions- conditions which, if repeated with any other race, would have practically the same result‚Äù.Chase, 1896 pp. 5-6 He considered that the employments of city Negroes are different from those of their rural brethren, agriculture being replaced by trade, or the various form of personal service, and to some extent by mercantile and professional pursuits. Their social life is also different‚Äù.Chase, 1896 pg. 5 Another reason Bumstead wanted to study Negroes was because he thought that their problems and living conditions received little attention (Chase, 1896 pg. 5). He wanted to know how Negroes were able to establish themselves in cities on their own and thought it was good that graduates were a part of that. Once the proposal was approved it was decided that the first study was the Mortality among Negroes in Cities. Bumstead and trustee George Bradford were in charge of the studies. During this study Bumstead and Bradford wanted to study not just the African Americans but the country as a whole including Whites. His findings indicated that there was an alarming increase in the death of the Negro population of cities and large towns from problems of drunkenness, ignorance, poverty, and neglect.Chase 1896. 51 The second study conducted was the Social and Physical Condition of Negroes. It was intended to find out how and why the mortality rates of Negroes were so high. Statistical research was found and the study was executed by three colored graduate students. The findings indicate that conditions of Negroes needed to improve in order for the Negroes to have a stable life. In 1896, William Edward Burghardt DuBois, was offered a position to teach history and political science at Atlanta University. DuBois had intentions when he accepted the position at Atlanta University; for example, he wanted to expand the boundaries of sociological analysis, document the Negroes, and assist in training fellow black intellectual elites at Atlanta University.Reed, 1997 p 44 It was important to DuBois that blacks becomes elites and help their communities because it was better for the advancement of the race if Negroes were educated. W.E.B DuBois accepted the position and started in 1897. DuBois was considered for the position because of his own independent studies of Negroes in the US. Before he arrived, two studies were already conducted under the direction of Bumstead and Bradford. DuBois thought that the way in which the studies were conducted had room to improve. DuBois officially arrived in 1897 and immediately wanted to take charge of the studies of Negroes as well. He wanted to take charge of the studies because he felt that they were not gathering and using the data correctly. He indicated that, ‚Äúas a scientific accomplish the first conference was not important.DuBois, 1940, 1965, p.797 Soon after taking charge, he developed a new plan and indicated, ‚ÄúWhen I took charge of the Atlanta Conference, I did not pause to consider how far my developed plans agreed or disagreed with the ideas of the already launched project. It made an essential difference, since only one conference been held and the second planned.DuBois 1968 DuBois' original plan for the Atlanta Conferences was to present a single African- American issue each year and not combine general findings yearly. DuBois planned to create a program that lasted for 100 (look at DuBois 1968 p 215 to get specifics on how he planned studies) years worth of studies in 10-year increments. DuBois began conducting studies and presented them yearly at the Atlanta Conferences. DuBois believe that social problems among Negroes would be better understood by approaching the studies inductively. Methods in which were used to collect the data was the systematic method triangulation (social science). Methodical triangulation (social science) was the method executed to create more precise social facts by using multiple forms and sources of data. DuBois, students and colleagues used participant observation, surveyed individuals, historical research, and census data to get more accurate results.Wright 2002, Wright, 2010 The Atlanta Sociological Laboratory was the first university department to exercise method and theory triangulation, and the first to use insider researchers (Wright 2010). As time went on, DuBois made sure he increased the awareness of the conditions in which Negroes endured. He also noticedng that his findings of Negro studies was starting to impact the nation in a positive way. According to DuBois, ‚Äú. . . the kindergarten system of the city of Atlanta, white as well as black; the Negro Business League, and various projects to better health and combat crime‚Äù were all inspired by DuBois's work. DuBois continued to work with the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory for 13 years and resigned in 1910, but remained a director of Atlanta Conference publication until 1914.DuBois 1968, Wright 2002 After DuBois left Atlanta University, he was still a very active participant in the Atlanta conferences until the final publication in 1917. 1924 was the last year of the Atlanta Conferences. DuBois reasons for resigning included lack of advertising on his behalf, ‚ÄúEither I myself or someone for me should have called public attention to what had been done or otherwise it would quickly forgotten. Indeed the philosophy then current and afterwards triumphant was that the Deed without Advertising was worthless and in the long run Advertising without the Deed was the only lasting value‚Äù.DuBois 1968; Wright 2002 DuBois faced great adversary while conducting the Negro studies that lead to his resignation, for example funding became an issue because of there was a lack of support that came from the state of Georgia to Atlanta University. There became a lack of support for Negro studies because Atlanta University was refusing to accept funds from the state of Georgia in exchange that they end the Negro studies. Because Atlanta University did not accept funds, it led to the deterioration of the Atlanta Conferences of which the last publication was in 1917 (Wright 2002). ‚ÄúAccording to DuBois, had Atlanta University accepted funding from the state of Georgia it would have been forced to succumb to the racial intolerance that contradicted the original charter of the university, but the school would not have experienced the level of financial crisis it was later troubled by.DuBois, 1968, Wright 2002 Because of the racial tensions in the South during the time in which DuBois lived, it was hard to get information about minorities without disrupting Jim Crow laws. Of the lesser known members who made important contributions to the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory, Monroe Nathan Work, a graduate from the University of Chicago department of Sociology, whose work was influenced by DuBois‚Äôs studies at Atlanta University that he began working with the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory conducting research and having it appear in Atlanta University Publications. Work‚Äôs contributions to the Atlanta University Publications include reports on religion and crime that were published in the 1903 and 1904 monographs and a 1917 offering on economic cooperation‚Äù.Wright II, 2010 Lucy Craft Laney graduated from Atlanta University in 1873. After Laney graduated from Atlanta University, she became a teacher and opened up her own school in 1886. She opened her own school to teach Negroes based on the curriculum on literature, social sciences and the classics.Wright II 2010 Laney, thought like DuBois and thought Blacks should obtain a liberal arts degree and not get technical or vocational degree like Booker T. Washington theory for Negroes. Laney was known to have participated in at least five Atlanta Conferences. Quotes by DuBois include ‚ÄúSo far as the American world of science and letters as concerned, we never ‚Äúbelonged‚Äù; we remained unrecognized in learned societies and academic groups. We rated merely as Negroes studying Negroes, and after all, what had Negroes to do with America or science.Ashgate Research Companion to Black Sociology ‚ÄúWe are simply to study human life under certain conditions- conditions which, if repeated with any other race, would have practically the same result‚Äù.

The ship was propelled by two four-cylinder vertical compound steam engines, rated at , fed by steam from four cylindrical boilers. This gave a speed of . The ship had a single mast and funnel. The mast differed slightly from the one in its sister Independencia. As designed, its main battery had two 240mm Krupp guns (one at the bow and the other at the stern) on Vavasseur mountings protected with armoured shields, and two quick- firing 120mm Elswick guns on each side. The secondary battery had four 47 mm quick-firing Nordenfelt/Hotchkiss guns, and two 25mm Nordenfelt guns.  History  In July 1889, the Argentine Naval Commission in London signed a contract with the shipyard Cammell Laird of Birkenhead ordering the construction of \\"two twin-shaft, ram-equipped battleships for riverine service\\" (Spanish: dos acorazados de espol√≥n de doble h√©lice para servicio de r√≠os) at a unit cost of ¬£ 176.000; this transaction was approved in September of that year by the Ministry. The first ship, then known as Nueve de Julio and later renamed Libertad when a new cruiser was assigned that name, started construction in 1890 and was launched in 1892; its construction was completed that year. After finalizing trials, in November 1892 the ship was formally accepted by the Argentine Navy, under command of Captain Atilio Barilari. It departed Liverpool on December 20, 1892 and arrived at Buenos Aires on January 25, 1893. Side and top views of ARA Libertad in Brassey‚Äôs 1899 edition In mid-1894 the ship participated in the naval exercises as part of the 1st Division; later that year it joined its sister ship, Independencia, and the battleship Almirante Brown. In 1905 it was assigned to the hydrographic survey of the R√≠o de la Plata (English: River Plate); after that it was reassigned to the Training Division. In 1914, Libertad was assigned to train the crews for the new dreadnought battleships being built in the United States (Rivadavia and Moreno). In 1915 the ship was reclassified as a \\"coast guard ship\\". In 1918‚Äì19 Libertad was maintained in reserve, and by 1922‚Äì23 was assigned as training ship. In 1924-25 the ship was again in reserve, being upgraded to use oil fuel rather than coal. In 1927 Libertad was reclassified as a gunboat, and was assigned to the Gunboat Division in 1930. In December 1946 Libertad was discharged from the Argentine Navy (decree 22.556) and in 1947 transferred to the Coast Guard, to be used as station ship for pilots in the River Plate.

The symbol has a \\"TAB\\" monogram, the first three letters of Cabuyao's old name. It is seen in branding iron for livestock branding. Seal until 1992 From an undetermined point in history until 1992, the town of Cabuyao used a seal which features a church bell. The bell represents a Golden Church bell which is deemed an inseparable part of the town's history and serves as a reminder to its denizens. The design was the outcome of a seal designing competition during the administration of Councilor Carlito Alegre and his colleagues. 1992‚Äì1994 A competition for a new seal for Cabuyao was held. The design of Domingo Alconaba, a native painter of the then town of Cabuyao was chosen. It was adopted as the official seal by the virtue of Municipal Resolution No. 165-1993 which was authored by Municipal Council member, Dionisio S. Punongbayan. Alconaba's design featured the following elements: *The Golden Churchbell ‚Äì or the Kampanang Ginto a historical object of Cabuyao. *Plants ‚Äì represents agriculture *Waves ‚Äì represents Laguna de Bay and marine resources *Two gears ‚Äì represents industry, trade and engineering *Building ‚Äì located in the right portion of the seal which symbolizes commerce of the city. *Little churchbells ‚Äì located on both sides of the text \\"1572\\", the establishment year of Cabuyao, represents the 18 barangays which is part of the locale. Current seal Before cityhood (1994‚Äì2013) from 1994 until Cabuyao became a city, the seal used for the town was different from the one approved by the Office of the President through the National Historical Institute. The current seal which is being used by the City Government of Cabuyao is adapted from the old official seal of the then municipality of Cabuyao which was designed and envisioned by Domingo Alconaba, a native painter of the city. The design was chosen by the then Municipal Government during a seal making competition held in 1993. Through Municipal Resolution No. 070-2011 passed on May 18, 2011 and authored by Municipal Council member Ismael M. Hemedes, it was agreed upon by the Municipal Council of Cabuyao, to use the pre-cityhood seal until Cabuyao officially become a city. 2013‚Äìpresent Through City Resolution No. 2013-402 filed by Hemedes, and agreed upon by the council, the current seal was adopted on August 14, 2013. The seal was revised due to the result of the combined suggestions and ideas by members of the City Council, which they believe aligns to the city's current development at that time. The elements inside the circular band were placed inside a shield. The words \\"SAGISAG NG CABUYAO, LAGUNA\\" was replaced with \\"LUNGSOD NG CABUYAO\\" and \\"1571\\" was relocated to be placed inside the church bell. It was now occupied by \\"2012\\".

The Type 003 will be the first indigenously built Chinese aircraft carrier to feature an integrated electric propulsion system. This will allow the operation of electromagnetic launch catapults.http://www.janes.com/article/75396/china- claims-to-have-developed-conventionally-powered-electromagnetic-catapult The Type 003 configuration would for the first time be \\"catapult-assisted takeoff but arrested recovery\\" (CATOBAR), while the first two carriers were short takeoff barrier arrested recovery (STOBAR). Originally, China's military did not officially confirm the designation of the carrier before it was commissioned. This led the observers to believe that it would be designated as \\"Type 001A\\" and China's third carrier will be designated as \\"Type 002\\". However, upon commissioning of the Shandong as Type 002, observers now believe China's third aircraft carrier class would be designated as Type 003 instead. Owing to the secretive nature of China's aircraft carrier program, information regarding the official naming and designation of the carriers will not be revealed until commissioning. Development Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo of the People's Liberation Army Navy said in 2013 that China's next aircraft carrier would be equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system. Multiple prototypes were spotted by media in 2012, and aircraft capable of electromagnetic launching were tested in Chinese Navy research facilities. Construction of the carrier began in the mid-2010s, although the precise date is unknown. The National Interest reported that construction began in March 2015, while The Diplomat said that \\"initial work\\" had begun in February 2016, followed by a notice to proceed given to the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard Group in March 2017. The construction of Type 003 aircraft carrier was reportedly delayed in June 2017 while the Navy tested electromagnetic and steam-powered catapult systems. By November 2017, the Navy had reportedly developed a new means of powering electromagnetic catapults with conventional power sources instead of nuclear reactors, and further work on the Type 003 was due to begin imminently. The design breakthrough is led by Rear Admiral Ma Weiming. The ship is expected to be launched in 2020 and enter active service in 2023. It is estimated to have an aircraft capacity of about 40 fighter aircraft, several propeller-powered transport and airborne early warning and control aircraft all operated by pilots of the People's Liberation Army Navy Air Force. On 7 May 2019, the Center for Strategic and International Studies identified overhead imagery of the hull under construction in satellite photographs. The images showed a bow section that appeared to end with a flat 30-metre (98-foot) front and a separate hull section 41 metres wide, suggesting that the vessel will be larger than the unbuilt 85,000-ton Soviet aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk but smaller than the 100,000-ton supercarriers of the United States Navy. Its displacement and capabilities have also been suggested to be comparable to that of the American of the early 1960s.

He is best known for his single \\"Get Up & Go\\", recorded under A.Tone Da Priest, which has been featured on MTV programs Scrubbing In (TV series) and Follow the Rules. He has since focused on more rock oriented material under his given name. His style has been described as \\"highly melodic\\",\\"BandBlurb\\" \\"sing songy rock funk\\", or self-described by Restrepo as \\"riff driven moon rock\\". Life and career Marco Restrepo was born in Marietta, Georgia, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. He grew up listening to Jackie Wilson, other Motown acts and commercial radio. During high school he adopted the name A.Tone Da Priest and began rapping with friend Sean Spellz in a group called 1Up. He began self-producing material in 2006 and eventually put out his first mixtape online titled Still A Rapper Pt. 1. While a senior at Chamblee Charter High School in 2007, a recommendation from hip hop production team J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, landed him an internship at a premier Atlanta recording studio. There he learned how to record and engineer and began to take his craft more seriously. Since that time, he released one EP and four full-length albums, The Address EP (2011), Stand By My Words (2011), The Fi King (2012), October Sky (2012), and Come Fly With Me (2013), under his A.Tone moniker. In 2012, bored with rap music and looking for new outlets, Restrepo taught himself how to play guitar and began incorporating it into his music. The Fi King and October Sky would both prove to be guitar heavy albums. Soon however he shifted focus from his rap persona and began working on material under his birth name, Marco Restrepo. In late 2014/early 2015, Restrepo released two albums, 1989 (2014) and Lonely Hearts Club (2015). He took on the task of playing all of the instruments featured on the projects. He was credited with guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and percussion. Although general consensus of his new material was positive and even at times boastful of his genius and originality, he was criticized for his \\"garage band sound\\" which some critics felt held him back from his full potential. In the summer of 2015, he announced that two LP's titled Promised Land and Change were in the works. Restrepo has long been a content creator on YouTube for his material and has gained well over a million views cumulatively across his many videos and channels. His first national break occurred in 2014 when his song \\"Get Up & Go\\" from his Stand By My Words album was featured on a short lived MTV series called Scrubbing In (TV series) and again in 2015 on a reality show about rapper Ja Rule's family life called Follow the Rules. Style Restrepo has mentioned Sum 41, Nirvana, The Beatles, Nick Drake, Buddy Holly, Eazy-E and T.I. as favorite artists. His compositions have spanned from southern style conscious rap works to his newer instrument based material which reviewers describe as \\"new age psychedelic rock\\". His music overall is said to be \\"an unobstructed view into the heart of an artist who embraces each moment\\". Personal life In 2012 Restrepo graduated from Georgia State University in Atlanta with a bachelor's degree in Marketing. He is the nephew of The Detroit Cobras long tenured guitarist Mary Ramirez.

In 2017, the aircraft was transferred to the orbital launch subsidiary, Virgin Orbit, and its livery updated to Virgin Orbit livery. It attempted its first launch on 25 May 2020. Airliner Cosmic Girl was assembled in 2001 at the Boeing Everett Factory. It was configured as a 44/32/310 B747-41R, c/n. 32745. The aircraft's first flight was on 29 September 2001, and it was delivered to Virgin Atlantic on 31 October 2001, where it was registered as G-VWOW.

She was instrumental in gaining legal recognition of Candombl√© and its rituals, bringing an end to centuries of prejudice against Afro-Brazilians, who practiced their faith. When she died on 13 August 1986, the State of Bahia declared a three-day state mourning in her honour, and the City Council of Salvador held a special session to pay tributes to her. The Terreiro do Gantois temple has been declared a protected national monument. Biography Maria Escol√°stica da Concei√ß√£o Nazar√© Assun√ß√£o was born on 10 February 1894 in Salvador, Bahia. Her grand mother, who had baptized her, gave her the nickname as Menininha meaning \\"Little girl\\" She was born into a matriarchal society to Maria da Gl√≥ria and Joaquim Assun√ß√£o, who were Afro-Brazilian with Yoruba Nigerian royal ancestry from Egba-Alak√™ in Abeokut√°, a kingdom in the southwestern part of Nigeria. Her great grandparents, Maria J√∫lia da Concei√ß√£o do Nazar√© and Francisco Nazar√© Eta, were the first blacks to be freed from slavery. Maria J√∫lia's daughter Damiana was the mother of . Menininha was initiated into the worship of deities at the Terreiro do Gantois when she was 8 years old by her grandmother Maria Julia da Concei√ß√£o Nazar√© who had built the temple \\"Ile Iy√° Omi Ax√© Iyamass√™\\". She was married to Alvaro MacDowell de Oliveira and they had two daughters. The elder daughter was M√£e Cleusa da Concei√ß√£o Nazar√© de Oliveira, born in 1923, who was a doctor and who became the inherited Candombl√© priestess of the temple after her mother's death. She died in 1998 and was succeeded by Menininha's other daughter, M√£e Carmem. As spiritual heads of their temple, all of the Candombl√© priestesses receive the honorific 'm√£e', which in the Portuguese language means \\"mother\\". Career The temple, which she headed was established by her grandmother M√£e Pulqu√©ria following a dispute over leadership from Engenho Velho, an older temple said to be one of the oldest Candombl√© temple (1830 or even 100 years older) in Bahia which had been built by three freed African women. Two temples were built, one was the Terreiro do Gantois built in 1900 by M√£e Pulqu√©ria and the other was Ile Axe Opo Afonja credited to M√£e Aninha. M√£e Pulqu√©ria, who was the functional head of the Terreiro do Gantois, died suddenly in 1918. As she had no children, her niece Maria da Gl√≥ria Nazar√© was designated as her successor, but Maria died in 1920 before assuming office. Then according to hierarchical rights the temple was given to Mother Menininha. This process was confirmed by deities Ox√≥ssi, Shango, Oshun and Babal√∫-Ay√©. Once chosen and confirmed in 1922 Menininha became the head of the Candombl√© do Gantois. She dedicated her life to the temple and for the cause of the African religion of Candombl√© which represented to her the \\"last stronghold of the black dignity\\". She faced persecution at the hands of the Brazilian government and even incarceration, as well as being subjected to harassment. She defended the African-Brazilian traditions of worship at the Terreiro do Gantois and other Terreiros at Engenho Velho and Casa Branca. Her struggle, in association with other well known candombl√© priesteses like Stella de Oxossi, asserted the Africanness of Candomb√©, stressing the fact that their religion was not the same as Roman Catholicism. One of the reasons she became prominent was that she initiated hundreds of \\"daughters\\" into the faith, as well as artists, and invited the academic community to study the roots of the religion. One of those academics, Ruth Landes compiled her findings and published a book, City of Women (1947) discussing how the racial policies of the government were intertwined with the Candombl√© religious rites. Ant√¥nio Carlos Magalh√£es, a powerful senator from Bahia; Caryb√©, the illustrator; and and Pierre Verger, two other anthropologists who studied Afro-Brazilian communities, were also prominent connections used by Menininha to further study and promote the validity of Candombl√©. These studies were influential in furthering research on the Nigerian roots of the religion, but at the same time brought criticism from other temples in the faith that Menininha was exploiting the religion. However, her success in obtaining legalization of the religion in the 1970s facilitated the first freedom to practice their faith in hundreds of years and began the process of eliminating prejudice against other Afro-Brazilian faiths. Legacy Menininha died at the age of 92 on 13 August 1986. At the special session held in the City Council of Salvador to commemorate her death, Edvaldo Britto, Deputy Mayor; Pedro Godinho, President of the House; her friends; and attended. Veloso paid a tribute to the mother by highlighting her role as the priestess in leading the resistance and fighting against discrimination and religious faith. Her successor to the temple was her daughter Cleusa who was chosen as priestess in 1989. Upon Cleusa's death, the deities chose her younger sister, to succeed her. Menininha became a symbol of motherhood and spiritual daughter of the Orixa Oxum. Her ritual chair, which appears like a throne, is placed at the entry to the city museum in Salvador.  Poems  Many songs have been written paryear songs seeking her blessings and spiritual guidance. Beth Carvalho, a famous singer paid tribute to her in his composition titled 'O Encanto do Gantois, in 1985. One of these poems reads: Prayer to Mother Menininha Oh my mother My Mother Menininha Oh my mother The little girl Gantois The most beautiful star, huh? It's in the Gantois And the brightest sun, huh? It's in the Gantois The beauty of the world, huh? It's in the Gantois And the hand of sweetness, huh? It's in the Gantois The comfort us, eh?

Early life and business Pranker was born in 1792 in Wilton, Wiltshire. In 1820 he emigrated to the United States. He engaged in the manufacturing of woolen goods in North Andover, Massachusetts until 1832 or 1833, when he moved to Salem, New Hampshire. He would eventually sell his Salem operation to his business partner. Pranker mills In 1838, Pranker purchased an abandoned mill in Saugus, Massachusetts. He renovated the mill and installed new machinery. At his mill, Pranker engaged in the manufacturing of flannel and bed sheets. Although the conditions of the wool business in general were extremely poor during the mill's first years of operation, the business was a success. In 1840, he was able to pay off the bond on the property. By 1846, Pranker's business had grown so much that he had to build a second mill. Also in 1846, Pranker enlarged a dam on the Saugus River by two feet, which raised the water level of a pond that bears his name. In 1857, Pranker, his son George Pranker, and John Armitage incorporated the Edward Pranker & Co. textile firm. Also that year, Pranker had frame buildings constructed for wool pulling and sheepskin tanning. In 1860 he built another mill on the opposite side of the road. Pranker remained involved with the business until his death in 1865. In addition to textile manufacturing, Pranker was also one of the founders of the Saugus Branch Railroad.

The piece was performed at his own funeral.  History  Eugen Schauman, in whose memory the work was conceived The work was written to commemorate Eugen Schauman who had in 1904 shot Governor-General Nikolay Bobrikov and then killed himself. Sibelius mentioned on New Year's Day of 1905 \\"that he intended to write a requiem in memory of Eugen Schauman and that he had already started to work on it. ‚Äì I just hope it will be worthy of its subject matter! After all, it will be the only monument that we can raise for him!\\" Only in 1909, after his throat surgery which made him think of death, he returned to the idea. Erik Tawaststjerna assumes that he wrote it also for himself. He composed a first version in 1909, completed on 14 December 1909. His models were the funeral marches of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3 \\"Eroica\\" and Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung. The work in sonata form is introduced by the violins and violas, with a main theme developing \\"like the approach of a distant cortege\\". He sent the work to the publisher Breitkopf.

Sibelius composed it in 1899 on a poem by Zachris Topelius, a Swedish-language Finnish poet, who had dedicated it to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, thus escaping censorship. The piece was an \\"explicit protest composition\\" against a Russia restricting the autonomy of the Grand Duchy of Finland. Sibelius wrote it for a lottery of the Savonian-Karelian Students' Association, where he conducted the first performance on 21October 1899.  Background and history  Sibelius composed ' in a political context. Most of what is now Finland had been part of Sweden until Russia won the territory in the Finnish War and ruled it as a Grand Duchy. It was first autonomous in terms of a parliament, money, and schools in Swedish and Finnish, but Nikolay Bobrikov, the Russian Governor-General, tried to limit these liberties and even proposed schooling only in Russian. Sibelius composed music as patriotic statements against the restricting censorship, in ', first performed on 21October at a lottery of the Savo-Karelian Students' Association in Helsinki, and in Finlandia, first performed as part of the Press Celebration Music two weeks later. Sibelius conducted the first performance, the premiere. He used the choral theme again for children's choir a cappella, The Landscape Breathes (Nejden andas). After the first performance, Sibelius made a note about the composition, \\"should be revised\\", which he later did.  Composition  The breaking of the ice is an annual event in some northern countries, releasing winter and ending immobility. The text for ' is a poem by Zachris Topelius, a Swedish-language Finnish poet. The poem lists many rivers besides the one in the title, summarizing Finland. He dedicated it to Tsar Alexander II, thus protecting it from censorship. Sibelius, like the poet, interpreted the frozen river as a symbol of the Russian oppression, and the breaking of the ice as an image of freedom. Sibelius confirmed the underlying meaning of the music when he programmed its premiere to be followed by Song of the Athenians, a song for freedom first performed half a year earlier and held high by Finnish nationalists. The composition is subtitled \\"improvisation for narrator, men's chorus and orchestra\\". The subtitle is Sibelius' own description of the work, it has otherwise been described as a melodrama, cantata and choir suite. It begins and ends with recitation for the narrator, accented by brass chords. The center of the work is a dramatic chorus, often in unison and accompanied by a symphony orchestra. It has been considered as a test piece for Finlandia in terms of accessibility and some effects of orchestration.

The site, approximately 450 √ó 150 meters in extent, is located a mile or so inland, at the top of the Iverian Mountain. It is the most complete surviving building of ancient Anacopia, the former capital of the Kingdom of Abkhazia. History A military structure was constructed here between the second and fourth centuries. At the end of the seventh century walls were constructed around the site of the citadel, with support from the Byzantines who had become alarmed by Islamist expansionism. The walls, up to 60 com (2 feet) thick, are constructed of largely tightly assembled and carefully hewn limestone blocks. There is a single entrance, a small gate on the south side of the enclosure. At the centre is a Roman style tower, four storeys high, with excellent views in all directions across the surrounding landscape and, to the south-west of the fortress, the Black Sea. A small Christian basilica was also constructed in the centre of the fortress during or before the eighth century. The stone altar from it survives (2014), along with some frescoes featuring a cross and some fishes, a religious symbol frequently used by early Christians in and around the Eastern Roman empire. Next to the church is a cistern filled naturally with spring water by means of a 25 meter deep well beneath it. During the eighth century Anacopia found itself near the moving frontier that separated Byzantine Christendom from the Umayyad Caliphate, and in 736/737 Ab≈´  øAbd Al-Malik MarwƒÅn ibn Mu·∏•ammad, the future Marwan II, appeared outside the walls with a force of 60,000 men and laid siege to what was by now the capital of the Abkhazian Kingdom. The Georgian chronicle relates that the citadel was defended by a force of 1,000 Iberians and 2,000 Abkhazians under the leadership of Leon I of Abkhazia. The chronicle recalls that the Arab forces suffered from an epidemic that killed 35,000 of them while a further 3,000 were killed in the fighting. The successful defence of Anacopia is regarded as a pivotal turning point in Georgian history. A restoration was undertaken in 2008 to improve the safety of the site and reinstate the tower as a usable lookout point.

The upper and steepest part of the climb consists of 450 m of cobbled surface. Kruisberg is the unofficial name of the Oudestraat and Oude Kruisens roads, which run parallel to Ronse's actual Kruisberg, a broad concrete road.

The Kruisberg should not be confused with the Kluisberg, a nearby hill and forest in the neighbouring municipality of Kluisbergen. Cycling The climb is best known from cycling, as it regularly features in the spring classics, most notably the Tour of Flanders. The 1.000 m climb starts going gently uphill from the center of Ronse. The upper ‚Äì and steepest ‚Äì part of the climb has a roughly- paved cobbled surface, totaling 450 m of cobbles. After the cobbled section, the road continues on a 23 m elevation on a broad gently-sloped asphalt road to the top of the Hotond hill which overlooks the city.

Design and construction Designed by Cesare Frescot, the Class 650 was designed in light of the forthcoming opening (in 1889) of the new relief Giovi railway, which supplemented the old line opened in the 1850s and was less steep (1.6% maximum instead of 3.5%). Previous fast locomotives were of the 4-4-0 arrangement; Frescot decided to add one more driving axle to ensure that the locomotive would be able to pull the increased loads without exceeding the axle load limits. He also discarded the Belpaire firebox, common in SFAI locomotive practice, for a round-top firebox, which would be a mainstay of Italian locomotive practice. The first locomotives had a working boiler pressure of , while subsequent locomotives enjoyed a greater pressure of ; three locomotives were also fitted a longer boiler with a combustion chamber.

Service and modifications The first locomotive was the only one given a running number by the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia, and was also the only one given a name (\\"Vittorio Emanuele II\\", in honour of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy), as just as it was completed the transition between the SFAI and the Rete Mediterranea was being executed. The Class 650 proved very successful, being able to pull 130 tons over the new Giovi railway at a speed of . However, the steady increasing of the train's weight meant that these locomotives were gradually replaced by more powerful ones. The last locomotives of the Class 650 were withdrawn in the 1920s, with none surviving into preservation. Some units of the class were rebuilt under the FS period with the boiler of the FS Class 656.

Early life In his younger years, Small ran a drapers' shop in Glasgow, then moved his business to Cambuslang,\\"Death of Mr William Small\\", Hamilton Herald, 24 January 1903 and finally to Blantyre.AUTHOR, Nationalization in British Politics: The Historical Background, p.115 There, he became involved in the land reform movement.David Howell, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, pp.32, 296 Trade unionism in the 1880s Alexander Macdonald had been the leading miners' trade union organiser in Lanarkshire. He died in 1881, and Andrew McCowie, who had met Small through the land reform movement, believed that Small would be McDonald's ideal successor. Small's draper business was not going well, and he was persuaded, devoting the remainder of his life to the cause.\\"The Late William Small, Miners' Secretary\\", The Scotsman, 24 January 1903 In 1885, he worked with older activists such as Robert Steel to call meetings of miners in Lanarkshire with a view to founding a branch of the Lanarkshire Miners' Union. Among those who attended was Robert Smillie, who regarded Small as an early mentor. Smillie noted that Small would rise early in the morning to walk to meetings as much as twenty miles away, and in summer would often sleep outdoors to avoid having to complete the return journey the same day.Torquil Cowan, Labour of Love: The Story of Robert Smillie The union was led by Keir Hardie, with Small succeeding as secretary in 1885. He led the union in supporting Hardie's campaign at the 1888 Mid Lanarkshire by-election, and Small chaired many of Hardie's campaign meetings.E. Eldon Barry, Nationalization in British Politics: The Historical Background, p.115 Small also attended UK-wide miners' conferences in 1886 and 1889. Politics Small's politics gradually moved towards socialism, and his cottage became a centre for discussions between leading socialist activists, including William Morris, Henry Hyndman and Edward Carpenter.John H. M. Laslett, Colliers Across the Sea, p.167 Small joined Hardie's Scottish Labour Party, eventually becoming a vice-president, and was considered as a potential candidate in Dundee at the 1892 general election, though he was not ultimately selected.E. Eldon Barry, Nationalization in British Politics: The Historical Background, p.128 He attended the 1892 and 1893 Trades Union Congresses; at the first, he and Smillie jointly proposed nationalising the mines and also mineral rights. The county union appears to have dissolved around 1890, but several local miners unions were established in the county, Small leading the Blantyre Miners' Trade Union. In 1896, this became part of a new Lanarkshire Miners' County Union.Robert Thomson, The County of Lanark, p.84 In 1893, Small was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party, serving on its first National Administrative Council. In 1894, he was selected as its candidate for one of the seats in Edinburgh at the next general election, but he withdrew before the contest. He remained close to Smillie, and would accompany him on trips to London; Smillie would attend meetings, while Small would conduct research on Scottish mining law at the British Library. Later years Small was less central to mining trade unionism by the turn of the century, devoting some of his time to an elected post on Blantyre's School Board. Although he remained in good health, he died suddenly in January 1903. Two of his sons followed him into trade unionism: Robert became secretary of the Scottish Shale Miners in 1912, while William B. became secretary of the Lanarkshire Miners in the 1920s.Alan Campbell, The Scottish Miners, 1874-1939: Trade unions and politics, p.101 A younger son, Gladstone Lothian Rosebery, attended the University of Glasgow and stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate for Parliament.University of Glasgow, \\"Staff Lieutenant Gladstone Lothian Rosebery Small\\" References 1845 births 1903 deaths Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members Trade unionists from Glasgow Scottish Labour Party (1888) politicians ","title":"William Small (trade unionist)"},{"id":"48735784","text":"KallistiOS is a free, BSD license-based development system for the Sega Dreamcast game console.

There were other acts of protests prior to, during and after May 24, 1957, across Taiwan and in Taipei that led U.S. government officials behind-the-scenes to refer to these events as \\"riots\\" but U.S. officials deliberately spoke of a \\"riot\\" to avoid any adverse psychological impact on its alliance with the ROC. Similarly, the May 24 incident was seen then and later as an \\"anti-American\\" protest. Although Chiang Kai-shek, president of the ROC, described the attitudes of his citizens as \\"anti-American,\\" Chiang publicly referred to the events of May 24 as an \\"unfortunate incident\\" (‰∏çÂπ∏‰∫ãËÆä).Stephen G. Craft, American Justice in Taiwan, The 1957 Riots and Cold War Foreign Policy. (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2016), p. 142. Background In 1951, the U.S. government agreed to establish a Military Advisory and Assistance Group-Taiwan. By January 1957, there were over 10,000 Americans living on Taiwan of which 61% were composed of MAAG advisers and their dependents. The U.S. government insisted that all of its civilian and military personnel including their dependents possess diplomatic immunity with the result that approximately 1000 Americans were subject to ROC law. Starting in 1955, the ROC and U.S. governments engaged in negotiations to establish a Status of Forces Agreement but talks failed because the ROC demanded the right to try U.S. personnel for rape and murder whereas the U.S. State and Defense Departments insisted on \\"exclusive jurisdiction\\". Prior to the riots, U.S.-ROC relations were already fraught with tensions in part because of criminal behavior including rape on the part of MAAG personnel.Ibid., pp. 51-59. On March 20, 1957, Sgt. Robert G. Reynolds, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who had served in Taiwan for two years as a member of MAAG, confronted Liu Ziran, purportedly a Republic of China Army Major and staff member at the Institute of Revolutionary Practice in Taiwan, outside Reynolds' duplex home on Yangmingshan (known to locals as Grass Mountain). Reynolds claimed that Liu had been peeping through the bathroom window while his wife took a bath and that when he went to the front of the duplex and called out to Liu, Liu approached with a three-foot long object leading Reynolds to fire his .22 caliber revolver. He further claimed that after trying to hail Taiwanese military policemen, Liu approached a second time leading Reynolds to fire a second round. Wounded a second time, Liu walked toward a park across the street from the duplex. Later, Liu's body was found nearly 200 feet away from the duplex. Almost immediately, U.S. and ROC criminal investigators reached different conclusions about the shooting, Initially, the Americans believed that Reynolds acted in self-defense and did not intend to pursue charges. Although ROC investigators discounted Taiwan newspaper reports that claimed that Reynolds killed Liu because both were either involved in the black market or were in love with the same Taiwanese woman, they concluded that Reynolds killed in cold blood. Liu's body faced in the direction of Reynolds' duplex suggesting that he had not been shot twice while in the act of running away but rather at pointblank range at the spot where the body lay. Moreover, no object fitting the description provided by Reynolds was found anywhere near the duplex or the body. ROC pressure eventually led U.S. authorities to hold hearings to determine if Reynolds should face court-martial. These hearings recommended that Reynolds be charged with involuntary manslaughter on the basis that while the first shot might have been fired out of fear, Reynolds could have retreated rather than putting himself in a situation to fire a second, and what proved to be a fatal, shot.Ibid., pp. 7-9. 60-74. On May 20, 1957, a U.S. military court-martial convened in Taipei in the MAAG chapel. Reynolds' defense attorney told the jury of five colonels and three sergeants, all of whom served in Taiwan, that Liu was a man intent on raping Reynolds' wife and that Reynolds merely tried to protect his family. The prosecution argued that after firing the first shot, Reynolds did not have to capture what he latter claimed was a burglar but instead should have retreated into his home and called police. Thus, he killed Liu out of the heat of anger. On May 23, though, the jury acquitted Reynolds of all charges. The not-guilty verdict angered ROC citizens who viewed the trial as rigged and could not understand how a person could kill another and not receive some type of punishment. Taiwanese were also outraged that an American could claim self-defense in a situation in which there was no evidence that Liu possessed any weapon.Ibid., pp. 75-100. Riots On May 24 at around 10:00 a.m., Liu's widow arrived outside the U.S. Embassy with her daughter holding a poster that stated in English and Chinese: \\"The Killer--Reynolds is Innocent? Protest against US Court-Martial Unfair, Unjust Decision.\\" Within hours, a mob of 6,000 gathered outside the embassy, chanting anti-American slogans and demanding justice for Liu. In the afternoon, waves of rioters entered the embassy doing damage including smashing vehicles and furniture and destroying the American flag. Eight Americans hiding in a basement bomb shelter were driven out, some with serious injuries. Separately, a mob surrounded the Sugar Building, headquarters for MAAG-Taiwan, while another mob wrecked two USIS buildings. Eventually, protesters surrounded the Taipei Municipal Police building and wreaked destruction. When a police officer was shot, other officers opened fire on the mob. Although the ROC government ordered military forces into Taipei to restore order, rioters continued to do damage to the embassy into the evening. By the end of what became known as Black Friday, 11 Americans, 62 police officers, and 11 rioters were injured and 1 rioter was dead. The police arrested 111. The damage to the U.S. Embassy and USIS buildings totaled over $500,000 ($4 million in 2015 terms).Ibid., pp. 101-117, 120. Aftermath The U.S. government immediately filed a protest with the ROC and accused various ROC officials including Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, of deliberately instigating the riots. ROC officials including Chiang Kai-shek did apologize for the riots, but the official ROC report denied allegations that the government planned and instigated the protests and riots. Instead, the report claimed that the protesters acted out of anger against the verdict in a manner that reflected spontaneity and mob psychology. The report also restated the ROC position that Reynolds had committed murder. An internal ROC investigation blamed the Chinese media in Taiwan and Hong Kong for writing inflammatory stories about the court-martial and for the rigid chain of command that prohibited ROC authorities from preventing the protests from evolving into riots. Of those arrested, 70 were released without charge. Of the remaining 41, 28 were found guilty. Two were sentenced to one year in prison, the maximum punishment meted out; the rest were sentenced to two to five months in prison. The riots ultimately reflected Chinese and Taiwanese anger over the verdict and diplomatic immunity which was perceived as extraterritoriality. The riots also touched the nerves of Asians who had their own resentments about the actions of U.S. military personnel especially in Japan which was already dealing with the Girard incident. Ultimately, both the ROC and U.S. managed to prevent the incident from causing a break in the alliance.ÂåÖÊã¨ÂîêÂæ∑Ââõ„ÄÅÂäâÂÆúËâØÈÉΩË™çÁÇ∫ÔºåÂäâËá™ÁÑ∂‰∫ã‰ª∂ÊòØËî£Á∂ìÂúã\\"‰øÑÂºèÈ†òÂ∞é\\"ÁöÑÂàùË©¶ÂïºËÅ≤„ÄÇ‰πü‰ª£Ë°®ËëóÂè∞ÁÅ£Âç≥Â∞áÈÄ≤ÂÖ•\\"Ëî£Á∂ìÂúãÊôÇ‰ª£\\"; Craft, American Justice in Taiwan, pp. 128-130, 131-163.

She was a prominent figure during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. She is one of the people credited with bringing together RISE ‚Äì Scotland's Left Alliance, a left-wing electoral alliance created ahead of the 2016 Scottish Parliament general election. She stood, unsuccessfully, as a RISE candidate for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election on the Glasgow regional list. RISE did not gain any seats in the 2016 election. Boyd co-authored a book that was published in 2014 and writes a weekly column for The National newspaper. Background Boyd studied economics and Spanish at the University of Strathclyde. Her mother, Isabelle Boyd, is a former headteacher who was also the Assistant Chief Executive for Education, Youth and Communities at North Lanarkshire Council, and accepted a CBE in 2009. Activist It was during the campaign ahead of the Scottish independence referendum that Boyd emerged as a prominent activist. In November 2012 she co-founded the Radical Independence Campaign, which supported a left-wing vision of an independent Scotland. Boyd also sat on the editorial board of the Scottish Left Review. While the outcome of the referendum was \\"No\\" to independence, the months that followed saw a new coalition forming- the Scottish Left Project. Boyd described the project not as a party but a way to link up with other socialists, community activists, trade unions, social justice campaigners and activists. On 17 November 2016, Boyd made her first appearance on BBC Question Time where she condemned the 2016 vote for Brexit, then divulged that she herself had not voted in the EU referendum, which was met by jeers from the audience. In July 2017, during an appearance on a television show, Boyd said that she had voted for the Labour Party at the 2017 UK general election. She later articulated that for that election she saw herself as a pro-independence Corbyn supporter. RISE Boyd was seen as a spokesperson as speculation grew around a socialist challenge being formed for the Scottish Parliament elections in 2016, having been involved with protests against austerity and appearing at The Left Field at the 2015 Glastonbury Festival. She had cited the need for a new left-wing force on the basis that she considered the Labour party to have collapsed. She also spoke against involving figures like Tommy Sheridan who had been seen as divisive. She was hopeful about momentum of the project in reviving a socialist movement in Scotland. After the alliance was launched at the end of August, with support from the Scottish Socialist Party, Boyd said she thought RISE would appeal to ex-Labour voters. In January 2016, RISE announced that they had selected Boyd as a candidate for the Scottish Parliament election in 2016 and that she would top their regional list for Glasgow. RISE did not gain any seats nationally, polling just 1% in Glasgow and coming eighth (behind Sheridan's Solidarity movement). Writer Boyd co-wrote Scottish Independence: A Feminist Response with Jenny Morrison, a book published in 2014, exploring the contemporary relevance of Scottish feminist history. On the 2015 International Women's Day she spoke about women and the referendum at a meeting at Sinn F√©in's Ard Fheis. She has also been an advocate of social justice and internationalism.

Built in 1735, it was occupied by British Armed Forces until 1922 when it was turned over to the Irish Defence Forces after the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The Irish Army continued to operate the site as an ammunition store through the mid-20th century. It was fully demilitarised by the 1980s. The fort is now managed by the Office of Public Works. As of 2015, it was in a derelict state and not open to the public, however some repairs were undertaken and the site partially opened for \\"limited guided tours\\" from 2016. History Background In the 1530s, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, lands within what is now the Phoenix Park were confiscated from the Knights Hospitaller. These lands were later leased to Sir Edward Fisher. By 1611, Fisher had built a house known as \\"Phoenix Lodge\\" on St Thomas' Hill. By the mid-17th century, Fisher's house and lands were returned to the state, and the house used as the seat of the Lord Deputy of Ireland. Although Thomas Burgh (1670‚Äì1730) had engineered a larger earthwork star fort quite close by in 1710, by the 1730s, the then Lord Lieutenant, Lionel Sackville (1688‚Äì1765) directed that a new gunpowder store be built at St Thomas' Hill on the site of the house. Phoenix Lodge was therefore demolished in 1734, and construction on the magazine fort commenced in 1735 to designs by engineer John Corneille. At the time the city was relatively poor, prompting the satirist Jonathan Swift to publish a verse on the seeming futility of the fortification: Construction Extract from 1757 map, showing Burgh's earthwork fort (demolished 1837) and Corneille's powder magazine Unlike de Burgh's nearby star fort, which was primarily earthwork and demolished in the 1830s, Corneille's bastion fort was built of brick and limestone. The main body of the fort is approximately 2 acres in area and is surrounded by a dry moat. Each corner is defended by a demi-bastion (with embrasures), and the walls are approximately thick. The large barrel-vaulted brick magazine chambers themselves are approximately in size and located to the north-west of the main enclosure. These were serviced by overhead cranes and gantries ‚Äì for moving powder kegs. A later triangular barracks and accommodation block was added on the south-side in 1801, to designs by Francis Johnston. Other sheds and outbuildings were added in the 20th century. 1793 plan of the fort referencing \\"a Howitzer\\" defending the gate Defences A 1793 survey indicates that a large artillery piece was used to defend the main gateway. By the 1890s, there were ten 12-pounder guns mounted at the fort. In the early 20th century, the corner demi-bastions were converted to include concrete pillbox machine-gun posts. Raids In use by British and Irish forces for 250 years, the fort was subject to two notable raids in the 20th century. The first occurred on 24 April 1916, during the Easter Rising, when predominantly young members of Fianna √âireann raided the fort for arms, and set explosives to blow it up, however, \\"after setting fires to blow up the magazine‚Äôs ordinance; but the fuses burned out before reaching the ammunition and little damage was caused.\\" Some of the first shots of the Easter Rising were believed to have been fired during this raid, when an unarmed member of the garrison household and an armed sentry were shot. The latter was seriously injured but apparently survived; the former died nine hours later. These marked the first shootings of the Easter Rising.Many contemporary accounts (e.g. Irish Times, 29 April 1916) suggested the garrison commander's adolescent son (Gerald Playfair, aged 14) was shot dead by an IRA volunteer, Garry Holohan. A later investigation (e.g. Duffy/History Ireland) purports that it was an elder son (George Alexander \\"Alec\\" Playfair, aged 23) who was killed. The second raid occurred on 23 December 1939 when, during the so-called \\"Christmas Raid\\", members of the Irish Republican Army raided the magazine for weapons and more than one million rounds of ammunition. Most of the stolen equipment was recovered over the following weeks. Today Magazine fort demi-bastion and moat. Some 18th- century walls were rendered with concrete in the early 20th century As with other military installations within Dublin, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the Irish defence forces took possession of the fort from British armed forces. The Irish Army continued to operate the facility, including time as an ammunition store, until 1988, when it was handed over to the Office of Public Works (OPW). Though some repair and maintenance works had previously been carried out by the OPW, as of 2015, the site was in a somewhat derelict state. Unlike similar structures elsewhere (for example Camden Fort Meagher in Crosshaven, or Elizabeth Fort in Cork), the fort had not seen any investment for heritage tourism purposes ‚Äì although the possibility of such works was referenced from time to time. Some repairs were undertaken in 2016 to allow for the site to be partially opened to the public - initially as part of 1916 Rising centenary events. As of 2019, and with \\"conservation works [..] on- going within the fort\\", the OPW operate guided tours of the site, with limited tours departing the Phoenix Park visitor centre at set times on Sundays, from April to October.

At the Academy he developed close friendships with Cesare Ferro and Felice Carena.Notes for exhibition of Solo Donna by Gianfranco Schialvino in the city of Bra in 2011, page 58. In 1903 he made his d√©but at the \\"Societ√† Promotrice delle Belle Arti\\" (Fine Arts' Promotion Society) of Turin attracting the interest and curiosity both of the public as well as that of the critics. In 1904 he exhibited in Paris. In the same year he painted one of his most famous pictures, Ribelli (Rebels), a personal interpretation of The Fourth Estate by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, which was well received mainly due to its technical and chromatic technique. Domenico Buratti gained quite a fame also thanks to his work as an illustrator. In 1910 he illustrated with watercolours and drawings the poetry book for children Il Cestello (\\"The Basket\\") by Angiolo Silvio Novaro, in 1912 La bottega dello stregone (\\"The sorcerer's shop\\"). Several years later, in 1937, he illustrated the fairytale book Ruggine (\\"Rust\\") by Renzo Pezzani. In 1913 he met the painter Vittoria Cocito, whom he married in 1920 and from whom he had three daughters, Vanna, Chiaretta e Lella. In 1917 he left as an infantryman for the World War I front. Following the Italian defeat at Caporetto, he was captured and interned in Dolmen, in Westphalia (Germany). In 1918 he escaped with some comrades and took refuge in the Netherlands. He managed to return to Italy in 1919. His works show a return to subjects linked to his country and to his traditions as well as to nature; paintings by Buratti of this period include Il presepe (the cr√®che), Il babbo stipettaio (the father cabinetmaker) and La cuoca (the lady cook), all executed between 1920 and 1923. In 1928 he took over, with his brother Tino, a small publishing company, the Fratelli Ribet later called \\"Fratelli Buratti\\" (the Buratti Brothers) which operated until 1932 publishing works by young writers which were unknown at the time, such as Montale, Alvaro, Stuparich, Slataper. In 1930 he published his poetry collection Paese e galera (\\"Country and prison\\"), which was written while he was a prisoner. Between the end of the Thirties and the beginning of the Forties he developed a greater interest in portrait and landscape. Due to the World War II the Buratti family gathered once again in Nole; the artist's renewed energy was almost entirely concentrated towards poetical creation; in 1945 a second poetry collection, Canzoni di strada (Street songs), written between 1904 and 1930 was released. His works in this period include mostly still lifes and some portraits. Between 1945 and 1948 he was one of the founders of the \\"Libera Accademia di Belle Arti\\" (Fine Arts' Free Academy). He died in Turin on 24 May 1960 and was buried in Nole.

The stated objectives of the publication are: * Provide comprehensive information on the two thousand years of history and the present state of Eastern Orthodoxy; * Acquaint the reader with the other Christian confessions, non-Christian religions, as well as the phenomena of science, culture, philosophy, art and politics related to religion. History 10 October 1996, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church approved the edition of 25-volume Orthodox Encyclopedia. To implement the project was formed: Supervisory, Trustees, Church-scientific and editorial boards, as well as the Association of philanthropists. Sergey Leonidovich Kravets [ru] stated: \\"the basic parameters of the upcoming work on Orthodox Encyclopedia were identified in 1997. From the very beginning the Encyclopedia planned to tackle issue that look far beyond the scope of the Orthodox world: it had to be presented basic information on all Christian denominations and other religions, significant material from the fields of philosophy, morality, ethics, art, music. The edition was to be not only an encyclopedia of the Orthodoxy, but as an encyclopedia of the Orthodox view on the human spirit world, on all human spheres of life\\". 19 February 1998 the first meeting of the Scientific and Editorial Board for publication 25-volume was held under the chairmanship of Patriarch Alexy II in the Throne Room of the Synodal residence in St. Daniel's monastery. The Scientific Editorial Board approved the thematic division of the Encyclopedia and determined the time of its creation, based on the need to release the first volume on the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Christ. In addition, it approved the need of interaction with the church and the secular academic institutions, the dioceses of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as with the fraternal local churches. President Yeltsin took the publication under his patronage. Initially, the authors hoped to rely on the unfinished Orthodox Theological Encyclopedia (1900-1911) by and , as on well as the Greek Orthodox Encyclopedia. But already at work on the Dictionnaire it became clear that the information in the Orthodox Theological Encyclopedia, despite their high scientific value, was outdated, while information in the Greek encyclopedia was so narrow national in character that could not be used as the main source for the creation of the conceived common Orthodox encyclopedic set. The entire year 1999 was spent on the preparation of the first, non-alphabetic volume of \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–∞—è —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤—å\\" (\\"Russian Orthodox Church\\") and the completion of the glossary.

He conducted the first performance at the Finnish National Theatre in Helsinki on 2 December 1903. He drew individual works from the score and revised them under two opus numbers: * Op. 44 no. 1 ', completed in 1904 * Op. 44 no. 2 Scene with Cranes, completed in 1906 * Op. 62a Canzonetta (Rondino der Liebenden) for string orchestra, first version in 1906, final version in 1911 * Op. 62b ' (Waltz intermezzo), completed in 1911  Background  Initially, Sibelius wrote six numbers for the 2 December 1903 production: # Tempo di valse lente - Poco risoluto (Act I) # Moderato (Paavali's Song: 'Pakkanen puhurin poika', for solo baritone, Act II) # Moderato assai - Moderato (Elsa's Song: 'Eilaa, eilaa', for solo soprano) - Poco adagio (Act II) # Andante (The Cranes, Act II) # Moderato (Act III) # Andante ma non tanto (Act III) In 1904, he revised No. 1 as Valse triste, and it was performed in Helsinki on 25 April 1904. It was published as Op. 44 in 1905 by Breitkopf & H√§rtel, and immediately took on a life of its own. It became an instant hit with the public, and one of Sibelius's signature pieces. However, because of the publishing contract, Sibelius saw relatively little money in terms of royalties from the performances of Valse triste.Erik W. Tawaststjerna (trans. Robert Layton), Sibelius, Volume II: 1904-1914. Faber and Faber (London, 1986), pp. 45-46. In 1906, he combined Nos. 3 and 4 and revised the music under the title Scene with Cranes. This was performed in Vaasa on 14 December 1906. Sibelius did not ascribe an opus number to it, it was not performed again in his lifetime, and it was not published until 1973, 16 years after his death. In 1906, he wrote a Rondino der Liebenden for string orchestra, adapted from the music for Kuolema. It lay unperformed until 1911. In 1911, J√§rnefelt produced a revised version of the play. For this, Sibelius wrote a revised version of Rondino der Liebenden, which he now called Canzonetta; and a new piece, Valse romantique. These were first performed in Helsinki at the Finnish National Theatre on 8 March 1911, together with Valse triste. The play was not a success, however, hoping to repeat the success of Valse triste with Canzonetta and Valse romantique, Sibelius immediately published them together, as Op. 62a and Op. 62b respectively. They failed to grab the public's attention the way Valse triste had done. In 1973, Scene with Cranes was posthumously published, as Op. 44, No. 2, and Valse triste was retrospectively renumbered as Op. 44, No. 1. Recordings and performances sometimes present Valse triste, Scene with Cranes, Canzonetta and Valse romantique as a unified suite, as it represents the totality of what is known of the incidental music for the two versions of Kuolema. However, this was not Sibelius's intention.  Literature  * M√§kel√§, Tomi: Jean Sibelius und seine Zeit (in German). Laaber-Verlag, Regensburg, 2013.

These embedded services include millions of third-party websites that use Adsense and Analytics. The policy was widely criticized for creating an environment that discourages Internet- innovation by making Internet users more fearful and wary of what they put online. Around December 2009, after privacy concerns were raised, Google's CEO Eric Schmidt declared: \\"If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines‚Äîincluding Google‚Äîdo retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities.\\" Privacy International has raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users' searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the U.S. government. In its 2007 Consultation Report, Privacy International ranked Google as \\"Hostile to Privacy\\", its lowest rating on their report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.\\"Consultation Report: Race to the Bottom? 2007\\" , Privacy International, June 9, 2007Delichatsios, Stefanie Alki; Sonuyi, Temitope, \\"Get to Know Google...Because They Know You\\", MIT, Ethics and Law on the Electronic Frontier, 6.805, December 14, 2005 At the Techonomy conference in 2010, Eric Schmidt predicted that \\"true transparency and no anonymity\\" is the path to take for the internet: \\"In a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you. We need a [verified] name service for people. Governments will demand it.\\" He also said that, \\"If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go. Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!\\" In the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \\"may\\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the \\"Activity controls\\" in the \\"My Account\\" page of a Google account. ProPublica states that \\"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\\" Google contacted ProPublica to correct the fact that it doesn't \\"currently\\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads. Shona Ghosh, a journalist for Business Insider, noted that an increasing digital resistance movement against Google has grown. A major hub for critics of Google in order to organize to abstain from using Google products is the Reddit page for the subreddit r/degoogle. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit organization which deals with civil liberties, has raised concerns regarding privacy issues pertaining to student data after conducting a survey which showed that a majority of parents, students and teachers are concerned that student privacy is being breached.Cope, S., & Cardozo, N.(2018). It's Tie to Make Student Privacy a Priority. Tech & Learning, 38(9), pp. 32-33. According to the EFF, the Federal Trade Commission has ignored complaints from the public that Google has been harvesting student data and search results even after holding talks with the Department of Education in 2018. Google Glass decided not to use facial recognition in the Google Glass Device. The choice not to include is to avoid questioning of privacy. Potential for data disclosure Data leaks On March 10, 2009, Google reported that a bug in Google Docs had allowed unintended access to some private documents. It was believed that 0.05% of all documents stored via the service were affected by the bug. Google stated the bug has now been fixed. Cookies Google places one or more cookies on each user's computer, which is used to track a person's web browsing on a large number of unrelated websites, and track their search history. If you are logged into a Google service, Google also uses the cookies to record which Google Account is accessing each website and doing each search. Originally the cookie did not expire until 2038, although it could be manually deleted by the user or refused by setting a browser preference. As of 2007, Google's cookie expired in two years, but renewed itself whenever a Google service is used. As of 2011, Google said that it anonymizes the IP address data that it collects, after nine months, and the association between cookies and web accesses after 18 months.\\"Privacy FAQ\\", Google, accessed October 16, 2011 and December 20, 2016 As of 2016, Google's privacy policy does not promise anything about whether or when its records about your web browsing or searching are deleted from its records. The non-profit group Public Information Research launched Google Watch, a website advertised as \\"a look at Google's monopoly, algorithms, and privacy issues.\\" The site raised questions relating to Google's storage of cookies, which in 2007 had a life span of more than 32 years and incorporated a unique ID that enabled creation of a user data log. Google faced criticism with its release of Google Buzz, Google's version of social networking, where Gmail users had their contact lists automatically made public unless they opted out. Google shares this information with law enforcement and other government agencies upon receiving a request. The majority of these requests do not involve review or approval by any court or judge.\\"Transparency Report: User Data Requests\\", Google. Retrieved December 20, 2016. Tracking Google is suspected of collecting and aggregating data about Internet users through the various tools it provides to developers, such as Google Analytics, Google Play Services, reCAPTCHA, Google Fonts, and Google APIs. This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the IP address being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google might be able to provide a quite complete web user profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities. Google encourages developers to use their tools and to communicate end-user IP addresses to Google: \\"Developers are also encouraged to make use of the userip parameter to supply the IP address of the end-user on whose behalf you are making the API request. Doing so will help distinguish this legitimate server- side traffic from traffic which doesn't come from an end-user.\\"\\"Developer's Guide\\", Google Web Search API, July 26, 2012.

This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google‚Äôs other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. Google has many sites and services that makes it difficult to track where the information could be viewed online. Following the continuous backlash over aggressive tracking and unknown data retention periods, Google has tried to appeal to growing number of privacy conscious people. On Google I/O 2019, it announced plans to limit data retention period for some of it services, starting with users Web and App Activity. Users can select between 3 months or 18 months to let Google keep their data from the Google Account Dashboard. The data retention period is disabled by default. Gmail Steve Ballmer,Microsoft's Ballmer: Google Reads Your Mail ChannelWeb, October 2007 Liz Figueroa,\\"Google's Gmail could be blocked\\", BBC News, April 13, 2004 Mark Rasch,\\"Google Gmail: Spook Heaven\\", Mark Rasch, The Register, June 15, 2004 and the editors of Google Watch believe the processing of email message content by Google's Gmail service goes beyond proper use. Google Inc. claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being other than the account holder, and content that is read by computers is only used to improve the relevance of advertisements and block spam emails. The privacy policies of other popular email services, like Outlook.com and Yahoo, allow users' personal information to be collected and utilized for advertising purposes. In 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider. In 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \\"Google's kryptonite.\\" Other concerns include the unlimited period for data retention that Google's policies allow, and the potential for unintended secondary uses of the information Gmail collects and stores.\\"What privacy risks are presented by Gmail?\\", Gmail Privacy FAQ, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC).

A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no \\"reasonable expectation\\" exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails.

In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained: A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013 that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users \\"very seriously.\\" A Federal Judge declined to dissolve a lawsuit made by Gmail users who opposed to the use of analyzing the content of the messenger by selling byproducts. In 2017, Google stopped personalizing Gmail ads. CIA and NSA ties In February 2010, Google was reported to be working on an agreement with the National Security Agency (NSA) to investigate recent attacks against its network. And, while the deal did not give NSA access to Google's data on users' searches or e-mail communications and accounts and Google was not sharing proprietary data with the agency, privacy and civil rights advocates were concerned. In October 2004, Google acquired Keyhole, a 3D mapping company. In February 2004, before its acquisition by Google, Keyhole received an investment from In-Q-Tel, the CIA's investment arm.\\"Google buys CIA-backed mapping startup\\", Andrew Orlowski, The Register, October 28, 2004 And in July 2010 it was reported that the investment arms of both the CIA (In-Q-Tel) and Google (Google Ventures) were investing in Recorded Future, a company specializing in predictive analytics‚Äîmonitoring the web in real time and using that information to predict the future. And, while private corporations have been using similar systems since the 1990s, the involvement of Google and the CIA with their large data stores raised privacy concerns.\\"Google and CIA Invest in a Minority Report-Like Technology That May Make Our World a Less Certain Place\\", Bob Jacobson, Huffington Post, July 30, 2010 In 2011, a federal district court judge in the United States turned down a Freedom of Information Act request, submitted by the Electronic Privacy Information Center. In May 2012, a Court of Appeals upheld the ruling. The request attempted to disclose NSA records regarding the 2010 cyber-attack on Google users in China. The NSA stated that revealing such information would make the US Government information systems vulnerable to attack. The NSA refused to confirm or deny the existence of the records, or the existence of any relationship between the NSA and Google. Leaked NSA documents obtained by The Guardian and The Washington Post in June 2013 included Google on the list of companies that cooperate with the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Following the leak, government officials acknowledged the existence of the program. According to the leaked documents, the NSA has direct access to servers of those companies, and the amount of data collected through the program had been growing fast in years prior to the leak. Google has denied the existence of any \\"government backdoor\\". Government requests Google has been criticized both for disclosing too much information to governments too quickly and for not disclosing information that governments need to enforce their laws. In April 2010, Google, for the first time, released details about how often countries around the world ask it to hand over user data or to censor information.\\"Google reveals government data requests and censorship\\", Maggie Shiels, BBC News, April 20, 2010 Online tools make the updated data available to everyone.\\"Government Requests\\", Google Transparency Report, accessed January 28, 2019 Between July and December 2009, Brazil topped the list for user data requests with 3,663, while the US made 3,580, the UK 1,166, and India 1,061. Brazil also made the largest number of requests to remove content with 291, followed by Germany with 188, India with 142, and the US with 123. Google, who stopped offering search services in China a month before the data was released, said it could not release information on requests from the Chinese government because such information is regarded as a state secret. Google's chief legal officer said, \\"The vast majority of these requests are valid and the information needed is for legitimate criminal investigations or for the removal of child pornography\\". March 20, 2019 the U.S Supreme Court risked an 8.5 million settlement which Google formed to fix a lawsuit with the claims of invading their privacy.

Anyone with a Gmail account was automatically added as a contact to pre-existing Gmail contacts, and had to opt out if they did not wish to participate. The launch of Google Buzz as an \\"opt-out\\" social network immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users' contacts to view their other contacts.\\"Google's Buzz 'Has Serious Privacy Flaws'\\" , Roddy Mansfield, Sky News Online, February 12, 2010 In 2011, the United States Federal Trade Commission initiated a Commission proceeding against respondent Google, Inc., alleging that certain personal information of Gmail users was shared without consumers' permission through the Google Buzz social network. Real names, Google+, and Nymwars Google Plus (G+) was launched in late June 2011. The new service gained 20 million members in just a few weeks. At the time of launch, the site's user content and conduct policy stated, \\"To help fight spam and prevent fake profiles, use the name your friends, family or co-workers usually call you.\\" Starting in July 2011, Google began enforcing this policy by suspending the accounts of those who used pseudonyms. Starting in August 2011, Google provided a four-day grace period before enforcing the real name policy and suspending accounts. The four days allowed members time to change their pen name to their real name. The policy extends to new accounts for all of Google services, including Gmail and YouTube, although accounts existing before the new policy are not required to be updated. In late January 2012 Google began allowing members to use nicknames, maiden names, and other \\"established\\" names in addition to their common or real names.\\"In a Switch, Google Plus Now Allows Pseudonyms\\", Claire Cain Miller, New York Times, January 23, 2012. Retrieved October 3, 2013. According to Google, the real name policy makes Google more like the real world. People can find each other more easily, like a phone book. The real name policy protects children and young adults from cyber-bullying, as those bullies hide behind pen names. There is considerable use of search engines for people searchingA Spink, BJ Jansen, J Pedersen (2004) Searching for people on web search engines. Journal of Documentation 60 (3), 266-278. A number of high-profile commentators have publicly criticized Google's policies, including technologists Jamie Zawinski, Kevin Marks, and Robert Scoble and organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Criticisms have been wide-ranging,\\"Google's Real Names Policy Is Evil\\", Mat Honan, Gizmodo, August 12, 2011.

The policy prevents users from protecting themselves by hiding their identity. For example, a person who reports a human rights violation or crime and posts it on YouTube can no longer do so anonymously. The dangers include possible hate crimes, retaliation against whistle-blowers, executions of rebels, religious persecution, and revenge against victims or witnesses of crimes. * Using a pseudonym is different from anonymity, and a pseudonym used consistently denotes an \\"authentic personality\\". * Google's arguments fail to address the financial gain represented by connecting personal data to real- world identities. * Google has inconsistently enforced their policy, especially by making exceptions for celebrities using pseudonyms and mononyms. * The policy as stated is insufficient for preventing spam. * The policy may run afoul of legal constraints such as the German \\"Telemediengesetz\\" federal law, which makes anonymous access to online services a legal requirement.. * The policy does not prevent trolls. It is up to social media to encourage the growth of healthy social norms, and forcefully telling people how they must behave cannot be efficient. YouTube and Viacom On July 14, 2008, Viacom compromised to protect YouTube users' personal data in their $1 billion copyright lawsuit. Google agreed it will anonymize user information and internet protocol addresses from its YouTube subsidiary before handing the data over to Viacom. The privacy deal also applied to other litigants including the FA Premier League, the Rodgers & Hammerstein organization and the Scottish Premier League.\\"Lawyers in YouTube lawsuit reach user privacy deal\\", Eric Auchard, Reuters, July 15, 2008\\"Google and Viacom reach deal over YouTube user data\\", Mark Sweney, The Guardian, July 15, 2008 The deal however did not extend the anonymity to employees, because Viacom wishes to prove that Google staff are aware of the uploading of illegal material to the site. The parties therefore will further meet on the matter lest the data be made available to the court.\\"Viacom backs down over YouTube lawsuit\\", Fiona Ramsay, Media Week, July 15, 2008 Do Not Track In April 2011, Google was criticized for not signing onto the Do Not Track feature for Chrome that was being incorporated in most other modern web browsers, including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking through web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that do not track would hurt Google's ability to exploit this. Software reviewer Kurt Bakke of Conceivably Tech wrote: Mozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted: \\"It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame. I had hoped they'd demonstrate a bit more independence than that.\\" At the time of the criticisms, Google argued that the technology is useless, as advertisers are not required to obey the user's tracking preferences and it remains unclear as to what constitutes tracking (as opposed to storing statistical data or user preferences). As an alternative, Google continues to offer an extension called \\"Keep My Opt-Outs\\" that permanently prevents advertising companies from installing cookies on the user's computer. The reaction to this extension was mixed. Paul Thurrott of Windows IT Pro called the extension \\"much, much closer to what I've been asking for‚Äîi.e. something that just works and doesn't require the user to figure anything out‚Äîthan the IE or Firefox solutions\\" while lamenting the fact that the extension is not included as part of the browser itself. In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome will incorporate a Do Not Track feature by the end of 2012, and it was implemented in early November 2012. Moreover, P√≥l Mac and Douglas J. (2016) in their study ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Let Google Know I‚Äôm Lonely‚Äù, presented strong evidence that the two giant techs have very high accuracy while providing results based on user's sensitive entries. P√≥l Mac and Douglas J. (2016) specifically focused on user's financial and sexual preferences and they have concluded that \\"For Google, 100% of user sessions on a sensitive topic reject the hypothesis that no learning of the sensitive topic by the search engine has taken place and so are identified as sensitive. For Bing, the corresponding detection rate is 91%.\\" Scroogle 2008 screenshot of Scroogle.org. Scroogle, named after the fictional character Ebenezer Scrooge, was a web service that allowed users to perform Google searches anonymously. It focused heavily on searcher privacy by blocking Google cookies and not saving log files. The service was launched in 2003 by Google critic Daniel Brandt, who was concerned about Google collecting personal information on its users. Scroogle offered a web interface and browser plugins for Firefox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer that allowed users to run Google searches anonymously. The service scraped Google search results, removing ads and sponsored links. Only the raw search results were returned, meaning features such as page preview were not available. For added security, Scroogle gave users the option of having all communication between their computer and the search page be SSL encrypted. Although Scroogle's activities technically violated Google's terms of service, Google generally tolerated its existence, whitelisting the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running into a series of problems starting in 2010. In February 2012, the service was permanently shut down by its creator due to a combination of throttling of search requests by Google and a denial-of-service attack by an unknown person or group. Before its demise, Scroogle handled around 350,000 queries daily, (English translation). ranked among the top 4,000 sites worldwide and in the top 2500 for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries in web traffic. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) compliance Google has been criticized by some for the way it implements support for the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) because of its \\"biased\\" terms of service on YouTube and its \\"heavy- handed\\" ways of enforcing the law. According to Google's Privacy Policy, children under 13 aren't allowed to use any Google services, including Gmail. Privacy and data protection cases and issues by country European Union European Union (EU) data protection officials (the Article 29 working party who advise the EU on privacy policy) have written to Google asking the company to justify its policy of keeping information on individuals' internet searches for up to two years. The letter questioned whether Google has \\"fulfilled all the necessary requirements\\" on the EU laws concerning data protection.\\"EU probes Google grip on data\\", Maija Palmer, Financial Times, May 24, 2007 the probe by the EU into the data protection issue is continuing. On May 31, 2007, Google agreed that its privacy policy is vague, and that they are constantly working at making it clearer to users.\\"Google privacy policy 'is vague'\\", Darren Waters, BBC News, May 31, 2007 After Google merged its different privacy policies into a single one in March 2012, the working group of all European Union Data Protection Authorities assessed that it failed to comply with the EU legal framework. Several countries then opened cases to investigate possible breach of their privacy rules. Google has also been implicated in Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonz√°lez, a Spanish Audiencia Nacional and European Court of Justice case that decided Google must comply with the European privacy laws (i.e., the Data Protection Directive) and allow users to be forgotten when operating in the European Union. Czech Republic Starting in 2010, after more than five months of unsuccessful negotiations with Google, the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection has prevented Street View from taking pictures of new locations. The Office described Google's program as taking pictures \\"beyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street\\", and claimed that it \\"disproportionately invaded citizens' privacy.\\"\\"Czech Republic stops Google from further Street View photography\\", Cyrus Farivar (Reuters), Deutsche Welle, September 15, 2010\\"Czech Republic blocks Google's data mapping feature\\", J.G. Enriquez, Seer Press News, September 25, 2010 Google resumed Street View in Czech Republic in 2012 after having agreed to a number of limitations similar to concessions Google has made in other countries. France In January 2014, the French authority, CNIL, sanctioned Google to pay its highest fee and to display on its search engine web site a banner referring to the decision. Google complied, yet will appeal to the supreme court of administrative justice, the Conseil d'Etat. A number of French and German companies came together to form a group called the Open Internet Project, seeking a ban of Google's manipulative favoring of its own services and content over those of others. Germany In May 2010, Google was unable to meet a deadline set by Hamburg's data protection supervisor to hand over data illegally collected from unsecured home wireless networks. Google added, \\"We hope, given more time, to be able to resolve this difficult issue.\\"\\"Google refuses to give up 'illegal' data\\" , Press TV, May 27, 2010 The data was turned over to German, French, and Spanish authorities in early June 2010.\\"Google Relents, Will Hand Over European Wi-Fi Data\\", Robert McMillan, PC World/IDG News, June 3, 2010 In November 2010, vandals in Germany targeted houses that had opted out of Google's Street View.\\"German vandals target Street View opt-out homes\\", BBC News, November 24, 2010. In April 2011, Google announced that it will not expand its Street View program in Germany, but what has already been shot‚Äîaround 20 cities' worth of pictures‚Äîwill remain available. This decision came in spite of an earlier Berlin State Supreme Court ruling that Google's Street View program was legal. \\"Google Abandons Street View in Germany\\", David Murphy, PC Magazine, April 10, 2011 In September 2014, A top official in Germany called for Google to be broken up as publishers were fighting in court over compensation for the snippets of text that appear with Google News updates. The chief executive of Axel Springer, a German publishing giant, expressed fears over Google's growing influence in the country. Italy Google vs. Vividown: In February 2010, in a complaint brought by an Italian advocacy group for people with Down's Syndrome, Vividown, and the boy's father, three Google executives were handed six-month suspended sentences for breach of the Italian Personal Data Protection Code in relation to a video, uploaded to Google Video in 2006, of a disabled boy being bullied by several classmates.\\"Caso Google-Vividown: un bel saggio che deve far riflettere \\" (\\"Google case-Vividown: a good essay that should give pause\\"), Guido Scorza, May 16, 2010 (English translation)\\"The Italian Google-Case: Privacy, Freedom of Speech and Responsibility of Providers for User-Generated Contents\\", Giovanni Sartor and Mario Viola de Azevedo Cunha, International Journal of Law and Information Technology, Vol. 18 No. 4 (Winter 2010), pp. 356‚Äì378 In December 2012, these convictions and sentences were overturned on appeal. Norway The Data Inspectorate of Norway (Norway is not a member of the EU) investigated Google (and others) and stated that the 18- to 24-month period for retaining data proposed by Google was too long.\\"Google Data on Users May Break EU Law, Watchdog Says\\", Stephanie Bodoni, Bloomberg, May 25, 2007 United Kingdom On 27 March 2015, the Court of Appeal ruled that British consumers have the right to sue Google in the UK for misuse of private information.

March 17, 2006. Retrieved on April 13, 2007. In April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for \\"invasion of privacy\\". They claimed that Street View made a photo of their home available online, and it diminished the value of their house, which was purchased for its privacy. They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. \\"While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any other than the most exquisitely sensitive would suffer shame or humiliation,\\" Judge Hay ruled; the Boring family was paid one dollar by Google for the incident. In May 2010, a U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon ordered Google to hand over two copies of wireless data that the company's Street View program collected as it photographed neighborhoods. In 2012 and 2013, Google reached two settlements over tracking consumers online without their knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in Apple‚Äôs Safari browser. The first was settlement in August 2012 for $22.5 million with the Federal Trade Commission‚Äîthe largest civil penalty the F.T.C. has ever obtained for a violation of a Commission order. The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what cookies are and how to control them, and to ensure that the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. In both settlements Google denied any wrongdoing, but said it discontinued circumventing the settings early in 2012, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.\\"Google to Pay $17 Million to Settle Privacy Case\\", Claire Cain Miller, New York Times, November 18, 2013. Retrieved November 19, 2013. In September 2019, Google was fined $170 million by the Federal Trade Commission in New York for violation of COPPA regulations on its YouTube platform. YouTube was required to add a feature to allow content creators to flag videos made for users under 13 years old. Ads were prohibited in those videos. YouTube was also required to ask for parents' permission before collecting personal information from children.  DoubleClick ads combined with other Google services  In the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it \\"may\\" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the Activity controls in the My Account page of a Google account. ProPublica states that \\"The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct.\\" Google contacted ProPublica to correct the fact that it doesn't \\"currently\\" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.

Early life and education  Born into a family of architects, design was prevalent in Maya's life from the start to the extent that she never even thought about going in any other direction besides art. At age 15, she submitted to the Niko Nikoladze College and later the Tbilisi State Academy of the Arts. In the 1990s she lived in the Netherlands for a year and studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy.  Style  Maya does not consider herself to have one style or one direction within the sphere of art as she claims \\"it all interests her\\". She works in graphic design as well as paintings and often received requests and order for the production of each. She has worked on projects ranging from wallpaper design for interiors, to book design, illustrations for magazines, cards, posters, calendars, bank cards and more.

The imposing column (Tors√§ule means \\"gateway column\\"), which bears a summit cross, lies immediately north of the ascent route to the Hochk√∂nig from the Arthurhaus, a thousand metres below, and measures about 500 √ó 200 metres at its base. In an east-west direction it looks like a giant column, but on reaching the high plateau of the √úbergossene Alm it slowly disappears below the local horizon. Its south face which tapers towards the top is almost vertical, whilst the other faces have average gradients of about 60 to 80¬∞. Structurally, the Tors√§ule rises in front of the mountain ridge which the high plateau of the Hochk√∂nig massif and its plateau glacier bound on the eastern side and which opens like a rock arena in a semi-circle facing the column and looking towards the Salzach valley. The Tors√§ule rises, as the crow flies, roughly between the eastern top of the Schoberk√∂pfe (2,666 and 2,708 m) and the K√∂nigs- and Bratschenk√∂pfe (2,630 to 2,857 m). On the other side (north- facing) it drops down to the Eiskar, beyond which the Teufelskirche mountain and cave lie on the steep slopes of the Schoberk√∂pfe.

Design The Class 940 was designed for the Appennine mountains railways, and especially for the Rome-Sulmona-Pescara line, an important coast-to-coast railway that presented steep gradients (up to 2.7%); until then those had been served by 0-6-0 locomotives such as the FS Class 851, that had become inadequate for the increasing needs. Therefore, it was decided to build a locomotive with eight driving wheels, by adapting the frames, the boiler and the engine of the Class 740 to a tank design, also adding a trailing wheel to the wheelbase to enable the new design to run well backwards as well as forwards. The locomotives were built from 1922 to 1924 by the Officine Meccaniche, Reggiane and the Officine Meccaniche e Navali di Napoli, for a total of 50.Cornol√≤, p. 532-3Kalla-Bishop, p. 96 Service and modifications Initially, most of the class was allocated to the Sulmona shed for service on the trans-appennine railway; after World War II (in which four locomotives ended up remaining in Yugoslavian territory, and being taken up by the Yugoslav Railways as J≈Ω 118 001-4), the Class was dispersed in many sheds throughout Italy. Since 1968 improved draughting and a larger chimney were fitted. In 1951 three locomotives identical to the Class 940 but built in 1924 for the ', numbered 941‚Äì943, were taken over by the FS, when the company was absorbed, and were given the running numbers from 940.051 to 940.053, therefore bringing to 53 the nominal total for the class. The Class 940 was a successful design, that remained in service till the end of regular steam services on the FS network, mostly for freight service but also for passenger trains and heavy shunting duties.Cornol√≤, p. 533-7Kalla-Bishop, ibidem Preservation Eighteen Class 940 survived into preservation; currently, only the 041 and the 006 are operational and available for heritage trains, while others (such as the 022 and the 036) are undergoing maintenance.

Prozac was introduced in 1988, and has been the world's leading antidepressant. Early life He was born in Broughty Ferry, in the east of Dundee. He received a BSc degree in Chemistry in 1960 from the University of St Andrews, gaining a PhD in 1963. Career He moved to the US in 1963, working on research at three universities for three years, including Imperial College London. He researched the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and its effect on the heart. Mechanism of prozac Prozac He worked with David T. Wong and Klaus Schmiegel. Tricyclic antidepressants had been introduced in the 1950s, and further antidepressants included monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs); these had side-effects. In 1971, Wong and Molloy went to a lecture in Indianapolis given by Solomon H. Snyder, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University. This gave them a method to test new compounds similar to antihistamines found by Molloy, one being fluoxetine. Fluoxetine hydrochloride (3-aryloxy-3-phenylpropylamine, an aryloxyphenylpropylamine), the first of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), was discovered in 1972, and made public in 1974; work had begun with Robert Rathbun in 1970. Other well- known SSRIs would be sertraline (Zoloft) from Pfizer, and paroxetine (Paxil or Seroxat) from GSK. Fluoxetine is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. He later worked on cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmia, and phenethylamines as antidepressants. He retired in 2001. Personal life He married Kay Koch in 1971.

Background Kealoha Pisciotta, at a hearing for the proposed Thirty Meter Telescope Hawaiian cultural organizations have objected to the observatories on Mauna Kea as sacrilegious, spoiling their god's home and destroying the shrines of Hawaiian families. MKAH was founded by Kealoha Pisciotta, a former systems specialist for the joint British-Dutch-Canadian James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, who became concerned that a stone family shrine she had built for her grandmother and family, years earlier, had been removed and found at a dump. The shrine was removed by a tour guide from the University of Hawai'i's Institute for Astronomy. Pisciotta stated in 2002 that the group was a \\"Native Hawaiian organization cultural and lineal descendants, and traditional, spiritual and religious practitioners of the sacred traditions of Mauna Kea.\\" It is described as an organization of Hawaiian cultural practitioners. While many in opposition of the observatories call for a complete removal of all telescopes from the mountain, Pisciotta and her groups support less extreme action. The issue of cultural rights on the mountain was the focus of the documentary: \\"Mauna Kea ‚Äî Temple Under Siege\\" which aired on PBS in 2006 and featured Kealoha Pisciotta. The Hawaii State Constitution guarantees the religious and cultural rights of Native Hawaiians. Many of the state of Hawaii's laws can be traced back to Kingdom of Hawaii law. Hawai\`i Revised Statute ¬ß 1-1 codifies Hawaiian custom and gives deference to native traditions. In the early 1970s, managers of Mauna Kea did not seem to pay much attention to complaints of Native Hawaiians about the sacred nature of the mountain. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou, the Royal Order of Kamehameha I and the Sierra Club, united their opposition to the Keck's proposal of adding six addition outrigger telescopes. In 2003 MKAH sponsored a photography exhibit along with the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, Kahakamaoli Religious Institute, Makaainana Foundation and the Sacred Mountain Society, all Native Hawaiian groups that strongly believe Mauna kea to be a sacred place. Due to a lack of cultural sensitivity with expansion of the observatories, the groups built an altar in 1998 at the summit of the mountain and conduct solstice and equinox ceremonies each year. Keck opposition In 2004, the group spoke against an environmental study that came out in favor of an expansion to the Keck telescope, called outrigger. Development of the Mauna kea observatories is still opposed by environmental groups and Native Hawaiians. A 2006 proposal for the Outrigger Telescopes to become extensions of the Keck Observatory was canceled after a judge's determination that a full environmental impact statement must be prepared before any further development of the site. The \\"outrigger\\" would have linked the Keck I and Keck II telescopes. Environmental groups and Native Hawaiian activist were a lot stronger at this time than in the past but NASA went ahead with the proposal for lack of an alternate site. The group Mauna Kea Anaina Hou made several arguments against the development including that Mauna Kea was a sacred mountain to Native Hawaiians where many deities lived and that the cinder cone being proposed was holy in Hawaiian tradition as a burial site for a demi-god. The group raised several other concerns such as environmental over native insects, the question of Ceded lands and an audit report, critical of the mountains management. The case was handled pro bono by a team including L. Hong who, in 2005, won an award for working to protect Hawaiian land and culture. TMT opposition Mauna Kea Hui gained the support of Hollywood actors, Jason Momoa and Kala Alexandra as well as surfer and politician, Dustin Barca in 2015. On April 17, 2015 Governor David Ige announced a temporary halt to construction of the TMT. Mauna Kea Hui thanked the governor of Hawaii and his staff in an official statement. After the arrests of 31 people blocking the road to Mauna Kea in April 2015, MKH stated; \\"There are no words‚Ä¶ we are deeply deeply saddened by the arrests today of our Hawaiian brothers and sisters and other citizens who were peacefully protecting Mauna Kea from further desecration while we wait for Hawai ªi‚Äôs courts to hear our appeal.\\".. In 2015 MKH sent a letter to the Hawaii attorney general relating to access of the mountain being limited to observatory employees and their crews. The group was one of several parties to win revocation of the Thirty Meter Telescope permit in 2015. MKAH made national headlines in 2015 for their lawsuit relating to their protest of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea, on the Island of Hawaii. The Canadian group Idle No More expressed support for Mauna Kea Anaina Hou. Another group that has supported MKAH's efforts is the Sierra Club of Hawaii.

In June 2016, Kodak Black was named one of XXL magazine's \\"2016 Freshman Class\\". In August 2016, Kodak Black was criticized when a studio session video was released showing him ridiculing dark-skinned black women with lyrics which implied those women were less attractive than light-skinned black women, which is considered a type of misogynoir‚Äîanti-Black hatred towards women. In 2016, Kodak Black released the song \\"Can I\\" while he was in jail. On February 17, 2017, Kodak Black released the single \\"Tunnel Vision\\".https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/tunnel-vision- single/id1204526233 The song debuted at number 27 and peaked at number 6, becoming Kodak Black's first top 10 hit on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 17 on the Canadian Hot 100.

Musical style Kodak Black's music is frequently about \\"previous and future criminal misdeeds\\", and he stated that he's been influenced by rappers Boosie Badazz and Chief Keef. The New Yorker described his \\"manifestly youthful voice\\" and \\"mutinous sound\\", and stated \\"Kapri joins other young rappers who have rejected an old-school emphasis on lyrical variety, individualism, and personal catharsis\\". In 2016, The Fader wrote that he \\"articulates the constant state of affliction that living in a poverty-stricken environment can mean. He makes emotionally intelligent observations in a manner reminiscent of teenage artists of the '90s, such as Mobb Deep and Lil' Wayne, whose voices were valued as genuine illustrations of life in their corners of America.\\" Kodak Black has been frequently described as a mumble rapper. Personal life In 2014, Kodak Black stated that he was working towards his high school diploma at Blanche Ely High School in Pompano Beach. During his incarceration, Kodak Black began to identify as a Hebrew Israelite after a priest who conducts prison ministry studied scripture with him. He later filed to change his name to Bill Kahan Blanco, with Kahan supposedly being an alternative spelling of kohen, a term used in Judaism to refer to priests who descend from the prophet Aaron, the brother of Moses. On May 2, 2018, he legally changed his name from \\"Dieuson Octave\\" to \\"Bill K. Kapri\\". In June 2018, Kodak Black earned his GED while in jail.

On May 3, 2019, Kodak Black donated $12,500 to a girl named Paige Cook, the girl's goal was to give pencils and notebooks to give to all 7,600 students in the Cleburne Independent School District in Texas, a low-income district. In 2018, Paige raised enough money to buy over 40,000 pencils. In the wake of the 2019 Colorado STEM shooting, Kodak Black's lawyer reached out the family of Kendrick Ray Castillo, who was shot and killed after lunging at the attacker, on May 11, and offered to pay for Castillo's funeral, and set aside an annual $10,000 scholarship for any student wishing to go to college for science or engineering. His lawyer stated that the family had not yet responded. Kodak also allegedly donated $50,000 to Gekyume, the son of late rapper and collaborator XXXTentacion. Kodak and XXXTentacion were friends up until his murder in 2018.  Controversies  In January 2017, Kodak Black broadcast an Instagram Live video of himself in a Washington, D.C. hotel room with several other men, while a lone female performed oral sex on them. Kodak Black's Instagram account hit a record high during the broadcast. The rapper later posted a message on Twitter about the incident reading \\"If I could change I swear I would .. I tried everything but I'm just so hood.\\" In June 2017, he wrote on Instagram about his preference for light-skinned women over those with dark skin. He also stated in an interview that actress Keke Palmer was \\"straight\\", but that he \\"don't really like Black girls like that\\". Some Twitter users responded negatively, provoking Kodak Black to delete both his Instagram and Twitter accounts. Kodak Black also stated that light-skinned women are easier to break down, black women are \\"too gutter\\", and that he does not like his own skin complexion. In April 2019, he garnered controversy when he offered to \\"wait\\" to have sexual relations with Lauren London, the girlfriend of late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was shot and killed a few days beforehand. Kodak Black said he would \\"give her a whole year\\" if she \\"might need a whole year to be crying and shit for him.\\" He received immediate backlash for these comments. Justin Credible, a DJ for the radio station Power 106 announced that the station would be boycotting Kodak Black's music. Credible said \\"We stand with the family of Nipsey Hussle and are appalled by the disrespectful and poor comments made by Kodak Black.\\" Fellow rappers T.I. and The Game also responded, with T.I. saying \\"You outta pocket nigga,\\" in a video recorded for Kodak Black. On April 7, Kodak Black responded, saying \\"If I disrespected you Lauren London in any shape or form, I am sorry. Even though I didn't.\\"  Legal issues  2015‚Äì2017 Kodak Black's mugshot in May 2016 Kodak Black was placed into a youth detention center three times in one year, and then placed on probation. In October 2015, he was arrested in Pompano Beach and charged with robbery, battery, false imprisonment of a child, and possession of cannabis. He was later released. In April 2016, Kodak Black was arrested in Hallandale Beach, Florida and charged with possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, possession of marijuana, and fleeing from officers. The following month of May 2016, he was arrested in Broward County, Florida and charged with armed robbery and false imprisonment. He was detained in custody. In August 2016, he appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Several executives from Atlantic Records attended the court; vice-president Michael Kushner commented \\"Black has a bright future as a recording artist\\". Kodak Black pleaded no contest to all charges and under a plea agreement was to be placed on house arrest for one year, have five years' probation, perform community service as required, and take anger management classes. He would also be permitted to tour internationally. Prior to his release from Broward Main Jail, police discovered two outstanding criminal warrants, the first from Florence, South Carolina alleging felony criminal sexual conduct, the second from St. Lucie County, Florida alleging two counts of misdemeanor marijuana possession. Kodak Black was not released from jail. In September 2016, Kodak Black pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor drug charges and was sentenced to four months in jail. He was credited for time spent in custody awaiting trial and was required to serve 120 days. He was also suspended from driving for one year. Kodak Black was released from jail in Florida, and was then transported to Florence, South Carolina to face charges of sexual assault. According to the female victim, who reported the incident to her school nurse, she had attended a February 2016 performance by Kodak Black at \\"Treasure City\\" in Florence, after which she accompanied him to his hotel room where he is alleged to have told her he \\"couldn't help himself\\" as he tore off her clothes, bit her repeatedly, and raped her as she screamed for help. Kodak Black was released from custody in South Carolina on December 1, 2016 after posting a $100,000 bond, but returned to court on February 8, 2017. About Kodak Black, the Miami New Times asked \\"is he the product of larger societal problems, having been raised on a steady diet of misogynistic rap lyrics?\\" Within hours of release, he recorded and released \\"There He Go\\", a single which mentions his recent release from jail: > Just hopped off the plane I just got out about a day ago Everybody love me, > when they see me they be like, \\"There he go!\\" Got me a new lady, we 'bout to > take a trip to Mexico Crackers took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco > (an AK-47 rifle) In February 2017, Kodak Black was arrested again for violation of his probation. He was held without bond and his musical tour was postponed. In April 2017, Kodak Black was indicted by a grand jury in South Carolina, and was scheduled to go on trial in April 2019 in Florence, South Carolina on a charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. This was later postponed. Also in April 2017, he appeared in court in Florida, where his anger management counselor Ramona Sanchez spoke about him disrupting her class. Sanchez said he was constantly burping during her class, and when asked to leave, he refused. When Sanchez threatened to call 911, he grabbed her phone and her wrist. The counselor recommended that Kodak Black participate in individual therapy instead of group therapy. On May 4, 2017, he was sentenced for violating his house arrest to 364 days in the Broward County Jail, with the possibility of an early release if he completes a life skills course. He was released on June 5, 2017. He will remain on house arrest for one year, and five years of probation. 2018-present Kodak Black was arrested inside of his Pembroke Pines, Florida home in January 2018 on multiple charges stemming from an Instagram live-feed video showing him passing marijuana and a gun around a small child. He initially faced seven felony charges including child neglect, grand theft of a firearm, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and marijuana possession. On February 22, 2018, three charges against Kodak Black were dropped and he pleaded not guilty to the remaining two. On April 17, he pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of marijuana, and was sentenced to 364 days in prison with credit for time served. He was released on August 18, 2018. While on tour in the Southeast, a South Carolinian Prosecutor announced that Kodak Black would be facing trial for first degree criminal sexual conduct for the alleged rape in February 2016. The prosecutor said that in the summer or early fall, Kodak Black would have to return to South Carolina and face trial for the charges. They stated he faces a maximum of 30 years in prison. 12 Circuit Solicitor Ed Clements stated \\"We are slowly but steadily moving toward a disposition.\\" There was also reportedly a number of lesser, related charges. The office of the prosecutor stated the victim was not a minor at the time of the alleged rape. This was never followed through and Kodak Black is still awaiting trial for the charge. As of April 5, 2019, a concert promoter filed a lawsuit against Kodak Black for failing to appear at his concerts. Nicholas Fitts‚Äîthe promoter‚Äîclaims that Kodak Black was contractually obliged to perform for him on March 3, 2017 in New York, but did not show up. Fitts then rescheduled it for April 2017, and Kodak Black failed to appear once more. Then on a third makeup date, Kodak Black once more failed to appear. Fitts stated that the incident caused him over $500,000 in losses and hurt his reputation. His lawsuit was suing for over $500,000. While trying to re-enter the United States from Canada on April 17, 2019, Kodak Black was arrested by United States' Borders and Customs Protections after border authorities found weed and a Glock in his car. He was charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, and unlawful possession of marijuana by authorities. Bail was set at either $40,000 or $20,000, he was released on the 18th. As a result of the arrest, a performance in Boston and a performance in Connecticut was cancelled. Late on April 24, 2019, while on tour for his most recent album, Dying to Live, and while performing at a venue, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Metropolitan police entered and searched one of Kodak Black's tour buses parked at the venue. While Kodak Black was not in the vehicle at the time, the FBI found weapons in the vehicle and detained a few of Kodak Black's crew members. Allegedly, the FBI attempted to enter the club in which Kodak Black was performing, but denied entry by the owner. TMZ stated it was \\"unclear\\" whether or not the bus was actually owned by Kodak Black. This came a week after his arrest at the U.S.-Canada border. It was stated Kodak Black himself did not get in trouble with law enforcement. On May 11, 2019, while preparing to perform at Rolling Loud Miami, Kodak Black was arrested on firearm charges before he could perform. He was arrested by Miami PD and Federal Officers, and is facing state and federal charges. This was nearly a month after he was arrested while entering the United States from Canada. Kodak Black was charged with two counts of making a false statement on a governmental form, this apparently stems from January 2019, when he lied on a form while attempting to purchase firearms. He filed to use his $600,000 home as collateral for his $500,000 bond for the indictments and was granted the bond, being released. He reportedly faces up to 10 years in prison on the charges, and plead not guilty on May 15. Federal prosecutors, however, are attempting to revoke Kodak Black's bail, pointing to past violent crimes, such as a 2012 carjacking incident, and his possible connections to a shooting in March. The new arrest may also cause his bond in the 2016 South Carolina rape case to be revoked. Federal prosecutors stated that he is a danger to society due to his long history of criminal acts as well as his repeated violation of past probation rules. Kodak Black's lawyer stated that he voluntarily turned himself in upon hearing of a warrant, and is not a danger to society due to the crime being non-violent. It was reported by TMZ on November 13, 2019 that Kodak Black had taken a plea bargain and had been sentenced to 46 months in prison, a drastically shorter sentence than the 96 months that the courts had been considering as the rapper had been involved in a fight while incarcerated that involved injury to a prison guard. On March 11, 2020, Kodak Black plead guilty to a firearms possession case he was charged with after being detained at the Canadian-American border with a Glock. With sentencing set for March 24, the court is considering between 2 and 7 years in prison, which will run concurrently with his 46-month sentencing for lying on federal paperwork. As of June 2020, Kodak Black is serving his federal sentence at United States Penitentiary, Big Sandy, a high-security prison in Inez, Kentucky. He is serving his sentence under the name Bill K Kapri (BOP# 18149-104).

The quilt includes a collection of survivors' stories stitched, written, and painted onto red fabric. The quilt The quilt includes over 3,000 stories by rape and abuse survivors and incorporates the stories of those who have experienced gender- based violence. The quilt was constructed over six years as organizers traveled to 49 states and 33 cities in the U.S. and Mexico, where parts of the quilt were displayed. Visitors were invited to share their stories on designated blank squares when the quilt was on display. The project culminated in a display of the entire quilt on National Mall in Washington, D.C., from May 31 to June 2, 2019. The quilt was constructed to read ‚ÄúNot Alone‚Äù and a Spanish translation, ‚ÄúNo Est√°s Solx.‚Äù The project's organizers paid special attention to the inclusion of stories from survivors in marginalized communities: women of color, trans and gender non-conforming folks, sex workers, First Nation communities, and child sexual abuse survivors. One of the project leaders, Liz Ensz, explained in an interview that the multiplicity of narratives was a driving force for the Monument Quilt: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about presenting these other narratives that men can be survivors of rape and sexual assault, women can be perpetrators, any story can exist. There‚Äôs not just one narrative.‚Äù History The idea for the quilt originated with Rebecca Nagle and Hannah Brancato, artists based in Baltimore, Maryland. Having seen research that showed how public monuments, such as memorials for war veterans, could help survivors recover from trauma, they set out to create a monument for the survivors of rape. They co-founded and co-direct the arts and activist organization FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture. As a call to create a permanent monument, FORCE coordinated the installation of temporary monuments to rape and abuse survivors on the National Mall in Washington D.C. Their first \\"guerilla monument\\" in 2013 involved floating lines from a poem in the form of giant, red styrofoam letters on the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The poem's lines read \\"I CAN'T FORGET WHAT HAPPENED BUT NO ONE ELSE REMEMBERS\\". FORCE partnered with public safety organizations and community-based prevention groups who held quilt-making workshops and displayed portions of the quilt in public spaces. The quilt toured the United States in the summer of 2014. Starting at Arden, North Carolina, the quilt traveled to 13 cities. In June 2015, the Monument Quilt was awarded part of the PNC Transformative Art Prize a $30,000 grant for display of the quilt in the autumn.

There is no evidence that any non-human animals believe in God or gods, pray, worship, have any notion of metaphysics, create artifacts with ritual significance, or many other behaviours typical of human religion. Whether animals can have religious faith is dependent on a sufficiently open definition of religion. Thus, if by religion one means a \\"non-anthropocentric, non-anthropomorphic, non-theistic, and non-logocentric trans-species prototype definition of religion\\",Harrod JB. (2014). \\"The Case for Chimpanzee Religion\\" Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture (8.1) ritual behaviour can be interpreted in the actions of chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins and other animals. The study of proto-religions in modern animals is relevant to the study of the development of religion in modern humans and their recent ancestors. Ritual behaviour in apes Theologian and biologist Oliver Putz notes that, since chimpanzees are capable of moral agency, it is possible for Christians to understand them as having been made in the image of God.Putz O (2009). \\"Social Apes in God's Image: Moral Apes, Human Uniqueness, and the Image of God\\" Journal of Religion and Science, August Furthermore, Nancy R. Howell suggests that \\"chimpanzees and bonobos may have the precursors for culture and spirituality, such as connectedness, interdependence and sociality' and a level of 'symbolic capacity'\\".Harrod JB. (2014). \\"The Case for Chimpanzee Religion\\" Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture (8.1) Primatologist Jane Goodall goes further, noting that some chimpanzees may \\"dance\\" at the onset of heavy rain or when they come across a waterfall. She speculates that \\"their 'elemental'\\" displays are precursors of religious ritual.\\"Goodall J () \\"Primate spirituality\\" The Encyclopaedia of Religion and Nature. edited by B. Taylor. Thoemmes Continuum, New York. Pp. 1303-1306 Ritual behaviour in elephants Ronald K. Siegel has studied the precursors of religious faith in African elephants and concludes that \\"elephants are aware of natural cycles, as they practice \\"moon worship,\\" waving branches at the waxing moon and engaging in ritual bathing when the moon is full.\\"Siegel RK (1980). \\"The Psychology of Life After Death\\" American Psychologist, Vol. 35(10), October pp.911-931 Observations by Pliny the Elder also note supposed elephant reverence for the celestial bodies.\\"The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon.\\" Pliny, Natural History (VIII.1) Funeral rites in animals While grief is common to many animals, funeral rituals are not. However, they are well documented in African elephants.Bekoff M (2009). \\"Grief in Animals\\" Psychology Today, October Ronald K. Siegel writes that: \\"...one cannot ignore the elaborate burying behaviour of elephants as a similar sign of ritualistic or even religious behaviour in that species. When encountering dead animals, elephants will often bury them with mud, earth and leaves. Animals known to have been buried by elephants include rhinos, buffalos, cows, calves, and even humans, in addition to elephants themselves. Elephants have [been] observed burying their dead with large quantities of food fruit, flowers and colourful foliage.\\"Siegel RK (1980). \\"The Psychology of Life After Death\\" American Psychologist, Vol. 35(10), October pp.911-931 Both wild and captive chimpanzees engage in ritualized behaviors at the death of a group member. These behaviors begin with group or individual silence, which may last for hours and followed by behaviors such as distinctive vocalizations; grooming the corpse; solemn visitation and gazing at the corpse by group members; displays; and lamentation-like whimpers or hoo-calls of distress. Attention to the dead is not unique to elephants or chimpanzees. Dolphins have been known to stay with recently deceased members of their pod for several days, preventing divers from getting close.Ritter F (2007). \\"Behaviour Responses of Rough-toothed Dolphins to a Dead Newborn Calf\\" Marine Mammal Science April pp.429-433 However, the reasons for this remain obscure. While scientists can observe their actions, the thought processes that motivate them are beyond current study.Dudzinski KM; Sakai M; Masaki K; Kogi K; Hishii T; Kurimoto M (2003). \\"Behavioural Observations of Bottle Nose Dolphins Towards Two Dead Conspecifics\\" Aquatic Mammals 29.1, pp.108-116 Relevance to the study of early modern humans The ritual lives of animals are of interest to paleoanthropologists, as they provide a convenient insight into how religious belief systems may have developed in our ancestors. \\"The skeletal remains of Cro-Magnon man are found buried in the foetal position in line with the primitive myth that such a position facilitates rebirth. The study of allied behaviours in non-human animals provides an opportunity to understand their nature and function in man.\\"Siegal RK (1981). \\"Accounting for 'Afterlife' Experiences\\" Psychology Today, January p.4 Indeed, some have seen superficial similarities between the funeral rituals of African elephants and the burial rituals of Neanderthals.Sapolsky, Robert M. (2006) Monkeyluv: And other Essays on Our Lives as Animals. Scribner Book Co. p.189 . Evolutionary psychologist Matt Rossano has theorised that religion evolved in three stages: In the pre-Upper Palaeolithic, religion was characterised by ecstatic rituals used to facilitate social bonding. Later, shamanic healing rituals developed in the Upper Palaeolithic. Finally, religious expressions developed over time to include cave art, ritual artefacts, ancestor worship and the development of myth and moral structures.Rossano MJ (2006). \\"The Religious Mind and the Evolution of Religion\\" Review of General Psychology, Vol 10(4) December pp346-364 If this is true then the behaviour of chimpanzees witnessed by Goodall may be interpreted as similar to pre-Upper Palaeolithic Human religion. However, De Waal notes that bonobos show no evidence of ritual behaviour yet are extremely peaceful and demonstrate moral agency. This casts doubt on the co-development of morality and proto-religion.De Waal, Frans (2013) The Bonobo and the Atheist. W.W.

It is one of a ring of forts surrounding Antwerp, built after the city had been identified as Belgium's National redoubt (final stronghold) to which the army and government could retreat and await allied intervention in the event of military attack from abroad. It is constructed of reinforced concrete with a trapezoidal footprint, and surrounded by a moat, which here forms a part of the Antitank canal constructed between 1937 and 1939. Together with the Fort of Sint- Katelijne-Waver (to the south of the city) the Fort of Stabroek was one of the first two \\"armoured forts\\" in Antwerp, intended to withstand shells of up to 22 cm. Construction, mandated in 1900, progressed only with delays, starting in 1902. The fort was completed in 1907 or 1908. However, it never received the heavy artillery pieces which had been intended for it, and by the time war did break out, in 1914, attack came not from France but from Germany, and the Germans were using artillery shells of 30.5 cm or, in the case of the so- called Big Bertha guns, of 42 cm. Before construction could start, 9 people had to be dispossessed of land, but the overall impact of the construction project was nevertheless overwhelmingly positive. Many Wallonian guest workers were brought in from Geldenaken, providing welcome additional income for caterers and other local businesses. During excavations in preparation for the construction three former river channels were identified, which were featured in a series of articles produced by Georges Hasse on the history of the rivers in the northern part of the province. Stabroek is a \\"second order\\" fort incorporating two semi-detached caponiers. Because these are not directly beside the main part of the fort, the linking trenches are protected with two little supplementary 5.7 cm gun turrets. All together there were one turret for two 15 cm guns, two each for a 12 cm Howitzers and four for 7.5 cm guns. The outbreak of the First World War involved a German invasion of Belgium, and two months later the German army began to besiege Antwerp. The intense fighting mostly took place on the south and eastern side of the city, and it is evident that the National redoubt of fortresses surrounding Antwerp held up the German invasion. Nevertheless, on 7 October 1914 the king gave orders to evacuate the Fort of Stabroek, and the fighting moved on towards the coast in the west. Just over a quarter century later Belgium faced another overwhelming German invasion, following the outbreak of the Second World War. Defensive preparations during the late 1930s had included the creation of an Antitank canal round Antwerp, of which the moat round the Fort of Stabroek formed a part. In the event, however, May 1940 marked the start of another four years of German military occupation. A couple of years after the war ended, formally in May 1945, on 2 April 1947 the Fort of Stabroek formally lost its military status, less than half a century after its construction. In 1955 it was sold to a dentist from Beveren called Albert Callens. The structure was initially used as a private country retreat, and later for growing mushrooms. The moat was used for recreational purposes such as fishing and swimming. The basic fabric remains sound, and following recent upgrades the Fort of Stabroek, now run by the dentist's grandson, offers recreational activities that include fort climbing and paint balling.

It was released by Atlantic Records on April 29, 1999 as the fourth and final single from their second studio album, Apartment Life (1997). The single was made available exclusively in Europe and featured the same two B-sides as previous single, \\"This Is the Day\\", which had been released by 550 Music in Austria. The track was written by Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase while production was handled by the latter two and Peter Nashel. Released alongside \\"This Is the Day\\", \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" received promotion by Atlantic Records after the former track was included on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, There's Something About Mary. The recording received generally favorable reviews from music critics who compared the song to the works of Irish rock group My Bloody Valentine.  Background and composition  \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" was written by Ivy band members Dominique Durand, Adam Schlesinger and Andy Chase. The production of the track was handled by Chase and Schlesinger, with additional production provided by Peter Nashel. Musically, \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" is a pop rock/indie rock song, also incorporating elements of indie pop and guitar accords. Lyrically, the song discusses a lover being \\"clueless\\" and \\"in the wrong\\". The single was heavily compared to My Bloody Valentine; in their review of the track, Sputnikmusic stated that it \\"comes off like a My Bloody Valentine song with intelligible vocals, with a sliding, reverb heavy hook and pummeling drums\\", while AllMusic writer Jack Rabid drew similar comparisons. Patrick Carmosino of West Net stated that with \\"You Don't Know Anything\\", Ivy \\"have an indie-ethic rock side that compliments their pop sensibilities to the tee\\".  Release  The recording was released simultaneously with the release of the single \\"This Is the Day\\"; this occurred after the latter track was featured in the 1998 film, There's Something About Mary. \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" was released as a CD single exclusively in European countries; the CD included two B-side tracks, \\"Sleeping Late\\" and \\"Sweet Mary\\".  Critical reception  \\"You Don't Know Anything\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club praised the track and Apartment Life for \\"sound[ing] slickly pretty and mannered\\". AllMusic named the song \\"a knockout\\" and praised it for allowing \\"the guitars [to] get mean\\".

Background and composition  In 1994, Ivy formed in New York City following a meeting between Andy Chase and French-native Dominique Durand. After acquiring musician Adam Schlesinger, they recorded several songs which would later appear on their first extended play (EP), Lately (1994). They also recorded the track \\"Get Enough\\", which became their debut single and also appeared on their first album. \\"Beautiful\\" is taken from Realistic, the trio's debut album which was released through Seed Records in 1995. The track was written and produced by Schlesinger and Chase, while production was handled by them in addition to Kurt Ralske. It was recorded in 1994 during sessions for Realistic held at Zabriskie Point recording studios in New York City.

During the concerts, they toured with several musicians, including Lloyd Cole and Edwyn Collins.

He was President of the Young Liberal Movement of NSW from 1992 to 1993.Young Liberals. Retrieved 10 October 2013. Zimmerman was a councillor on North Sydney Council for two terms until the local government elections of 2012. During his time as a councillor, Zimmerman lived openly as a gay man and worked actively on LGBTI issues, describing the de-funding of the NorthAIDS program as \\"unforgivable\\". He also served as Vice President of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Business Association. In the September 2008 Council Elections, Zimmerman ran for the position of Mayor of North Sydney, against the long-serving incumbent since 1995, Genia McCaffery. He was unsuccessful, taking only 40% of the vote, and later commented that \\"I worked very hard at it and I have no qualms at the issues I raised\\". During his time at Council, Zimmerman advocated on environmental issues around developments, including leading opposition to a controversial development in Vale Street, Cammeray. In 2012, Zimmerman was anointed as the Liberal left's candidate for the seat held by Jillian Skinner; but Skinner decided to stay on in parliament, deferring Zimmerman's political ambitions. Federal parliament Zimmerman won the 2015 North Sydney by-election with a 48.2 percent primary vote after a larger- than-predicted 12.8-point swing against the Liberals ‚àí more than triple that of the 2015 Canning by-election. It was only the second time since Federation that the Liberals (or their predecessors) did not obtain a majority of the primary vote.

The reduction of 5.7 points is not generally considered a \\"two-party/candidate preferred swing\\" ‚àí when a major party is absent, preference flows to both major parties does not take place, resulting in asymmetric preference flows.An Example of Non-Monotonicity and Opportunites [sic for Tactical Voting at an Australian Election: Antony Green ABC 4 May 2011] Zimmerman was preselected as the Liberal by-election candidate which was triggered by the resignation of former treasurer Joe Hockey. Zimmerman's appointment was controversial, with now-suspended party member Juris Laucis describing the process as \\"undemocratic\\" and \\"a stitch-up\\" and reform activist and former Liberal party member John Ruddick called for Liberal voters feeling disenfranchised to send a message to the party by giving Zimmerman their last preference. Political journalist Peter Hartcher attributed his preselection to his being an ally of Michael Photios, \\"the power behind the NSW machine\\". Whilst a candidate for preselection, Zimmerman was also the head of the body that sets the rules for party elections, a position his opponents described as a \\"complete conflict of interest.\\" Ted Mack, Hockey's predecessor in the seat, ran a campaign against Zimmerman on behalf of Stephen Ruff, the independent who ran second in the by-election. Zimmerman is one of eight openly LGBTI current members of the Parliament of Australia and the first openly LGBTI member of the House of Representatives. Zimmerman has indicated he will speak out on LGBTI issues and declared his support for gay marriage in Australia and stated \\"I would have supported a free vote and preferred it to be decided by the Parliament.

Biography  Janaina Tsch√§pe was born in 1973 in Munich, Germany, and was raised in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. She received her Bachelor in Fine Arts from the Hochschule f√ºr Bildende Kueste, Hamburg in 1997 and her Master in Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts in 1998. Tsch√§pe‚Äôs interdisciplinary practice spans painting, drawing, photography, video and sculpture. Incorporating elements of aquatic, plant, and human life, Tsch√§pe‚Äôs universe of sublime forms shift between representation, fantasy and abstraction. Her paintings exist in a state of their own becoming, linking the process of artistic practice to lifecycles found in nature. Each brushstroke partially occludes a previous mark; their physically sensuous surfaces give way to topologies of finely calibrated hues. In her performative photographic and video works, Tsch√§pe‚Äôs otherworldly creatures inhabit hybrid states of being. The female form is often pictured with ballooning appendages extending from the figure, sometimes overtaking her body to inhabit a fluid space between human and cellular organism. The artist explores different medias such as painting, drawing, photography, video and sculpture. The ocean, sea creatures, mermaids, half human creatures, are constantly being revisited by her imaginary, as well as invented landscapes. While in her earlier works Tsch√§pe often placed herself within the landscape, she now explores her memories, her inner-images, conjuring her travels and expeditions to a deeply-layered remembrance. Whether through her paintings and drawings, photography or films, Tsch√§pe reacts to her life experiences in an intense meditative contemplation of the landscape. Janaina Tsch√§pe‚Äôs work has been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout the world, and is included in numerous public and private collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna, Austria; Colec√£o Gilberto Chateaubriand MAM Museu de Art Moderna do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Collection Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sophia, Madrid, Spain. Recent projects include Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary; CCBB Rio de Janeiro; Jeu de Paume, Paris; University of South Florida Contemporary Art Museum, Tampa; The 59th Minute with Creative Time in Times Square, New York; Fotomuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; and The Irish Museum of Modern Art. The artist lives and works in New York since 1997. In 2013, Tsch√§pe collaborated with Brazilian jeweller Ara Vartanian on a jewellery collection.

Early life and education Matilda Kinnon was born in Victoria, British Columbia, the younger daughter of a Tlingit mother named Kut-Xoox, and a Scottish father named James Kinnon, who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company.Cherry Lyon Jones, \\"Matilda Kinnon 'Tillie' Paul Tamaree\\" in More Than Petticoats: Remarkable Alaska Women (Globe Pequot 2014): 11-20. When her mother fell ill with tuberculosis, she arranged to bring Tillie and her sister north to be raised by Tlingit relatives. Aided by a clansman, Kut-Xoox traveled by canoe with her two daughters along the Inside Passage, a journey of 600 miles. After her mother's death, young Tillie was raised by a maternal aunt, Xoon-sel-ut, and her uncle, Chief Snook of the Naanya.aayi, a clan of the Stikeen-quann, near Wrangell, Alaska. Her adoptive family gave her the name Kah-thli-yudt, soon shortened to \\"Kah-tah-ah.\\" Tillie lived in Wrangell until she was 12 years old, when she received a marriage proposal from a Christian Tsimishian chief, Abraham Lincoln. Her uncle consented to the marriage, but Tillie was ambivalent. They arranged that she would travel south to Lincoln's home in Prince Rupert, British Columbia with the understanding that no marriage would take place against her will. After her decision not to marry, when she was no longer under the care of the Tsimishian, she went to live with a Methodist minister and his wife, missionaries at Port Simpson, British Columbia. There, she relearned English and was schooled in Christian worship. Her family arranged for her return to Wrangell and she was admitted to Amanda McFarland's Presbyterian Home and School for Girls, where she started using the name \\"Tillie Kinnon.\\"  Teaching and missionary work  While at the McFarland School, Tillie worked as an interpreter for clergyman S. Hall Young in and around Wrangell. She married Louis Francis Paul and in 1882 the two became the first Native couple to be commissioned by the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions to found a new missionary school. Located in Klukwan, Alaska, the school served 64 men and women; Tillie and her husband visited homes three times a week, sharing just twelve textbooks among their students. The couple opened a second school in the Tongass region of Alaska, where Paul's family lived. Paul died in 1886, presumably drowned while scouting for a new school location. However, a contemporary biographer of Tillie Paul's, Mary Lee Davis, suggests that his death was a suspicious one. Paul's death left Tillie with three young sons to care for on her own. She moved to Sitka, Alaska to work at Sitka Industrial Training School, invited by Sheldon Jackson, a missionary and the General Agent of Education for the Alaskan Territory. There, she performed a range of tasks, acting as an interpreter, supervising sewing classes, serving as a nurse in the boy's hospital ward, and eventually becoming matron of the girl's dormitory. During her years in Sitka, she worked with a fellow teacher, Fanny Willard, to create a writing system for Tlingit language and together they compiled a Tlingit dictionary. She published several articles about Tlingit culture in the Presbyterian newspaper, The North Star and lectured on Tlingit culture in Sitka as a member of the Society of Alaskan Natural History and Ethnology.\\"Tlingit Baskets to be Displayed\\" Sitka Daily Sentinel (March 7, 1997): 6. via Newspapers.com Tillie also learned to play the organ, becoming proficient enough to accompany school and church events. Some of her translated hymns and prayers are still in use among Tlingit Christians today. Tillie traveled on behalf of the Presbyterian Church, attending its General Assembly in New York City at least twice. In 1902, she was invited to address the Assembly on the subject of women's role in the church. In 1931, Tillie Paul was the first woman ordained as an elder in the Alaska Northwest Synod of the Presbyterian Church, in the first year that Presbyterian women could be so ordained.  Civil rights advocacy  Tillie Paul and her son William In 1905, Tillie founded the New Covenant Legion, a Christian temperance organization intended to reach Native communities considered especially at risk from alcohol abuse, with George Beck, a student at the Sitka school. The New Covenant Legion in turn became the Alaska Native Brotherhood (ANB) and Alaska Native Sisterhood, the first advocacy organizations for Alaska Native rights. Tillie's sons, William Paul and Louis Paul, were leaders in the ANB as were many of the students Tillie taught at the Sitka school. While her sons are generally given credit for transforming the ANB from a service organization to a political one, Tillie's influence in shaping these leaders was recognized by her contemporaries. In November 1922, Tillie assisted a Tlingit relative, Charlie Jones, to vote, after he was refused by election officials in Wrangell. Both were charged with felonies: Charlie Jones for \\"falsely swearing to be a citizen\\" and voting illegally and Tillie for aiding and abetting him. Her son William, by this time an attorney, defended them both at a trial that took place in Ketchikan, Alaska in 1923. The case hinged on the definition of Native citizenship, which, until 1915, had been determined by the Dawes Act of 1887. That act required Native people to sever tribal ties in order to be recognized as citizens. By 1915, the Alaska Territory had passed the Alaska Citizenship Act. It only recognized Native people as citizens under strict conditions, including the endorsement of at least five white citizens, certain testing requirements, as well as proof that they had \\"adopted the habits of civilization.\\" William Paul argued that Jones fulfilled the requirements of citizenship under Dawes, insofar as he owned a house, paid taxes, made charitable contributions, and, generally \\"lived like a white person.\\" Judge Thomas Reed ruled that Dawes preempted the 1915 Citizenship Act. Effectively, this meant that the territorial government could not add procedures such as endorsement by white citizens, testing, or obtaining a certificate of citizenship if the requirements for citizenship under Dawes were met. Tillie Paul Tamaree and Charlie Jones were acquitted. In his ruling, Judge Reed wrote that \\"if you find that the defendant Charley (sic) Jones was born within the limits of the United States, then you must conclude that the said Charley Jones was born under and within the terms of the 1st Section of the 14th Amendment.\\" In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act conferred citizenship on all Native Americans born within the United States and its territories, extending the franchise, but not completely eradicating further attempts to limit Native Americans' right to vote.Peter Metcalfe, A Dangerous Idea: The Alaska Native Brotherhood and the Struggle for Indigenous Rights (University of Alaska Press 2014): 20.

A Calling Blighty film crew prepares to film Royal Air Force personnel from Sheffield in a forward area on the Burma Front. Produced by the Directorate for Army Welfare (DAK) in India from 1944 to 46, Calling Blighty was a series of ten-minute films which featured members of the British Armed Forces stationed in India and Southeast Asia speaking a personal message direct to camera. These films were shown back in the UK to a specially invited audience in a cinema in the area from which those featured came.  Background  Poor welfare and especially length of tour duty, crystallised in the phrase \\"the Forgotten Army\\", led the War Office to investigate the significant issue of morale, which culminated in a tour of South East Asia Command (SEAC) by the Earl of Munster and his subsequent report in September 1944, although a Morale Committee had met regularly in the War Office since 1942.Sargent, Paul. November 1992, \\"'Keep Smiling. Keep those chins up and God bless': filmed messages home from service personnel in the Far East during the Second World War.\\" Imperial War Museum Review No. 7. Calling Blighty was one of the steps introduced by the War Office to address concerns of low morale within the 14th Army stationed in India and SEAC during the latter stages of the Second World War. The series title was probably derived from a Path√© Gazette newsreel issue of early 1944 featuring soldiers based in Italy and the first DAK Calling Blighty was issued in April 1944. The production was based at what was then the Training Film Centre in Bombay, already a film production centre for the making of training films for the Indian Army, (and later to become the Combined Kinematograph Services Film Production and Training Centre ‚Äì CKS), with studio space rented at the Shree Sound Studios.Dawson, Adam. Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12358. Mr Dawson worked both as a director and supervising film editor at the CKS. Calling Blighty was produced in two different formats: one was studio- based and the other shot on location. In the studio a canteen set was built to provide a realistic and relaxing environment and personnel were brought in to deliver their messages. On location the unit had to find the personnel ‚Äì and they travelled widely, through India, Burma and Malaya ‚Äì whom they filmed outside, usually with some significant landmark behind them. The format was similar to the canteen set-up, with each person addressing their loved ones with a short message direct to camera.Atcheler, Jack. Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12357 Mr Atcheler was a cameraman on the Calling Blighty location unit. The equipment used by both studio and location units was broadly the same; 35mm camera, film and sound equipment. In 1945 the cumbersome separate sound camera was replaced by a sound-on-film camera similar to those used for newsreels. The studio had a permanent complement of staff consisting of Indian as well as British personnel. The location unit usually comprised a director, two cameramen, two sound recordists, two assistants and a welfare officer responsible for making the contacts. At least one of the location units operated as part of the Army Kinematograph Service (AKS) and had been sent out from the UK to assist.The Indian documentary maker NS Thapa was a studio-based cameraman on Calling Blighty. Generally, people from one particular city, town or region were grouped together in order to facilitate screening back in the UK, and while personnel from all three services are featured, they are predominantly from the army. The completed negatives were sent by sea to the UK, a journey of about six weeks. On arrival the negative was sent to Denham Studios near Uxbridge, Middlesex, where a print was made for distribution, although a copy was kept in Bombay as a precaution against the negative being lost.Becket, Albert. Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12356. Mr Becket was Production Manager at the CKS from May 1945 until August 1946 Each Calling Blighty screening took place at a cinema in the subjects local area and was usually organised by the regional Army Welfare Committee. The names and addresses of those to be invited were sent to the UK along with the films. These films continued to be produced after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 as many thousands of service personnel were still needed in SEAC; transport and forces were still required for the occupation of Malaya, Java and the return of thousands of prisoners of war, as well as for the occupation of Japan. Production of Calling Blighty finally ceased in April 1946. It is estimated that only slightly more than 10% of the Calling Blighty films have survived - some 52 issues.

History  New Holland was a \\"railway village\\" in the sense that Crewe was a railway town. It was regarded as the railway's eastern terminus until 1887 when this status passed to the hugely enlarged Port of Grimsby. Expanding the dock, building the engine shed, the pier and the railway to it were promoted and started by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway, though by the time the shed opened in 1847 then services began in 1848 that railway had merged with others to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. As built, the shed had four through \\"roads\\" (tracks) each with an individual entrance, all under a double- pitched section roof. It had facilities to provide maintenance, coal and water, which was stored in a reservoir in the triangle between the running lines. The shed's fortunes followed the line, by 1886 it had been reduced to providing motive power for four passenger trains, three of which were local, local shunting and trip working and a handful of goods trains. This level of activity continued well into the 20th Century. New Holland's local services all ran along very level lines, which provided gentle semi-retirement for ancient locomotives and rolling stock, such as ex-MS&LR; 2-4-0s and non- corridor clerestory coaches. The writing was on the wall for New Holland shed from 1912 when Immingham Dock and engine shed opened. It soldiered on as an independent entity until 1941 when it became a sub-shed of Immingham, which it remained until at least 1963. The building was progressively reduced over the years. In 1932 it appeared complete but by 1938 the wooden coaling stage had disappeared and the two northern shed entrances had been knocked into one, by 1960 the roof had gone, but their two supporting walls remained, these, in turn had been demolished by July 1961. A locomotive type particularly associated with the shed in later years was the LNER Class Y3. By 2015 the shed had been demolished and the site built over for industrial use.

The \\"Cabinet of Experts\\" () is an expression connected solely to the Italian Parliament. This term describes the government consisting of a non political body, usually supported by the political forces and functioning in the situations of emergency (especially in the particular politically-economic circumstances), when the party system does not have success in embodying a completely functional cabinet. When this happened, in the history of the republic, there was a need to form a Government consisting of people with Expert skills, with no connection to those political forcesThe site of Italian Senate connotes the similar groups as those characterised by the \\"presence of the people selected out of the apolitical body\\". and the goal to handle the emergency situation by overcoming the idleness of the political parties in the parliament. The term \\"expert\\" is occasionally associated with the political conception of a state governance, also known as technocracy. This is \\"the government of experts\\", an attempt with a more scientific, rational and rigorous intention to resolve the problems of one country, as opposed to the ideology.  Terminology  This expression is similar to the caretaker government, \\"institutional government\\", \\"grand coalition\\", \\"presidential government\\", \\"bridging government\\", \\"objective government\\", \\"government of running affairs\\", \\"truce government\\" and \\"transitional government\\", with which it shares several similar characteristics, but it doesn't have to be their synonym. The government of experts is a ¬´transitional government, established for handling the running affairs, while waiting for the clarification of the political situation¬ª. This ¬´government is lacking a solid political base and is destined to last a limited amount of time, with the goal of solely performing administrative tasks, while waiting for the resolution of the running political crisis¬ª. Similar on a semantic level, but completely or only partially different, is the government of technicians, in which people independent from political parties assume governing roles. These people have the specialist professional or academic skills.  Context  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, is the first non-parliamentary member who assumed the position of the President of the Council of Ministers in 1993. The Italian form of government is a parliamentary government of a weak rationalisation. This means that the Constitution of Italy makes a little concrete progress, when settling the stability of the trust relationship between the parliament and the government. Furthermore, it can not guarantee to the government the power of a political leadership. Italian constitutional regulations, related to the confidential relationship, foresee two possibilities: the motion of no confidence and the Motion of Confidence. The first was practically applied only once in the Italian parliament history (the Prodi II Cabinet crisis in 2008, as a consequence of a positive outcome of the motion of confidence), while the latter had more significance in the Italian history. It foresees that each government should, within ten days from the moment of the line-up, present itself to the chambers to obtain (via Constructive vote of no confidence or by a secret ballot) the approval of their own political course. Lamberto Dini, was the officer in chief in the first government of experts of the Italian Republic formed in 1995. The majority won by the \\"motion of confidence\\" is the \\"political\\" majority. The other type of majority is the \\"arithmetic\\" majority, foreseen by the Constitution (art. 64.3) for approving the particular resolutions. During the phases of peculiar political turmoil, it may happen that the political parties decide not to ally by affirming one with confidence transitional government, whose members can reconcile when the time is right, even about the possible new elections, and form the majority able to follow one clear political course. These \\"temporary\\" governments, the presence of the \\"expert\\" ministers, or the non-politically active experts and executives therefore no deputies, utterly renders the peculiar character of the political neutrality. In such a manner, the fact that the members of the \\"expert\\" cabinet do not appertain to the Parliament, is just a consequence of them not taking part in the every day political life. It is not a discriminating factor that qualifies one government as the \\"cabinet of experts\\", since the Constitution (art. 92-96) does not foresee electing the President of the Council of Ministers and the other ministers from the members of the Parliament. We talk about a \\"government of experts\\" in relation to Dini Cabinet, serving the 1995-1996 term and about the Monti Cabinet, serving from November 16, 2011.Mario Monti, interviewed by Euronews, gave an opinion on the motives that made Italy change to one government of experts in November 2011. Euronews: \\"To confront with the debt crisis Italy and Greece had to turn themselves to the experts. Does that demonstrate the failure of the politicians and the accepted way of running the politics?\\". Mario Monti: \\"I hope and believe that this is not happening. I am probably not the person who can evaluate it neutrally, because I belong to the technocracy that at the moment operates internally. The conflict among the political parties in Italy became unsupportable and devastating, it was impossible to form a new political coalition. It was necessary for the people who don't belong to the political and party system in these countries to make a temporary intervention [sic!]. I hope that this method succeeds\\". Very often it is declared as expert or \\"made of experts\\" like the Ciampi Cabinet (1993-1994), the first cabinet chaired by a non-parliamentary; Carlo Azeglio Ciampi assumed the prime minister position directly from the position of the Governor of the National Bank of Italy, albeit his governing body was mostly made out of the politicians.

It lies within the Austrian state of Salzburg, northeast of the village of Maria Alm and northwest of the Hochk√∂nig massif. The first part of its name comes from the Wildalm (\\"wild alpine meadow\\"), a remote high valley located north of the Wildalmkirchl in the Austro-Bavarian border region in the Steinernes Meer range; the second part of its name is derived from the shape of the mountain which, from various standpoints resembles a church with its roof and tower. At a height of 2,457 m, northeast of the summit, is the Wildalmkirchl bothy or \\"wilderness hut\\" (Biwakschachtel) (open, 8 sleeping places).

In a racing career which lasted from May 1989 until September 1990 she won five of her twelve races. She was one of the best two-year-old fillies in Britain in 1989 when she won four of her six races including the Queen Mary Stakes, Lowther Stakes and Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she competed mainly in sprint races and recorded another major success when she won the Prix Maurice de Gheest. After her retirement from racing she had some success as a broodmare. Her last foal was born in 2008. Background Dead Certain was a bay mare with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by Fulke Johnson Houghton. She was sired by Absalom, a grey sprinter who won the Cornwallis Stakes in 1977, the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1978 and the Diadem Stakes in 1979. The best of Absalom's other progeny was probably Absalom's Lady, a leading National Hunt mare who won the Christmas Hurdle in 1994. Dead Certain's dam Sirnelta won three races over middle distances and produced several other winners including Fire Top, who won twelve races. Sirnelta was a great-granddaughter of Satanella, a broodmare whose other descendants have included Chief Singer, Winged Love and Pleasantly Perfect. During her racing career, Dead Certain was owned by Commander G G \\"Toby\\" Marten and trained by David Elsworth (best known for handling the outstanding steeplechaser Desert Orchid) at Whitsbury near Fordingbridge in Hampshire. Dead Certain was a very temperamental and difficult filly to train: Elsworth recalled \\"She was the kind that you really needed to keep a lid on, Peter Maughan and Rodney Boult (senior members of the stable staff) did a great job, otherwise she'd have boiled over\\". Racing career 1989: two-year-old season Dead Certain began her racing career in the five furlong Lady Caroline Stakes at Windsor Racecourse on 8 May 1989 in which she started 11/10 favourite but was beaten two lengths into second by the Richard Hannon-trained Between the Sticks. Two weeks later she started favourite for a maiden race over the same distance at Salisbury Racecourse and recorded her first success, leading from the start and accelerating in the final furlong to win by one and a half lengths from Love Returned, with a gap of eight lengths back to the other five runners. On her next appearance the filly was moved up in class for the Group Three Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. The National Stakes winner Princess Taufan started favourite ahead of Shagudine and Please Believe Me with Dead Certain, ridden by Steve Cauthen fourth choice on 8/1. She was among the leaders from the start, went to the front two furlongs out and won by one and a half lengths from Please Believe Me with Performing Arts in third. In the Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July, Dead Certain was moved up to six furlongs for the first time and started third favourite behind the highly regarded Chimes of Freedom. Ridden by Ray Cochrane she took the lead in the closing stages but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by Chimes of Freedom, to whom she was conceding five pounds. Cauthen resumed the ride when the filly started 5/4 favourite for the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse on 24 August. Princess Taufan and Please Believe Me were again in opposition as well as the Princess Margaret Stakes runner-up Routilante and the Michael Stoute-trained Fire and Shade. Dead Certain took the lead from the start, drew away in last quarter mile and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and half lengths from Routilante. On 4 October at Newmarket, Dead Certain was one of an eleven horse field to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes, which was then the only Group One race in Britain restricted to juvenile fillies. Chimes of Freedom started favourite after following up her win in the Cherry Hinton with a victory in the Moyglare Stud Stakes. Dead Certain was the 11/2 second choice in the betting whilst the other runners included Kissogram Girl, Mademoiselle Chloe (Harry Rosebery Challenge Trophy), Haunting Beauty (Molecomb Stakes) and Tabdea (Firth of Clyde Stakes). Ridden by Cash Asmussen, she started quickly before settling in second place behind In The Papers. She took the lead two furlongs out and stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by three quarters of a length from Line of Thunder with Chimes of Freedom a head away in third. 1990: three-year-old season On her three-year-old debut, Dead Certain was stepped up in distance for the Fred Darling Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in April. She started favourite but after leading for five furlongs she dropped back and finished tailed-off last of the eight runners behind Salsabil. After a two- month break the filly returned to sprinting and was matched against colts and older horses in the Cork and Orrery Stakes at Royal Ascot. She led throughout the race but was caught in the final strides and beaten a head by the four- year-old colt Great Commotion. She was then moved up to the highest class for the Group One July Cup at Newmarket and finished sixth of the nine runners behind Royal Academy. In August, Dead Certain was sent to France for the Prix Maurice de Gheest (then a Group Two race) over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse. Her four opponents were Machiavellian, Rock City (Gimcrack Stakes), Whippet and Pole Position (Prix Eclipse). Ridden by Asmussen, she took the lead 300 metres from the finish and won by a length and a short head from Rock City and Pole Position. Dead Certain failed to reproduce her best form in her last two races. In the Haydock Sprint Cup on 8 September she started third favourite behind Dayjur and Royal Academy but refused to co- operate with her jockey Alan Munro, throwing her head in the air and finishing tailed-off last of the nine runners. In the Diadem Stakes three weeks later she ran well for half a mile but faded quickly and finished twelfth of the fourteen runners behind the French-trained colt Ron's Victory. Breeding record Dead Certain was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She produced thirteen foals and nine winners between 1992 and her death in 2008: *Full Cover, a bay colt (later gelded) foaled in 1992, sired by Thatching.

Biography  De Vries was born in Winaam, a small village in the province of Friesland, in the north of the Netherlands. He grew up bilingual; West Frisian was the community's everyday language, although it was not the culture language, which was, and still is, Dutch. After completing the secondary school Simon Vestdijk in Harns, he studied political science at the University of Amsterdam. At the time, in 1983, this study in Amsterdam still had a Marxist orientation, which would constitute an important influence in life and works of De Vries. While living in Amsterdam, he developed a major interest in literature, particularly in poetry. After his conscription De Vries remained in military service for another six years, now working as a contract-based intelligence-officer. From 1993 until 1996 he studied history in Groningen. His professor Frank Ankersmit, despite being an obvious liberal, had a significant influence on De Vries's thinking, through his intellectual, theoretical approach of historiography. Meanwhile, De Vries educated the members of the peace keeping force in Bosnia and Croatia about the backgrounds of the conflict in those countries, and he wrote opinion articles on the conflict for every Dutch newspaper. In 1996 he became a journalist for the General Press Bureau Tammeling in Groningen. In 1999, motivated by dissatisfaction with the emotional and biased news coverage, he became a correspondent in Belgrade for the ANP, and the Dutch journals Trouw and Elsevier. From 2000 until 2006 he was a foreign correspondent for Elsevier. For his assignments he traveled to former Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Russia, and Afghanistan, as well as other destinations. In the early 2000s, De Vries was a contributing poet, and also a member of the editorial staff, for the innovative and wayward literary magazine Kistwurk. In February 2003, De Vries started the literary magazine Farsk, of which he was the chief editor until 2006. He also wrote a one-man magazine on the Internet, Oranzjery De Kopspiker, which, in 2010, was succeeded by the weblog Seedyksterfeartfisk. That has been the leading Frisian literary blog for a number of years, with content that informed the artistic- cultural as well as the environmental activist discourse. In the beginning of 2005 he succeeded Jabik Veenbaas as the prose reviewer for the main Frisian newspaper the Leeuwarder Courant. From 2006 until 2011 he was a publisher at the publishing house Friese Pers Boekerij/Noordhoek. Since 2011 he has been associated with the newspaper Friesch Dagblad, first as a review writer for Frisian poetry and essayistic publications, journalist of common cultural topics and columnist of the weekly column \\"Skroeier\\", and since 2014 also as senior editor. In 2015 De Vries, along with Friduwih Riemersma, started the literary magazine Fers2, a digital platform for critical, independent literature and radical literary research.  Poetry  In his youth De Vries started writing Dutch poems. In 2002 he made his debut in Friesland with the collection De weromkommer yn it √ªnl√¢n (The returner in the nonland). Poems from this collection were published earlier in the Frisian literary magazines Trotwaer, Hjir en Kistwurk. In his early poetry he sought a balance between the present and his lost youth in Winaam, with its related theme of lost love. Eastern Europe was also often a subject in his poems from that period. Later on, love, the search for the significant other, and the finding and subsequent losing of security, came to be the prominent themes for his poetry. In addition, this poetry expresses consideration for the West Frisian language, which is a dying language, and for the history and violation of the North Frisian coastal region, and the marginal position of the Frisian speaking artist. De Vries's lyrical poetry shows the development from primarily image- focused poems toward a broader, more narrative poetic style, in which the music of language has been given ample scope. In 2005 De Vries received the Gysbert Japicx Award for his second collection In waarm wek altyd (A warm ice- hole forever). As a result, he was the fourth Frisian author, after Trinus Riemersma, Jan Wybenga and Willem Abma, who was awarded for a young oeuvre; there had never been such a short time between the start of the profession in the belles-lettres and receiving the Gysbert Japicx Award, as in the case of awarding the prize to De Vries. In January 2013 the sixth collection was published, Ravensulver/Ravenzilver (Ravensilver). The seventh collection, Brek dyn klank (Missing your sound) came two years later, in 2015. Brek dyn klank further examines post-modern uprooted relationships, but from a more delicate perspective, and more drawn from experience than the earlier works, while at the same time preserving the classical form.  Essays  De Vries is also one of the main essay writers in Friesland. Several of his essays have found their way as introductions to anthologies or omnibus volumes. The essay collections about the Frisian literature, Identiteit & kowesturten (Identity & cow tails, 2008), Erfskip & krisis (Heritage & crisis, 2015), and Winternocht & moannereis (Winter joy & moon journey, forthcoming), are an idiosyncratic mix of empirical literary history, philosophical cultural criticism, and personal reflection on his own roots. These diverse aspects are connected by a strong engagement. Furthermore, the last collection, Winternocht & moannereis, aims at the decanonization of the nineteenth-century Frisian literature.  Photography  The photo works explore the interface between documentary photography and art photography. The Frisian landscape frequently is the subject and the muse. Some series were shown in gallery exhibitions; other photo series were published in photography books.

Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many fixed roof tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. Fixed roof tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed roof tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions. Applications Storage tanks in general, and fixed roof tanks in particular, containing organic liquids can be found in many industries, including: * petroleum production and refining * petrochemical and chemical manufacturing * bulk storage and transfer operations * other industries consuming organic liquids Fixed roof tanks are typically used with products that have relatively low volatilities and flash points.

The ship sank in 1978 and was raised and scuttled in Alaskan waters in 1979. Design and description The Castle class were an improved corvette design over their predecessor . The Flower class was not considered acceptable for mid-Atlantic sailing and was only used on Atlantic convoy duty out of need. Though the Admiralty would have preferred s, the inability of many small shipyards to construct the larger ships required them to come up with a smaller vessel. The increased length of the Castle class over their predecessorsChesneau, p. 63 and their improved hull form gave the Castles better speed and performance on patrol in the North Atlantic and an acceptable replacement for the Flowers.Brown 2007, p. 142 This, coupled with improved anti-submarine armament in the form of the Squid mortar led to a much more capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel. However, the design did have criticisms, mainly in the way it handled at low speeds and that the class's maximum speed was already slower than the speeds of the new U-boats they would be facing.Brown 2007, p. 127 A Castle-class corvette was long with a beam of and a draught of at deep load.Brown states the beam at and the draught at The ships displaced standard and deep load.Chesneau states the displacement at deep load as The ships had a complement of 120.Brown states the complement as 99 and Johnston states the complement of Canadian ships at 112 (7 officers and 105 ratings).

This was the nineteenth model of British QF 4-inch gun Anti-air armament varied from 4 to 10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.Brown 2007, p. 126 For ASW purposes, the ships were equipped with one three-barreled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 projectiles. The ships also had two depth charge throwers and one depth charge rail on the stern that came with 15 depth charges. The ships were equipped with Type 145 and Type 147B ASDIC.

The tree is one of several ebony species endemic to the island of Mauritius in the western Indian Ocean, and was once the most common, widespread ebony species of that island. Description Monvert gardens Ferney The massive, slow-growing, evergreen tree can reach up to in height. Mature trees can have trunks of over a meter in diameter (However, this species is slow growing and was heavily harvested for timber in the past, so the largest specimens still remaining have trunks of only around 50 cm diameter). The thick leaves have a dark green surface and a slightly paler underside. A distinctive feature is that the leaf margins and veins are mildly translucent, when held up to the light. They produce small, white, fragrant flowers and fleshy fruits. History Like other species of ebony trees, Mauritian ebony trees yield a dark black ebony wood. In its natural habitat, it was a massive canopy tree - common in the dry and upland wet forests of the island. Exploitation by the Dutch Vice- Admiral Wybrandt van Warwijck landed on Mauritius on September 17, 1598, thus beginning Dutch involvement with the island. In 1638, settlers from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) attempted to colonize the island and set up an organized ebony business to sell the rare black wood. However, due to issues with cyclones destroying the settlement, rats destroying crops, settlers illegally trading with English ships, and slaves revolting commonly, the Dutch left the island in 1710. Ebony as a British Import After the French settled Mauritius in 1721, the British took over the island and Port Louis in 1810. Not only was Mauritius used as a stopping point for ships traveling to British India and other parts of Asia, but now it was also used as a major exporter of goods back to London. While the most popular good from Mauritius was sugar by far, the British did harvest a large portion of the ebony forests. The wood was presumably used for carving and decor in London.

This vessel is chiefly known for having been hauled overland by rail from Lake Ewauna to Upper Klamath Lake. It was also one of only two licensed merchant vessels ever to operate on lower Klamath Lake. During 1905 to 1909, Klamath was an essential link in a transportation line to Klamath Falls which involved rail, stage coach, and steamer travel. The late arrival of railroads to the Klamath lakes region made riverine and lake transport more important to the area. Design Although launched in Klamath Falls, Klamath was built in Portland, Oregon. In late 1904, officials of the Klamath Lakes Navigation Company, Capt. George Woodbury and Woodbury‚Äôs father- in-law, \\"Colonel\\" M.G. (Mathew Greenberry) Wilkins (1844-1921), a Civil War veteran on the Confederate side, hired a noted Portland, Oregon ship architect, J.H. Johnson to design a shallow draft propeller-driven steamboat to operate in the Klamath Lakes region. This boat was to be the Klamath. At that time, the only licensed merchant vessel operating on lower Klamath Lake was the Canby, a small (67-foot long, 48 gross tons) propeller-driven steamboat built in 1904 at Keno, Oregon. The Klamath's hull would have an unusual design. The stern was built with a curved recess to allow the propeller to turn without projecting deeper into the water than the keel of the vessel. This was called a \\"tunnel stern\\". The purpose was to allow the steamer to operate in shallow water without damaging the propeller should the boat be grounded or strike an obstacle. This appears to have been the first time this design feature was used on a vessel on waters in the Pacific Northwest. In operation, the tunnel stern did not always provide sufficient protection for the propeller. On Saturday evening, November 10, 1906, when Klamath was returning to Klamath Falls from Laird‚Äôs Landing, the steamer struck a sunken log and every blade was broken off the propeller. When word of the accident reached the company‚Äôs office in Klamath Falls, they dispatched the gasoline launch Ewauna to tow the steamer back to the city. Not long before, a similar accident had broken off two propeller blades, and the company had replaced it with its only spare. No new spare propeller had been ordered, and so the steamer would have to be laid up for about ten days to await delivery of a new propeller. Construction Work on the steamer began in Portland on March 20, 1905, with the sawing and forming of the 45 frames of the boat‚Äôs hull. The frames were made of thick Douglas fir planks. Once the steamer had been assembled, preliminarily, in Portland, it was then \\"knocked down\\" (taken apart) and shipped to Klamath Falls, by way of rail to a placed called Pokegama, Oregon, where the rail line ended, west of Keno, Oregon. At Pokegama the components were loaded onto freight wagons, and hauled overland to Keno, Oregon. Keno was on the Klamath River, downstream from Lake Ewauna. Once at Keno, the steamer‚Äôs components were taken by water transport upriver to Lake Ewauna, on which the city of Klamath Falls was located, and where the boat would be assembled. The assembly of the steamer, which was supervised by John G. Sound, an experienced shipbuilder from Portland, was well underway at Klamath Falls by June 8, 1905. The boiler had been installed into the boat by then.  Launch and trial trip  Launch of Klamath, July 29, 1905. Klamath was launched at 9:07:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 29, 1905 into Lake Ewauna. There was no formal ceremony. However 300 people turned out to watch the launch from the wharves and the nearby bridge, with about 20 boats in the water as well. This was about the entire population of Klamath Falls at the time. The steamer was launched stern first from the boat docks, which were near the bridge on Lake Ewauna. After the launch, the boat was hauled over to a wharf for the finishing work to be completed. On Sunday, July 30, 1905, Captain Woodbury and Colonel Wilkins took the steamer out on a trial trip, making a run to Ady, Oregon Owners of the steamer The boat was built for the Klamath County Navigation Company, which was also known as the Pioneer Line. The company had been incorporated in July, 1903, by filing articles of incorporation with the Oregon Secretary of State in Salem, Oregon. The capital stock of the company was stated to be $10,000. The incorporators were Sherman V. Short (1856-1915), George H. Woodbury (1861-1945), and E.E. Upmeyer. Woodbury was an experienced steamboat man, having worked for eight years prior to the founding of the company as the purser on the well-known Columbia river steamer T.J. Potter. Short, who came from a steamboating family, was also an experienced steamboat man, who had worked as a captain for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, and then for the Oregon Pacific Railroad, on their steamers N.S. Bentley, Wm. M. Hoag and Three Sisters. E.E. Upmeyer (d.1912) was a prominent businessman of Linn County, Oregon, who had been in the state legislature during the 1907 session. Short and Woodbury had been captain and purser, respectively, of the Columbia river steamer Dalles City. M.G. Wilkins, Woodberry‚Äôs father-in-law, also had an interest in the company. The company was preparing to use gasoline launches on the Klamath Lakes. By January 1, 1904, the company had placed two launches in service. Specifications Klamath at dock at Klamath Falls, circa 1907. Note stacked cordwood for fuel on the dock, and protective log boom in water in front of vessel. According to one report, Klamath was long, with a beam (width) of , and a draft (the minimum depth of water necessary to float the boat) of 2 2.5 feet. or 3 feet 2 inches, depending on the source consulted. The official dimensions, as recorded in the U.S. merchant vessel registry, were length , beam , and depth of hold . Overall size was 69 gross and 61 registered tons, which were a measure of volume, not weight. Klamath was driven by a steam engine which generated 150 horsepower, turning a single propeller 42 (or 44) inches in diameter. Upon launching, it was reported that the steamer would probably be able to reach a speed of . The engine was a compound double expansion condensing type, with a high-pressure cylinder of 8-inch diameter and a low- pressure cylinder with a 16-inch diameter, with both cylinders having a 9-inch stroke. The engine was designed by the same ship architect J.H. Johnston who had designed the boat. The engine, which was built at the Hicks Machine Shop in Portland, Oregon, was the most up-to-date design of the time. The boiler was an Almy type water tube boiler, built by the Almy Water Tube Boiler Company, of Providence, Rhode Island. It could be fired by either wood or coal. The boiler was shipped from Providence on March 31, 1905 to Montague, California by rail, and then hauled overland by a wagon and team to Klamath Falls. The steamer had two decks, freight and passenger, a dining room and four staterooms. It was expected, upon launching, that Klamath would be licensed to carry 75 to 100 passengers on regular trips. Freight capacity was 75 tons, in this usage a measure of weight rather than volume. The official merchant vessel registry number was 202570. The officially required number of crew was two. The official homeport (the place where the vessel's licensing documentation was kept) was Coos Bay, Oregon. Operations on lower Klamath Lake Klamath at Merrill Landing, on lower Klamath Lake, July 1906. In 1903, no railroad ran to Klamath Falls, Oregon, the principle settlement in the region. Klamath was intended to serve as a link in a transportation line as follows: steamer Klamath from Klamath Falls to Lairds Landing (), stage coach to Bartles, California on the McCloud River Railroad (); thereafter by rail to the junction with the Southern Pacific Railroad at Upton, California (). The whole trip took a day and a half. Arrangements for the stage line were still being made in late August 1905, when Klamath was licensed to enter commercial service. After the launch on July 29, 1905, Klamath was expected to start its regular run, about each way, between Klamath Falls and Laird‚Äôs Landing, California about August 10 or 15. However, Klamath did not receive its official clearance until August 23, 1905, when the steamer was inspected by U.S. steamboat inspectors E.S. Edwards and George F. Fuller, of Portland, who passed the steamer and issued it a registration certificate. The Klamath Lake Navigation Company also owned two barges which it used with Klamath. These barges measured wide and long, and were built at the same time as Klamath Klamath was expected to be able to make the run between Klamath Falls and Laird‚Äôs Landing in about three hours. Counting the costs of building the new steamer, the Klamath Lake Navigation Company had spent about $25,000 in capital improvements, including a dock at Klamath Falls measuring and a warehouse. Advertisement for steamer Klamath, May 1908 The stage line from Bartles to Laird‚Äôs Landing began operations in October, 1905. By November 1, 1905, Klamath was making three trips a week between Klamath Falls and Laird‚Äôs Landing. No commercial vessel could reach Laird‚Äôs Landing in the natural state of the lake which was in large part a shallow marsh. Instead a channel had to be dredged from the central part where the water was somewhat deeper, and this was done specifically so that Klamath could reach Laird‚Äôs landing. The channel ran about from Laird‚Äôs Landing in a northeasterly direction. In October 1906, Klamath broke its propeller while backing into a submerged ledge of rock about from Klamath Falls. No drydock existed in Klamath Falls to facilitate the repair. Instead, tons of cement were piled on the boat of the steamer, forcing the bow into the water and raising the stern into the air. A raft was then pushed under the stern, which served as platform for workmen to replace the broken propeller. Notable passengers On the evening of Thursday, November 2, 1905, a committee of the Klamath Falls Chamber of Commerce met Oregon‚Äôs Governor George Earle Chamberlain at Keno, on board Klamath. The occasion for the governor‚Äôs visit was the signing of the contract with the government to commence the building of the Klamath Project. Two hundred and fifty people crowded the dock to greet the governor‚Äôs arrival on the steamer. Steam whistles sounded and a band played a welcoming tune. Flags and bunting decorated the city. In August 1907, E.H. Harriman, the extremely wealthy railroad man, visited the Klamath lakes region. Stage line routes changed frequently at that time, and rather than proceed to Laird‚Äôs Landing from the California Northeastern rail terminus, Harriman and his party met the steamer at Teeter‚Äôs Landing (about south of Keno) and proceeded from there on Klamath into Klamath Falls. Harriman, then an older man, was worn out by the stage ride, but he was reported to have been revived somewhat by the ride on the then-modern steamer, asking questions of Col. Wilkins as to how it was brought to the lake, the demand for its services, and other inquiries about its operation. Ice problems Klamath had problems with ice on the lower lake. On November 24, 1906, ice knocked a hole in the side of the steamer. On December 20, 1906, Klamath was forced to suspend operations for the winter because of the amount of ice on the lake. Route change Starting on May 1, 1908, Klamath was new route that was advertised as offering \\"ease and comforted In travel\\", with \\"only 12 miles of staging and then a delightful boat ride up the Klamath River to Klamath Falls.\\" Travellers departing Klamath Falls would leave on the steamer Klamath at 4:00 a.m. for Teeter‚Äôs Landing, from whence they would proceed by stage coach to the rail line at Dorris, California. Heavy traffic in 1908 Klamath pushing barges in Lake Ewauna, circa 1907. Traffic was particularly heavy in August 1908. Klamath was heavily loaded on every trip, and almost every other day a barge was brought in loaded with freight. At that time, almost all the freight to Klamath Falls was loaded onto the steamer and the barges at Teeters and brought to the city by water. With the approach of the railroad, merchants were going to be relieved from the need to stock up on supplies prior to the winter, which would disrupt supplies for several months. Last run on the lower lake Last trip of Klamath on lower Klamath lake, May 20, 1909. The railroad reached Klamath Falls in May 1909. Klamath made its last commercial trip on the lower lake on Thursday, May 20, 1909. Shortly after 9:00 a.m. that day the steamer departed Klamath Falls bound for Teeter‚Äôs Landing (also known as Blidell and, later, Ady) with more than 100 people on board. A large crowd gathered at the docks to watch Klamath depart. When the steamer reached Ady, shortly before noon, the passengers disembarked and crowded on to the first train to run to Klamath Falls. Financial problems In early September 1907, demands by creditors forced the Klamath Lakes Navigation Company into receivership. W.R. \\"Bill\\" Davis agreed to pay off the company‚Äôs debts, then about $10,000, and as security he was given a second mortgage against the company‚Äôs assets and was given control of the company. On November 27, 1908, Klamath was mortgaged to the Ladd and Tilton bank, and William R. Davis, to secure the payment of a promissory note in the amount of $8,100 payable to the bank, due in one year, with annual interest of 8%, executed by the Klamath Lake Navigation Company in favor of the bank on November 12, and a similar note, executed in favor of William R. Davis, in the amount of $5,000. The company fell behind in its payments on the debt to the bank and Davis. On February 7, 1912, notice was published that on March 9, 1912, under the terms of their mortgage dated November 27, 1908, Ladd and Tilton, and Davis, would conduct an auction at the dock at Shippington, to sell Klamath to satisfy the debt. Transfer to upper Klamath Lake In 1909, the railroad reached Klamath Falls. This took away most of the business for Klamath on Lower Klamath Lake. On July 1, 1909, it was reported that plans were being made to transfer the boat to the upper lake, and that parties from Portland had come to Klamath Falls to investigate making bids to move the steamer. The plan at that time was to run Klamath on the upper lake to connect with the state line that ran from Crystal Creek to Crater Lake, allowing travelers departing Klamath Falls to reach Crater Lake 12 hours later. The steamer was therefore transferred to upper Klamath Lake. A short water passage, called the Link River, ran from upper Klamath Lake to Lake Ewauna, along which lay the waterfront of Klamath Falls. However, the Link River was impassable to a large vessel like the Klamath. Transfer to the upper lake would require Klamath to be hauled overland. This was done by dredging a cut from Lake Ewauna through the tule reeds to the railroad fill, near where the Big Lakes Mill.in the 1950s. A spur rail line was built out to Klamath, the boat was raised up on timbers, and two flat cars were run under the steamer. Blocks were placed under the boat to secure the load, and it was hauled to the upper lake and launched there in a similar fashion. The move seems to have happened in the spring of 1910. A legal dispute arose over the payment of the contractors, with the company refusing to pay. The courts however ruled in favor of the contractors. Operations on upper Klamath Lake Klamath and gasoline launch Spray at Eagle Ridge landing, on upper Klamath Lake, circa 1910. By June 24, 1910, Klamath had been launched on the upper lake. Klamath had been on the shipways for two weeks undergoing repair. The boat had been taken to Shippington, where new tubes were to be installed in the boiler, and the vessels entire woodwork repainted and renovated. Connections to Crater Lake To serve tourists who it was anticipated would be taking the steamer on the route to Crater Lake the next summer, a dining room was fitted up. The plan for summer operations in 1910 was to have the steamer proceed from Klamath Falls with passengers to Agency Landing, where the tourists would disembark and then ride in automobiles to Crater Lake. Plans were then being made for the construction of Crater Lake Lodge, from which it was reported, the steamer Klamath could be seen at midday on the lake, some away. Route on the lake On July 1, 1910, Klamath made its trial run on upper Klamath Lake to Agency Landing. By May 1911, under Captain Ray H. Reed, Klamath was making daily trips to the resorts of Eagle Ridge Tavern and Rocky Point, as well as Doak‚Äôs Landing, Woodbine, and Odessa departing Klamath Falls from the Shippington wharf at 9:00 a.m. and returning at 5:00 p.m. The City Transfer bus picked up passengers for the steamer from the principal hotels in Klamath Falls, starting at 8:00 a.m. The Sunday excursions included a stop for three-and-a-half hours at the Rocky Point resort. On Sundays, the fare was $1.00 for a round-trip excursion to all points on the lake. Tickets were sold at the hotels in Klamath Falls and also at the Navigation Building. After June 1, 1911, the Klamath was to connect at Rocky Point with the Crater Lake Auto Line for overland transport to Crater Lake and Medford. About May 1911 or earlier Klamath had been converted into an oil-burner. An oil tank car was placed at the Pelican Bay Lumber Company‚Äôs railroad siding to refuel the steamboat. In 1911 and 1912, Klamath supported logging and lumber operations by towing log rafts to the Pelican Bay sawmill and carrying personnel and supplies for the lumber camps.  New owners plan reconstruction  In 1913, Klamath was owned by the Crater Lake Company, which, in November of that year sold the steamer to Pelican Bay Lumber Co. On November 12, 1913, the new owners announced plans to modify the steamer. The cabin structure was to be cut down to tug boat configuration, that is, mostly removed, with heavy towing bits placed in the center of the vessel. Living quarters for the crew were to be constructed in the forward part of the boat. Navigation issues At Pelican Bay, a short channel had been cut from the main lake to the Pelican Bay Lumber mill to facilitate steamboat operations. On Saturday, July 22, 1911, at about 4:00 p.m., Klamath sank while moored at Agency Landing. The boat was then owned by Captain Parker. Part of the crew was sleeping on board when the boat sank. The stern went down in about of water, while the bow remained on the bank of the lake, almost clear of the water. Ice posed a problem for the steamer on the upper lake, just as it had on the lower lake. In December 1913, Klamath suspended operations for the winter when ice on the upper lake was or more thick. On June 21, 1915, it was reported that Klamath had sunk, again, at Pelican Bay Landing the previous Sunday afternoon, June 20, 1915. Details were not available however in the first report. In November 1916, a barge being pushed by Klamath collided with the small sternwheeler tug Modoc, sinking the Modoc. By November 16, 1916, Modoc had been raised. Abandonment Klamath abandoned at log pond of Pelican Bay Lumber Company, March, 1948. About 1925, or earlier, Klamath was abandoned on the west side of Upper Klamath Lake, in the log pond of the Pelican Bay Lumber Company. The boat was abandoned in the channel cut for the steamer to access the sawmill. The remains of the steamer were still visible as late as the 1950s.

She was Abbess of Gandersheim from 956 to 1001 and personally instructed dramatist and poet Hrosvit of Gandersheim. Under Gerberga's rule, Gandersheim Abbey served as an Ottonian center of cultural, spiritual, and intellectual life.  Family and early life  Gerberga's exact dates of birth and death are not known, though the approximate year of birth 940 has been deduced from sources. Her parents were Henry I, Duke of Bavaria and a member of the Ottonian dynasty, and Judith. At least three of her siblings are known: Henry II of Bavaria, Hadwig of Swabia, and Brunon, Count of Brunswick. Gerberga was sent for education to Gandersheim Abbey at an early age, and became abbess in 956. She supported her brother Henry II in his quest to achieve more influence for their family, but also remained on good terms with her uncle Emperor Otto I and cousin Emperor Otto II. Gerberga followed in a long tradition of royal abbesses at Gandersheim. The abbey was established by her great-great-grandparents, the Saxon nobles Liudolf and Oda, in the 9th century. Three of their daughters, Hathumonda (852-74), Gerberta I (874-96), and Christina (896-918) served as Gandersheim's three founding abbesses. Gerberga II's ascension to abbess in 965 suggests that Ottonian imperial ties to Gandersheim remained strong throughout the following century.  Life as abbess  Gerberga II served as abbess of Gandersheim from approximately 965 to 1001. She was praised for her integrity, and her reign has been called the \\"golden age\\" of the abbey, and described as a time of peace, tranquility, and scholarship. Gandersheim became a center of Ottonian intellectual and spiritual activity, functioning as a hospital, library, a rest stop for refugees or travelers, and, most notably, a school. Many aristocratic families sent their daughters to the abbey to be educated. Among them was the Emperor Otto II and his wife Theophanu, who sent their five-year-old daughter Sophia I to live under Gerberga's care and eventually become her successor. Gandersheim was given a great deal of independence by the Ottonian rulers. In 947, Gerberga's uncle Emperor Otto I freed the abbey from royal rule and granted the abbess the authority to hold courts of law, keep an army, and coin money. Resultantly, there seems to have been much good will between Gerberga and her uncle. During her reign, she commissioned a history of his life to be written and presented to him by her canoness Hrosvit. Gandersheim was just one of many influential abbeys in the 10th century. Gerberga's gradma Matilda of Ringelheim had founded Quedlinburg Abbey in 936, creating tension regarding the leadership of the abbeys. Another rivaling place was Essen Abbey which was also led by family members.  Education and teaching  As a member of the imperial family, Gerberga was well-educated for her time. She was first instructed at St. Emmeram's Abbey in Bavaria, which is likely where she learned the works of many Roman and patristic writers. Like her sister Hadwig, she may have also been educated in Greek. The canoness Hrotsvit wrote of Gerberga's education, \\"She is younger in years than I, but as befits the Emperor's niece, more advanced in learning.\\" Scholars have suggested that Hrotsvit, the German canoness, dramatist, and poet, was the special prot√©g√© of Gerberga. Hrotsvit praised her abbess in the preface to her legends, writing, \\"It was she, who, other authors concerning, continued my instruction, offering me an introduction to the works of those writers whom she herself studied with learned men.\\" Hrotsvit wrote all her works, which include dramas, poems, legends, and histories, while a canoness at Gandersheim. Her ', a history of the Ottonian dynasty, was written at the specific request of Gerberga, who likely intended to honor her family lineage and her uncle Otto I. Gerberga encouraged her \\"effort and diligence in writing\\".

This is done on or directly before the start of the Advent season, in preparation for Christmastide. The service involves the placement of evergreen vegetation in the parish. Items such as the evergreen wreath, in Christianity, carry the religious symbolism of everlasting life, a theological concept within that faith. As such, during the liturgy, \\"Biblical passages and other readings help explain the significance of the holly, the cedar, the Advent wreath, the Chrismon tree, and any other special decorations\\". Christmas trees are frequently erected during the hanging of the greens, although they are sometimes left bare until Christmas Eve. Outside of a formal liturgy, in many countries, such as Sweden, people start to set up their Advent and Christmas decorations on the first day of Advent. In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas decorations are removed are Twelfth Night, and if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations. Leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas is historically considered to be inauspicious.

The Fellowship provides instruction on what is referred to as the Lemurian Philosophy , which includes concepts of cosmic or universal law and various principles associated with the application of these laws. Teachings range from reincarnation and karma, to balanced living, to Christ's ministry and message. Students of the Fellowship progress through a correspondence course that consists of a series of 12 basic lessons that can be followed by an advanced training leading to acceptance into the Lemurian Order. Order members continue to work on personal development as well as contribute to group activities, one key activity being the making of various hand-made crafts, a number of which have been recognized for their contribution to 20th century modern design. Founding The Lemurian Fellowship was founded in Chicago in 1936 by Robert D. Stelle, a teacher, author, and physician, and Howard Zitko, his associate. After moving briefly to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and then Chula Vista, California, the Fellowship relocated near Ramona, California, to get away from the pressures and distractions of the city, but also have the advantages of being near a major city, San Diego. The Fellowship is registered as a nonprofit, non-stock, religious corporation under California law, and is overseen administratively by a board of governors. Philosophy, teachings, and beliefs According to the Fellowship, the Lemurian Philosophy was revealed to Stelle by highly advanced men and women, called Masters or Elder Brothers. The Philosophy is said to have formed the foundation of the so-called Mukulian civilization on the legendary continent of Mu (also known as Lemuria) now covered by the Pacific Ocean. This lost continent is considered incompatible with the theory of plate tectonics, the standard theory describing movement of the earth's lithosphere accepted by most, but not all, earth scientists. Nonetheless, the Lemurian Philosophy points to various megalithic structures and other features on various Pacific Islands, and in South America and Asia, as indications that the continent and an advanced civilization did at one time exist. The Fellowship teaches that, as a result of following universal law as individuals and as a nation, a peaceful and prosperous civilization was built on Mu, reaching great heights culturally and materially. However, corrupting, destructive elements eventually began to grow and significantly impact the society, with the result that the civilization declined and the continent itself eventually submerged. When sufficient numbers of people are again educated and trained to live by universal laws, such as those taught by Christ, it is believed that a new, advanced human society will be built. It is believed this will take many generations, but will recreate and then surpass what existed on the continent of Mu. The Lemurian Philosophy combines elements characteristic of eastern and western religious traditions. For example, teachings include the doctrines of reincarnation and karma as well as Christ's precepts in the gospels of the Christian Bible. The spirit, or real identity of an individual is referred to as the Ego. The inherent potential of Egos is considered vast and through discovering the universal laws that govern existence, and then learning to cooperate with and use them, one can eventually master human life and so control one's environment and destiny. This is described as a gradual process, requiring many incarnations to gain the knowledge and wisdom needed. Egos are meant to move toward perfection, and toward God. From the Fellowship's perspective, all religions are considered to have their value, and the Lemurian teachings do not seek to change what is good in any religion, or to proselytize. Rather, teachings and training are offered to people who are interested in the Philosophy and are willing to work with their problems. Students are neither expected nor required to abandon any religion they may be following or beliefs they may hold. Within the broader context of the Philosophy's beliefs regarding the purpose of human life, and the organization and operation of the universe, the Fellowship describes the principles it teaches to its students as practical in nature, with the emphasis on applying them to solve problems of everyday living. One principle is that of living balanced lives, and particularly to acquire balanced growth within oneself in three areas: spiritual, material or physical, and mental. To assist towards achieving balanced growth, students work to build their character through developing twelve primary virtues: precision, efficiency, forbearance, patience, discrimination, kindliness, tolerance, devotion, sincerity, courage, charity, humility. The importance of balance is considered to hold not only for the development of individuals, but for groups of individuals and nations as well. For example, one of the principles said to have guided the Mukulian government was: > No organized society can hope to prosper permanently except as each member > thereof prospers, and no individual member can hope to prosper permanently > except as the group or society as a whole prospers. Student training Training of students in the Lemurian Philosophy is through a correspondence course, either through regular mail or online. The basic instruction consists of 12 lessons, each being sent to a student based on successful completion of the one prior. Lessons cover topics such as the laws of action and reaction, precipitation, compensation, and transmutation. The law of action and reaction includes Isaac Newton's definition of it, but also what is commonly referred to as the Golden Rule. Precipitation is used for bringing desired and important things into one's life. The law of compensation influences economic security and is said to have a spiritual foundation. An example of following the law of transmutation would be finding the good in a situation by changing one's viewpoint. Other topics covered are health, marriage and family relationships, helping others, the mind, the twelve virtues, the Bible, transition (bodily death), and reincarnation (rebirth as humans). The training takes a learn-by-doing approach, and students answer a questionnaire after each lesson to determine their understanding and use of the concepts presented. If a student completes the 12 basic lessons satisfactorily, he or she may be offered what is called the Advanced Training. Lemurian Order Upon completing the Advanced Training, qualified students may join the Lemurian Order. Order members take part in activities that further the goals of the Lemurian Philosophy and program. Order headquarters is located on a 200-acre property called \\"The Gateway,\\" also near Ramona, California, but separate from Fellowship headquarters. Some Order members live at or near Gateway. However, Order members are not required to relocate there, but can participate in Order activities to whatever extent they can, from wherever they live. One ongoing group activity of the Order is the Lemurian Crafts, where hand-made products have been designed and fashioned ranging from wooden beakers, to lamps, to door and cabinet hardware, to violins and music stands. Emphasis is on making useful and beautiful products. One item, a wooden beaker, is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. A key function of the Crafts endeavor is to provide an opportunity for Order members to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Lemurian teachings while working together. The Fellowship is supported primarily by student tuition, tithes, gifts, and sales of crafts items.

Health Conditions The most common injury type suffered by musicians is repetitive strain injury (RSIs). A survey of orchestral performers found that 64-76% had significant RSIs. Other types of musculoskeletal disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and focal dystonia, are also common. Non-musculoskeletal problems include contact dermatitis, hearing problems such as tinnitus, respiratory disorders or pneumothorax, increased intraocular pressure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and psychological issues such as performance anxiety. Musicians may suffer tinnitus and hearing disorders due to exposure to loud music, such as hyperacusis or diplacusis. They also are at an increased risk of having problems with the stomatognathic system, in particular mouth and teeth, which may in some cases lead to permanent injuries that prevent the musicians from playing. There is little consistency across the hearing healthcare sector with respect to care of musicians' hearing and provision of hearing protection. However, the American Academy of Audiology has published a consensus document regarding best practices for hearing loss prevention with musicians. Woodwind instrumentalists, in rare cases, suffer a condition known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also referred to as saxophone lung, can be caused by Exophiala infection.

Released in 2017 on PS4 and on PC the following year, the game's story bridges the events between Psychonauts and Psychonauts 2. Gameplay Unlike the original Psychonauts, Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin is not a 3D platformer, but instead a first-person puzzle-focused game similar to a point-and-click adventure. As Raz, the player always remains in a seated position, and may interact with characters and objects in the world using his psychic powers such as telekinesis and pyrokinesis. While many VR games have utilized a \\"blink teleportation\\" mechanic to allow players to travel in the virtual world, Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin instead requires the player to use Raz's clairvoyance ability to see the world from the perspectives of the other characters in the scene (who also remain seated throughout). These mechanics are used to solve puzzles to gain information and trigger events which further the plot and advance the game. Plot At the end of Psychonauts Raz is recognized as a talented PSI Cadet and is asked to join his tutors as a fully fledged Psychonaut. But as Raz prepares to go home from camp with his father, news arrives that Lili's father, the Grand Head of the Psychonauts Truman Zanotto, has been kidnapped. The team, Raz and Lili included, fly off in the Psychonauts' jet to rescue him. Using his Clairvoyance ability, Raz discovers Zanotto is being held in the Rhombus of Ruin (a play on the Bermuda Triangle). The team travels into the Rhombus of Ruin, but the jet crashes before they can act. Raz awakens tied to a chair in the chamber Zanotto is being kept. Using his psychic abilities to explore the junk filled ocean, Raz finds Sasha, Milla, Lili and Oleander trapped in hallucinations due to a Psylirium deposit below them. After freeing his team from their hallucinations, Raz is pulled back into the chamber by Dr. Loboto, the insane ex-dentist from the first game, and Zanotto's kidnapper. By using a Psycho-Portal given to him by Oleander, Raz enters Loboto's mind. There he fights a gigantic version of Loboto and enters his memories, where Raz learns Loboto was once a psychic himself, and his parents disapproved of his abilities and had him sent to Thorney Towers. After Raz exits Loboto's mind, Loboto seems to have a change of heart, but instead leaves Raz and the others and floods the base. They escape from the base with Zanotto, and the game ends with Lili telling her father about their adventures, and him shouting in disbelief that Raz is her boyfriend. Development The concept for Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin came about during the lead-up to the crowd-sourcing campaign for Psychonauts 2. According to Double Fine's CEO, Tim Schafer, they were looking to see what types of games they could develop with a virtual reality (VR) system, comparing it to the games they had made for the Kinect system earlier. Due to their recent focus on Psychonauts, the team agreed that a VR-based Psychonauts game would be a good fit, allowing the player to become immersed in the odd environments within the Psychonauts universe. The game was released on February 21, 2017 for PlayStation VR, after approximately a year and a half of development. A year later, the game was released on PC on April 19, 2018 for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Reception Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin received average reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the unique gameplay mechanics and their integration into the story, as well as the continued expansion of the Psychonauts universe. Criticism was directed at the game's short length, limited replay value, and abrupt ending. The game was nominated for \\"Best VR Experience\\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, and for \\"Immersive Reality Game of the Year\\" at the 21st Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.

It was a Gujarati translation of The Indian Cottage or A Search After Truth (1791), an English translation by Edward Augustus Kendall of the French work La Chaumi√®re Indienne (1790) by Jacques- Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. As it was a translation of a translation, its claim as the first novel in Gujarati is disputed and Karan Ghelo is considered as the first original novel of Gujarati language. See Page 386, History of Indian Literature.Pollock, Sheldon. The Language of the Gods in the World of Men: Sanskrit, Culture and Power in Premodern India. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006. p. 297. The book was translated in English in 2015. The novel depicts Karan, the last Vaghela ruler of Gujarat (c. 1296‚Äì1305) who was defeated by the Turkish forces of Allauddin Khilji in 1298. The novel was written for educational purpose. It was based on variety of historical sources but author took liberty in depiction of some incidents. The novel deals with social as well as religious issues. The book was well received and was translated in Marathi and English. It was adapted into plays and films. Plot The Rajput king Karan Vaghela rules Anhilwad Patan, a large kingdom located in north Gujarat, and is well-served by his prime minister, Madhav. It happens one day that he comes face-to-face with Madhav's wife, Roopsundari (who, like all well-born women, lives in seclusion) and has a chat with her. The king becomes besotted by her and, after pondering for a long time, decides to set aside all considerations of decency and propriety in order to avail himself of the woman. He sends the minister away on a mission and, in his absence, abducts Roopsundari. Madhav's brother is killed by the king's men while making a heroic but vain attempt to protect his sister-in-law. Later the same day, his wife Gunasundari commits Sati by immolating herself on the funeral pyre of her valiant husband. The hapless Roopsundari, after being abducted and taken to the palace, kills herself before it is possible for the king to ruin her virtue. She dies with her chastity intact, and the king has gained nothing but infamy for his despicable deed. He has also made a dangerous and relentless enemy. His former minister Madhav has escaped the devastation of his family. He abandons Anhilwad Patan for good and makes his way to Delhi. On his way, he experiences many adventures, including several wonderful ones at the almost mystical Mount Abu. Madhav eventually reaches Delhi, where he persuades the Muslim sultan Allauddin Khilji to invade Gujarat, promising him all help in the venture and much plunder at the end of it. As former minister, Madhav is a knowledgeable and influential man. With his help, Khilji invades Gujarat, destroys Patan fort and plunders the treasures of that kingdom and of several others. On his part, King Karan Vaghela performs many heroic feats on battlefield, but eventually loses not just his kingdom but also his wife, Kaularani. After the defeat, Karan gathers what remains of his family and followers and flees to Baglan in south Gujarat, to seek refuge with his old friend Ramdev, the Maratha ruler of Deogadh. With him is his unwed daughter, Deval Devi, still only a child. As the dust settles and negotiations for peace are set afoot, Karan is required to face one more horror: the hateful Khilji wants Karan to give his daughter in marriage to his own son and heir, Khizr Khan. The proposal is abominable to Karan, and after he returns an insulting refusal, a second battle becomes inevitable. As he prepares for war, Karan is extremely concerned about the security of his daughter and the preservation of her virtue and her future. He therefore bestows his daughter upon Shankaldev, the son and heir of his host and old friend Ramdev. Their betrothal is performed shortly before the battle with Khilji commences. Nevertheless, that battle is lost, and the daughter is also lost with the battle. It is depicted in the book that Karan Vaghela dies a martyr on the field of battle and does not live to witness invasion of his motherland by invaders. His defeat results in the end of Rajput (Hindu) rule and the beginning of Muslim rule in Gujarat. Origin Nandshankar Mehta was the headmaster of an English-medium school in Surat. The British administrators of Bombay Presidency were encouraging local Indians to write books for educational purpose. Mehta had written in the preface to the first edition, He started writing in 1863 and completed the novel in 1866. According to his son and biographer Vinayak Mehta, he wanted to write a historical novel on the pivotal incident in the history of Gujarat. He had considered to write a novel on the fall of Champaner and the destruction of Somnath temple but finally decided to write about the conquest of Gujarat by Turkish forces of Allauddin Khilji in 1298. The conquest ended the Hindu Rajput rule in Gujarat and started the Muslim rule in the state. The defeat gained the epithet, Ghelo (foolish or crazy) to Karan Vaghela. He used western style of novel writing with local style of inclusion of stories within stories in narrative. He was interested in the history and used several historical materials including indigenous histories, bard tales, Jain chronicles or Persian sources for the novel. The invasion by Khilji, the story of Madhav's revenge, the defeat of Karan Vaghela and the fall of Patan had been subjects of the oral traditions of bards, the Bhat and Charans, of Gujarat. Many contemporary Jain chronicles such as the Prabandhachintamani of Merutunga (1305), Dharmaranya (written between 1300 and 1450), and Tirthakalpataru of Jinaprabha Suri gave accounts of the invasion. It is also recorded in Padmanabha's medieval epic, Kanhadade Prabandha, written in 1455. Mehta had drawn the core story of Karan Vaghela as well several detailed description of the historical time from the Rasamala; a collection of bard tales, Persian texts, Jain chronicles, folklore of Gujarat; published by Alexander Kinloch Forbes with help of Dalpatram in 1858. For scenes in Delhi, he had used Persian texts such as the works of Amir Khusrau, Khilji's court poet, and the accounts of Ziauddin Barni. Karan Vaghela's second battle with Khilji's forces and the capture of his daughter Devaldevi were described by Amir Khusrau in the masnavi Deval Devi Khizr Khan, popularly known as Ishqia. The 16th-century historian Ferishta had also written prose on the romance between Deval Devi and Khizr Khan. Themes Nandshankar Mehta was a social and religious reformer so he had discussed several social and religious ideas throughout the novel. He had discussed issues of arranged marriage and child marriage in particularly through the love story of Devaldevi and Shankaldev. He had advocated marriage based on consent, commitment, hard work and mutual respect. Through the reunion between Madhav and Roopsundari, he had portrayed that ‚Äúfallen women‚Äù are accepted. He had also put his arguments against Sati and Jauhar traditions by the immolation of Gunsundari, the wife of Madhav's brother. Historical accuracy Mehta had written in the first edition, His use of several types of historical sources gives detailed and accurate account of the historical times as described in the sources. He has taken liberty to depict Karan Vaghela fighting heroically and being defeated though the sources describe that he fled. The Persian sources describe the conquest of Gujarat as a mere campaign which succeeded without much efforts. Kanhadade Prabandha describes the destructive effect of invasion and blames Madhav. The Rajput sources blame Madhav and also consider it as divine retribution for not following the rules of Kshatriya. Mehta had described the invasion as the result of Karan Vaghela's own deeds. Release and reception Nandshankar Mehta published Karan Ghelo in 1866. It was the first original novel in Gujarati. It was an immediate success. It was very popular and had nine reprints between 1866 and 1934. It was revived and reprinted in 1986 and last in 2007. It was the only novel written by Mehta. Sisir Kumar Das notes that the story became very popular due to evocation of the glory of ancient town of Surat, the residence of Mehta. He also notes that the story has fine descriptive passages but it fails to qualify as fine narrative. He considers the novel as a foundation of the historical novel in Gujarati. It was described as \\"a colonial moment from Gujarat\\" depicting time of 1860s by Arshia Sattar of Open magazine. Radhika Herzberger of The Caravan magazine had praised the English translation. Adaptations and translations The lyrics written in Lalit metre from the novel, Karan Raj! Tu, Kyah Re Gayo; Nagar Chhodine Shidne Rahyo; Karam Futiyu, Pran Jay Re; Sukh Sada Gayu, Hay Hay Re (Gujarati: \\"‡™ï‡™∞‡™£ ‡™∞‡™æ‡™ú ! ‡™§‡´Å‡™Ç, ‡™ï‡´ç‡™Ø‡™æ‡™Ç‡™π ‡™∞‡´á ‡™ó‡™Ø‡´ã; ‡™®‡™ó‡™∞ ‡™õ‡´ã‡™°‡´Ä‡™®‡´á ‡™∂‡´Ä‡™¶‡™®‡´á ‡™∞‡™π‡´ç‡™Ø‡´ã; ‡™ï‡™∞‡™Æ ‡™´‡´Ç‡™ü‡™ø‡™Ø‡´Å‡™Ç, ‡™™‡´ç‡™∞‡™æ‡™£ ‡™ú‡™æ‡™Ø ‡™∞‡´á; ‡™∏‡´Å‡™ñ ‡™∏‡™¶‡™æ ‡™ó‡™Ø‡´Å‡™Ç, ‡™π‡™æ‡™Ø ‡™π‡™æ‡™Ø‡™∞‡´á\\") (English: \\"Karan Raja, O husband mine, why have you left me, where do you hide?\\") was composed with music and was immensely popular. Two years after the publication, in 1868, the novel was adapted into the play Gujarat No Chhello Raja Karan Ghelo (English: \\"Karan Ghelo, the Last King of Gujarat\\") by Parsi theatre of Bombay. The novel was translated into Marathi and serialised in a magazine Vividh Jananan Vistara. Mulshankar Mulani adapted the novel into the play Karanghelo in 1896 for Mumbai Gujarati Natak Mandali. The story was also the subject of the silent film, Karan Ghelo (1924) by S. N. Patankar. It was translated in English by Tulsi Vatsal and Aban Mukherji; and was published in Viking by Penguin Books India in 2015. Legacy The story of Karan Vaghela has endured in the public memory of Gujarat. It is considered as the foundation of the historical fiction in Gujarati language. It was taught in Gujarati medium schools as textbook. Chandravadan Mehta also wrote a play, Sandhyakal on the same subject. The story also inspired two novels during the period of Mahagujarat Movement, the movement for the separate linguistic state of Gujarat; Bhagnapaduka (1955) by K. M. Munshi and Rai, Karan Ghelo (1960) by Dhumketu. The novel is also studied in academics to trace the roots of Gujarati regional identity.

In 2008, AFT S.p.A (Linkem's parent company) won the notice of allocation for WiMax frequency bands 3.4-3.6 GHz, in 13 Italian regions with their offer of 34,420,000 Lira. With its WiMax service, Linkem reaches more than 80% of Italy's population - becoming the first Italian operator to launch a WiMax- based voice and broadband service.History In 2010 Telecom Italia developed an agreement with Linkem for the rent of its WiMax networks, offering free WiMax in the regions where Linkem has its own network.http://www.oneadsl.it/18/11/2010/ecco-la-copertura-del-servizio-wimax- di-telecom-italia/ By 2012, Linkem was serving a population of over 27 million residents. 2015 marked the activation of LTE coverage on 3.5 GHz frequencies (Linkem proprietary frequencies) with a campaign to replace outdoor WiMax antennas.http://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/tlc/21697_rota-digital-gap-dal- wimax-ottimi-riscontri.htm Ownership In 2003 shareholders were reported to be Angel Ventures Servi√ßos de Consultorio SA (42%), 2G Investments S.p.A.

Palmer was the fourth child and third son of the Hon. Thomas and Susanna (Palmer) Palmer, of Little Compton, R. I., where he was born November 12, 1808. It was intended that he should pursue a commercial career, and therefore he was sent at the age of 13 to Boston to begin a clerkship in a large business house, while at the same time completing his education. By the age of 15, he had decided that he wished to prepare for college, and he was then sent, accordingly, to Phillips Academy, Andover. He graduated from Yale College in 1830. On leaving college he taught for a year in a private school for young ladies in New York City, and then returned to New Haven, where‚Äîat first in connection with Dr. E. A. Andrews, and later as sole proprietor‚Äîhe conducted the Young Ladies' Institute, in Wooster Place. In the meantime he was married, October 3, 1832, to Ann Maria, daughter of the late Marmaduke Waud, a merchant of Albany, of English birth. He also prosecuted theological studies while in New Haven, and on disposing of his school, in the fall of 1834, removed to Boston, and began to preach. In 1835 he accepted a call to a new church (now called the Central Church) in Bath, Maine, over which he was ordained on the 22nd of July. Fifteen years of earnest, practical labor followed, after which rest and change of scene were needed, and on December 10, 1850, he was installed as the first pastor of the newly formed First Congregational Church of Albany, New York. Here he continued for fifteen most fruitful years of labor, until April 18, 1866, when he was dismissed to accept the secretaryship of the American Congregational Union, in New York City. Here he served the churches for twelve years, or until May 1, 1878, during which time more than 600 churches were elected by the aid of this society. As the salary was insufficient, he was stimulated to a good deal of literary labor during this period. In May, 1870, he removed his residence to Newark, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his life. On retiring from the service of the Congregational Union, he devoted himself to literary work almost exclusively. In November 1881, he became acting pastor (Dr. Hepworth having the care of the pulpit) of the Belleville Avenue Congregational Church in Newark, and this arrangement continued for three years. On February 12, 1883, he had an attack of apoplexy, and was partially paralyzed. He rallied, however, and showed afterwards considerable vigor of mind and body. His infirmities increased with years, and on February 6, 1886, he suffered from a second attack, from which he rallied surprisingly; but on February 20, 1887, a third attack came, and on March 22 a rapid degeneration of the brain began. He died March 29, 1887, at the age of 78. His wife died March 8, 1886; of their ten children, one son, also a graduate of Yale, and two daughters survived him. He received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Union College in 1852. From 1865 to 1878 he was a member of the Board of Visitors of Andover Seminary. He wrote extensively for the quarterlies, and for the literary and religious press generally. He published six or seven volumes in prose, besides numerous discourses, and three or four volumes of hymns and other poems.

He gained a lot of exposure and experience which were vital in his life. His working career took him to Lagos, Enugu and Port Harcourt where he served diligently as a clerk of court before proceeding to the Lincoln‚Äôs Inn for his qualification as a lawyer. On his return from England as a lawyer, he commenced his legal practice, setting up his Law firm in the oil rich city of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. He had a successful career in the legal profession and this won him the respect and admiration of many lawyers. He was elevated to the bench as a High Court Judge in 1962 by the then Eastern Region of Nigeria Government where he served as a Judge of the Eastern Region in cities like Abakaliki, Nsukka, Ikot Ekpene, Umuahia, and Port Harcourt.

According to an oration presented by The Order Of the Knights of Saint Mulumba, KSM, Port Harcourt in honor of His Majesty the King: > ‚ÄúWe recall the crucial role he played as a Catholic in post-war Rivers > state. At the end of the civil war, Catholics generally were haunted in > Rivers state. In spite of this unwholesome phenomenon, he not only stood > firm in the Catholic Church, but also participated and supported the > persecuted clergy. He assisted the Catholic Church immensely in identifying > and recovering some of her properties at the end of the war in Rivers state. > His full participation during Corpus Christi procession, in spite of acute > challenges of age, epitomized his commitment to the Catholic faith.‚Äù Reign His Majesty sat on the throne for 23 years. Upon the creation of Bayelsa state out of the old River state in 1996, he contributed immensely to the success of the newly created state. His Majesty was the Chairman of the Traditional Rulers Council both in Rivers State and in Bayelsa State where he moved to restore peace among the coastal communities.

It was something of a sensation: the first printing sold out in five days, and it was praised by Theodore Roosevelt and Rudyard Kipling, among others. The work as remained in print into the 21st century, although most later editions did not include Shaw's color plates (although they do included the black-and-white illustrations by Marion Satterlee. Shaw also illustrated another of Parsons' books about wildflowers, According to Season (1902) with 32 full-page color plates. Shaw collected specimens of eastern North American wildflowers for the Gray Herbarium as well as for the University of Maine and the New England Botanical Club. She painted watercolors from these specimens‚Äîsometimes in the field‚Äîas well as from specimens collected by botanists like J. Franklin Collins, Merritt Lyndon Fernald, C.D. Lippincott, and Arthur H. Norton. Her \\"wonderfully accurate\\" paintings often show a small grouping of flowers on the stem with their leaves.

It is the eleventh entry of the MLB: The Show franchise, and was released on March 29, 2016, for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. It is the first MLB: The Show entry to not have a portable version, and is the final version available for the PlayStation 3. Then Toronto Blue Jays third baseman and 2015 American League MVP winner Josh Donaldson is featured on the main cover for the game. He also appears on the separate Canadian cover edition, making him the first player to be on both the American and Canadian versions of the game. Jung-ho Kang of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Wei-Yin Chen of the Miami Marlins appear on the Korean and Taiwanese covers, respectively. New features The game features more game modes, such as Road To The Show and an all-new franchise mode. In addition, Conquest Mode and Battle Royale have been added into the game. Conquest Mode Conquest Mode pits the user's Diamond Dynasty team against all 30 MLB teams and their strongholds to capture new territories and eventually all of North America. Each territory is inhabited by fans of the user's team or one of the 30 MLB teams. In order to capture one of the territories, the user must attack the territory by either playing a minimum three-inning game against that team or simulate to avoid playing the game. However, all 30 MLB teams are also trying to capture territories and strongholds, which means the user's team will have to defend its territories and strongholds. Battle Royale Battle Royale is a competitive player-vs- player mode. The user has 25 rounds to draft their best team to go up against opponents to reach the 20-win mark in a double-elimination format, with smaller bonuses awarded for 19-win campaigns. Playing Battle Royale the first time is free, but any other entries cost an additional 1,500 stubs. ShowTime ShowTime is a feature that allows the user to slow down time while batting in clutch situations or making game saving defensive plays. Camera views A new batting camera called \\"Fish Eye\\" is now the default batting camera. It is much wider than last year's version of the batting view as it allows the user to see where all the infielders are lined up. It also allows the user to see where the ball goes in the event the catcher misses the ball.

Life Gaines' Denmark was foaled in 1851. He was a black stallion with two white hind socks, sired by Denmark and out of a mare known as the Stevenson mare. Gaines' Denmark sired four influential sons: Washington Denmark, Diamond Denmark, Star Denmark, and Sumpter Denmark. Upon the start of the American Civil War, Gaines' Denmark was put into a cavalry troop led by Confederate General John Hunt Morgan. Although Gaines' Denmark survived the war, he did not accomplish much as a sire after it. Prior to the war, he was used as a show horse. Today, he is considered one of the progenitors of the modern American Saddlebred.

31, 2013) was a Pennsylvania theologian who became the first woman ordained by the Moravian Church in North America. She also served as a vice president of the Moravian National Council of Churches. Biography Mary Jane Dill was born on August 10, 1931 in Havertown, Pennsylvania to Olive (n√©e Wise) and Charles Dill. Dill was raised in the Lutheran church and after completing her basic schooling in Havertown, she attained a bachelor's degree from Grove City College in Pennsylvania in 1953. Upon completion of her degree, Dill moved to Athens, Ohio, where she became the Director of Christian Education of the First Presbyterian Church. Two years later, on January 8, 1955, she married William W. Matz who was a Moravian pastor. Career The couple began their first pastorate by founding the Hilltop Community Moravian Church close to Utica, New York. Throughout the next sixteen years, they served together in four congregations in the Palmyra Moravian Church at Cinnaminson, New Jersey, Sharon Moravian Church of Tuscarawas, Ohio, Lititz Moravian Church in Lititz, Pennsylvania and Edgeboro Moravian Church at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. When William was offered the opportunity to become Vice President of Moravian College and Dean of the Moravian Theological Seminary, Matz took the opportunity to attend Seminary training. She was ordained as a minister, the first ordained woman in the Moravian Church in America, on February 16, 1975 and graduated 3 months later with her Master of Divinity degree. Matz then served for three years as an assistant pastor in the Central Moravian Church. In 1977, she was appointed as Director of Educational Ministries for the Northern Province of the Moravian Church, a position she held until 1995. Matz earned her doctorate in Ministry from Drew University in Madison, New Jersey in 1982. That same year she published Ministry together: A manual for shared ministry training, a book about pastors and laity working together. To further that goal, she co-founded the Lehigh Valley Lay Academy, a series of spiritual developmental classes for the ministry and laymen. She published a second book in 1990 entitled Choices and values in a rapidly changing world, which focused on Bible study choices for the modern world. Matz held the position of interim pastor with the Lancaster Moravian Church and in the 1990s, shared the interim pastorate in Bethlehem of East Hills Moravian Church with her husband. She was a vice president of the Moravian National Council of Churches and in 1995 was honored with the John Hus Award for outstanding alumni from the Moravian Theological Seminary. Matz died on July 31, 2013, at the Moravian Village, of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

It is designed to deflect a nuclear attack on Moscow and important industrial regions. The main developer of the system is JSC Concern VKO Almaz-Antey. The new system should replace the current one ‚Äî A-135. The two main differences will be that the A-235 will use conventional warheads and it will be mobile. Missile defense system A-235 will be using the Don-2N radar and the range radar Don 2NP / 5N20P with updated software and hardware; the guidance system of the A-235 complex will be similar to the existing system A-135. The A-235, when deployed, could be equipped with a nuclear warhead which would greatly increase its ability to kill incoming warheads. The yield on which it would be deployed is not yet known. According to reports in early 2018, the system will not be equipped with nuclear warheads. According to Russian sources, the system will be deployed at points surrounding Moscow by the end of 2018. The anti-ballistic missile systems are located at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, at the ex-launch site of the Tsyklon-2 rocket. The new PRS-1M (45T6) is a modernized variant of the PRS-1 (53T6 Gazelle) and can use nuclear or conventional warheads. It can hit targets at ranges of 350 km and altitudes of 50 km. The A-235 will have missiles capable of operating at three different ranges: long-range, based on the 51T6 and capable of destroying targets at distances up to 1500 km (930 miles), at altitudes up to 800,000 m; medium-range, an update of the 58R6, designed to hit targets at distances up to 1000 km (620 miles), at altitudes up to 120,000 m; and short-range (the 53T6M or 45T6 (based on the 53T6)), with an operating range of 350 km (215 miles) and a flight ceiling of 40,000-50,000 m. The long- range missiles will most likely be equipped with nuclear warheads, while the others will have kinetic energy warheads. Testing of new missiles for the A-235 Samolyot-M system began in August 2014.  Design  Initially, the A-235 missile defense system was planned to have three-echelons: long-range echelon with the A-925 missile, the middle echelon was the 58R6 firing complex, and the short-range flight was the PRS-1M missiles (the result of the upgrade of the PRS-1 missiles). In the modified A-235 anti-missile and anti- space defense system, it is planned to use two-stage anti-missiles with high- explosive and nuclear warheads, providing it with the ability to shoot down hypersonic attack weapons, hypersonic orbital platforms, ballistic missiles, and their combat units, as well as satellites in near space. Tests On 4 June 2019, the Russian Ministry of Defense posted a video showing the successful interception of the test target which was a test of a new anti- ballistic missile system in the form of a long-range surface to air missile was confirmed. Though the nature of the air defense system which was being tested was not mentioned it has been widely speculated to have been a test of the S-500 Prometheus long-range surface to air missile system which entered early production earlier in the year. However, it also could have been the test of the A-235 anti-ballistic missile system which tests have been conducted on since 2014.  Project history  The task of developing a modernized version of the A-135 missile defense system was set out in Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the USSR No. 585-119 dated 7 June 1978: \\"On the construction of the A-135 system.\\" The system was designed by the Research Institute of Radio Instrument Engineering (NIIRP) of the Vimpel Central Scientific Industrial Association from 1986. Its general designer was A. G. Bassist (until 1998); its chief designer was B. P. Vinogradov (after the death of A. G. Basistov in 1998, B. P. Vinogradov replaced him as the general designer of the NIIRP). By the Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR No. 661-202 15 July 1985, NIIRP, as a subdivision of Vympel, became the leading enterprise of Russia in the multi-echelon ABM system as a whole, in the ground ABM system and the information system for the ABM system. The first draft design of the ABM A-235 system was probably protected in 1985‚Äì1986. The Soviet government signed the state contract No. 406/1591 31 January 1991 with the NIIRP to modernize the missile defense system, work to expand the combat capabilities of the A-135 system in terms of increasing the distant border of the affected area, increasing the maneuverability of the missile, and equipping new missiles to the combat unit (all together known as the OCD \\"Samolet-M\\"). The name of the technical rocket complex of the modernized missile defense system of Moscow was RTTs-181M. Under the state contract, the readiness period of the upgraded version was set for 2015. According to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin No. 163 dated 17 February 1995, the NIIRP was determined as the head enterprise for the modernization and improvement of the Moscow PRO system - the RTC-181 system - and the creation of the RTC-181M system. In 2011, the concern Almaz-Antey developed the working design documentation for the shooting complex 14TS033, the working design documentation for the first stage of the complex 14LS031 radar and the design of functional software. In 2012, the concern Almaz-Antey held an autonomous preliminary test of the components of the complex 14TS033. Experimental and combat training tests of the A-235 were planned to be held in 2013. At that time, experts did not point out any fundamental differences between the A-235 and the A-135 missile defense system. According to foreign media reports, on 18 November 2015, the first successful launch of the Nudol missile and the third launch in the missile test program took place. Presumably, the deployment site of the A-235 missile defense system will be the former base area of the A-135 missile defense system near Moscow. According to the plan, the complex will have the capabilities to intercept the warheads of ballistic missiles, as well as spacecraft. In May 2016, system elements were tested as part of the exercises of the Military Space Forces of the Russian Federation.  Overall project evaluation  As the military expert, reserve colonel M. Hodarenok notes: \\"The A-235 will be a classic version of the missile defense system. A very well-informed source in the MIC [Military-Industrial Complex of Russia] personally told me about the system: 'The work is being done, and very successfully.'\\" Also, according to the expert, due to the secrecy of the project, accurate information on the A-235 system is currently not available, but it can be hypothetically assumed that the following three principles are taken into account in the tactical and technical task: first, the system must be capable of non-nuclear interception, since the earlier anti-missile projects were equipped with a nuclear warhead, which significantly narrowed the scope of their possible use, moreover, the use of anti-missiles with special charges Eski meant the beginning of nuclear war and eliminates the use within the limited armed conflict and other situations of this kind; secondly, the system must be mobile, without a rigid binding to any object or center; thirdly, it must provide interception at an altitude of at least 500‚Äì750 km, that is, at Low Earth orbit.

There is no scientific evidence that eating an apple a day has any significant health effect. Origin A variant of the proverb, \\"Eat an apple on going to bed, and you‚Äôll keep the doctor from earning his bread\\" was recorded as a Pembrokeshire saying in 1866. The current phrasing, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\\", began usage at the end of the 19th century, with early print examples found as early as 1887. Scientific evaluation A 2015 study found no evidence that the proverb was true: adult consumers of one small apple per day had the same number of physician visits as those who did not eat apples. The study also found that people who ate an apple a day used fewer prescription medications. Other than for a moderate amount of carbohydrates as fructose and dietary fiber, a medium-size apple (182 g with skin) supplies 95 calories and 14% of the Daily Value for vitamin C, but otherwise has a low content of micronutrients.

History of golf in Ireland Although most historians agree that the birthplace of golf occurred in Scotland, the sport has a rich and colorful history in Ireland. Dating back to the mid-1800s, one of the fascinating aspects of Ireland's golf history is that many of its oldest courses are still around today, giving players and tourists a first hand account of its history. Today, Ireland is one of the nations with the most golf courses per capita in the world. Golf in the modern world originated from a game played on the eastern coast of Scotland in the Kingdom of Fife during the 15th century. Golf was officially introduced in Scotland in 1421. The game quickly spread throughout Europe due to the royal endorsement of King Charles I who brought the game to England. One of the oldest and most popular courses at the time was the Royal Curragh Golf Club, which opened in 1856. It quickly spread to Ireland from Scotland. Organizations The Professional Golfers‚Äô Association (Great Britain and Ireland) was founded in 1901 and is based out of The Belfry, England. It was established to professionalize careers in golf and grow the golf community in Great Britain and Ireland. The Association initially included 70 members and has now grown to over 7,500. The Golfing Union of Ireland was established in 1891, making it the oldest national golfing union in the world.Menton, William A., (1991) The Golfing Union of Ireland, 1891 - 1991, p.14 It is based out of Carton House, Maynooth. It currently represents 430 golf clubs and 170,000 members, compared with the nine original founding clubs. Union business is conducted by a Central Council and four smaller governing branches: Connacht, Leinster, Munster, and Ulster. The Ladies‚Äô Golf Union of Great Britain and Ireland was founded in 1893, just two years later. It is based out of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. The LGU works to provide women golfers opportunities to participate and compete and to aide British and Irish women in becoming successful golfers, domestically and internationally. The LGU also actively works to attain gender equality in golf and provide a unified voice to work for the interests of women golfers. Tournaments The Irish PGA Championship has been held annually at many of the nation's courses since its founding in 1907. It is the oldest tournament in Ireland. The 2015 champion is Niall Kearney.

International Trophy Notable courses Aerial View of Portmarnock Golf Club and peninsula Ireland has thirty-two different counties, twenty-six in the Republic of Ireland and six in Northern Ireland. There are around 300 different courses. Around the entire coast of Ireland are links-style golf courses, played on sandy soils with firm conditions, often with views of the sea while inland there is a wide variety of parkland courses more usually containing trees and water hazards. There are many historic courses in Ireland, whether that be tournament hosting history such as Portmarnock in the Dublin region, which was home to fifteen Irish Opens or Royal Portrush in County Antrim, the only course in Ireland to have held The Open Championship. There are many clubs and courses that were established in the 19th-Century such as Lahinch in County Clare (1894) and the Royal Curragh Golf Club in Kildare (1858) that still receive great amounts of play and tourism.

This included more than 20,000 rental apartments. Biography Kaskel was born to a Jewish family in Poland and immigrated to the US in the 1930s to New York bringing his siblings with him. Soon after arriving, he began building in New York City eventually building over 17,000 apartments in the city including Gracie Towers and 360 East 72nd Street in Manhattan; Roosevelt Terrace in Jackson Heights, Queens; Churchill Manor in Briarwood, Queens; Park City and Park City Estates in Rego Park, Queens, Kennedy House in Forest Hills, Queens; River Terrace and Skyview apartments in Riverdale, Bronx. Kaskel buildings were some of the first in New York City to have sunken living rooms, terraces, and outdoor corridors. Most of his buildings were designed by architect Philip Birnbaum. Kaskel also developed The Anita Apartments, The Carol Apartments, and The Howard Apartments in Rego Park, Queens, which he named after each of his children. Kaskel's children later reciprocated when they developed The Alfred, a 38-story condominium tower in Manhattan, in his name. Kaskel was perhaps best known for founding Doral Hotels & Resorts, which developed, owned and operated luxury hotels including the Doral Golf Resort and Spa, Doral Miami Beach, Carillon Miami, Doral Telluride Resort and Spa, Doral Inn, Doral Tuscany, Doral Park Avenue, and Doral Arrowwood, among others. The city of Doral in Florida is named after the Doral Miami Beach and its sister hotel Doral Golf Resort and Spa, which is also home to the Doral Open. The name was created by Doris (n√©e Bernstein) and Alfred Kaskel, combining \\"Dor\\" and \\"Al\\" from each of their names. Alfred's last major development was 90 Park Avenue, a 41-story office building and skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan located at 40th Street and Park Avenue, two blocks from Grand Central.

He was sent to Rome in 156 BCE, to inform the Roman Senate that Prusias II of Bithynia had attacked the territories of Attalus.Polybius, The Histories xxxii. 26. Prusias later sent his son Nicomedes II of Bithynia, along with an assistant named Menas, to Rome in 149 to appeal to the Senate, and ask them to cancel the fine they had earlier levied on Prusias for attacking Attalus. Unbeknownst to Nicomedes, Menas had been given orders to assassinate Nicomedes if he failed. Attalus again sent Andronicus to Rome, to oppose this diplomatic request, and demonstrate why the fine was fair. Menas, seeing that Nicomedes would fail, but was also too popular at Rome to assassinate, feared to either carry out his mission or return to Prusias if he did not carry it out. He called Nicomedes and Andronicus into a meeting and explained the plot to them, and in which the three conspired against Prusias, with the end goal of replacing Prusias on the throne with Nicomedes. Though it is speculated by some scholars that winning over the heir to the Bithynian throne was already part of Andronicus's agenda at that point. The three set sail from Ostia Antica and met at the city of Berenice, in Epirus, where Andronicus and his soldiers hailed Nicomedes as king of Bithynia, and promised the assistance of Attalus.Appian, Mithr. 4, &c; Notes People from Pergamon 2nd-century BC Greek people ","title":"Andronicus of Pergamum"},{"id":"48739316","text":"Annie Martin is a Canadian artist who works with installation, audio, video and textiles.

The path between the two European capitals takes approximately 75 minutes.  History  The Twin City Liner in Vienna The first catamaran was built in Norway between the autumn of 2005 and the spring of 2006. The routing was across Skagerrak, on the Northern Sea after the channel Rhine-Main-Danube to Vienna. For this and due to the weight, the shipyard of Norwegian B√•tservice Mandal developed a high speed catamaran in aluminium with a hydrojet which can also be used in summer at low tide. The sinking depth in water guaranteed by the contract is 80 cm. To minimize the impact of the waves, complex model tests of the Austrian Institute for Maritime Technology (Schiffbautechnische Versuchsanstalta) took place. The catamaran is totally climate-controlled, and can accommodate 106 passengers and crew (a captain, two sailors and catering staff). On May 14, 2007, the Twin City Liner failed in Vienna, in the district of Erdberg, on the right bank of the Danube Canal and had to be rescued by firemen from Vienna. After repair and administrative authorization, it was returned to service. A similar accident occurred July 28, 2009, when the captain tried to avoid a floating tree trunk near the gateway Erdberg. During a press conference on August 20, 2007, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Affairs and Finance Vienna Renate Brauner discussed the acquisition of the second Twin City Liner. This second \\"Twinni,\\" as nicknamed by the media, was also built by B√•tservice Mandal and made the same journey. On May 13, 2008, the Twin City Liner docked in the central port of Vienna below Reichsbr√ºcke. The maiden voyage of the new catamaran, with the registration number A-40631, was conducted immediately after its christening by President Heinz Fischer and his wife Margit Fischer, and the priest of the Cathedral of Vienna Anton Faber, as part of a state visit to Bratislava. During a stopover in Dev√≠n, Slovak President Ivan Gasparovic and his wife boarded the ship and then continued the journey. The Twin City Liner in Bratislava Besides minor changes to the technical equipment and form, the new Twin City Liner can accommodate up to 126 passengers: 106 seats forward in the passenger cabin, eight seats in the \\"VIP\\" cabin on the upper deck and twelve outdoor seats for travel during the summer. The commercial operation of the second Twin City Liner began 31 August 2008. There have been studies conducted for the purchase of a third vessel to develop a fast connection based on the Twin City Liner to Budapest or Belgrade. From Bratislava, travelers might go to Piestany or contemporary art museum Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum to ƒåunovo. In January 2019, it was announced that a new, larger Twin City Liner would begin operating on March 29, 2019. This Twin City Liner was built in England by Wightshipyard. It took 62,000 working hours, 25 tons of aluminium, and 60 square meters of window glass to complete the 7 million euro vessel. It is powered by four Di16 V8 Scania 4400BHP Ehardt engines, and four Kamewa Rolls-Royce jets. Twin City Liner 3 Length : 39.9 meters Width : 11 meters Height : 5.9 meters Draft : 0.8 meters Dead weight : 70 tons Seats : 250 Captain's Lounge: 35 Top speed : 81 km / h Cruise speed : 60 km / h Power : 4400 hp  Route and timetables  Unlike most other ships sailing on the Danube, the Twin City Liner does not leave the port of Reichsbr√ºcke but the station in the city center, on the Danube canal between Schwedenplatz and Marienbr√ºcke (Vienna) to bypass the dam of the power plant Freudenau. In July 2010, a new wharf was opened. The arrival point in Bratislava is only a few minutes walk from the old town. The ships sail from May to September four to five times a day in each direction, and in April and October, three to four times. Besides the planned operating hours (evenings and from mid - December to April), ships can be chartered.  Users  Users are mainly tourists and inhabitants of Vienna and Bratislava, mostly businessmen. As seats are limited booking favors roundtrips between morning and evening. In addition, the ticket price depends on the day of the week.  Owner  The ship owner is the Central Danube Region GmbH, which initiated and developed the project. The partners are as operators DDSG Blue Danube, belonging to the Wien Holding which includes the businesses run by the city of Vienna.

Semantic processing causes us to relate the word we just heard to other words with similar meanings. Once a word is perceived, it is placed in a context mentally that allows for a deeper processing. Therefore, semantic processing produces memory traces that last longer than those produced by shallow processing since shallow processing produces fragile memory traces that decay rapidly. Semantic processing is the deepest level of processing and it requires the listener to think about the meaning of the cue. Studies on brain imaging have shown that, when semantic processing occurs, there is increased brain activity in the left prefrontal regions of the brain that does not occur during different kinds of processing. One study used MRI to measure the brain activity of subjects while they made semantic decisions. The participants then took a memory test after a short period of time. When the subjects showed high confidence and correctly retained the information, the fMRI measured increased activity in the left prefrontal regions. Convergent semantic processing Convergent semantic processing occurs during tasks that elicit a limited number of responses. During these tasks, subjects must suppress alternate options in order to select a single best option from a multitude of choices. It is believed that the left hemisphere of the brain dominates convergent semantic processing due to the fine grained, small window of temporal integration. Spatially, neurons in the left hemispheres occupy mutually exclusive regions, allowing for the more fine- tuned response seen in convergent semantic processing. Neurons in the left hemisphere The left hemisphere quickly selects the most familiar meaning or response, while suppressing other closely related meanings. In addition, when presented with an ambiguous word with no context, the left hemisphere will prime the most frequent meaning of the word. Studies of patients with left hemisphere damage have demonstrated a disruption of convergent semantic processing, causing subjects to associate words with abstract, non-literal meanings produced by the right hemisphere. For example, a subject with left hemisphere damage may affiliate the word ‚Äúdeep‚Äù with ‚Äúwise‚Äù rather than its literal antonym ‚Äúshallow.‚Äù Examples of convergent processing Experimenter instructs the subject to select an infinite verb that most accurately describes the function of each stimuli. ;Stimulus/Verb Hammer/To Pound, Needle/To Sew, Bat/To Swing, Sponge/To Scrub, Basketball/To Shoot, Pencil/To Write Divergent semantic processing Divergent semantic processing occurs during linguistic tasks that can elicit a large variety of responses. During these tasks, listeners produce different possible meanings and list all the other words that come to their minds. It is believed that the right hemisphere of the brain commands divergent semantic processing through its coarse grained, large windows of temporal integration. Neurons in the right hemisphere occupy overlapping regions of space, allowing for the network activation of concepts necessary for divergent processing. Neurons in the right hemisphere The right hemisphere activates concepts that are more loosely associated with a stimulus, allowing for production of non-literal and less frequent meanings of words. For example, when presented with an ambiguous word without context, the right hemisphere primes less frequent meaning of the word. Studies of patient with right hemisphere damage have demonstrated a disruption of divergent semantic processing, causing subjects to affiliate words with concrete, literal meanings produced by the left hemisphere. For example, a subject with right hemisphere damage will group the word ‚Äúdeep‚Äù with its antonym ‚Äúshallow,‚Äù and have trouble producing the non-literal association of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù with ‚Äúwise.‚Äù Examples of divergent processing Experimenter instructs the subject to produce as many verbs as possible for each stimuli. ;Stimulus Basketball ;Verbs To shoot, to pass, to throw, to dribble, to steal, to block, to tip, to spin, etc. References Semantics ","title":"Semantic processing"},{"id":"48739344","text":"Christel Lee (born on October 25, 1990, Bloomington, Indiana, United States) is a Korean American-Canadian violinist.

Allebach was the first woman ever chosen from Kings County, New York, to be a delegate to a national political convention. She was chosen for the 1912 Republican National Convention held in Chicago but was not allowed to attend. She was a delegate from the Eighteenth Assembly District of the State Convention of the Progressive Party at Syracuse.  Early life and education  Ann Jemima Allebach was born on May 8, 1874 in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and grew up near Schwenksville. Her parents were Sarah Markley Allebach and Jacob R. Allebach, who was a banker and postmaster. As a child, she founded a chapter of Young People's Society of Christian Endeavour in her hometown. In 1893, she became a principal of a school in East Orange, New Jersey, and began her college studies. She studied at Ursinus College, New York University, Columbia University, and Union Theological Seminary. Career Following her studies, she taught at Perkiomen Seminary in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania. Ordination She requested ordination from the minister of her home church and a minister in Philadelphia. They agreed to her request, though the culture in that part of Pennsylvania would remain generally opposed to women ministers for several decades. She was ordained on 15 January 1911 at the First Mennonite Church in Philadelphia. Following her ordination, she returned to New York City, living in Brooklyn. In June 1913 she said:‚Äî Right to preach and suffrage After returning to New York City, she spoke out about women's right to preach, and was also outspoken in supporting women's right to vote. In Brooklyn, she preached at the Marcy Avenue Baptist Church from 1913‚Äì1915. She also ministered to the poor, and was asked by the Mayor of New York to organize a conference on home religion and social services. She was frequently invited back to Pennsylvania to preach. In 1916, she was called to be the minister for the Sunnyside Reformed Church on Long Island. Death and legacy On April 27, 1918, she died of a heart attack. She was the first ordained female Mennonite minister in North America.

Its common name is snow flea. It has stubby, grey-brown wings with a metallic sheen. Snow fleas crawl or hop over the snow at temperatures around freezing point and thus resemble glacier fleas and snow flies. The males have 4 short, wing vestiges which curve downwards at their ends. The females only have two scale-like wing vestiges. In general, the female may be recognised from a curved, sabre-like pipe that acts as an ovipositor. In their fully formed state, these animals are only found in the colder period of the year between October and March. During this time mating takes place. The larvae live on moss-covered areas and withdraw in September into holes in the group to pupate.  Sources   Alfred Edmund Brehm: D√§ggdjurens Lif. Em. Girons, Stockholm 1882, pp. 145f.

Ports by Andromeda Software were released for the Atari ST in 1987 and NEC PC-9801 in 1989. A game titled Colonial Conquest II was released for Amiga in 1994, but is entirely unrelated to the original game by SSI.  Game mechanics  left Based on the principles of Risk (but without dice rolling), in Colonial Conquest, the player controls armies and ship in order to take control of the world. The game matches the historical context of the Scramble for Africa and the scenario begins in the year 1880. The player can select one of the six major powers of the time: England, Germany, France, United States, Japan, and Russia. The land and naval forces of each country have different attack and defense values, as well as different costs: For example, Russia spends three times less money for the recruitment of its ground troops than England but in return the Russian offensive and defensive value will be much lower than that of their British counterparts. Three scenarios are available: * Standard Game (None Of the Major Countries has any overseas colonies) * 1880: Race For The Colonies (beginning of the large-scale colonization) * 1914: Brink Of the War (the forces of the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance clash)  Reception  Stewart McKames reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"Colonial Conquest is not a serious recreation of the colonial era. What it is, is a challenging and enjoyable multi-player or solitaire game. While containing the flavor of the period, it plays easily and gives ample opportunity for the Diplomat or the General in you to stab your opponents, conquer territories, and build an Empire on which the sun never sets.\\" Robbie Robberson reviewed Colonial Conquest in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 77.

One of the three victims was seriously injured, and the other two sustained minor stab wounds. The attacker was named as 29-year-old Muhaydin Mire of Leytonstone, who was found guilty of attempted murder in June 2016. After originally being classed as terrorism, the classification was later removed after the investigation concluded that the main motive was mental illness, albeit inspired by ISIL-propaganda.  Incident  The Metropolitan Police were called by reports of a stabbing incident at Leytonstone station, where a male suspect was reportedly threatening other people with a bread knife. During the attack, the suspect was reported to have declared, \\"This is for Syria, my Muslim brothers\\" and shouted, \\"All your blood will be spilled\\". Some bystanders threw bottles at the perpetrator while another shouted, \\"Put it down [the knife], you fool\\". A bystander received a cut to his neck while confronting the perpetrator. A junior doctor, who was passing the scene, tended to the wounded victim to control his bleeding, and praised the \\"brave people\\" who confronted the perpetrator. At 19:14, the suspect was arrested and taken to a police station in east London where he was placed in custody. A Taser was twice used, once without effect, by one of the officers during the arrest. Police said that one victim had sustained serious, but not life- threatening, knife injuries, and two others were later treated for minor injuries.  Attacker  Muhaydin Mire, a 29-year-old who had moved to the UK from Somalia as a child and lived in Leytonstone, appeared at the Old Bailey on 7 December 2015 and was charged with attempted murder of the 56-year-old man who was seriously injured. Mire was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for examination to determine his state of mind. Mire's mental state became a central point in his trial and post-event evaluations. He was reported to have a history of paranoid psychotic episodes, and was in hospital for three months as a result of the first of these in 2006. After moving to Leytonstone he had to stop working \\"because of anxiety, panic attacks, and depression\\", and four days before the attack he had missed an appointment with a community mental health worker because of \\"delusions that he was being followed by MI5 and MI6 agents\\". His brother said that he had relapsed in August 2015 and that he used to telephone him with odd, delusional messages, but not with a political theme. Around a month before the attack, Mire's family had sought urgent medical help trying to get him sectioned, but this was rejected by authorities, who found him to be of no risk to himself or others. The police later issued a statement: \\"The police were contacted by a family member approximately three weeks before the incident on Saturday. There was no mention of radicalisation; the conversation related entirely to health-related issues and the family were therefore correctly referred to health services for help.\\" As a final resort, Mire's brother \\"decided to move him out the country [to see his mother]...I decided to book a ticket for him on this Sunday. He was okay as far as I know. He wanted to go\\". In June 2016, Mire was convicted of attempted murder and admitted four counts of attempted wounding. In July he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of eight and a half years and started to serve his term at Broadmoor Hospital.  Aftermath and responses  In a video of the alleged perpetrator being subdued by police, a bystander subsequently identified by the first name John shouted, \\"You ain't no Muslim, bruv. You ain't no Muslim. You're an embarrassment.\\" John, whose full name has not been made public and who is not a Muslim, told The Sunday Times, \\"I saw the guy. I was like, well you ain't a Muslim ... That's my views, and I had to let him know that.\\" He added, \\"People look at Muslims, and look at Isis, and think they're all the same. But obviously they're not\\". Consequently, the hashtag #YouAintNoMuslimBruv trended on Twitter, becoming the top trending topic in the UK on the morning following the attack. The Guardian noted that it was a \\"perfect riposte to attempts to spread violence and terror in London.\\" The Independent stated the \\"phrase has become a unifying call among people condemning the attack on social media.\\" On 7 December, the phrase was repeated by British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said in a speech, \\"Some of us have dedicated speeches and media appearances and sound-bites and everything to this subject but 'you ain't no Muslim, bruv' says it all, much better than I ever could and thank you because that will be applauded all around the country.\\"  Reactions  Local MP for Leyton and Wanstead, John Cryer of the Labour Party, described the attack as \\"barbaric\\" but stated it would be \\"dangerous\\" to directly link it to the British airstrikes against ISIS in Syria without proof. Imam Imran Patel, of Leytonstone Mosque, said that the perpetrator was \\"not a member of the congregation of Leytonstone and for his actions he can only answer for himself. We strongly condemn any sort of violence and terrorism. Islam does not allow, and does not have any place for violent acts\\". Kenan Malik describes the Leytonstone attack as part of \\"degeneration\\" of Islamist attacks from highly coordinated terrorism like the November 2015 Paris attacks to \\"low-tech\\" attacks with blade weapons and vehicles, a shift that brings into focus \\"the difficulty ... in drawing a distinction between jihadi violence and the fury of disturbed minds\\".

He spent most of his academic career as Professor of Geography at Indiana University, Department of Geology. His interests included the geography of intelligence, ecology and the historical geography of Indiana ‚Äì on which he wrote prolifically (C. Lavery, 2015). After his death he was called the \\"Mr Geography of Indiana\\" as a result of the many articles and books he wrote concerning the Hoosier State (J. Rose, 1971). His interests in eugenics influenced in the work of Ellsworth Huntington, while his geographical work and stories of eastern travel was one of the main reasons Pulitzer Prize winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle began traveling to the Far East (O. Johnson, 2011). Early life Visher was born in Chicago to a second generation Dutch immigrant (father) and a New Hampshire native (mother). Irregular school attendance did not diminish his interest in the physical environment, human settlement and animal and plant ecology (C. Harris, 1968). His early interest in these fields laid the foundations for his later research into the influence of the environment on humanity (C. Lavery, 2015). He spent most of his teenage years living between South Dakota and Chicago ‚Äì where he attended the Lewis Institute to pursue a course in geology and biology. He was then awarded an undergraduate degree in botany and a master's degree in geology at the University of Chicago in 1910. Geographical work Visher's early geographical work was heavily influenced by Ellen Churchill Semple's widely-read Influences of Geographic Environment (1911) ‚Äì so much so that he introduced much of Semple's thinking into his geography course at Indiana University in 1919 (Keighren, 2010). He was particularly interested in the fields of anthropogeography and environmental determinism. He borrowed from these geographical trends to help explain, for example, the historic development of urban areas and the 'geography of notables' (S. Visher, 1928). In addition, the works of ecologist Harlan Barrows and sociologist George Vincent stirred Visher's interests in social evolution, educational attainment, civic sciences and the spatial nature of intelligence (C. Lavery, 2015). With Ellsworth Huntington, Visher's attention focused more and more on climatological changes and the effect on life on earth. In Climatic Changes, their Nature and Causes (1922) the authors claimed that changes in solar activity has had significant effects on earth's climate. They also speculated that this was a chief (or at least important) driver of evolution (J. Fleming, 1998, 105). For instance, they speculated that dynamic solar activity 'may be regarded as the great terrestrial contribution to the climatic environment which guides the development of life' (Huntington and Visher 1922, 240). As a regional geographer, Visher was concerned about spatial variation. The variability of 'social conditions' or the 'quality of the population' were explained by Visher by invoking environmental explanations (S. Visher, 1931, 757). He suggested, for instance, that the climate, land-use, soil fertility and relief of the land were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration to give a fuller explanation of social and biological differences. Combining this approach with his support of the eugenics movement, Visher set about trying to explain why some areas of the United States have a larger proportion of intelligent people (or 'notables' as he called them) than other areas. As Lavery (2015) has demonstrated, Visher used statistics from American Men of Science and Who's Who in America to claim that \\"the Northern and Eastern states contained disproportionately more 'notables' than any other areas of the country\\". On this national scale, Visher's explanation of this observation was that the climate of the Northern states is more conducive to intellectual development, while the Southern states suffered from what he called 'an enervating climate' (S. Visher, 1922, 446). On the smaller, regional scale climate played less of an intrusive role. Instead, in his view, the social, political and economic environment went some way to determine intelligence and academic achievement. Achievements Visher was an active geographer; and, in terms of publications, one of the most productive in the United States throughout the 1930s and 1940s. His work was recognized nationally and internationally. He was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale in 1920; he was elected vice president of the American Association of Geographers in 1931 and president of the Indiana Academy of Science in 1950; and held visiting professorships at Cornell University, and the Universities of Colorado and British Columbia (C. Lavery, 2015). References *Fleming, J. (1998) Historical Perspectives on Climate Change, New York: Oxford University Press, 105 *Harris, C. D.

Through the efforts of Baldo de Bonafarii and Sibilla de Cetto, the convent of the Friars Minor and the Hospital of Saint Francis, Major (or Greater), operated until 1798. History Bell tower and facade seen from via Santa Sofia. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1967. The Dec. 29, 1414, before the Bishop of Padua, the Bishop Pietro Marcello and other witnesses, Bonafari Baldo and his wife Sybil from Cetto declared they want to allocate part of their property to the construction of a church and monastery with a hospital in Santa Contr√† Margaret, to be allocated to the Friars Minor. Bonafari reserved the right to elect the rector of the hospital, which on his death would go to the College of Lawyers of the University of Padua. The foundation stone was laid on 25 October 1416 by the Archpriest of the Cathedral, Bartholomew of Astorelli. The church in the parish of San Lorenzo at first caused some uncertainty; until the Bishop agreed to allow the work to continue. Master builder Nicholas Gobbo led the project. After the death of Bonafari the work was completed by his wife Sybil. In his will of November 1421, Bonafari asked to be buried in the new church. The building was built on a Latin cross, in Gothic style; it was consecrated on October 24, 1430. In the middle of the fifteenth century the chronicler Savonarola calls templum quidem magnum but at the end of the century it was already insufficient for the community of Minors. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the church was enlarged in the direction of the architect Lorenzo da Bologna. The fifteenth-century church ‚Äì a Latin cross with three apses divided by the choir and nave, three chapels communicating on the left side ‚Äì was widely enlarged: it was built a large sanctuary that welcomed new large choir stalls. The fifteenth-century nave was flanked by two wide aisles with chapels. The church was now the subject of great works of tone evergetico that enriched the building especially in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. In 1728 the Bishop of Padua counted 22 altars, which had declined to 17 during the visit of Bishop Dondi Clock in 1809. Due to the Napoleonic suppressions the community of Friars Observant left the building and the convent in April 1810 and in the same year it became parish church organized by the secular clergy. Absorbed in the parish of St. Stephen, then in 1808 into the parish of San Lorenzo and San Giorgio. In 1862 the floor was restored with the removal of the many tombstones which were there. The cloisters were also cleared of tombstones. In 1873 the church was the subject of a total restoration. In 1914 the Friars Minor returned to the church and part of the old convent and took possession of the parish still in their care. It submits to the parish with the title of the Oratory Church of Santa Margherita and parish property is also the School of Charity. Exterior The porch A \\"Verdeterra\\" of Francesco Squarcione.

The first rendering garnered praise from critics, and won the first-place prize at the Academy of Fine Arts' annual art exhibition in Vienna in 1882. Given its success, Jovanoviƒá was granted an Austro-Hungarian government scholarship and entered into a contract with the French Gallery in London to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life. Art historians consider The Wounded Montenegrin one of Jovanoviƒá's best Orientalist works. Jovanoviƒá went on to complete three further versions of the composition in the ensuing decades, three of which are oil paintings. The first is currently on display at the Gallery of Matica Srpska in Novi Sad, the second and third are in private collections, and the fourth is housed at the Museum of Yugoslav History in Belgrade. Description The original oil painting measures . It shows a muscular, wounded youth surrounded by ten peasants in a humble, single-room dwelling. The peasants wear hand-sewn shirts, rough leggings and leather shoes. They stand over a dirt floor, and in the background, a collection of eating utensils hang precariously from a makeshift shelf. The youth is cradled in the arms of a crouching, shaved-headed warrior. The two are surrounded by a pair of heavily armed men on either side of them. Nearby, a light-haired girl quietly grieves. To the right of these figures stands a grief-stricken old man, himself surrounded by a number of figures in folk attire. To the far right, two figures can be seen standing inauspiciously in the shadows. The artist's signature, rendered as Joanowits P., can be found at the bottom right. Jovanoviƒá composed a total of four versions of The Wounded Montenegrin, three oil paintings and one sketch. What distinguishes the first rendering from subsequent versions is its size (it is the largest by far), detailed precision, and the artist's removal of the two figures seen lingering in the shadows in the original. The second version, an oil painting, measures . The artist's signature, P. Ivanovitch, can be seen at the bottom right. The third rendition is a sketch measuring , with the artist's signature, Pa. Jo., at the bottom right. The fourth version, another oil painting, measures . The artist's signature, Paul Ivanovitch, can be seen at the bottom right. Jovanoviƒá did not assign titles to his works, as he felt that if a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles. The Wounded Montenegrin also appears under the titles The Wounded Herzegovinian (Ranjeni Hercegovac), The Wounded Bosnian (Ranjeni Bosanac), Sad Encounter (≈Ωalosni susret), Sad Farewell (≈Ωalosni rastanak) and Unsuccessful Banditry (Neuspelo razbojni≈°tvo). History Background Paja Jovanoviƒá, Paja Jovanoviƒá (1859‚Äì1957) was one of the most prominent Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold M√ºller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanoviƒá the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. M√ºller encouraged Jovanoviƒá to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that M√ºller instructed Jovanoviƒá to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting. Orientalist works, vignettes of \\"exotic life\\" in the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans, were quite popular with Central and Western European art collectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time of The Wounded Montenegrin's composition, events in the Balkans had been making headline news in European capitals for decades. The Montenegrins had fought and lost the 1861‚Äì62 Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War. This was followed by about a decade of peace, but in 1872, the Ottomans massacred more than 20 Montenegrins. The Herzegovina Uprising of 1875 prompted Montenegro and Serbia to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, sparking the Great Eastern Crisis of 1875‚Äì78. The wars ended in the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, but occasional cross-border skirmishing continued until the early 1880s. Although Jovanoviƒá never specified, it is likely the painting is set during the 1876‚Äì78 Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War. Provenance Jovanoviƒá composed the first, and most famous, version of The Wounded Montenegrin in 1882 while studying at the Vienna Academy. It was sold to a merchant named Schwartz in Vienna later that year. Within several months, Schwartz sold the painting to a Budapest casino for 1,000 florins. After World War II, it came into the possession of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, which gifted it to the Gallery of Matica Srpska in 1971, where it is on permanent display. It is catalogued under inventory code –ì–ú–° Y/3912. The second version of The Wounded Montenegrin was composed in 1891. It was initially owned by Arthur Toot & Sons, a London art dealer, before coming into the possession of the Salon. Afterwards, it entered into a private collection, and remained in private ownership until 1989, when it was auctioned off at Sotheby's. Between 1989 and 1997, it was housed at a museum in Rome, but sold again thereafter. It is currently in a private collection. The third version, composed after 1900, is part of a private collection. The fourth, painted in the 1920s, was in a private collection until World War II. After the war, it was confiscated by the communists. Following the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, it was put on display at Tito's mausoleum, the House of Flowers. It is currently on display at the Museum of Yugoslav History, and catalogued under the inventory code 59 R. Analysis In line with M√ºller's advice, Jovanoviƒá avoided creating a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed during his time in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first- hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanoviƒá thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with M√ºller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanoviƒá adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion. Filipovitch-Robinson praises Jovanoviƒá's \\"skillful handling\\" of linear and aerial perspective. She notes that the work is devoid of the \\"studio-contrived quality\\" of other Orientalist paintings, and argues that Jovanoviƒá's main goal was not to depict a particular historical event but rather to remind his audience of the Balkan peoples' ongoing struggle against the Ottoman Turks and provide a human face to those engaged in that struggle. Reception and legacy The painting was first shown in public in 1882, at the Vienna Academy's annual student exhibition, which exhibited works produced during the 1881‚Äì82 academic year. It was well received by art critics and Jovanoviƒá's peers, who judged it to be the exhibition's finest work and bestowed him the first-place prize. Jovanoviƒá also received an Austro-Hungarian government scholarship. The exact amount accorded to the artist is disputed. Petar Petroviƒá, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, writes that the scholarship amounted to 300 florins. Art historians Radmila Antiƒá and Nikola Kusovac state the scholarship amounted to 1,000 florins. Jovanoviƒá's triumph at the student exhibition and the subsequent scholarship gave him the means to travel over the summer holidays, during which he came up with a number of ideas for future paintings, such as The Fencing Lesson (Maƒçevanje). Winning the Vienna Academy prize established him as a respected painter of Orientalist works and set the stage for further recognition and success. In 1883, Jovanoviƒá entered into a contract with Ernest Gambart's French Gallery in London to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life. This contract assured him lifelong financial security. Art historians consider The Wounded Montenegrin to be one of Jovanoviƒá's best Orientalist works. Petroviƒá calls it the \\"crowning achievement\\" of the artist's studies under M√ºller. Jovanoviƒá went on to paint a number of other Orientalist pieces, notably The Snake Charmer (1887).
