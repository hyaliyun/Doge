Morrison, P.Eng. (1902‚Äì1993) was a university professor, innovative engineer, magazine editor, co-founder of the North American firm Morrison Hershfield, and president of a standards association. He was considered to be a touchstone for professional ethics and morality in engineering. He is remembered for his ideas and advice, knowledge and imagination. Early life and education Morrison was born on a farm in File Hills, in what is now Saskatchewan but then, in 1902, was called the Northwest Territories. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in Structural Engineering. He later taught there part-time and then continued on to McGill University where he received his Master of Science degree in Structural Engineering. His masters thesis (1927) is titled \\"The Effect of the Manner of Support and of Certain Details of Construction on the Secondary Stresses in a Roof Truss\\". Working life Morrison was a Civil Engineering and Mathematics Lecturer, University of Alberta (1927‚Äì1928). He was with the University of Toronto from 1928 to 1968, first as a Lecturer and later as a Professor. His primary teachings were in the field of civil engineering. His knowledge and interests particularly lied in wood structures and guyed towers. During the post-war years Morrison, along with fellow engineers Charles Hershfield, Joe Millman, and Mark Huggins responded to the building boom by establishing the firm Morrison Hershfield Millman and Huggins in Toronto in 1946. At that time the firm offered civil, structural, and mechanical engineering services. With the company until the time of his death in 1993, Morrison's roles included that of Principal, President and Chairman. The firm eventually grew to become the North American company Morrison Hershfield, providers and integrators of specialized multidisciplinary engineering and related expertise. As a result of the engineering expertise of Morrison Hershfield's co-founders, many of the projects were investigations and problem solving. An early project undertaken by Morrison was to provide a solution to the \\"galloping\\" of the guys supporting the newly constructed radio antenna array towers at the Canadian International Service short wave transmitter at Sackville, New Brunswick. This phenomenon results under specific climatic conditions which causes the guys to oscillate in a dramatic fashion. Failure to provide appropriate damping exposes the structure to serious risk. Morrison was also a published author and editor. One book he published that was of significant impact on the engineering community was \\"Professional Engineering Practice: Ethical Aspects\\" (1982). This book covered topics ranging from the Structure of the Code of Ethics to, Professional Engineers in the Manufacturing Industry, to International Engineering Work. Updated versions of this book are still used in engineering programs today as a basic guide to professional conduct. Morrison was the founding editor of Canadian Consulting Engineer magazine and took a lead in establishing the Canadian Consulting Engineering awards. He held the role of editor from 1959 to 1978. From 1973 to 1975, Morrison was president of Canadian Standards Association. Notable projects * Pinetree Line and Mid-Canada Line site supervision and engineering in Ontario's far north * Widening of the Leaside Bridge in Toronto, Ontario * Investigation into the tragic 1959 collapse of the Listowel Arena, Listowel Ontario, which took 8 lives. This led to changes in the building codes to recognize the effects of non-uniform snow loading, together with the establishment of a requirement for regular inspection of all arenas. * Investigation into the 1966 collapse of Heron Road Bridge in Ottawa, Ontario. The collapse took nine lives. Using two models, Morrison demonstrated that a properly-braced falsework could hold two times the weight of one with inadequate bracing. Just like the bridge, which was under construction at the time, the model that was not properly braced crashed to the ground. * Site selection for the Prince Albert Radar Laboratory in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Awards and achievements * Honorary Member, Ontario Association of Architects, 1963 * Professional Engineering Gold Medal, Professional Engineers Ontario, 1974 * Elected as a Fellow of the Engineering Institute of Canada, 1974 * Canadian Silver Jubilee Medal, 1977 * The Canadian Standards Association John Jenkins Award, 1980 * Association of Consulting Engineers of Canada / Canadian Consulting Engineer Magazine Carson F. Morrison Award, 1984 (an award named in Morrison's honour) * Professional Engineers Ontario admitted Carson Morrison to the Order of Honour in 1984. The highest distinction, the rank of Companion recognizes contributions that exceed those of Officer. It is exclusively given to individuals who have profoundly influenced the engineering profession through their service. * Standards Council of Canada Jean-Paul Carriere Award, 1984. Awarded for distinguished service to Canadian standardization.

The result can potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is the basis of information security. The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A \\"passive attack\\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources, compromising confidentiality. A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger enabling the exploitation of a vulnerability. A threat can be either \\"intentional\\" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or \\"accidental\\" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an \\"act of God\\" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado). A set of policies concerned with information security management, the information security management systems (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to risk management principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.  Countermeasures Against Physical Attacks  If a potential malicious actor has physical access to a computer system, they have a greater chance of inflicting harm upon it. = Electronic Destruction Devices = Devices such as a USB Killer may be used to damage or render completely unusable anything with a connection to the motherboard of a computer, such as a USB port, video port, Ethernet port, or serial port. Without proper protection, these devices may result in the destruction of ports, adapter cards, storage devices, RAM, motherboards, CPUs, or anything physically connected to the device attacked, such as monitors, flash drives, or wired switches. These types of devices can even be used to damage smartphones and cars, as well. This threat can be mitigated by not installing or restricting physical access to easily accessible ports in situations where they are not necessary. A port-closing lock which permanently disables access to a port short of the actual port being disassembled. When it is necessary for a port to be accessible, an optocoupler can allow for a port to send and receive data to a computer or device without a direct electrical connection, preventing the computer or device from receiving any dangerous voltage from an external device. = Hard Drives and Storage = In an unsecured scenario, a malicious actor may steal or destroy storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, resulting in the destruction or theft of valuable data. If the data of a storage device is no longer necessary, data theft is best prevented against by physically destroying or shredding the storage device. If the data of a storage device is in use and must be secured, one can use encryption to encrypt the contents of a storage device, or even encrypt the whole storage device save for the master boot record. The device can then be unlocked with a password, biometric authentication, a physical dongle, a network interchange, a one-time password, or any combination thereof. If this device is a boot drive, however, it must be unencrypted in a pre-boot environment so the operating system can be accessed. Striping, or breaking data into chunks stored upon multiple drives which must be assemble in order to access the data, is a possible solution to physical drive theft, provided that the drives are stored in multiple, individually secured locations, and are enough in number that no one drive can be used to piece together meaningful information. Not to be neglected is the process of adding physical barriers to the storage devices themselves. Locked cases or physically hidden drives, with a limited number of personnel with knowledge and access to the keys or locations, may prove to be a good first line against physical theft.

Background =Origins= A comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azeris are more related to the people of Georgia, than they are to other Iranians, as well as to Armenians. However the same multidimensional scaling plot shows that Azeris from the Caucasus, despite their supposed common origin with Iranian Azeris, cluster closer with other Iranians (e.g. Persians, etc.) than they do with Iranian Azeris.Derenko, M., Malyarchuk, B., Bahmanimehr, A., Denisova, G., Perkova, M., Farjadian, S., & Yepiskoposyan, L. (2013). Complete Mitochondrial DNA Diversity in Iranians . PLoS ONE, 8(11), e80673. Other studies support that present day Iranian main genetic stock comes from the ancient autochthonous people and a genetic input from eastern people would be a minor one. Thus, Iranian Azeris have the closest genetic distance to Iranian Kurds and there is no significant difference between these two populations and other major ethnic groups of Iran. According to the scholar of historical geography, Xavier de Planhol: \\"Azeri material culture, a result of this multi-secular symbiosis, is thus a subtle combination of indigenous elements and nomadic contributions‚Ä¶. It is a Turkish language learned and spoken by Iranian peasants\\".De Planhol, X. (2005), \\"Lands of Iran\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. According to Richard Frye: \\"The Turkic speakers of Azerbaijan (q.v.) are descended from the earlier Iranian speakers, several pockets of whom still exist in the region.\\".R. N. Frye: Encyclop√¶dia Iranica , May 2, 2006 According to Olivier Roy: \\"The mass of the Oghuz Turkic tribes who crossed the Amu Darya towards the west left the Iranian plateau, which remained Persian, and established themselves more to the west, in Anatolia.

Tauris, 2007.Pg 7 According to Rybakov: \\"Speaking of the Azerbaijan culture originating at that time, in the XIV-XV cc., one must bear in mind, first of all, literature and other parts of culture organically connected with the language. As for the material culture, it remained traditional even after the Turkicization of the local population. However, the presence of a massive layer of Iranians that took part in the formation of the Azeri ethnos, have imposed its imprint, primarily on the lexicon of the Azeri language which contains a great number of Iranian and Arabic words. The latter entered both the Azeri and Turkish language mainly through the Iranian intermediary. Having become independent, the Azeri culture retained close connections with the Iranian and Arab cultures. They were reinforced by common religion and common cultural-historical traditions.\\".\\"\\"History of the East\\" (\\"Transcaucasia in 11th‚Äì15th centuries\\" in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes. v. 2. \\"East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. ‚Äì . )\\". Iranian Azeris have stronger genetic affinity with their immediate geographic neighbors than with populations from Central Asia. The Iranian origins of the Azeris likely derive from ancient Iranian tribes, such as the Medes in Iranian Azerbaijan, and Scythian invaders who arrived during the 8th century BCE. It is believed that the Medes mixed with an indigenous population, the Mannai, a group related to the Urartians.\\"Ancient Persia\\" , Encyclopedia Americana (retrieved 8 June 2006). Ancient written accounts, such as one written by Arab historian Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Masudi (896‚Äì956), attest to an Iranian presence in the region: Scholars see cultural similarities between modern Persians and Azeris as evidence of an ancient Iranian influence.\\"Azerbaijan\\" , Columbia Encyclopedia (retrieved 8 June 2006). Archaeological evidence indicates that the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism was prominent throughout the Caucasus before Christianity and Islam and that the influence of various Persian Empires added to the Iranian character of the area.\\"Various Fire-Temples\\" , University of Calgary (retrieved 8 June 2006). It has also been hypothesized that the population of Iranian Azerbaijan was predominantly Persian-speaking before the Oghuz arrived. This claim is supported by the many figures of Persian literature, such as Qatran Tabrizi, Shams Tabrizi, Nezami, and Khaghani, who wrote in Persian prior to and during the Oghuz migration, as well as by Strabo, Al-Istakhri, and Al-Masudi, who all describe the language of the region as Persian. The claim is mentioned by other medieval historians, such as Al-Muqaddasi.Al-Muqaddasi, Ahsan al- TaqƒÅsƒ´m, p. 259 & 378, \\"... the Azerbaijani language is not pretty [...] but their Persian is intelligible, and in articulation it is very similar to the Persian of Khorasan ...\\", tenth century, Persia (retrieved 18 June 2006). Other common Perso-Azeribaijani features include Iranian place names such as Tabriz\\"Tabriz\\" (retrieved 8 June 2006). and the name Azerbaijan itself. The modern presence of the Iranian Talysh and Tats in Azerbaijan is further evidence of the former Iranian character of the region.\\"Report for Talysh\\" , Ethnologue (retrieved 8 June 2006).\\"Report for Tats\\" , Ethnologue (retrieved 8 June 2006). As a precursor to these modern groups, the ancient Azaris are also hypothesized as ancestors of the modern Azeris. History =Background: Dividing of the Azerbaijanis by the Russian Empire= Following the Russo- Persian Wars of 1804‚Äì13 and 1826‚Äì28, the territories of the Iranian Qajar dynasty in the Caucasus were forcefully ceded to the Russian Empire and the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813 and the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828 finalized the borders between the Russian Empire and Qajar Iran. The areas to the north of the river Aras, including the territory of the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia over the course of the 19th century. The Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century settled the modern-day boundary of Iran, stripping it of all its Caucasian territories and incorporating them into the Russian Empire. The eventual formation of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918 established the territory of modern Azerbaijan. As a direct result of Qajar Iran's forced ceding to Russia, the Azerbaijanis are nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan.Swietochowski, Tadeusz. Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia 2003 Taylor and Francis, 2003. p 104 Despite living on two sides of an international border, the Azeris form a single ethnic group. =Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28)= The burden of the Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28) was on the tribes of Qaradaƒü region, who being in front line, provided human resources and provision of Iranian army. In the wake of the war a significant fraction of the inhabitants of this area lived as nomadic tribes (ÿß€åŸÑÿßÿ™). The major tribes included; Cilibyanlu 1,500 tents and houses, Karacurlu 2500, Haji Alilu 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500.R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, p. 313 At the time Ahar, with 3,500 inhabitants, was the only city of Qaradaƒü.Biblioth√®que orientale Elz√©virienne, Volume 52; Volume 55, 1887 p.224. The Haji-Alilu tribe played major rule in the later political developments. =Persian Constitutional Revolution of early twentieth century= During the Persian Constitutional Revolution Tabriz was at the center of battles which followed the ascent to throne of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar on 8 January 1907. The revolutionary forces were headed by Sattar Khan who was originally from Qaradaƒü.Ervand Abrahamian, Iran Between Two Revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982 p.97ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÖŸäÿ±ÿÆŸäÿ≤Ÿâÿå ŸÇŸäÿßŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ±ÿ®ÿßŸäÿ¨ÿßŸÜ Ÿà ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿ± ÿÆÿßŸÜÿå €±€π€∂€∞ÿå ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®ŸÅÿ±Ÿàÿ¥Ÿâ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ ÿØŸàÿ≥ÿ™Ÿâÿå \\"ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿ≥Ÿá Ÿáÿß Ÿà ÿ≠ŸÖÿßÿ≥Ÿá ÿ≥ÿßÿ≤ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÜŸÇŸÑÿßÿ® ŸÖÿ¥ÿ±Ÿàÿ∑Ÿäÿ™: ÿ®ÿß ÿ™ÿßÿ°⁄©€åÿØ ÿ®ÿ± ŸÜŸÇÿ¥ ŸÖÿ±ÿØŸÖ ÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜ (ŸÇÿ±Ÿá ÿØÿßÿ∫)\\"ÿå ÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå €≤€∞€∞€∂ Haydar Khan Amo-oghli had significant contribution in the inception and progression of the revolution, and introducing leftist ideas into Iranian mainstream politics.IsmƒÅ ªƒ´l RƒÅ'ƒ´n, \\"·∏§aydar KhƒÅn ƒÄm≈´ π≈´ghlƒ´\\", IntishƒÅrƒÅt-i Mu ºassasah-i Ta·∏•qiq-i RƒÅ ºƒ´n, Tehran During the following tumultuous years, Amir Arshad, the headman of Haji-Alilu tribe, had major impact on the subsequent political developments in Iran in relation to the status of Iranian Kurds.

The ill- fated Constitutional Revolution did not bring democracy to Iran. Instead, RezƒÅ ShƒÅh, then Brigadier-General of the Persian Cossack Brigade, deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last Shah of the Qajar dynasty, and founded the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925 and established a despotic monarchy.Abrahamian, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p.91Roger Homan, \\"The Origins of the Iranian Revolution ,\\" International Affairs 56/4 (Autumn 1980): 673‚Äì7. His insistence on ethnic nationalism and cultural unitarism along with forced detribalization and sedentarization resulted in suppression of several ethnic and social groups, including Azerbaijanis. Ironically, the main architect of this totalitarian policy, which was justified by reference to racial ultra-nationalism, was Mirza Fatali Akhundov, an intellectual from Azerbaijan.Cottam, Richard W. (1979). Nationalism in Iran. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press. p 18.Bayat, Mangol (1991). Iran‚Äôs First Revolution: Shi‚Äôism and the Constitutional Revolution of 1905‚Äì1909.

In accordance with the Orientalist views of the supremacy of the Aryan peoples, he idealized pre-Islamic Achaemenid and Sassanid empires, whilst negating the 'Islamization' of Persia by Muslim forces.\\". This idealization of a distant past was put into practice by both the Pahlavi kings, particularly Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who honored himself with the title ƒÄryƒÅmehr, Light of the Aryans.. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in an interview concisely expressed his views by declaring, \\"we Iranians are Aryans, and the fact that we are not adjacent to other Aryan nations in Europe is just a geographical anomaly.\\". Mirza Fatali Akhundov is not the only Azeri intellectual in framing Iranian ultra-nationalism. Hassan Taqizadeh, the organizer of \\"Iran Society\\" in Berlin, has contributed to the development of Iranian nationalism. Since 1916 he published \\"Kaveh\\" periodical in Farsi language, which included articles emphasizing the racial unity of Germans and Iranians.ÿ®ŸáŸÜÿßŸÖÿå ÿ¨ŸÖÿ¥€åÿØ (1386). ÿ®ÿ±ŸÑŸÜ€å Ÿáÿß: ÿßŸÜÿØ€åÿ¥ŸÖŸÜÿØÿßŸÜ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å ÿØÿ± ÿ®ÿ±ŸÑŸÜ 1915‚Äì1930.

The idea of a greater homeland for all Turks was propagated by pan-Turkism, which was adopted almost at once as a main ideological pillar by the Committee of Union and Progress and somewhat later by other political caucuses in what remained of the Ottoman Empire. On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkist propaganda focused chiefly on the Turkic-speaking peoples of the southern Caucasus, in Iranian Azerbaijan and Turkistan in Central Asia, with the ultimate purpose of persuading them all to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was this latter appeal to Iranian Azeris which, contrary to pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azeri intellectuals to become the most vociferous advocates of Iran's territorial integrity and sovereignty. If in Europe \\"romantic nationalism responded to the damage likely to be caused by modernism by providing a new and larger sense of belonging, an all- encompassing totality, which brought about new social ties, identity and meaning, and a new sense of history from one's origin on to an illustrious future,\\"(42) in Iran after the Constitutional movement romantic nationalism was adopted by the Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the irredentist policies threatening the country's territorial integrity. In their view, assuring territorial integrity was a necessary first step on the road to establishing the rule of law in society and a competent modern state which would safeguard collective as well as individual rights. It was within this context that their political loyalty outweighed their other ethnic or regional affinities. The failure of the Democrats in the arena of Iranian politics after the Constitutional movement and the start of modern state-building paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group's cultural nationalism. Whereas the adoption of integrationist policies preserved Iran's geographic integrity and provided the majority of Iranians with a secure and firm national identity, the blatant ignoring of other demands of the Constitutional movement, such as the call for formation of society based on law and order, left the country still searching for a political identity. The ultimate purpose was to persuade these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and join the new pan-Turkic homeland.Touraj Atabaki, \\"Recasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan-Turkism and Iranian Nationalism\\" in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor). Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London, GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001. Actual Quote: It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azeris, which, contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azeri intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies threatening Iran's territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azeris. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and a modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoption of these integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group's cultural nationalism. =World War II and Soviet intervention= In late 1941 Soviet forces invaded Iran in coordination with British Army under an operation known as Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. Their forces broke through the border and moved from the Azerbaijan SSR into Iranian Azerbaijan. Reza Shah was forced by the invading British to abdicate in favor of his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who replaced his father as Shah on the throne on 16 September 1941. At the aftermath of a four-year-long tumultuous period the Azerbaijan People's Government, a Soviet puppet state, was established in Tabriz, perhaps through direct involvement of the Soviet leadership.Cold War International History Project-Collection- 1945‚Äì46 Iranian Crisis. http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&fuseaction;=va2.browse&sort;=Collection&item;=1945%2D46%20Iranian%20Crisis This government autonomously ruled the province from November 1945 to November 1946.Thomas De Waal, \\"The Caucasus: an introduction\\", Oxford University Press US, 2010. pp 87: \\"Soviet troops moved into Iranian, and a shored lived \\"Azerbaijan People's Government in Iran,\\" led by the Iranian Azeri Communist Ja'far Pishevari, was set up in Tabriz in 1945‚Äì46. But the Soviet-backed puppet state collapsed in 1946 after Soviet forces withdrew, again under Western pressure. However, the Soviet soon realized their idea was premature, the mass of population did not support separatism;\\"As it turned out, the Soviets had to recognize that their ideas on Iran were premature. The issue of Iranian Azerbaijan became one of the opening skirmishes of the Cold War, and, largely under the Western powers' pressure, Soviet forces withdrew in 1946. The autonomous republic collapsed soon afterward, and the members of the Democratic Party took refuge in the Soviet Union, fleeing Iranian revenge.. In Tabriz, the crowds that had just recently applauded the autonomous republic were now greeting the returning Iranian troops, and Azeri students publicly burned their native-language textbooks. The mass of the population was obviously not ready even for a regional self-government so long as it smacked of separatism\\". (Swietochowski, Tadeusz 1989. \\"Islam and the Growth of National Identity in Soviet Azerbaijan\\", Kappeler, Andreas, Gerhard Simon, Georg Brunner eds. Muslim Communities Reemerge: Historical Perspective on Nationality, Politics, and Opposition in the Former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Durham: Duke University Press, pp. 46‚Äì60.) under largely Western pressure, the Soviet troops withdrew in 1946, which resulted in the quick collapse of the Azerbaijan People's Government. =Iranian Azeri migration to Azerbaijan= Beginning in the 1850s, many Iranian Azeris opted to become work migrants and seek job opportunities in the Russian Empire, primarily in the economically booming Azeri-populated part of the Caucasus. Due to them being Persian subjects, Russian offices often recorded them as \\"Persians\\". The migrants referred to one another as hamshahri (\\"compatriot\\") as an in-group identity.

Within the Islamic Revolutionary government there emerged an Azeri nationalist faction led by Ayatollah Kazem Shariatmadari, who advocated greater regional autonomy and wanted the constitution to be revised to include secularists and opposition parties; this was denied.\\"Shi'ite Leadership: In the Shadow of Conflicting Ideologies\\", by David Menashri, Iranian Studies, 13:1‚Äì4 (1980) (retrieved 10 June 2006).

More recently, the Azerbaijani language and culture is being taught and studied at university level in Iran, and there appears to exist publications of books, newspapers and apparently, regional radio broadcasts too in the language.Annika Rabo, Bo Utas, \\"The role of the state in West Asia\\", Swedish Research institute in Istanbul, 2005. pg 156.

Currently, the living conditions of Azeris in Iran closely resemble that of Persians: Azeris in Iran are in high positions of authority with the Azeris Ayatollah Ali Khamenei currently sitting as the Supreme Leader. Azeris in Iran remain quite conservative in comparison to most Azeris in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, since the Republic of Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, there has been renewed interest and contact between Azeris on both sides of the border. Andrew Burke writes: According to Bulent Gokay: Richard Thomas, Roger East, and Alan John Day state: According to Michael P. Croissant: Iranian Azerbaijan has seen some anti-government protests by Iranian Azerbaijanis in recent years, most notably in 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2015 While Iranian Azeris may seek greater linguistic rights, few of them display separatist tendencies. Extensive reporting by Afshin Molavi, an Iranian Azeri scholar, in the three major Azeri provinces of Iran, as well as among Iranian Azeris in Tehran, found that separatist sentiment was not widely held among Iranian Azeris . Few people framed their genuine political, social and economic frustration ‚Äì feelings that are shared by the majority of Iranians ‚Äì within an ethnic context. According to another Iranian Azeri scholar Dr. Hassan Javadi ‚Äì a Tabriz-born, Cambridge-educated scholar of Azerbaijani literature and professor of Persian, Azeri and English literature at George Washington University ‚Äì Iranian Azeris have more important matters on their mind than cultural rights. \\"Iran's Azeri community, like the rest of the country, is engaged in the movement for reform and democracy,\\" Javadi told the Central Asia Caucasus Institute crowd, adding that separatist groups represent \\"fringe thinking.\\" He also told EurasiaNet: \\"I get no sense that these cultural issues outweigh national ones, nor do I have any sense that there is widespread talk of secession.\\" Culture Iranian Azeris, a Turkic speaking people, are culturally apart of the Iranian peoples and have influenced Iranian culture.\\"Azerbaijan\\" Archived 17 May 2006 at the Wayback Machine ‚Äì Columbia Encyclopedia(retrieved 8 June 2006). At the same time, they have influenced and been influenced by their non-Iranian neighbors, especially Caucasians and Russians. Azeri music is distinct music that is tightly connected to the music of other Iranian peoples such as Persian music and Kurdish music, and also the music of the Caucasian peoples. Although the Azerbaijani language is not an official language of Iran it is widely used, mostly orally, among the Iranian Azeris. =Literature= Jahan Shah (r. 1438‚Äì67), the Qara Qoyunlu (\\"black sheep\\") ruler of Azerbaijan was a master poet. He compiled a diwan under the pen-name Haqiqi. Shah Isma'il (1487‚Äì1524), who used the pen-name Khata'i, was a prominent ruler-poet and has, apart from his diwan compiled a mathnawi called Deh-name, consisting of some eulogies of Ali, the fourth Caliph of early Islam.Ekmeleddin ƒ∞hsanoƒülu (Editor), Culture and Learning in Islam, 2003, p. 282 After the Safavid era, Azeri could not sustain its early development. The main theme of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was the development of verse-folk stories, mainly intended for performance by Ashughs in weddings. The most famous among these literary works are Koroghlu,John Renard, Islam and the Heroic Image: Themes in Literature and the Visual Arts, 1999, Mercer University Press, p. 50. Ashiq Q…ôrib, and K…ôr…ôm il…ô ∆èsli. Following the establishing of Qajar dynasty in Iran Azerbaijani literature flourished and reached its peak by the end of the nineteenth century. By then, journalism had been launched in Azerbaijani language and social activism had become the main theme of literary works. The most influential writers of this era are Fathali AkhondzadehFeraydoon Adamyat, Andishe-ha-ye Mirza Fathali Akhondzadeh (The Thoughts of Mirza Fathali Akhondzadeh) (Tehran: Kharazmi Publications, 1970 and Mojez Shabestari. Pahlavi era was the darkest period for Azerbaijani literature. The education and publication in Azerbaijani language was banned and writers of Azerbaijan, such as Gholam-Hossein Saedi, Samad Behrangi and Reza Barahani, published their works in Farsi language. The only exception was Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar, who is famous for his verse book, Heydar Babaya Salam; simply he was too mighty to be censored. Shahriar's work was an innovative way of summarizing the Cultural identity in concise poetic form and was adapted by a generation of lesser known poets, particularly from Qareh Dagh region, to record their oral traditions. One remarkable example is Abbas Eslami, known with his pen-name Barez, (1932‚Äì2011) who described the melancholic demise of his homeland in a book titled mourning Sabalan. Another example is Mohamad Golmohamadi's long poem, titled I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh (ŸÇÿßÿ±ÿßÿØÿßÿ∫ ÿßÿ§ŸÑ⁄©Ÿá‚Äåÿ≥€åŸÜ€åŸÜ ⁄Øÿ§ÿ± ŸÜÿ¶ÿ¨Ÿá ÿØ€åŸàÿßŸÜŸá‚Äåÿ≥€å ÿßŸÖ), is a concise description of the region's cultural landscape. The long lasting suppression finally led to a generation of revolutionary poets, composing verses by allegoric allusion to imposing landscape of Azerbaijan: > Sahand, o mountain of pure snow, Descended from Heaven with Zoroaster Fire > in your heart, snow on your shoulders, with storm of centuries, And white > hair of history on your chest ... Yadollah Maftun Amini (born in 1926)Gholam-Reza Sabri-Tabrizi, Iran: A Child's Story, a Man's Experience, 1989, Mainstream Publishing Company, p. 168 After the Islamic revolution of 1979 the ban on Azeri publications in Iran has eased. However, great literary works have not yet appeared and glory days of fifteenth century ruler-poets is not on the horizon. The contemporary literature is restricted to oral traditions, such as bayaties. Music An Ashugh performance The traditional Azeri music can be classified into two categories: the music of \\"ashugh\\" and the \\"mugham\\". Mugham, despite its similarity to Persian classic music and utmost importance in Azerbaijan, has not been popular among Iranian Azeris. The ashugh music had survived in mountainous region of Qaradaƒü and presently is identified as the representative of the cultural identity of Azeris. Recent innovative developments, aiming to enhance the urban-appealing aspects of this ashugh performances, has drastically enhanced the status of ashugh music. The opening of academic style music classes in Tabriz by master ashughs, such as Ashig Imran Heidari and Ashig Changiz Mehdipour, has greatly contributed to the ongoing image building. =Art= Living in cross-road of many civilizations, Azeris artisans have developed a rich tradition of decorative arts including rugs, lace, printed textiles, jewelry, vessels made of copper, engraved metals, wooden articles and ceramics. Among these, carpet weaving stands out as the acme of Azeri art. Carpet weaving Tabriz is one of the main centers of carpet weaving in Iran. At present 40% of Iranian carpet exports are originated from Tabriz.Tabriz rug These carpets are generally known as Tabriz rugs. Another carpet weaving center is Ardebil, which, despite being overshadowed by Tabriz in recent years, has produced the finest carpets in past. Two most famous Iranian rugs in the world had been woven in Ardebil in 1540. One is hung in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the other is in the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts. These carpets have silk warps and contain over thirty million knots.Rami Yelda, A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited, authourHOUSE, 2012 The acme of carpet weaving art is manifested in Verni,K K Goswam, Advances in Carpet Manufacture, 2008, Woodhead Publishing in Textiles, p. 148 which was originated in Nagorno-Karabakh. Verni is a carpet- like kilim with a delicate and fine warp and woof, which is woven without a previous sketch, thanks to the creative talents of nomadic women and girls. Verni weavers employ the image of birds and animals (deer, rooster, cat, snake, birds, gazelle, sheep, camel, wolf and eagle) in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the earthenware patterns that were popular in prehistoric times. A key d√©cor feature, which is intrinsic to many Vernis, is the S-element. Its shape varies, it may resemble both figure 5 and letter S. This element means \\"dragon\\" among the nomads. At present, Verni is woven by the girls of Arasbaran Tribes, often in the same room where the nomadic tribes reside, and is a significant income source for about 20000 families in Qaradagh region. Verni weavers employ the image of birds and animals in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the earthenware patterns that were popular in prehistoric times.

Azeris commemorate Shia holy days (ten first days of the holy month of Muharram) at least with the same intensity as other Iranians. In metropolitan cities with mixed ethnic composition, such as Tehran, Azeris are thought to be more intense in their expression of religious ritual than their Persian counterparts.R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, vol. I, p. 80 However, Azeris are less inclined to Islamism. This is evident by the fact that just before revolution Azeris followed either Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari or Kho'i, both traditionalist jurists. In contrast, Persians followed more radical Ruhollah Khomeini. There is also a small minority of Azeris who practice the Bah√°'√≠ Faith. Also in recent years, some Azeris in Iran have begun converting to Christianity, which is strictly prohibited and can result in imprisonment. Followers of Yarisan religion (Goran in the Azeri language) constitute a significant fraction of the population. In some regions Yarisan followers are sometimes known as Shamlus, a clear reference to the name of Shamlu tribe, which was one of the main constituents of Qizilbash confederation.

He was also a master mechanic. Biography Bonk began his career at BSG Motor Nema Netzschkau as a track and field athlete and set the East German youth record for the shot put in 1967 with 17.82 m. To build up the necessary strength for shot putting, he regularly lifted weights. After participating in weightlifting contests and having greater successes in it than in shot putting, he shifted his focus completely towards weightlifting in 1969 at SC Karl-Marx-Stadt, Chemnitz. His coach was Klaus Kroll, a former top weightlifter of the GDR. In 1971 Bonk became GDR super heavyweight champion (with a bodyweight above 110 kg). During the Baltic-Cup, in L√ºbeck in the same year, he had his international debut, where he made three failed pressing attempts. Being a top lifter, he was never able to beat Vasiliy Alekseyev from the Soviet Union or Rudolf Mang from Germany up to 1980. His specialty was the clean and jerk, where he set two world records. In 1980 he once more placed third at the European Championships and even lifted 430 kg (180‚Äì250) in a smaller competition. Because he was not nominated for the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, he stepped back from professional weightlifting. Bonk lived in Limbach/Vogtland as a pensioner.

Abstract. Biography Patinkin was born January 8, 1922, in Chicago, to a family of Jewish emigrants from Poland. While doing his undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, he also studied the Talmud at the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago. He continued at Chicago for his graduate studies, earning a Ph.D. in 1947 under the supervision of Oskar R. Lange. Patinkin was a strong Zionist and, while doing his graduate studies, already planned to emigrate to Palestine; in his graduate research he studied Palestinian economics, with a view to making his emigration case stronger, although he did not complete his thesis in this subject. After graduating he held lecturer positions at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois until he succeeded in emigrating to Israel in 1949, where he was hired by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1956 he was appointed the research director of the Falk Institute for Economic Research, which was established by Simon Kuznetz with the support of the Falk Foundation.Krampf, A. 2010. 'Economic Planning of the Free Market in Israel during the First Decade: The Influence of Don Patinkin on Israeli Policy Discourse', Science in Context 23(4): 507‚Äì534. He remained at the Hebrew University for the rest of his career and was the university president from 1982 to 1986, following Avraham Harman, but resigned due to the poor state of the university's finances and was succeeded by Amnon Pazy. He retired in 1989, and died August 7, 1995 in Jerusalem. Research Patinkin's work explored some of the microfoundations of Keynesian macroeconomics, particularly the role of money demand. His monograph Money, Interest, and Prices (1956) was for many years one of the most widely used advanced references on monetary economics. Huw Dixon believes that:Dixon H, Surfing Economics, Chapter 3 \\"Money, Interest and Prices is perhaps as great in its vision as Keynes‚Äô General Theory. Whilst the latter has a greater abundance of originality, the former has a greater clarity of insight and formal expression. Don Patinkin states his theory of the labour market and corresponding notion of the full employment equilibrium in just three pages of Money, Interest and Prices (in the 1965 edn. pp. 127‚Äì30). These pages deserve great attention: they state the labour market model that became the standard foundation for the aggregate supply curve in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model. Although Patinkin himself did not formulate the AD/AS representation, it is implicit in his Money, Interest and Prices.\\" Publications * \\"Mercantilism and the Readmission of Jews in England\\", 1946, Jewish Social Studies * \\"Multiple-Plant Firms, Cartels and Imperfect Competition\\", 1947, QJE. * \\"Relative Prices, Say's Law, and the Demand for Money\\", 1948, Econometrica. * \\"Price Flexibility and Full Employment\\", 1948, AER. * \\"The Indeterminacy of Absolute Prices in Classical Economic Theory\\", 1949, Econometrica. * \\"Involuntary Unemployment and the Keynesian Supply Function\\", 1949, EJ. * \\"A Reconsideration of the General Equilibrium Theory of Money\\", 1950, RES. * \\"The Invalidity of Classical Monetary Theory\\", 1951, Econometrica. * \\"Further Considerations of the General Equilibrium Theory of Money\\", 1951, RES. * \\"The Limitations of Samuelson's \`Correspondence Principle'\\", 1952, Metroeconomica. * \\"Wicksell's \`Cumulative Process'\\", 1952, EJ. * \\"Dichotomies of the Pricing Process in Economic Theory\\", 1954, Economica. * \\"Keynesian Economics and the Quantity Theory\\", 1954, in Kurihara, editor, Post-Keynesian Economics. * \\"Monetary and Price Developments in Israel\\", 1955, Scripta Hierosolymitana. * \\"Money, Interest and Prices: An integration of monetary and value theory\\", 1956. * \\"Liquidity Preference and Loanable Funds: Stock and flow analysis\\", 1958, Economica. * \\"Secular Price Movements and Economic Development: Some theoretical aspects\\", in Bonne, editor, The Challenge of Development. * \\"The Israel Economy: The first decade\\", 1959. * \\"Keynes and Econometrics: On the Interaction of the Macroeconomic Revolutions of the Interwar Period\\", 1976, Econometrica.

In the \\"2000s\\", The Xylouris Ensemble expanded to include a younger generation of players, including Psarogiorgis' sons Nikos and Adonis Xylouris, who are based in Melbourne. Xylouris plays the laouto as a solo instrument, in contrast to the traditional accompaniment role the laouto has in Cretan music. Normally in an ensemble, the laouto provides the rhythmic backing to the lyra, which is par excellence a singer‚Äôs instrument. In this role, Giorgos is peerless.

Tert√∂ns may reveal them from terma at specific and appropriate times. Their locations were kept on scrolls (lamyig or neyig) hidden under rocks and inside caves, monasteries and stupas. They are places where physical and spiritual worlds overlap and Tantric practice effectiveness increases with multiple perception dimensions. Padmasambhava assigned deities to protect the beyul. Protective forces manifest as snowstorms, mists and snow leopards. Buddhist texts indicate beyul are discovered when the planet is approaching destruction and the world becomes too corrupt for spiritual practice. They describe valleys reminiscent of paradise, which can only be reached with enormous hardship. Pilgrims who travel to these wild and distant places often recount extraordinary experiences similar to those encountered by Buddhist spiritual practitioners on the path to liberation. People who try to force their way in may encounter failure and death. Earthly beyuls share significant characteristics with Shambhala. A recent attempt to open a beyul occurred in 1962, when the Tibetan lama Tulshuk Lingpa journeyed to Sikkim in order to 'open' Beyul Demoshong, a beyul fabled to exist on the slopes of Mount Kanchenjunga straddling the Nepal/Sikkim border. He took with him over 300 followers from across the Himalayas and Tibet, each of whom had given away his or her worldly goods. Their story is told in the recent book, A Step Away from Paradise. Nghe-Beyul at Barun Valley. Beyul are often understood to embody dharmapala and lords of the land, which are associated with the geographic features such as mountain, trees, rocks and water sources. Pilgrims make ritual offerings to these beings to appease their wrathful nature, and to renew the symbolic unity that people share with them. It has been argued that this attitude indicates a sustainable approach toward land stewardship. In Nepal and Tibet around Mount Everest are the Khenbalung, Solukhumbu, Rolwaling, Rongshar, Kyirong and Nubri sacred valleys.Reinhard, Johan (1978) Khembalung: The Hidden Valley. Kailash, A Journal of Himalayan Studies 6(1): 5-35, Kathmandu. The Sherpa people discovered Solukhumbu when they left Tibet to escape religious persecution in the 15th and 16th centuries. They entered the valley to seek refuge and made a new homeland there. Buddhist monasteries and sacred mountains have brought many spiritual travelers to Solukhumbu. Beyul are found in the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan, India, China and Pakistan.

His most successful work, Ratman's Notebooks, sold over a million copies.Belfast's man they couldn't kill and the Michael Jackson hit record Early life Stephen Gilbert was born in Newcastle, Co Down, in 1912, into a prosperous Irish Protestant mercantile family, and grew up mainly in an affluent district of East Belfast. Like his near contemporaries CS Lewis and Louis MacNeice, the young Gilbert was sent \\"across the water\\" to school. From age ten he attended The Leas, Hoylake on Merseyside, and from age 13 Loretto School, Musselburgh from which he returned without a leaving certificate. In Belfast he worked briefly as a court reporter for the Northern Whig (a witness to magistrates imposing fines on failed suicides, Gilbert in later years volunteered with the Samaritans). From the mid-1930's he was working full time in his father's tea and seed business. Preface to Friendship with Forrest Reid In 1931, just before his 19th birthday, Gilbert met the novelist Forrest Reid then in his mid fifties. Reid's many novels reflect his fascination with teenage boys, and he was drawn to Gilbert. The two commenced a turbulent friendship that lasted until Reid's death in 1947. Reid acted as a mentor to Gilbert, and depicts an idealised version of their relationship (opening with a holiday encounter in the seaside town of Ballycastle) in his novel Brian Westby (1944). The relationship appeared platonic, but Gilbert found Reid's demands, and interference in his affairs, excessive. Gilbert's later novel, Barnaby Experiments (1952), appearing five years after Reid's death, has been read as \\"a thinly disguised portrayal of their relationship from Gilbert's point of view and a belated response to Brian Westby\\".Preface to Novels Gilbert's first novel, The Landslide (1943), a fantasy involving prehistoric creatures uncovered in a landslide in a remote part of Ireland was dedicated to Reid. A second novel, Bombardier, appeared the following years. It is based on his wartime experiences with the 3rd (Ulster) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery in France, including the evacuation at Dunkirk. Later work again involved fantastical plot twists. The last novel Gilbert published, Ratman's Notebooks(1968), is the story of a loner who learns he can train rats to kill. It proved to be his most famous, twice being filmed in the United States as Wlllard. The first adaptation, directed by Daniel Mann, was released in 1971, and was followed in 1972 by an original sequel called Ben. The original film was remade in 2003 directed by Glenn Morgan. The Bloody City In 2015, Valancourt Books, an independent American publishing house dedicated to \\"the rediscovery of rare, neglected, and out-of- print fiction,\\" published a limited edition of an unfinished novel of Stephen Gilbert's. Edited and compiled by the playwright and comedian Andrew Doyle, it draws on manuscripts in the possession of the author's son, Tom Gilbert, and of Queen's University, Belfast. The Bloody City is a realist novel, that takes the reader through the first year of the Northern Ireland Troubles: it begins in the final months of 1968 as the Northern Ireland civil rights movement takes to the streets and ends after the 1969 August riots. The protagonist is to a degree autobiographical. Like Gilbert, \\"Frank Downton\\" is a son attempting to work with his father in a family business that, in many respects, is a stolid representation of city's dissolving Victorian and Unionist order. Downton is caught up in the street violence and in the sectarian, class and sexual tensions of the workplace.

Early years Born on 4 December 1879 in London, Maclagan was the only son of William Dalrymple Maclagan, Archbishop of York and his second wife Augusta Anne, daughter of the sixth Lord Barrington. He had a sister and two half- brothers. Educated at Winchester College, he read classics at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1902. Career In 1905 Maclagan joined the staff at the Victoria and Albert Museum as an assistant in the Textiles Department. During his time there he produced a Guide to English Ecclesiastical Embroideries. After a time he transferred to the Department of Architecture and Sculpture where he worked under Mr A B Skinner. He became head of this department when Skinner died in 1908. One of his first tasks was to rearrange the collection of Italian sculpture and start the large Catalogue of Italian Plaquettes, which was published many years later in 1924. =France= In 1916 Maclagan was temporarily transferred to the Foreign Office, and later to the Ministry of Information. He became head of the Ministry's bureau in Paris and its controller for France in 1918. In 1919 he was attached to the British peace delegation and was present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. For his services in France, Maclagan was made a CBE in 1919. While in Paris, he was a member of the \\"set\\" surrounding the novelist Edith Wharton.Edith Wharton and the Faubourg Saint-Germain: the diary of the Abbe Mugnier|Twentieth Century Literature =Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum= After his time in France, Maclagan returned to the Victoria and Albert Museum; and on the retirement of Sir Cecil Harcourt Smith in 1924 was appointed Director and Secretary. During his twenty one years in office the museum increased its reputation as a centre for research and learning. He produced the Catalogue of Italian Sculpture in collaboration with Margaret Longhurst, an assistant keeper in the Sculpture Department. As Director he also worked towards broadening the museum's public appeal, for example by selling picture post-cards and Christmas cards of objects, issuing a series of sixpenny picture books (including his own, Children in Sculpture and Portrait Busts), and organising free public lectures. He introduced the \\"Object of the Week\\" scheme, under which a different object from the museum's collection, with a descriptive label, was placed in the entrance hall every Monday. He also wanted to rearrange the displays according to primary and secondary collections, but this proved impossible in the financial climate of the 1930s, and was not realised until Sir Leigh Aston reassembled the collections in 1945. While at the museum, Maclagan wrote many scholarly articles and catalogues; and also an essay on The Bayeux Tapestry, published (as a King Penguin) in 1943, which became a minor bestseller. During his time as Director he was personally responsible for a number of important public exhibitions. Among the most outstanding were the exhibitions of the works of art belonging to the livery companies of the City of London (1926), of English Medieval Art (1930), the William Morris Centenary exhibition (1934), the exhibition of the Eumorfopoulos collection (1936), and an exhibition of sculptures which had been moved from Westminster Abbey during the Second World War (1945). =Other Offices= Maclagan was knighted in 1933, and in 1945 he was appointed KCVO. He held important appointments both at home and abroad. In 1927‚Äì8 he was Charles Eliot Norton professor at Harvard University. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, acting as vice-president from 1932 to 1936, president of the Museums Association from 1935‚Äì36, and chairman of the National Buildings Record. He was also appointed to lectureships at Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin and Hull and was given honorary degrees at Birmingham and Oxford. As chairman for the fine arts committee of the British Council from 1941, Maclagan organised many exhibitions sent abroad by the council after the war. He was a gifted lecturer, proficient in French and German. Maclagan was a keen churchman and took a prominent part in the affairs of the Anglo-Catholic movement. He performed much public service on behalf of the church through the Cathedrals Advisory Council and the Central Council for the Care of Churches, which for some time was housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Other Interests Despite being a specialist in the field of early Christian and Italian Renaissance art, Maclagan also admired many modern artists. In his personal collection he had a bust of himself made by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá and was one of the first private collectors to buy the work of Henry Moore, he also unveiled the painting of the crucifixion by Graham Sutherland in St Matthew's Church, Northampton. Maclagan had a profound interest in literature and poetry. He made several translations of the works of French poets, especially Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Val√©ry and published a volume of poems, Leaves in the Road in 1901 whilst an undergraduate. He designed several bookplates including one for his friend Bernard Berenson. Personal life In 1913 Maclagan married Helen Elizabeth, daughter of the Commander the Hon. Frederick Lascelles, second son of the 4th Earl of Harewood. They had two sons: the elder, Michael became a distinguished historian, antiquary and herald; the younger, Gerald, was killed in action serving with the Rhodesian Air Force in 1942. Maclagan died on 14 September 1951 while travelling in Spain.

Personal life  Franklin Pitcher Johnson Jr. was born in 1928 in Quincy, Illinois and is the son of Franklin Pitcher \\"Pitch\\" Johnson, an Olympic track and field athlete and college coach. When he was 12 years old his family moved to Palo Alto, California. He studied at the Palo Alto High School where he ran on a track team. According to Johnson Jr., he was not as good at running as his father. Despite that, according to him, he has learned a lot of things from his father, \\"My dad taught me to shake hands with my opponents after the race, win or lose.\\" Johnson Jr. studied mechanical engineering at Stanford University (1946‚Äì50). After attending Harvard Business School (1950‚Äì52) he joined the US Air Force (1952‚Äì54) as an aircraft maintenance officer and worked in the Inland Steel Company's Indiana Harbor Works. He has a wife Catherine, three sons, and one daughter. He describes himself as an Episcopalian and a Republican.  Career  = Venture capitalist = The US Congress passed a law in 1958 to foment the creation of venture capital under which the government would lend private capital. Johnson and his friend, Bill Draper, decided to co-found a venture capital company in Palo Alto. With a combination of savings and family loans, they formed Draper and Johnson Investment Company (D+J) in 1962. Johnson then took courses at Stanford at age 35 to study molecular biology and computer science. These studies were later useful for his investments in biotechnology and informatics. According to him, being \\"a local guy\\" has helped him since he knew many local entrepreneurs, lawyers, and other professionals and was easier for him to \\"check out\\" potential business partners. In 1965 he founded a venture capital company, Asset Management Company, which is still in operation. Apart of that, he has also helped found other companies including Amgen, Biogen Idec and Tandem. He said that as a rough estimate, of every 10 companies that he helped find, one would return 20 or more times the investment, 3 or 4 doubled it, and the rest didn't lose nor win money, and they had to be sold, sometimes with losses and sometimes ending even. = Business leader and educator = He was director of the National Venture Capital Association and of the Western Association of Venture Capitalists, and also a trustee of the Foothill‚ÄìDe Anza Community College District for 12 years. He taught a class in entrepreneurship and venture capital for 12 years at Stanford Business School, and he remained active in the faculty through 2009. Currently, he works as a lecturer in Management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Since 1990, Johnson Jr. has been an advisor to various eastern European countries. Collaborating alongside the Amro Bank of the Netherlands, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and Polish, Czech and Slovak entrepreneurs and venture managers he has aided to form a venture investment company called European Renaissance Capital. Its goal is to invest and to invest in and help new companies in Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia. Additionally, he has been involved in the creating of a buy-out fund in Romania and venture capital funds in Russia, Norway, and New Zealand.

The collaboration project was official announced in June 2010, under the name of Satellite, with band members including McMorran, Allan, Dunahoo and drummer Justin Glasco, who later left the band as a sought after producer. In 2011, Erik Kertes joined the band as the new bassist to allow McMorran to switch to guitar. The band released its first EP Ring the Bells on July 24, 2010. The EP being a mix of mellow alternative rock and power pop, with influences such as Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Radiohead, and Snow Patrol. The EP has been critically acclaimed by Radar Online, Alternative Press, Kings of A&R;, and The LA Examiner. The band supported the release of the EP with a music video for the first single \\"Say the Words\\" and some dates performing live around the Los Angeles area, with their first date as a full band being on August 14, 2010, at the Saint Rocke in Hermosa Beach. Satellite recently completed its forthcoming debut album, Calling-Birds, set to be released February 2013 on Descendant Records/Sony Music Entertainment. Frontman Steven McMorran has a creative history of collaborating with everyone from Weezer's Rivers Cuomo to Joe Cocker and Every Avenue. McMorran recently collaborated with Cuomo on his English-Japanese self-titled LP called, Scott & Rivers. McMorran co-wrote the first track, \\"Break Free\\", stating, \\"The best part about that experience was seeing how he built this story that we sort of outlined together... and I got to hear the word 'perambulations' fit perfectly into a verse.\\" Band members {- style=\\"vertical-align:top\\" |Steven McMorran of Satellite playing at WBJB Summer Concert Series on the Beach at Belmar, NJ on August 15, 2013. |Satellite playing at WBJB Summer Concert Series on the Beach at Belmar, NJ on August 15, 2013. |Satellite playing at WBJB Summer Concert Series on the Beach at Belmar, NJ on August 15, 2013. |} *Steven McMorran - lead vocals, guitar (2010‚Äìpresent) Press * CBS Last.FM Live @ Rockwood Hall ‚Äì Teaser for ‚ÄúBrooklyn‚Äù: http://originals.last.fm/live-in-nyc/satellite-sneak-peek-brooklyn/ * MSN VIDEO ‚Äî Bing Lounge Performance for Kink Radio Portland ** I‚Äôm On Fire: http://video.us.msn.com/watch/video/satellite-i-m-on-fire/1l3ck0e6a ** Brooklyn: http://video.us.msn.com/watch/video/satellite-brooklyn/1l3fvcwjw?cpkey=531e37da-cfc1-4859-82c0-7eaa905ec9c1%257c%257c%257c%257c ** Interview: http://video.us.msn.com/watch/video/satellite-live-interview-on-kink-fm/1l3087hsl?cpkey=531e37da-cfc1-4859-82c0-7eaa905ec9c1%257c%257c%257c%257c * ARTISTdirect - ‚ÄúTurning On My Own‚Äù video premiere ** http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/video-premiere-satellite-turning-on-my-own/10565350 * Liner Notes Series, Metrolyrics ** http://www.metrolyrics.com/blog/2013/06/06/satellites-steven-mcmorran-reveals-songwriting-inspiration/ * NME Magazine - ‚ÄúTurning On My Own‚Äù video placement ** https://www.nme.com/musicvideos/satellite-turning-on-my-own/1895345 Press Quotes: * \\"Lead singer and chief songwriter Steven McMorran is a modern-day pop music philosopher.- CBS/last.fm * \\"Calling Birds, an album that can best be described as an indie-inspired slice of Americana\\" -Huffington Post, A-Side Series * \\"Satellite's Steven McMorran eases between cowboy craggy and a keening falsetto, sounding like Bon Iver after a strenuous season of rustling cattle or maybe just wearing a lot of denim.\\" - MTV Buzzworthy * \\"Americana, indie rock and singer-songwriter styles all come to mind.

It was last assigned to the Eastern Transport Air Force of Military Air Transport Service (MATS) at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. It performed strategic airlift missions until it was discontinued on 8 January 1966 and replaced by the 437th Military Airlift Wing of Military Airlift Command, which inherited its honors, but not its lineage or history. History The wing was established in 1955 at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina When Military Air Transport Service (MATS) expanded its operations there after assuming jurisdiction of the base from Tactical Air Command three months earlier.Mueller, pp. 87‚Äì90 The 1608th was initially established as a Douglas C-54 Skymaster medium transport unit, transporting cargo within the United States to other USAF stations. It was upgraded to heavy transport wing and re-equipped with long-range intercontinental Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs for cargo transportation and Lockheed C-121 Constellations for passenger overseas transportation. The wing established an aerial port in 1956 for embarkation to and from the United States as well as large air terminal for transshipment of cargo. The 1608th received Lockheed C-130E Hercules transports in 1962 to replace its C-121s. It added jet Lockheed C-141 Starlifters in 1965 to replace the C-124s. In 1963, the wing supported Operation Deep Freeze, earning an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for all wing elements deployed to support the operation.Air Force Pamphlet 900-2, p. 500 As the host for Charleston the wing supported Air Weather Service and Air Rescue Service squadrons and aircraft as well as Air Defense Command interceptor aircraft and other air defense units. The wing was discontinued on 8 January 1966. Its equipment and personnel were reassigned to the 437th Military Airlift Wing the same date. Its history and honors (although not its lineage) were bestowed on the 437th to indicate that its replacement was only a conversion from a major command controlled (MAJCON) wing to an Air Force controlled (AFCON) wing. Its component units with the number 1608 were replaced by units with the new wing's number with the exception of the 1608th USAF Dispensary, which was reassigned to the 437th.

It was first published in 2009. Synopsis This 384 page book for both general reader and economist questions the validity of John Maynard Keynes‚Äôs assumptions. Lewis argues that The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money is based almost exclusively on Keynes‚Äôs intuition rather than on demonstrated logic or solid evidence.Merkel, David. , Book Review: Where Keynes Went Wrong, September 29, 2010. Lewis begins by demystifying Keynes by giving his elaboration of Keynes's writings in General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money and other works. Using claims from the Austrian School of economics and citing historical evidence, Lewis then argues that government policies based on Keynes‚Äôs prescriptions have actually made things worse, not better. Lewis presents alternatives to Keynesian intervention and urges a change in current global policy to foster economic recovery. Critical reception In a January 2011 article published in L'Osservatore Romano, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, the Vatican bank chief, cited the work in his warnings about economic policies of both United States and European governments thus endorsing Hunter Lewis's moral philosophy arguments regarding sustainability and social justice. Belgian Economist Paul De Grauwe gave the book an unfavorable review, describing it as a \\"collection of bullet point presentations\\" that presented \\"no more than a caricature of Keynes' view\\" and argued that \\"Keynes is the great devil because he has legitimized so much of post-war government policies\\".

Leeds hip hop has been noted as a revival of the purist forms of underground hip-hop and stylised by adopting classic elements of East Coast sounds which complement the Leeds underground. Musical style In contrast to the simplistic rhyme patterns utilized in commercial American hip hop music, New Yorkshire hip hop has been noted for its emphasis on lyrical dexterity. It has also been characterized by multi-syllabic rhymes, complex wordplay, a continuous free- flowing delivery and intricate metaphors. While Leeds hip hop does not have a uniform sound or standard style, it tends to gravitate to darker beats and sample of collages. The aggressive and hard-hitting beats of the form were emphasized by such acts as Double D Dagger, Northern Hostility and Defenders of Style while artists such as Matter, Airman GR, Premonition, A-Jam Siin, Dialect, Conflict, Weezy Jefferson, D-Prince, Young-Star Simo, Instance, and Chief Wigz were noted for their lyrical skill. Key producers in the Leeds area who are at the fore front of the sound include Mike D of Subterrania Studios, Jack Danz of DS Fam, and Ghost Town. The style of the Leeds hip-hop music scene also has a very diverse sound, with some artists opting to go for more uptempo instrumentals. Kockee K is one of the original pioneers of the modern era of Leeds hip hop, hailing from the infamous district of Chapeltown. Known for his formidable freestyle skill, he is the product of groups such as B.T.I., Braintax, The Thief and Kaliphz that dominated the Leeds scene and had chart success.

R. Egerton: The Years of Risk, 1859-1864', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 13-30. Through his grandmother, he was a descendant of William of Wykeham and he was educated at Winchester College as Founder's Kin, where he was school captain. He proceeded to New College, Oxford in 1851 where he studied for a bachelor's degree in civil laws. In 1855 he entered Cuddesdon Theological College, founded two years earlier by Bishop Wilberforce, to train as a priest. He was ordained as a deacon on 20 December 1857 and became curate in Deddington in north Oxfordshire. Foundation of Bloxham School By 1859 he was considering emigrating to New Zealand, when he came across a complex of dilapidated neo-Gothic school buildings in the nearby village of Bloxham. Egerton had been considering starting a school for several years, and immediately purchased the buildings for ¬£1,615. Egerton perceived that by the mid-19th century a gap had emerged in Britain‚Äôs education system whereby there was no provision for the emerging middle classes. Bloxham School was founded to act as a school for the sons of professionals, military officers and local landowners in the model of the great public schools, especially that of his own alma mater, Winchester. The school received its first pupil in 1860. In his foundation Egerton was heavily influenced by Nathaniel Woodard, who had established a new model for Anglo-Catholic public schools. Bloxham would eventually become a Woodard School, despite Woodard initially advising Egerton not to found his school. Egerton was influenced by the Oxford Movement and sought to provide a public school education for boys based in Anglo-Catholic principles. He had his new school buildings designed by one of the great architects of the day, George Edmund Street, and the institution was named All Saints' School. Egerton‚Äôs wife, Harriet Egerton, provided much of the early funding for the school.Simon Batten, A Shining Light, A history of Bloxham School, (2010), pg.10-15 Egerton would go on to devote most of the rest of his life to the school, of which he was the first headmaster. A boarding house at Bloxham School is named after the school‚Äôs founder and Egerton's portrait hangs in the school dining hall.http://www.bloxhamschool.com Egerton's political patron was William Ewart Gladstone, who said of Egerton: \\"England, perhaps, owes as much to him in the matter of religious education as any man.\\"Simon Batten, A Shining Light, A history of Bloxham School, (2010), pg.39 Cricket He played cricket for Winchester in 1849 and 1850, appearing each year against Harrow and Eton and being on the losing side every time.

R. Egerton: The Years of Risk, 1859-1864', A History of Bloxham School (H.E. Boddy & Co. Ltd, Banbury, 1978), 24. The Goulds were of considerable wealth and Egerton's uncle questioned his prospects. Thanks to the strong personal support of Bishop Wilberforce, Egerton and Harriet were eventually permitted to marry on 4 November 1862.

He was also one of the founders, the namesake and the first director of the Stan Ackermans Instituut. Biography Ackermans was the son of Rie A.G. Schonk and Anton J.J.M. Ackermans, a high school teacher in Amsterdam. Following his secondary education, Ackermans attended the University of Amsterdam, where he studied mathematics; he graduated under professor N.G. de Bruijn. In 1961 he followed his professor to Eindhoven to work under him again, this time on his Ph.D (which he was granted in 1964). In the period of 1967-68 he worked at UCLA. He was appointed full professor of mathematics back in Eindhoven in 1972, for the chairs of algebra and functional analysis. Ackermans became dean of the mathematics department in 1978; he remained as the dean until 1981, when he became conrector of the university. In 1982 he succeeded Professor Hans Erkelens as rector magnificus. This was also the year of the two-phase structural reformation of higher education in The Netherlands (Dutch: Tweefasenstructuur wetenschappelijk onderwijs) and the financial cutback program Division of labor and concentration (Dutch: Taakverdeling en concentratie), which were mandated by the Ministry of Education. Ackermans completed one term as rector.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is in an isolated position in a field some to the west of Ross-on-Wye. The church is notable for its 13th- century wall paintings, and the presence of a reconstructed Roman altar. History It is said that the church was founded by Herwald, Bishop of Llandaff in 1056. Alterations were made to it in the 13th and 17th centuries, and the church was restored in the late 19th or early 20th century. In 1830, Rev John Webb, the rector, discovered outside a cottage a rectangular stone with a depression on its top that was being used as a mortar. He realised that it was a Roman altar stone, and then found the stem and the base of the altar in the blocked north doorway of the church. The pieces were moved to the church at Tretire, a nearby village, but were returned to Michaelchurch in 1908. The church was declared redundant on 28 July 1972, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 13 November 1973. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone with stone slate roofs. Its plan is simple, consisting of a three bay nave, a two-bay chancel, and a south porch. On the west gable is a bellcote with a pyramidal roof; its walls are rendered. In the north wall of the nave is a blocked doorway now occupied by a 20th-century casement window. In the south wall, to the east of the porch, is a lancet window and a two-light window under a pointed arch. The chancel has two small lancets in the south wall, one similar window in the north wall, and two taller lancets in the east wall. The porch contains stone benches. =Interior= The ceiling of the church is plastered, and the east and south walls of the chancel have refitted 17th-century panels. Elsewhere, on the north, east and south walls, are 13th-century paintings, mainly in red and white, of geometric patterns and floral decorations. On parts of the north and south walls these have been superimposed by 16th and 17th-century black- lettered inscriptions, including the Ten Commandments. Between the nave and the chancel is a wooden screen with a wide central entry and three bays on each side. The lower parts of the bays are panelled, and the upper parts consist of open arches with pendents. The choir stalls date from the 19th- century, and have carved angels as finials. The stone font dates from the 12th century and has a tapering cylindrical bowl carved with a cross and interlacing decoration. The bowl stands on a cylindrical stem and a circular base. Near the font is a 14th-century coffin lid carved with a cross in a circle. The lectern probably dates from the 19th century. The reconstructed Roman altar stands in the blocked north doorway. It carries a badly worn inscription that can be roughly translated as \\"To the god of the three ways (crossroads), Beccicus dedicates this altar\\". External features The churchyard contains the war grave of a World War I soldier to the south-east of the church, and that of a Second World War Royal Navy officer to the north of the church.

Its mission is to see UK airports grow sustainably. The AOA represents some 50+ UK airports and general aviation airfields in the UK. History The AOA was formed in 1934 as the Aerodrome Owners' Association. On 17 April 1990 it became the Airport Operators Association. Structure It represents 50+ airports and around 160 companies and organisations which do not own airports, but operate in the aviation industry. Function The AOA is the organisation which speaks on behalf of UK airports. It engages with the UK Government, parliamentarians and regulatory authorities to secure policy outcomes that support sustainable growth in the aviation sector. Policy and campaigning remains at the heart of how it promotes the UK airports sector and communicates its message to political and public audiences. It engages actively with key decision makers, and makes a positive case that the airports sector is vital for promoting jobs, growth and economic sustainability for UK plc. It calls for pro-aviation policies, such as an end to increases in Air Passenger Duty (APD), and a planning and regulatory regime which supports both a network of vibrant point- to-point airports and world-class hub capacity. It is an active member of the A Fair Tax on Flying campaign, a coalition of more than 30 leading travel and aviation organisations including airlines, airports, trade associations and destinations who believe that APD is too high and is particularly damaging to jobs, growth and the UK's connectivity with the world. The AOA is also a member of Sustainable Aviation, a coalition of the UK‚Äôs airports, airlines, aircraft and engine manufacturers, and air traffic management providers, launched in 2005 to allow the industry to come together to tackle the challenges of delivering a sustainable future for aviation: for example, dealing with carbon emissions, noise and local impacts around airports. Its trade journal is called the \\"Airport Operator\\" and is published three times a year. The AOA organises a number of events throughout the year, including an annual dinner, the principal aviation dinner in Europe; an Annual Conference; a summer reception and conferences on environment; security and operations & safety.

Codiponte is a village in the municipality of Casola in Lunigiana, Tuscany, Italy. It is located in the Province of Massa and Carrara and is about 20 minutes drive from the comune of Aulla. The population is about 200. Codiponte lies in the shadow of the Alpi Apuane and in the valley of the River Aullela. It is 255 metres above sea level and has a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters including snowfalls during winter. Summer temperatures are in the high 30¬∞s and winters around 0 ¬∞C. History Codiponte was once an important stopping place on the Via Francigena for pilgrims travelling to Rome. Overlooking the village are ruins from the 13th- century \\"Castile Codiponte\\" and the \\"Convent of Clarisse of Santa Maria del Castellaro\\". Because of its strategic position, during the failed 1521 French siege of Parma, Codiponte was sacked by Franco-Venetian forces under Federigo da Bozzolo who were endeavouring to enter Parma. Under instructions from the Duke of Urbino and Francesco Guicciardini, Italian general Marcantonio Colonna ordered the abandonment of the town and imperial defences regrouped near Parma. However, Parma was ultimately held by the Italians and the French forces withdrew. The campaign was a prelude to the Battle of Bicocca led by the Vicomte de Lautrec. A stone bridge with three arches which was built in 1703 and repaired in 1936. A new bridge 500 metres downstream was built in 1970. A Roman village is believed to have been located on the northern approach to the bridge near the church. Church The village has a 17th- century campanile and the medieval \\"Pieve dei Santi Cornelio e Cipriano\\", which is dedicated to the Saints Cornelius and Cyprian. A noticeboard in the church reads: The church is believed to have been in ruins when it was rebuilt in the Romanesque style in the 12th century and restored after a landslide in the 14th century. The campanile was built in the 17th century. A triptych of the Madonna and Child, Saints Cornelius and Cyprian, and Jesus was made around 1440.

In 1956 de Mendieta announced his conversion to the Church of England. He left Belgium and moved to Great Britain, where he was received into the Church. After several years of teaching at various smaller colleges, he was named a canon, that is a canon residentiary, of Winchester Cathedral and thus a member of the Cathedral Chapter. Of studious disposition his career at the cathedral reflected his monastic experience in his general lack of knowledge of some standard procedures of modern life. Publishing in several European languages, he continued to live a relatively secluded existence after his move to England. De Mendieta's acceptance of an office in the Anglican Church invited a journalist's comparison with the case of de Dominis' appointment to the Deanery of Windsor under King James I. It was also subsequently noted that the 20th-century cleric, Charles Davis, did not opt for a similar route when he left the Roman Catholic Church.

The artwork, created in 1995, takes the whole park as its theme, and includes a gazebo in the middle of the park with handles of tools and grills forming the ornamental grillwork. There are also decorative chains around the park spelling out popular labor slogans, as well as graphic panels explaining significant moments in Wisconsin's labor history.Wisconsin Labor Society Newsletter.(Winter 1995)Vol. 12 No. 3. Description Agnew and Zebells' Wisconsin Workers Memorial makes use of the entire Zeidler Park, integrating landscape and sculpture to create the final work. The designers kept in mind the park's character when creating the memorial. They believed that the park resembled a 19th-century village green, and thus created a gazebo that resembles a bandstand as the symbol of a democratic gathering place. The gazebo, situated in the middle of the park, is decorated with salvaged gears and tools of the modern workplace. There is a huge clock inside the edifice, referencing the time spent at work as well as the fight for the eight-hour workday., Terese Agnew website. The bandstand is accessible by wheelchair ramps, which serve as a useful reminder of workers injured on the job. Paths lined with ornamental chains and bollards lead from the sidewalk up to the structure. The chains display popular labor slogans and tell the story of Milwaukee's labor history from 1800 to the present through graphic panels stating important historical facts. The memorial is designed to commemorate the workers who have faced dangers and hazards on their job, as well as the struggles to overcome these hazards, thus the emphasis on Wisconsin labor history. \\"We want to find personal stories and worker experiences that illustrate milestones in the history of working men and women,,' said Zebell, a landscape architect, and Agnew, a public sculptor. 'Wisconsin is so important nationally for being a first in legislature such as Workers Compensation.\\" The Wisconsin Workers Memorial has been a collaboration between the Milwaukee Labor Council and the Wisconsin Labor History Society. Terese Agnew and Mary Zebell's design was chosen in a competition sponsored by the Milwaukee County Labor Council and the Milwaukee County Parks Design and Review Committee., You can help Milwaukee artist fight sweatshops. Information The gazebo/bandstand located in the middle of the park is the focal point of the memorial. It commemorates Wisconsin workers' tools, while emphasizing the struggles encountered by the laborers. The fabricating of all the ornamental grillwork, which is composed of salvaged gears, was done by skilled union members. A drive was held in order to raise funds to pay for the artwork. The Wisconsin Workers Memorial was dedicated on April 28, 1995. The Wisconsin Labor Society was the original sponsor for the project, but it is currently managed by the Milwaukee County Labor Council., Milwaukee Labor Council. Each year the site is used as a gathering point for Workers Memorial Day, which is held on April 28 to honor workers who have been killed or injured on the job. It is also the staging point for Milwaukee's annual Labor Parade on Labor Day. Artist Terese Agnew was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1959. Her parents encouraged her to pursue art, while her stepfather, who was a labor organizer, introduced her to the laborers' struggles worldwide., Museum of Art and Design. This later became a central theme in Agnew's work. She attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee from 1981 to 1984 where she studied painting and sculpture. Agnew began her career as a public sculptor, creating works such as the Wisconsin Workers Memorial and her 35 concrete tree stumps at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts in Brookfield, Wisconsin. She became notorious when in 1985 she wrapped a \\"huge fiberglass sculpture of a dragon around a Gothic Revival water tower on the east side of Milwaukee- an intervention that required months of legal wrangling but was only a five day installation.\\", Porcupine Literary Arts Magazine. The artist also started making quilts in 1990 centering, just as her sculpture, on themes of freedom, human dignity and man's role in nature. She is well known for engaging with public space and communities, as well as devoting as much time and effort as is necessary to achieve the desired aesthetic effect.

This allows more extensive and precise quantification of muscle properties than in vivo testing. In vitro muscle testing has provided the bulk of scientific knowledge on muscle structure and physiology, as well as how both relate to organismal performance. Isolation of Tissue for In Vitro Testing Once an appropriate animal has been selected for experimentation, whether that is for a specific locomotor function (i.e. frogs for jumping) or a specific animal strain, to answer a research question, a specific muscle is identified based on its in vivo function and fibre type distribution. Firstly, following ethical approval, and if necessary government approval, the animal is humanely euthanised. Humane methods of sacrifice differ per country, with the most appropriate method selected based on ethical approval and researcher skill level. A number of further criteria should be followed to ensure the animal is completely dead without the possibility of recovery, which includes cessation of blood flow via the removal of the heart from the circulatory system and/or complete destruction of the brain and spinal column. Following this, common measures of animal morphology are usually rapidly obtained, such as animal length, animal body mass and other biomechanical markers that may be of importance. Once collected, the animal is then prepared appropriately for the harvesting of the target muscle. In isolated muscles, these tend to be muscles of the hind limbs, such as the soleus or EDL of mammals, or the plantaris or iliotibialis of amphibians. Other muscles that have been examined under in vitro conditions include the diaphragm and the papillary muscle. For the successful isolation of skeletal muscles, specific conditions are required. The tissue should be isolated in frequently changed, chilled Ringer's solution or Krebs-Henseleit solution to ensure metabolic conditions are slowed down, hence the need for chilled dissecting medium, and to prevent the tissue from dying due to lack of substrates within the medium, hence the requirement for the solutions to be changed frequently. The dissecting solution should be continually oxygenated with the appropriate concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide for the tissue that is being prepared. Typically, non-mammalian tissues are prepared in a gaseous solution bubbled through with 98% oxygen, 2% carbon dioxide whilst mammalian tissues in a solution bubbled through with 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide. A microscope with an appropriate magnification level is required due to the dexterity required for isolation of muscles. An external, fibre optic light source is also beneficial to provide sufficient light without the emission of heat. There is no correct approach for the preparation of muscles for testing, as long as the muscle is not damaged during preparation, the muscle-tendon unit is intact and there is something that can be used to anchor the muscle within the testing rig. Pieces of bone can be left at the proximal and/or distal end of skeletal muscles to allow for anchoring. In addition, silk sutures or aluminium T-foil clips can be used to wrap around the tendon of the muscle to provide both support at the tendon and to be used for anchoring in the mechanics rig. Equipment In vitro muscle testing typically requires a dual-mode servomotor, which can both control and detect changes in force and length. Should a dual-mode system be unavailable, then an independent force transducer and motor arm can be used. One end of the sample tissue is anchored in place, via a needle if sutured or crocodile clip if prepared with aluminium T-foil clips, while the other end is attached to the servomotor. The entire muscle is bathed in Ringer's solution or Krebs- Henseleit solution with oxygen bubbling through in order to keep the tissue alive and metabolically active. The solution is heated, usually via an external heater/cooler water bath, to an appropriate test temperature for the muscle that is being tested. Muscles are stimulated to contract by applying electric current to either the nerve which innervates the muscle or via platinum electrodes placed in the circulating solution to evoke a response of the entire muscle. The servomotor detects changes in force and/or length due to muscle contraction. Stimulation level is often set to the level which ensures maximal motor unit recruitment. The servomotor can be programmed to maintain a given force while allowing the muscle to change length, vice versa, or the muscle may be subject to more complex testing, such as in work loops. When pennate muscles are used, sonomicrometry is often used to accurately determine fiber length during the test. Scale In vitro muscle testing can be done on any scale of muscle organization - entire groups of muscles (provided they share a common insertion or origin, as in the human quadriceps), a single muscle, a \\"bundle\\" of muscle fibers, a single muscle fiber, a single myofibril, a single sarcomere, a cardiomyocyte or even a half- sarcomere. Muscle fibers may be intact, or may be \\"skinned\\", a process which removes the cell membrane, sarcoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasm, allowing greater access to the contractile components of the sarcomere. Typical Properties Tested Several properties are commonly tested, and a given experiment will often use a subset of these properties, including twitch times, tetanic force, force-length relationship, force velocity relationship, work loops, fatigue trials, fusion frequency, and energetic cost. In situ A hybrid approach between in vitro and in vivo has recently been used, called in situ, in which the organism is put under terminal anesthesia, and in vivo tests are performed with the muscle still attached to the organism. This ensures the muscle is kept at the right temperature and amply supplied with nutrients and oxygen by the blood, but the procedure is more difficult and some tests may not be possible. Single Fibre Testing Species In vitro muscle testing is almost never used in humans, with the exception of small sections of muscle removed via biopsy or while undergoing surgery for other ailments. Testing is generally more difficult in mammals and birds because of the high temperature and oxygen requirements of the muscle, leading to rapid cell death once muscle tissue is removed from the organism. Mammalian skeletal muscles are commonly tested at ~25¬∞C to prolong the test protocol for as long as reasonably possible. A test temperature of ~37¬∞C can also been used during testing of whole isolated mammalian skeletal muscles to better replicate the temperature found in in vivo. Moreover, it is important to consider the thermal specialisation of skeletal muscles, with core muscles more susceptible to changes in mechanical performance with small temperature changes than peripheral muscles. In ectotherms (reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates), the muscle tissue can survive outside of the organism for hours or even days, depending on the temperature and organism. Many experiments are conducted at or near 0¬∞C to prolong the usable life of the muscle. Additionally, in fish and amphibians, it is possible to separate out a single muscle fiber while keeping it intact, but in other species, this is usually not possible.

Lady Zhang's son Zhu Youzhen would later be the final emperor of Later Liang.  Background  It is not known when Lady Zhang was born. She was from a rich household in Dangshan (Á¢≠Â±±, in modern Suzhou, Anhui),New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 13. where Zhu Quanzhong was from as well.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 1. Despite her family's wealth, she married Zhu Quanzhong (who was then still named Zhu Wen) before he became prominent. She was the mother of his fourth son Zhu Youzhen.  During Zhu Quanzhong's campaigns  After Zhu Quanzhong became a prominent warlord (military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan)), Lady Zhang, as his wife, was created the Lady of Wei. It was said that she was understanding, intelligent, and respectful, and even though Zhu was harsh and violent in his character, he feared her. He often consulted her on important decisions, and she often made the right decisions. It was often became of her intercession that people that he wanted to kill were saved. On one occasion, when Zhu had already embarked on a campaign, she believed that the campaign was unwise and sent a messenger to inform him of her opinion. Because of her opinion, he cancelled the campaign and returned.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 893, she had the occasion to save Zhu's oldest son Zhu Youyu (), who was not her son. At that time, Zhu Quanzhong had put Zhu Youyu in charge of sieging Pengcheng, the capital of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), then governed by Zhu Quanzhong's rival Shi Pu. Shi repeatedly challenged Zhu Youyu to battles, but Zhu Youyu refused to engage him. When Shi's ally Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) made an attempt to relieve the siege in early 893, Zhu Youyu, after defeating Zhu Jin and forcing him to flee, did not give chase. For both of these decisions, Zhu Quanzhong's adopted son Zhu Yougong (), who was serving under Zhu Youyu, wrote Zhu Quanzhong secretly and made false accusations against Zhu Youyu. Zhu Quanzhong, in anger, issued a harshly-worded letter to Zhu Youyu's deputy Pang Shigu (), ordering him to take over the command from and investigate Zhu Youyu. The letter was accidentally sent to Zhu Youyu instead, and when Zhu Youyu received the letter, he feared punishment, so he abandoned his post and fled to Dangshan, to the house of his uncle, Zhu Quanzhong's older brother Zhu Quanyu () to take refuge there. When Lady Zhang heard about this, she persuaded Zhu Youyu to return to Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture () to meet his father. Under her direction, he knelt down and tearfully apologized. Zhu Quanzhong nevertheless seized him and was prepared to execute him, when Lady Zhang grabbed him and tearfully stated herself, \\"You have left your army and returned yourself to face the consequences. Nothing could show your intentions clearer.\\" Hearing her statement, Zhu Quanzhong understood what she meant and released Zhu Youyu, sending him to govern Xu Prefecture (Ë®±Â∑û, in modern Xuchang, Henan) instead. By 897, Zhu Quanzhong had finally defeated Shi, Zhu Jin, and Zhu Jin's cousin Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), seizing their territories. As part of his defeat of Zhu Jin (who fled south to Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to Huainan's military governor Yang Xingmi), Zhu Quanzhong captured Zhu Jin's wife and made her a concubine. When Lady Zhang, hearing the news of the victory, met Zhu Quanzhong at Fengqiu (Â∞Å‰∏ò, in modern Xinxiang, Henan), Zhu Quanzhong informed her that he had taken Zhu Jin's wife as a concubine. She asked to see Zhu Jin's wife, and Zhu Jin's wife bowed down to her ‚Äî as would appropriate when a concubine were meeting the wife. She bowed in return and stated:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Zhu Quanzhong came to an understanding that Lady Zhang viewed this as inappropriate, and allowed Zhu Jin's wife to become a Buddhist nun. On one occasion when Zhu Quanzhong had just completed a campaign against Wang Ke the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), defeating Wang and seizing Hezhong Circuit, and was poised to attack the major rival Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), he, upon hearing news that Lady Zhang was seriously ill, left the battlefield himself and quickly returned to Bian Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.  Death and posthumous honors  Lady Zhang died in 904. (It was said that after her death, Zhu Quanzhong became far more indiscriminating in pursuit of women, including, eventually, his daughters-in- law.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. After Zhu Quanzhong took over the Tang throne and established a new Later Liang in 907 (as its Emperor Taizu),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. for reasons unclear in history, he did not posthumously honor her as empress, only as an imperial consort with the title of Xianfei (). After Zhu Youzhen became emperor in 913, he posthumously honored her as empress and reburied her at Zhu Quanzhong's tomb.

He was from Delano, Pennsylvania. In 1892, he was suspected of being a paid ringer for the then-amateur Pittsburgh Athletic Club. According to the story, the Pittsburgh A.C. was in need of a replacement at center, due to their regular player being injured. The team was also days away from playing their rival, the Allegheny Athletic Association. Then Pittsburgh captain Charley Aull reportedly ran into an old friend named \\"Stayer\\". Both teams agreed to let \\"Stayer\\" play in the place of the injured center. A week later it was discovered that \\"Stayer\\" was actually Read. Although no one could prove that Read actually had been paid, and Aull had not tried to present him as a Pittsburgh A.C. member, the incident raised tensions between both clubs. Now no club would hesitate to use ringers or professional players. Allegheny then hired, under the table, Pudge Heffelfinger, a college star formerly from Yale, for $500, to play for the club in a November 21 rematch. This game made Heffelfinger the first professional football player. Read played against the Pittsburgh A.C. on November 5, 1892, when Penn State defeated the club 16‚Äì0. Read played center all season for the Pittsburgh A.C the following season; although no contract was discovered, he is believed to have been paid for his services. Read later served on the Penn State Board of Trustees. He died in 1916 after a short illness aged 47.

It is Singh's debut Hindi film, and is also the directorial debut of director Maneesh Sharma. The film is a love story set in the world of wedding planning. It was released worldwide on 10 December 2010. The film received universal critical acclaim and commercial success despite initial competition from No Problem and Tees Maar Khan. It became popular for its fresh subject and screenplay and turned out to be one of the most successful and awarded movies of the year. A Tamil remake titled Aaha Kalyanam also produced by Aditya Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner, starring Nani and Vaani Kapoor in the lead roles was released on 21 February 2014. It was unofficially remade in Telugu in 2013 titled as Jabardasth, directed by Nandini Reddy. Plot Bittoo Sharma (Ranveer Singh) is street-smart and fun-loving. He gatecrashes a wedding for free food, and Shruti Kakkar (Anushka Sharma), an intelligent and quirky girl who is assisting the wedding coordinator, confronts him. Bittoo pretends he is part of the film crew and makes a video of her performance when he sees her dancing at the wedding. The next day, he tries to impress Shruti with a DVD he compiled of her dance at the wedding. Shruti is not interested in flirting and reveals her main interest is becoming a wedding planner. Bittoo is under pressure from his father (Govind Pandey) to come back to the village and work on sugarcane fields; Shruti is being coaxed into marriage as soon as possible by her relatives. After her exams end, Shruti makes a deal with her parents that she has five years to get her business up and running before they arrange a marriage. When Bittoo's father comes to take him back to his village, Bittoo lies he cannot come back because he is starting a wedding planning business. He goes to Shruti with the idea of becoming her business partner, but she refuses because she is worried a partnership might lead to a romantic complication. She tells Bittoo the number one rule of business is not let love get in the way. Shruti and Bittoo go to meet Chanda Narang (Shena Gamat), a famous wedding planner, in hopes Chanda will hire Shruti. Chanda shows no interest in Shruti but loses one of her male workers and offers Bittoo the job. Bittoo accepts on the condition he and Shruti are hired together. On the job, Shruti learns Chanda has bad work ethic, cheats her clients, and delivers nothing according to their wishes. When a client confronts Chanda, she blames Shruti. Bittoo defends Shruti and the two of them quit and form their own company, Shruti's original idea of Shaadi Mubaarak (Congratulations on the Wedding). They begin with small, low-budget projects and gradually work their way up. They finally get their first big client. The wedding is a huge success and that night they celebrate, ending up drunk and later having sex. Bittoo lies awake all night, worried since Shruti had warned against this. Bittoo behaves awkwardly around Shruti, while she realizes she has fallen in love with him. She tries to reassure him she's not like other girls. Bittoo is relieved but misunderstands her words and believes she's telling him their night of passion didn't mean anything to her. He is relieved and cites her own rule that love should not get in the way of business. Shruti pretends to agree with him but is despondent and heartbroken. She consoles herself and tries to act normally, but her resentment for Bittoo keeps increasing. This creates a tense atmosphere, eventually leading to a huge fight after the wedding of one of their clients. Shruti breaks the partnership, forcing Bittoo to leave the company. Bittoo starts his own wedding planning business called \\"Happy Wedding\\". However, they both perform terribly by themselves and end up plunging into debt. They get a big contract but it is contingent upon them working together. Facing debt collectors, they agree to partner up again for the sake of recovering their losses. They divvy the workload, falling back into their old rhythm. The next day, Bittoo tells Shruti they should be partners again. Shruti refuses his offer, telling him she will marry her fianc√© Chetan and will move to Dubai. Bittoo is stunned and pesters her during the rest of the wedding preparations, coming up with various excuses why she shouldn't marry Chetan. As a last resort, he accuses her of her wanting to wed to exact revenge on him. Shruti tells Bittoo she is doing it for her parents and because Chetan is right for her, and admits she did fall in love with him, but since he didn't feel the same, she has moved on. Bittoo realizes he has been in love with Shruti all along but was too scared to acknowledge the feelings he had for her. Desperate to win her back, Bittoo calls Chetan, telling him to buzz off as he loves Shruti. Hearing this, Shruti confronts Bittoo. He tells her he was an idiot to have run away from her love, but also playfully chides her, asking why she couldn't have taught him true love the way she taught him the ropes of the business world. Shruti calls Chetan and calls off her engagement to him. She and Bittoo then share a kiss. The film ends with Shruti and Bittoo dancing at their own wedding with all the clientele, friends, and family to the tune of \\"Ainvayi Ainvayi\\".

Soundtrack The score and songs of the film were composed by the duo Salim‚ÄìSulaiman who've composed music for many other Yash Raj Films productions before, including Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, which had already united actress Anushka Sharma with director Maneesh Sharma, who was then still an assistant director. The lyrics to the various songs were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and playback singers include Sunidhi Chauhan, Benny Dayal, Shreya Ghoshal, Natalie Di Luccio, Himani Kapoor, Harshdeep Kaur, Labh Janjua, Shrraddha Pandit, Master Saleem, Sukhwinder Singh, Amitabh Bhattacharya and Salim Merchant. The soundtrack was revealed on 19 October 2010, at the Yash Raj Studios in Andheri, Mumbai,\\"Anushka Sharma: Adorable at Band Baaja Baaraat Music Launch\\", SawfNews.com, 20 October 2010. and was commercially released on 3 NovemberTNN \\"Salman thanks Akshay, SRK enjoys alone time\\", The Times of India, 28 October 2010. with a launch event happening at the Reliance TimeOut store in Bandra.Prateeksha Khot \\"At the Music Launch of Band Baaja Baarat\\", BollySpice.com, 3 November 2010.

Writing for ApunKa Choice, Usha Lakra titled her review \\"Band, Baaja, Bland\\" and noted that while \\"the album has its moments\\" and \\"the tracks are composed strictly keeping in mind the theme of the movie\\", all-in-all Ainvayi Ainvayi was the only chartbuster of the album.

Established in 1955, the institute is a division of Osmania University. The institute is named after Sir Ronald Ross, winner of Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, 1902.  History  Sir Ronald Ross was posted as a general duty medical officer to the regiment stationed in Secunderabad in 1893. Though he was a surgeon by qualification, Ross was attracted towards research in tropical diseases, especially malaria. During his posting, he worked on his research from a laboratory in the old Begumpet military hospital building. Built in 1895, this building was surrounded by marshes which proved rather helpful for his research experiments. It was in this building on 20 August 1897 that he made the discovery of the malarial parasite inside the body of a mosquito. His study confirmed that mosquitoes were the carriers of malaria parasite. For his work in demonstrating the life-cycle of the parasites of malaria in mosquitoes, and thus establishing the hypothesis of Laveran and Manson, Ross was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. In 1955, Satyanarayan Singh, a Professor of Zoology at Hyderabad's Osmania University acquired the building from the then Deccan Airlines and established the Malaria Research Institute in this building. Research scholars from Osmania University and Osmania Medical College worked here until the building was taken over by the Airports Authority of India. A pilot training center was set up in this building. Former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, was trained in this building. In 1979, Osmania University took over the building and continued research here.  Restoration of the building's heritage  In 1935, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, the local civic agency, installed a marble tablet in appreciation of Ross' achievement. In 1997, about 700 scientists from 30 countries gathered at this building to commemorate the centennial of Ronald Ross' discovery. On this occasion, the building was renovated at the cost of by the British High Commission. Being a heritage building, the Archaeological Survey of India granted 650,000 for its further development. In addition, a plan was announced to convert the facility into a center of excellence and develop the landscape around the building. Despite spending money on renovation, the building was not properly maintained. In 2008, the state government formed a committee for the restoration, conservation and promotion of the building as tourist destination. A grant of 4 million was to be utilised for developing a horticulture park and relocation of airport offices. Upon the completion of restoration, the local tourism department was set to promote the building and its heritage as a destination for national and international tourists. Despite several attempts to revive the facility, the building lies secluded and devoid of academic or research activity and without steady source of financial support. Lack of political will and lack of bureaucracy was blamed for its current state. Bodies like the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and researchers from University of York have expressed interest in attaching themselves with the institute.

He gained notice for his portrayals of Brunel's steamships Great Western and Great Britain. Life Walter was born in Bristol and died there, but was living in Portishead at the time that he exhibited his first known work, View from Portishead towards Wales (1832). This was at the Bristol Institution in 1832, in the first exhibition of the Bristol Society of Artists. He is not known to have been associated with the Bristol School of artists in the 1820s. However surviving sketches suggest that he did take part in the revival of the school's sketching meetings in the 1830s. His drawing technique shows similarities to that of the leading Bristol School artist Samuel Jackson. Walter's subjects included shipping at Bristol, Southampton, Malta and Saint Lucia. He also portrayed Dutch vessels in the style of the Dutch artists Van de Velde and son, for example in Dutch vessels in a fresh breeze (c. 1851). He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1837, and also at the Society of British Artists.

A Glossary of Technical Terms Used in Botany, p.100, Bradbury and Evans, London, 1848. A leaf whorl consists of at least three elements; a pair of opposite leaves is not called a whorl. The morphology of most flowering plants is based on four types of whorls: # The calyx: zero or more whorls of sepals at the base # The corolla: zero or more whorls of petals above the calyx # The androecium: zero or more whorls of stamens, each comprising a filament and an anther # The gynoecium: zero or more whorls of carpels, each consisting of an ovary, a style, and a stigma A flower lacking any of these floral structures is said to be incomplete or imperfect. Not all flowers consist of whorls since the parts may instead be spirally arranged, as in the family Magnoliaceae. For leaves to grow in whorls is fairly unusual except in plant species with very short internodes. Leaf whorls occur in some trees such as Brabejum stellatifolium and other species in the family Proteaceae (e.g., in the genus Banksia). In plants such as these, crowded internodes within the leaf whorls alternate with long internodes between the whorls.

The Tiger was always very closely related to the Titan of its time, sharing a ladder type frame dropped in the wheelbase and gently rising in curves over the axles, generally only differing in wheelbase. Pre-war Leyland Tiger TS series In conjunction with the original Titan, Leyland Motors offered the same mechanical advances in a single-deck bus or coach chassis, in half-cab (forward-control) form this was called the Tiger, with normal-control derivatives with the driver behind the engine bonnet and sharing the saloon with the passengers generally being called Tigress. The Tiger from 1927-42 went through derivatives from TS1 to TS11. =Origins and prototypes= The Leyland Titan TD1 was unveiled at the Commercial Motor show at London's Olympia exhibition hall in November 1927, it was then unique amongst double deckers in having a light enough frame to run two-axled on pneumatic tyres (two at the front and four at the back) yet carry 52 passengers in a bus of overall length, with such refinements as a six-cylinder overhead-camshaft petrol engine and an unprecedentedly-low frame. The Tiger TS1 was its single‚Äìdeck counterpart. The wheelbase was slightly longer at allowing bodywork up to long, with up to 35 seats. The first Tiger TS1 (chassis 60001A), bodied by Leyland was loaned in March 1927 to H.M.S. Catherwood Ltd of Belfast, it was purchased by them and, sold to other firms, it worked in Ireland until 1940. =Variants= At the time the Tiger was launched there were no rules across Great Britain on a bus or coach's overall dimensions; these depended on what a local council empowered to licence vehicles to an operator would allow. In response to varied demand, the TS1 was curtailed to become the TS2, which had the same wheelbase but an overall body length of , and then the TS3 was introduced for the same body length, but with the Titan's wheelbase. Later, the TS8 was revised with a shorter bonnet to become the TS8 (special). SMT and Alexanders especially favoured that type as it could seat 39 rather than 35 in the maximum length allowed for two-axle single deckers (see later). =Instant success= Not only did the Tiger catch the imagination of British Isles fleet-owners looking for better performance from their buses and coaches it also sold overseas to Sweden, South Africa, India, New Zealand, Canada, Argentina and Australia, the Canadian versions being lengthened to a wheel-base, for a 30 ft body and having the engines uprated to 100 bhp, geared to a top speed of . =Later derivatives= TS4 was a type-mnemonic given to an interim Tiger with Titan TD2 features. TS5 was omitted as it was felt this would cause confusion with the contemporary Leyland Lion LT5. The next thoroughly new type was the TS6 from January 1933; this had all the improvements afforded to the contemporary TD3 Titan, including the neater front radiator and bonnet assembly, but the same wheelbase and overall-length as the TS1. For operators requiring 30 ft long single‚Äìdecks a TS6D or TS6T Tiger was made available from 1934, the TS6D was 6x4 and the TS6T 6x2 with only the leading axle in the rear bogie powered. The TS7 and TS8 (and three-axled variants) were similarly derived from the TD4 and TD5 Titans, adopting their features. The suffix c (e.g., TS8c) indicated a torque-converter transmission. The TS9 and TS10 Tigers were never released for sale but the TS11 was equivalent to the TD7 Titan although very few were built, most during World War II. During that war, the SMT group of bus companies in Scotland, converted many of their two and three-axle Tigers to Titan specification and fitted double-deck 55-seat bodies to them. During the 1930s, the Leyland 8.6-litre diesel engine became more common in bus and then coach Tigers and by the end of the decade, very few operators were taking full-sized Leyland buses or coaches with petrol engines. Leyland did not offer a full-size petrol engine after the war. =Tigresses and Lionesses= Very few of the initial Leyland Tigress (TB1) were built; instead Tiger running- units in the existing Leyland Lioness frame produced the Leyland Lioness-Six, model LTB1. In the mid-1930s with Lioness frames exhausted the later full-size Normal-control Leyland-built single decks were called Tigresses, an L prefix was added for left-hand drive versions, such as the large batch of LLTB3 ordered by Riga City Council. 71 of the ordered 90 of which were delivered to Latvia before the outbreak of the Second World War. The only UK customers for Tigresses were exclusive up-market coach-tour firms like Southdown Motor Services who took the LTB3 (equivalent to the TS6) or the LTB5 (equivalent to the TS8). =The FEC= In conjunction with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was basically the same as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that same way as the gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and as the air pressure leaked off, it was not possible to disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built but 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches. =The Gnu and Panda= These were single deckers with twin-steering front axles. The Gnu had a front-mounted vertical engine and either front or central doors. The TEP1 sold three, two to Scottish operator Walter Alexander who built 41-seat front entrance bus and coach bodies, the first one a 1937 Earls' Court show exhibit. The other one went to City Coach Company of Brentwood Essex, who fitted a centre-door 43-seat Duple body. City had bought large numbers of three-axle Tigers and was the only customer for the TEC2 Gnu, designed for centre-entrance bodywork, and having much more in common with the Leyland Steer lorry. The sole Leyland Panda entered service with Walter Alexander in 1941, it had an underfloor engine, like the FEC, but lacked the forward entrance of that operator's Gnus, it was bodied by Alexander with 45 seats and a central entrance to a semi-utility outline. =Enigma, The LS1= BFU225, entered service with the Lincolnshire Road Car Company in early 1941, the operator called it \\"Leyland light-six prototype model LS1\\". It had a 6.2-litre push-rod overhead-valve Leyland engine and a radiator shell of Tiger outline, but as thin across as a Lion or Cheetah's radiator shell. It ran with its 35-seat Leyland body until the mid-1950s. BFU225's engine-design was bored and stroked for use in tanks, and it then became the 7.4-litre 100 bhp E181 engine used in early post-war Titans and Tigers. Postwar Leyland Tiger PS series The postwar Leyland Tiger built from 1946‚Äì68 sold well at home and overseas. After about 1950 however many customers, especially at home but also in export markets decided they preferred the greater carrying capacity of the underfloor-engined vehicle so Tiger sales reduced as models such as the Olympic, Royal Tiger, Tiger Cub and Worldmaster were launched. That said the Tiger was very reliable, very simple to work upon and very durable and continued to sell in a profitable niche in 'dirt road' markets until the lines were closed in 1968. Whilst retaining the dimensions of the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100 bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position. PS1 buses sold well, customers ranging in size from London Transport (who took two batches totalling 131 buses) through municipal fleets, members of the British Electric Traction and British Transport Commission groups through independent regional firms to small independents, although there were competitive chassis from Albion Motors, Associated Equipment Company, Bristol, Crossley Motors, Daimler, Dennis, Foden, Guy, Maudslay, Thornycroft and Tilling-Stevens, the Tiger vied with the AEC Regal for market leadership. Outside Great Britain the PS1 also went to Jersey, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. There was only one mass-produced derivative of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This was coded PS1/1, and was a very strong seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol- engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s. The PS2 followed the PD2 Titan in having the 125 bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine and a new synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous different versions of the home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a wheelbase for bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of for long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK. The export range, from 1948 were the OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also featured the O600 engine and synchromesh gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies could be as long as where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced at the same time as the OPS2 but had a wheelbase for bodies up to long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new length was legalised in 1950. C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (CI√â), the Irish state transport undertaking uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a wheelbase for a bodied length of , Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century. =Six- wheelers= One Heaver-bodied coach for City Coach Company, Romford and two deck and a half airport coaches bodied by the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board for their own use were built to a twin-steering three-axle specification with the second steering axle, which had 17-inch rather than 21-inch wheels, designed to be readily removed once 30 ft length on two axles was legal. City had pre-war operated the largest fleet of the Leyland Gnu twin-steering single decker, switching to them from conventional six-wheeled Tigers. All three were later converted into Titans, the City coach by Barton Transport and the two Northern Irish vehicles by the Ulster Transport Authority. The City coach was the sole wide PS2/10, the NIRTB/UTA pair were wide, hence PS2/11. =Red Worms= Danish state railways took some shortened PS2s together with B√ºssing units to pull semi-trailer buses built by DAB. These were known as \\"Red Worms\\" and worked a high capacity route in suburban Copenhagen in company with Leyland-bodied Titan and Northern Counties bodied Guy Arab double deckers. =Israeli Tigresses= Dan and Egged, the two Israeli bus co-operatives, had used normal-control former US military vehicles as buses just after the end of World War II, Leyland Ashdod therefore persuaded the Farington works to build LOPSU3‚Äôs for this market to normal control, they were known as Tigresses after the pre-war LTB bonneted type, but were recorded as Tigers with no separate model designation. Bodies were built in Israel by Ha'argaz and Merkavim. Royal Tigers and Worldmasters followed as did two examples of the PSR1 Lion. =Indian Tigers= In 1955, although the Comet built in India from 1953 was selling phenomenally well there was a demand for heavier duty single decks. Ashok Leyland, the Indian-based joint venture, started producing its own version of the Tiger, which used the axles of the Ashok Leyland Hippo lorry. It could be seen as a group replacement for the Albion Viking (CX/HD series). =Rebuilding= The outdated layout of the half-cab single deck and its low seating capacity exercised the minds of a number of operators from the mid-1950s. Barton Transport converted PS1s to long double-deckers and Tiger PS2s, including the former City coach to 30 ft double deckers, the later ones carrying fully fronted Northern Counties double-deck bodies. Yorkshire Traction, in the BET group did systematic conversions of most of their fleet of Tigers from about 1955-63, using Charles H. Roe or Northern Counties bodies, Yorkshire Woollen District later following suit. Yorkshire Traction also oversaw the rebodying of five PS2s for Stratford Blue Motors, costed refurbishing the chassis at ¬£500 and purchasing the bodies at ¬£3,000 per bus at a time when a complete PD2 would cost over ¬£5,000. Alexander took the running units from its 17 OPS2s in 1961 and fitted them into new Titan PD3 frames, then fitted units from scrapped PS1s into the former OPS2s. When fitted with new Alexander bodies the recycled double-deckers could only be distinguished from similar new deliveries in that they retained the traditional radiator and bonnet from the Tigers whilst the new buses had full- width bonnets. Ulster Transport Authority also rebodied many of its Tigers in the 1950s, using new Leyland Titan PD2 chassis frames and Metro-Cammell bodyframes completed at UTA's Belfast coachworks. CI√â stripped a late batch of OPS3s of their units and purchased new Titan PD3 frames and St Helens Style glassfibre bonnets, and had the vehicles assembled in 1961-62 complete with Park Royal body frames by a company called Commercial Road Vehicles who were renting part of the former Great Northern Railway (Ireland) central works in Dundalk. These 'R900' Titans were CI√â's last front-engine double-deckers, again the R series had started in 1934 with Dublin United Transport. The last two front-engined Tigers known to have been rebodied were two completed by Vernon Priaulx, then coachbuilder for Guernseybus in 1991/2. After the success of open top RT-type AEC Regent III on tourist routes on Guernsey two former Jersey Motor Transport Tiger PS1s were purchased. Their Reading of Portsmouth bodies were too decayed to be restored so the first Tiger was rebodied as a single-deck open topper (Southport Corporation had used Ribble PS2s as such in the 1960s) and the second became a 35-seat coach with full-length sunshine roof. Both went to Mac Tours of Edinburgh after Guernseybus closed and passed to the Ensignbus preserved fleet, although the open topper is to operate a tourist service back on Jersey in 2012. On repatriation to Jersey it was registered J1942.  Preservation  There are many PS-type Tigers in preservation, carrying a wide variety of coachwork, some double-deck. Being smaller and more mechanically basic than a more modern bus they are perhaps easier to look after, but bodywork can often be very fragile.  In popular culture  Both during their operational life and later Tigers crop up often on screen, one also found itself a major player in Jasper Fforde's 2007 comic novel First Among Sequels.

Department of Virginia to January 1866. The 8th Maine Infantry mustered out of service January 18, 1866. Detailed History This regiment made up of companies from different parts of the state, and was organized at Augusta, Sept. 7, 1861, to serve three years. It entered the service with 770 enlisted men, and in bravery and efficiency was excelled by few, if any regiments in the service. It left the state Sept. 10, for Hempstead, Long Island, N. Y., and subsequently for Fortress Monroe, Va., where it formed a part of Gen. T. W. Sherman's expedition to Port Royal, S. C., which sailed on Oct. 29, and landed at Hilton Head Nov. 8, 1861. For several months the men were engaged in throwing up breastworks and building fortifications. On May 1, 1862, they moved to Tybee Island in the Savannah River, and took a prominent part in the attack on and capture of Fort Pulaski, one of the defenses of Savannah. From this time until the spring of 1864, the regiment was employed for the most part in doing guard duty at Hilton Head and Beaufort, S. C., and at Jacksonville, Fla. It suffered much sickness as the result of the exposures of the spring campaign in 1862, and from diseases contracted in a southern climate. In Nov., 1862, about 300 well drilled and disciplined recruits were sent to the regiment from Maine. In Nov., 1863, while at Beaufort, S. C., its ranks were again replenished by the addition of nearly 200 drafted men, who proved excellent soldiers. In March, 1864, 16 officers and 330 enlisted men, who had reenlisted for a term of three years, received a furlough of 35 days and returned to their homes. In April, 1864, the 8th was transferred to the Department of Virginia, and on May 4, moved to Bermuda Hundred, where it took part in all the active operations of the Army of the James. Sixty veterans, whose term of service had expired, returned to the state, and were mustered out of service on Sept. 15, 1864. The regiment was still large enough, however, to retain its organization as many men had reenlisted and it had received 570 recruits. Until the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, it was engaged in numerous skirmishes and arduous picket and guard duties, and took part in the following important engagements: Drewry's Bluff, losing 96 men, killed, wounded and prisoners; Cold Harbor, where it lost 79 men; the operations before Petersburg, losing 50 men; Chaffin's Farm; Fair Oaks, where it again lost heavily, Spring Hill; capture of Forts Gregg and Baldwin, Rice's Station and Appomattox Court House. After Lee's surrender, it was at Richmond until Aug., 1865, at Manchester until the following November, and at Fortress Monroe until Jan. 18, 1866, when the men were mustered out and proceeded to Augusta, Me., where they were paid and finally discharged. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 381 men during service; 6 officers and 128 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 4 officers and 243 enlisted men died of disease.

Early life Pyne was born in Bristol, England and taught himself to paint. He took part in the sketching activities of the Bristol School in the 1820s, and exhibited for the first time in Bristol in 1824. His style and subject matter, namely the atmospheric depiction of local landscapes and imaginary scenes, were those of Danby and the Bristol School, among whom he was one of the most able oil painters. Examples were Imaginary Scene (1828) and View of the Avon from Durdham Down (1829). In 1832, after producing some oil paintings of the Bristol Riots, he spent 6 weeks in France with his fellow Bristol School artist Edward Villiers Rippingille. Pyne also seems to have participated from 1832-33 in the revival of the Bristol School's sketching meetings. Later years alt=A few small figures are scattered along a track lined with tumbled masonry and trees, which leads steeply downwards towards a distant shore. A boat in the surf is making white smoke, while a larger cloud of black smoke issues from another boat further out. Across the water are high pink cliffs. William James M√ºller had been apprenticed to Pyne during 1827-29/30. However M√ºller did not remain much influenced by Pyne and the other Bristol School artists. Pyne himself did not long continue in the style of Danby's \\"poetical\\" landscapes. In the mid 1830s, probably in 1835, he moved to London where he developed his mature style. His landscapes now followed Turner in their colours and style of composition. Turner's influence can be seen for example in Clifton, Near Bristol, from the Avon (1837), which was exhibited at the Royal Academy. Pyne exhibited at the British Institution during 1833-1844 at the Royal West of England Academy in Bristol, and at the Royal Academy during 1836-41\\\\. He became Vice-President of the Society of British Artists. alt=A group of small figures in front of a tall tree which is silhouetted against the yellow glare of the sun, with a conical mountain in the distance. In 1846 he travelled to Germany, Switzerland and Italy. He often painted in the Lake District. The art dealership Thomas Agnew and Sons commissioned him to paint in the Lake District in 1848, and then in 1851 to make a three year tour of Italy, in which he was accompanied by the Bristol watercolourist William Evans. Pyne died on 29 July 1870 in London, leaving sons James Baker Pyne, a photographer, and Charles Pyne, an artist. Besides M√ºller, his pupils included George Arthur Fripp and James Astbury Hammersley.

It needs attention to ensure a realistic depiction of the three-dimensionality of viewed scenes and is a specific instance of the more general task of 3D rendering of objects in two-dimensional displays. Depth in stereograms A stereogram consists of a pair of two-dimensional frames, one for each eye. Common to both are the widths and heights of objects; their depth is encoded in the differences between right and left eye views. The geometric relationship between an object's third dimension and these position differences is presented below and depends on the location of the stereo-camera lenses and the observer's eyes. Other factors, however, contribute to the depth seen in a stereoscopic view and whether it corresponds to that in the actual object; the act of viewing a stereoscopic display often alters observers' three-dimensional perception.Westheimer, Gerald (2011). \\"Three-dimensional displays and stereo vision\\". Proc. Roy. Soc. B, 278, 2241-2248. . Stereoscopic reconstruction The right and left eyes' panels in a stereoscopic reconstruction are created by projection from the principal points of the twin recording camera. The geometrical situation is most clearly understood by analyzing how the screens are generated when a small cubical element of side length dx = dy = dz is photographed from a distance z with a twin camera whose lenses are a distance a apart. Geometry of screen view of a small cube at a distance z captured by a twin camera with separation a. Right and left eye images are shown superimposed. In the left eye panel of the stereogram the distance AB is the representation of the front face of the cube, in the right eye panel, there is in addition BC, the representation of the cube's depth, i.e., the intercept on the screen of the rays from the cameras‚Äô principal points to the back of the cube. This interval computes to the first order to dz*\\\\frac{a}{z}. (To simplify the account, the right and left screens are taken to be superimposed, as they would be in a 3D display with LCD goggles.) Hence the depth/width ratio of the cube‚Äôs view, as embodied in its representation on the viewing screen, is r = a√ódz/z√ódx = a/z since dx=dz and depends solely on the distance of the target from the twin lenses and their separation and remains constant with scale or magnification changes. The depth/width ratio of the actual object, of course, is 1.00. This stereogram with the cube, whose depth/width ratio had been captured with recording parameters ac and zc and embodied in the ratio BC/AB = rc=ac/zc, is now viewed by an observer with interocular separation ao at a distance zo. An overall scale change in BC/AB does not matter, but unless ro = rc, i.e., ao/zo = ac/zc. this no longer represents a cube but rather becomes, for this observer at this distance, a configuration for which R = rc/ro ...... (1) i.e., whose depth is R times that of a cube. Depth rendition defined A stereogram of intertwining rings. When fused by an observer, perceived depth increases with viewing distance. The stereoscopic depth rendition r is a measure of the flattening or expansion in depth for a display situation and is equal to the ratio of the angles of depth and width subtended at the eye in the stereogram reconstruction of a small cubical element. A value r > 1 says that what is seen has an expanded depth relative to the actual configuration. A numerical example will illustrate: a structure is photographed by a stereocamera with interlens separation ac = 25 cm from a distance of 1 m, zc = 100. Hence rc = ac/zc = 0.25 and on the screens the right and left representation of the cube's far edge will be separated by ¬º the distance of the width. This stereogram is now viewed from a distance of 39 cm (the magnification does not matter, only the ratio BC/AB has to have been conserved) by an observer with interocular distance 6.5 cm, i.e., ro = 6.5/39 = 0.167. According to equation (1) for this view the structure has a stereoscopic depth rendition given by R = rc/ro = 0.25/0.167 = 1.5, meaning that the observer is presented with the geometrical situation not of a cube but of a structure 1.5√ó as deep as it is wide. For this to become a cube ro needs to be 0.25 which occurs for an observation distance zo = 6.5/0.25 = 26 cm. This example illustrates that a given stereoscopic presentation for a given observer gains in depth/width ratio (expands in depth) with increasing observation distance. Observers, who can fuse the twin images of the rings by voluntarily changing their convergence, can verify this by moving away and towards the viewing screen. Homeomorphic and heteromorphic rendition Only when the recording and viewing situations have the same r value, i.e., only when ac/zc = ao/zo will the depth/width ratios of the actual structure and its view be identical. This particular condition has been termed homeomorphic by Moritz von Rohr and was contrasted by him with the heteromorphic one in which the r values of the stereoscopic and actual views differ.v. Rohr, Moritz (1907). Die Binokularen Instrumente. Berlin: Julius Springer. Non-veridical depth: other factors But homeomorphic rendition with geometrical parameters identical to the original does not assure that an observer's perception of depth in a stereoscopic image is the same as that in the actual three- dimensional structure. An observer judgment of the apparent disposition of objects in space depends on many factors other than the geometrical ones that pertain to the angles subtended by the components at the two eyes. This was well described in the classical study by Wallach and Zuckerman who pointed out that the depth in the view through binoculars seems foreshortened.Wallach, H. and Zuckerman, C. (1963). \\"The constancy of stereoscopic depth\\". Am. J. Psychol., 76, 404‚Äì412. Scenes appear flattened through field glasses, even non-prismatic ones without artificial extension of the base, which provide merely overall magnification and leave the r value unchanged. In contrast to the rules, laid out above, for calculating the geometrically defined stereoscopic depth rendition, the perceived depth involves factors ‚Äî context, previous experience ‚Äî that are individual and not specifiable with the same degree of generality. Chief among them is the distance at which the configuration appears to the viewer. This is by no means fixed: the subjective z is only vaguely related to the actual object distance, as is obvious in watching 3D film. Because apparent distance is the main source of judging object size (size or subjective constancy), observers' reports on the perceived depth/width ratio can deviate substantially from calculated values.Gogel, W.C. (1960). \\"Perceived frontal size as a determiner of perceived binocular depth\\". J. Psychol., 50, 119‚Äì131.Foley, J.M. (1968). \\"Depth, size and distance in stereoscopic vision\\". Percept Psychophys, 3, 265‚Äì274.Johnston, E.B. (1991). \\"Systematic distortions of shape from stereopsis\\". Vision Research, 31, 1351‚Äì1360. On the other hand, recent research confirms that the relative depths seen in three-dimensional configurations scale up more or less in proportion to the stereoscopic depth rendition arrived at within the purely geometrical framework.Westheimer, Gerald (2011). \\"Depth rendition of three-dimensional displays\\", J.

He played for the North Queensland Cowboys during the 1997 Super League season. He spent his third year in the top grade at a third club after moving to the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles for in 1998. The following year he moved to the Sydney Roosters where he would remain for the rest of his career. His performance for the club at fullback in their 2000 NRL Grand Final loss to the Brisbane Broncos drew glowing praise. The Roosters made the 2002 NRL Grand Final and Phillips played at fullback in the winning side with a shoulder injury that was later operated on in the off-season. Phillips' form at the back saw Roosters coach Ricky Stuart keep Brett Mullins on the wing (Mullins is a former team mate of both Stuart and Phillips at the Raiders in 1996 and was also the first choice fullback for the Australian test team (alongside Stuart who was the test ) on the 1994 Kangaroo tour). However he retired during the first half of the 2003 NRL season after failing to recover. Refereeing career At a Sydney Roosters function sometime after his retirement, Luke Phillips was still trying to decide what to in life after football. It was there that former Grand Final and State of Origin winning coach Phil Gould said to him \\"Why don't you have a go at refereeing? The NRL is looking for players who want to pick up a whistle\\". Phillips, looking for a way to stay involved in the game, decided to give it a go, though he initially believed he wouldn't enjoy it. After starting out in the Central Coast Division in 2007, Phillips was given a cadetship with the NRL in 2008 (alongside other former first grade players Henry Perenara and Paul Mellor). He then started officiating in the Under-20s National Youth Competition (NYC) in 2009. His first appearance in the NRL was as a touch judge in Round 26 of the 2009 NRL season. =NRL= After spending most of 2010 refereeing in the NSW Cup (reserve grade), Luke Phillips made his first grade debut as a referee on 21 August for a Round 24 match of the 2010 NRL season at AAMI Park in Melbourne as the Melbourne Storm defeated Cronulla 24-4. He then made a further three appearances in the 2011 NRL season while mostly officiating in the 2011 NSW Cup. He spent all of 2012 refereeing in the NSW Cup, though he has since become a regular first grade referee in the 2013 NRL season. Although he was yet to make his NRL debut as a referee at the time, Phillips was selected alongside Ashley Klein, Shayne Hayne and Gavin Badger to referee the inaugural NRL All Stars game at Skilled Park on the Gold Coast in 2010. Phillips juggles his time as a full-time NRL referee with running his own Pinball and Video game supply business.Ex-Grand Final Hero now a Referee References 1975 births Australian rugby league players Canberra Raiders players North Queensland Cowboys players Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Sydney Roosters players Rugby league fullbacks Australian rugby league referees National Rugby League referees Living people Rugby league players from the Australian Capital Territory ","title":"Luke Phillips"},{"id":"29005251","text":"Spring Glen is the name of several places in the United States of America. *Spring Glen, Hamden, a neighborhood in the town of Hamden, Connecticut *Spring Glen, New York, a hamlet *Spring Glen, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community *Spring Glen, Utah, a census-designated place *Spring Glen, Washington, an unincorporated community ","title":"Spring Glen"},{"id":"29005262","text":"Sophia Maria Westenholz (n√©e Elenore Sophia Maria Fritscher; 10 July 1759 - 4 October 1838) was a German composer, musician, singer and music educator.

At the behest of Duke Ludwig, she studied piano and singing with Konzertmeister Johann Wilhelm Hertel in Schwerin beginning at age ten. By the time she was sixteen, she was employed as a singer in the Mecklenburg-Schwerin court chapel at Ludwigslust. She became the second wife of the Kapellmeister Carl August Friedrich Westenholz in the summer of 1777; they had eight children together. By the 1780s, Westenholz received great acclaim in Berlin, Leipzig, Ludwigslust and Rostock, amassing a following including composer Ernst Wilhelm Wolf and Carl Friedrich Cramer. Wolf is quoted as saying ‚ÄúMrs. Westenholz's manner is that of the great Bach in Hamburg.‚Äù In a review of his six sonatas, which Wolf had dedicated to Sophie Westenholz, Cramer also praised the balance in the musical expression of her playing.

He is best known for his two years as Auburn University's starting quarterback and leader of the 1983 SEC Championship Tigers. Upon graduation Campbell held NCAA passing records and was named MVP of the 1982 Tangerine Bowl. Campbell founded Campbell Wealth Management, LLC, a wealth management and life insurance company. Early life Randy Campbell was born in North Carolina to James and Tommie Campbell. He has one younger brother, Norman Campbell. His father was transferred to Hartselle, Alabama when Campbell was in the second grade where he attending Hartselle Elementary School. He went to Morgan County High School, now known as Hartselle High School. Campbell was the starting quarterback for several years at Morgan County High School. As a senior Campbell was ranked the number one quarterback and considered the fourth best player overall in the state of Alabama. Campbell served as class president of Morgan County High School for three years and was ranked in the top 10 academically of his graduating class. He was offered many NCAA Division I-A athletic scholarships such as the University of Tennessee, the University of Mississippi, Vanderbilt University and Mississippi State University and decided on Auburn University. College years Campbell played under Coach Pat Dye as the starting quarterback during the 1982 and 1983 seasons. Other standouts on those teams were Bob Harris, David Jordan, Al Del Greco, Tommie Agee, Lionel \\"Little Train\\" James, John \\"Jay\\" Jacobs and Ben Thomas. The 1982 season is highlighted with the victory over state rival the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant after a nine-year losing streak. Campbell then led the Tigers to a victory over Boston College in the Tangerine Bowl. Campbell was named Most Valuable Player in that game where two future Heisman Trophy winners played as well; Vincent \\"Bo\\" Jackson (Auburn University) and Doug Flutie (Boston College). As Team Captain in 1983, Campbell led the Tigers to a consecutive victory over the Crimson Tide finishing the year 11-1. They were named the SEC Champions and bested the University of Michigan in the Nokia Sugar Bowl. Auburn was ranked #3 AP, UPI, National Champions ‚Äì New York Times. Campbell received the 1983 Birmingham Monday Morning Quarterback Club ‚Äì SEC Back of the Year and set an NCAA record for lowest interception ratio in a career 5 interceptions 300 attempts. He also received the Cliff Hare Award. Professional career Upon graduation Campbell moved to Atlanta to work for a sports marketing and management firm, Athletic Management Service, Inc. where he was primarily responsible for recruiting and managing professional athletes and coaches. Some of the individuals Campbell worked with included Coach Bobby Bowden of Florida State University, Dominique Wilkins of the University of Georgia and Atlanta Hawks and defensive great Ted Roof from Georgia Tech who now is the Defensive Coordinator at Campbell's alma mater. Campbell then moved to Florence, Alabama where he coached wide receivers and tight ends in football at the University of North Alabama (Lions) under Head Coach Bobby Wallace. Campbell was quickly moved to Quarterbacks Coach then became Offensive Coordinator. During his fourth and final season at University of North Alabama Campbell's last signed recruit was Ronald McKinnon from Elba, Alabama. McKinnon became the first and only defensive player ever to be awarded the Harlan Hill Award. McKinnon went on to receive the Rookie of the Year Award in the National Football League while playing for the Arizona Cardinals. In January 1992, Dye asked Campbell to replace former Heisman Trophy winner Coach Pat Sullivan as Quarterbacks Coach for the Auburn Tigers. Sullivan had recently resigned from Auburn to become the new Head Coach at Texas Christian University (Hornfrogs). Stan White and Patrick Nix were two of the players Campbell coached that season. Before the last game of that season, Dye announced his retirement. Campbell decided to leave coaching as well, move to Birmingham, Alabama and begin a career selling life insurance and in wealth management. He joined Pittman Financial, Inc. as a career agent in the New England Life Insurance Company system. After only 9 months in the new position Campbell was given a national recognition by New England as a member of the Rookie of the Year Team for sales performance. Entrepreneurship and philanthropy As an entrepreneur Campbell formed his own company Campbell Wealth Management, LLC, based in Birmingham, Alabama where he serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer. He has worked closely with Auburn University in the Charitable Planned Giving program helping raise millions of dollars which will benefit Auburn University in years to come.

After completion of his education, and his marriage, he worked as a draughtsman for the Co-op Gas Company in Thurlaston, Leicestershire, from 1910 until his enlistment in 1915.Franks, et al, pp. 43--;44. Military career From cadet he was appointed a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 February 1918, on the General List to serve in the Royal Flying Corps. He was confirmed in his rank as an observer officer on 27 May, by which time the Army's Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service had merged to form the Royal Air Force. By then Ralph was already serving as a gunner/observer in the rear seat of a Bristol F.2 Fighter in No. 20 Squadron, as on 9 May, flying with pilot Lieutenant David Smith, he had gained his first victory, shooting down in flames a Fokker Dr.I west of Lille. The next day, he was wounded in action; his pilot flew him back to base. He then went on to fly with a number of pilots. On 31 May, he and Lieutenant Leslie Capel destroyed an Albatros D.V north of Laventie. Then, flying with Lieutenant William Thomson, he destroyed a Pfalz D.III over Comines‚ÄìHouthem on 9 June, and drove down out of control a Fokker D.VII over Boezinge on 17 June, a victory shared with Captain Dennis Latimer & Lieutenant Tom Noel. On 26 June, for his fifth victory, which made him an ace, he drove down a Pfalz D.III over Armenti√®res with Lieutenant Paul Iaccaci.

It is affiliated to the Ulster Branch of the Irish Rugby Football Union. The club presently field a First XV in the Ulster Minor League East 1 Section, finishing runner up in the 2013/14 season. The squad train at Allen Park on a Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00pm. The club also include a Viking Minis section for children between the ages of 5-11, maintaining close links with local primary schools and in particular, Antrim Grammar School. Traditionally, the team wear blue and white with navy shorts and navy socks.  History  Back in the 1960s the town of Antrim suffered a population explosion from the extent of being situated on the main route between Belfast and the North West. A government paper known as the Butler report suggested that the new town should be able to support a rugby club. On the strength of this report, several local enthusiasts including Councillors Jack Allen and Jarvis Campbell got together and Antrim RFC was formed in the Summer of 1966. Jarvis Campbell became the first president and Jack Allen became the founder Chairman. To this day, 2 of the founder members (Neville Laverty and Dennis Manson) remain active with the club. Initially a 1st and 2nd XV were formed and played a season of friendlies and cup matches. The teams were formed from local players who left neighbouring clubs plus a large influx of schoolboys mainly from the Ballymena. After one season, the 1st XV and the 2nd XV entered the Ulster Junior and Intermediate leagues respectively. In 1970 a 3rd XV was formed and the club soon had a 4th XV come 1976. Conveniently in 1974, Antrim Grammar School was formed and the club were able to enjoy an influx of ex schoolboys and teachers ever since. After the 1st XV winning the league in 1980, the club were able to attract more players and field a 5th XV. Progress continued as the 3rds and 4ths gained successive promotions through the leagues and the 1sts won a further promotion in 1987. However successful the team were on the pitch, off it also came success. Until the early 1970s, the pitch was still a field beside the Antrim Borough Council offices on the Steeple Road with changing rooms being a converted cow shed. In 1971 the club acquired ground on the Randalstown Road and amalgamated with Antrim Hockey Club. To raise money to develop the pitches, a clubhouse was opened in the Antrim Castle Grounds which was the base of the Hockey section in 1972 and opened by none other than Willie John McBride. In 1979 the official move was made to the club's present home Allen Park, which was named after local Mayor, and the then Club President Jack Allen. The facilities included a floodlit training area, 4 grass rugby pitches, 2 grass hockey pitches and one all weather training pitch. Come 1986, the club extended the changing rooms and added a new club house which was opened by Sir Ewart Bell(President of the IRFU).  1st XV Honours  Gordon West cup 2001,2002 (First side to ever defend it and joint top most wins)Gordon West Cup History Junior League section 5 winners 1980 Ulster Towns Cup runners up 1989  The Reformation  In 1995 the Hockey Club severed their ties with the rugby team and moved to Muckamore Cricket Club. After becoming recognised as one of the most ambitious teams in the Qualifying league, Antrim RFC went on to win the Gordon West Memorial in 2001 at Ravenhill. A year later, the squad defended their title and brought the trophy back to Allen Park, remaining to this very day, the only team to defend it successfully. However, due to a lack of recruitment to a 2ndXV and a significant number of player retirements in 2006, the team unfortunately could not complete its fixtures post Christmas 2007 and did not field a rugby team for rest of the 2007 season. The players dispersed to play their rugby elsewhere. In the new season a group of older players and former schoolboys decided to start a team again in order to keep the team going on a social basis. In 2007 Antrim re-entered the Magners Minor Leagues and after finding their footing, went on to finish 3rd in 2009. The league was once again restructured & with the team holding their own and with player numbers increasing on a continuous basis, the playing squad formed their own sub committee and appointed a proper coach, found a new sponsor for the match kits and approached the Ulster Branch with a proposal to rejoin the Kukri Qualifying Section. The application was accepted and the club turned over a new leaf and fielded their first team within the league in 4 years against Letterkenny RFC. With only one team, the club had struggled in the league and opted to field a team in the Minors once again to allow the youngsters to learn their trade. In 2013 the club, worked closely with Ulster Rugby and the IRFU to develop a coaching initiative which resulted in the club re- establishing the minis section once again. Working closely within the local primary schools and youth clubs, the club developed the Antrim Viking Minis brand. This was to tie in with the local history of the area and give the children something to belong to. The Viking Minis were able to field their first competitive team in almost 10 years and make their debut in the half time of the Heineken Cup game of Ulster vs Saracens in the reopening of the newly refurbished Ravenhill stadium.

Founded in Kenya in 1946, business activities are focused on six principal product sectors - water pumps, boreholes, swimming pools, water treatment, generators, solar energy equipment and irrigation. The group operates through a network of national branches as well as regional subsidiaries in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and a partnership in Ethiopia.  History  The Davis & Shirtliff Group was founded in 1946 as a partnership between EC 'Eddie' Davis and FR 'Dick' Shirtliff after Dick Shirtliff purchased 50% of RH Paige & Co., a small plumbing and water engineering firm founded in 1926 and which was bought into by Eddie Davis in 1945. In 1947, it became a founding member of the Kenya Association of Building and Civil Engineering Contractors (KABCEC) and, in 1955, after purchasing two new plots of land and constructing new offices and workshops, moved its operations to its new site. In 1965 it took delivery of the first consignment of pumps from Grundfos in Denmark and, in 1968, imported a consignment of Davey pumps from Australia. In 1982 the range of Grundfos products was expanded to include solar pumps. 1985 saw the appointment of Butech Limited as the Mombasa distributor of their products and the commencement of fibreglass filter production. In 1992, the group & Shirtliff purchased a 20% shareholding in Butech Limited; which was finally bought out in 2000, becoming the Mombasa Branch of Davis & Shirtliff. In 1993 they imported their first Linz pumps from Pedrollo, Italy. In 1995 they introduced the 'Pump Centre' and the establishment of a countrywide range of dealers. 1995 also saw the opening of a Branch in Eldoret. Subsidiaries opened in Kampala and Dar-es-Salaam in 1996 and 1998 respectively. The business has recently expanded. Throughout the first decade of the millennium, Davis & Shirtliff opens branches and subsidiaries in Lusaka; Kigali; Nakuru and Arusha; Zanzibar and Kitwe; Malindi; Addis Ababa, Mwanza and Diani; and, Juba in, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 respectively, thereby expanding the distribution of its products and its consumer base. In 2001, Davis & Shirtliff was appointed the regional distributor for Pedrollo Pumps. In 2003, the firm's solar division was established as a regional distributor for Shell Solar. Also, in 2004, it became a Certikin distributor and, in 2005, was appointed as a Lister Petter engine generator distributor for the region.  Community work  The company assists needy institutions to obtain water supplies. Funding for community activities is largely provided through an annual contribution from the company and its staff.

The church is located in a residential area west of downtown Sioux City, Iowa, United States. The parish buildings form a nationally recognized historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as St. Boniface Historic District. At the time of its nomination it contained three resources, all of them contributing buildings. with History In December 1885 a meeting was held by German Catholics in Sioux City to form a new parish. It was the second parish in the city. They purchased two lots on the corner of West Fifth and Main Streets for $1,500. The Rev. John A Gerleman was appointed the parish's first pastor on Christmas Eve 1886. A small frame church was built and the first Mass in the church was celebrated on July 17, 1887. The parish school opened the same year with Franciscan Sisters from Dubuque, Iowa teaching in the school. The parish was started when Sioux City was still in the Diocese of Dubuque. It became a parish in the Sioux City diocese when it was formed in 1902. In 1906 Franciscan Friars from the Sacred Heart Province started serving the parish. That year the Rev. Seraphin Lampe, OFM, became the pastor that year and plans were made for a new church. A new church and rectory were built on West Fifth Street between Omaha and Cook Streets. Brother Leonard Darschield, OFM, designed the new church in the Romanesque Revival style. The new church was dedicated by Bishop Philip Garrigan on September 4, 1911. That same a year a new convent for the sisters was built. It was also designed by Brother Leonard and looked similar to the church and rectory. It was torn down in 1993 to add parking spaces after a fire gutted its interior. The present school building and heating plant were designed by prominent Sioux City architect William LaBarthe Steele, and completed in 1924. The Sisters of the Living Word started staffing the school in 1975. In 1986 the Franciscan Friars left the parish and were replaced by priests from the diocese. The schools from St. Boniface, St. Joseph, and the Cathedral of the Epiphany consolidated in 1987 to form Holy Family School. Subsequently, the three parishes have been clustered as well. Weekend Masses are celebrated in St Boniface Church in English and Spanish.

At the time it was built, St. Boniface Church was the tallest structure in Sioux City. The exterior is clad with brick from Buffalo, New York and the trim is in Bedford limestone. The building features a symmetrical facade of three bays, four roof dormers each on the north and south elevations, and a rounded apse on the east elevation. The 66 stained glass windows in the church include round-arch widows and a rose window. They were produced in Munich, Germany in 1910. The interior features a rib vaulted ceiling that rises above the floor. The original wood altars were carved by a Franciscan brother. Statues of St. Boniface and St. Patrick are located on the high altar, while statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph are on the side altars. A social hall is located in the basement. The attached rectory is a 2¬Ω-story front gable residence that features the same detailing and materials as the church. The two-story brick school building was designed to reflect the style of the church. It features a projecting center bay on its north elevation that includes the main entrance. It has a flat roof. The building has been altered over the years. The simple, two-story brick power plant was built at the same time as the school. It is located directly behind the school building and it includes a tall concrete smokestack.

(March 20, 1842 ‚Äì January 21, 1922) was a noted artist and painter of landscapes from Long Island, New York. The American poet Bayard Taylor (1825‚Äì1878) called him, \\"The artistic discoverer of the little continent of Long Island.\\"Humes & Mosback, Charles Henry Miller 1842-1922 - Exhibition - Landscape & Portraiture - Collection of Art Objects & Rare Books - by Charles Henry Miller, pamphlet, c. 1922.  Biography  Miller was educated at Mount Washington Collegiate Institute, and graduated in medicine at the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1863 or 1864, receiving his diploma from the hand of William Cullen Bryant, then President of that institution. He then offered his services to our Government; but his homoeopathic faith proving a barrier, and meeting Captain Hutchinson of the once famous \\"Black Ball\\" line of packets, he accepted from him the position of surgeon on his ship, the Harvest Queen, sailing from New York to Liverpool. This vessel, though never renowned for fast voyages, as were so many of her sister clippers, was a noted emigrant ship ... In 1864, when our artist made his first and last voyage in her, common sailors were getting ninety dollars for the trip, and bounty jumping was frequently practised. Many desperadoes, attracted by the high rate of wages, shipped as foremast hands, and stirring scenes were enacted. A mutiny, which was luckily quelled without loss of life, broke out twice on the Harvest Queen; and Mr. Miller, among his other reminiscences of an eventful voyage, recalls a day when he was ranged beside the captain on the quarter-deck, revolver in hand, ready to aid in overcoming the mutineers ... When the ship reached New York on her return trip, two of the sailors were drowned in an attempt to escape from her; and the sketches made by Mr. Miller on board include one of a luckless and forlorn-looking seaman, standing at the wheel, who had jumped overboard, but was captured and severely beaten. While the Harvest Queen was lying in the Liverpool docks, Miller took a flying trip to London, Scotland, and France, making numerous sketches. When he reached home again, his love of art, freshly kindled by the sight of some of the great art galleries of Europe, and the wonderful ocean scenes which he had attempted to draw on the voyage, proved itself too strong to be overcome. He abandoned medicine, and returned to the practice of art in New York. Before his graduation, Miller had occasionally painted pictures. In 1860, at the age of eighteen, he had exhibited The Challenge Accepted at the National Academy of Design, in New York City. Miller lived in Queens at the summer estate, Queenslawn, originally purchased by his parents, Jacob (1803‚Äì1874) and Jane Taylor Miller (1806‚Äì1895). He went abroad again in 1867, spending three years as a pupil in the Bavarian Royal Academy at Munich under the instruction of Adolf Lier. =Career= After the death of his father in 1874, who was a wealthy architect and builder, Miller received a large inheritance that allowed him to paint as an independent artist for the remainder of his long life. He worked seriously and exhibited regularly, including at international exhibitions. The majority of his oil paintings depict Long Island subjects, especially those in and around Queens Village. Fed up with the development of the eastern part of Queens (present-day Nassau County), he began to spend part of his summers in East Marion, Long Island, c. 1910. Here he spent his time sketching and painting the surrounding areas. In 1885 he published The Philosophy of Art in America, using the pseudonym Carl De Muldor (he was descended from the De Muldor family). He served as president of the New York Art Club in 1879 and of the American Committee at the Munich International Exposition in 1883.

She represented his widow, Barbara \\"Basia\\" Piasecka Johnson, while the will was contested by his children; The Washington Post described her relationship to her client as \\"a contemporary, traveling companion and close personal friend whose recompense for loyalty to and support of Basia was the extraordinary compensation.\\" Zagat maintained that \\"she acted according to Seward's instructions\\" and the suit was settled out of court.\\"Nina Zagat and a $500 Million Battle of Wills\\", by Paula Span, The Washington Post, March 13, 1986. Retrieved June 12, 2019. Both were employed in Paris ‚Äî he at office of the Hughes Hubbard law firm, and she with Shearman & Sterling. While there, they started compiling their own list of Parisian restaurants, of what they liked and didn't like, and conceived the idea for a new type of restaurant ratings guide. Zagat Survey When the Zagats returned to New York, they solicited the opinions of friends about New York restaurants; the resulting compilation eventually became Zagat. They published their first guide in 1982, for New York City, selling 7,500 copies in local bookstores. Two years later, when selling 40,000 copies per year; they each quit their jobs as corporate lawyers to pursue the enterprise full-time. One reviewer described the methodology: \\"The philosophy behind the Zagat Survey is that instead of one lengthy critical review of a restaurant, the eating public is better served by a rating based on hundreds of responses. By tabulating the responses to detailed surveys, the Zagat Survey rates restaurants on a 30-point scale in the categories of food, d√©cor, service and cost. It also provides price estimates and a pithy, paragraph-sized description.\\" The company expanded to include other cities and market segments such as hotels, stores and clubs; in early 2008, the couple tried to sell the company for $200 million, but then withdrew the sale when they could not find prospective buyers at that price. One reviewer wrote: \\"The Zagat Survey was once the sine qua non of restaurant guidebooks. Aside from a review in the paper, the survey's 30-point scale for food, service, and d√©cor‚Äîand its quirky comments submitted by readers‚Äîwas pretty much all that mattered to restaurateurs. While the book's ratings are still highly influential‚Äîand while the company remains highly profitable‚Äîthe guide is no longer the indispensable possession it once was and it's clear that its influence has waned in recent years.\\" The relative decline was attributed to the company's \\"online strategy\\" which made the guide only available to paying subscribers. In September 2011, the company was acquired by Google for a reported $151 million. Personal life The Jewish-American couple have two sons, Ted and John, and live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York. =Stabbing incident= On November 15, 1990, Tim Zagat was watching Dances With Wolves at a Loews movie theater in New York City. An \\"apparently deranged\\" man, seated in the same row, made loud, obscene comments to others before the movie began. During the film, the man stabbed Zagat until an anonymous moviegoer pulled the attacker off of Zagat. The attacker fled out a side exit but police apprehended the suspect a few days later. Zagat received superficial wounds and was taken to Roosevelt Hospital.

Their musical style is a combination of Arabic elements, cabaret elements and hardcore elements and, occasionally, what is called \\"Circus-Core\\". To date, the band has released two studio albums on the indie record label \\"Earsay\\". Midnight Peacocks has provided opening acts in Israel for Firewater, Mike Patton and Dub Trio. History =Formation and It's a Brutal Machine (2004-2006)= Soon after the Plastic Peacocks broke up, two of the former bandmates, Eitan (bass & vocals) and Hagai (drums) decided to stick together, collaborate with Matan Ergas (guitar & vocals) and form the Midnight Peacocks. The new band immediately flew to Germany to record the group's first album It's a Brutal Machine. The album was released in 2006, with such songs from the album as: \\"Brutal Machine\\", \\"Indian Sun\\", \\"Island of the Sun\\" and \\"Ganja to the Chairman\\". =Shalosh (2006-2008)= In the end of 2006, Matan decided to leave the group to focus on his work with punk rock band Got No Shame, and the guitarist position was taken over by Ron Bunker (ex-member of Squid). In 2007, the group released its second studio album Shalosh (from the Hebrew word for \\"Three\\"). The album is kind of a concept album, as it is divided into 3 parts - the \\"Circus core\\" part, the oriental part and the experimental part. Notable songs from the album were: \\"Die\\", \\"Pussycat\\" and \\"Inside Outside\\". With its release, the band officially conquered the Israeli indie scene, providing in 2007 a support to Mike Patton in his solo show in Israel, and in 2008 to Dub Trio and Firewater. =Future (2009-present)= Since then, the band has been in almost continuous performance nearly everywhere in Israel; and also abroad, mostly around Europe. They made their first North American appearance at the SXSW Festival 2009 in Austin, Texas in 2009. Further Information Despite the fact that the band is considered a power trio, it is actually an ensemble of up to 12 musicians and performers: including, darbuka players, violin players, a saxophone player and even a belly dancer.

Norwich Pharmacal Co brought proceedings against the Excise Commissioners to force the disclosure of information which would identify the importer of the chemical, and therefore those who infringed the patent. The House of Lords held that where an innocent third party had information relating to unlawful conduct, a court could compel them to assist the person suffering damage by giving them that information. The case established the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction and disclosure orders against innocent third parties are now known as Norwich Pharmacal orders in the UK.  The case  The case was brought by Norwich Pharmacal Co. and the exclusive licensee of a patent for an antibacterial called furazolidone. Between 1960 and 1970 unlicensed shipments of the chemical were imported into Britain, therefore Norwich Pharmacal Co. knew that its patent was infringed but was unable to identify the importers. The Commissioners for Customs & Excise held information that would identify the importers, but would not disclose this, claiming that they had no authority to give such information. Norwich Pharmacal Co. brought proceedings against the Excise Commissioners, to force the Commissioners to disclose the names of the importers, which were the Intended Defendants. In Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] the House of Lords held that where an innocent third party has information relating to unlawful conduct, a court could compel them to assist the person suffering damage by giving them that information. The judgement is based on the 19th Century procedure known as the bill of discovery. Lord Reid summarised what became known as the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction as follows:  Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction  The 1974 House of Lords ruling in Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners established what is known as the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction, which allows UK courts to grant disclosure orders, known as Norwich Pharmacal orders, against innocent third parties which have been mixed up in wrongdoing. By identifying individuals the documents and information sought are disclosed in order to assist the applicant for such an order in bringing legal proceedings against individuals who are believed to have wronged the applicant. While first developed in relation to intellectual property, such as patents, Norwich Pharmacal orders are now granted in relation to other torts, as well as defamation and breach of contract, and alleged criminal offences. More recently Norwich Pharmacal orders are used against internet hosting services and internet service providers to identify users which have allegedly engaged in wrongdoing.

The movement was political in nature but not antipsychiatric in the sense in which this term is used in the Anglo-Saxon world. Democratic Psychiatry called for radical changes in the practice and theory of psychiatry and strongly attacked the way society managed mental illness. The movement was essential in the birth of the reform law of 1978.  Organizing committee  Democratic Psychiatry was created by a group of left- orientated psychiatrists, sociologists and social workers under direction of Franco Basaglia who was its figurehead. An organizing committee, which constituted in Bologna the first nucleus group called Democratic Psychiatry, consisted of Franca Basaglia, Franco Basaglia, Domenico Casagrande, Franco di Cecco, Tullio Fragiacomo, Vieri Marzi, Gian Franco Minguzzi, Piera Piatti, Agostino Pirella, Michele Risso, Lucio Schittar, Antonio Slavich.  History  In 1977, Democratic Psychiatry helped the Radical Party, a political organization principally concerned with the human rights defense, to collect together three-quarter of a million signatories to a petition to improve the mental health law and thus to prohibit hospitalization to psychiatric hospitals. According to Italian law this petition could have resulted in a national referendum on the issue. To avoid a referendum which could have forced the government to resign, the government passed Law 180 in May 1978 and thus initiated the dismantling of the psychiatric hospitals.  Directive committee  The 2010 National Congress of Democratic Psychiatry in Rome elected the new directive committee consisted of national secretary Emilio Lupo, national president Luigi Attenasio, honorary president Agostino Pirella, national treasurer Maurizio Caiazzo.  Approach  Basaglia and his followers deemed that psychiatry was used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment. The ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups. This approach was nonmedical and pointed out the role of mental hospitals in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems. According to A. Giannelli, at least in the beginning Democratic Psychiatry used phenomenological and existential ideas as its ideological and cultural reference point. However, according to P. Fusar-Poli with coauthors, Democratic Psychiatry was culturally grounded on Gramsci‚Äôs theory of ‚Äúrevolutionary reform‚Äù and Foucault‚Äôs critique of the ‚Äúmedical model‚Äù.  Objectives  The objectives of the association were (and still are) to pool professional initiatives and energies in any part of society which are aimed at closing mental hospitals and restoring the rights of psychiatric patients.  Programme  The programme of Democratic Psychiatry stated in Bologna on the 8 of October 1973 included the following proposals: # To continue to fight against exclusion, by analysing and rejecting its sources in the social structure (the social relations of production) and in the superstructures (norms and values) of our society. # To continue the struggle against the ‚Äúasylum‚Äù as the place where exclusion finds its most obvious and violent expression, as well as the practical means of reproducing the mechanisms of social marginalization. # To underline the dangers of reproducing segregating institutional structures, even in the mental health services created outside the hospital. # To make explicit, in a practical way, the link between acting in the specific psychiatric field and the more general problem of medical care, by demanding a unified action (beyond the division of labour and skills) which in the specific struggle for the promotion of mental health involves us in the broadest possible struggle for a concrete and necessary health reform based on, and expressing, a new social logic.

Stevens, EdD, MS, RN, ANEF, FAAN). The ISRN's goal is to fill a national gap in improvement science through a sustained research network for testing system-focused improvement strategies in healthcare. To anchor its inter-professional focus, the ISRN is part of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science (NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award) at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and is housed in the UTHSCSA School of Nursing. The ISRN provides a national laboratory for investigators from across broad geographical range to study improvement, healthcare delivery systems, dissemination, implementation, translation, safety, and patient outcomes. The ISRN infrastructure supports virtual collaboration in the conduct of network studies through direct engagement of study partners and sites, network study principal investigators, and centralized support. Built upon lessons learned from practice-based research networks (PBRNs), the ISRN is registered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as an active PBRN. Improvement science While \\"improvement science\\" is an emerging field, it shares common aspects with other areas of research such as implementation science, translational science, healthcare delivery science, and knowledge translation. These fields are similar in their focus on transforming what is learned from research into common practice to improve care processes and outcomes. \\"Improvement science\\" is proposed as the most inclusive term in this list and is proposed as a specialty within health services research. Need for improvement science taxonomy Because improvement science is a new scientific field, a common vocabulary is emerging. The influence of improvement science will be accelerated by the ability to measure outcomes and index knowledge; this is not possible without a specific taxonomy reflective upon, of the science itself. An improvement science taxonomy will provide a way for subject matter experts to develop, reflect upon, characterize, and examine relationships among the components that comprise improvement science as a whole, rather than individual parts. The goal is for users to have the ability to access improvement science knowledge and resources by using a consistent set of terms for organizing, retrieving, and delivering information for their own improvement purposes. The ISRN framework and the Stevens Star Model of Knowledge Transformation (Stevens, 2015) are reflected in an international effort to create common terminology of organizational interventions for implementing best evidence-based practices into health practices, systems and policies. To date, this effort resulted in development of a simplified model of interventions to promote and integrate evidence into health practices, systems, and policies (Colquhoun, et al., 2013) and a review of classification schemes for these interventions (Lokker, C., et al., 2015). Research priorities The Improvement Science Research Network established national stakeholder consensus on research priorities that distinguish it from other practice-based research networks (Stevens & Ovretveit, 2013). These priorities highlight the most important and urgent gaps in improvement knowledge as identified by clinical and academic scholars, leaders, and change agents across major healthcare disciplines. The research priorities guide decisions about the direction of ISRN discovery and dissemination efforts toward ISRN- sponsored knowledge in each of the following domains of improvement science: # Coordination and Transitions of Care ‚Äì this category emphasizes strategies for improvement to care processes in specific clinical conditions. At this time, care coordination and transitions of care are the key clinical focus. Examples of Research Issues: Team performance, medication reconciliation, discharge for prevention of early readmission, patient centered care, measurement of targeted outcomes. # High Performing Clinical Systems and Microsystems Approaches to Improvement ‚Äì this category emphasizes structure and process in clinical care and healthcare as complex adaptive systems. Examples of Research Issues: Frontline provider engagement, factors related to uptake, adoption and implementation, sustaining improvements and improvement processes. # Evidence- Based Quality Improvement and Best Practice ‚Äì this category emphasizes closing the gap between knowledge and practice through transforming knowledge and designating and implementing best practices. Examples of Research Issues: Develop and critically appraise clinical practice guidelines, adoption and spread of best practices, customization of best practices, institutional elements in adoption, defining best practice in absence of evidence, consumers in EBP, technology-based integration. # Learning Organizations and Culture of Quality and Safety ‚Äì this category emphasizes human factors and other aspects of a system related to organizational culture and commitment to quality and safety. Examples of Research Issues: Unit based nursing quality teams, protecting strategy from culture, engendering values and beliefs for culture of patient safety. Governance The ISRN is affiliated with the PBRN Resource Center of the Institute for Integration of Medicine and Science, University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. Through this alignment, ISRN addresses \\"Translational Science 3\\" (T3) phases of moving knowledge into practice. The interprofessional ISRN is a membership organization advised by the ISRN Steering Council. The Steering Council is composed of twelve healthcare experts, leaders, and stakeholders from both private and public agencies and facilities. Steering Council members represent a variety of backgrounds and contribute knowledge and guidance in areas such as patient safety, improvement and implementation research methods, clinical and organizational excellence criteria, systems engineering, healthcare informatics, quality measures, and team performance. The collective expertise of this multidisciplinary group reflects advanced knowledge of healthcare improvement science and aligns the ISRN's research and activities with stakeholder priorities. ISRN activities are supported by a coordinating team housed in the School of Nursing at the School of Nursing of the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. Events =Web events= The Improvement Science Research Network Web Event series expands capacity for conducting improvement studies through discussions of issues in the field of improvement science, provides updates regarding the ISRN activities, introduces new tools and research paradigms, and sets the stage for input regarding new directions for research. The first session of the web event series, \\"The Way Forward: An Introduction to Improvement Science\\", was held in June 2010. Presented by Jack Needleman, PhD, FAAN, and Kathleen R. Stevens, EdD, MS, RN, ANEF, FAAN, this introductory session showcased the activities of the ISRN as a catalyst for change. The discussion included definition of improvement science, exploration of the overlapping paradigms of improvement science, translational science, and implementation science and explanation of the need and context for improvement research and a discussion of improvement science research methods, study opportunities, and ISRN research results. Furthermore, the discussion enumerated the challenges facing improvement science and health care improvement in general, including a lack of evidence- based research methodologies; limited facility access to national improvement science experts; need for the on-site training in research methodologies; and lack of adequate collegial and technological infrastructure to support a national agenda of improvement science research priorities. The event showcased solutions available to meet these challenges, including the ISRN. Recordings are accessible on the ISRN website. Membership Membership in the ISRN is open to all who are healthcare researchers, academic and clinical scientists, clinicians, clinical leaders, administrators, and those with a specific interest in patient safety and improvement research.

It was first given at the Aldwych Theatre, London, the third in the series of twelve Aldwych farces presented by the actor-manager Tom Walls at the theatre between 1923 and 1933. Several of the actors formed a regular core cast for the Aldwych farces. The play depicts the complications that ensue when a young woman, dressed in pyjamas, seeks refuge from her bullying stepfather at a country house in the middle of the night. The play was first performed in 1926 at the Aldwych Theatre in London, the third of the Aldwych farces,Trussler, p. 281 and ran for 409 performances.\\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 In 1930 Walls directed a filmed version of the play, with most of the same performers, and the piece has been revived and adapted as a musical. Background The actor- manager Tom Walls, initially together with Leslie Henson, produced the series of Aldwych farces, nearly all written by Ben Travers, starring Walls and his co-star Ralph Lynn, who specialised in playing \\"silly ass\\" characters. Walls assembled a regular company of actors to fill the supporting roles. For the first few productions, the company included Robertson Hare, as a figure of put-upon respectability; Mary Brough in eccentric old lady roles; Ethel Coleridge as the severe voice of authority, Winifred Shotter as the sprightly young female lead; and the saturnine Gordon James.Trussler, p. 278 Walls and his team had already enjoyed two substantial hits at the Aldwych, with It Pays to Advertise (1923), which had run for 598 performances, and A Cuckoo in the Nest (1925, 376 performances). Rookery Nook, Travers's second playscript for the company, was based on a farcical novel he had published three years earlier.\\"John Lane, The Bodley Head Ltd\\", The Times, 22 June 1923, p. 8 Original cast *Gertrude Twine ‚Äì Ethel Coleridge *Mrs Leverett ‚Äì Mary Brough *Harold Twine ‚Äì Robertson Hare *Clive Popkiss ‚Äì Tom Walls *Gerald Popkiss ‚Äì Ralph Lynn *Rhoda Marley ‚Äì Winifred Shotter *Putz ‚Äì Griffith Humphreys *Admiral Juddy ‚Äì Gordon James *Poppy Dickey ‚Äì Ena Mason *Clara Popkiss ‚Äì Stella Bonheur *Mrs Possett ‚Äì Vera Gerald\\"Aldwych Theatre ‚Äì Rookery Nook\\", The Times, 1 July 1926, p. 14 Synopsis The action takes place on a summer night in the lounge-hall of \\"Rookery Nook\\", a house at Chumpton-on-Sea, Somerset. =Act I= The formidable Gertrude Twine has arranged for her newly-wed sister, Clara Popkiss, and husband Gerald Popkiss, to stay at Rookery Nook after their honeymoon. Gertrude and her henpecked husband Harold live nearby. Clive Popkiss, Gerald's cousin, is staying with the Twines, and when Gerald arrives Clive is at Rookery Nook to greet him. Except for a larger-than-life daily charwoman, Mrs Leverett, Gerald is temporarily on his own at Rookery Nook, Clara having gone to visit her mother. After Clive leaves, Gerald's solitude is interrupted by the incursion of a young woman, barefoot, wet, and wearing only pyjamas. She is Rhoda Marley, who lives nearby with her ferocious Prussian stepfather, Putz. He has thrown her out of his house for some trivial offence. Gerald lends her a pair of dry pyjamas and a dressing gown. She has nowhere else to go, and the gallant Gerald agrees to give her refuge at Rookery Nook. Putz comes to the house with his dog, looking for Rhoda, but, thwarted, he departs in a loud rage. Gerald cedes the main bedroom to Rhoda. He is extremely uneasy and fears that, despite the purity of his intentions, there will be a scandal. The worldly Clive discovers the situation and gives Gerald moral support. Gertrude and Harold Twine enter, and Rhoda hides in the kitchen. Harold finds her there and is hastily sworn to secrecy by Clive and Gerald, though he is terrified that Gertrude will discover that he has deceived her. Clive assures him that he will explain everything in the morning. =Act II= The following day, Harold turns up to hear Clive's explanation. Unknown to the men, Mrs Leverett and Gertrude Twine also arrive; they see Rhoda coming out of Gerald's bedroom and are in haste to tell Clara about it. Clive and Gerald bully Harold into going to fetch some clothes for Rhoda so that she can leave the house and escape to London to stay with friends. While Harold is away on this errand, a further intruder, Admiral Juddy, arrives at Rookery Nook demanding to know why Harold has failed to turn up as agreed for a round of golf. Clive, who has taken strongly to Rhoda, offers to drive her to London. Harold returns, having failed to secure any of Rhoda's own clothes from Putz's house: Putz set the dog on him, and he fled. Instead, Harold has brought some of his wife's clothes, but Putz, wise to the scheme to rescue Rhoda, takes them from him. =Act III= Admiral Juddy has heard from Harold that Rhoda is hiding at Rookery Nook. He calls to offer her refuge at his house, but the lack of respectable daytime clothes for her to appear in remains an unsolved problem. Poppy Dickey, a lively young woman from the village, calls, collecting for charity. Rhoda persuades her to lend her the clothes she is wearing, and thus clad Rhoda escapes. Alerted by her meddling sister Gertrude, Clara arrives. She confronts Gerald, whose answer is to throw open the bedroom door, trusting that Clara will see that Rhoda is an innocent damsel in distress. Instead Clara finds Poppy, in her underwear. Gerald attempts to explain about the lunatic Putz and his conduct to Rhoda, but this line falls flat when Putz himself appears, and, to thwart Gerald and Clive's plans, behaves with exaggerated restraint and courtesy. Gerald is floundering until Rhoda shows up to thank him for his help, along with Clive, who accuses Mrs Leverett of spreading malicious rumour about Rhoda. Mrs Leverett protests that it was Gertrude who started the rumour that Rhoda was not Putz's stepdaughter but his mistress. Putz, hearing their scandalous accusation, flies into a towering rage, substantiating Gerald's explanation. Gerald and Clara are reconciled and Clive happily pairs off with Rhoda. Critical reception The Times praised the cast and concluded: \\"With them, and with the whole rippling foolery, the audience with good reason was delighted. The Observer thought the piece \\"an excellent farce ‚Ä¶ played to perfection\\", and warned of the need for physical endurance to cope with a whole evening of such laughter as the play provoked.\\"Aldwych ‚Äì Rookery Nook\\", The Observer, 4 July 1926, p. 15 When the piece was revived in 1979, Michael Billington praised its \\"wonderful combination of panic and innocence\\".Billington, Michael. \\"Rookery Nook\\", The Guardian, 21 November 1979, p. 11 In 2005, Charles Spencer wrote in The Daily Telegraph, \\"Beneath the laughter, Rookery Nook is blessed with a robust tolerance, celebrating sexual desire and human frailty, even as it deplores those gossips addicted to 'vile scandals, venomous libels, and dirty little tattling tea parties'.

Built in neo-gothic style in the middle of the 19th century, it was adopted as 'cathedral' church when Pune (then Poona) was made diocese (1886), of which it is still the main church. It also has the highest number of parishioners of the Pune diocese. History The cathedral was built in 1850 mainly to cater the Irish Catholic soldiers and others settled in Wanwadi and nearby areas. Earlier, mass was celebrated for the troops, who were mainly Irish and other Catholics in a single-room chapel at the end of Right Flank Lines in Wanwadi. Bishop Anastasius Hartmann OFM Cap., the Apostolic Vicar of Bombay and Poona, wanted to have a better place of worship, and so he co-opted Fr. James Carry, an Irish diocesan priest from the Madras Mission, as a chaplain in Poona in 1849. Fr. Carry immediately drew up plans to erect a new chapel. At the request of the bishop, the government allotted land. The chapel was built with contributions from people and from the soldiers, who contributed a month's salary. On 8 December 1850, the first mass was celebrated in the new chapel, which is now St. Patrick's Cathedral. Fr. Carry completed the south (Wanwadi) side of the church, with its pinnacled buttresses. The north side (Ghorpuri) was completed later by Fr. Esseiva, S.J. The Diocese of Poona was created in 1886 and Jesuit missionary Bernard Beider Linden was appointed the first bishop. Thus, St. Patrick's Church became St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1887. On 15 July 1984, the roof of the cathedral collapsed. With donations from benefactors, the cathedral was rebuilt with a new curved vault roof designed by architect Charles Correa in place of the old pointed roof. The re-dedication of St. Patrick's Cathedral was held on 22 October 1987. Eventually, the cathedral was again in need of repairs with the passage of time. Major renovation, repairs and redecoration of the cathedral was from 2009 to 2010, three of the highlights of which were a new backdrop to the sanctuary wall with a mosaic of the Risen Christ, 16 unique stained glass panels of the life of Jesus and a skylight above the altar depicting the Holy Spirit in stained glass.

In 1922 he left Latvia for the United States, where he became the Rabbi and Av Beit Din (head judge of religious court) of Jersey City, New Jersey. He remained there until his death in 1948.  Youth  Bloch was born in Plungƒó, Lithuania, on September 14, 1865 to an illustrious rabbinic family with family roots traced back to the Shakh and Isaiah Horowitz. Until the age of 15, Bloch was taught Torah by his father, Rabbi Hanoch Zundel Bloch Hacohen, the local shochet of the town. After his 15th birthday, Bloch left Plunge to study Torah by Rav Simha Zissel in Yeshivat Grobin. Unique in its time, the Yeshivah at Grobin had a dual curriculum of Jewish and Secular studies. Under the guidance of Rav Simcha Zissel, the young teenager grew very diligent in his Torah study and rose to an advanced level in Talmud. Rav Simcha Zissel heavily emphasized the study of Mussar, which had a profound impact on young Bloch's personality for the rest of his life.personal communication-R' Aaron Soloveitchik  Formative years  At the age of 18, Hayyim Bloch decided to leave Grobin and learn instead in the famed Volozhin Yeshiva under the illustrious Rabbi Hayyim Soloveitchik, the founder of the \\"Brisker Derech\\", and Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin-the \\"Neziv\\". Rabbi Solovietchik had a deep love and admiration for his young disciple, and Bloch studied under him for seven years. In 1890, at the age of 25, Bloch was granted semikha by his teacher, Rabbi Hayyim Solovietchik, as well as by the Telzer Rosh Yeshiva, Harav Eliezer Gordon. While in Volozhin, Bloch devoted much of his time to a study of the Ritba's commentary on the Talmud. For Bloch, the Ritba became his \\"master and teacher\\" in Talmud, and he was almost able to render his commentary on the Talmud by heart. As a yeshivah student, Bloch wrote for the Slutzk journal, Yagdil Torah, as well as Migdal Torah, another Talmudic based periodical. Although Bloch spent most of his time in Volozhin immersed in the intellectually stimulating world of conceptual talmudic study, he also (like many students in Volozhin at this time ) explored other areas of thought, most notably the Haskala. While in Volozhin, Bloch began writing for the Warsaw pro-Zionist pro Haskala daily, Ha-Zefirah, and in 1887 at the age of 22, became editor of the column Wisdom of Israel.  Rosh Yeshiva of Plunge Yeshiva  If Bloch had left his hometown of Plunge as a promising adolescent of 15, he now returned (1891) an accomplished talmudic scholar with rabbinic ordination from the most prestigious Yeshiva in Europe and a primary disciple of Rabbi Hayyim Solovietchik‚Äîa true rising star on the European rabbinic scene. In the year 1895, Bloch founded a Yeshiva in Plunge for elite high-school aged students. He was the Rosh Yeshiva and primary talmudic instructor at the Yeshiva for four years. Rabbinical faculty members included Rabbi Shlomo Itzel, Rabbi Zelig, and Rabbi Ben-Zion Feldman. During his tenure as Rosh Yeshiva, he oversaw the development of numerous budding torah scholars, including the future Ponevhzer Rav, Rav Yosef Kahaneman. Bloch recognized Kahaneman's potential as a future leader of Jewry and showered him with special attention and praise. Bloch taught the young Kahaneman at a pace appropriate for his abilities and age, and is credited as being the teacher who inspired Kahaneman to greatness in Torah learning.  Palongen Rabbinate  After serving for four years as the Rosh Yeshivah of the Yeshiva in Plunge, Bloch was appointed the communal rabbi and Av Beit Din (head of Jewish court) of nearby Palanga, a seaside town on the shore of the Baltic. Bloch was also the officially appointed government Rabbi. A year into his position as Rabbi, Bloch heard that his prized disciple Yosef Kahanemen had not gotten into the Telz Yeshiva. Bloch invited his student to Palongen to study with him, and after a year of assisting the budding scholar in his talmudics, Kahanemen applied to Telz and was accepted.  Bauska Rabbinate  Following the departure of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook to head the Chief Rabbinate of Israel in 1904, the Bauska Jewish community decided to elect Rabbi Bloch as his successor.L Dribins, A Guttmanis, and M Vestermanis, \\"Latvia's Jewish Community: History, Tragedy, Survival\\", Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia, ca. 2001. http://www.am.gov.lv/en/ministry/4265/4299/?print=on_LATVIA%27s_JEWISH_COMMUNITY:_HISTORY,_TRAGEDY,_REVIVAL , accessed 16 October 2008. Bauska, a town in the Courland Governorate, (now Latvia) was at the time under Russian control and had Russian residence laws on the books which precluded Lithuanian Jews from residing within Courland. Bloch, a Lithuanian, succeeded in receiving rights of residence by filling the then vacant position of government district rabbi, known in Russian as the \\"Kazyonny Ravvin\\". To receive this position, Bloch completed the equivalent of a six-year secondary school education. Bloch was the only Russian rabbi to hold the dual post of communal rabbi and kazyonny ravvin. Among the many duties of the kazyonny ravvin was the delivering of patriotic speeches on festivals and birthdays of the czars.

Francis left Landais in control of the affairs of the duchy, producing resentment among local barons, who finally secured the overthrow of Landais' r√©gime. The rise and fall of Landais undermined Francis' position and prepared the way for the annexation of Brittany by France. Landais is also important for the key role he played during attempts by the Yorkist kings of England to extradite the leading Lancastrian contender for the English throne, Henry Tudor, who was living in Brittany with his principal supporters. Initially a supporter of Henry, he later turned against him. Biography =Early career= Landais was the son of rich clothiers from Vitr√©. He entered the service of Duke as a valet de garde-robe. His ambition and acumen soon brought him favour with Francis, and he rose to become Treasurer and Receiver General of Brittany.William J. Roberts, France: a reference guide from the Renaissance to the present, Infobase, 2004, p.36. He promoted the interests of the bourgeoisie, and encouraged trade and enterprise. Landais soon came into conflict with Guillaume Chauvin, who was chancellor of Brittany, and who resented Landais' influence over the duke. In 1477, his rivalry with Chauvin reached a head. Landais managed to ensure Chauvin's arrest and dismissal on corruption charges, securing his own position as de facto prime minister under Francis. During this period he encouraged the expansion of the University of Nantes, founded by duke Francis in 1460.Georges Minois. Anne de Bretagne. Fayard : Paris, 1999 =R√©gime= All-powerful between 1481 and 1485, he strove to defend the independence of the duchy against the machinations of Louis XI, the King of France, engaging in secret negotiations with King Edward IV of England. Landais also negotiated trade agreements with Spain, Portugal, England and the Hanseatic cities. He further promoted silk and tapestry production. After the death of Louis, he attempted to marry Francis' heir Anne of Brittany to the Duke of Orleans. Landais had Guillaume Chauvin moved from prison to prison, resisting pressure to release him. Chauvin died on 5 April 1484, allegedly from starvation and abuse. Chauvin's ill treatment caused outrage among the Breton aristocracy, who were already disturbed by Landais' power. Encouraged by Anne of Beaujeu, regent of France, his enemies organised a coup against him. Led by John IV of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange, an armed gang attempted to capture Landais, but he escaped.Louisa Stuart Costello, Memoirs of Anne, Duchess of Brittany, Twice Queen of France, 2009 reprint, pp.17-18; 43-4. The duke ordered that the property of the conspirators against Landais should be confiscated. The rebels were forced into exile. =Henry Tudor= Still enjoying the support of the duke, Landais engaged in negotiations with supporters of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, Lancastrian claimant to the throne of England, who was living in exile in Brittany, occupying the Ch√¢teau de Suscinio, Sarzeau, as guests of Duke Francis. Naval conflicts has arisen with England following the accession of king Richard III. English privateers were attacking Breton ships. Landais initially attempted to appease Richard, but later switched his support to Henry in the hope that he would overthrow Richard, thus producing an alliance between England and Brittany. However, the plot failed, and Henry was forced to return to Brittany. Landais made overtures to Richard once more. The king offered to send 4,000 English and Welsh archers to help secure the Duke's power against the rebel Breton nobility, who were continuing to plot against Landais. In return, Landais was to arrange the capture and extradition of Henry, his uncle Jasper Tudor, and the other exiled Lancastrians. Duke Francis had pledged to support Henry, but he was seriously ill at this time and Landais had complete control of the government. He assembled an armed force in Rennes, to march to Vannes and capture all of the Lancastrians, who by this time numbered around 300, including many experienced soldiers. Henry was informed of the plot. Facing arrest and extradition to England, Henry and Jasper fled across the nearest border into Anjou, crossing only hours ahead of Landais' troops. Henry took the road towards Angers, en route for the French Court at Langeais, and secured French support for his later successful campaign against Richard. When Duke Francis recovered, he was furious with Landais, and allowed Henry's followers to leave Brittany and to join him.Wagner, John \\"Pierre Landais\\", Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses, ABC-CLIO, 2001, p.143. =Overthrow and death= Landais' machinations only increased the number of his aristocratic enemies, who were supported by Anne of Beaujeu. By 1485 the pro-French faction had organised an army of supporters. Landais' enemies arrived at Nantes at the head of this army on 25 June 1485.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Pierre Landais The duke was forced to deliver Landais to be tried for various alleged crimes. He was accused of extortion and causing the death of Chauvin. Under torture, he confessed to numerous misdeeds. Tried and sentenced, Pierre Landais was hanged on 19 July 1485 in the meadow of Biesse in Nantes. Legacy and reputation Landais' only child with his wife Jeanne was a daughter, Fran√ßoise. She inherited his estates. Her son became a bishop. The coup exposed the weakness of Duke Francis, which was soon exploited by Anne of Beaujeu, resulting in a full-scale French invasion of Brittany in 1488. The English chronicler Raphael Holinshed described Landais (who he calls \\"Peter Landois\\") as \\"a man both of pregnant wit and great authority, [who] ruled and adjudged all things at his pleasure and commandement, for which cause (as men set in authority be not best beloved) he excited and provoked against him the malice and evil will of the nobility of Britaine [Brittany]\\". Also as Peter Landois he appears as a character in the Elizabethan play The True Tragedy of Richard III, which influenced Shakespeare's Richard III. He is inaccurately included among Henry Tudor's loyal allies before the Battle of Bosworth. According to Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie French historians of the ancien regime were generally very negative in their estimation of him. He says \\"the old historians were very hostile to Landais. Alain Bouchart (who wrote around thirty years after the death of the treasurer-general) represents him as 'a person of a little wisdom and of base extraction'\\". De la Borderie quotes D'Agentr√©, who says Landais was a virtual dictator, \\"no-one could get anything except through him: estates, offices, benefices, hung on his whims...His position made him so arrogant and haughty that he misused princes, lords and gentry alike.\\" Dom Lobineau claimed that he became the chief minister after facilitating the \\"secret pleasures\\" of the Duke. Such views became less common after the Revolution. De la Borderie argues that the hostility is partly aristocratic distaste for parvenus and partly because Landais sought an alliance with England against France.Borderie, Arthur de la, Histoire de Bretagne, tome 4, 1904, pp.471 ff.

It had its origins in preparing outbound Peace Corps Volunteers for their assignments and was the first international exchange program to involve a family homestay. EIL was selected by the original architects of the Peace Corps, because the professionals at EIL were known to have a strong system for teaching the nuances of culture shock preparedness. Experiment assisted after World War II when they lead teaching voyages on a series of decommissioned warships with the members of the Student Council on Travel. The School for International Training (SIT) was established in 1964.World Learning, \\"History\\". Accessed: May 16, 2012. SIT filled a need of returned Peace Corps volunteers by offering a graduate degree in International Development. The Vermont campus originally consisted of a small collection of dorms around a Carriage House on a scenic farm on the north end of Brattleboro. These early Peace Corps volunteers took lessons in foreign languages with materials and teachers from the language training from their service, and The School for International Training began to expand its offerings. By 1968, the small but increasing number of returned Peace Corps volunteers were requesting a degree in Teaching English as a Second Language, a new speciality. In 1969, two graduate programs were developed, International Career Training (ICT), and Masters in Teaching Languages (MAT) (French, Spanish and ESL). In the late 1970s, the 1980s, and 1990s there was an undergraduate program called the World Issues Program (WIP). It was a two-year program for transfer juniors and seniors. During the early years, a group of students published a book entitled \\"Process: About Learning and Caring\\" which speaks about the difficulties and rewards of transformational education. Inspired by a speech by United Nations leader U Thant, the program provided classes in Peace and Conflict Studies, Alternative Energy Sources, Population Studies, International Economics and Environmental Studies. After the first year spent on campus, students had year-long internships in different sites around the world. The final semester consisted of research into one of these areas on a topic of the student's choice, and presentations of research results. The program was usually completed through submission of a Bachelor's Thesis or combination of projects. After 22 graduating classes, nearby Marlboro College adopted this program and offered it on their campus. The International Visitor Leadership Project has brought community activists, legislators and regional leaders to campus to study the means of bringing peace to such war-torn places as Rwanda, Ireland, Bosnia or Israel/Palestine. Today The Experiment in International Living is the longest functioning exchange program and has paved the way into a more peaceful and just world, by transforming students though international experiences and homestays.EIL SIT Graduate Institute is the accredited master's degree program of World Learning, offering Master of Arts degrees in Conflict Transformation; International Education; Sustainable Development; Intercultural Service, Leadership and Management; and Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.SIT Graduate Institute, \\"Master's Degree and Certificate Programs.\\" Accessed: May 16, 2012.

The large quantity of statues, petroglyphs and pottery found at the site, and on other islands in the Zapatera archipelago, suggests the area was an important ceremonial centre of pre-Columbian Chorotega people between 800 and 1350 CE. Geography Isla Zapatera is a dormant volcano high, with an area of ‚Äì making it the second largest island in Lake Nicaragua, after Ometepe. It is situated in a relatively shallow and calm area of the lake known as Charco Muerto () and, at its closest point to the northwest, it is just from the mainland. Zapatera and ten nearby islands and islets form the Zapatera archipelago. History In 1849 Zapatera was visited by American diplomat and archaeologist Ephraim George Squier, who noted the presence of a considerable amount of statues and petroglyphs in an area known as Punta de las Figuras. More than 30 years later, in 1883, Squier's report encouraged Swedish naturalist Carl Bovallius to undertake a more extensive survey of the island. Bovallius discovered 25 statues in Sonzapote and a number of petroglyphs on the islet of La Ceiba. Mexican Felipe Pardines also published a series of articles on the El Muerto island petroglyphs in the 1930s. The most recent archaeological investigations were carried out in the 1980s and involved a number of small excavations, but an in depth study of the island is still lacking. Looting and the removal of the archaeological remains has been a persistent problem at Zapatera. Almost all the statues have been removed from the island: a sizeable collection is preserved in San Francisco Convent Museum in Granada, but many others are used as ornament in state buildings or have found their way into the hands of private collectors. Smaller finds have also been largely dispersed into private or foreign museum collections. Finds The statues and the majority of the petroglyphs and pottery at Zapatera have been dated to between 800 and 1350 CE, and is ascribed to the Chorotega, an indigenous Mesoamerican culture. Finds from this period also include utensils and zoomorphic figurines in a similar style to examples from the mainland. Some of the petroglyphs and pottery may date back as far as 500 BCE, and others are contemporary with Spanish colonies. The most prominent finds from Zapatera were statues. According to records, they were carved of black basalt, generally between high, and more than in diameter. They depicted both humans and animals and are speculated to represent either deities or high-status individuals. Most are found around earthen or stone mounds, facing outwards, suggesting they formed part of a ceremonial installation. On the basis of engravings near these sites it has been proposed that they may have been host to human sacrifices.

It was published in six volumes in 1754, 1756, 1759, and 1761. The first publication of his History was greeted with outrage by all political factions, but it became a best-seller, finally giving him the financial independence he had long sought. Both the British Library and the Cambridge University Library, as well as Hume's own library, still list him as \\"David Hume, the historian.\\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, entry on Hume Hume's History spanned \\"from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688\\" and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it the standard history of England in its day. Publication history Hume set out at first only to write a history of England under the Stuart monarchs James I and Charles I, which appeared in 1754. He followed this with a second history that continued to the Revolution of 1688. With the relative success of these two volumes, Hume researched the history of earlier eras and produced a total of six volumes. As a result, the fifth volume was the first to appear in print, in 1754, while the first two volumes were published last, in 1762. The complete History of England is arranged in chronological order, as follows: * Vols. 1‚Äì2: The history of England from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the accession of Henry VII (i.e. 55 BC ‚Äì AD 1485; first published in 1762)See * Vols. 3‚Äì4.

The history of Great Britain, containing the reigns of James I and Charles I (covering the years 1601‚Äì1649; published 1754) * Vol. 6. The history of Great Britain, containing the Commonwealth, and the reigns of Charles II and James II (covering the years 1649‚Äì1688; published 1757) Because of the titles of the last two volumes, the whole work has occasionally been mistakenly referred to as History of Great Britain rather than History of England. Circumstances of the work's composition The last Jacobite uprising of 1745 was a very recent memory, and had come close to turning the War of the Austrian Succession into a war of the British succession. This had come as a shock to Hume. So his main concern was to legitimise the Revolution of 1688, and forestall any future insurrection. He wanted his philosophy of Government to appeal to both Whigs and former Jacobites. Perhaps this can be best understood in his 1748 essay \\"Of the Original Contract\\". He was not an adherent of any party. In England, anti-Scottish prejudice was running high. Hume was a master of the internalised Scoticism,this phenomenon appears to have been defined by David Masson and even wrote a booklet about how to do it. The History of England is a classic of the genre. It helps understand Hume to re-externalise the milieu that he flourished in. The Revolution of 1688 He wrote of the Revolution: \\"By deciding many important questions in favour of liberty, and still more, by that great precedent of deposing one king, and establishing a new family, it gave such an ascendent to popular principles, as has put the nature of the English Constitution beyond all controversy\\". Thus Hume is at odds with those who argue that the British Constitution is entirely evolutionary, and did not emerge from a revolution, just like the later American and French Constitutions, and the earlier Dutch Constitution. The source of this antinomian interpretation of British freedom can be traced in Hume's account of the revolutionary debates themselves. William of Orange had been invited to invade by a coalition of English Whigs and Tories. To placate the latter's maxim that \\"the throne was never vacant\\", or in modern parlance the monarch never dies, the fiction was agreed that King James would be said to have abdicated. It fell to the Scottish Parliamentary Convention, meeting a month after the English one: \\"in a bold and decisive vote\\", to declare \\"that king James, by his maladministration, and his abuse of power, had forfeited all title to the crown\\". Hume wanted to present the UK as having a modern constitution. He did not see it as something that stretched back seamlessly to Magna Carta or the laws of King Alfred. The narrative ends with a parliamentary convention annexing to the settlement \\"a declaration of rights, where all the points, which had, of late years, been disputed between king and people, were finally determined; and the powers of the royal prerogative were more narrowly circumscribed and more exactly defined, than in any former period of the English government\\". In fact Britain has two declarations of right from this period. The Bill of Rights is (or was) the basic law of England, the Claim of Right that for Scotland. There are important differences between these little studied declarations. Where the Bill of Rights states that the King cannot make laws without the consent of Parliament, the Claim of Right says that all assertions of a right to rule above the law are themselves against the law. The Bill of Rights was inspired by John Locke. Behind the Claim of Right can be detected the guiding hand of James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair 1619‚Äì1695.See Macaulay's rather dusty account. This Stair is not to be confused with his son, the genocidaire of Glencoe. Hume studied law as a student at Edinburgh. He implies that he neglected this study.My Own Life. This can be read in vol 1 of the online edition of Hume's History linked above This must be taken with a pinch of salt. He may have wanted to avoid giving the lay reader the impression that he had written a history just for lawyers like William Blackstone. What is certain is that he names two of the founders of Roman Dutch law, Johannes Voet and Arnold Vinnius, in the same breath as Cicero and Virgil. Cicero was, of course, a lawyer. The standard work for a Scottish law student to study was, then as now, \\"Stair's Institutions of the laws of Scotland\\". Hume names neither of the unamended constitutions of 1689. He wanted a new constitution for the United Kingdom to flesh out these outline declarations. He set out his proposals in the essay Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth, which is a reworking of The Commonwealth of Oceana by the 17th-century Rutland visionary James Harrington. Leaving the extent of the Commonwealth and the location of its capital undecided, Hume's highly devolved scheme was \\"to have all the advantages both of a great and a little Commonwealth\\". In some ways it resembles the model of Presbyterian church government. Hume was no theorist of an unwritten constitution. Narrative The work can perhaps be best discussed as four separate histories in the order in which he wrote them. =The History of Great Britain Part 1= The book begins auspiciously with James VI of Scotland peacefully assuming the title of first King of Great Britain. He immediately began a series of attempts to promote a Union between his two kingdoms, and found for this a staunch ally in Francis Bacon. These came to nothing, curiously more because of opposition in the English Parliament than in the Scottish one. On the whole, Hume portrays this complex king, who had grown up with the same predicament as Orestes, as a beneficent ruler keeping Britain at peace, notably by staying out of the Thirty Years' War. However an epic of unintended consequences was unravelling. As the King was dying, his son's wooing of the Spanish Infanta turned into a jilting, and the two countries drifted into a war, spurred on by Protestant extremists in the House of Commons. Charles I's attempt following the Petition of Right (1628) to rule without a Parliament in England collapsed after he provoked the revolution of the National Covenant in Scotland (1638). Irish Catholics led by Felim O'Neill seized the opportunity to rebel (1641). Civil War broke out in England. The king was defeated, tried, and executed (1649). Thus Hume's first volume ends at the start of England's short-lived experiment with republicanism. Of the book's reception, Hume wrote: > I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; > English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig and Tory, churchman and sectary, > freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage > against the man, who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of > Charles I, and the Earl of Strafford. =The History of Great Britain Part 2= Hume continues the story with an account of: the leveller experiment with communism; of the Scottish Parliament's proclamation of Charles II as king; of Cromwell's genocidal suppression of the Irish revolt; of his near nemesis at the Battle of Dunbar; of the crowning of Charles II at Scone; of Cromwell's final destruction of the now royalist Covenanter army at the Battle of Worcester; and of his subsequent annexation of Scotland. After Cromwell's death, his son Richard Cromwell, \\"Tumbledown Dick\\", could not keep the republic together; and General Monck brought the army of occupation in Scotland south to effect the Restoration. This was followed by the execution of the remaining regicides: \\"... a mind, seasoned with humanity, will find a plentiful source of compassion and indulgence ... No saint or confessor ever went to martyrdom with more assured confidence of heaven than was expressed by those criminals, even when the terrors of immediate death, joined to many indignities, were set before them.\\". They were hanged drawn and quartered. Four (already dead) were disinterred and subject to Posthumous execution. Of this volume, Hume wrote: \\"In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was published the second volume of my History, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.\\". =The History of the House of Tudor= This history, written during the Seven Years' War, starts (Vol. 3) with the final overthrow and extinction of the old Plantagenet royal family by the Anglo-Welsh Henry Tudor; and his success in gaining acceptance for what was a weak hereditary claim. Robert Adamson tells us that this was the point where Adam Smith wanted Hume to begin the history.article \\"Hume\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 9th edition There follows the reign of Henry VIII, and his break with Rome; the English Reformation under his ill-starred son Edward VI; and the attempt at counter-reformation by his daughter \\"bloody\\" Mary I. Vol. 4 continues with the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Hume wrote: \\"In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor. The clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious\\". Hume's portrayal of Elizabeth is hardly flattering. However, there was another reason for the outrage. Hume, along with Dr. William Robertson, had been examining the papers relative to Mary, Queen of Scots. Both historians found that Queen Mary had indeed been complicit in the murder of her husband Darnley, thus exonerating what the Scottish Parliament had said when they deposed her. There have been copious attempts to refute Hume and Robertson on this.An outstanding question is what part this controversy had in the education of Catherine the Great, who also appears to have been an uxoricide. It could be said in partial expiation of Mary that Catherine seems to have succeeded where Darnley had failed. Neither Darnley nor Catherine had any claim to the throne, except through their spouses. It is said of Catherine that she sent Robertson a gem studded snuff- box, and that this is listed in his will. =The Early History of England= Vol 2 covers the period following the establishment of the Magna Carta, through to the auto-destruction of the Plantagenet dynasty in the Wars of the Roses. This could be described as the time when the English Nation was reinvented, after two centuries of Franco-Norman subjugation. Volume 1 takes the story back to the foundation of the first English kingdoms, the heptarchy: Kent, Northumberland, East Anglia, Mercia, Essex, Sussex, and Wessex; and to the Romano-Welsh imperium these kingdoms supplanted. The work as constitutional history Hume wrote several appendices and discursions, which may be classed in their apparent order of composition, covering: 1) the Shakespearean period; 2) the period up until the restoration; 3) the period ending with the Revolution; 4) the period of the Tudors; 5) the Anglo-Saxon period; 6) the period up until the signing and gradual implementation of Magna Carta; 7) the era of Edward III; and 8) the period ending with the overthrow of Richard Plantagenet. This last discursion at the end of vol 2 is a summary of some of Hume's most developed thoughts (chapter XXII). An anti-Jacobite shibboleth that Hume wanted to refute held that absolute monarchy was an innovation brought to England by James I. When James was writing his Basilicon Doron expounding the divine right of kings, he was king of Scotland alone. He wanted to bring the authoritarian English model of kingship to his unruly northern kingdom. When he came to England, he inherited the oppressive Court of High Commission and the Court of the Star Chamber from the Tudors. He did not increase their powers. On the contrary, Hume found the rule of the first two Stuarts to have been milder than that of Elizabeth. The revolutionary ferment was not caused by any novel oppression. However Hume did acknowledge that the divine right, or patriarchal, system of government itself had a historical origin. This he dates to the time of the first two Tudors: Henry VII and Henry VIII. Before that date: \\"a kind of Polish Aristocracy prevailed ...\\". In Humes's time the Polish aristocracy elected their king. This just predates the long period of the Partitions of Poland between the Hohenzollern, Habsburg, and Romanov autocracies. It was possible to agree at that time with Montesquieu that the Polish Szlachta, or aristocracy, had remained as a bulwark against autocracy, which had been lost by aristocrats like himself through the centralisation of Bourbon power in France. Very recent history was the abolition of heritable jurisdictions. Before that law was passed, local aristocrats in Scotland had the power to try cases and raise armies, as the Government had just learnt to its cost. Far from exporting divine right principles to England: Scotland, like Poland, had never become a centralised Renaissance monarchy. Similarly, in England before the Tudors, \\"... though the kings were limited, the people were as yet far from being free. It required the authority almost absolute of the sovereigns, which took place in the subsequent period, to pull down those disorderly and licentious tyrants, who were equally averse from peace and from freedom, and to establish that regular execution of the laws, which, in a following age, enabled the people to erect a regular and equitable plan of liberty\\". A heritable jurisdiction might be conducted with equity, if presided over by someone like Montesquieu; but there is even less guarantee than there is in the judiciary of an autocracy. The convention that the kings could not raise taxes without parliamentary consent, Hume dates to the time of the usurpers of the House of Lancaster, who needed to bolster their shaky claim to the throne with warlord support. The reluctance of the House of Commons to fund the executive, led the otherwise absolutist Tudors to grant monopolies, force loans, and raise funds by other irregular measures. These practices came to a head under the Stuarts, but they did not initiate them. This earlier era of Polish style aristocracy came about through the gradual implementation of Magna Carta; before which the kings had been more absolute, ruling by right of conquest. The early Normans in turn had subjugated the Saxons, among whom \\"the balance seems to have inclined [again] to the side of aristocracy\\" or oligarchy. He allows that the early Saxons and other Germans \\"seem to have admitted a considerable mixture of democracy into their form of government, and to have been one of the freest nations, of which there remains any account in the records of history\\"; but he cautions: \\"Those who, from a pretended respect to antiquity, appeal at every turn to an original plan of the constitution, only cover their turbulent spirit and their private ambition under the appearance of venerable forms\\". Under the Saxons, there was never much freedom for the Ancient Britons. He saw in the patriarchy of the Tudors and Stuarts \\"the dawn of civility and sciences\\". It was also the time of the terminal decline of serfdom, free men having become of greater commercial value. A history of political economy in England Hume's fundamental theorem, quoted by Adamson, is that: \\"everything in the world is purchased by labour, and our passions are the only causes of labour\\". His position is very close here to Adam Smith. The work contains several discursions on the fluctuations in the price of corn and other commodities through the eras. The Crusades as the nadir of western civilisation \\"The rise, progress, perfection, and decline of art and science, are curious objects of contemplation, and intimately connected with a narration of civil transactions. The events of no particular period can be fully accounted for, but by considering the degrees of advancement, which men have reached in those particulars.\\" Ever a classicist, he saw the age of Augustus as a high point in civilisation, after which there had been an inexorable decline: \\"But there is a point of depression, as well as of exaltation, from which human affairs naturally return in a contrary direction, and beyond which they seldom pass either in their advancement or decline. The period, in which the people of Christendom were the lowest sunk in ignorance, and consequently in disorders of every kind, may justly be fixed at the eleventh century, about the age of William the Conqueror\\". The Norman Conquest was the most destructive trauma that the English nation has endured. However this was followed by something even worse, during the next generation. Hume described the crusades, beginning in the reign of William Rufus, as \\"the most signal and most durable monument of human folly, that has yet appeared in any age or nation\\" (chapter V). The storming of Jerusalem, 5 July 1099, was attended by a wholesale genocide of Muslims and Jews (chapter 6). \\"... the triumphant warriors, after every enemy was subdued and slaughtered, immediately turned themselves, with the sentiments of humiliation and contrition, towards the holy sepulchre. They threw aside their arms, still streaming with blood: They advanced with reclined bodies, and naked feet and heads to that sacred monument: They sung anthems to their Saviour, who had there purchased their salvation by his death and agony: And their devotion, enlivened by the presence of the place where he had suffered, so overcame their fury, that they dissolved in tears, and bore the appearance of every soft and tender sentiment. So inconsistent is human nature with itself! And so easily does the most effeminate superstition ally, both with the most heroic courage, and with the fiercest barbarity!\\" Hume seems to have had access to some version or other of the Koran, which he calls the \\"alcoran\\"; and he was aware of what is now remembered as the Golden Age of Islam. \\"The advantage indeed of science, moderation, humanity, was at that time entirely on the side of the Saracens\\". The results of the First Crusade were reversed during the following century. He contrasts Saladin with Richard Coeur de Lion: \\"this gallant emperor [Saladin], in particular, displayed, during the course of the war, a spirit and generosity, which even his bigotted enemies were obliged to acknowledge and admire. Richard, equally martial and brave, carried with him more of the barbarian character; and was guilty of acts of ferocity, which threw a stain on his celebrated victories\\". Hume also writes that on one occasion, Richard ordered the massacre of 5000 defenceless Muslim prisoners, although \\"the Saracens found themselves obliged to retaliate upon the Christians by a like cruelty\\". Hume tells how, shortly after his great victory, Saladin's death was proclaimed: \\"he ordered his winding-sheet to be carried as a standard through every street of the city; while a crier went before, and proclaimed with a loud voice, This is all that remains to the mighty Saladin, the conqueror of the East\\". Saladin left his money to charity, \\"without distinction of Jew, Christian, or Mahometan\\". This point of view was followed shortly afterwards in Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The Pandects of Justinian However, even in the 12th century, there was a glimmer of light. \\"Perhaps there was no event, which tended farther to the improvement of the age, than one, which has not been much remarked, the accidental finding of a copy of Justinian's Pandects, about the year 1130, in the town of Amalfi in Italy.\\" Hume would have known about the Pandects as a law student, because Stair's \\"Institutions\\" are largely based on them, as are the works of Voet and Vinnius. \\"It is easy to see what advantages Europe must have reaped by its inheriting at once from the ancients, so complete an art, which was also so necessary for giving security to all other arts, and which, by refining, and still more, by bestowing solidity on the judgment, served as a model to farther improvements.\\" Hume credits the clergy with spreading the newly found Romano-Greek jurisprudence. However the association the English laity \\"formed without any necessity\\" between Roman and canon law: \\"prevented the Roman jurisprudence from becoming the municipal law of the country, as was the case in many states of Europe\\". Nevertheless, \\"a great part of it was secretly transferred into the practice of the courts of justice, and the imitation of their neighbours made the English gradually endeavour to raise their own law from its original state of rudeness and imperfection\\". Thus Hume was writing the history of the Common Law of England from its origins through its continuing gradual absorption of the international Civil Law. Hume's nephew and executor, also called David Hume, wrote the \\"Commentary on the laws of Scotland respecting crimes\\" as a common law companion to Stair's great work. Both David Humes are buried together, in the old cemetery on the Calton Hill in Edinburgh. Hume on the progress of natural philosophy and belles lettres in England The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (linked below) describes Hume as \\"the third of the great triumvirate of \\"British Empiricists\\", along with John Locke and Thomas Hobbes. However, he footnotes Locke, along with Algernon Sidney, Rapin de Thoyras and Benjamin Hoadley, as authors whose \\"compositions the most despicable, both for style and matter, have been extolled, and propagated, and read; as if they had equalled the most celebrated remains of antiquity\\". Sidney was a complex man. He was appalled by the death sentence on Charles I, but later wrote tracts justifying the deed. In 1683, he was beheaded for alleged complicity in the Rye House plot to murder Charles II, after a notoriously unfair trial. Rapin was a French Protestant who had written a monumental history of England dedicated to George I. Bishop Hoadley was another luminary of the whig establishment. What Hume particularly objects to in Locke is his presentation of Robert Filmer's \\"absurd\\" patriarchal theory of government as if it were something new. What these writers shared was belief in a neverland of ancient English freedoms, which the Stuarts had overthrown. Nor does Hobbes fare any better with Hume: \\"Hobbes's politics are fitted only to promote tyranny, and his ethics to encourage licentiousness. Though an enemy to religion, he partakes nothing of the spirit of scepticism; but is as positive and dogmatical as if human reason, and his reason in particular, could attain a thorough conviction in these subjects... In his own person he is represented to have been a man of virtue; a character no wise surprising, notwithstanding his libertine system of ethics. Timidity is the principal fault, with which he is reproached: He lived to an extreme old age, yet could never reconcile himself to the thoughts of death. The boldness of his opinions and sentiments form a remarkable contrast to this part of his character. He died in 1679, aged 91.\\" Hume follows this withering notice on Hobbes with a judiciously favourable review of James Harrington's The Commonwealth of Oceana. \\"In Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species\\". After noting advances made by Boyle and Hooke in the mechanical philosophy, Hume says: \\"While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he shewed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain\\". Hume was no mathematical reductionist, like Hobbes. The only 17th- century Scottish philosopher, other than James I, that Hume applauds is John Napier of Merchiston, the inventor of logarithms. However Napier, Newton and James I are criticised for producing eschatological literature predicting the final days. Writings of this sort were a potent factor in the politico- religious ferment of the time.See Scottish National Consciousness in the Age of James VI Arthur H. Williamson They were calling for a purification in preparation for the new age of the second coming. Of these three alchemists, Hume writes: \\"From the grossness of its superstitions, we may infer the ignorance of an age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of an individual, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated by the appearance of religion\\". He calls Francis Bacon \\"the greatest glory of literature in this island\\" at the time of James I. However, he also criticises Bacon, in contrast with the earlier Kepler, for treating Copernicus's discovery of the solar system with disdain. Of Galileo, Hume writes that Italy had \\"too much neglected the renown which it has acquired by giving birth to so great a man\\". A more extended critique of these early political scientists can be found in \\"Hobbes\\" by George Croom Robertson.\\"Hobbes\\", George Croom Robertson, William Blackwood and sons, 1886 Hume allows Arthur, and even Woden, to have been shadowy historic figures, and he mentions the poet Taliesin (Thaliessin). He rates Alfred the Great beside Charlemagne as a man of letters: \\"Alfred endeavoured to convey his morality by apologues, parables, stories, apophthegms, couched in poetry; and besides propagating among his subjects, former compositions of that kind, which he found in the Saxon tongue, he exercised his genius in inventing works of a like nature, as well as in translating from the Greek the elegant fables of Aesop. He also gave Saxon translations of Orosius's and Bede's histories; and of Boethius concerning the consolation of philosophy\\". Actually some of these works were commissioned by Alfred, not by him. None of the later writers of Arthurian romances get a mention. That is unsurprising. They were (most but not all) glorifying what Hume saw as a period of decadence and decline. \\"The arts and sciences were imported from Italy into this island as early as into France; and made at first more sensible advances...\\". So in some need of explanation is why he neglects to mention either Chaucer, Gower or Langland, or what is now called the Ricardian Renaissance. Nor does he mention Chaucer's model Boccaccio either, nor even Dante. He does mention Petrarch, but the rest of the named Italians are of the generation of the High Renaissance: Tasso, Ariosto and Guarini. What Hume found in these Italian writers of the 16th century was romances set in the darkest days of the crusades, featuring antiheroes, Christian or Muslim. He censured Shakespeare's \\"barbarism\\", but insisted that \\"...Spenser, Shakespeare, Bacon, Jonson were superior to their contemporaries, who flourished in that kingdom (France). Milton, (Edmund) Waller, (John) Denham, (Benjamin) Cowley, (William?) Harvey were at least equal to their contemporaries. The reign of Charles II, which some preposterously represent as our Augustan age, retarded the progress of polite literature in this island, and it was then found that the immeasurable licentiousness, indulged or rather applauded at court, was more destructive to the refined arts, than even the cant, nonsense, and enthusiasm of the preceding period\\". Hume passes on an oral tradition about John Milton and the playwright William Davenant: \\"It is not strange, that Milton received no encouragement after the restoration: It is more to be admired, that he escaped with his life\\" (for eloquently justifying the regicide). \\"Many of the cavaliers blamed extremely that lenity towards him, which was so honourable in the king, and so advantageous to posterity. It is said, that he had saved Davenant's life during the protectorship; and Davenant in return afforded him like protection after the restoration; being sensible, that men of letters ought always to regard their sympathy of taste as a more powerful band of union, than any difference of party or opinion as a source of animosity\\". Criticism Since the time of its publication, Hume's History has been accused of historical revisionism intending to promote toryism. In the United States, founding father, Thomas Jefferson considered it a \\"poison\\" and was so critical of the work that he censored it from the University of Virginia library. In a 12 August 1810 letter to William Duane Jefferson wrote: \\"It is this book which has undermined the free principles of the English government, [...]\\" And in a letter to John Adams dated 25 November 1816, he wrote: \\"This single book has done more to sap the free principles of the English Constitution than the largest standing army [...]\\" Though generally acknowledged as a plagiarised version of Hume's work, John Baxter's A New and Impartial History of England (1796) was cited by Jefferson as a remedy to Hume's revisionism: \\"He has taken Hume's work, corrected in the text his misrepresentations, supplied the truths which he suppressed, and yet has given the mass of the work in Hume's own words.\\" At the end of his life, Hume wrote: \\"... though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther study, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty\\". An example of such an alteration is the footnote to the remark above about \\"despicable productions\\". The quote here is taken from the online version of 1778. The 1772 Dublin edition only mentions Rapin de Thoyras. Clearly, Algernon Sidney and John Locke had sunk in Hume's estimation during his later years. Hume gives a fair account of Sidney's trial, where the law was twisted so that he could be judged, not for anything he had done, but for what he had written and not even tried to publish. An intriguing question is why Hume included Bishop Hoadley in his rogues' gallery. At the time of the first editions, Hoadley was still alive. What Hume was combating was the atavism of Whigs who, like Jefferson, wanted to portray the regicides as heroic patriots who stamped the first great seal of the Commonwealth with the legend: \\"ON THE FIRST YEAR OF FREEDOM, BY GOD‚ÄôS BLESSING, RESTORED, 1648\\" (old style).Hume chapter LI, Geoffrey Robertson QC, \\"The Tyrannicide's Brief\\" p.69 Judge Bradshaw sentenced the King on the grounds of his having broken \\"a contract and bargain made between the king and his people\\", without being able to state what this contract was, or when it had been made. He was uncomfortable with the legality of the English precedents for deposing kings: Edward II and Richard II. So he turned to the Scottish Parliament's precedent in dethroning Queen Mary for complicity in murder (ut supra). display text He could have cited another perfectly good precedent in the dethroning of John Balliol and his replacement with Robert the Bruce; but he passed that precedent by, vaguely referring instead to the numerous dark age regicides recorded in George Buchanan's \\"history\\".George Buchanan, \\"History of Scotland\\"Geoffrey Robertson states (p.185, op.cit.): \\"Many of the 109 kings and queens of Scotland to that date had indeed met sticky ends, but through brutal clan rivalries and power struggles rather than the decision of a court\\". Dark age assassinations are speculation. However in the period coterminous with the Plantagenets through the Wars of the Roses, there were just two regicides in Scotland, both of which were disowned by Parliament, and neither of which altered the succession. This compares with six regicides in England during the same period, five of which were dynastic overthrows, and two of which were infanticides. Atavism is just as detectable in the attorney who led the prosecution against the king, John Cooke. He prosecuted as an English traitor the general of the Scottish Parliament's army for King and Covenant in the War of the Engagement, on the strength of evidence derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth that there had been a dark age union of England and Scotland.Geoffrey of Monmouth, \\"History of the Kings of Britain\\" Astonishingly, Cooke also appealed to recent treaties, notably the Solemn League and Covenant, as a kind of union; though it had just been abrogated by the Rump Parliaments unilateral execution of the king.Geoffrey Robertson QC, op.cit. pp.213‚Äì6. Robertson also tells us that Cooke cited the Duke of Hamilton's peerage of the Earldom of Cambridge as evidence of his English nationality. On this logic, the late Duke of Hanover, who served in the Wehrmacht, should have been tried as a traitor on account of his holding the title: Duke of Cumberland. Instead, he was reinstated as a member of the British Royal Family. Hume passed on an oral tradition that Cromwell, through his Stewart mother, was a cousin of Charles I. Thomas Carlyle did some further research, concluding: \\"The genealogists say, there is no doubt of this pedigree ...\\".Thomas Carlyle, Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches, chapter 3 Carlyle does, however, add in a footnote to that very sentence that \\"This theory [...] has been entirely refuted by Mr. Walter Rye, who shows that Mrs. Cromwell was descended from an old Norfolk family, originally named Styward.\\" There seems to be no further evidence to support Hume's 'oral tradition.' Unlike Locke, Hobbes or Jefferson, Hume considered that government by consent rested on public opinion alone. He did not derive it from a primeval contract made in the state of nature between ruler and ruled, except in a vague anthropological sense. He recognised that such theories are wide open to antinomianism. Undefined social contract theory can be taken as the framework for Hobbist authoritarianism, as easily as it can be for Lockist libertarianism. It can be made to mean anything. Government by contract is not something given in nature, but something in need of definition in relevant circumstances. For Hume, the prevailing British Constitution became contractual when William and Mary signed the declarations of right. This was the result of a lawful forfeiture. Hume did not want it to be seen, as Danton and Trotsky later saw it, as the result of a beheading. Hume was a close friend and correspondent of Benjamin Franklin.Humes Letters, OUP, Letters 2 vols. ed.J.Y.T.Greig; More Letters ed. Raymond Klibansky, Ernest Mossner He came to support independence for the American colonies; and lived just long enough to hear of the American Declaration of Independence. The founding father closest to his thinking was Alexander Hamilton. Like Hume, Hamilton had to put up with prejudice on account of his Scottish ancestry, which he could trace back at least to the time of the Declaration of Arbroath. The publications of Hume's Histories coincided with the revival of the British Tory Party, after decades of being tainted as the Jacobite Party. There is a parallel here with the eclipse of the US Democratic Party, in the decades when it was seen as the party of the aristocracy of the Old South. Part of Jefferson's hostility to Hume may have been associative with Hume's defence of James Macpherson in the Ossian Controversy. Macpherson was a Tory opponent of American independence. In the years after Hume's death the Whig party also reinvented itself as the Liberal party of reform. The philosophic followers of Hume in Scotland were often, like Robert Adamson, of the Liberal left; and tended to see Hume as Tory-leaning. However this must be seen in the context of the self-serving whig history of Hume's time. Hume's roots were in the Revolution of the Scottish Whigs in 1688-9. His grandfather's name is on the Scottish Parliament's muster role as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Berwickshire militia.Acts of the Scottish Parliament, 30 March 1689 Hume lived in a post- revolutionary environment, and he did not want there to be another revolution. He did not demonise heroes of the revolution any more than he glorified them. He wanted them to be examined critically. References Further reading * Sabl, A.

Written by Chad I Ginsburg and Deron Miller, it was originally featured on the soundtrack to the 2010 film Jackass 3D, and was later included on the band's 2011 compilation album B-Sides & Rarities. The song is the band's first to feature Ginsburg on lead vocals, and it was released as a single on September 30, 2010. Origins and recording CKY first began working on \\"Afterworld\\" during recording sessions for the band's 2009 fourth studio album Carver City. The band's frontman Deron Miller originally wrote the music for the song and recorded the basic guitar riffs, although it was later shelved and not completed in time to be considered for inclusion on the album. During a later session in which the band was tasked with recording a song for inclusion on Jackass 3D, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wrote the lyrics (after watching an early screening of the film) and recorded the vocals and remaining instrumental parts for \\"Afterworld\\" while Miller was out of the studio buying food for the group. Composition and style Speaking about the themes of the song in a behind the scenes interview, Ginsburg explained that the majority of the lyrics were written in relation to \\"being a stuntman\\", in line with the content of the Jackass TV series and films. Miller added to this explanation by noting that Ginsburg and the band based the song on Jackass 3D and \\"tried to make it about just going for it ‚Äì in stunts and stuff like that\\". Ginsburg also revealed that the line \\"We'll never die in the afterworld\\" in the chorus was originally intended to be \\"We'll never die in the 3D world\\", although it was eventually changed due to the association with Jackass 3D being \\"overkill\\" according to Bam Margera. Release and reception \\"Afterworld\\" was first released as a digital download single on iTunes and Amazon.com on September 30, 2010 alongside an acoustic recording of Carver City closing track \\"Era of an End\\". After being featured in the film's closing credits, the track was later included on the Jackass 3D soundtrack on October 25. The following March, it was included as the opening track on the compilation album B-Sides & Rarities. Critical reception to \\"Afterworld\\" was mixed. Rick Florino of Artistdirect claimed that the song \\"elevates [CKY's] patented progressively pummeling hard rock into new sonic territory\\" and features \\"a combination of polyrhythmic riffing, searing lead lines and impassioned, infectious vocal delivery\\", while AllMusic's Jason Lymangrover criticised its inclusion on the Jackass 3D soundtrack. Music video The music video for \\"Afterworld\\" was directed by Bam Margera and released in July 2011 after the release of both the Jackass 3D soundtrack and B-Sides & Rarities. Filming for the video took place on November 15 and 16, 2010 at Philadelphia Soundstages in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In a 2015 interview, Deron Miller explained that he did not agree with the idea of producing a video for the single, describing it as a \\"bad idea\\" and noting that both he and drummer Jess Margera turned down appearing in the video. Speaking about the video itself, he revealed that he had only seen it once and condemned it as \\"cheesy and desperate\\". The video was dedicated to the memory of CKY Crew member and Jackass star Ryan Dunn, who died in a car crash on June 20, 2011. Speaking about the video at the time of its release, Jess Margera explained that the band chose to dedicate it to Dunn as the song features lyrics which were written about \\"not saying goodbye\\", and revealed that in Dunn's final text message to Bam he praised \\"Afterworld\\" as his favourite CKY music video.

The church is located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, United States and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Corpus Christi parish can trace its beginnings to a Mass that was held in the home of Michael Collins in 1855. At the time the Fort Dodge area was a part of the Diocese of Dubuque, which covered the state of Iowa. The parish was founded the following year and the Rev. John Vahey was sent as its first pastor. It was the first parish founded in what would become the Diocese of Sioux City. Priest from here would visit mission stations as far away as Emmetsburg, Spirit Lake and Sioux City well into the 1860s. with The first piece of property purchased for the parish was in 1857 at a cost of $200. The first church and rectory were built on the property the same year. The stone for the current church was quarried starting 1879 with construction starting the following year. It was designed by Dubuque architect Fridolin Heer, Sr., and local architect A.V. Lambert supervised construction. The church was completed in 1882, and dedicated on January 1, 1883. The Romanesque Revival structure cost $37,892.59 to construct. The convent, rectory and central heating plant were built between the years 1909 and 1932. In July 2000, Corpus Christi became part of a \\"team ministry\\" that brought together the five parishes in Webster County. In addition to Corpus Christi the parishes include: Sacred Heart and Holy Rosary in Fort Dodge, St. Matthew's in Clare, and St. Joseph's in Barnum. Architecture The main body of the church is a rectangular block that is six bays long and three bays wide. It measures , and its central bell tower rises to a height of . The locally quarried limestone is rusticated on the foundation, and smooth on the window caps and hoods. The locally produced brick forms the exterior of the structure. The gabled ends are stepped, and there is a corbel table at the eaves. The interior features three naves separated by columns, a rear gallery, and a skylight over the apse. Parochial School The parish school opened in 1859 during the pastorate of Father Marsh, although classes were being held prior to this time in the church. The first school building was a two-story structure with a cupola. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary taught in the school from 1862 to 1865. Lay teacher taught in the school from 1865 to 1873. The Sisters of Mercy were next to teach in Fort Dodge from 1873 to 1902. In 1900 Mother Mary Catherine discovered a fire that completely destroyed the school. \\"The Academy\\" of Corpus Christi Parish was opened in 1902. The new school was built for $20,000. The year it opened the Sisters of Charity BVM returned to the school and taught in Fort Dodge for the next 100 years. High school classes ended at Corpus Christi in 1956 when St. Edmond High School opened. The Academy building was torn down in 1975.

One of the wealthiest clubs in Argentina, Jockey Club counts more than 1,500 members, possessing its own horse racetrack and golf course in the Barrio Jard√≠n district. Some sports that can be practised at the club are basque pelota, billiards, field hockey, football, golf, handball, show jumping, swimming, and tennis. History In 1881, C√≥rdoba promulgated the first law that regulated horse racing. Six years later, Governor of C√≥rdoba, Jos√© Echenique, signed a decree establishing three races per year, in March, May and July. The decree also stated the sizes of prizes and the rules for competitors. In January 1887, \\"Jockey Club C√≥rdoba\\" was founded to encourage equestrianism in the province, just five years after its Buenos Aires' counterpart, as General Paz racecourse's resident horse racing club. In December, then President of Argentina, Miguel Ju√°rez Celman, during his visit to C√≥rdoba, attended the first races at the recently opened horse track, named \\"Hip√≥dromo Nacional\\". Along the years Jockey Club acquired new installations, including 65 hectares outside of the city. On this piece of land, nicknamed \\"country\\", a golf course would be built as well as fields to practice rugby union, field hockey, show jumping, polo, tennis and many other sports.Historia on JCC website Facilities The club has three facilities for the practise of sports and social activities: * Sede Centro: Where headquarters are also located, it was inaugurated in 1946. The installations include a gym, a restaurant, a library with a reading room, a dance hall and bars. * Country Deportivo: Where most of the sports are practised. The facility counts four show jumping tracks, seven rugby union fields, four hockey fields (2 of them with synthetic surface), three basque pelota courts, fifteen clay tennis courts, four show jumping courts and a gym. * Hip√≥dromo Barrio Jard√≠n: This is the horse racetrack of the club, which is also the only racetrack in the city of C√≥rdoba, it is located in the Barrio Jard√≠n district of C√≥rdoba. The building has four grandstands (one of them exclusively for members). One of the traditional races held there is the \\"Cl√°sico San Jer√≥nimo\\", established in 1940 and considered today one of the most important turf events in C√≥rdoba.\\"El cl√°sico San Jer√≥nimo est√° de cumple\\", La Voz del Interior , 2010-09-30 The facility has also an 18-hole golf course, built in 1997. Sports Apart from its equestrian activities, rugby union has been played at Jockey since the 1930s and today more than 600 players are registered with the club, making the institution one of the largest clubs of the Uni√≥n Cordobesa de Rugby. The team's historical rival is C√≥rdoba A.C. and to a lesser extent, Universitario. The senior rugby team plays in the Torneo de C√≥rdoba, the first division of the Uni√≥n Cordobesa league system. The club counts seven rugby fields in the Country Deportivo facility. Field hockey has been the most successful sport of the club, with 8 championships won by women's team and 7 titles won by men's section. Jockey Club counts more than 500 hockey players at all levels.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Its truncated spire is a landmark in the city centre. History The church was built in or around 1190. By 1203 it was known as \\"St. Nicholas of the Bridge at Gloucester\\". It was largely rebuilt in the 13th century, retaining some of its earlier features. Further alterations were made in the 15th century, and the west tower and spire were added. The spire was originally high. During the 16th century, the parish was the wealthiest in the city. The northeast vestry was extended in the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester in the Civil War the spire suffered a direct hit by cannon fire. It was reduced in height and capped in 1783 by John Bryan. In 1865 the church was restored by John Jaques and Son, and it was repaired following a fire in 1901. The tower was stabilized in 1927, and between 1935 and 1938 the north aisle was rebuilt and the church was re- roofed. After the church was closed in 1967,Jurica, John.

The church was declared redundant on 7 May 1971, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 25 June 1975. Architecture =Exterior= St Nicholas is constructed in limestone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave and a two-bay chancel. On the south side of the nave at its west end is a two- storey porch. To the east of this, extending from the third bay of the nave to the first bay of the chancel, is the south aisle, and to the east of this is a small porch leading to a priest's door. At the west end of the church is a tower with a truncated spire. On the north side, against the side of the tower is another porch. From the first to the fifth bay of the nave is the north aisle, and at its east end is a wider chapel, forming a transept. On the north side of the chancel is a vestry. The tower has diagonal corner buttresses, and is divided into three stages by string courses. There is a three-light window in each of the outer faces in the bottom stage, and also in all the faces of the middle stage. In the top stage are two-light bell openings on each side, flanked by niches. Above all these windows and bell openings are crocketed ogee gablets flanked by pinnacles; they all contain Perpendicular tracery. At the top of the tower is a battlemented parapet with pierced tracery panels, and pinnacles at the corners. Inset on the tower is an octagonal spire with a pinnacle attached to each of its diagonal faces. On each cardinal face is a two-light lucarne. The upper part of the spire has been removed and around its top is a pinnacled coronet. On the summit of the truncated spire is a lead ogee cap with ball finial. On the south side of the tower, between the bottom and middle stages is a clock carried on a bracket. The two-storey south porch is gabled and has an arched entrance containing iron gates. Inside the porch is a 12th-century arched doorway over which is a tympanum containing a carving depicting the Agnus Dei and foliage. The bays of the aisles are separated by buttresses, and each bay contains a three-light window. At the east end of the church is a five-light window with Perpendicular tracery. =Interior= Inside the tower is a lierne vault. The nave has an open timber roof. The details of the columns and arches of the arcades vary, some being Norman in style, and others Gothic. On the north and south walls of the chancel are squints, and on the south wall are a piscina and a credence table. The chancel is floored with encaustic tiles. At the east end of the south aisle is the former timber front of the west gallery, which had been installed there in 1621 and moved to this position in 1924. Over the south doorway are the Royal arms of Charles II. The remainder of the fittings date from the 19th century. The memorials include a chest tomb with coloured effigies of Alderman John Walton, who died in 1636, and his wife. The two-manual organ was built in 1831 by Gray and Davison, but was moved to St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester in 1972. There is a ring of six bells, the oldest two of which were cast in about 1499. The other bells are one cast in 1608 by John Baker, two in 1636 by Roger I Purdue, and one in 1725 by Abraham II Rudhall.

When his works were rediscovered in the early twentieth century, some scholars deemed his works to be ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù due to their extraordinary theological musings and schematic diagrams. The merits of this psychoanalytic interpretation, however, are currently under debate.  Biography  = Northern Italy (1296-1329) = Opicinus de Canistris World Map, 1296-1300 Opicinus was born December 24, 1296, in Lomello, near Pavia, Italy. His family, which was well known in Pavia, actively supported the Guelphs against the Ghibellines. He went to school from the age of six. He then studied liberal arts and progressively received an eclectic encyclopaedical training. From a very early age he was interested in drawing. He had several temporary jobs to materially help his family. The storming of Pavia by the Ghibellines on October 8, 1315 forced Canistris' family to take exile in Genoa for three years. Opicinus then distanced himself from the Guelph part of his family, especially following the death of his father and one of his younger brothers. In Genoa he studied theology and the Bible in greater depth and developed his talent for drawing. During this period he was able to see the first \\"sea maps\\" (incorrectly known as \\"portolans\\"). When he returned to Pavia in 1318, he studied to become a priest, and from 1319 he drew up religious treaties. He was ordained in Parma on February 27, 1320, and in 1323 obtained a modest parish in Pavia (Santa Maria Capella). Between 1325 and 1328, his autobiography doesn't mention any event. Towards the end of this period, he wrote a treatise defending the supremacy of the papacy over the Empire (De preeminentia spiritualis imperii) against the ecclesiological views of Marsilius of Padua, then a close adviser to the emperor elect Lewis of Bavaria in whose hands Pavia had fallen. It is probably this which lead him to leave the city, and find refuge in the nearby Piemontese city of Valenza in the summer of 1329. = Avignon (1329 ‚Äì circa 1353) = Cathedral of Pavia from manuscript Vatican, Pal. Lat. 1993, 1335‚Äì50 Diagram with Crucifixion, 1335‚Äì50During his stay in Valenza, he wrote a treatise on the issue of Christian poverty (which has not been preserved). Arrived in Avignon in April 1329, where the Papal Court was located he managed to present his treatise to Pope John XXII. Returning to Valenza, he revised the De preeminentia spiritualis imperii and submitted to the pope. While awaiting for some rewards for his efforts, Opicinus produced a description of the city of Pavia (De laudibus civitatis ticinensis). He eventually obtained a position as scribe at the Apostolic Penitentiary on December 4, 1330. However soon after, a suit was brought against him before the Rota, by the new bishop of Pavia, Giovanni Fulgosi, as part of a wider effort to reorganize the local clergy. Little is known about the suit, as in his writings, Opicinus is quite vague about its nature. = Illness and visions = On March 31, 1334 Opicinus suffered a serious illness in which he became comatose for nearly two weeks. When he recovered, he discovered that much of his memory was gone, that he could not speak and that his right hand was useless. He wrote, Ultimately, Opicinus did recover his memory, speech and some function in his hand. He attributed this healing to a vision he experienced on August 15 (coincidentally the date of the feast of the assumption of the Virgin). Opicinus believed that his illness was the result of hidden sins that had corrupted his body. However, he interpreted his recovery as spiritual gift that allowed him to reveal spiritual truth. The ‚Äúpictures‚Äù he refers to are a complex series of maps and schematic diagrams in two manuscripts currently held at the Vatican library, Palatinus 1993 and Vaticanus 6435. These drawings were a means for Opicinus to chart the spiritual realities that he believed were the underpinnings of the physical world. Much scholarship has interpreted Opicinus‚Äôs illness as psychosomatic, specifically the product of schizophrenia. however, whatever symptomotology can be gleaned from Opicinus‚Äôs abstruse writings seems to suggest that he suffered a stroke in addition to potential psychotic episodes. He died in Avignon around 1353.  Works  = Writings prior to 1334 = These are treaties without drawings and known by the authors friends.

The Vaticanus latinus 6435 manuscript  Vatican Lat. 6435 folio 79v. Opicinus wrote the Vaticanus latinus between June and November 1337 and subsequently inserted addita (the last in December 1352). This manuscript, which was only identified on the eve of World War II, was recently fully published and translated by the medievalist Muriel Laharie as well as several studies by the psychiatrist Guy Roux ‚Äì a multi-disciplinary collaboration essential to examining this singular work. The Vaticanus comes in the form of a paper codex with 87 folios, with only written text in the first half, text and drawings (often map based) in the second half. It is a very dense document. This codex looks similar to a journal written in chronological order. However its polymorphous content which is difficult to decipher bears witness to the encyclopaedic culture of its author. Opicinus used all his knowledge to construct a cosmic identity appearing in numerous guises; he is God, the Sun, the Pope, Europe, Avignon, etc. Its colour anthropomorphic maps of the Mediterranean area, precise and curiously organised, illustrate \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters and animals on which he projects himself and his enemies. The use of symbols, his taste for dissimulating and manipulating (words, numbers, space), and his attraction to the obscene and scatological are omnipresent and relate strongly to similar themes found broadly in medieval culture.  The Palatinus latinus 1993 manuscript  The Palatinus latinus, first identified in 1913, was the subject of a study by Richard Salomon in 1939, with a partial edition of the document and comments. With 52 large colour drawings on parchment (often used on both sides) and covered with notes, Palatinus, 1993 apparently relies much less on a cartographic format ; yet, invislbe maps of the Mediterranean are underlying most of the diagrams, with sometimes only a few places expressed. The drawings are extremely schematic, using human figures covered in circles and ellipses. Opicinus also included a plethora of biblical quotations, calendars, astrological charts and medical imagery. Some scholars (M. Laharie and G. Roux) claim that these drawings were produced later than the Vaticanus, with no firm basis. Only two diagrams are dated or connected to the 1350 Jubilee. Other evidences rather point to an early production of most of the other drawings, in 1335 or 1336, before the Vaticanus.

It was built in 1926 and was for decades Dallas' second- tallest, as the city was growing into the largest inland cotton market in the U.S. By 1971, though the city had become the financial capital of the cotton industry, the exchange housed more Baptists than brokers because of offices rented to nearby First Baptist Church. By 1987 the building sat vacant.Brannen Vick, Frances \\"Dallas grew into largest inland cotton market in the U.S.\\", The Dallas Morning News, April 30, 2010. Foreclosure and demolition New owner James Louis Williams purchased the Cotton Exchange Building in 1985 and planned to tear it down to build a new 52-story tower in its place. But due to the savings and loan crisis that began in the late 1980s, Williams ended up in bankruptcy court, which in 1991 cut his debt on the structure from $15 million to $9.9 million. Meanwhile, the original lender on the building, First RepublicBank Corp., had failed in 1988, sending the loan to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. In 1991, demolition crews were hired to implode the structure.Wrolstad, Mark \\"Falling monument - Planned Cotton Exchange demolition raises questions on issue of preservation\\", The Dallas Morning News, June 23, 1994. City inspectors determined that the Cotton Exchange's precast concrete panels, attached during a 1960s renovation, had a high asbestos content and should be removed before implosion. When these were removed, it was discovered that the building's original 1926 exterior was intact and efforts were initiated to save the building from implosion. Then- Mayor Steve Bartlett attempted to persuade Mr. Williams to seek a buyer who would convert the offices to apartments, but the Dallas City Council did not pass enhanced tax abatements for inner-city housing renovations until October 1993, too late to stop the process.

The C&E; Branch flag Location The unit is currently located at Major Edward James Gibson Holland VC Armoury at 2100 Walkley Road, Ottawa, Ontario. History 33 Signal Regiment began on 12 October 1922 as the 3rd Battalion, Canadian Corps of Signals. It was redesignated as the 3rd Divisional Signals Regiment in 1926 and was divided into signal companies for the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions in the Second World War. Following the war it became the 3rd Signal Regiment until 1970 when it was allocated to Canadian Forces Communication Command (authorized on 1 April 1965) and redesignated as 703 Communication Regiment. Its mandate was to provide operationally trained communications personnel and to support the Regular Force in ongoing peacetime tasks and activities. On 1 June 1976 the unit was renamed 763 (Ottawa) Communication Regiment. The newly formed 76 Communication Group took command of 763 Communication Regiment from 70 Communication Group on 1 April 1977. The Regiment was housed at Wallis House Armoury in Ottawa and its support services were provided by CFB Ottawa. In the summer of 2010 it was renamed 33 Signal Regiment following its entrance into 33 Canadian Brigade Group (CBG). 33 Signal Regiment specializes in tactical and strategic communication, employing voice, electronic and telecommunication systems. Their mandate is to provide individual and collective support to Canadian Forces operations, both domestic and international. Many of their members have served in various UN and NATO peacekeeping missions around the world. This unit also provides communication support to the Army Reserve. Some units in the Communication Reserve also provide manning support to the Navy Transportable Tactical Command Centres. Regimental badge 33 Signal Regiment Badge On 15 June 2017, the new badge for 33 Signal Regiment was granted by the Governor General. 763 Communication Regiment Badge In July 1982, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth approved a regimental badge having a right arm rising from three rivers; the Ottawa, Gatineau, and the Rideau, the definition used by the local indigenous inhabitants for identifying the locality. The trees acknowledge the importance of logging, the original commerce of the area. Combined, they reflect the traditional source of unit members as the Ottawa Valley. The arm holds a single reflex bow to show the operational environment. A double curve motif formed from a two- string wampum completes the design. In Algonquin legend, such a motif exuded power that could be oriented inwards, such as seen on women's and children's clothing to protect the wearer, or outwards as a way to transmit the bearer's power to others, not as electromagnetic energy (as we do today) but as an intangible such as information, providing the recipient with the power of knowledge. It also forms the figure \\"3\\", significant through the unit's history. String wampum was used by natives to pass messages, with the rarer purple beads being for the important parts, and the white beads for the rest. A such, it was a primitive version of encryption, and the reason that all messengers found with one were tortured: it was important. The motto, ', is Algonquin for \\"anyplace, anytime\\". The overall design is, from the Ottawa, secure communications for others, anywhere, anytime. The Algonquin had no word for \\"where\\": they used \\"place\\". Training Training is a year-round activity and soldiers are expected to attend up to two weekend training activities per month. Training is conducted at E.J.G. Holland VC Armoury and other locations. Once fully trained, soldiers can apply for various full-time and part-time employment opportunities available throughout the year. Peacetime activity The regiment is not without distinction, having won the Malloch Trophy, symbolic of the best signals unit in Canada, both pre and post-war more than any other unit in the history of the competition. The regimental unit has served in most places the Canadian Forces are stationed across the nation and on deployed operations including Bosnia, East-Timor, Israel (Golan Heights), United Arab Emirates, Egypt (Sinai Peninsula), Afghanistan (Kabul, Kandahar & MazƒÅr-i-Sharƒ´f), Kuwait & Latvia. The regiment has a strong history of supporting domestic operations ranging from Operation Recuperation in 1998 (North American ice storm of 1998), to Operation Abacus in 1999 (Y2K), Operation Nanook (annual summer northern sovereignty operations),Operation Nunalivut (annual winter northern sovereignty operations), Operation Cadence in 2010 (support to the G8/G20 Leader's Summit), Operation Provision in 2016 (support of the 25,000 Syrian Refugees resettlement) & Operation Lentus in 2017 (support of record flooding in Eastern Ontario and western Quebec). The regiment has also shown continued support to local community and charity events such as the Scott Tokessy Baseball Tournament, the Canadian Blood Services Blood Bank, the Ottawa Food Bank and, most notably for 25 years till 2016 providing communications links and a safety presence for the Canadian Ski Marathon.

She founded the Anita Bush All-Colored Dramatic Stock Company in 1915, a pioneering black repertory theatre company that helped launch the careers of Charles Gilpin, Dooley Wilson, Evelyn Preer and others. Biography Anita Bush was born on September 1, 1883, in Washington, DC. When she was three years old, she was brought to Brooklyn, New York, by her father, master tailor Chapman Bush, ‚Äúa theatrical costumer whose clients included many New York actors and performers‚Äù. She grew up spending many hours working alongside her father, and delivered costumes to the theaters. She was exposed to legitimate shows in theaters where blacks were not allowed, and to many white theater actors and actresses. While working with her father, she also she acted alongside her sister in Antony and Cleopatra, which inspired her to pursue a career in the theater. While working with her father at the Bijou Theater, she saw the company of Bert Williams and George Walker performing In Dahomey. It was during this time that she asked her father for permission to audition for the group, in hopes to gain a career in acting. At the age of 17, she was cast with the company and it allowed her to tour the world and pave a way for her to form her own companies. With the Bijou Theater Company, she ‚Äútraveled to England with the musical and later performed in the Chorus of four other Williams and Walker shows‚Äù. After performing in her final play titled, Mr. Lode of Koal with the troop, she went on to form her own dance group. The dance group was called the ‚ÄúAnita Bush and her 8 Shimmy Babies‚Äù. Unfortunately, at the break of her career she had to stop dancing due to a back injury, which then inspired her to pursue a full-time career in theater drama. Career In the early part of the 20th century, Bush worked extensively as a dancer in musical theatre and vaudeville performing with the likes of Williams and Walker Co.. While working with Maria C. Downs she put on vaudeville acts and plays. With a signed contract with Elmore, Bush went to Billie Burke, a Harlem-based white director/playwright to stage his play, The Girl at the Fort, a light comedy with five characters. Bush then assembled the cast which included Carlotta Freeman, Dooley Wilson and Andrew Bishop. The play opened at the Lincoln Theatre in November 1915. For the next six weeks, Bush's company presented a different play every two weeks to much success. The Anita Bush Stock Company presented a one-act play titled The Girl at the Fort. The success of Maria C. Downs and Bush's team allowed them to generate more revenue and popularity. At this point, Maria C. Downs asked Bush to change the name of her company from the Anita Bush Stock Company to the Lincoln Players. However, when Maria C. Downs, the owner of the theatre, insisted that the name of her company be changed to the Lincoln Players. Bush's response to the request was, ‚Äú‚Ä¶[she] moved her company to the Lafayette Theater to open with a sketch entitled Over the Footlights‚Äù. Anita Bush and The Lafayette Players The Lafayette Players Stock Company was owned by Anita Bush in the early 1900s. In 1915, she presented the idea of launching a dramatic stock company to Eugene \\"Frenchy\\" Elmore, the assistant manager of the Lincoln Theatre, an established vaudeville house in the Harlem section of New York City. Although her company had not yet been established, she convinced Elmore that she could mount a production in just two weeks. In March 1916, the Lafayette Theatre purchased the rights to her company and changed the name to the Lafayette Players. Bush then organized four additional companies of the Lafayette Players which toured throughout the United States. At the Lafayette Theatre, the Anita Bush Stock Company would mount a new play on a weekly basis. Throughout the Lafayette Players lifetime with Bush, she reached a point where she could no longer afford the group and sold her right to her ‚Äúcomanager‚Äù. Lester Walton. Even though she no longer managed the Players, she is credited with the responsibility of their reputation. As a faithful member she remained with them until 1920. During this year she left the company to pursue a career in motion pictures. In 1921, she appeared in The Bull-Dogger, the first of two Norman Film Company productions starring Bill Pickett. The following year she was featured in The Crimson Skull. Anita Bush died in her Bronx, NY home on February 16, 1974, at the age of 90.

It lived in what is now Peru during the Late Eocene, around 36 million years ago. A nearly complete skeleton was discovered in 2008 and includes fossilized feathers, the first known in penguins. A study of the melanosomes, pigment-containing organelles within the feathers, indicated that they were gray or reddish brown. This differs from modern penguins, which get their dark black-brown feathers from unique melanosomes that are large and ellipsoidal.  Etymology  The genus name derives from the Quechua words Inka for emperor or king and yacu for water; \\"Water King\\". The specific epithet refers to Paracas, where the fossils were found.  Description  Although it was an early penguin, Inkayacu closely resembled its modern relatives. It had paddle-like wings with short feathers, and a very long bill. Inkayacu, along with other extinct penguins from Peru, are often referred to as giant penguins because of their large size. Inkayacu was about long, in contrast to the largest living penguin, the emperor penguin, which is about long. The melanosomes within the feathers of Inkayacu are long and narrow, similar to most other birds. Their shape suggests that Inkayacu had grey and reddish-brown feathering across its body. Most modern penguins have melanosomes that are about the same length as those of Inkayacu, but are much wider. There is also a greater number of them within living penguins' cells. The shape of these melanosomes gives them a dark brown or black color, and is the reason why modern penguins are mostly black and white. Despite not having the distinctive melanosomes of modern penguins, the feathers of Inkayacu were similar in many other ways. The melanosomes within the feathers provides both color and wear resistance. The feathers that made up the body contour of the bird have large shafts, and the primaries along the edge of the wings are short and undifferentiated. Supporting Online Material The nanostructure of penguin feathers was modified after earlier macrostructural modifications of the feather shape that has been linked to aquatic flight.  Discovery  Map of the Paracas National Reservation in Ica, Peru, where remains of Inkayacu have been found. Fossils of Inkayacu were first found in 2008 on the Pacific coast of Ica, Peru. A nearly complete skeleton was uncovered from the Otuma Formation,Inkayacu at Fossilworks.org in the Paracas National Reserve by an expedition team led by Rodolfo Salas and studied by a team led by Julia Clarke of the University of Texas. This had been the first recovered fossil with feathers attached to it. The feathers were well enough preserved that researchers Julia Clarke, Liliana D'Alba and Ali J. Altamirano were able to perform analysis of melanosomes. Until now, without the addition of feathers, there has not been any research conducted on the nanostructure of ancient feathers. Large penguins, including the species Perudyptes devriesi and Icadyptes salasi, had been described from the area the previous year. The first evidence of melanosomes in fossilized feathers was published in late 2008, being reported from an Early Cretaceous bird. Paleontologist Jakob Vinther, an author of the 2007 paper on the first fossilized melanosomes known, found melanosomes in the feathers of Inkayacu soon after the fossil was discovered. This discovery gives insight into how the evolutionary history of Inkayacu has affected the morphology of its extant descendants.  Paleobiology  Inkayacu inhabited a sea that existed in Peru during the Late Eocene. Paddle-like limbs enabled an aquatic lifestyle. The large tightly packed melanosomes within the cells of living penguins gives the feathers added rigidity, which may be an adaptation for coping with the stresses of underwater flight. Because Inkayacu has smaller and fewer melanosomes, it may not have been able to swim very deep, possibly remaining near the surface. However, it is also possible that the melanosomes of modern penguins do not give them an advantage underwater, since the feathers on their undersides are primarily white, lacking the rigidity of melanin. If melanin is present in the feathers to add rigidity, it would be expected that all feathers on living penguins would be black.

The commission was mandated to investigate the facts and circumstances which led to the failure of the ceasefire agreement made operational on 27 February 2002, the lessons that should be learnt from those events and the institutional, administrative and legislative measures which need to be taken in order to prevent any recurrence of such concerns in the future, and to promote further national unity and reconciliation among all communities. After an 18-month inquiry, the commission submitted its report to the President on 15 November 2011. The report was made public on 16 December 2011, after being tabled in the parliament. The commission concluded that the Sri Lankan military didn't deliberately target civilians but the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) repeatedly violated international humanitarian law. According to the commission the military gave the \\"highest priority\\" to protecting civilians whereas the Tamil Tigers had had \\"no respect for human life\\". The commission admitted that civilians had been killed by the Sri Lankan military, albeit accidentally, contradicting the government's line that there were zero civilian casualties. The commission did, however, receive some eyewitness evidence alleging abuse by the military which warranted further investigation and, if necessary, the prosecution of perpetrators. The commission acknowledged that hospitals had been shelled, resulting \\"considerable civilian casualties\\", but it did not say who was responsible for the shelling. The commission blamed Sinhalese and Tamil politicians for causing the civil war: the Sinhalese politicians failed to offer a solution acceptable to the Tamil people and the Tamil politicians fanned militant separatism. The commission has been heavily criticised by international human rights groups, the UN Panel of Experts and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses. These critics believed that the Sri Lankan government was using the commission as a tool to prevent an independent international investigation of alleged abuses. As a consequence of this Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group refused to appear before the commission. Background Tensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities in Sri Lanka turned into a full-scale war between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE in 1983. In 2002, government and the LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. After a violent last few months, in May 2009, the government killed LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared an end to the civil war. Following the end of the war, international pressure mounted on the government to inquire into the final stages of the civil war, in which it was alleged thousands of civilians, possibly as many as 40,000, were killed. Over the course of the entire war, between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths. There were calls to look into the root causes of the civil war and meaningful reconciliation. The Sri Lankan government rejected calls for an independent international inquiry but instead on 15 May 2010, nearly a year after the end of the civil war, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission to look back at the conflict Sri Lanka suffered for 26 years. Its secretariat was established at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies in Colombo. Hearings of the commission, which commenced on 11 August 2010, were public and open to media, unless the witness requested otherwise. The LLRC issued some interim recommendations on 13 September 2010. Time limit to produce the final report was extended twice, until 15 November 2011. Hearings were held in Colombo and in former conflict affected areas such as Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Vavuniya. Field visits were conducted to the former war zone and detention centres where surrendered Tamil Tiger combatants were held. After analysing over 1,000 oral and 5,000 written submissions it had received, the commission presented its 388-page final report to the President on 15 November 2011. It was made public on 16 December 2011. Mandate The mandate of the LLRC was as follows: \\"To inquire and report on the following matters that may have taken place during the period between 21 February 2002 and 19 May 2009, namely: * The facts and circumstances which led to the failure of the ceasefire agreement operationalized on 21 February 2002 and the sequence of events that followed thereafter up to the 19th of May, 2009. * Whether any person, group or institution directly or indirectly bear responsibility in this regard; * The lessons we would learn from those events and their attendant concern, in order to ensure that there will be no recurrence; * The methodology whereby restitution to any person affected by those events or their dependants or their heirs, can be affected; * The institutional administrative and legislative measured which need to be taken in order or prevent any recurrence of such concerns in the future, and to promote further national unity and the reconciliation among all communities, and to make any such other recommendations with reference to any of the matters that have been inquired into under the terms of the Warrant.\\" Members The LLRC's eight members were: *1.

Interim recommendations In September 2010 the LLRC published its interim recommendations: * A special mechanism should be created to examine the cases of long term detainees on a case-by-case basis; * A list of names of those in detention be published; * Released detainees should be issued with a certificate of discharge so that they are not taken into custody again; * Delays in the legal system should be looked into; * The government should issue a clear policy statement that private land will not be used for government backed settlements; * Illegal armed groups be disarmed (high priority); * Immediate steps be taken so that the public can communicate with officials and receive documents in a language that they understand; * Free movement on the A9 highway should be encouraged; and * There should be better coordination and communication between government agents and the security forces in normalising civil administration. The report =Summary= The report provides a detailed analysis of the oral and written representations made to the commission. The 1st chapter gives an introduction to the report and the methodology the commission has used. 2nd chapter is devoted to the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement (CFA). There the commission analyses its background, political and security dimensions and the impact. The commission also tries to evaluate the CFA's effectiveness and the causes which led to its eventual collapse. The next chapter provides an insight into the security forces operations in Eastern and Wanni theaters, with a note about the casualty figures of both security forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Chapter 4 deals with the Humanitarian law issues pertaining to the conflict. This includes hundreds of eyewitness reports and clarifications of the incidents brought to light. There is also an evaluation of the Sri Lanka experience in the context of allegations of violations of International humanitarian law (IHL). Here, the commission concludes that security forces had not deliberately targeted civilians during the final stages of war, but civilian casualties had occurred under unavoidable circumstances. The commission also casts doubts about the authenticity of Channel 4 videos. Chapter 5 deals with the human rights issues arising from the conflict. It analyses the alleged \\"white van\\" abductions, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detention and involuntary disappearances. This chapter goes into details of the instances where such incidents have occurred, and places the blame on certain paramilitary groups who allegedly hold the responsibility. Next 2 chapters are devoted to land issues regarding the returning Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and restitution/compensatory relief paid out to persons who are affected by the conflict. Chapter 8 talks about the post war reconciliation and alleviating the grievances of affected groups, especially the Sri Lankan Tamil people, in broad terms. The ninth and the final chapter summarizes the principle observations and recommendations made by the commission.http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/LLRC-REPORT.pdf =Observations= *The 2002 ceasefire agreement (CFA) which was signed between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE, although brought about a short lived respite to the country, was unstable and eventually unproductive. *Conceptual flaws and the untenable dual roles of the Government of Norway, as facilitator of the peace process and the head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission paved the way to its failure. *The military strategy of the Sri Lanka Armed Forces during Eelam War IV is satisfactory. It gave the highest priority to the protection of civilian population. *Security Forces had not deliberately targeted civilians in the No Fire Zones (NFZs), which were declared in the final stages of the war. *Given the complexity of the situation and based on the Principle of Proportionality, commission concluded that the Security Forces were confronted with an unprecedented situation where no other choice was possible other than returning fire into the NFZs in reply to the incoming fire, and all \\"feasible precautions\\" that were practicable in the circumstances had been taken. Determining and obtaining of a re- construction of all the conditions under which the \\"combat action\\" took place would be \\"next to impossible\\". *The Commission is satisfied, on a careful consideration of all the circumstances that shells had in fact fallen on hospitals causing damage and resulting in civilian casualties. But evidence submitted is equivocal in nature and does not warrant a definitive conclusion that one party or the other was responsible for the shelling. *Government of Sri Lanka with the co-operation of the aid agencies, has taken all possible steps in getting food, medical supplies and other essential items across to the entrapped civilians. However, there appears to have been a paucity of medicines and the medical facilities appear to have been inadequate. *LTTE was engaged in grave violations of core principles of International humanitarian law (IHL) by using civilians as human shields, placing and using military equipment in civilian centres, shooting at civilians trying to escape into safe areas, conscripting young children to engage in combat etc. *Absence of a proper verification process during the final stages of the war has contributed to the unverified sweeping generalizations of a highly speculative nature, as regards casualty figures. *There are a number of shortcomings in the existing IHL regime pertaining to internal conflicts involving states and non state armed groups. *Technical ambiguities, electronic tampering and the artificial construction of the 'blood effect' in the 3 separate videos (originally in 3GP format) that appears in Channel 4 documentary Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, cast significant doubts on their authenticity, leading to questions on whether the incidents are 'real' or 'staged'. *There was an alarmingly large number of representations made in front of the commission alleging abductions, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detention and involuntary disappearances, regarding which no official action has been taken. *Programmes in rehabilitation centers for ex-LTTE combatants are conducted in a professional and caring manner. *The grievances of the Tamil community has been a root cause for the ethnic conflict. *Along with an independent judiciary and a transparent legal process, strict adherence to the rule of law is a sine qua non for peace and stability of the country. *An independent and permanent Police Commission is a pre-requisite to guarantee the effective functioning of the Police service. *While the distribution of meaningful powers to the periphery is essential, there are powers which form the core responsibilities of the state and which cannot be so devolved, and need to be retained and exercised by the government at the centre. =Recommendations= *Further investigations should be carried out regarding four particular incidents which caused death or injury to civilians, on possible implication of the security forces. *Necessary investigations should be carried out into specific allegations of disappearances after surrender/arrest, and where such investigations produce evidence of any unlawful act on the part of individual members of the Army, the wrongdoers should be prosecuted and punished. *Take due account on surrendered LTTE cadres against whom investigations reveal prima facie material for prosecution. *IHL regime should take into account the grey areas in the existing legal framework applicable to internal conflicts involving states and non state armed groups. *A professionally designed household survey should be conducted covering all affected families in all parts of the island to ascertain firsthand the scale and the circumstances of death and injury to civilians, as well as damage to property during the period of the conflict. *Institute an independent investigation into Channel 4 videos. *A special commissioner should be appointed to investigate alleged disappearances and provide material to the Attorney general to initiate criminal proceedings as appropriate. *Death certificates should be issued and monetary recompense should be provided where necessary. Steps should be taken to effectively implement the amendment to the Registration of Deaths Act (2006). *Appoint an independent advisory committee to monitor and examine detention and arrest of persons under any regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance or the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). *Domestic legislation should be framed to specifically criminalize enforced or involuntary disappearances. *Prepare a centralized and comprehensive database containing a list of detainees and make that available to their next of kin. *All illegal armed groups should be disarmed. *Grant the legal ownership of land to those who have been resettled. *In instances where there is prima facie evidence of conscription of children as combatants (by both LTTE and TMVP), any such alleged cases should be investigated and offenders must be brought to justice. *Increased employment opportunities should be provided to those in the former conflict affected areas. *An inter-agency task force mandated to addressing the needs of vulnerable groups like women, children, elderly and disabled, must be established. *Investigate and inquire into alleged incidents of serious violations of human rights including the 2006 Trincomalee massacre and the 2006 massacre of 17 aid workers. *The land policy of the governments should not be an instrument to effect unnatural changes in the demographic pattern of a given province. *A National Land Commission (NLC) should be established in order to propose appropriate future national land policy guidelines. *All political parties should arrive at a bipartisan understanding on national land policy and recognize it as a national issue. Land policy should not be used as a tool to gain narrow political advantage. *The role and capacity of the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority (REPPIA) should be reviewed, giving its primary focus in providing compensatory relief for persons affected by the conflict. Ex-LTTE combatants and next of kin should also be considered eligible for compensatory relief. *Involvement of the security forces in civilian activities in North Eastern Province should be phased out. Private lands should be used giving reasonable time lines. *A proper investigation should be carried out on the alleged involvement of Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman and Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan in the 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers. *A full investigation should be done on the alleged acts of extortion committed by members of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP). *Steps should be taken to neutralise the activities of a gang led by a person called Major Seelan in connection with offences of abduction, extortion and robbery using the security forces facilities as a cover. *Units of the Attorney General's department should be set up in the provinces to guide and advise the Police regarding criminal investigations, prosecutions and other matters touching upon the criminal justice system. *An independent Public Service Commission should be established without delay to ensure that there is no political interference in the public service. *A good-faith effort should be taken to develop a consensus on power devolution, building on what exists ‚Äì both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery, as well as power sharing at the centre. *Learning of each other's languages should be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum. *All Government offices should have Tamil-speaking officers at all times. Police Stations should have bi-lingual officers on a 24-hour basis. *A proactive policy should be implemented to encourage mixed schools serving children from different ethnic and religious backgrounds. *Government should engage with the so-called 'hostile diaspora groups' constructively and address their concerns. *National anthem should be sung simultaneously in two languages to the same tune. *Laws should be strictly enforced on the instances of hate speech that contributes to communal disharmony. *A separate event should be set apart on the National Day (4 February) to express solidarity and empathy with all victims of the tragic conflict and pledge the collective commitment to ensure that there should never be such blood-letting in the country again. =Figures= *Casualty figure of Sri Lanka armed forces during the Eelam War IV, from 26 July 2006 (operation to recapture of the Mavil Aru reservoir), to 18 May 2009 (formal declaration of the cessation of hostilities), stands at 5,556 killed, 28,414 wounded and 169 missing in action. *During the same period, LTTE had lost 22,247 cadres of which 11,812 had been identified by name. Among the combatants identified by name, 4,264 belonged to the period from January 2009 to May 2009. *Civilian officials who made representations to the commission indicated that they were not in a position, under the circumstances of conflict, to carry out any assessment of civilian casualties. Consequently, no estimated or verified figures of civilian casualties are available in the report. *Records of the Ministry of Health indicates that from January to June 2009, government hospitals in the Northern Province have recorded 1,353 deaths after admission. Further 106 deaths of patients happened after being transferred to hospitals outside the conflict area. Vavuniya Base Hospital has registered a total of 870 deaths during the same period. Of these, 257 deaths have been registered as due to firearm and blast injuries. *Report points out 474 instances of involuntary disappearances since 2006. Implementation In October 2010 the government established the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee headed by the then attorney general Mohan Peiris to implement the LLRC's interim recommendations. However, the recommendations remain largely unimplemented. The LLRC's final report admits that there had been no progress in the implementation of its interim recommendations. On March 13, 2012, the Sri Lankan government released a statement on the formulation of an action plan to implement the recommendations of LLRC. According to a study by the Colombo-based think tank Verit√© Research, only 20 percent of the commission‚Äôs 189 actionable recommendations have been implemented, with 57% of the cases being described as \\"partial implementation\\" and 22% of the cases being described as \\"poor\\" in progress. Criticism of commission The LLRC has been criticized by international human rights groups, the UN Panel of Experts and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses. These critics argued that the commission was primarily set up to examine the failure of the 2002 ceasefire and had no explicit mandate to examine the alleged war crimes committed by both sides during the final months of the civil war. But the Sri Lankan government rejected the UN's war report calling it \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and \\"patently biased\\". According to criticism, previous commissions of inquiry established by the Sri Lankan government had failed to achieve anything other than delaying criminal investigations and had been plagued by government interference. Amnesty International has condemned the commission as \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and unable to provide accountability for alleged atrocities. Amnesty claimed that the LLRC was a ploy by the Sri Lankan government to prevent an independent international investigation and that it would never deliver justice, truth and full reparations for the war victims. Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed that the commission was an inadequate response to the many serious allegations of wartime abuses; explaining that it lacked independence and a proper mandate; its members weren't impartial or competent; it failed to provide adequate and effective protection for witnesses; it didn't have adequate resources; and that the government wouldn't give serious consideration to the commission's recommendations. The International Crisis Group (ICG) claimed that the flawed LLRC would neither provide accountability nor reconciliation. As a consequence of the above concerns Amnesty, HRW and ICG announced in October 2010 that they had declined to appear before the \\"fundamentally flawed\\" commission. The independence of the commission has been questioned due to the fact its members were appointed by the Sri Lankan government, one of the parties accused of committing war crimes. Most of its members were retired senior government employees. Some even held senior government positions during the final stages of the war when they publicly defended the conduct of the government and military against allegations of war crimes. H. M. G. S. Palihakkara, who was Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, represented the government and defended the actions of the Sri Lankan military during the final months of the civil war. A. Rohan Perera was legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry during the period investigated by the LLRC. The chair C. R. De Silva was Attorney-General from April 2007 to December 2008 and as such was the most senior law officer with responsibility for many of the issues brought before the LLRC. Silva was accused of interfering in a previous commission, the 2006-2009 Presidential Commission of Inquiry into allegations of serious human rights violations by the security forces. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, who had been invited by the President to oversee the Commission‚Äôs work, resigned in April 2008 citing De Silva's behaviour as one of major reasons for doing so. The commission was seen as a tool to discredit the opposition United National Party whose leader Ranil Wickramasinghe was Prime Minister when the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE was signed in 2002. The BBC was banned from covering the proceeding. Reaction to report =Sri Lanka= The report was generally received well within Sri Lanka, although some aspects of the report were criticized by various political groups and figures. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest political party representing the Sri Lankan Tamils, criticised the report for categorically failing to \\"effectively and meaningfully deal with issues of accountability\\" and called its findings an offence against the dignity of the war victims. The TNA has called on the international community to establish a \\"mechanism for accountability\\" in order to bring to book the perpetrators of war crimes. In an interview with The Sunday Leader TNA leader R. Sampanthan expressed his disappointment of the report stating: \\"on the particular issue of accountability with regard to violation of international humanitarian laws and international human rights laws by the Sri Lankan Government.\\" He also said that the report has not done justice for the many thousands of victims of the war. According to TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran the LLRC had contradicted itself by maintaining that it had no mandate to investigate into any incident and yet clearing of the armed forces of deliberately targeting civilians. ‚ÄúHow can the LLRC come to such a conclusion without investigating into the matter‚Äù, Sumanthiran queried. The TNA subsequently issued a 115-page analytical response to the LLRC report in which it concluded that the LLRC had \\"failed to fulfill the expectations of the Tamil community\\" and that it did \\"not address important questions of accountability; was designed to shield civilian and military leaders responsible for serious crimes from blame; and evinces the Sri Lankan State‚Äôs unwillingness to acknowledge and address issues of accountability\\". The report went on to urge the international community to acknowledge that the domestic accountability mechanisms had consistently failed and to \\"take steps to establish an international mechanism for accountability\\". Jathika Hela Urumaya, a Sinhalise national group, claimed that LLRC had over passed their mandate and had failed to look into the 9,878 civil assassinations carried out by the LTTE. Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, former Sri Lankan ambassador to France, commenting on the report stated \\"Though not without flaws and lacuna, LLRC report does not disappoint, and reaches high standards, ranking with the best reports emanating over the decades from official and semi-official/autonomous Sri Lankan commissions, reviews and probes. It is a serious, thoughtful, carefully written and constructed text, striking in its fair-mindedness and balance. It deserves constructive engagement with, by all concerned Sri Lankan citizens and those in the world community who are concerned about and with Sri Lanka.\\" He pointed out two factual inaccuracies in the report. The first one being that the 2002 CFA was the result and in the context of the military weakness of the Sri Lankan state. He explained, this had in fact not been the case as at that time, LRRP missions were taking down the Tiger command structure and followed and not preceded the disastrous Agni Kheela operation and the devastating Bandaranaike Airport attack. Second one is that LLRC Report draws a veil of silence over the lopsided post-tsunami relief mechanism (PTOMS) which was negotiated at the tail end of the presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga. Editorial of \\"The Island\\" ‚Äî the Sri Lankan English language daily ‚Äî named \\"LLRC shows the way\\" (19 December 2011) compared the LLRC report with the Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka saying, \\"Unlike the UN Secretary General's advisory panel which took cover behind a wall of secrecy and hurriedly put together a report of sorts-- which has been made out to be a UN document--based on mere unsubstantiated allegations and LTTE propaganda, the LLRC has ensured transparency in the process of inquiry and presented both sides of the story complete with its observations and recommendations.\\" Editorial of \\"The Sunday Times\\" ‚Äî the Sri Lankan English language daily ‚Äî named \\"Heed LLRC's call to save Rule of Law\\" noted that while \\"the commission was not something the Government had in mind in the flush of its military victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009\\", it \\"quite correctly placed much of the blame for this polarization on politicians who were looking to bolster their vote base by whipping up the communal drum\\". It also stated that \\"This LLRC report is not to be taken lightly due to both international and domestic pressure for good governance. This report is in a completely different league.\\" =International= \\\\- Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd issued a statement on 13 February 2012 welcoming the report's recommendations but expressing concern that it failed \\"to fully address alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law\\". The statement noted that Australia had consistently called on Sri Lanka to \\"investigate all allegations of crimes committed by both sides to the conflict, including those raised in the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts report\\" but that the LLRC report had failed to \\"comprehensively address such allegations\\". As such the Australian government continues to call on Sri Lanka to investigate all such allegations \\"in a transparent and independent manner\\". The statement urged the Sri Lankan government to \\"set clear, firm timeframes\\" for the implementation of the report's recommendations. \\\\- Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird issued a statement on 11 January 2012 strongly urging the Sri Lankan government to implement the report's recommendations but expressing concern \\"that the report does not fully address the grave accusations of serious human rights violations that occurred toward the end of the conflict. Many of the allegations outlined by the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka have not been adequately addressed by this report\\". The statement noted that so far the Sri Lankan government had made no meaningful attempt at reconciliation or accountability. The statement reiterated the Canadian Government's call for \\"an independent investigation into the credible and serious allegations raised by the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs Panel\\". The Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma issued a statement on 19 December 2011 welcoming the release of the report and the commitments given by the Sri Lankan government in respect the conclusions and recommendations. \\\\- The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton issued a statement on 16 December 2011 on behalf of the European Union noting the presentation of the LLRC report to the Sri Lankan Parliament and expressing hope \\"that the report will contribute to the process of reconciliation in Sri Lanka. A detailed and careful study of the measures proposed to implement the recommendations in the report is needed, including on the issue of accountability. We continue to encourage the Government of Sri Lanka to engage with the UN Secretary General and relevant UN bodies on these matters. In February 2012 some Member of the European Parliament tried unsuccessfully to pass a resolution which welcomed the LLRC report and urged its rapid implementation. Instead the European Parliament passed resolution P7 TA-PROV(2012)0058 B7-0071/2012 in which it called for the \\"establishment of a UN commission of inquiry into all crimes committed, as recommended by the UN Secretary General's Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka\\". \\\\- While welcoming the public release of the LLRC report, an official spokesperson of India‚Äôs External Affairs Ministry expressed hope that Sri Lanka would act decisively and with vision on devolution of powers and genuine national reconciliation. The spokesperson concluded that \\"It is important to ensure that an independent and credible mechanism is put in place to investigate allegations of human rights violations, as brought out the LLRC, in a time-bound manner\\". \\\\- The Department of International Relations and Cooperation issued as statement on 30 January 2012 noting the release of the final report and its positive recommendations. However, the statement noted that the report failed to address in detail \\"the question of holding those people responsible for human rights violations to account\\". The South African government urged the Sri Lankan government to implement the reports recommendations \\"speedily\\". \\\\- Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt issued a statement to the House of Commons on 12 January 2012 welcoming the publication of the report but expressing disappointment at the report‚Äôs findings and recommendations on accountability. The statement went on to say \\"Like many others, we feel that these leave many gaps and unanswered questions...we note that many credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, including from the UN Panel of Experts report, are either not addressed or only partially answered\\". The British Government would, according to the statement, work with international partners, including relevant international organisations, to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. \\\\- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the public release of LLRC report and hoped \\"that the Sri Lankan Government will move forward on its commitments to deal with accountability...in good faith as an essential step towards reconciliation and lasting peace in the island country\\". At the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, welcomed the report's publications and noted that it makes important recommendations. However, Pillay believed that the report fell \\"short of the comprehensive accountability process recommended by the Secretary-General‚Äôs Panel of Experts\\" and she went on the urge the UNHRC to discuss the report. \\\\- Commenting on the report, deputy spokesperson of the United States Department of State Victoria Nuland expressed concern that it \\"does not fully address all the allegations of serious human rights violations that occurred in the final phase of the conflict\\". She therefore urged the Sri Lankan government not only to fulfil all of the LLRC's recommendations but also to address the accountability issues that the report did not cover. On the issue of an independent, international probe into the final phase of the war, Nuland stated that the position of the USA remains that \\"it is better for Sri Lankans to take these issues themselves and address them fully...let‚Äôs see what they are willing to do going forward\\". =Human rights groups= Following the release of the report, Amnesty International noted that the LLRC report \\"acknowledges serious human rights problems in Sri Lanka but falls short of fully addressing the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the final phases of the conflict\\". According to Amnesty the report ignores the \\"serious evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of the laws of war by government forces\\". Amnesty urged the Sri Lankan authorities to take the report's recommendations seriously but concluded that, based on previous experience, \\"effective investigation and prosecution of all wrongdoers...is very unlikely without the active support of the international community\\". Human Rights Watch has condemned the LLRC report for disregarding the worst abuses by government forces, rehashing long-standing recommendations and failing to advance accountability for victims of Sri Lanka‚Äôs civil armed conflict. HRW has stated that the \\"serious shortcomings\\" of the report highlighted \\"the need for an international investigative mechanism into the conflict as recommended by the United Nations Secretary-General‚Äôs Panel of Experts\\". The International Crisis Group welcomed the public release of the LLRC report but noted that it failed in a crucial task - \\"providing the thorough and independent investigation of alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that the UN and other partners of Sri Lanka have been asking for\\". The ICG urged the international community to establish an independent international investigation in 2012. =Others= In an opinion piece in The New York Times the members of the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka (Marzuki Darusman, Steven R. Ratner and Yasmin Sooka) criticised the LLRC report for ignoring or playing down their report's conclusions and for characterising the civilian deaths as a consequence of the army‚Äôs response to Tamil Tiger shelling or cross-fire. They also criticised the report's recommendations that the army and the attorney general carry out further investigation as these organisations had ignored \\"governmental abuses for decades\\". Noting that the Sri Lankan government had failed to implement prior commissions recommendations and its \\"unwillingness to take concrete steps\\", they concluded that the only way for the truth to be exposed is for the United Nations Human Rights Council \\"to create an independent investigative body to determine the facts and identify those responsible\\". The Global Tamil Forum (GTF), an umbrella group for Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora groups, has welcomed the report's publications, stating that its findings \\"only serve to emphasise the importance of establishing an international, independent accountability mechanism to investigate whether Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) breached any international law, committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the last months of the war\\". The GTF acknowledged some the report's judgements and recommendations but noted that some of its conclusions on the prosecution of the conflict contradicted many of the findings of the UN Panel of Experts. Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu ‚Äî the Indian English-language daily ‚Äî N. Ram in his 22 December 2011 editorial stated that the report has established a key fact ‚Äî that there were \\"considerable\\" civilian casualties in the final stages of the military operation to crush the LTTE. The editorial went into detail that \\"Given the ethnic polarisation in Sri Lanka, these recommendations seem painfully insufficient. Even so, this is Sri Lanka's first attempt at introspection about the war. If the government is serious about reconciliation and learning lessons from the past, it must make a start by acting on the LLRC's recommendations.\\" Commenting on the LLRC report, Col. R. Hariharan, a retired Military Intelligence officer of the Indian Army and a columnist of South Asia Analysis Group, said that \\"LLRC report is constructive and covers almost all issues that relate to aberrations in governance, lack of transparency and the need to take speedy action on restoring confidence among Tamil minority.\\" He also added \\"The report provides badly needed breathing space for the government, as the Commission has done a fairly good job if one goes by the President‚Äôs mandate given to it. The well written report analyses in detail the reasons for past and present discontent of Tamils and has drawn the government attention to a number issues that had triggered Tamil insurgency.\\" In an opinion piece in The New York Times journalist Namini Wijedasa describes the report as \\"largely an apologia for the army\\" in respect of the events in the final stages of the civil war. According to Wijedasa, whilst the report makes sensible recommendations, exposes the grave atrocities committed by the LTTE and demonstrates that the government forces shelled the No Fire Zones, it only admits that civilians were killed by crossfire and blames the LTTE for most of the casualties. Wijedasa concludes that \\"Sri Lankans no longer need to pretend that the army didn‚Äôt shell zones where civilians were encouraged to gather [by the army], or subscribe to the fantasy that no innocents died when shells landed on or near hospitals\\". Expressing his support to the LLRC, Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Telmo Languiller said that LLRC report covers all relevant ground and sets the framework for practical reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Namini Wijedasa, a Sri Lankan journalist, called the report \\"an apologia for the army\\". Even in the final weeks when the government took violent measures to defeat the LTTE, the commission only admitted, \\"civilian casualties had in fact occurred in the course of crossfire\\". UN Human Rights Council 19th session Report by Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission became the basis for the discussion on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council 19th session in March 2012. The council adopted a resolution on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, urging the Sri Lankan government to implement constructive recommendations made in the LLRC report. The resolution welcomed the constructive recommendations contained in the report and noted with concern that the report did not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law. Two last-minute changes to the resolution, pressed by India, made it \\"unobtrusive\\" in nature and \\"non-judgemental\\" in approach. These amendments gave the government of Sri Lanka a veto over any future recommendations by the OHCHR. There was no reference to alleged war crimes or an international investigation, as called for by human rights groups.

Its ensemble cast includes Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, and Sanaa Lathan. The plot concerns the spread of a virus transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a pandemic, and the introduction of a vaccine to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the multi-narrative \\"hyperlink cinema\\" style, popularized in several of Soderbergh's films. Following their collaboration on The Informant! (2009), Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns discussed a film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, inspired by epidemics such as the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak and the 2009 flu pandemic. Burns consulted with representatives of the World Health Organization as well as medical experts such as W. Ian Lipkin and Larry Brilliant. Principal photography started in Hong Kong in September 2010, and continued in Chicago, Atlanta, London, Geneva, and San Francisco until February 2011. Contagion premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, and was theatrically released on September 9, 2011. Commercially, the film made $136.5 million against its $60 million production budget. It was praised by critics for its narrative and the performances. It was also well received by scientists, who lauded its accuracy. The film has received renewed popularity because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Plot  Returning from a Hong Kong business trip, Beth Emhoff meets with a former lover during a Chicago layover. Two days later, back home in suburban Minneapolis, she has a seizure. Her husband, Mitch Emhoff, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of unknown causes. Returning home, Mitch finds that his stepson, Clark, has also died. Mitch is isolated but found to be naturally immune; after being released, Mitch protectively keeps his teenage daughter, Jory, quarantined at their house. In Atlanta, Department of Homeland Security representatives meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that the disease may be a bioweapon. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis where she traces everyone who had contact with Beth. She negotiates with reluctant local bureaucrats to commit resources for a public health response. Soon after, Mears becomes infected and dies. As the novel virus spreads, several cities are placed under quarantine, causing wide- spread looting and violence. At the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a combination of genetic material from pig and bat-borne viruses. Research on a cure stalls because scientists are unable to discover a cell culture within which to grow the newly identified MEV-1. Dr. Cheever determines the virus too virulent to be researched at multiple labs and restricts all work to one government site. Dr. Hextall orders University of California researcher Dr. Ian Sussman to destroy his samples. Believing he is close to finding a viable cell culture, Sussman violates Cheever's order and eventually identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells, from which Hextall develops a vaccine. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by respiratory droplets and fomites, with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates; they project that 1 in 12 of the world population will be infected, with a 25‚Äì30% mortality rate. Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his blog. In one video, he claims to have cured himself of the virus using a homeopathic cure derived from forsythia. People seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies, turning violent when limited supplies run out. During a television interview, Krumwiede discloses that Cheever secretly warned his fianc√©e to leave Chicago before quarantine was declared. Cheever is informed he will be investigated. Krumwiede, having faked being infected to boost sales of forsythia, is arrested for conspiracy and securities fraud. Using an attenuated virus, Hextall identifies a potential vaccine. To expedite the vaccine development, Hextall bypasses the informed consent test subject process. She instead inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine, then visits her infected father. She does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success. The CDC awards vaccinations by lottery based on birthdates. By this time, the death toll has reached 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide. Earlier in Hong Kong, World Health Organization epidemiologist Dr. Leonora Orantes and public health officials comb through security video tapes of Beth's contacts in a Macau casino and identify her as the index case. Government official Sun Feng kidnaps Orantes as leverage to obtain MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village, holding her for months. WHO officials provide the village with earliest vaccines and Orantes is released. When she learns the vaccines were placebos, she runs to warn the village. In a flashback to the spillover event, a bulldozer razes palm trees while clearing a rainforest in China, disturbing some bats' natural habitat. One bat finds shelter in a pig farm and drops an infected piece of banana, which is eaten by a pig. The pig is slaughtered and prepared by a chef in a Macau casino, who transmits the virus to Beth via a handshake.  Cast  Marion Cotillard in 2017 * Marion Cotillard as Dr. Leonora Orantes, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization :Orantes' main objective is to trace the origins of the MEV-1 pathogen. Cotillard, a fan of Soderbergh's work, first met with the director in Los Angeles, California. The French actress was enthralled with the script because she was \\"very concerned about germs. I've always been ... scared, in a way, by all of those disease[s]. So ... it was really something I was really interested.\\" Soderbergh said that Orantes \\"gets dropped into situations and has to deal with cultural as well as scientific issues that are sometimes at odds\\", and notes that she has a \\"professional\\" yet stubborn, \\"remote\\", and \\"dispassionate\\" demeanor, though \\"something happens to her in the course of the story that causes a significant emotional shift.\\" Matt Damon, a frequent collaborator of Soderbergh's, was chosen to portray Mitch Emhoff. * Matt Damon as Mitch Emhoff :Damon viewed his character as the embodiment of the \\"everyman\\"‚Äîan individual who is seen as \\"one of the human faces of the supervirus\\" following his wife and stepson's deaths. Soderbergh also noted Mitch's \\"common individual\\" lack of medical and scientific knowledge, though keeping the situation dynamic and compelling was challenging for the director, as he was concerned that Emhoff would be a one-dimensional character. Soderbergh felt that Damon understood the concept and addressed the producers' concerns. \\"You never catch him acting\\", said Soderbergh. \\"There's no vanity, no self-consciousness in his performance; it's as if the cameras aren't there.\\" Writer Scott Z. Burns sent him a copy of the script with a \\"read this and then go wash your hands\\" note attached to it. Damon recalled: \\"I just really want to be in this movie. It was a terrific, riveting, really fast read and really exciting and really horrifying, but managed to be really touching.\\" * Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Ellis Cheever :Soderbergh admired Fishburne's ability to portray an emphatic and assertive figure in previous films. To Fishburne, Cheever was a \\"smart\\", \\"competent\\" physician who often epitomized a \\"voice of reason\\". Once he conferred with W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist and professor at Columbia University, the character's complexities were nonexistent for the actor. Fishburne stated, \\"The personal stuff that I have as Ellis Cheever was telling my fianc√©e, soon-to-be wife, Sanaa Lathan, to get out of town, to leave, to pack up, to not talk. That's really easy. Any human being in that situation is going to do that, I think.\\" * Jude Law as Alan Krumwiede :Krumwiede is an ardent conspiracy theorist who, according to Law, is the so-called index patient for \\"what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic\\". \\"We definitely wanted him to have a messianic streak\\", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti- government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that \\"what's interesting is that you're not really sure about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect at one time or another that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view.\\" * Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff :A \\"working mom\\", as described by Paltrow, Beth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Beth was \\"lucky\\" as she thought the disease's survivors were being left to deal with the newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs to be used in the film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. \\"I was just another tourist taking pictures\\", she said, and added, \\"I did feel a little pressure. When Steven Soderbergh gives you a photo assignment, you had better come back with something decent.\\" Kate Winslet traveled to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where she met with many of the employees to research her character. * Kate Winslet as Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer :In researching her character, Winslet traveled to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), currently in Atlanta, Georgia, where she consulted with current and former officers of the Epidemic Intelligence Service to receive insight on not only the daily life, but on the type of person qualified for the occupation. \\"These are people who can be sent into war zones where there's been an outbreak of a new virus. Fear is not an option. If they feel it, they learn to push it aside.\\" Winslet felt that Mears was able to bring the epidemic \\"down to the layman's level\\" so the viewer could comprehend the scope of it without the science dragging the story down. * Bryan Cranston as Rear Admiral Lyle Haggerty, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps * Jennifer Ehle as Dr. Ally Hextall, a research scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention :Soderbergh had seen Ehle's performance in Michael Clayton (2007), though it was ultimately cut prior to the film's release, and it prompted him to offer her a role in Contagion. He \\"had known who Jennifer was for a long time, and this didn't take a lot of thought, honestly\\". * Elliott Gould as Dr. Ian Sussman :A research scientist at the University of California San Francisco, a medical campus, Sussman identifies a cell culture capable of growing the virus. * Chin Han as Sun Feng :Han spoke of his character's development: \\"He starts off as a button-down, serious ... government official, and then as the movie progresses ... you find out a different side of him and his secret agenda.\\" * John Hawkes as Roger, CDC custodian and acquaintance of Dr. Cheever * Anna Jacoby-Heron as Jory Emhoff, daughter of Mitch Emhoff * Josie Ho as Li Fai's sister * Sanaa Lathan as Aubrey Cheever, fianc√©e of Dr. Cheever * Demetri Martin as Dr. David Eisenberg, CDC colleague of Dr. Hextall * Armin Rohde as Damian Leopold, a WHO official * Enrico Colantoni as Dennis French, a Department of Homeland Security official * Larry Clarke as Dave, a Minnesota health official working with Dr. Mears * Monique Gabriela Curnen as Lorraine Vasquez, a print journalist in San Francisco  Production  = Conception and writing = Concerted efforts to devise Contagion coincided with Burns' collaboration with Soderbergh in The Informant! (2009). The duo had initially planned to create a biographical film on Leni Riefenstahl, a trailblazer in German cinema during the 1930s and a figure in the rise of the Nazi Party. Soderbergh later contacted Burns to cancel the project, as he thought that a film about Riefenstahl would struggle to attract an audience. Intrigued with the field of transmission, Burns suggested that they instead create a film that centered on a pandemic situation‚Äî\\"an interesting thriller version of a pandemic movie\\". His main objective was to construct a medical thriller that \\"really felt like what could happen\\". Burns consulted with Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Brilliant, renowned for his work in eradicating smallpox, to develop an accurate perception of a pandemic event. He had seen one of Brilliant's TED presentations, which he was fascinated by, and realized that \\"the point of view of people within that field isn't 'If this is going to happen', it's 'When is this going to happen? Brilliant introduced Burns to another specialist, W. Ian Lipkin. With the aid of these physicians, the producers were able to obtain additional perspectives from representatives of the World Health Organization. Burns also met with the author of The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett. Her 1995 book helped Burns consider a variety of potential plots for the film. He wanted to feature an official from the CDC, and ultimately decided to use an epidemiologist, since that role requires interacting with people while tracking the disease. Although he had done research on pandemics six months prior to the 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was \\"really helpful\\" to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic. To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation. \\"I saw them come to life\\", Burns said, \\"and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their kids at home?' Things happening online, which is where the Jude Law character came from, that there's going to be information that comes out online where people want to be ahead of the curve, so some people will write things about anti-virals or different treatment protocols, and so there's always going to be an information and that information also has sort of a viral pulse.\\" = Filming = Some of Chicago's landscape provided for the setting of Minneapolis and Atlanta. hostage exchange scene was filmed in Tsuen Wan Chinese Permanent Cemetery, Hong Kong. In conjunction with overseeing the directing process, Soderbergh functioned as a cinematographer for Contagion. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema's RED One MX digital camera, which has a 4.5K image resolution. Question: So, when it was all said and done, how much of the film was shot with the MX, and how much with the EPIC, Jim? James Jannard: 100% MX. And Steven called the grade. Since he hoped for the premise to be authentic and \\"as realistic as possible\\", Soderbergh opted not to film in the studio. \\"There's, to me, nothing more satisfying occasionally than making someplace look like someplace else on film and having nobody know the difference.\\" For choosing cities, Soderbergh felt that they couldn't \\"go anywhere where one of our characters hasn't been\\", since he wanted to portray an \\"epic\\", yet \\"intimate\\" scenario. He explained, > We can't cut to a city or a group of extras that we've never been to that we > don‚Äôt know personally. That was our rule. And that‚Äôs a pretty significant > rule to adhere to in a movie in which you're trying to give a sense of > something that‚Äôs happening on a large scale, but we felt that all of the > elements that we had issues with prior, when we see any kind of disaster > film, we're centered around that idea. Principal photography started in Hong Kong in September 2010, and continued for approximately two weeks. Soderbergh was originally hoping to also film in mainland China, though Moviefone journalist David Ehrlich believed that permission from the Chinese government was unlikely to be forthcoming. Although producers also intended to establish a filming location in one of the many casinos in Macau, the Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Hong Kong's Aberdeen Harbour was used instead for the casino setting, as filming within the vicinity of a gambling establishment is prohibited by law. To move the equipment for the casino scenes to the on-the-water location, producers hired a number of locals to carry out the task, as they were accustomed to \\"using sampans like trucks\\". Additional locations included the Hong Kong International Airport, InterContinental Hong Kong, and the Princess Margaret Hospital. Principal photography relocated in the following month to Chicago, Illinois, which served as the nexus for production. Much of the cityscape and its surrounding suburbs were used to emulate Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Atlanta, Georgia, in addition to serving as backdrop for Chicago itself. Since principal photography occurred during the winter months, snowfall was a prerequisite in simulating a \\"persistent coldness\\" that encompassed \\"a hypersensitive kind of glare\\". Within the city limits, filming locations were installed at the Shedd Aquarium, O'Hare International Airport, and the Midway Airport. Arguably the largest sets were at the General Jones Armory, which was converted into an infirmary, and a major location shoot occurred in Waukegan, where a portion of the Amstutz Expressway was used to simulate the Dan Ryan Expressway. Production also took place at Sherman Hospital in Elgin and Central Elementary School in Wilmette, and also in Downtown Western Springs, where the grocery store scene was filmed. Filming moved once again in January 2011 to the Druid Hills quadrant of Atlanta, which contains the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days. Genentech Hall at the University of California, San Francisco Mission Bay campus was used for filming also, renamed Mendel Hall for the occasion. = Soundtrack = Cliff Martinez composed the film's soundtrack, which was his first big-screen score for Soderbergh since Solaris in 2002. Given that the pacing of the music was one of Soderbergh's biggest concerns, Martinez needed to maintain a brisk pace throughout the soundtrack, while also conveying fear and hope within the music. \\"I tried to create the sound of anxiety. And at key, strategic moments I tried to use the music to conjure up the sense of tragedy and loss.\\" Martinez incorporated orchestral elements, and fused them with the predominantly electronic sounds of the score. He noted that the \\"sound palette for Contagion came by way of combining three very different approaches Steven went through as he was cutting the film.\\" Martinez received a rough cut for the film in October 2010, which contained music that was imbued with elements of The French Connection (1971) and Marathon Man (1976). He \\"loved\\" those two soundtracks, and composed a few pieces in their style. A few months later, he acquired a new cut, which included music influenced by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. Toward the end, Soderbergh changed again and used contemporary soundtrack music that was \\"more energetic and more rhythmic\\". Ultimately, Martinez used aspects of all three approaches: \\"I reasoned that combining them would not only be effective but would give the score a style all its own.\\" The score was released by WaterTower Music in September 2011.  Themes and analysis  An electron microscope image of the H1N1 influenza virus. The 2009 flu epidemic was a key inspiration and influence on the creation of Contagion. An electron microscope image of the SARS virus. The 2003 SARS outbreak was also an inspiration and influence of Contagion. Steven Soderbergh was motivated to make an \\"ultra-realistic\\" film about the public health and scientific response to a pandemic. The film's \\"hyperlink style\\" (often quickly moving back and forth from geographically distant places and persons) emphasizes both the historically new perils of contemporary networked globalization and timeless qualities of the human condition (recalling famous literary treatments of epidemics, such as Albert Camus' The Plague). The movie touches on a variety of themes, including the factors which drive mass panic and collapse of social order, the scientific process for characterizing and containing a novel pathogen, balancing personal motives against professional responsibilities and ethics in the face of an existential threat, the limitations and consequences of public health responses, and the pervasiveness of interpersonal connections which can serve as vectors to spread disease. Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The movie was intended to realistically convey the \\"intense\\" and \\"unnerving\\" social and scientific reactions to a pandemic. The real-life epidemics such as the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS outbreak and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film. The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the Nipah virus (which infects cells in the respiratory and nervous systems, the same cells as the virus in the movie) that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation. The film presents examples of crowd psychology and collective behavior which can lead to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have in the context of a pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together. Against this existential threat and fraying social order, the film also explores how individual characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons. Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments on a cell line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fianc√©e to leave the city before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in alternative medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people. These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi- narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced. The story also highlights examples of political cronyism (a plane to evacuate Dr. Mears from Minneapolis is instead diverted to evacuate a congressman), platitudes and rigid thinking (public health officials consider postponing the closing of shopping malls until after the Thanksgiving shopping season), federal responders trying to navigate 50 separate state-level public health policies, and the heroism of Federal bureaucrats. Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media play a role in Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic. Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro- level decisions.  Reception  = Release and box office = Contagion premiered on September 3, 2011, at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in Venice, Italy, and a wider release followed on September 9. In the United States and Canada, Contagion was shown in 3,222 theaters, of which 254 screenings occurred at IMAX venues. Various American commercial analysts anticipated that the film would have ticket sales of between $20‚Äì$25 million during its opening weekend, which it did, grossing $8 million on its first day, and $23.1 million for the entire weekend. Of that total, ten percent ($2.3 million) of the gross came from IMAX screenings. By outgrossing competitor The Help ($8.7M), Contagion became the highest-grossing film of the week. Demographically, the opening audience was evenly divided among gender, according to Warner Bros., while eighty percent of spectators were of the age of 25 and over. Contagion did well the following weekend, generating a $14.5 million box office, but came in second to the re-release of The Lion King (1994). The third week saw the box office drop by forty percent, for a total gross of $8.7 million. By the fourth week, Contagion had dropped to ninth place at the box office with $5 million, and the number of theaters narrowed to 2,744. The film completed its theatrical run on December 15, 2011, at which point its total domestic gross was $75.6 million. Contagion made its international debut in six foreign markets the same weekend as its American release, including Italy, where it achieved $663,000 from 309 theaters. The first week saw Contagion gross $2.1 million from 553 establishments‚Äîa per- theater average of $3,797. Foreign grosses for Contagion would remain relatively stagnant up until the weekend of October 14‚Äì16, 2011, when the film expanded into several additional European markets. Out of the $3.9 million that was generated from 1,100 venues during that weekend, nearly 40% of the gross originated from Spain, where the film earned $1.5 million from 325 theaters. With the growing expansion of the film in seven additional markets, the weekend of October 21‚Äì23, 2011 saw Contagion take in $9.8 million from 2,505 locations, increasing the international gross to $22.9 million. In the United Kingdom, one of the film's significant international releases, Contagion opened in third place at the box office with $2.3 million from 398 theaters; it subsequently garnered the highest debut gross of a Soderbergh film since Ocean's Thirteen (2007). International grosses for Contagion totaled $60.8 million. = Critical response = Contagion has received positive reviews by film commentators. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 272 reviews, with an average rating of 7.09/10. The website's critics consensus states, \\"Tense, tightly plotted, and bolstered by a stellar cast, Contagion is an exceptionally smart ‚Äì and scary ‚Äì disaster movie.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on the critiques from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 70 based on 38 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. The Guardian journalist Peter Bradshaw felt that Contagion blended well together as a film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful in channeling the fears, frights, and \\"the massive sense of loss\\" of \\"ordinary people\\". To David Denby of The New Yorker, the \\"brilliant\\" film was \\"serious, precise, frightening,\\" and \\"emotionally enveloping\\". Despite applauding Soderbergh for \\"hopscotching\\" tidily \\"between the intimate and international\\", The Atlantic Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and \\"clinical\\" disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson \\"beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'.\\" \\"For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is,\\" professed The Atlantic writer. Describing it as a \\"smart\\" and \\"spooky\\" installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images of men and women isolated in the frame, in the blurred point of view of the dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look.\\" In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the \\"crisp\\" and succinct narrative matched up to the \\"beautifully composed\\" visuals of the film. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the \\"shrewd\\" and \\"unsensationalistic\\" film without becoming exaggerated, a sentiment echoed by Jeannette Catsoulis of NPR, who insisted that the duo \\"weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling\\". Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the \\"self- consciousness\\" and \\"experimentation\\" of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009). The performances of multiple cast members were frequently mentioned in the reviews. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post asserted that Ehle was \\"outstanding\\", a view that was analogous to that of The Boston Globe journalist Wesley Morris, who praised not only Ehle's performance, but the work of the \\"undercard\\" such as Cranston, Gould, and Colantoni, among others. Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Ehle the \\"best in show\\". As Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan summed up, \\"Two-time Tony-winning actress Jennifer Ehle comes close to stealing the picture with this quietly yet quirkily empathetic performance.\\" With regard to Law, The Philadelphia Inquirer Steven Rea stated that the actor portrayed the character with a \\"nutty\\" confidence; Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle agreed with Rea's thoughts. Damon provided the film's \\"relatable heart\\", according to Forrest Wickman of Slate, who concluded that even with her controlled performance, Winslet \\"lives up to her head-of-the-class reputation even in an unusually small role\\". The character development of multiple characters produced varying response from critics. Contrary to Mitch's stance as the main protagonist, Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post felt that Contagion \\"treats him with an oddly clinical detachment\\". In particular Law's character, Alan Krumwiede, attracted commentary from Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times, who wrote, \\"The blogger subplot doesn't interact clearly with the main story lines and functions mostly as an alarming but vague distraction.\\" = Scientific response = Ferris Jabr of New Scientist approved of Contagion for accurately portraying the \\"successes and frustrations\\" of science. Jabr cites story elements such as \\"the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they need to figure out how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells\\" as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science writer, praised the film, stating, \\"It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die.\\" He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that \\"Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk.\\" Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that \\"typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here.\\" Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus. = Home media = Contagion was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on January 3, 2012, and in the United Kingdom on March 5, 2012. In its first week of release, the film topped the DVD chart with 411,000 units sold for $6.16 million. That same week it sold 274,000 Blu-ray copies for $4.93 million, topping that chart as well. DVD sales dropped during the second week of release, with 193,000 units sold for $2.89 million. As of early July 2012, Contagion had sold 802,535 copies in DVD, for $12.01 million in revenue. = Renewed popularity = In 2020, the film received renewed popularity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which bears some resemblance to the pandemic depicted in the film. By March 2020, Contagion was the seventh most popular film on iTunes, listed as the number two catalog title on Warner Bros. compared to its number 270 rank the past December 2019, and had average daily visits on piracy websites increase by 5,609 percent in January 2020 compared to the previous month. HBO Now also reported that Contagion had been the most viewed film for two weeks straight. Regarding its resurgence in 2020, screenwriter Scott Z. Burns responded in a interview with The Washington Post saying, \\"It is sad, and it is frustrating. Sad because so many people are dying and getting sick. Frustrating because people still don‚Äôt seem to grasp the situation we are now in and how it could have been avoided by properly funding the science around all of this. It is also surreal to me that people from all over the world write to me asking how I knew it would involve a bat or how I knew the term \\"social distancing.\\" I didn‚Äôt have a crystal ball ‚Äî I had access to great expertise. So, if people find the movie to be accurate, it should give them confidence in the public health experts who are out there right now trying to guide us.\\" As the film continued to regain popularity, the cast reunited through an infomercial PSA in partnership with the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in March 2020.

The film stars Mikael Persbrandt, Trine Dyrholm, and Ulrich Thomsen in a story which takes place in small-town Denmark and a refugee camp in Africa. A Danish majority production with co-producers in Sweden, In a Better World won the 2011 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film as well as the award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.\\"Denmark's 'In a Better World' wins foreign Oscar\\", Associated Press, 28 February 2011. Retrieved 28 February 2011. The film also won European Film Awards for Best Director, in addition to receiving nominations for Best Film. Persbrandt also was nominated for Best Actor. Plot Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) is a Swedish doctor who commutes between his home in Denmark and his work in a Sudanese refugee camp. In Sudan, he often treats female patients who are the victims of a sadistic warlord. Anton is married to Marianne (Trine Dyrholm), but they are separated, and struggling with the possibility of divorce over an affair that Anton had with another woman. They have two young sons, the older one being 12-year-old Elias (Markus Rygaard). Christian (William J√∏hnk Juels Nielsen), who has just moved from London with his father, Claus (Ulrich Thomsen), is a new boy at Elias' school. Christian's mother recently died from cancer, and Christian blames his father for lying to him that she would get well, and that, in a late stage of her disease, he \\"wanted\\" her to die. Elias is bullied at school, until he is defended by Christian, who assaults the main bully and threatens him with a knife. Christian gives Elias the knife, and both boys lie to the police, and their parents, about the incident. When Anton separates his younger son from another child, while they are fighting at a playground, the father of the other child, a mechanic, tells Anton not to touch his child and slaps Anton in the face. Anton later visits the mechanic at his work, accompanied by his children and Christian, to discuss the matter, and to show the children that he is not afraid of the man. The boorish and xenophobic mechanic insults Anton's nationality and slaps him several more times, but Anton does not flinch from the blows. Later, in Sudan, the psychopathic warlord comes to Anton's hospital for treatment of his wounded leg. To the horror of his staff and others, and acting at the expense of his own moral convictions, Anton treats the man. He does demand, however, that no weapons, and only two of his guards, be allowed inside the hospital. The warlord's leg seems to slowly heal and Anton barely tolerates his presence in the camp, but after the warlord shows contempt for one of his victims, Anton drags him away from the clinic, allowing him to be beaten to death by local people. In Denmark, Christian and Elias decide to make a bomb to destroy the mechanic's car, on a Sunday morning so that no passers-by might be hurt. With the fuse already burning, they see two joggers approaching (a mother and her young daughter), and Elias leaves his protected position to warn them. He is knocked unconscious, but saves the joggers from harm. Christian is questioned by the police and then released, with the incident being addressed as an extreme case of vandalism. He goes to the hospital to visit Elias, but Marianne does not let him see the boy, instead telling him that he has killed her son. Christian, believing that Elias is dead, climbs to the roof of a silo, contemplating suicide, but is rescued by Anton. Christian is relieved that Elias is doing well, and he is now allowed to visit him. Christian is reconciled with his father, and Anton and Marianne have sex, apparently resuming their marriage.

They then wanted to write a story where dramatic turns of events would disrupt the image of a place perceived as blissful. The development of the narrative started with the character that would be played by Mikael Persbrandt, and the idea of an idealist who becomes the victim of an assault. The two writers had no specific actors in mind while developing the story but rewrote details when the leads had been cast. The film was produced by Denmark's Zentropa in co-production with DR2 and Sweden's Memfis Film, Sveriges Television, Trollh√§ttan Film and Film i V√§st. It received seven million Danish kroner from the Danish Film Institute as well as funding from the Swedish Film Institute, the pan-Nordic Nordisk Film- & TV-Fond and the European Union's MEDIA Programme. Filming started at the end of August 2009 and took place on Funen and in Kenya. Themes Director Susanne Bier said: \\"Our experiment in this film is about looking at how little it really takes before a child ‚Äì or an adult ‚Äì thinks something is deeply unjust. It really doesn't take much, and I find that profoundly interesting. And scary.\\" Reception =Critical response= Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% out of 122 professional critics gave the film a positive review, and an average rating of 7.11/10, with the site consensus stating that \\"In a Better World is a sumptuous melodrama that tackles some rather difficult existential and human themes.\\"In a Better World. Rotten Tomatoes. Fandango Media. Retrieved on 17 October 2020. On Metacritic the film has a score of 65 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Kim Skotte called the film a \\"powerful and captivating drama\\" in Politiken. Out of the four collaborations between Jensen and Bier, he considered In a Better World to be the one most similar to Jensen's solo films and compared the combination of biblical themes and high entertainment value to Jensen's 2005 film Adam's Apples. Skotte also praised the acting performances: \\"Mighty Mikael Persbrandt shows that he is Scandinavia's most charismatic actor right now. Trine Dyrholm's scenes are fewer, but in a split second she can dramatise the canvas to make the throat lace itself. Also Ulrich Thomsen is good as grief-stricken single father. With her successful directing of the two boys Markus Rygaard and William J√∏hnk Nielsen, Bier adds a new chapter to her already extensive resum√© of top tuned skills.\\" Peter Nielsen of Dagbladet Information called In a Better World \\"in all ways a successful film\\", and although there \\"is no doubt that Susanne Bier can tell a good story\\", he was not entirely convinced: \\"She can seduce, and she can push the completely correct emotional buttons, so that mothers' as well as fathers' hearts are struck, but she doesn't earnestly drill her probe into the meat.\\" =Accolades= On 19 January 2011, it made the shortlist for Best Foreign Language Film and on 25 January, it was selected as one of the final five nominees and won as the Danish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 83rd Academy Awards.

The website, founded by film-maker Rene Daalder in collaboration with interactive designer Folkert Gorter, went public at the end of 2007, and is now occupied by more than 2500 contributors. Gorter is besides the site's interaction designer also the main curator of the SpaceCollective Gallery, a showcase of images and texts. The system architecture and technology of the website is created by Josh Pangell. A series of videos is presented on the website called \\"The Future of Everything\\". These episodes are edited by Aaron Ohlmann and produced by American Scenes Inc; executive producer: Joseph Kaufman. The website's slogan is \\"Where forward thinking terrestrials exchange ideas and information about the state of the species, their planet and the universe, living the lives of science fiction today\\". History The initial idea of SpaceCollective was to make a story driven website based on the idea of Carl Sagan's Voyager Golden Record, a time capsule that contains the life on Earth that was sent into space. But soon Rene Daalder realized that in a place of non-linearity and interactivity such a movie-like project wasn't going to work. Daalder teamed up with Folkert Gorter to build a website with intrinsic value of its own. Inspired by thinkers like Carl Sagan, Gene Roddenberry, Marshall McLuhan and Timothy Leary, who helped articulate the future by adopting a pop culture vernacular, they wanted to \\"use the online platform to do something similar for our times in a radically different interactive medium\\". They wanted to use the Internet to create updates of the Voyager Golden Record and beam them up in space every month. Because in 2006 the Internet shifted from primarily text-based to video-based they decided to create the video series called \\"The Future if Everything\\". In an interview with Volume Magazine, Rene Daalder said the goal of the project is: \\"The Internet and the larger digital realm of computer intelligence it connects with provide us with the blueprint for the future far before the physical world is able to follow its lead. And in the case of Space Collective we use all the information that is available online to help people see the forest for the trees, opening them up to new perspectives. There are lots of people with the desire to change the world, but they have been conditioned that that is an almost impossible ambition to accomplish.\\". Projects A growing number of universities, architecture and design schools are conducting projects on SpaceCollective. Several of these courses are initiated by SpaceCollective, others are originated by the schools, who may opt to open them up to the public or restrict them to participation By Invite Only. The Public Projects, whether created by SpaceCollective or its members, are open to all registered users. One of these projects is \\"The Voyager update project\\".

Phylogeny In 2006, Latiolais and colleagues proposed a cladogram (a tree of descent) that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus including Doxander vittatus (referred to as Strombus vittatus in their analysis), and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny, Strombus vittatus, Strombus canarium (= Laevistrombus canarium) and Strombus epidromis (= Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely related and appear to share a common ancestor.

It is best known for its showjumping, however it also has competitions in horse showing, driving, mounted games, dog agility and more recently dressage. Evening sessions are broadcast live by the BBC each year, with the puissance. It is held over seven days, in the week preceding Christmas, and many of the events are Christmas themed. The show is split into ticketed morning, afternoon and evening sessions.  History  The first show in its current form was held in 1907 , however an agricultural show (known as the first great horse show) has been held here since 1888. Reginald Gardiner Heaton, a horse breeder from Chatteris in Cambridgeshire, is said to have thought up the show. Early in 1906, Gardiner Heaton invited friends to dinner with the intention of persuading them to organise an international show on similar lines to those in New York, Paris and Brussels. The dinner was successful and Reginald Heaton became the Managing Director, a post he held for over 25 years. The inaugural show was attended by much of the upper class including Edward VII, Alexandra of Denmark, George V, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge The entrants were from around the world; France, Italy, Belgium and even Russia. Lord Lonsdale then president of the National Sporting Club of Britain was the Show's first President. The roll of Directors listed in early programmes included many prominent and wealthy patrons with at least 10 Dukes, 11 Marquises, 54 Earls, 25 Viscounts, 80 Lords, and 28 Knights who were made honorary Vice-Presidents. The show was closed during World War I and suffered from the economic instability and industrialisation between the wars. In 1939 the last International Horse Show was held at Olympia. It was resurrected in 1947 at a different venue in White City, London. However, in December 1972, Reginald Heaton and Raymond Brooks-Ward decided to bring a horse show back to Olympia. Olympia ‚Äì The London International Horse Show has since become a highlight of the equestrian calendar and part of the equestrian Christmas tradition. The London International Horse Show celebrated its 100th Anniversary in 2007 as 'one of Europe's oldest equine competitions‚Äô.Olympia to celebrate 100th anniversary , Horse and hound, 26 March, 2007 In 2010 it was held as CSI 5*-W (Show Jumping World Cup event) and CDI-W (Dressage World Cup event).Excerpt from the FEI calendar  Competitions  The show has FEI competitions in combined driving, dressage and show jumping as well as showing and mounted games. = Combined Driving = There are three combined driving events, the extreme driving and two FEI World Cup classes. A driver drives a four horse carriage, round a set of obstacles against the clock, with two grooms also on the carriage. Faults are gained if an obstacle is knocked or the incorrect route is taken, the top score with least faults wins. = Dressage = On the first day of the modern show, there is an FEI Grand Prix invitational class. On the second day there is an FEI dressage to music class where riders are allowed to choreograph their own routine to music incorporating a number of compulsory movements. = Showjumping = The show has showjumping classes on each day of the show, each with Christmas themed names such as the Longines Christmas Cracker. These culminate in the 1.60m FEI Show Jumping World Cup on the Saturday and the Grand Prix on the Sunday . Riders generally compete over the week and have the chance of gaining points in each class for leading rider. Many of the top showjumping riders in the world compete annually, as well as many of Britain's finest, including Ellen Whitaker, Tim Stockdale, Ben Maher, Nick Skelton and many more. The event also has non FEI competitions including the Puissance, the six bar, accumulators, mini-major and the Markel Champions Challenge where jockeys compete at showjumping to raise money for the injured jockeys fund. = Showing = The show hosts the final for the British Show Pony Society Mountain and Moorland championships and the Olympia Senior Showing Series Championships.  Exhibits  In more recent years, the show also has exhibition guests which show different forms of horsemanship from around the world. Attendees include the Metropolitan Police Service's mounted regiment. Each year there is also a Shetland Grand National where a group of riders aged 8-14 ride Shetland ponies around a track over small jumps mimicking the Grand National held at Aintree. Many of these riders have progressed onto becoming professional jockeys such as Sam Twiston-Davies. All proceeds of the event go to the Bob Champion cancer trust. Every session concludes with the Christmas Finale, a mix of theatrics, dancing, singing ending with a visit from Father Christmas himself in a horse-drawn carriage.

Players control a Chinese policeman who must dispatch numerous enemies while progressing through the game's levels. The object of the game is to rescue a senior policeman and his daughter, both of whom have been kidnapped by a gang and spirited away to an underground hideout. The most interesting thing about this game is that it is freely (and not officially) inspired from two popular manga of this period: Dragon Ball, for the main character' aspect and powers (can throw kamehamehas and uses a sort of Ka√Øo-Ken). Hokuto No Ken, for bosses' aspect and technics they use. Video game adaptations of these two manga were rare in 1988 (apart from NES and Master System), that's why the game was somehow (and is still) popular among a category of players. The game received though a mixed response from games critics. Gameplay Players control a Chinese policeman who has been tasked with infiltrating an underground base to rescue a high-ranking police officer and his daughter, who have been kidnapped by a gang. Play consists of kicking and punching numerous enemies, sweeps and flying kicks can also be used. The game begins in an underground corridor populated by armored soldiers and fighters who throw shurikens. The player must follow the on-screen arrow which points them in the right direction as they proceed deeper into the caves and encounter greater numbers of more deadly enemies. A martial arts expert boss guards the exit of each level and quickly defeat the player-character if not fought carefully. The player has one life in the game, represented by a health bar which drains as enemies land attacks on the player-character. Should the health bar drain completely, the game is over and a plump golden cherub will rise from the player-character's body. Should the player pay for another credit and continue the game, the cherub will dive back inside the player-character's body, who will in turn jumps to his feet with a shocked expression. Release The original arcade game was not released on any computer or console systems of the era. Kuri Kinton was eventually released in 2006 as part of the video game compilation Taito Legends 2, for Windows and the PlayStation 2 and Xbox games consoles and for PlayStation Portable on the compilation Taito Legends Power Up. Reception Kuri Kinton has received a mixed response from reviewers and critics. Retrogames' staff member writing in a 2010 feature described the levels as bland, criticised the game's bosses for being effectively the same character with different colored clothes. Despite this, the reviewer stated \\"..there's something quite fun about the game that makes it difficult to put down..\\". Kung-Fu Master was suggested as a more readily accessible game with similar gameplay. ACE's Andy Smith was more critical when writing in 1988. He stated \\"Kuri Kinton's a dull game, the graphics aren't anything special and the game style's very old hat by today's standards.\\" Computer and Video Games' 1989 review was more positive, the reviewer praised the game's \\"..large sprites and well drawn graphics\\" and stated \\"Kuri Kinton packs a hell of a punch and is far more playable than The Last Apostle.\\" As part of the Taito Legends 2 compilation the game was described as \\"..fairly standard side- scrolling brawler fodder..\\" by Eurogamer's Kristan Reed.

History  In 1951 some airclubs requested from the Department of Aeronautics (Secretar√≠a de Aeron√°utica) that a side-by-side two-seater sports glider should be built. Its development was assigned to the Instituto Aerot√©cnico (I.Ae.), in Cordoba. The design team was led by Professor Reimar Horten, who was a pioneer in the design of tailless flying wing planes. His project H.XVc was submitted to the Department of Aeronautics, and was assigned the denomination I.Ae.41 \\"Urub√∫\\" (meaning \\"owl\\" in mapudungun). Production at the FMA was limited to five planes, and the first flight was in 1953. In September 1956, after a proposal from the \\"Direcci√≥n de Fomento de la Aviaci√≥n Civil\\" (Civil Aviation Directorate), a crossing of the Andes Mountain Range (\\"Cordillera de los Andes\\") with sailplanes was attempted. The gliders chosen were the I.Ae.41 Urub√∫, towed by a Morane-Saulnier, and a Slingsby Sky glider, towed by a Stearman. Pilots Hans Scheidhauer (Urub√∫) and Claudio Dori (Sky) flew from San Carlos de Bariloche (Argentina) to Paraje Ensenada (Chile). The flight lasted three hours, crossing over: Cerro Otto, Cerro Catedral, the Tristeza branch of Nahuel Huapi lake, Puerto Blest, Cerro Tornador, Laguna Fr√≠a, Lan√≠n Volcano, Cerro El Puntiagudo and Cerro Osorno.  Description  The I.Ae 41 was a wooden aircraft, similar in general to the preceding I.Ae. 34 Clen Ant√∫ but with a spacious twin-seat side-by-side cockpit. Its design incorporated lessons learnt from its predecessor and it had improved aerodynamics, showing better handling in turbulent conditions.

Some clearly have Christian influences, but others are believed by scholars to represent native flood myths of pre- Columbian origin.Horcasitas 1988, passim One myth documented among the Tlapanec and Huaxtecs has a man and his dog as the sole survivors of the deluge, but the man finds out that the dog takes the shape of a woman during the day when he is away. The man and the dogwoman then repopulate the earth. Another myth found among the Aztec and Totonac peoples relates how a human couple survive by hiding in a hollow vessel and start to cook a fish when the water subsides. When the smoke reaches the heavens the gods become angry and punish them by turning them into dogs or monkeys depending on the version. In Maya mythology as expressed in the Popol Vuh the creator gods attempted to create creatures who would worship them three times before finally succeeding in creating a race of humans that would pay proper homage to their creators. The three previous creations were destroyed. The third race of humans carved from wood were destroyed by a flood, mauled by wild animals and smashed by their own tools and utensils.Markman & Markman 1992:79,151Tedlock 1985 Maya flood myths recorded by Diego de Landa and in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel holds that the only survivors of the flood were the four Bacabs who took their places as upholders of the four corners of the sky.Horcasitas 1988: 191 In Mesoamerican myth a variety of reasons are given for the occurrence of the flood: either the world was simply very old and needed to be renewed; the humans had neglected their duty to adore the gods; or they were punished for a transgression (cannibalism, for example). Many of the modern myths included obviously Christian references such as the murder of Abel by Cain as the reason. In Mesoamerican myth the flood was but one of several destructions of the creation ‚Äî usually the first of three or four cataclysmic events, although there is some evidence that the Aztecs considered the flood to be the fourth. In many Mesoamerican flood myths, especially recorded among the Nahua (Aztec), peoples tell that there were no survivors of the flood and creation had to start from scratch, while other accounts relate that current humans are descended from a small number of survivors. In some accounts the survivors transgress against the gods by lighting a fire and consequently are turned into animals. Horcasitas acknowledges that the dog-wife tale and the tale of transgression by fire and subsequent turning into animals of the flood survivors may be of pre-Columbian origin.Horcasitas 1988: 215 Notes References  * Flood myths Flood Myths ","title":"Mesoamerican flood myths"},{"id":"29007540","text":"Constance Mabel Winchell (November 2, 1896 ‚Äì May 23, 1983)\\"Constance M(abel) Winchell.\\" Contemporary Authors Online.

She is best remembered for producing the seventh and eighth editions of the Guide to Reference Books. In 1999, American Libraries included Constance Winchell in a list of 100 most influential individuals in the field of library and information science.Kniffel, L., & Sullivan, P., & McCormick E: (1999). \\"100 of the most important leaders of the 20th century\\". American Libraries, 30 (11), 38. Early life Constance Winchell was born on November 2, 1896. Her family lived in Northampton, Massachusetts. Tragically, Winchell's father died early, when Constance was only seven years old.Newton Horace Winchell and Winchell, Alexander Newton (1917). \\"The Winchell Genealogy\\", 2nd Ed. (pp. 423-424).

(ed.), Supplement to the Dictionary of American Library Biography (pp. 163-165). Englewood, CO: Libraries Unlimited. Despite these difficulties, Winchell's education was never jeopardized. Winchell's family valued learning and education. Many of her relatives were college graduates and scholars, despite the relative rarity of obtaining an advanced degree in the early twentieth century. Winchell's future career was further influenced by her aunt Mabel Winchell who was a librarian in New Hampshire. Additionally, her mother occasionally rented rooms to lecturers from a local college to support the family. The presence of these educated borders further encouraged the Winchell children to explore the world of ideas and academic pursuits. Education Winchell attended a private high school called the Capen School. Later that year, her family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. In Ann Arbor, Winchell enrolled in classes at the University of Michigan. During the summers of her junior and senior years at Michigan, she attended library science lectures, which were conducted by Michigan's library director William Warner Bishop. Winchell earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. With Bishop's encouragement, Winchell enrolled in the library school program offered at the New York Public Library the following year. Although the program was two years, the second year was optional. Due to monetary concerns Winchell opted to complete only the first year of the program. She received a certificate in 1920. In 1928, after Winchell had accepted a position at Columbia University, she enrolled in Columbia's School of Library Service. Her thesis was called ‚ÄúLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan.‚Äù The essay encompassed much of the knowledge that her employer and professor Isadore Gilbert Mudge had acquired while supplying interlibrary loans over the course of her career.Wedgeworth, R. (1993). \\"Winchell, Constance M.\\" In Wedgeworth, Robert (ed.), World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services (pp. 867-868). Chicago, IL: American Library Association. Winchell's essay was well received upon its publication in 1930, and was recognized by many librarians to be one of the definitive books on interlibrary loans for many years. Winchell received a master's degree in Library Service in 1930. Early career Winchell knew early in life that she wanted to become a librarian. Her first library job was obtained in the University of Michigan library during her undergraduate years. She helped to improve the library catalog and provided reference services at some of the departmental libraries. Her first professional job was as the librarian of Duluth Minnesota's Central High School. She also taught ancient history classes while she was employed at Central High. Winchell only held this position for a year, before moving to New York to attend library school. After receiving her Library Science certificate, Winchell took at job with the United States Merchant Marine. This position required Winchell to travel extensively on the coast of the Eastern United States, where she was responsible for creating- and acquiring books for- lighthouse libraries. This position lasted for five months, at which time Winchell moved back to Ann Arbor to join the University of Michigan library staff. During the three years that Winchell was employed by Michigan she worked in the cataloging department, and later as a reference assistant. Winchell next accepted a job at the American Library in Paris, France. Here, she spent a year and a half working as the head catalogue librarian. Columbia and later career In the autumn of 1925, Winchell returned to the United States to accept a job at the Columbia University Library. Upon the publication of her master's thesis ‚ÄúLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan‚Äù in 1930, Winchell was made responsible for Columbia's interlibrary loans. Three years later, in 1933, Winchell became the assistant reference librarian. In 1941, Winchell was promoted to the head of reference. Winchell continued to serve as Columbia's head reference librarian until her retirement on June 30, 1962. In 1960 Winchell was the second person to receive the Isadore Gilbert Mudge Citation for Distinguished Contributions to Reference Librarianship. The award was presented by the American Library Association's Reference Service Division. This accolade was bestowed upon Winchell as a result of her work developing Columbia's reference collection and for her 1930 thesis book ‚ÄúLocating Books for Interlibrary Loan.‚Äù Winchell contributed to the library profession in other ways. She taught library science classes while working at Columbia. She was an active member of the American Library Association for many years, eventually obtaining membership on the organization's council; and she wrote semi-annual articles for College & Research Libraries, the first of which appeared in 1951. The Guide to Reference Books Winchell is best remembered for publishing the seventh and eighth editions of the Guide to Reference Books. The Guide to Reference Books was a bibliography of more than 8,000 books that was an important resource for developing the reference collections of many libraries.Constance M. Winchell retired on June 30. (1962). Wilson Library Bulletin, 37, Spring, 18. Retrieved September 19, 2010 from WilsonWeb. The books included in the Guide were about many different subjects, and they were in a variety of languages. The first edition of the Guide was published by Alice Bertha Kroeger in 1902. After publishing a second edition, Kroeger bequeathed the project to Isadore Gilbert Mudge. Mudge was responsible for producing the third through the sixth editions of the Guide to Reference Books. She also produced five supplements to each edition, which were published in Library Journal. Mudge was Constance Winchell's boss, professor, and colleague at Columbia University. Beginning with one of the supplements to the fifth edition, Winchell helped Mudge to edit the Guide. When Mudge retired in 1941, her position as Columbia's head reference librarian was vacated. Winchell was promoted to this position, and she assumed editorship of the Guide to Reference Books at the same time. Winchell edited and published the seventh edition of the Guide in 1951. This edition expanded the book in many subjects, but most apparently in ‚Äúpsychology, fine arts, and history.‚Äù She produced four supplements to the seventh edition, which appeared in 1954, 1956, 1960, and 1963. The eighth edition was published in 1967, five years after Winchell's official retirement from Columbia University. The eighth edition further expanded the contents of the Guide; it included 2,000 new books. Winchell also reorganized the structure of the Guide to include five general subject areas, as opposed to the thirteen areas included in earlier editions. The importance of Winchell's contributions to the Guide to Reference Books cannot be overstated. In the 1960s Winchell's name became synonymous with the Guide, and librarians frequently referred to the book as ‚ÄúWinchell.‚Äù Furthermore, the changes that Winchell made to the guide would impact ‚Äútwo generations of reference [librarians].‚Äù Later life As early as 1924, when she accepted the cataloging position in the American library in Paris, Winchell recognized a desire to travel. But she was not able to indulge in this passion until late in her career, and after her retirement from Columbia. Not long before retiring, she took a four-month leave from Columbia to travel extensively through Asia. She also visited such disparate foreign lands as Central and South America, the Middle East, and India. In 1969 Winchell moved to New Paltz, New York. Winchell continued to reside in New Paltz until her death on May 23, 1983 at the age of 86.Constance Winchell of Columbia University. (1983, May 25). New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)).

However he was financially ruined in 1772 by the demise of Douglas, Heron & Co, a bank in Ayr in which he was a partner. As a member of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society when it was awarded a royal charter in 1783, he automatically became a founding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He has refereed numerous international economic journals. Predictions Kelly predicted in 2006 that property prices were going to crash by 50% based on empirical evidence of past property crashes. Kelly has garnered praise from fellow economists for his prediction of the collapse of the property market. In July 2007, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern implicitly criticised Kelly for his articles predicting a property crash: > Sitting on the sidelines, cribbing and moaning is a lost opportunity. I > don't know how people who engage in that don't commit suicide because > frankly the only thing that motivates me is being able to actively change > something. Ahern subsequently apologised for the reference to suicide in his remark.Freefall, RT√â Television. Broadcast September 2010.) Kelly takes the view that the Irish state should not have put itself forward as guarantor for the Irish banks in September 2008. As of May 2011, Kelly suggests that bankruptcy for the state of Ireland is a possibility.

Carlton Hill is an inner-city area of Brighton, part of the English city and seaside resort of Brighton and Hove. First developed in the early and mid-19th century on steeply sloping farmland east of central Brighton, it grew rapidly as the town became a fashionable, high- class destination. Carlton Hill's population was always poor, though, and by the early 20th century the area was Brighton's worst slum: overcrowding, crime and disease were rife. Extensive slum clearance in the mid-20th century introduced high-density tower blocks, but some old buildings remain: in 2008, Brighton and Hove City Council designated part of Carlton Hill as the city's 34th conservation area. The area now has housing of various styles and ages, large offices and small-scale industry; there are also churches, a school and some open space. Carlton Hill's pattern of development was defined by the long-established structure of land ownership around Brighton, whereby land was divided into long, narrow strips with many different owners. This encouraged the development of terraced housing‚Äîthe predominant housing pattern until the council undertook large-scale demolition and high-density rebuilding in the mid-20th century. This work introduced more open space and varied land uses: Brighton Art College was able to expand into the area, and American Express opened a large, visually dominant headquarters. Buildings lost during the 20th century include schools and several chapels serving various Christian denominations. The former St John the Evangelist's Anglican church was declared redundant and sold to Brighton's Greek Orthodox community; meanwhile, a distinctive Modernist church was built in the 1960s for Spiritualists. A cluster of historic early 19th-century houses and other structures survived the redevelopment, and several were awarded listed status by English Heritage. These buildings and their surroundings were afforded further protection in 2008 when the city council designated the Carlton Hill conservation area. Location St Peter's and St Bartholomew's Churches, the New England Quarter and the approaches to Brighton railway station are visible in this view looking northwest over the 1960s flats of Nelson Place Carlton Hill stands on high ground immediately east of the centre of Brighton. Its western boundary, Grand Parade, is part of the main road to London; Edward Street, a major road leading towards Kemp Town and the eastbound coast road, forms the southern boundary; the Queen's Park residential area is to the east; and the densely populated terraced housing of Hanover lies to the north. The main road through the area runs from west to east and is also called Carlton Hill. Albion Hill, another steeply sloping west‚Äìeast road, forms the northern boundary between Hanover and Carlton Hill; the area north of Sussex Street is sometimes referred to as Albion Hill. The high ground of the area reaches a summit of at Windmill Terrace, between Albion Hill and Richmond Street. The latter was Brighton's steepest road until redevelopment in the 1960s severed it: its 1:5 gradient necessitated a full-width wall halfway along, to intercept runaway handcarts and other vehicles. The area is not prominent on Brighton's skyline, but good views are possible from its streets, especially westwards and southwestwards towards the sea and across the valley floor in which Old Steine and the old town are situated. Tarner Park, an open space in the centre of the conservation area, offers long views through nearly 180¬∞. History The former Mighell Farmhouse stands on the stub of Mighell Street. Amex House now occupies the rest of the site. The Milner Flats were the first flats built by the council in Brighton. The Circus Street Municipal Market operated from 1937 until 2005. Ecclesden is one of seven 11-storey blocks of flats on Grove Hill and Ashton Rise. Brighton's origins lie in the Saxon fishing and agricultural village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs‚Äîwide parallel strips‚Äîand paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton. Hilly Laine was one of Brighton's five laines. It was northeast of the Steine (later called Old Steine), the centre of fashionable society in the 18th century, and rose steeply eastwards from an area of sheltered flatter land close to the Steine. Some fields were used for small-scale activities such as limeburning and market gardening, but most were farmed by individuals. The laine had several furlongs; the second of these, which now forms the heart of the conservation area, was separated from its neighbours by leakways which became Carlton Hill (the road) and Sussex Street. Much of the land in this area was owned by Dr Benjamin Scutt, whose landholdings extended into the neighbouring village of Hove (the Brunswick estate was built on land he sold in the 1820s). Starting around 1800, the land was gradually sold to developers; Edward Street was laid out in 1804 and quickly experienced a \\"mini building boom\\" with inns, stables and small workshops. John Street, on the first (westernmost) furlong of Hilly Laine, was built up by 1810: its developer, John Hall, laid out plots for houses and started building and selling them in 1805. Carlton Street, by another developer, followed by 1807. Meanwhile, development continued slowly on the second furlong: four paul-pieces were occupied with buildings by 1819. Scutt's land sales helped him fund the development of Carlton Place, an architectural set-piece consisting of a 20-house terrace surrounding a riding school, the Royal Circus; the development took place between 1806 and 1808. Named after Carlton House, the Prince Regent's London home, the development was on a larger scale than the rest of Carlton Hill's houses: each plot measured . Each cost about ¬£410 (¬£ in ) to build, and proved to be profitable: one sold for ¬£700 (¬£ in ) in 1806 to a local vicar, who later bought two more to rent out. A survey of the town's housing by the Brighton Town Commissioners in 1814 valued Carlton Place within the top 25% of all houses in Brighton. Scutt laid out three more streets nearby at the same time: Carlton Mews, Carlton Row and Woburn Place were narrow roads crowded with small houses, stables and workshops. Meanwhile, a farmhouse was built at an unknown time in the early 19th century on nearby Mighell Street; it may have moved from agricultural to residential and commercial use later that century, and has an obscure early history. Built as Patriot Place in the mid-1810s, Tilbury Place (renamed in the 1860s) and its five houses stood next to the farm and formed a pocket of high-class residential development in a mostly working-class area of small houses. Number 1, also called St John's Lodge, was the largest, and was built for Edward Tarner (a merchant) and his wife Letitia, whose maiden name was Tilbury. It passed through the family until 1933, when Letitia Tilbury Tarner, a descendant, left it to her cousin Clara Isabella Bryan, who sold it in 1938 to Brighton Corporation for charitable purposes. It was converted into Tarner Home, a nursing and care institute for poor people, and later became a hostel. Nos 1-5 Tilbury Place are now owned by a housing association and used as housing. White Street's red-brick houses date from the 1880s. Apart from some land north of Sussex Street that remained agricultural until the 20th century, the whole hillside was covered with (mostly terraced) houses, small workshops and industrial structures, inns and other modest buildings by the mid-19th century. As early as 1840, the area was considered to be affected by poverty and its high population density. Brighton Corporation undertook some slum clearance in the 1880s, when White and Blaker Streets were laid out between Carlton Hill and Edward Street. By this time, Carlton Hill was known as Brighton's \\"foreign quarter\\", where many Italian and French street vendors‚Äîwho sold food of various types on Brighton beach, in the town centre and from door to door‚Äîsettled. Brighton's fishing industry still thrived into the early 20th century, and many fishermen lived in Carlton Hill and used its workshops and warehouses to cure and smoke their herring catches. A contemporary writer, quoted by Brighton historian Clifford Musgrave, observed that \\"an aromatic and appetising pall would envelop the entire neighbourhood, kippering both fish and residents alike\\". In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living standards were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until the start of World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats‚ÄîBrighton Corporation's first council flats‚Äîwere built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand on the site of Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site of Nelson Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place. The Morley Street Infant Welfare Clinic was built by Brighton Corporation in 1938. The Corporation also provided non-residential buildings on the cleared land. The Circus Street Municipal Market, on a wide street built behind Scutt's Royal Circus riding school, opened in January 1937 and became one of Brighton's main markets. A former chapel and many terraced houses had stood on the site, whose redevelopment cost ¬£75,000 (¬£ in ). A fish market, moved from a site near the beach, was added in 1960. The building closed in 2005 and has been empty since then, apart from its use as a temporary exhibition centre during the 2009 Brighton Festival‚Äîwhen sculptor Anish Kapoor showed a new work there. Two clinics, specialising in chest complaints and child welfare, opened on the north side of Sussex Street, opposite the market, in 1936 and 1938 respectively. The chest clinic closed in 1989. The lower part of Sussex Street was renamed Morley Street at this time. Brighton Corporation compulsorily purchased Carlton Place in about 1955 and demolished the houses and former riding school in favour of new housing. John Street became the site of two important civic buildings in the mid-1960s: Brighton's central police station was opened in 1965, followed by the new county court building two years later. Clearances around Albion Hill began in the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely populated terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks‚ÄîBrighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed as part of this redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and new roads (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the tower blocks and across the slope of the hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood Street when it was redeveloped in the 1960s: Brighton Art College (now part of the University of Brighton) was extended in 1967 by Brighton borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot. In the mid-1970s, American Express sought land in Brighton to build a new European headquarters. The company had a long association with Sussex, and opened a mechanical accounting centre in a building on Edward Street in 1968. Most of Mighell Street and all of its buildings‚Äîexcept the old farmhouse‚Äîand some neighbouring streets were demolished and replaced by the Amex House, a nine-storey office building designed by American architecture firm Gollins, Melvin, Ward and Partners. A legislative order was raised by the Secretary of State for the Environment in mid-1973 to allow Mighell Street to be severed. In September 2008, American Express announced plans to demolish and replace the building. The new office is set slightly further back, closer to Carlton Hill (the road), and better road access will be provided by means of a new entrance from John Street. The city council granted planning permission in November 2009, and preliminary building work started in early 2010. The work was completed in 2012 and the old Amex House was demolished in 2017. Buildings =Churches= Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity was established in 1986 in this former Anglican church of 1838. The Brighton and Hove National Spiritualist Church stands on Edward Street. Early in its development, Carlton Hill was provided with an Anglican church. St John the Evangelist's Church, opposite the junction of Carlton Hill and White Street, was designed by George Cheesman junior in a \\"strangely bleak\\" Greek Revival/Neo-Georgian style in 1838, with Doric columns and a stuccoed and pedimented fa√ßade. Never successful in attracting large congregations, it was declared redundant by the Diocese of Chichester in 1980. Proposals for its conversion into a drug detoxification centre were opposed, and in March 1986 the Greek Orthodox community, which had been worshipping elsewhere in Brighton, bought the church and rededicated it as the Church of the Holy Trinity. The building was severely damaged by fire in July 2010. The Ebenezer Reformed Baptist Church has occupied three buildings on two different sites in Carlton Hill. It was founded in 1825, and the first service was held on 13 April of that year in a stuccoed Renaissance-style building on the north side of Richmond Street. The chapel, with prominently displayed on its entablature, was locally nicknamed \\"The Lemon Squeezer\\". It was demolished in 1966 during the redevelopment of the Richmond Street area. Architect C.J. Wood built a new church in the Vernacular style on the opposite side of Richmond Parade, backing on to Ivory Place, in the same year. It was in turn demolished in 2007, and a six-storey block of flats with a new church on the ground floor was built in its place. This opened in August 2010. Five other chapels were demolished during the area's 20th-century redevelopment. The Sussex Street Strict Baptist Chapel stood on the section of that road which is now named Morley Street. It had lancet windows and a stuccoed exterior, and opened in 1867. The congregation moved out in 1895, and St Margaret's Church in Cannon Place established a mission hall in the building. The Circus Street market was built on the site after its demolition in 1937. Also on Sussex Street, a Primitive Methodist chapel was founded in 1836. The Kingswood Flats now occupy the site of the building, which closed in about 1950. Mighell Street Hall, demolished in 1965, stood on land now covered by Amex House. It was used by Baptists from 1878, then as the church hall of St John the Evangelist's, and finally (from January 1949) by Spiritualists. When the new Brighton National Spiritualist Church, a figure-of-eight concrete building, opened on Edward Street in 1965, the hall closed for good. The Carlton Hill Apostolic Church stood for 99 years until 1964, although its Catholic Apostolic congregation moved out in 1954. Latterly it was used as student housing for the adjacent Brighton Art College, which extended its premises onto the site when the building was demolished. The Salvation Army had a citadel at the junction of Edward Street and the now vanished Riding School Lane (near Mighell Street) from 1884 until 1965, when it was demolished for road widening. The denomination registered another building for worship and marriages in 1971: it stood at the junction of Carlton Hill and Mighell Street, and was deregistered in 1985. =Schools= Carlton Hill Primary School was built by the Local education authority in 1963. It is on the boundary of the conservation area, between Sussex Street and Carlton Hill (the road) on the west side of Tilbury Place, and is well screened by trees. It has a tall wooden fence that, according to the council's Conservation Area Character Statement, \\"visually intrudes on the approach to the conservation area and harms its setting\\". It recommends replacing the fence with a flint wall. The school adjoins the site that is being redeveloped for the new American Express headquarters: the company paid the school ¬£300,000 (a condition of the council's approval of the planning application) to compensate for the effect on its playground, which will be overlooked by the building, and the building contractor Sir Robert McAlpine has paid for a school crossing patrol officer to help children cross Carlton Hill safely during the construction period. Several schools were founded in the mid-19th century. A Ragged Schools Union school stood on Carlton Street from the mid-1850s, and St John the Evangelist's Church established its own school in 1870 on Carlton Hill. This was rebuilt in 1914, and later housed the American Express social club until its demolition in early 2010. Board schools were set up in 1873 on Richmond Street and 1883 on Circus Street. The Richmond Street school was the first in Brighton to offer school meals. The two Board schools merged in 1926 and took the name Sussex Street School, after which the Circus Street building closed. It was later sold to Brighton Polytechnic (now the University of Brighton). The Richmond Street school ran along the west side of Claremont Row between Richmond and Sussex Streets; playgrounds separated the boys' and girls' sections. In October 1930, a nursery section was added. The school was compulsorily purchased in 1959 and demolished for redevelopment; Carlton Hill Primary School was built to replace it. The Margaret Macmillan Open Air Nursery was built on part of the grounds of number 1 Tilbury Place in the 1930s, partly funded by Letitia Tilbury Tarner, who had sold the land required to the Brighton and Hove Nursery Schools Association in 1931, and bequeathed ¬£800 to the association in her will. A nursery school still stands on the site. =Civic, commercial and public buildings= Amex House, a nine-storey office block, opened in 1977. Amex House (demolished 2017) was said to \\"dominates the sweep of Carlton Hill\\" and was visible on the skyline from much of Brighton. Designed by British architecture firm Gollins Melvin and Ward,Architecture of the Gollins Melvin Ward Partnership ‚Äì Lund Humphries 1974 ‚Äì the building had prominent white horizontal bands of glass-reinforced plastic and blue-tinted glazing, and its corners were chamfered to give it a more rounded appearance. It was nicknamed \\"The Wedding Cake\\", and its clean, futuristic design has been said to evoke Thunderbirds. It was replaced as the headquarters of American Express in 2012 by a new building on a neighbouring site, named 1 St Johns Place. Prior House, at the north end of Tilbury Place, was built in 1936 for the Brighton Girls' Club. This institution was founded in 1928 at Nelson Row, and was displaced from its original premises in 1934 when the Kingswood Flats were built on the site. In 1970, Prior House became a remedial education centre. Since 1985, it has been shared by Brighton Unemployed Centre Families Project, offering education and other social facilities for unemployed people and the Resource Centre, a local organisation formed in 1975 which provides practical resources for community and voluntary groups. The Workers' Educational Association also used part of the building from 1985 until the early 1990s. Architecturally, it is a plain red-brick building with a large stuccoed extension on the second floor, affecting the ambience of Tilbury Place and the neighbouring listed buildings. The former vicarage of St John the Evangelist's Church, opposite the church on the south side of Carlton Hill, has been converted into an office. It dates from 1899 and is domestic in character, with bay windows containing original sashes, red-brick walls and a steeply pitched roof. It is within the conservation area and is considered to make a \\"positive contribution\\" to its character. Another building formerly associated with the church is the Edward Riley Memorial Hall, now named the Carlton Hill Centre. It has a steep clay-tiled roof and brown brickwork. The high flint walls around it are described as a positive feature of the conservation area, although the building itself has a \\"neutral effect\\" according to the council's character statement. The building was used as the church hall until the church closed in 1980; the Chichester Diocesan Centre for the Deaf was then established in it. It is currently the Autism Sussex Day Centre. =Listed buildings= Number 1 Tilbury Place is a Georgian-style townhouse. A building or structure is defined as \\"listed\\" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of \\"special architectural or historic interest\\" by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. In February 2001, there were 24 listed buildings with Grade I status, 70 Grade II*-listed and 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings in Brighton and Hove. Grade I-listed buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance; Grade II*, the next highest status, is used for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\"; and the lowest grade, Grade II, is used for \\"nationally important buildings of special interest\\". This flint structure in Tarner Park was originally an observation tower. Carlton Hill has nine listed buildings (covered by five separate listings), all of which have Grade II status and lie within the conservation area. Number 1 Tilbury Place (St John's Lodge) is listed together with its surrounding railings, garden wall and garden porch. The four neighbouring and contemporary houses at 2‚Äì5 Tilbury Place are also listed together under a single Grade II designation. Described by the council as an \\"impressive warm brick terrace\\" of \\"elegant townhouses\\", they were much larger than the surrounding houses‚Äîespecially number 1, which also had extensive gardens. Number 5 is also slightly larger than the others, and originally had stables adjacent. They are in the Georgian style, built of pale yellow brick laid in the Flemish bond pattern. The roofs are slate-tiled, but some are hidden behind parapets. The entrance doors have decorated fanlights and original windows with ogee-shaped cast-iron miniature balconies. All five houses are now owned by a housing association and have been divided into flats. The former St John the Evangelist's Church was listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is a Greek Revival-style stucco-clad building of stone and brick with a partly hipped roof. The three-bay fa√ßade has four Tuscan pilasters beneath a substantial entablature and pediment. The frieze between them has metopes and triglyphs. Work by L.A. Mackintosh in 1957 altered the exterior; the architect added his personal monogram and an eagle emblem (representing John the Evangelist) above the left and right entrances respectively. Numbers 34 and 35 Mighell Street (the former Mighell Farmhouse) were jointly listed on 13 October 1952. Described as a \\"surprising survival\\", the now semi-detached house is a two-storey cobble-fronted building with a prominent porch framed by Tuscan columns and topped by an entablature with a frieze and triglyph and a decorated pediment. An arched doorway with a keystone has a 19th-century panelled door set into it, and the sash windows are also original and have similar arched surrounds made of bricks. The roof is tiled and has chimneys at each end. The farmhouse's origins are unknown, although a Philip Mighell was a major landowner on Hilly Laine in the late 18th century, when some of the paul-pieces bore his name. The building was apparently at least partly in commercial use by 1865. In Tarner Park, an area of open space formed from part of number 1 Tilbury Place's grounds, there is a circular tower which is believed to have been built by Edward Tilbury Tarner (son of the original occupants Edward and Laetitia Tarner) as an observation tower so he could see ships in the English Channel. The mid-19th-century structure has two storeys and about 70 steps; the upper level is recessed and has a walkway around it. The walls are of knapped flint with some brick and stonework. Part of an iron weather vane remains at the top. Both storeys have segmental-arched entrances, but these are now closed. The structure is in good condition but has some missing flints. Conservation area High flint boundary walls characterise the conservation area. In the United Kingdom, a conservation area is a principally urban area \\"of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance\\". Such areas are identified by local authorities according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. On 4 July 2008, at the heart of Carlton Hill was designated as the city of Brighton and Hove's 34th conservation area. Its boundaries are (clockwise from north) Sussex Street, St John's Place, Carlton Hill (including the stub of Mighell Street) and Tilbury Place, with the open space of Tarner Park at the centre. All of Carlton Hill's listed buildings are within the designated area; these, combined with the sheltered open space of Tarner Park, substantial tree cover, the survival of old street patterns and boundary walls, and the distinctive lie of the land, contribute to the area's \\"special character\\", as defined by Brighton and Hove City Council. The area does not have a unified appearance or structure, owing to the large-scale redevelopment carried out in the 20th century. Instead, a \\"disparate group of individually interesting buildings\\" and small spaces define the area; together, they form \\"a fragment of early 19th-century Brighton\\". Flint and brown or yellow brick is used extensively, both for buildings within the conservation area and in associated structures such as boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are of granite, limestone and flint, while some high- quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.

It is located in Elij√§rvi, in the municipality of Keminmaa, to the north of Kemi. The Kemi Mine is the largest underground mine in Finland, with an annual production capacity of 2.7 million tonnes of ore. It is also part of the integrated ferrochrome and stainless steel manufacturing chain owned by Outokumpu in the Kemi-Tornio region. The Kemi Mine has approximately 400 employees every day, both employees of Outokumpu and contractors. The purpose of the Kemi Mine in the long production chain from chromite ore to stainless steel is to produce concentrates from ore as raw material for the manufacture of ferrochrome at the ferrochrome plant located in Tornio. The chrome contained in the ferrochrome generated as a product at the ferrochrome plant ‚Äì used as an alloying material in the steel manufacturing process ‚Äì is what makes the steel manufactured at the Tornio steel plant stainless. Operational safety, cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness are characteristics of the Kemi Mine. Low accident figures, together with clean and properly organized working environments, both 500 meters underground and on the surface, make an excellent setting for effective production, modern technological applications and the use of advanced working methods. Operations cause only a minor environmental impact because of the insolubility of the oxidic chromite ore, the chemical-free concentration method based on gravity, and the sealed process water circulation covering the entire mine and concentration process.  History  Signs of the existence of a chromite ore body were first discovered by amateur diver Martti Matilainen. Of the samples he sent to the Geological Survey of Finland, one was discovered to be high in chrome content on 30 June 1959. The sample was taken from the current mine area, and the ore deposit was discovered by the next spring. Geologist Aarno Kahma led the exploration. After its baseline study, the Geological Survey of Finland handed over the deposit to Outokumpu Oy, which continued the survey until 1962. At the time, the size of the ore body was estimated to be 30 million tonnes. In autumn 1964, Outokumpu decided to start utilizing the chrome deposit in Kemi and started to build a road from Perta-aapa to Elij√§rvi in autumn 1965. At the same time, earth-moving work began in the future mine area. The first mine buildings were completed late in 1966.Hedman, Ossi: Kemin kaupungin historia (History of the City of Kemi). 1st section, pp. 640‚Äì644. Tampere: Kustannusosakeyhti√∂ Sanan Tien kohopaino, 1969. The Kemi Mine opened in 1968. Initially, it operated as an open-pit mine. In the same year, the Tornio ferrochrome plant also started operating, with the first liquid metal pouring from the ferrochrome furnace (VKU1) taking place in August. The excavation and construction of the underground mine started in 1999. Open-pit mining ended at the Kemi Mine in December 2005 with the final open-pit blasting.  Ore body  The Kemi Mine is the only chromium mine in the European Union. Currently, the mine extracts 2.4 million tonnes of chrome ore per year. The verified size of the ore body is approximately 50 million tonnes. In addition, the volume of mineral reserves is approximately 98 million tonnes, having been evaluated to a depth of one kilometre. The deposit, with an average thickness of 40 meters, is nearly vertical and approximately one kilometer in length. The depth of the ore deposit remains unclear. The ore contains 26% chromium oxide with a chrome to iron ratio of 1.6. According to the survey report by the Geological Survey of Finland, the chrome ore deposit extends to a depth of two to three kilometres, possible even to four kilometres. Previously, it was estimated that the ore and mineral reserves in Kemi would be sufficient for 70‚Äì80 years, but on the basis of more recent information, it is possible that there will be extractable ore for hundreds of years, even after the planned doubling of production. In terms of excavated volume, the mine, which opened in 1968, is among the largest in Finland, with an annual excavated volume of 2.4 million tonnes of ore. By the end of 2005, a total of 31.4 million tonnes of chromite ore had been extracted from various open-pit mines. Opened in 2003, the underground mine had produced 10.6 million tonnes of chromite ore by the end of 2013.A memorystone was erected in the exact location where the first sample of chromite ore was found on 15 June 1959. The Mine was open six years later. Text in English: \\"From this location found diver Martti Matilainen 15 June 1959 a chromite malm stone, that lead to opening of Kemi Mine and Tornio Steel factory.\\"  Ore production  Chromite ore was extracted from open-pit mines reaching depths of approximately 200 meters until 2005. In 2003, underground mining began. The underground mine is accessible either via an incline ramp or a mine shaft. Ore extraction started at level 500, from which the process proceeds upwards towards the bottom of the open-pit. Fully excavated primary stopes are filled with waste rock. From each stope, the ore is carried to an underground crushing station. The crushed ore is transferred via a conveyor belt to crushed ore silos located close to the mine shaft and further to a skip via a measuring pocket. The ore is hoisted through the shaft to an unloading silo located in a 70-meter-tall lifting tower, from where it is forwarded to the concentration process. Maintenance of the underground movable machinery takes place underground, where the facilities and equipment required for water extraction, ventilation, electrification, communication and other infrastructure are also located. In addition to the currently active Elij√§rvi and Viia ore bodies, underground mining is beginning in the Surmaoja ore body alongside the other two ore bodies from level 500 upwards. Because of the mining method used, the ore extraction process in each ore body always proceeds upwards towards the bottom of the open-pit mine, while filling fully extracted areas with waste rock.  Concentrate production  Ore is concentrated at two concentration plants located at the Kemi Mine into lump and fine concentrate. In the first phase, the ore is crushed for further processing. At the lump concentration plant, lump concentrate is separated from the crushed ore using the sink-and-float method. The grain size is 12‚Äì100 mm. After grinding, feed material from the fine concentration plant is concentrated into fine concentrate using spiral separators. At the fine concentration plant, the ore is concentrated into fine concentrate using gravitational and highly magnetic concentration methods. The annual production capacity of lump concentrate is approximately 400,000 tonnes and that of fine concentrate is approximately 850,000 tonnes. The content of chromium oxide in the concentrates is 36% and 45%, respectively. The concentrate is carried to the Tornio ferrochrome plant by road transportation. The Kemi Mine is accessible by rail from the Oulu‚ÄìTornio track via a connection known as the ‚ÄúElij√§rvi mine track‚Äù: Rail transportation of ore ended on 31 December 2005 when a local road transportation entrepreneur made a better offer for the transportation of ore between the Kemi Mine and the Tornio plant.

Originally either the property of a local notable or attached to a larger church, it was constructed anytime from the 11th to the 14th century. The church was built using red bricks and white mortar. Architecturally, it is of a simple Byzantine cross- in-square design, with a single nave and apse. The frescoes in the interior are only scarcely preserved. It was reconstructed in 1937 after falling into ruin, and it was listed as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968. History Scholars disagree on the possible period of the church's construction; assessments range from the 11th‚Äì12th, through the 12th‚Äì13th, to the 13th‚Äì14th century. In an article in the Bulgarian Church Review magazine from 1898, the local priest Mihal Popov was cited as saying that a stone from the church altar was unearthed during excavations. The priest believed that the stone, which reportedly had the date 1160 inscribed on it, was sent to the National Archaeological Museum in the capital Sofia. Due to its diminutive size, the Church of St Nicholas was probably not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to the name of an unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin. In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov also writes that at the time, the church lacked a roof. He references a story about a group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so they fled in horror. The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov. Architecture The Church of St Nicholas lies in the centre of Sapareva Banya. Its architecture is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height, though it is rather large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance is located on the west wall. The church was constructed out of rows of red bricks stuck together with white mortar. According to scholar Bistra Nikolova, its size is , while another source measures it as . Either way, it is square in appearance. In height, it probably reached at the dome and at the cornice. In terms of design and decoration, Mavrodinov likens the church to the Church of St Pantaleon in Gorno Nerezi near Skopje, today in North Macedonia. It is also compared to the Church of St Theodore in nearby Boboshevo. The Church of St Nicholas features a multitude of two-stepped vaults on its outside walls. The interior was originally entirely covered with frescoes, though only fragments survive. It was enlisted as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968, with a publication in Bulgaria's newspaper of record, the State Gazette, issue 77.

However, he jumped to the rival Pittsburgh Athletic Club in 1892. Valentine played for Pittsburgh in their first two games. Then, without warning, he suddenly jumped back to the Allegheny team. Some Pittsburgh A.C. members accused Allegheny of enticing him back, while others charged he had all along been a spy for them. During Allegheny's two games against the Pittsburgh A.C. that year, Valentine played as a left halfback. In 1891, he played in a game for Shadyside Academy as that team was defeated by the Pittsburgh A.C., 26‚Äì0. That same year, he scored a touchdown against the Greensburg Athletic Association, during a 10‚Äì5 Allegheny win. During a game against the Detroit Athletic Association on November 11, 1893, Valentine reportedly openly punched Detroit's quarterback so openly. The officials ignored the incident, and the Detroiter used the next play to retaliate against Valentine. Shortly after, a brawl between the two clubs erupted. Allegheny would go on to win the game 18‚Äì0. In 1894, during a game against the Pittsburgh A.C., Valentine was thrown out of the game after coming to the aid of James Van Cleve during a fight against Pittsburgh's Joe Trees. After several appeals, Valentine left the field reportedly \\"crying like a baby\\" by the local media. In 1895, Allegheny declined to field a team after learning of an investigation into the club by the Amateur Athletic Union, over reports that the team had been secretly paying players. As a result, Valentine became a referee. He officiated a game that year between the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and Greensburg. The game was filled with fights and arguments. Valentine refused to return to the game for the second half.

After a dispute with Malawi's autocratic President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, he and his wife Vera were exiled. After being kidnapped abroad they were tried in Malawi on charges of treason and sentenced to death. Amnesty International named the couple prisoners of conscience. After spending nearly eleven years on death row in Malawi, Orton Chirwa died in prison on 20 October 1992. Early life The early life of Orton Edgar Ching'oli Chirwa is sparsely documented. He was educated at Fort Hare University in South Africa.Short p. 60 In 1951 he wrote a long memorandum arguing against federation with Southern Rhodesia which was presented to Colonial Secretary James Griffiths and Commonwealth Relations Secretary Patrick Gordon-Walker during their visit to Nyasaland, in August and September 1951, to gauge Africans' sentiments on this subject. During the Lancaster House Conference convened in 1952 to discuss federation, wearing academic robes he \\"captivated crowds with his carefully argued attacks on the federal plan at village markets and meeting halls.\\"Power p. 60 He had by this time already been in correspondence for four years with Hastings Banda, who was to become the president of the country after independence.Short, p. 66, quoting Hansard Zomba 8 March 1963, p 659 Despite widespread opposition, Nyasaland was integrated into the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953. In 1954, Chirwa joined with Charles Matinga and Andrew Mponda in forming the short- lived Nyasaland Progressive Association, dedicated to working within the new reality of the federation.Power p. 143 During 1954 - 1956, approximately, Chirwa was an instructor at Domasi Teacher Training College, where, along with David Rubadiri and Alec Nyasulu, he reportedly was active in infusing his students with nationalist political consciousness.Power p. 111 Political life In 1959 the British Colonial Government banned the Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) and arrested most of the political party's leaders, including Orton Chirwa and Banda in a mass swoop known as Operation Sunrise. Orton Chirwa was detained in Khami Jail near Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia for a short time before, on 1 August 1959, being released. He became the first president of the Malawi Congress Party(MCP), a successor-party to the NAC formed on 30 September 1959. There was some opposition to this appointment, notably from Kanyama Chiume, who considered him tainted by his previous association with the Federation-tolerant Nyasaland Progressive Association. It has been suggested that the British government might have harbored hopes of Chirwa taking the leadership reins as a moderate nationalist, but it soon became clear that he was merely \\"keeping the seat warm\\" for Banda. In November 1959 when he visited Iain Macleod, the Colonial Secretary in the Conservative government under Harold Macmillan, he made clear that MCP would only negotiate independence with Banda as its head. Three days after Banda was released from Gwelo Prison on 2 April 1960, Orton Chirwa together with other NAC leaders invited him to stand for President of the MCP. Chirwa stood down and Dr. Banda took over the leadership of the Malawi Congress Party which subsequently led Malawi to independence in 1964. Harold MacMillan visited Nyasaland in 1960, and Chirwa organized a protest on 25 January in Blantyre which was noted in the British newspapers for its rowdiness.Power p. 144 During the run-up to elections in 1962 and again in 1963, he was vocal in his condemnation of attempts by other Africans to form political parties in opposition to the MCP, with himself and David Rubadira by this time openly advocating totalitarian rule by the MCP.Short p. 254 Orton Chirwa was named Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, (a position slightly short of Minister) in Dr. Banda's interim administration which took office in 1962.Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa, by Colin Baker, published by I. B. Tauris, London, 2000 In the run-up to the 1964 National Assembly elections, he was active in promoting the use of \\"traditional courts\\" as an alternative to the existing judiciary, a controversial move in that these courts were subject to significant political influence, and was heavily criticised by the Chief Justice for this and by the Governor, Glyn Jones, for failing to investigate and prosecute hundreds of cases of politically motivated intimidation, in the form of assaults, murders, arson and crop destruction, as well as cases of intimation against Jehovah's Witnesses.Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa, by Colin Baker, published by I. B. Tauris, London, 2000, p.185 et seq In 1963, he threatened to bring charges against the Nyasaland Times under the Sedition Act because of that newspaper's reporting on opposition political parties.Power p. 180 He became independent Malawi's Minister of Justice and Attorney General in 1964, but resigned after a short time along with other ministers in the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. Attempting a reconciliation with Banda in the aftermath, he was badly beaten up by Banda's bodyguard after a meeting with Banda at Government House.Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa, by Colin Baker, published by I. B. Tauris, London, 2000, page 241-2 On 23 October 1964, sub-Chief Timbiri from Chirwa's Nkahata Bay constituency, was murdered in Zomba. Police said they had evidence Chirwa was involved. He fled to Dar Es Salaam early in November, together with his wife, Vera Chirwa.Short, pp. 222-3 =Exile and capture= Forced by Banda's authoritarian policies to leave Malawi, the Chirwas settled in Tanzania where Orton taught and practised law. He formed a new political party, the Malawi Freedom Movement, which appears to have had little active support inside Malawi, a one-party state with Banda its president for life. During a visit to Zambia with their youngest son, Fumabani, the Chirwas were kidnapped and arrested on Christmas Eve 1981 in eastern Zambia by Malawi security forces and taken back to Malawi on charges of high treason, although it was alleged they were trying to enter Malawi. =Trial= Ironically, the Chirwas were tried by a \\"traditional\\" court of the kind whose introduction Orton himself had championed in 1962. Both lawyers, they conducted their own defence as traditional courts did not allow defence lawyers in a trial lasting two months in front of judges appointed by Dr. Banda. This case demonstrated the deficiencies in the system. At the end of their appeal in 1983, the minority of the appellate judges that had legal training opposed the guilty verdict, but it was over-ruled by the majority composed of traditional chiefs.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, Human Rights Watch, p. 32. ISBN 978- 0-92969-273-9 At their trial, the Chirwas claimed that they had been abducted from Zambia in December 1981. This, and the charge that they had conspired to overthrow the government outside Malawi, should have meant that the traditional courts had no jurisdiction. The case could still have been heard in Malawi‚Äôs High Court, but that court required proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The treason case heard against the Chirwas by the Southern Region Traditional Court in 1983 was based on handwritten documents said to have been found on them when arrested, and a police officer‚Äôs \\"expert\\" testimony that they were indeed in Orton Chirwa‚Äôs handwriting. An unsigned statement said to have been made by Orton Chirwa, but repudiated by him, and a transcript said to have been made of a taped interview he had given were also admitted as evidence. The Chirwas were not allowed to call witnesses from outside Malawi and were both sentenced to death and taken to the central prison in Zomba.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, pp. 37‚Äì8. On the Chirwas' appeal to the National Traditional Court of Appeal, the refusal of the lower court to allow defence witnesses, its admission of the unsigned statement and its acceptance of a police officer as an expert witness were all criticised, and minority of the judges did not accept that creating unpublished handwritten documents amounted to treason. However the appeal court came to the startling conclusion that, even if the Traditional courts had no jurisdiction in law, they had a traditional right to try the Chirwas, and that (despite the deficiencies in the lower court‚Äôs handling of the case), their decision was correct and should stand. The death sentences were commuted, but Orton Chirwa later died in prison. Vera Chirwa was released from prison in 1993 after over 11 years in prison, mostly in solitary confinement.R Carver, (1990). Where Silence Rules: The Suppression of Dissent in Malawi, pp. 39‚Äì41. =Imprisonment and death= In Zomba Prison Orton Chirwa was held in solitary confinement and not allowed any outside contact. For eight years he was not even permitted to see his wife Vera who was being held in the same prison. In 1990 Amnesty International launched an investigation into their fate and named the couple prisoners of conscience. In autumn 1992, when a delegation of British legal experts was allowed to visit Orton and Vera at the prison, the Chirwas were able to meet again for the first time in 8 years. According to the British lawyers, at the time of the meeting he was partially deaf and blind due to untreated cataracts. Orton died in his cell 3 weeks later at the age of 73. =Family= Nkhondo Chirwa, second son of Orton and Vera, died unexpectedly on 18 October 2016 in Kendal, Cumbria, England, hometown for him and his children for many years. He is buried in Parkside cemetery Kendal. At his funeral tributes were paid to Amnesty International for their efforts on behalf of the Chirwa family. Orton Chirwa's grandson, Orton Ndau is also a lawyer. Orton Ndau graduated from the Howard University School of Law in 2011. Thereafter, Orton Ndau clerked for Kevin N. Fox, Chief Magistrate for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Orton Ndau is now a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP in New York.

These tasks included both musical and lyrical research and development, and also directing performances. The existence of a Music Bureau was typical of various Chinese dynasties, though the Music Bureau's prominence and influence may have peaked during the reign of Han dynasty emperor Wu, who was especially interested in such activities and engaged himself accordingly. The mission of the Music Bureau was concerned with poetry, music, and their live performances, because these concepts were not really considered to be distinct: lyrics are a part of music, and traditional Chinese poems, particularly shi, were considered to be suitable for chanting or singing, and poetic verses in accompaniment with instrumental music were often presented together as integral parts of performances. In the case of the Music Bureau, performances were oriented towards religious rites or entertainment in service to the emperor. The songs/poems collected or developed by the Han music bureau received the appellation of \\"yuefu\\"; but, eventually, the term \\"Music Bureau\\", or yuefu (also yueh-fu) also came to be applied to a category of Classical Chinese poetry which was based upon the standard forms and themes documented or promoted by the Music Bureau staff during the Han Dynasty. Known as yuefu (meaning \\"in the style of the Music Bureau poetry\\"), this type of poetry made major contributions to Han poetry, as well as the Jian'an poetry of the late Han and early Six Dynasties. There was also an important later Tang poetry literary revival of the yuefu poetic forms. Name The name of the Music Bureau and also the poetry collected, produced, or disseminated by it is sometime transliterated into English as yue fu. This \\"fu\\" is a different word than the name of the rhapsodic type of prose/verse fu (), which has tended to be likewise transliterated into English as \\"fu\\". Pre-history and mythology The earliest mentions of a government office of music or at least an official in charge of music or a department of music is found in Chinese mythology. Huang Di is claimed to have appointed a Governor of Music, named Ling Lun.Yang, 73 and 169-170 As Governor of Music, Linglun seems to have been charged with designing and overseeing the production of actual instruments, as well as the development of the musical scale. Emperor Shun is said to have founded a Ministry of Music, to which he appointed a Minister Kui to head. The main purpose of this institution was to teach the heirs apparent proper conduct and harmony (in both sense of the word), and as such it served as a mythological model for both the future Music Bureau and the imperial education system.Wu, 99 and 255-256 =Music Masters= Despite the paucity of evidence regarding the early or initial formation or formations of an actual imperial or royal Music Bureau, better evidence exists regarding the position of imperial or royal Music Master. But, whether the Music Master was the head of an organized governmental bureau or department or were just solo functionaries seems somewhat of an open question. In any case, certain of these early Music Masters are historically and culturally important; for example, Music Masters Shi Yan and Shi Kuang both appear in the Chu Ci poem \\"Leaving the World\\" (Li shi), from the Nine Laments section by Liu Xiang. Shi Yan Shi Yan was Music Master to Di Xin (r. 1075‚Äì1046 BCE), the last Shang dynasty ruler. A blind musician, Shi Yan was king Di Xin's Music Master during the end of his reign. According to legend (or Zhou propaganda from the succeeding dynasty) his reign was characterized by drinking, women, sex, and lack of morals, activities which Di Xin was said to prefer at this point in his career to spending his time in properly governing his country; he ignored almost all affairs of state, and was often too besotted even to keep track of what day it was. According to Sima Qian, Di Xin with his concubines (especially Daji) developed the habit of hosting festive orgies where many people engaged in sex at the same time and created songs with crude erotic lyrics and allegedly poor rhythm. However, after the Zhou Dynasty army defeated the Shang military power at the Battle of Muye, in 1046 BCE, Di Xin gathered up his treasures in his expensively-built palace and set a huge fire, burning himself up together with his luxurious possessions. After this, Shi Yan is supposed to have firmly grasped a-hold of his musical instrument and jumped to his suicidal death in the waters of the Pu River, where his ghostly music was heard playing centuries later.Hawkes, 303 and 335 Shi Kuang Shi Kuang (:zh:Â∏´Êõ† (Â∏àÊó∑)) was a 6th-century musician, and Music Master for the Duke of Jin. A blind musician, Shi Kuang attempted to prevent the Music Master of a visiting ruler from playing the ghostly music which the latter had heard while camping by the River Pu (the music of Shi Yan, above). After hearing just a few bars, Shi Kuang realized the dangerous quality of this tune, and tried to prevent the perilous continuation of play. The Duke of Jin, however, commanded that its play continue: thence a mighty wind arose sweeping the tiles from the roof of his palace, a three-year drought in his duchy commenced, and the duke himself contracted a debilitating disease from which he did not recover. History The documentary evidence is contradictory and unclear for when and by whom the Music Bureau was founded; however it is known to have existed during the Qin Dynasty (221‚Äì205 BCE), if not earlier.Yip, 66 Apparently, during the political and social turmoil during and after the fall of Qin (during the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention), the Music Bureau seems to have been discontinued, but it was later revived. The earliest known evidence for the existence of a specific governmental bureau of music appears to be an official seal of State Music Bureau of the state of Qi dating from the Warring States period (480‚Äì221 BCE).Birrell, 6 Certainly, the history of the Classic of Poetry seems to confirm the existence of some sort of official functionaries responsible for the collection of songs and poetry in the royal courts of the Zhou Dynasty and of Lu and other states of the Spring and Autumn period.Frankel, 215-216 and Yip, 31 The Music Bureau greatly flourished under Emperor Wu of Han (Wudi, reigned 141‚Äì87 BCE).Birrell, 5-6 Its first director under Wudi was Li Yannian. The emperor Wu has been widely cited to have created the Music Bureau in 120 BCE,Birrell, 7 however it seems most likely that there was a long-standing office of music and that as part of his governmental reorganization Wu enlarged its size, changed its scope and function, as well as possibly renaming it ‚Äì‚Äì thus seeming and being credited with establishing a new institution, the stated tasks of which were apparently to collect popular songs from various areas within the Han Empire, as well as external sources and to adapt and orchestrate these, as well as to develop new material.Birrell, 6-7 The historian Ban Gu states in his Book of Han that the Music Bureau was subordinate to the shaofu, or Lesser Treasury, which was responsible for the emperor's personal needs.Birrell, 6 and note 14 p. 175 Sima Qian in his Records of the Grand Historian states that the early Han emperors retained the Music Bureau, continuing it the same as it had been since ancient times.Birrell, 6 and note 15, p. 175 In any case, Wudi is widely held to have used the Music Bureau as an important part of his religious innovations and to have specifically commissioned Sima Xiangru to write poetry. The Music Bureau was officially disbanded by Emperor Ai of Han in the year 7 BCE, partly as an economy measure. By that time it had nearly 830 musicians and dancers. The Music Bureau was not revived for a long period. During the Tang Dynasty, the Music Bureau was responsible for composing the music for the Grand Carnival in Chang'an. Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty also temporarily established the Great Splendour Music Bureau (Dasheng Yuefu) that had 785 musicians and dancers in 1102. Influence on poetry Because of the development and transmission of a particular style of poetry by the Music Bureau, this style of poetry has become known as the \\"Music Bureau\\" style, or Yuefu. Several important collections survive of the Han dynasty Yuefu, including some in Xiao Tong and others' work Wen Xuan and some in Xu Ling's New Songs from the Jade Terrace; however the most importantBirrell, 8 collection is Guo Maoqian's Anthology of Yuefu Poetry, which includes the poem \\"Hua Mulan\\".

It is also a townland in the civil parish of Castlecomer in the ancient barony of Fassadinin. Clogh is situated on the R426 road near Castlecomer. History In 1837 it lay along the road from Castlecomer on the road to Athy. It containing 116 houses( mostly thatched) and 582 inhabitants. Most people were employed in the neighbouring collieries. It had a constabulary police station. In 1837, the district of Clogh comprised parts of the parishes of Castlecomer and Rathaspeck. The Roman Catholic chapel for the district was in Clogh. The village takes its name from the Irish An Chloc which means \\"stone\\" or \\"stone building\\". The original townsland name was Magleitid (Broad plain). History tells of a castle sited in the \\"Castle field\\" in the townland of Coultha; this may be where Clogh derived its name. The village is 27 km north of Kilkenny City, 16 km from Carlow town, 25 km from Portlaoise, and 20 km from Athy to the north. Clogh is in the Electoral Division of Clogh, in the civil parish of Castlecomer, in the Barony of Fassadinin, County of Kilkenny. Clogh borders the following townlands: Aughatubbrid or Chatsworth, Cloneen, Coolnaleen, Crutt, Kill, Loon, Moneenroe, Tourtane. The Electoral Division covers an area of 0.83 square miles with a population of 1,127. Demographic changes As of the 2006 census, by the Central Statistics Office, the town's population, including Chatsworth, was 351. This was a 9.7% change since 2002. As of the 2016 census, the population was 344. Clogh was once a densely populated rural area, mostly due to the employment given in the many coal mines around the area. Coalmining began in the 1640s by Christopher Wandesforde, the coal produced was a high grade anthracite with low sulphur content. Situated in the Leinster Coal ‚Äì fields which spread into counties Laois and Carlow, by the late 1800s seven or eight mines existed, and in Deerpark mines opened in the 1920s and at its peak employed 600 people, when the mines closed in 1969 it was a blow to the communities of North Kilkenny. The housing at that time is best described as of the bohawn type ‚Äì low thatched houses with little ventilation, only three survive to this day. Many coal-mining families emigrated to Heckscherville, Pennsylvania during and after the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì1851. The Payne brothers who ran the coal pits came to the area of North Kilkenny and Laois to get miners for their mines. They provided transportation, employment and homes to those who agreed to move. The graveyard at St.Kierans in Heckscherville have some of these families interred. Many of their descendants travel to Ireland to find information on their families. Built heritage The first church in Clogh was built on the site of the present church in the 13th century. This replaced the ancient church that stood at Kilpatrick. The present church was built in 1826. The graveyard is large and contains monuments, including one to Michael Fenlon who constructed the first Boulton & Watt steam engine for use in the nearby Doonane Colliery (1793/94). Fenlon was a lecturer in Trinity College, Dublin, he died at the young age of 36 years. Moneenroe Catholic Church was built in 1928 and cost twelve thousand pounds with the local miners contributing six thousand pounds. They also built the Moneenroe Hall, this has since been renovated at a cost of one hundred thousand euro. The Colliery Church was consecrated in 1829 and serves the Church of Ireland Community in the area.

Before the time of the Domesday Survey, Bramdean was included in the Meonstoke Hundred until it was transferred to the Finchdean Hundred. The land comprising the hundred was assessed in the reign of Edward the Confessor at 89 hides, and at the time of the survey at estimated to be about 56 hides. By the beginning of the fourteenth century the area of the hundred had much decreased. West Meon, Exton, Alverstoke, Abbots Worthy, Liss and a large part of the parish of Hambledon had been removed and transferred into the Odiham Hundred.

It is formed by the Pacific plate subducting under the Australian plate. The Tonga-Kermadec Ridge, a frontal arc, and the Lau- Colville Ridge, a remnant arc, sit to the eastern and western sides of the basin, respectively.Gill, J. B. 1976. \\"Composition and Age of Lau Basin and Ridge Volcanic Rocks: Implications for Evolution of an Interarc Basin and Remnant Arc.\\" Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 87 (10): 1384‚Äì1395. History Lau Basin is a young basin (<= 5 m.y. old) that separates a previously continuous island arc by extensional rifting. During the Pliocene, the Pacific plate was subducting beneath the Australian plate. The slab of the Pacific plate melted as it was thrust down, and then rose to form the original Tonga-Kermadec Ridge. Around 25 Ma B.P, the Pacific plate started to drift away from the Australian plate, thus splitting the volcanic ridge. The rifting was initially caused by extension until 6 Ma B.P, by which time seafloor spreading started in this region and eventually formed the Lau Basin between the separated ridges.  Spreading centers  Spreading centers and microplates of the Lau Basin The V-shaped Lau Basin was opened by two southward propagating spreading centers: the Central Lau Spreading Center (CLSC) and the East Lau Spreading Center (ELSC). The initial ELSC was oriented north-south and has a spreading rate of ~100mm/yr. The northeastern tip of ELSC propagated southward faster than the other part and produced a pseudofault oriented 170 degree. The ELSC rotated 15‚Äì25 degree clockwise and continued to propagate towards the south. Then the CLSC, as well as an extensional transform zone (ETZ) linking the two spreading centers were formed. The CLSC propagated southwards and replaced the northern segment ELSC. The region of overlap of CLSC and ELSC is characterized by strike-slip earthquakes. Recent measurements have shown that the opening rates are increasing at ELSC and CLSC. At present, the spreading rate of Lau Basin is about 150mm/year. It is an example of a fast-spreading back-arc basin.  Petrology  Lau Basin volcanics are mainly andesites and dacites that were erupted 6.4 to 9.0 Ma. Most mafic rocks found are 55% SiO2 basaltic andesites. The whole basin floor is mostly composed of MORB-like rocks, but the westmost 80~120 km of the basin floor contains a mixture of MORB, transitional and arc- like basalts. This western region has a different composition because it was formed by extension and rifting between the Lau and Tonga ridges before seafloor spreading started. The grabens in this region was then filled by fresh magma from a mantle source that is different from the mantle source for CLSC/ELSC.  Mantle source  The source of mantle melt to the Lau Basin is centered west of the spreading centers at shallow depth. This source may have directly supplied the western part of Lau Basin. The MORB-type basalt filled the grabens that were originally formed by extension in western Lau Basin. Asymmetric melt supply gave rise to the asymmetric thickness of crust at different sections of the basin. This melt supply may still be continuing today as indicated by a low-velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath the western Lau Basin.  Mantle convection  At the subduction boundary between Pacific plate and Tonga-Kermadec plate, the roll-back of the Tonga trench and Pacific slab caused compensating flow of the mantle beneath the Lau Basin. This fertile mantle then encounters the water released from the dehydrated subducting Pacific slab and undergoes partial melting. This results in the creation of a batch of depleted mantle between the fertile mantle and subducting slab. An upward flow of the depleted layer is then induced by back- arc spreading and slab subduction towards corner region where the mantle is hydrated. The enhanced melting in this region prevents the depleted mantle from getting re-enriched and thus allows it to flow until it overturns. It is then carried back down beneath the back-arc as subduction continues. The ELSC located right on top of the highly depleted mantle thus experiences a diminished magma supply which results in a thinner layer of crust and a faster spreading rate. The CLSC, on the other hand, has thicker crust because it overlies the fertile mantle that is largely removed from effect of the volcanic front. Unlike ELSC, CLSC has characteristics that are much more similar to a mid-ocean ridge.  Crustal structure  Crustal thickness increases from 6 km in the east to 9 km in the west. All of the Lau basin crust has a thicker midcrustal section than is seen in the pacific plate. The Lau Basin crust can be divided into eastern, central and western sections according to their thickness (5.5‚Äì6.5, 7.5‚Äì8.5 and 9 km, respectively). crust in the eastern section is similar to the one in the Pacific Plate with a thicker midcrustal layer and a thinner lower crustal layer. This suggests that it is composed of oceanic crust that was created more than 1.5Ma at the ELSC. The boundary between the eastern and central sections coincides with the boundary between the ELSC crust and CLSC crust, implying the internal structures in these two spreading ridges are, or were different. The central section has relatively thicker crust that formed within the past 1.5Ma at the CLSC. The boundary between the central and western crustal sections lies in the middle of ELSC crust, suggesting that the western section contains crust created both by oceanic spreading at ELSC and by island arc extension from the original Lau Basin.  Volcanoes and earthquakes  At present, the Lau Basin is still an active back-arc that is rapidly evolving in time. The next hydrocast is sure to reveal the next volcanic eruption or area of intense hydrothermal activity. 6 of the 7 volcanoes in the Lau Basin are still active. Earthquakes in this region are mostly crustal earthquakes. Small earthquakes from the basin are barely recorded on land because of high mantle attenuation. Most of the earthquakes, as well as volcanic activities locate at the east boundary of Lau Basin, along the Tonga Ridge which is very volcanically active.

Since the band's inception, they released two EPs independently before being signed to Mediaskare Records where the group released their debut album entitled America's Most Haunted on November 23, 2010. The band's second album, titled 1776, was released on July 16, 2013. History =Beginnings and first EPs (2001‚Äì2009)= Formed in 2001 by the Whited brothers; Adam and Chris, before being named King Conquer, they were once known as Dark Skies Have Fallen, a metalcore band that released one EP named Conquer in 2005. The band later changed their name to A Horror Story, and a few years later, to King Conquer, along with their genre to a much more death metal inspired sound. King Conquer started playing local shows near their hometown of Naples, Florida, establishing a strong fan-base. Vocalist Lafe Flynn recorded one EP with King Conquer, Welcome to Hell, before leaving the band. They then were out on search for a new frontman and held auditions throughout the Collier County area until discovering James Mislow. Mislow joining the band, the group then set out to record another EP wherein it was titled Decomposing Normality. The band at that period employed three guitarists. =America's Most Haunted (2010‚Äì2011)= King Conquer's debut full-length album, America's Most Haunted was released on November 23, 2010 after their signing to Mediaskare Records. The group then shortly thereafter began to make a name for themselves. In 2010, they began touring on the No Mercy Tour, with deathcore band Suffokate headlining, promoting their new album. The band toured again with Suffokate during November 2011 along with Blind Witness in the UK. =1776 (second album) (2011‚Äì2015)= King Conquer confirmed plans for their second full- length album during May 2011, which will be titled 1776, originally looking for a release date within 2012 through Mediaskare. However, the album required an extensive mastering procedure and was confirmed in November 2012 that it will instead be released in 2013. The band leaked a song off it titled \\"Tyranny\\" in its pre-production state during October 2011. The band headlined The Shredded to Pieces Tour. with bands including Abiotic (of Metal Blade Records), Forty Winters (of Dead Truth Recordings) and In Reference to a Sinking Ship (now known as Dark Sermon). This was a small week-long tour of Florida starting in Orlando on Sunday, April 15, 2012 and ending Sunday April 22 in Lake Worth at The Speakeasy Lounge. The band was included on the 2012 Devastation of the Nation Tour with Bermuda, The Last Ten Seconds of Life, In Dying Arms and other special guests. Bassist, Adam Whited, however was unable to be present on this tour due to King Conquer's touring van's air conditioning being currently broken and as a result, the summer heat was too extreme for him to withstand due to his struggles with multiple sclerosis. Whited's position in the band was substituted by 19-year-old Jesse Kirkbride (guitarist of Dealey Plaza) during this tour. Guitarist John Byrd departed from the band in April 2013 due to a conflict with the members which resulted in him being stranded in Texas. Byrd returned to the band, however, in August of the same year. In September, drummer Chris Whited and vocalist James Mislow both left for unknown reasons, they were replaced by Bryan Long of Dealey Plaza. King Conquer even acquired a third guitarist in the midst of these member replacements, Jesse Kirkbride, also of Dealey Plaza who previously substituted for the band on bass. The band reissued their EP Decomposing Normality in 2015 with new cover art after a fan held a crowdfunding campaign in order to have the EP reissued. The crowdfund raised over US$4,200. Following this, the EP was re-issued later that same year with new artwork and re-arranged track listing with two of the songs renamed (\\"Interlude\\" had its title changed to \\"Cataclysm\\" and \\"The Beginning\\" had its title changed to \\"The Immersive Design of Suffering\\"). Previous guitarist John Byrd was found dead on April 9, 2016. It was confirmed that he died due to complications concerning his ongoing substance abuse. On September 27, 2016 the band released a statement revealing that previous guitarist Brodie Wheeler had died from substance abuse issues.

It is found in the African continent, specifically in Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Pthirus gorillae and Pthirus pubis (the crab louse) are the only known species that belong to the genus Pthirus, often incorrectly spelled as Phthirus (the Greek word for louse is phthir). It is suggested that it is transmitted among its hosts by social grooming, shared bedding and sexual contact. All species of sucking lice feed on blood. They live in close association with their hosts and complete their entire life cycle on the host. Pthirus gorillae infests the same parts of the bodies of gorillas as Pthirus pubis does in humans, but since the gorilla is hairier, the lice tend to range over the whole body. The two also resemble each other with the exception that Pthirus gorillae has large eyes that are placed on large lateral protuberances. A short and broad sucking louse, it is about 2.20 mm long with sprawling legs and not more than 20 small abdominal setae. While morphologically these species are indistinguishable, they are clearly different in terms of behaviour, microhabitat preference and vector status. It was first identified from specimens of mountain gorillas in 1927 by Henry Ellsworth Ewing during a game hunting trip in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Molecular phylogenetics suggests that Pthirus gorillae jumped from gorillas to early humans 3.3 million years ago and diverged into the present-day pubic louse. Researchers theorize that humans acquired the parasite while butchering or scavenging on gorilla corpses, or sleeping in the abandoned sleeping nests of gorillas.

He was the first person to claim that Jesus Christ was born in or before 4 BC, not in AD 1, as the Christian era would imply. Suslyga was thus questioning the Anno Domini chronology introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 525.Duncan Steel, Marking Time p.324.A.J. Sachs, \\"Kepler's View of the Star of Bethlehem\\" Suslyga presented this theory in his 1605 doctoral thesis entitled Theoremata de anno ortus et mortis Domini, deque universa Jesu Christi in carne oeconomia at the University of Graz.Velificatio seu theoremata de anno ortus ac mortis domini, deque vniuersa Iesu Christi in carne oeconomia. 1605. Among other arguments, Suslyga's treatise included the following: Herod's son, Philip the Tetrarch, renamed a city (Bethsaida) after Augustus's biological daughter, Julia. Since she had been exiled from Rome by Augustus in 2 BC, Suslyga assumed that Philip must have renamed the city prior to that date, and Herod must have died prior to Philip's becoming a ruler, which pushes the Massacre of the Innocents at least 3, if not more, years before AD 1. Dionysius Exiguus' chronology did need to be questioned; his chronology did not even match the point of view of the early Christians. The Church Fathers generally believed that Jesus was born either in the 41st or 42nd year of the reign of Augustus (consulship, principate, etc.), that is in 3 or 2 BC.Finegan, Jack. Handbook of Biblical Chronology, Rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 291. Suslyga's work was used by Kepler to bolster the astronomer's theory that the Star of Bethlehem was perhaps a new star which may have appeared during or following the great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BC (later joined by Mars in 6 BC). In AD 1604, Kepler had witnessed the appearance of a nova in the region between the two planets during a similar Jupiter / Saturn great conjunction. He suggested that perhaps a new star, a miraculous \\"stella nova,\\" had possibly been associated with the conjunctions in 7/6 BC, as had happened in AD 1604.A.J. Sachs, \\"Kepler's View of the Star of Bethlehem\\" According to the biblical account, the wise men indicated that Christ's birth happened within a year or two of the appearance of the star. Kepler's scenario seemed to offer a logical explanation concerning the star of Bethlehem, while lending astronomical support to Suslyga's chronological ideas.W. Burke-Gaffney, \\"Kepler and the Star of Bethlehem\\"A.J. Sachs, \\"Kepler's View of the Star of Bethlehem\\" Suslyga's ideas about the renaming of Bethsaida have also been challenged. Frederick M. Strickert and others have pointed out that the identity of Augustus‚Äô daughter in Flavius Josephus' texts about the renaming of Bethsaida (Antiquities of the Jews 18.2.1, The Wars of the Jews 2.9.1) is not beyond dispute.Frederick M. Strickert, Philip‚Äôs City: From Bethsaida to Julias, (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical, 2011), pp. 163-188. It was assumed by Suslyga and many other scholars in recent centuries that Josephus was referring to Julia the Elder, the biological daughter of the emperor Augustus, concerning the renaming of Bethsaida as Julias. However, through his will, Augustus also officially adopted his wife Livia into the Julian family as his daughter, and gave her a new name, Julia.Strickert, Philip‚Äôs City, pp. 163-188. It is by her name Julia that Josephus always made reference to Livia, the emperor‚Äôs wife, even in his descriptions of events before Augustus‚Äô death and deification in AD 14. The Roman historian Velleius Paterculus (c. 19 BC - c. AD 31) confirms that Livia was known as Augustus‚Äô daughter: ‚ÄúTake for example Livia. She, the daughter of the brave and noble Drusus Claudianus, most eminent of Roman women in birth, in sincerity, and in beauty, she, whom we later saw as the wife of Augustus, and as his priestess and daughter after his deification.‚Äù Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.75.3 Many scholars now believe that Philip renamed Bethsaida as Julias in honor of Livia (Julia) following her death in AD 29. This would also explain why the name Julias persisted for generations. Otherwise the name would have probably disappeared not long after the disgrace of Julia the Elder. Pliny the Elder uses the name Julias for Bethsaida in about AD 77 and Claudius Ptolemy, the geographer, uses it in the second century AD.Pliny, Natural History 5.15.71Ptolemy, Geographia 5.16.4 Identifying Julias with Livia, instead of Julia the Elder, essentially renders invalid one of Suslyga‚Äôs main arguments for a 4 BC date of the death of Herod the Great.

Many months passed, the supreme god had compassion on the humans that had to live in the difficult period of their life, so he had two deities Khun Luang and Khun Lai climbed down a massive vine linking an island heaven that floated in the sky to the earth in order to drill the enormous gourd and take the surviving humans to a new land. The water levels had been come down already and there was the dry land. The deities helped the surviving people and led them to the new land. When everyone arrived in the land called Mueang Thaen, the two deities taught the humans how to cultivate rice, farming and building structures. =Taiwan's Saisiat Tribe= An old white-haired man came to Oppehnaboon in a dream and told him that a great storm would soon come. Oppehnaboon built a boat. Only Oppehnaboon and his sister survived. They had a child, they cut the child into pieces and each piece became a new person.

Life Ballantine was a native of Douglas, Lanarkshire, the parish of which his father was the minister. His paternal uncle was a lord of session, with the title of Lord Newhall. He studied at the University of Edinburgh, and later travelled on the continent. At Paris he was converted to the Catholic religion. He entered the Scotch College, Rome, where he took the oath on 1 November 1641, and for the next five years he studied philosophy and theology. In consequence of his delicate health, he was ordained a priest earlier than usual, on 3 December 1645. Having received the order of priesthood, he left the Scots College on 15 March 1646 and then stayed in the Scotch college at Paris, preparing himself for the mission. In 1649 Ballantine returned to Scotland. At this period the secular clergy of Scotland were in a state of disorganisation, and dissensions had arisen between them and the members of the religious orders, particularly the Jesuits. Ballantine despatched the Rev. William Leslie to Rome to ask for the appointment of a bishop for Scotland. This request was not granted by the Holy See, but in 1653, by a decree of propaganda, the Scotch secular clergy were freed from the jurisdiction of the English prelates and Jesuit superiorship; they were incorporated into a missionary body under the superintendence of Ballantine, who was declared the first Prefect-apostolic of the Mission in Scotland by the Propaganda Congregation on 13 October 1653. Among other conversions, he received Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly into the Catholic Church. In 1656 Ballantine visited France, and on his return, landing at Rye, Sussex, he was arrested by Oliver Cromwell's orders and taken to London, where he remained in confinement for nearly two years. He was then banished, and withdrew to Paris in poverty. In 1660 he returned to Scotland, and he spent the brief remainder of his life in the house of the Marchioness of Huntly at Elgin, where he died on 2 September 1661, aged 45.

Education He graduated from the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw in 1980. In that same year, he was employed at the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Warsaw. He received his Ph.D. in 1988 and then completed a two-year Postdoctoral Research Associate at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Contribution to astronomy He has authored or co-authored nearly 400 scientific papers. In 1996, he was honored by the Prime Minister for outstanding scientific achievements. In 2002, he won the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science (the so-called \\"Polish Nobel\\"). In 2009, he received a 2.5 million Euro grant from the program Ideas of the European Research Council that aims to support innovative research projects. In 2012, he became the recipient of the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. He was also awarded the prestigious Dan David Prize (2017), the Karl Schwarzschild Medal (2018) as well as the Tycho Brahe Prize (2018) for his contributions to astronomy. OGLE In April 1992, he launched the OGLE project, which aims at finding extrasolar planets using gravitational microlensing technique. Since then Udalski and his team made many important discoveries. Thanks to this project focusing on monitoring over a billion stars, he has discovered and characterized as many as a million variable stars of all types, expanding the knowledge by orders of magnitude. He was a pioneer of the use of gravitational microlensing which enabled him to exclude the presence of dark matter in the form of regular low-luminosity astrophysical bodies in the Milky Way halo. He was also one of the first ones to use the transit technique of extra-solar planet detection ‚Äì the first transiting planets came mostly from the OGLE survey. Among other significant discoveries of the OGLE project are the detection of the first merger of a binary star, first Cepheid pulsating stars in the eclipsing binary systems, unique Nova systems, large solar system dwarf planet candidates, many interesting quasars and galaxies. OGLE made many important contributions to the studies of the structure of the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies and calibration of the cosmic distance scale. In 1995-1996, he took part in the construction of the Warsaw Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. In 2001, he built a wide-angle mosaic CCD camera with more than 65 million light-sensitive elements.

It was a univallate hillfort (with a single rampart). The area is mostly farmland with some small areas of wooded copse to the south and the northeast.Ordnance Survey 2015. The hill fort may have been occupied from the 4th century BC to the 1st century BC,Pevsner 1966, 2002, p. 74. and replaced a small settlement surrounded by a stockade, which is estimated to have been built in the 5th or 6th century BC.English Heritage 2007. The hill demonstrates three principal phases, with the first consisting of a timber palisade surrounding a small settlement consisting of a few huts, dating to about 550 BC. This was later replaced in the 4th century BC by the first version of the hillfort, which covered twice the area as that included within the earlier palisade, with a single rampart and shallow ditch. After a period of abandonment, the hillfort was refortified around 100 BC, and the ditch was deepened. The fort was finally abandoned about 50 BC, with some evidence for a violent end to its occupation. During the early Anglo-Saxon period, the hilltop was used as a cemetery. The west side of the hill features a number of lynchets (terraces), the age and function of which are unknown, although they are believed to post-date the Iron Age. Location Blewburton Hill is situated between the villages of Aston Tirrold and Blewbury.Dyer 2001, p. 140. The site is within the parish of Aston Upthorpe in the district of South Oxfordshire. Its coordinates are .Historic England 2015. Description The hillfort encloses an area of approximately . There was an wide entrance on the west side of the fort, which may have possessed an overhead walkway. The gateway was protected by a ditch behind it, although this was later filled in. Unusually, a number of horse burials were found within the entrance. The gateway appears to have been set back within an approaching corridor between the rampart.Cunliffe 2004, p. 368. During the second phase of the fort, excavated postholes demonstrate that it possessed a double gate. The rampart was built a considerable time later than the original timber palisade that defended the early settlement.Cunliffe 2004, p. 349. The rampart was originally wide, with a gap between the inner and outer retaining timber supports.Cunliffe 2004, p. 351. The rampart was built from chalk packed firmly between the timber retainers.Avery 1986, pp. 216‚Äì217. The second phase of the rampart was of the \\"Low Dump\\" type, with an asymmetrical cross-section and a shallow incline towards the rear, with a much steeper front dropping directly into the ditch.Avery 1986, p. 217. This replaced the earlier filled-timber wall-and-fill style of rampart.Avery 1986, p. 218. In the eastern part of the hillfort, the rampart has been badly damaged by ploughing, and in places destroyed. In the western portion, part of the rampart survives as a sunken lynchet, and the ditch there survives as a flat terrace. In the first phase of the rampart, the ditch was approximately , but when it was recut for the second phase it was deepened to . The hill features a number of unusual terraces or lynchets, the age and function of which is unknown, although they are believed to post-date the Iron Age. History The hillfort appears to have been relatively intensely inhabited, compared to other hillforts in the region. The site was founded around 550 BC, and initially consisted of a small number of huts within a palisade that enclosed about half the area that would be included in the later fort. In the fourth century BC, the hilltop was enclosed with a bank quarried from its external ditch and held in place by timber retaining posts. The fort was abandoned for a time, but was refortified around 100 BC. The ditch was recut, and the spoil was piled upon the pre- existing bank. The entrance, formerly wide, was narrowed to and the flanking rampart ends were faced with dry-stone walling,Dyer 2001, p. 140. Pevsner 1966, 2002, p. 74. the stone for which must have been imported from elsewhere.Avery 1986, p. 220. Around 50 BC the hillfort was finally abandoned, perhaps due to expansion of the Belgae. The excavators uncovered evidence for a violent end to the occupation of the fort, with collapsed ramparts, signs of burning, and dead animals left where they lay. Centuries later, the Anglo- Saxons used the interior of the fort as a cemetery. The cemetery was dated to the early Anglo-Saxon period, and 22 buried individuals were excavated, and one cremation. Most of the remains were accompanied by grave goods. Finds In the western portion, a part of the original rampart and ditch survive as a sunken lynchet. Neolithic or Early Bronze Age flints were recovered during excavations, and a polished stone axe was recovered from the ditch near the entrance. Although there was no Roman occupation of the hilltop, a number of fragments of Roman pottery were recovered, dating to the 1st century AD, and the 3rd‚Äì4th centuries AD. In one Iron Age burial pit, the remains of a horse and a dog were found buried together with the remains of a man.Green 1998, p. 112. Other Iron Age finds include an iron currency bar, ceramics, two shale pendents and some fragments of shale bracelets. Grave goods associated with the Anglo-Saxon cemetery included amber and glass beads, a spearhead, two bronze brooches, buckles, knives, and some pots. Investigation Archaeological excavations were undertaken at the site between 1947 and 1953, with further investigation in 1967. The 1967 excavation was carried out by D. W. Harding, who investigated the ditch and rampart on the north side of the fort. Notes References :Avery, Michael.

The 13-week training duration consisted of three terms and vacations over a three- to four-year duration. Tuition and fees The fee ranged from 90 to 100 guineas a year. Colonian scholarships During an address in 1886 to the students of the Oxford Military College, Lord Wolseley expressed regret that there were no students from the Colonies since youth from the Colonies would well together the empire.Hawera & Normanby Star, Volume VIII, Issue 1399, 14 August 1886. Six colonial scholarships were offered subsequently annually, two scholarships in each of the principal colonies. The scholarships of ¬£50 and ¬£25 were awarded for three years depending on residency and satisfactory conduct. To qualify for entry via scholarship, the headmaster of the College set a paper, which was decided by the examiners for general proficiency or excellence in one or more subjects. The scholarships were awarded to boys of good character between 14‚Äì16 years of age, whose parents or guardians lived in the Colonies.Oxford Military College Colonial scholarships, Australia. Owners who held over 20 shares of the college could nominate a student at a lower rate than others.

They threatened to kill every \\"black republican\\" they chanced to meet. The Copperhead Murderers Mason seems to have led the Mason Henry Gang into outright criminality, three murders committed on November 10, 1864, soon after the second election of Abraham Lincoln. Following the voting, during a party held at the Elkhorn Station and settlement, George Robinson who ran the stage station, a strong Union supporter from Maine, had gotten drunk and had made certain remarks slurring all Southern women.

In April 1865, word arrived at San Juan that the Mason Henry Gang had attacked at Firebaugh's Ferry. Captain Jimeno, in command of Camp Low, sent Lieutenant John Lafferty and a detachment of five Californio lancers from Company B, 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers, in pursuit of the bandits. Hoping to cut off the gang at Panoche Pass, the lancers rode south along the western flank of the Diablo Range and encountered Mason the next morning. As the bandit spurred his horse in a desperate attempt to escape, Lafferty fired, wounding Mason in the hip and felling his mount with a single bullet. Although the soldiers captured the outlaw's horse, somehow Mason managed to elude them. At six that evening, Lafferty and his troopers returned to Camp Low with only the horse in tow. see note 23, Alta California, April 12, 13, 1865. Gang breaks up, Death of Mason When the Civil War ended in April with Lee's surrender at Appomattox and no longer shielded by \\"the cause\\", the gang came under pressure in Central California. They moved into Southern California and split up. John Mason continued his criminal career in Los Angeles County in the vicinity of Fort Tejon and in what is now Kern County with a $500 reward on his head. While Ben Mayfield was riding to Fort Tejon from his mine in Lytle Creek in April 1866, Mason joined him on the ride and later tried to recruit him into his gang. When Ben Mayfield refused, Mason threatened to kill him, and also threatened to take the horse of another man, W. H. Overton, and kill him. That night while the three were in the same house, none went to sleep but in the early morning Mason lay down on his bed under a blanket, but was awake. Overton stepped out to look after his horse, then Mason tried to shoot Mayfield from his bed. Mason's pistol tangled in his blanket, giving Mayfeild the chance to shoot him first.

In crystallography, a periodic graph or crystal net is a three-dimensional periodic graph, i.e., a three-dimensional Euclidean graph whose vertices or nodes are points in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and whose edges (or bonds or spacers) are line segments connecting pairs of vertices, periodic in three linearly independent axial directions. There is usually an implicit assumption that the set of vertices are uniformly discrete, i.e., that there is a fixed minimum distance between any two vertices. The vertices may represent positions of atoms or complexes or clusters of atoms such as single-metal ions, molecular building blocks, or secondary building units, while each edge represents a chemical bond or a polymeric ligand. Although the notion of a periodic graph or crystal net is ultimately mathematical (actually a crystal net is nothing but a periodic realization of an abelian covering graph over a finite graph ), and is closely related to that of a Tessellation of space (or honeycomb) in the theory of polytopes and similar areas, much of the contemporary effort in the area is motivated by crystal engineering and prediction (design), including metal- organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites. History A crystal net is an infinite molecular model of a crystal. Similar models existed in Antiquity, notably the atomic theory associated with Democritus, which was criticized by Aristotle because such a theory entails a vacuum, which Aristotle believed nature abhors. Modern atomic theory traces back to Johannes Kepler and his work on geometric packing problems. Until the twentieth century, graph-like models of crystals focused on the positions of the (atomic) components, and these pre-20th century models were the focus of two controversies in chemistry and materials science. The two controversies were (1) the controversy over Robert Boyle‚Äôs corpuscular theory of matter, which held that all material substances were composed of particles, and (2) the controversy over whether crystals were minerals or some kind of vegetative phenomenon. During the eighteenth century, Kepler, Nicolas Steno, Ren√© Just Ha√ºy, and others gradually associated the packing of Boyle-type corpuscular units into arrays with the apparent emergence of polyhedral structures resembling crystals as a result. During the nineteenth century, there was considerably more work done on polyhedra and also of crystal structure, notably in the derivation of the Crystallographic groups based on the assumption that a crystal could be regarded as a regular array of unit cells. During the early twentieth century, the physics and chemistry community largely accepted Boyle's corpuscular theory of matter‚Äîby now called the atomic theory‚Äîand X-ray crystallography was used to determine the position of the atomic or molecular components within the unit cells (by the early twentieth century, unit cells were regarded as physically meaningful). However, despite the growing use of stick-and-ball molecular models, the use of graphical edges or line segments to represent chemical bonds in specific crystals have become popular more recently, and the publication of see encouraged efforts to determine graphical structures of known crystals, to generate crystal nets of as yet unknown crystals, and to synthesize crystals of these novel crystal nets. The coincident expansion of interest in tilings and tessellations, especially those modeling quasicrystals, and the development of modern Nanotechnology, all facilitated by the dramatic increase in computational power, enabled the development of algorithms from computational geometry for the construction and analysis of crystal nets. Meanwhile, the ancient association between models of crystals and tessellations has expanded with Algebraic topology. There is also a thread of interest in the very-large-scale integration (VLSI) community for using these crystal nets as circuit designs. Basic formulation A Euclidean graph in three-dimensional space is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of points (sometimes called vertices or nodes) and E is a set of edges (sometimes called bonds or spacers) where each edge joins two vertices. There is a tendency in the polyhedral and chemical literature to refer to geometric graphs as nets (contrast with polyhedral nets), and the nomenclature in the chemical literature differs from that of graph theory. =Symmetries and periodicity= A symmetry of a Euclidean graph is an isometry of the underlying Euclidean space whose restriction to the graph is an automorphism; the symmetry group of the Euclidean graph is the group of its symmetries. A Euclidean graph in three-dimensional Euclidean space is periodic if there exist three linearly independent translations whose restrictions to the net are symmetries of the net. Often (and always, if one is dealing with a crystal net), the periodic net has finitely many orbits, and is thus uniformly discrete in that there exists a minimum distance between any two vertices. The result is a three- dimensional periodic graph as a geometric object. The resulting crystal net will induce a lattice of vectors so that given three vectors that generate the lattice, those three vectors will bound a unit cell, i.e., a parallelopiped which, placed anywhere in space, will enclose a fragment of the net that repeats in the directions of the three axes. =Symmetry and kinds of vertices and edges= Two vertices (or edges) of a periodic graph are symmetric if they are in the same orbit of the symmetry group of the graph; in other words, two vertices (or edges) are symmetric if there is a symmetry of the net that moves one onto the other. In chemistry, there is a tendency to refer to orbits of vertices or edges as ‚Äúkinds‚Äù of vertices or edges, with the recognition that from any two vertices or any two edges (similarly oriented) of the same orbit, the geometric graph ‚Äúlooks the same‚Äù. Finite colorings of vertices and edges (where symmetries are to preserve colorings) may be employed. The symmetry group of a crystal net will be a (group of restrictions of a) crystallographic space group, and many of the most common crystals are of very high symmetry, i.e., very few orbits. A crystal net is uninodal if it has one orbit of vertex (if the vertices were colored and the symmetries preserve colorings, this would require that a corresponding crystal have atoms of one element or molecular building blocks of one compound ‚Äì but not vice versa, for it is possible to have a crystal of one element but with several orbits of vertices). Crystals with uninodal crystal nets include cubic diamond and some representations of quartz crystals. Uninodality corresponds with isogonality in geometry and vertex-transitivity in graph theory, and produces examples objective structures. A crystal net is binodal if it has two orbits of vertex; crystals with binodal crystal nets include boracite and anatase. It is edge- transitive or isotoxal if it has one orbit of edges; crystals with edge- transitive crystal nets include boracite but not anatase ‚Äì which has two orbits of edges. =Geometry of crystal nets= In the geometry of crystal nets, one can treat edges as line segments. For example, in a crystal net, it is presumed that edges do not ‚Äúcollide‚Äù in the sense that when treating them as line segments, they do not intersect. Several polyhedral constructions can be derived from crystal nets. For example, a vertex figure can be obtained by subdividing each edge (treated as a line segment) by the insertion of subdividing points, and then the vertex figure of a given vertex is the convex hull of the adjacent subdividing points (i.e., the convex polyhedron whose vertices are the adjacent subdividing points). Another polyhedral construction is to determine the neighborhood of a vertex in the crystal net. One application is to define an energy function as a (possibly weighted) sum of squares of distances from vertices to their neighbors, and with respect to this energy function, the net is in equilibrium (with respect to this energy function) if each vertex is positioned at the centroid of its neighborhood, this is the basis of the crystal net identification program SYSTRE. (mathematicians use the term \`\`harmonic realiaztions\\" instead of \`\`crystal nets in equilibrium positions\\" because the positions are characterized by the discrete Laplace equation; they also introduced the notion of standard realizations which are special harmonic realizations characterized by a certain minimal principle as well;see ). Some crystal nets are isomorphic to crystal nets in equilibrium positions, and since an equilibrium position is a normal form, the crystal net isomorphism problem (i.e., the query whether two given crystal nets are isomorphic as graphs; not to be confused with crystal isomorphism) is readily computed even though, as a subsumption of the graph isomorphism problem, it is apparently computationally difficult in general. Active areas of crystal design using crystal nets It is conjectured that crystal nets may minimize entropy in the following sense. Suppose one is given an ensemble of uniformly discrete Euclidean graphs that fill space, with vertices representing atoms or molecular building blocks and with edges representing bonds or ligands, extending through all space to represent a solid. For some restrictions, there may be a unique Euclidean graph that minimizes a reasonably defined energy function, and the conjecture is that that Euclidean graph may necessarily be periodic. This question is still open, but some researchers observe crystal nets of high symmetry tending to predominate observed Euclidean graphs derived from some classes of materials. Historically, crystals were developed by experimentation, currently formalized as combinatorial chemistry, but one contemporary desideratum is the synthesis of materials designed in advance, and one proposal is to design crystals (the designs being crystal nets, perhaps represented as one unit cell of a crystal net) and then synthesize them from the design. This effort, in what Omar Yaghi described as reticular chemistry is proceeding on several fronts, from the theoretical to synthesizing highly porous crystals. One of the primary issues in annealing crystals is controlling the constituents, which can be difficult if the constituents are individual atoms, e.g., in zeolites, which are typically porous crystals primarily of silicon and oxygen and occasional impurities. Synthesis of a specific zeolite de novo from a novel crystal net design remains one of the major goals of contemporary research. There are similar efforts in sulfides and phosphates. Control is more tractable if the constituents are molecular building blocks, i.e., stable molecules that can be readily induced to assemble in accordance with geometric restrictions. Typically, while there may be many species of constituents, there are two main classes: somewhat compact and often polyhedral secondary building units (SBUs), and linking or bridging building units. A popular class of examples are the Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), in which (classically) the secondary building units are metal ions or clusters of ions and the linking building units are organic ligands. These SBUs and ligands are relatively controllable, and some new crystals have been synthesized using designs of novel nets. An organic variant are the Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), in which the SBUs might (but not necessarily) be themselves organic. The greater control over the SBUs and ligands can be seen in the fact that while no novel zeolites have been synthesized per design, several MOFs have been synthesized from crystal nets designed for zeolite synthesis, such as Zeolite-like Metal-Organic Frameworks (Z-MOFs) and zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIFs).

Unrest and looting was reported in seven provincial capitals of the country due to the lack of law enforcement. President Rafael Correa went to the police headquarters in Quito despite recommendations from his own security personnel not to attend and make things worse. He was ill-received, making a harsh speech in which he accused the police ranks of treason to the people and the country, and dared them to kill him. After he was pelted by the police ranks and a tear gas canister went off, Correa was escorted to a hospital in the same compound. According to El Pa√≠s, The New York Times, El Correo and Correa himself, the policemen then surrounded the building and prevented him from leaving. From the hospital, Correa declared a state of emergency and said that a \\"coup d'√©tat was taking place\\", and attributed responsibility to the government's opposition. According to state news agency ANDES, police radio recordings from the night of 30 September revealed that the police intended to kill Correa. Thousands of civilians came out to support Correa and gathered around the hospital in which he was held hostage. Agencia P√∫blica de Noticias del Ecuador y Suram√©rica (ANDES), 4 October 2010, (EXCLUSIVO) Registro de comunicaciones de la Central de Radio Patrulla deja en evidencia intenci√≥n de asesinar al Presidente Correa Clashes occurred between rebellious police forces and loyal army and police forces, who successfully rescued Correa after he had allegedly been held for 10 hours at the hospital. Ecuador's Health Minister said the events had left eight dead and 274 people wounded. Of the casualties, it is known that one was a university student, and that a police officer and two military personnel involved in the rescue operation were also among those killed. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, Jos√© Miguel Insulza referred to the events as an attempted coup d'√©tat. Background Ecuador's recent history has been characterized by institutional instability. Between 1997 and 2007, Ecuador has had eight presidents, and two of them had been overthrown in political unrest: Jamil Mahuad in 2000 and Lucio Guti√©rrez in 2005. Since then, Correa's PAIS alliance has won five consecutive elections, including two Presidential elections (2006 and 2009), a referendum to modify the Constitution and a referendum to approve the new Constitution. A poll published on 15 September 2010 showed Correa had a 67% approval rating in Quito and 59% in Guayaquil. =Public Service Organic Law= The Public Service Organic Law was drafted by the executive, and was perceived by the armed forces and law enforcement as introducing cuts to their benefits. Such cuts included: the removal of Christmas bonuses, bonuses accompanying the awarding of medals, as well as service awards based on time in service. The draft generated much controversy during parliamentary debates. However, it passed through first, second and plenary rounds of parliamentary votes in the National Assembly. On 3 September, President Correa made a partial objection to the law proposal. According to an Ecuavisa report, government sources indicated that Correa considered dissolving parliament and calling for new elections due to disagreements within his own party with respect to his concerns over the new legislation. As of 30 September, after fifteen months of debate, the law proposal had not yet been finalised by the Assembly. It was argued by some that the police were ill-informed of the new measures, which were not meant to cut benefits; rather the benefits were intended to be provided by other means. As the events developed officials, and the Latin America media, as well as Correa supporters, expressed concern that they could follow the same course as the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat in which another left-leaning Latin American president, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown by the military during a constitutional crisis.Ecuador in turmoil amid 'coup attempt' ‚Äì AFP/Yahoo News, 30 September 2010. \\"The unrest, which recalled a coup which overthrew the elected president in Honduras last year\\" (Correa is known as, and describes himself as, \\"left-wing\\".) The ruling government in Honduras sent a message of support for Correa after news of the crisis in Ecuador broke. Attack on the president \\"If you want to kill the president, here he is. Kill me, if you want to. Kill me if you are brave enough!\\"\\", President Rafael Correa shouted at the policemen. On the morning of 30 September, members of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces and National Police occupied several barracks and set up road blocks in nine of the country's provincial capitals to demand that special bonuses paid to the police and military. These police and armed forces occupied the National Assembly building. The Ecuadorian Air Force shut down Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito and Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, forcing their closure for several hours. Police also blocked roads in Guayaquil, the largest city of Ecuador, and reported unrest in 2 other cities. Looters also ransacked banks, supermarkets and shopping malls in the port city of Guayaquil. President Correa went to the police barracks in Quito where he arrived at 11:00 A.M. (GMT+5); after being ill-received ‚Äì an honor guard was not assembled ‚Äì he first tried to have a dialogue with the police and criticized their actions as treason to \\"the people and the country\\", but after hearing hostile police chant \\"Lucio presidente, Lucio presidente\\" he screamed \\"'If you want to kill the president, here he is. Kill me, if you want to. Kill me if you are brave enough!\\" After Correa had left the barracks, he was attacked by the police with a tear gas canister that almost hit Correa's head. Demonstrators tried to kick his knee that had recently been operated on. Correa was walking with a cane because of the operation. Correa was escorted to a hospital in the same compound. Police forces outside the hospital building surrounded it and kept him from leaving; a helicopter tried to evacuate him and his entourage but was prevented from landing by obstacles in the landing pad. They also arrested one member of his close protection team. La Hora Nacional however reported that two hospital employees denied it was a hostage situation, El Pa√≠s reported recorded dialogues between the policemen, in which they announce their intentions to kill him or put him out of office. From the hospital, Correa declared a state of emergency, after he accused the opposition and security forces of an attempted coup and orchestrating the protests. He stated that he was declaring a five-day state of emergency in an attempt to restore order. Reports indicated the armed forces remained loyal to the constitutional order.Al Jazeera English News Update. 1 October 2010, 3:00. Correa said that a rescue operation had been ready for a few hours, but was postponed so as to avoid more bloodshed. Correa's supporters, as well, urged by the country's foreign minister to rescue \\"their president,\\" were stopped from meeting the president, and clashed with the police around Quito. They reportedly chanted \\"This is not Honduras,\\" in reference to the 2009 coup in that country. Hundreds of Correa supporters gathered outside the National Assembly, which was seized by striking police, while Interior Minister Gustavo Jahlk met with representatives of the rebellious police. By afternoon, protesters took control of the channels. Many attacks on journalists and photojournalists by rebellious police, have been denounced in Quito and other cities. Workers and equipment of Ecuador TV, Radio P√∫blica, Ecuavisa, Teleamazonas, and El Comercio, were object of aggression, several ecuatorian journalists being wounded. International journalists, from AFP and teleSUR have also been attacked. =Rescue operation= In the late hours of the evening, three teams of special police and army teams (GIR, GOE and army paratroopers) and elite army troops part of a force of around 500 uniformed personnel loyal to their allegiance rescued him after clashes with rebellious police forces inside and outside the hospital building. The rescue from the hospital, was shown live on Ecuadorean television. Bullets hit his room during the rescue operation. Venezuelan-American lawyer Eva Golinger stated that investigators \\"concluded [that] coup forces were attempting to assassinate him before he could be rescued.\\" As Correa was rescued, his armoured car was hit by four bullets but the investigation shows that the car, a Nissan Patrol, that had been used to rescue the president didn't have any impacts, and it is still unclear where was the black armoured vehicle (Ford) when it was hit. Correa was then taken to the Presidential Palace, where he gave a \\"fiery speech\\" to the public thanking those who supported him and came to Quito to support the \\"citizen's revolution and democracy in our country\\" and the members of the government who risked their lives in support of him. He also thanked UNASUR and the other Latin American countries that supported him. He criticized those who attempted the coup saying: \\"How could they call themselves police after acting like this against the people?\\", and said there would not be any immunity for the perpetrators nor would there be any \\"negotiation under duress\\". He called the attackers \\"cowards\\" and claimed to have spoken to officers who were holding him hostage at the hospital and asked them two questions: Have you ever been paid this well? and have you read the law? He claimed they said they had never been better treated than through his administration and that they had not read the controversial law. When the protesters asked him to revoke the law, he answered that he did not have the power to do so and that he would leave as president or as a corpse, and in the end he left with his \\"head held high\\". Alleged perpetrators President Correa said that \\"the uprising was incited for political motives\\" and accused former President Lucio Guti√©rrez and other opposition politicians for \\"attempting to instigate a coup\\". He said that there were infiltrates from \\"well-known political parties\\" among the rebellious police. Police were also heard chanting \\"Lucio Guti√©rrez president\\" while Correa spoke to them. Guti√©rrez' former lawyer was reported to have been spotted amongst a crowd of officers that stormed the building of the state television ECTV and cut off the transmission. Lucio Guti√©rrez, a former president ousted by a popular uprising and leader of the opposition Sociedad Patri√≥tica Party, who had participated in the coup d'√©tat against Jamil Mahuad said that the only responsible for the situation was Correa himself and his \\"abusive, corrupt and prepotent government\\". He accused President Correa of trying to divert the attention from corruption scandals affecting his government. Guti√©rrez said \\"Is true that we want to take Correa out, but with votes, and he shall finish his term so we can defeat him in free election (...) non-fraudulent\\". During the incident Guti√©rrez suggested the dissolution of the National Assembly as a \\"solution to avoid the possibility of bloodshed in the country\\",The National Assembly replaced the National Congress in 2009, under the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador. coinciding with the actions of the police who had taken occupation of the assembly building. Journalist Jean-Guy Allard claimed, on Radio Del Sur, that the \\"coup attempt confirmed\\" a 2008 report by Defence Minister Javier Ponce on infiltration of the Ecuadorian police by United States intelligence agents, including funding of police equipment and operations, and payment of informers. (archival copy has css problem: change style or select text to read) In response to the 2008 report, US ambassador Heather Hodges stated that the US \\"works with\\" the Ecuadorian military and police \\"on objectives that are very important for security\\", including the \\"fight against drug trafficking.\\" Allard also referred to former CIA agent Philip Agee's description of US involvement with the Ecuadorian police in the early 1960s. He cited his suspicion about the visit of several United States officials to Ecuador, officially \\"to deepen relations,\\" during the months prior to the coup attempt was a \\"pretext.\\" Pepe Escobar of Asia Times also alleged that \\"everyone in South America\\" knows of US involvement, as he cited similar reaction to the Honduran coup.Latin America Rising. RT. Russia Today alleged a link between the School of the Americas and the attempted coup.CIA behind failed Ecuador coup? . Russia Today. Venezuelan-American lawyer Eva Golinger claimed that the coup attempt was part of a systematic, US-supported plan to destabilise member states of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA).Pachakutik supported Guti√©rrez as presidential candidate in 2002; a few months after his presidency started, however, the relationship broke up. She alleged that US ambassador Heather Hodges was sent to Ecuador by former US President George W. Bush \\"with the intention of sowing destabilization against Correa, in case the Ecuadoran president refused to subordinate himself to Washington's agenda,\\" and that Hodges increased the budget of USAID and the NED for social and political groups that \\"promote US interests.\\" Golinger claimed that certain \\"progressive\\" social groups received \\"financing and guidelines in order to provoke destabilising situations in the country that go beyond the natural expressions of criticism and opposition to a government.\\" According to Golinger, USAID's 2010 budget in Ecuador $38 million. Golinger referred to the indigenous political party Pachakutik Movement's press release on 30 September asking for Correa's resignation on the grounds that his \\"dictatorial attitude\\" had generated \\"serious political turmoil and internal crisis.\\" In the statement, Pachakutik leader Cl√©ver Jim√©nez said that the \\"situation\\" of the police and armed forces in the coup attempt \\"should be understood as a just action by public servants, whose rights have been made vulnerable.\\" Golinger alleged that Pachakutik was funded by NED and USAID and that its call for Correa's resignation and its support for the mutiny was an example of the US plans to destabilise ALBA member states. Pachakutik strongly denied having \\"any relationship at all with the organism known as USAID, previously NED, not today nor ever\\" and accused the Ecuadorian government of having accepted USAID/NED funding. Golinger responded by referring to a National Democratic Institute (NDI, one of the four institutes funded by NED) report from 2007 describing Pachakutik being trained by the NDI in \\"Triangle of Party Best Practices and strategic planning methodologies\\" as part of NDI's Latin American/Caribbean Political Party Network of over 1400 individual members, funded under NED Core Grants 2000-031, 2001‚Äì048, 2003‚Äì028, and 2004-036. The United States government denied any involvement and deemed the accusations as unsubstantiated. The United States had already declared support for Correa through its ambassador to the Organization of American States. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also expressed \\"full support for President Rafael Correa, and the institutions of democratic government in that country.\\" On 5 October, Ecuadorian foreign minister Ricardo Pati√±o said \\"I firmly believe that Mr. Obama had nothing to do with this. I hope, I trust that his main authorities also didn't\\". Relations between the Ecuadorian and United States governments regarding the Ecuadorian police forces had been strained since 2009 when the Ecuadorian government was unhappy about United States involvement in the appointment of Ecuadorian police officials. =Investigations= On 1 October, Coronel Ces√°r Carrion, Quito's metropolitan police chief; Marcelo Echeverr√≠a, the provincial police commander; and Manuel E. Rivadeneira Tello, the head of the barracks where Correa was attacked, were detained. They were released the next day but barred from leaving Ecuador pending an investigation for \\"negligence, rebellion and attempted assassination,\\" according to prosecutor Gonzalo Marco Freire. Manuel E. Rivadeneira Tello, was alleged by Allard to have trained at the School of the Americas (SOA). The School of the Americas Watch lists Rivadeneira as having trained at the SOA from 25 February to 18 April 1980, in the C-8 armed combat cadet group. On 5 October, Fidel Araujo, close collaborator of Lucio Guti√©rrez, was detained for investigations about his role in the uprising, as TV has shown him among the rebellious police in Quito, in the early hours of the strike. Also, recorded dialogues between the policemen that surrounded the hospital where Rafael Correa was kept, were undisclosed. In them, the policemen announce their intentions to kill the President, or have him out of office. Interior Minister Gustavo Jalkh announced the arrest of 46 police officers for alleged participation in the revolt. He claimed prosecutors had voice recordings that implicate them. Correa also warned that there was still an ongoing conspiracy within the police ranks that could pose a threat as he called for firm punishment against accused. Aftermath After the day's events, four people were confirmed dead, one of whom was a university student, and the others were a police officer and two military personnel involved in the rescue operation. One-hundred and ninety-three were injured, 24 of them seriously. Forty of them were personnel of the armed forces. Reports indicated the police were back to work the next day and Guayaquil was back to normal. The chief of police, Freddy Martinez, took responsibility, and resigned following the attacks saying \\"A commander shown such lack of respect by his subordinates cannot stay in charge.\\" The government said it would not purge the police force, but were looking for those responsible who would \\"not be pardoned.\\" Patricio Franco, the newly appointed police chief, asked the public to \\"trust the police,\\" saying the revolt was led by a group of \\"foolish and crazy people who acted violently\\". He also stressed the role of \\"infiltrates\\". On 1 October, Correa issued a three-day national mourning period for the dead, but did not revoke the five-day state of emergency as the country gradually returned to normality. Foreign minister Ricardo Pati√±o, warned that the situation might not be over yet. \\"We cannot claim total victory. We have overcome the situation for now, but we cannot relax. The coup attempt may have roots out there, we have to find them and pull them up.\\" Correa told UNASUR foreign ministers that \\"they wanted to provoke a civil war.\\" The media also speculated that the crisis could mean a popularity boost for Correa, who had lost some support in recent months. It also cited Correa's mixed relationship with the armed forces since taking office, and this crisis could force a more \\"delicate line\\" working with the military. Previously he won over military chiefs using increases in salary hikes and appointments to what were considered \\"cushy state jobs.\\" If the police protests blow over, Correa will likely be forced to negotiate to keep the ranks calm. However, the international media also cited Correa's popularatiy among the poor for his spending oil largesse on welfare programmes and a firm stance against foreign investors. He may now be forced to boost public spending and seek alternative sources of credit after Ecuador's 2008 default on about $3 billion in debt. Additionally, foreign oil companies in Ecuador have until November to sign new contracts that would boost state control on the oil industry. On 2 October, Correa's government and his parliamentary block announced an agreement to modify some aspects of the Public Service Organic Law, that worried the police and the Armed Forces. On 5 October, the government decreed a salary increase for the police and the armed forces. Defence Minister Javier Ponce said that the adjustment was programmed since before the crisis. The Emergency rule was extended into the week following the raid, to allow the transfer of protection of the National Assembly. to the military. Reactions =Domestic= Citizens supporting Correa amassed in front of their provincial governments in a show of support. On 30 September, the opposition Pachakutik Movement published a press release asking for Correa to resign or be dismissed by the National Assembly under Article 130, Number 2 of the 2008 Constitution, on the grounds that his \\"dictatorial attitude\\" had generated \\"serious political turmoil and internal crisis.\\" Pachakutik leader Cl√©ver Jim√©nez said that he \\"backed the struggle of the country's public servants, including the police troops who have mobilized against the regime's authoritarian policies which are an attempt to eliminate acquired labor rights. The situation of the police and members of the Armed Forces should be understood as a just action by public servants, whose rights have been made vulnerable.\\" On 6 October, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and Pachakutik together issued a declaration stating \\"there never was any attempted coup d'etat, much less a kidnapping, but an event that responded to the uncertain political management of the government that causes popular discontent through permanent aggression, discrimination and violations of human rights consecrated in the Constitution.\\" CONAIE and Pachakutik demanded \\"the constitutional suspension of the National Congress for its failure to comply with the constitutional mandate that it legislate much less audit as it is well known that all laws are approved by the president's legal minister.\\" They \\"condemned the usurpation of press freedom when on September 30 all media not allied with the government was forced to broadcast government news in 'cadena nacional,' a means by which all access to information is controlled and manipulated with a version of the facts that does not inform about the real dimensions of the situation on that day in the country.\\" =Supranational bodies= Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon expressed concern. The Organization of American States Permanent Council unanimously approved by acclamation a resolution supporting Correa's government and asked all the stakeholders to avoid \\"exacerbating\\" the political instability. Ecuadorian ambassador Mar√≠a Isabel Salvador said that the events \\"cannot, in any way, be considered as simple union acts or public protests.\\" She also said Correa was in touch with his ministers. The European Union's Foreign Policy chief called for law and order to be respected. ;UNASUR UNASUR Member States presidents and representatives at the Buenos Aires emergency summit. Juan Manuel Santos (Colombia) and Hugo Ch√°vez (Venezuela) were in flight to Buenos Aires, and arrived hours later. The Secretary General of UNASUR, N√©stor Kirchner, said \\"South America cannot tolerate that corporative interests threaten and put pressure on democratically elected governments for fear of losing undue privileges\\". An emergency summit was held on the same night of the events, 30 September, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, attended by UNASUR member state Presidents Evo Morales, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, Jos√© Mujica, Juan Manuel Santos, Hugo Ch√°vez, Alan Garc√≠a, and host (in the absence of the President Pro-Tempore Correa) Cristina Kirchner, along with representatives of Brazil, Paraguay, Guyana and Suriname. There were two notable absentees: Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva did not attend because of the impending Brazilian general elections; and Fernando Lugo was absent because he was undertaking chemotherapy. A statementThe Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, reunited in the San Mart√≠n Palace, in the city of Buenos Aires, Republic of Argentina, on 1 October 2010, 1\\\\. Reaffirm their strong commitment to the preservation of democratic institutionality, the rule of law, constitutional order, social peace and unwavering respect for human rights, essential conditions in the process of regional integration. 2\\\\. Strongly condemn the attempted coup and the subsequent kidnapping of President Rafael Correa Delgado in the sister Republic of Ecuador, on 30 September. 3\\\\. Celebrate the liberation of President Correa Delgado, and the prompt return to democratic institutional normality in the sister republic, expressing the need for the trial and conviction of those responsible for the events. In this context, they reiterate their fullest support for the constitutional government and highlight the role played by the institutions for the restoration of the constitutional order. 4\\\\. Affirm that their respective governments strongly reject and will not tolerate ‚Äì in any way ‚Äì any further defiance to the institutional authority, nor any attempt at a coup against the legitimately-elected civil power. They warn that in the case of a break with constitutional order, they will adopt immediate and concrete steps, such as the closure of borders, suspension of commerce, air traffic, and energy, services, and other supplies. 5\\\\. Decide that their foreign ministers will travel today to the city of Quito to express their fullest support to the constitutional president of the Republic of Ecuador, Mr. Rafael Correa Delgado, and the Ecuadorian people, indispensable participants in the process of full reestablishment of the democratic institutionality in this country. 6\\\\. Agree to adopt an additional protocol to the constitutive treaty of the Unasur, which shall establish the democratic clause From: was issued condemning the coup attempt, reaffirming the regional compromise with democratic institutions, peace, rule of law, constitutional order and human rights as means to regional integration, and announcing the adoption of a Democratic Clause as an additional protocol to the Unasur Constitutive Treaty at the next Head of State summit in Guyana, on 26 November. It was established that, in the event of further attempts, immediate and concrete steps would be taken, such as the closure of borders, suspension of commerce, air traffic, energy, services, and other supplies. It was also decided that the Foreign Ministers of the South American countries travel to Quito on 1 October morning. =International= Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez condemned the coup attempt, and stated that he and other South American leaders were \\"mobilizing to reject the coup\\". Chilean president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era also declared \\"absolute and total support for President Correa\\", and called for all democratic countries in South America to support Ecuadorian democracy. The Chilean ambassador to Ecuador, later claimed that the events had \\"definitely not been a coup d'√©tat\\". Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru and Spain also expressed full support for Correa's government. Argentina's Foreign Affairs Minister, H√©ctor Timerman, said \\"Latin American democracies will not allow a repeat in Ecuador of the coup in Honduras.\\" Former Argentine president Eduardo Duhalde called the events a \\"coup d'etat.\\" The ruling government in Honduras also expressed its support for Ecuador. The ruling Honduran government is not recognized by Ecuador on the grounds of the coup in Honduras in 2009 against Manuel Zelaya. It condemned \\"any action that violates the constitutional order\\" in Ecuador. \\"Honduras, its people and its government expresses its unqualified support for the democratic institutions of the Republic of Ecuador and advocate return to civic normality,\\" said the Honduran Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Support from Honduras, observed CNN, \\"came a little over a year after a military-led coup toppled the democratically elected president there.\\" Colombia said it had shut its border with Ecuador in solidarity with Correa. Peru shut its border with Ecuador due to unrest, with President Alan Garc√≠a saying it would not reopen \\"until Democratic authority is restored.\\" Iran's ambassador in Ecuador, Majid Salehi, said he was monitoring the situation and that it \\"fully supported Correa's legal government throughout the incident.\\" He also added that Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki talked to Correa later. In the conversation, Correa stressed that ties between the two states were strong and \\"certain countries were seeking to damage Iran-Ecuador relations\\" but emphasised a will to further strengthen ties after saying \\"Ecuador would not allow any country to interfere in its foreign relations.\\" Ahmadinejad, in turn, welcomed their growing ties saying \\"Iran and Ecuador enjoy deep, brotherly relations.\\" The United States declared support for Correa through its ambassador to the Organization of American States. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed \\"full support for President Rafael Correa, and the institutions of democratic government in that country.\\" On 5 October, Ecuadorian foreign minister Ricardo Pati√±o said \\"I firmly believe that Mr. Obama had nothing to do with this. I hope, and trust that neither his (immediate subordinates) did. Academic analysis On 4 October, New York University professor of history Greg Grandin stated that \\"it's still early to tell exactly what happened\\" and in his initial analysis said, \\"the government has made a lot of, I think, accurate accusations that it was not just a spontaneous social protest against austerity. It was too coordinated. It happened simultaneously in a number of cities, a number of barracks. Sectors of the air force joined in immediately. It seems like there have been sectors that have been dissatisfied with Correa within the military. And certainly, a past president, Lucio Guti√©rrez, ... immediately came out and called Correa illegitimate and called for him to step down.\\" Asylum in Czech Republic On Monday 2 July 2012, Czech Republic gave political asylum to lawyer Pablo Guerrero Martinez, who, with more than 111 people, was accused of sabotage and terrorism by the facts raised in the public channel Ecuador TV on Thursday 30 September 2010. He became well-known together with other 12 persons prosecuted by the government with the name of Los Trece Pablo Guerrero Martinez, lawyer, journalist, activist and defender of freedom of expression in his country, was a candidate for Concentraci√≥n de Fuerzas Populares in the presidential election of 2009. The Czech government textually said that: \\"Criminal proceedings that his country is continuing against the applicant and twelve others have all the elements of a political process, and the penalty he could receive is unrelated to the seriousness of the fault\\".http://www.elcomercio.com/politica/Pablo-Guerrero-sudamericano- Republica-Checa_0_730127191.html See also * 2000 Ecuadorean coup d'√©tat * 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt * 2004 Haitian coup d'√©tat * 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat References External links * Public Service Organic Law ‚Äì  Hoy- Chronology of the events * Ecuador Declares State of Emergency ‚Äì video report by Democracy Now!

The entire run of the series' 431 hour-long episodes was produced in color. The premiere was on September 12, 1959, and the final episode broadcast on January 16, 1973. In its initial season, Bonanza aired on Saturday evenings and placed at number 45 in the Nielsen ratings. During its second season, the series moved up to number 17. Bonanza was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 PM at the start of its third season. In that time slot, the ratings soared and the series become second only to Wagon Train as the most popular program on American prime time television. It remained in the top ten of the ratings until its twelfth season and ranked at number one in its sixth, seventh, and eighth seasons. Bonanza also became a worldwide success as it was broadcast in nearly 50 countries, including Canada, Brazil, Yugoslavia, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Australia, and Japan. Bonanza is set around the Ponderosa Ranch near Virginia City, Nevada and chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, consisting of Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) and his three sons (each by a different wife), Adam (Pernell Roberts), Eric \\"Hoss\\" (Dan Blocker), and Joseph (Michael Landon). Veteran actor Victor Sen Yung played the ranch cook, Hop Sing. In 1964, Pernell Roberts began expressing a desire to leave the series, and so prospective replacements were introduced via Barry Coe as Little Joe's wayward maternal half-brother Clay, and Guy Williams as Ben's nephew Will Cartwright. However, Roberts was persuaded to complete his contract, and remained through season six. The characters of Clay and Will were discontinued. In the ninth season, David Canary was added to the cast as ranch hand/foreman Candy Canady. After four years with the series, Canary left due to a contract dispute. In the twelfth season, Mitch Vogel joined the cast as Jamie Hunter, a teenage orphan who is adopted by Ben Cartwright. Following Dan Blocker's death in May 1972 after season thirteen ended, Greene, Landon, and Vogel continued the series into a fourteenth season, with Canary returning as Candy (reportedly approached by Landon) and Tim Matheson was introduced as ex-prisoner and newly hired ranch- hand Griff King. The program was moved to Tuesday nights where it slipped badly in the ratings to number 52 and was subsequently cancelled. Bonanza has, however, continued to be popular in syndication. From 1964‚Äì1967, \\" Bonanza \\" became the most watched show in the U.S. The first ten seasons have been released on DVD in Region 1, and the eleventh season will be released on October 27, 2020.

Lorne Greene, who was to have reprised his role as Ben Cartwright, died before production began, and was replaced by John Ireland as Ben's brother, Aaron Cartwright. Michael Landon Jr. played the role of Little Joe's son, Benjamin Cartwright. Landon Jr. again played Benjamin Cartwright in a second television film Bonanza: The Return. Dirk Blocker, the son of Dan Blocker, played a supporting role in this film which, in its original broadcast on November 28, 1993, was preceded by Back to Bonanza, a one-hour special devoted to the original series. A third TV movie, Bonanza: Under Attack, aired January 15, 1995. Landon Jr. also starred in this film. In 2001‚Äì2002, a \\"prequel\\" series, Ponderosa, aired on the PAX-TV network.

It is the ruins of a once fortified estate, consisting of houses surrounded by a wall and a moat. In the Middle Ages, Lojsta Castle was a defence-structure, placed on an island in one of the small Lojsta Lakes in the middle of Gotland.Tim Ecott, On Gotland pond, The Guardian, 20 August 2005. The fortress is believed to have been used by the Vitalians who supported the captured Swedish king at the time, Albert of Mecklenburg. The Vitalians were pirates and they used Gotland as their base. In 1404, they were defeated by the Teutonic Knights and forced to relinquish Lojsta Castle and the other two strongholds they had on Gotland. Today there is not much remaining of the stronghold. In the beginning of the 20th century, archaeologists surveyed the area but the theories they proposed are questioned today, for example, observations about three house foundations in the fortress. The buildings were most likely made out of wood, about , and today there are no traces of them above ground. The fortress was surrounded by a dug moat, long, wide and up to high, that together with an embankment and a palisade separated the fortress' inner courtyard from the outer. Today, the lake's surface level is estimated at about lower than it was during the Middle Ages and it is divided into three smaller lakes. The remains of the fortress is situated between the Slottstr√§sk and the Brotr√§sk lakes. When the fortress was in use, it had a drawbridge to the mainland, of which you can still see remains. Nowadays the ruins of the fortress can be reached by land.  Lojsta Hall  Lojsta Hall About northeast of the Lojsta Castle, is the Lojsta Hall, a reconstructed Iron Age building. It is built on the remaining foundation of an Iron Age house. The site was excavated in 1929 by John Nihl√©n. The archeological finds were few and not very remarkable, but they suggests that the house had been inhabited during the Migration Period. Inside the remains of the foundation, parts of two log boats were found. In 1932, a reconstruction of the building was erected, showing how the building might have looked during the Iron Age. The people and their animals probably lived together in the hall. The inhabitants raised livestock, but trade was also an important part of their livelihood. The roof of the hall is covered with saw-sedge, a common plant on the Gotlandic mires.

Equivalently, a periodic Euclidean graph is a periodic realization of an abelian covering graph over a finite graph. A Euclidean graph is uniformly discrete if there is a minimal distance between any two vertices. Periodic graphs are closely related to tessellations of space (or honeycombs) and the geometry of their symmetry groups, hence to geometric group theory, as well as to discrete geometry and the theory of polytopes, and similar areas. Much of the effort in periodic graphs is motivated by applications to natural science and engineering, particularly of three-dimensional crystal nets to crystal engineering, crystal prediction (design), and modeling crystal behavior. Periodic graphs have also been studied in modeling very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. Basic formulation A Euclidean graph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of points (sometimes called vertices or nodes) and E is a set of edges (sometimes called bonds), where each edge joins two vertices. While an edge connecting two vertices u and v is usually interpreted as the set { u, v }, an edge is sometimes interpreted as the line segment connecting u and v so that the resulting structure is a CW complex. There is a tendency in the polyhedral and chemical literature to refer to geometric graphs as nets (contrast with polyhedral nets), and the nomenclature in the chemical literature differs from that of graph theory. Most of the literature focuses on periodic graphs that are uniformly discrete in that there exists e > 0 such that for any two distinct vertices, their distance apart is |u ‚Äì v> e. From the mathematical view, a Euclidean periodic graph is a realization of an infinite-fold abelian covering graph over a finite graph. =Obtaining periodicity= The identification and classification of the crystallographic space groups took much of the Nineteenth century, and the confirmation of the completeness of the list was finished by the theorems of Evgraf Fedorov and Arthur Schoenflies. The problem was generalized in David Hilbert's eighteenth Problem, and the Fedorov‚ÄìSchoenflies Theorem was generalized to higher dimensions by Ludwig Bieberbach. The Fedorov‚ÄìSchoenflies theorem asserts the following. Suppose that one is given a Euclidean graph in 3-space such that the following are true: # It is uniformly discrete in that there exists e > 0 such that for any two distinct vertices, their distance apart is |u ‚Äì v> e. # It fills space in the sense that for any plane in 3-space, there exist vertices of the graph on both sides of the plane. # Each vertex is of finite degree or valency. # There are finitely many orbits of vertices under the symmetry group of the geometric graph. Then the Euclidean graph is periodic in that the vectors of translations in its symmetry group span the underlying Euclidean space, and its symmetry group is a crystallographic space group. The interpretation in science and engineering is that since a Euclidean graph representing a material extending through space must satisfy conditions (1), (2), and (3), non-crystalline substances from quasicrystals to glasses must violate (4). However, in the last quarter century, quasicrystals have been recognized to share sufficiently many chemical and physical properties with crystals that there is a tendency to classify quasicrystals as \\"crystals\\" and to adjust the definition of \\"crystal\\" accordingly. Mathematics and computation Much of the theoretical investigation of periodic graphs has focused on the problems of generating and classifying them. =Classification problems= Most of the work on classification problems has focused on three dimensions, particularly on the classification of crystal nets, i.e., of periodic graphs that could serve as descriptions or designs for placement of atoms or molecular objects, with bonds indicated by edges, in a crystal. One of the more popular classification criteria is graph isomorphism, not to be confused with crystallographic isomorphism. Two periodic graphs are often called topologically equivalent if they are isomorphic, although not necessarily homotopic. Even though the graph isomorphism problem is polynomial time reducible to crystal net topological equivalence (making topological equivalence a candidate for being \\"computationally intractable\\" in the sense of not being polynomial time computable), a crystal net is generally regarded as novel if and only if no topologically equivalent net is known. This has focused attention on topological invariants. One invariant is the array of minimal cycles (often called rings in the chemistry literature) arrayed about generic vertices and represented in a Schlafli symbol. The cycles of a crystal net are related to another invariant, that of the coordination sequence (or shell map in topology), which is defined as follows. First, a distance sequence from a vertex v in a graph is the sequence n1, n2, n3, ..., where ni is the number of vertices of distance i from v. The coordination sequence is the sequence s1, s2, s3, ..., where si is the weighted mean of the i-th entries of the distance sequences of vertices of the (orbits of the) crystal nets, where the weights are the asymptotic proportion of vertices of each orbit. The cumulative sums of the coordination sequence is denoted the topological density, and the sum of the first ten terms (plus 1 for the zero- th term) ‚Äì often denoted TD10 ‚Äì is a standard search term in crystal net databases. SeeM. Kotani and T. Sunada \\"Geometric aspects of large deviations for random walks on crystal lattices\\" In: Microlocal Analysis and Complex Fourier Analysis (T. Kawai and K. Fujita, Ed.), World Scientific, 2002, pp. 215-237. for a mathematical aspect of topological density which is closely related to the large deviation property of simple random walks. Another invariant arises from the relationship between tessellations and Euclidean graphs. If we regard a tessellation as an assembly of (possibly polyhedral) solid regions, (possibly polygonal) faces, (possibly linear) curves, and vertices ‚Äì that is, as a CW-complex ‚Äì then the curves and vertices form a Euclidean graph (or 1-skeleton) of the tessellation. (In addition, the adjacency graph of the tiles induces another Euclidean graph.) If there are finitely many prototiles in the tessellation, and the tessellation is periodic, then the resulting Euclidean graph will be periodic. Going in the reverse direction, the prototiles of a tessellation whose 1-skeleton is (topologically equivalent to) the given periodic graph, one has another invariant, and it is this invariant that is computed by the computer program TOPOS. =Generating periodic graphs= There are several extant periodic graph enumeration algorithms, including modifying extant nets to produce new ones, but there appear to be two major classes of enumerators. One of the major systematic crystal net enumeration algorithms extant is based on the representation of tessellations by a generalization of the Schl√§fli symbol by Boris Delauney and Andreas Dress, by which any tessellation (of any dimension) may be represented by a finite structure, which we may call a Dress‚ÄìDelaney symbol. Any effective enumerator of Dress‚ÄìDelaney symbols can effectively enumerate those periodic nets that correspond to tessellations. The three- dimensional Dress‚ÄìDelaney symbol enumerator of Delgado-Friedrichs et al. has predicted several novel crystal nets that were later synthesized. Meanwhile, a two-dimensional Dress‚ÄìDelaney enumerator generating reticulations of two- dimensional hyperbolic space that is surgically dissected and wrapped around a triply periodic minimal surface such as the Gyroid, Diamond or Primitive, has generated many novel crystal nets. Another extant enumerator is currently focused on generating plausible crystal nets of zeolites. The extension of the symmetry group to 3-space permits the characterization of a fundamental domain (or region) of 3-space, whose intersection with the net induces a subgraph which, in general position, will have one vertex from each orbit of vertices. This subgraph may or may not be connected, and if a vertex lies on an axis of rotation or some other fixed point of some symmetry of the net, the vertex may necessarily lie on the boundary of any fundamental region. In this case, the net may be generated by applying the symmetry group to the subgraph in the fundamental region. Other programs have been developed that similarly generate copies of an initial fragment and glue them into a periodic graph See also *Periodic graphs as models of crystals for design.

In terms of its optical properties, Perite is anisotropic which means the velocity of light varies depending on direction through the mineral (i.e. it is birefringent). Its calculated relief is 1.45-1.461, which is moderate. It is colorless in plane polarized light, and it is weakly pleochroic. Perite is found in areas near igneous extrusions in places like the Western United States, Southern Australia, and scattered around Europe.  Crystallography  Perite belongs to the Orthorhombic crystal system, and has the properties of 2/m 2/m 2/m crystal class. Therefore, perite has 3 mirror planes and 3 twofold rotation axes.

The bridge shares design features with the larger Prince Edward Viaduct. The Crawford Bridge was a triple span Arch bridge built in 1914 to 1915 to replace an early wooden bridge (1884) that spanned Garrison Creek in the area known today's as Trinity- Bellwoods.http://torontoist.com/2008/05/historicist_buried_under_bellwoods.php The bridge's design was influenced by Public Works Commissioner R.C. Harris with a more pleasing structure for the public. The bridge was built to allow residents in the new residential development along Crawford Street to cross over the valley over from north of Lobb Avenue to the south of Dundas Street West. In the 1960s the valley on either side was filled in with earth dug from building the Bloor subway. It was the last of few bridges that spanned Garrison Creek to be removed, most before the 1940s. The actual bridge was not torn down, but rather buried with only the railings and lamp posts removed. The City of Toronto government performed maintenance work in 2004 that narrowed the roadbed and rebuilt sidewalks on both sides. Foaming grout was added to fill the voids of the bridge with hope for future restoration of the entire bridge. Today there are no visible signs of the bridge being present other than plaques and sidewalk markers added in 2008 by the City of Toronto. Once rolling landscape, houses and flat Trinity Bellwoods Park now surround the bridge.

Misha Geller  Moscow years (1937‚Äì1978)  Geller was born in Moscow in 1937 in a Jewish family. He started to play the violin at the age of 7, but later on he developed a passion for the viola. He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory in 1963 as a viola player and composer. He studied composition with Professor Evgeny Golubev and Alfred Schnittke (orchestration). As a viola player he was awarded the Gold Medal at the International Competition in Helsinki (1962). In 1966 he was a founding member of the Composer's Union String Quartet, together with Alexander Arenkow (violin), Dimitri Ferschtman (cello) and Sergei Pischugin (violin). When Russian string quartets have achieved international recognition they are given the name of a great Russian composer.http://libraries.ucsd.edu/historyofucsd/newsreleases/1982/19820120c.html The group won the First Prize at the International String Quartet Competition in Li√®ge, Belgium in 1969 and the name Glinka was bestowed on them. With the Glinka Quartet Geller performed in many countries around the world, made a large number of records and recorded for radio and television. From 1968 up until his emigration in 1978 he was a member of the Soviet Composer's Society in Moscow. He obtained commissions from the Russian Broadcasting Corporation to compose for the Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and other symphony orchestras and to create chamber music, vocal cycles and a filmed opera for television titled The Women's Revolt with the cast of the Bolshoi Theatre, conducted by Mark Ermler. Especially acclaimed was his Sonata for Violin and Piano (1969), which was dedicated to its first performers: violinist Alexei Michlin (the Gold Medal winner of the Queen Elizabeth Competition in Brussels in 1963) and Georgian pianist Ziala Kwernadze, laureate of the Vianna da Motta International Music Competition in Lisbon in 1964). This composition was published by the Union of Soviet Composers in 1976 and the record label Melodiya produced a record with this composition. Music critic N. Dolinsky is cited on the cover of the record: ‚Ä¶This composition is put together in a very modern fashion, as if written in a new language, full of expression and drama. The whole piece is constructed like a precise, graphical drawing, where every line, every hatching has its own distinct character‚Ä¶ The monologues of the violin are particularly remarkable. They seem to fix your attention on the intense intellectual and creative process of the composer.  Life and work in the Netherlands (1978‚Äì1994)  In 1978 Geller and his family moved to the Netherlands. From 1978‚Äì1980 he played with the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra as their principal violinist. In 1980 he became a member of the re-formed Glinka Quartet together with Dimitri Ferschtman (cello), Zino Vinnikov (violin) and Kees Hulsman (violin), which successfully performed and recorded around the world. Geller gave solo performances as a viola player and played with many European Orchestras. His most memorable performances were of Mozart¬¥s Symphony Concertante with the violinist Jean-Jacques Kantorow and of Berlioz¬¥s Harold in Italy. The Rhein -Zeitung in Germany wrote about his performance there in 1982: He played with an exceptional delicacy of phrasing‚Ä¶ conveying deep warmth and burning inspiration. He took part in the performances of his own compositions, such as the duet for viola and cello Psalm Music for 8 Strings (D. Ferschtman, cello) with premiere at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam in 1979. The duet was also played by various European musicians and recorded in the Netherlands, Germany and France. Geller's performance of Fantasy for viola and piano (1980) was recorded with different pianists by several Dutch broadcasting organisations: KRO, VARA, AVRO. 1982 saw the premiere of his Dialogue for Viola and 12 instruments with the Dutch Radio Chamber Orchestra, conductor Ernest Bour. Geller composed for chamber ensembles, e.g. the String Quintet in commission of the Johan Wagenaar Foundation in the Netherlands (1984). His compositions were performed in the UK, Croatia, France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. He held teaching posts at the University Colleges for the Arts in Amsterdam and Utrecht at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. He served on the juries of several competitions such as The Julius Isserlis Scholarship of the Royal Philharmonic Society in England and gave Master Classes in Germany and the UK. His successful career as a violist was abruptly ended by a sudden stroke. He was forced to stop performing, which led to his emotional decision to stop teaching as well.  Second career: traditional Chinese medicine (1992‚Äì1997)  After being forced to give up his career as a viola player, Misha Geller devoted himself to his other passion: Traditional Chinese Medicine. He graduated from The International Acupuncture Institute in Hong Kong proficient in the ancient Chinese art of healing: Qigong. He worked as a doctor of acupuncture first in the Netherlands and later in Israel, where he was invited to work in co-operation with the Medical Insurance Leumit Health Fund (1994‚Äì1997). In the winter of 1997 Geller was struck by another severe stroke. He was forced to stop working and to get more rest.  Back to the Netherlands (1998‚Äì2007)  He returned to the Netherlands, recovered remarkably well from the physical effects of his stroke and started composing again. He worked as a composer full-time and from 2003 onward he actively took part in the realization of his own musical projects. His musical fairy-tale for children Mishka saw an enthusiastic reception in 2003. His Chamber Opera The Daughters of Lot (An Intimate Treatment of the Sacred Pages, libretto in English by Sandra Geller) for baritone, soprano, mezzo-soprano, piano and percussion is a personal vision on this episode in the Book of Genesis, featuring Lot, his wife and his daughters as the characters in a drama that enlivens the history of mankind. Performances took place in 2003 in churches and cathedrals throughout the Netherlands. Misha Geller has always been inspired by the magic of the visual arts. For the program Homage to Marc Chagall he composed Trio for Piano, Violin and Cello and Russian Fantasy for cello and piano. His Ballad for Chamber Orchestra was inspired by the watercolors of Dutch ‚Äì French painter Ary Scheffer. De fresco's of Piero della Francesca are the d√©cor for his Opera ‚Äì Ballet The Death of Adam and his oratorio Solomon. Geller's admiration for Francisco de Goya is expressed in his composition for viola and piano Goya's Caprichos, where music leads you into the fascinating world of Goya's sinister masquerade. The Garden of Earthly Delights of Hieronymus Bosch is reflected in his composition Nebo for viola, piano and accordion. These two compositions were performed, accompanied by video impressions of the works of Goya and Bosch in the program Image, Mysticism & Music. Famous images from Russian fairy-tales were shown as a video impression during the performance of Geller's composition for clarinet and piano Russian Fairy-tales. His Chamber Opera Narcissus based on Ovid's myth of Narcissus, was inspired by Salvador Dal√≠'s painting Metamorphosis of Narcissus (libretto in English by Sandra Geller) Geller's music also reflects his interest in literature and poetry. He composed romances on Russian, Bulgarian and Japanese poems. For the music theatre production Requiem for a Poet he composed music inspired by the poetry of Osip Mandelstam and Marina Tsvetaeva in Dutch translation by Charles B. Timmer. His Symphony is inspired by The Old Man and the Sea, the novella by Ernest Hemingway. Chamber Comic Opera Madam Popov, is based on the story of Anton Chekhov The Bear (with libretto in English, written by composer). The duet The Royal Bee is an expressive musical story, inspired by the phenomenon of the queen bee. The premiere of his String Quartet Flashback, performed by the German Rubin Quartet in 2007, was the last performance attended by the composer. Michael Geller died suddenly in December 2007 in his home in Vught, Netherlands.  Overview of compositions  =Operas= * The Women's Revolt. Comic opera in 5 episodes based on the stories by M.

Monaco performed the non-singing role of Bo Peep, with Brown portraying the singing Peep Diva. While the show does feature nudity, neither Monaco nor Brown appeared nude. Monaco performed in the production until her 3-month contract expired in June 2009. Although it was briefly rumored that Lindsay Lohan would replace her, the role of Bo Peep ultimately went to Holly Madison. Madison started with a three-month contract, but was so popular that she was renewed for another three months, and then assumed the role on a permanent basis. Melanie Brown portrayed the role of Peep Diva from the opening of the show until her three-month contract expired in June 2009, when she was replaced by Shoshana Bean, who also had a three- month contract. In September 2009, it was announced that Bean would be replaced by former Danity Kane member Aubrey O'Day. Both Madison and O'Day, unlike their predecessors, performed topless in the show. Blogger Perez Hilton created a brief controversy when he posted unauthorized photos of O'Day's topless performance, criticizing both O'Day's performance and her physique. The show closed briefly from JanuaryMarch 2010, while it was retooled. A new version of the production opened on March 1, 2010, with Holly Madison as the sole female celebrity lead performer as Bo Peep, along with American Idol alum Josh Strickland as the male lead (Strickland had been playing the role since the show started, but the role was expanded in retooling). The role of Peep Diva still existed in the show, but it was no longer reserved for celebrities, and was filled by singer Cheaza Figueroa (who had been the understudy in the role for all previous Peep Divas). For one week from September 13 to 19, 2010, the role of Bo Peep was played by Angel Porrino, who gained celebrity as Madison's personal assistant on her reality TV series Holly's World. In October 2012, Madison left Peepshow because of her pregnancy, and Porrino once again stepped in as a temporary replacement (with a contract from October 22 to December 2). On December 3, 2012, Coco Austin assumed the role of Bo Peep. She continued to play the role until the show's last performance on September 1, 2013.

The case is unsolved as of . 1959 murder case Authorities believe that 24-year-old Christine Walker arrived at the family's farm home around 4pm on Saturday, December 19, 1959, where she was raped, then murdered by gunshot. Her husband Cliff, 25, then arrived with their 3-year-old son Jimmie and 1-year-old daughter Debbie. Cliff was ambushed and killed by gunshot. Jimmie and Debbie were then murdered. Jimmie was shot, and Debbie was shot in addition to being drowned in the bathtub. The actual cause of death is unknown, and she could have been shot in the bathtub. News stories noted there were gifts around the Christmas tree. Physical evidence left at the scene included a bloody cowboy boot, a cellophane strip from a Kool cigarette wrapper, and a fingerprint on the bathtub faucet handle. A serial killer named Emmett Monroe Spencer confessed to the murders, but the confession was discredited by Sarasota County Sheriff Ross Boyer, who labeled Spencer a pathological liar. Spencer's confession was \\"determined to be cleverly constructed from real murders written up in newspapers and true-crime novels that he liked to read.\\" In 1994, a bartender in Stroudsburg claimed that one of her customers had boasted of killing the Walker family; this tip was never verified. Police never identified a motive, and 587 people were suspects at one time or another. The case remains open. 2012 developments In 2012, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office began investigating possible links between the Walker family murders and Perry Smith and Richard \\"Dick\\" Hickock, who had been convicted and executed for the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. The Clutter murders were the topic of Truman Capote's 1965 best-selling true crime book In Cold Blood. While that book devoted several pages to the Walker case, it dismissed a possible connection to Hickock and Smith, asserting that the two men had an alibi for that day. However, records and witness accounts collected by Kansas and Florida investigators show several factual contradictions in Capote's account. The Sheriff's Office admitted that Hickock and Smith had been considered suspects as far back as 1960. After killing four members of the Clutter family in Kansas, 34 days before the Walker murders, Smith and Hickock fled to Florida in a stolen car, and were spotted at least a dozen times between Tallahassee and Miami. The pair checked into a Miami Beach motel, about four hours from Osprey, and checked out on the morning of the Walker murders. At some point that day, Smith and Hickock bought items at a Sarasota department store, just a few miles from the Walker home. One witness said that the taller of the two men \\"had a scratched-up face.\\" The pair was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 30, 1959, for the Clutter murders, and were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965. While a polygraph test appeared to clear them of the Walker murders, at least one expert has asserted that polygraph machines of the early 1960s were notoriously inaccurate. According to Sheriff's records, the Walkers had been considering buying a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air, the same kind of stolen car that Smith and Hickock were driving through Florida. It is therefore believed that Smith and Hickock may have gained entry to the Walker home on the pretense of selling their car. In December 2012, Sarasota County investigators announced they were seeking an order to exhume Smith's and Hickock's bodies from Mount Muncie Cemetery, in the hopes that mitochondrial DNA extracted from their bones could be matched to semen found at the Walker home. Hickock's and Smith's bodies were exhumed and DNA extracted. Kansas authorities stated that they would process the DNA samples with active cases taking higher priority, and that results would take \\"weeks or months.\\" In August 2013, the Sarasota County Sheriff's office announced they were unable to find a match between the DNA of either Perry Smith or Richard Hickock with the samples in the Walker family murder. Only partial DNA could be retrieved, possibly due to degradations of the DNA samples over the decades or contamination in storage, making the outcome one of uncertainty (neither proving nor disproving the involvement of Smith and Hickock). Consequently, investigators have stated that Smith and Hickock still remain the most viable suspects.

The forest is and sits at an elevation of . It is Alabama's largest state forest. According to the Alabama Forestry Commission the primary objective of the state forest is to provide timber for the lumber industry and the secondary objectives are to provide habitats for wildlife and recreational opportunities for people. The forest is open for year-round recreation including hunting, fishing, hiking and camping. History Geneva State Forest was part of the timber lands owned by the Jackson Lumber Company. The lumber company, as was a common practice of the time, clear cut the land. They were left with land that was of little use. Jackson Lumber Company tried to sell the land for as little as 50 cents an acre. When a sale never developed the company donated the land to the State of Alabama rather than continue paying property taxes that generated no income. The land transfer took place during the Great Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a work relief program for young men from unemployed families, established in 1933. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, it was designed to combat unemployment during the 1930s. The CCC operated in every U.S. state. The CCC had several camps in Alabama including one at Geneva State Forest. The young men of the CCC worked to revitalize the forests of Geneva County and southern Alabama. They did this by clearing brush, building access roads and hand planting thousands of tree seedlings. Timber Geneva State Forest is a managed forest. Trees are harvested on a regular basis for multiple uses. The forest largely comprises longleaf pine. The longleaf pine is the official state tree of Alabama. Large forests of the pine once were present along the southeastern Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast of North America, as part of the eastern savannas. These forests were the source of naval stores - resin, turpentine, and timber. The longleaf pine at Geneva State Forest is managed in three stages. The Alabama Forest Commission uses the natural regeneration method in their forest management. The three stages are preparatory cutting, establishment cutting and removal cutting. All three sections undergo an annual controlled burn in which ‚Öì of the unit is set ablaze by foresters. The controlled fires encourage regrowth and provide forage for wildlife. Following removal cutting the forests are allowed to regenerate naturally. It takes 75 years for the forests to regrow. Recreation Geneva State Forest is open to hunting. Common game species include white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels. Other animals hunted and living in the forest include bobcats, foxes, quail and rabbits. Geneva State Forest Lake is a lake this is open for fishing. There is a hiking trail around the lake. Primitive camping is permitted in the state forest.

The main approach of the method is to look at similar or comparable transactions where the acquisition target has a similar business model and similar client base to the company being evaluated. The value of a business is then arrived at using a similar multiple of the company's EBITDA as demonstrated by multiples of EBITDA achieved in past, completed transactions of comparable businesses in the sector. This approach is fundamentally different from that of DCF valuation method, which calculates intrinsic value. Example For instance, Providence Equity Partners acquired Virtual Radiologic Corporation, which is an online clinic that provides radiologist analysis through a virtual network. It was sold for a price of million and an enterprise Value of $242 million. To evaluate a similar unsold company, we would look at what are called the transaction multiples. One popular transaction multiple is EV/EBITDA. For Virtual Radiologic Corporation, the EBITDA at the time of the transaction was $20 million, giving an EBITDA multiple of 12.1x. A similar unsold company, which has EBITDA at $10 Million could expect to be sold for $120 million. In some market segments, the companies do not have high EBITDA, and sometimes a multiple based on revenues (EV/sales) is used instead. To get a more accurate valuation, one should look at the multiples of more than one similar deals that are relatively recent since multiples do change from year to year.

It was the location of the former Seward Park High School, a now-closed comprehensive high school. The school began as P.S. 62 Intermediate, an intermediate school. In 1923 the school pursued an experimental path as a combined junior-senior high school. Two years later, it transformed to a strictly senior high school, with Robert Brodie serving as its first high school principal. Owing to construction of the New York City Subway's IND Sixth Avenue Line (), the school was relocated to the site of a courthouse and the Ludlow Street Jail. The new building was completed in 1929. The school experienced a decline in performance and graduated its last class in June 2006. The building now houses five different small schools: the High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies, New Design High School, the Essex Street Academy -- formerly the High School for History and Communication, the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy, and the Urban Assembly Academy of Government and Law. The small schools showed graduation rates which were much improved over that of the old comprehensive school.

The church is located southwest of the town of Cumming in rural Madison County, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Pope John Paul II visited the church while he was on his first pastoral visit to the United States in 1979. History The significance of St. Patrick's Church is its association with the area that became known as Irish Settlement. with This rural farm community was settled in the early 1850s by Irish immigrants. It was established by the Rev. Timothy Mullen, who had been sent by Bishop Mathias Loras of the Dubuque diocese to Fort Des Moines to serve the small Catholic community there. He was also to establish an Irish colony in central Iowa, similar to several that had already begun in Eastern Iowa. The first were purchased by Bishop Loras. Many of the early families who settled here came from Wisconsin. By 1860, Irish Settlement covered four townships in two counties. Forty of the families resided in Madison County and by 1870 they had increased to 63 families. There was a rivalry between those who settled on the north side of the North River and those who settled on the south side as to who would get the church. The parish was founded in 1852 with the church on the north side. It was the first parish founded in what would become the Diocese of Des Moines. A log structure served as the first church, which was begun by Mullen but finished by Rev. John Kreckel. Itinerant priests served the parish in its early years. The Rev. Francis McCormick was appointed the first resident pastor in 1857, but he did not stay long. The Rev. John Brazill of St. Ambrose Church in Des Moines had the present frame church built to replace the original log structure in 1868. A monument in the parish cemetery commemorates the old church on the site where it stood. St. Patrick's became a parish in the Davenport diocese when it was established in 1881. The parish was divided in 1884 at the North River with the parishioners who lived to the south forming a new parish at Churchville. Other divisions happened soon after that when parishes were begun at St. Mary's and in Winterset. The parish was transferred to the Des Moines diocese when it was created in 1911. =Pope John Paul II visits= The idea for a visit by Pope John Paul II to a rural church was initiated by Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, an American who worked at the Vatican. Des Moines Bishop Maurice Dingman brought him to visit St. Patrick's when they were planning the trip. The parish had been without a pastor so Dingman named a recently ordained priest, Rev. John Richter, to the position. The papal visit took place on October 4, 1979. Pope John Paul led a prayer service for 200 parishioners and gave a reflection based on the Acts of the Apostles \\"that spoke of the gathering for the breaking of the bread and prayers.\\" He also urged them to maintain unity with the diocese and the wider Church. After his visit to St. Patrick's, the pope celebrated Mass at Living History Farms near Des Moines. Architecture St. Patrick's Church is a frame structure that measures , and it has a sacristy attached to the back. It is five bays in length with a round-arch Stained glass window in each bay. A small rose window is located above the altar. A low-pitched gable roof with partially-returned cornices caps the sanctuary. The building has a uniquely tapered bell tower in the front. The bell-chamber has a round-arch louver on each side and it is capped with a hipped roof and a cross. The church is surrounded by of property that includes, timber, grassland, cultivated fields, and the parish cemetery where many of the first parishioners were laid to rest.

Critic Brian Alderson (children's book critic) called him \\"perhaps the most original children's book illustrator of the period\\". He established his reputation with lithographs illustrating This Year: Next Year (1937), a collection of verses by Walter de la Mare. Jones was born in London and studied illustration there from 1920 at Goldsmith's College, under Edmund Sullivan, a former teacher of Arthur Rackham; at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in 1922‚Äì1923; and then on scholarship at the Royal College of Art. Jones's most acclaimed work was Lavender's Blue: A book of nursery rhymes (1954), a collection of nursery rhymes named for one of them, \\"Lavender's Blue\\". The British Library Association awarded Jones \\"Special Commendation\\" for the 1954 Carnegie Medal, which recognised the year's outstanding children's book written by a British subject; it provided a \\"major reason\\" for the organisation to establish its companion Kate Greenaway Medal for illustration that year (1955). Lavender's Blue, published in the U.S. by Franklin Watts in 1956, was named a Notable Book by the American Library Association and to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1960.

The show was broadcast each week from a different Irish town, with a live audience. Competitors were selected from the audience by drawing numbered tickets, prompting many amusing exchanges as they competed for small monetary prizes by answering a series of trivia questions. Musical accompaniment was provided by organist Norman Metcalfe, who frequently provided musical hints to the answers. The centre- piece was a large board with 30 illuminated numbers that indicated remaining prizes. After the host read the question, the lights went out one-by-one (approximately one each second) until either the contestant gave the correct answer or seven lights went out. With each correct answer, each remaining light became worth an increasing amount of money - pre-decimalisation, the progression went 1 shilling, 2 shillings, 5 shillings, 10 shillings, ¬£1, and ¬£5; post-decimalisation, it went 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, ¬£1, and ¬£5; towards the end of the run, the 5p level was removed (contestants correspondingly started with a 10p question) and a ¬£10 level added after the ¬£5 level. During the game, the contestant had two opportunities to call ‚ÄúStop the lights,‚Äù passing on the question and preventing the potential prize from decreasing further. When 13 lights remained, the host gave the contestant a bonus challenge from \\"Card #13.\\" The challenge could take many forms, such as singing a verse from a favorite song, or answering all of the questions they had been asked during the game so far. If completed, the contestant won an extra cash prize regardless of the result of the game. In addition, a secret number was designated before the game, shown to the home audience, but not to the studio audience. The first contestant of the show, if any, to have the lights stopped exactly on the secret number won a bonus \\"super prize\\" regardless of the outcome of the game. The contestant could end the game after any correct answer and take the prize he or she had based on that question's prize level and the number of lights remaining. For instance, a contestant who answered the 50p question with 20 lights remaining could end the game and take ¬£10 (20 lights times 50p). The contestant's game also ended either when the contestant correctly answered a question at the highest money level or ran out of lights. In addition, if time ran out during a contestant's game, the contestant immediately won whatever prize he or she had at that point. For instance, a contestant who had a full board of 30 lights when time was called and was answering a 5p-level question would win ¬£1.50. At the end of the show, all of the contestants faced one final question on the buzzers against a full board of 30 lights, and the contestant who answered the question correctly won ¬£1 per light remaining. The show's catchphrase \\"Stop The Lights!\\" is still used by Irish people to indicate mock amazement.

The name Flivver originates from a slang term of the same name used during the early part of the 20th century to refer to any small car that gave a rough ride. Service history Initially, the Flivvers ran on the original IRT mainline express, which utilized the modern day IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line north of 42nd Street on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, the modern day 42nd Street Shuttle, and the modern day IRT Lexington Avenue Line south of 42nd Street on Park Avenue South. Following the 1918 IRT expansion into the modern \\"H\\" system that serves Manhattan's East and West sides separately with the 42nd Street Shuttle connecting them, the Flivvers ran primarily on the Seventh Avenue Express (today served by the 2 route). Later, beginning in the 1950s, the cars also ran on the East Side line, providing express service on Lexington Avenue to both the Jerome Avenue and White Plains Road branches (served today by the 4 and 5 routes respectively). The last Flivver to run in service ran on the Lexington‚ÄìWhite Plains Road Express in 1962, and was removed from service at that time. No examples of this car remain. Description Flivver Lo-Vs were arranged in mixed trains consisting of trailers and motor cars. While trailer cars were equipped with brakes, but no air compressors or motors, motor cars were equipped with all three. The Flivvers were part of the first generation of Lo-V subway cars, along with the first Steinways. Flivvers utilized parts from the IRT Composites, which were being modified at the time to provide service on the IRT's Manhattan and Bronx elevated lines beginning in 1916. The interior and exterior of a Flivver Lo-V were similar to the rest of the IRT fleet that predated it. Individual, square rattan seats were arranged in a longitudinal seating pattern along the side walls of the car. Three doors on each side ‚Äì two at the end vestibules and one in the center ‚Äì provided for entrance and exit from the car. Incandescent lighting was used, and paddle ceiling fans cooled the car. Clerestory style vents in the upper roof opened for additional airflow. The car body was made entirely of steel, with drop sash windows running down the sides of the car. The cars used metal signage displayed in the side windows of the car to indicate destinations and routes. Kerosene lamps were displayed on the ends of trains as running lights ‚Äì white for the front of the train and red for the rear. \\"Lo-V\\" is short for \\"Low Voltage\\", which refers to the cars' form of propulsion control. Earlier Composite and \\"Hi-V\\" (High Voltage) equipment that ran on the IRT utilized a 600 volt DC circuit that ran directly through the motorman's master controller to control the car's propulsion. The 600 volts was also trainlined through the whole train by the use of high voltage jumper cables. However, Lo-V equipment used trainlined battery voltage (32 volts) in the motor control circuit to move high voltage (600 volts) contacts underneath each car, which would control the car's propulsion. This tremendously improved the safety of the equipment for both train crews and shop personnel alike. Flivver Lo-Vs maintained the older braking system of the High Voltage equipment. The older setup, known as AMRE, featured different notches on the brake stand for the motorman, depending on if he was operating his brakes with electric control (which synchronized the brakes on all cars of the train electrically) or if he was operating pneumatically (which did not synchronize the brakes and took longer to react). The newer setup, to be known as AMUE, came on the Steinways and Standard Lo-Vs, but never on the Flivvers. AMUE brake stands would utilize the same notch to apply brakes, regardless of whether or not the electric brake was active. However, the Flivvers maintained the older AMRE setup, which had also been used on many of the Hi-V cars. They were the only car with Low Voltage propulsion to use the AMRE setup. Because the Low Voltage Propulsion system was not compatible with earlier High Voltage equipment, the Flivvers could not run with those cars. Because the Flivver AMRE braking setup was not compatible with the other Low Voltage equipment, the Flivvers could not run with those cars either. Therefore, they could only run amongst themselves. Further, they were found to perform better in certain specific combinations than others, so they were left to run in these \\"optimal\\" configurations. When arranged in less than optimal configurations, the cars often gave a very rough ride with many bucking. In optimal configurations, they were respectable performers. Many IRT crews commented about the speed of these cars, even noting that at the end of their service lives, they were still significantly faster than the other equipment running. This was because, towards the end of their operation, trailers cars were eliminated and the Flivvers operated in trains of all motor cars. Historians hypothesize that their speed was a large reason why they were typically assigned to express services throughout their lifetimes.

The show was hosted by Ronan Collins and featured two teams, one captained by Twink and the other by Brendan Grace. Later versions of the programme had Derek Davis as captain of the men's team. Format The game was based on charades, a party game where players used mime rather than speaking to demonstrate a name, phrase, book, play, film or television programme. Each player was given roughly two minutes to act out their given subject in front of his/her team, and if the others were unsuccessful in guessing correctly, the opposing team would have a chance to answer for a bonus point.

Rueda Medina was allegedly in charge of operations under La Familia leaders Nazario Moreno Gonz√°lez and Jos√© de Jes√∫s M√©ndez Vargas, who are both on Mexico's most-wanted list of drug suspects. Criminal career Rueda Medina was born on 15 December 1969 in the state of Michoac√°n, and first worked as a tortilla seller before deciding to start his criminal career by stealing automobiles in the year 2000. In 2004, he became the La Familia Michoacana's hitmen lieutenant responsible for tracking down cartel rivals and ordering gunmen to kill members of the Milenio Cartel, which had an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel. He reportedly started working for the cartel in 2000, when the drug lords Carlos Rosales Mendoza, Jos√© de Jes√∫s M√©ndez Vargas, and Nazario Moreno Gonz√°lez were fighting against the Valencia brothers of the Milenio organization for the control of the smuggling routes in western Mexico. During the mid-2000s, Rosales Mendoza headed the cartel and aligned with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas to fight the Milenio Cartel. But after the arrests of Rosales Mendoza and of the Gulf Cartel leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, Rueda Medina's group broke relations with Los Zetas along with M√©ndez Vargas and Moreno Gonz√°lez. By 2006, he was in charge of coordinating the cartel's narcotics fabrication and smuggling operations. He was also responsible for assigning regional leaders of the cartel, contacting international drug suppliers, and infiltrating several police forces where La Familia Michoacana held a stronghold. =Arrest= After six months of police intelligence, Rueda Medina was arrested on 11 July 2009 by elements of the Mexican Federal Police while he was arriving at his residence in the capital city of Morelia, Michoac√°n. Minutes later, a group of more than two dozen gunmen tossed fragmentation grenades and opened fire on the federal police offices where Rueda Medina was being held. Rueda Medina was then taken to Mexico City by dozens of policemen and soldiers. A few hours after Rueda's arrest, convoys of heavily armed gunmen ambushed federal forces across the western state of Michoac√°n. The gunmen tossed hand grenades and opened fire on police stations and at the hotel installations where the officers slept in six major Michoacan cities. There were also attacks in the states of Guerrero and Guanajuato. Five federal officers and two soldiers were killed that day, with ten federal policemen wounded by the reprisals. Two days later, on 13 July, La Familia gunmen continued the retaliation with an ambush to a police bus, killing 12 federal agents. The 11 men and one woman had been kidnapped, tortured, and killed while off-duty as a retaliation attack for the arrest of Rueda Medina. The killing of the agents, whose bodies were found along with a warning note, showed that La Familia Michoacana was eager to directly attack the Federal government of Mexico. Rueda has been convicted of multiple crimes and is being held at Penal del Altiplano, a maximum security prison. Kingpin Act sanction On 25 February 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Rueda Medina under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with twenty-one other international criminals and ten foreign entities. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. See also * War on Drugs * Mexican drug war * M√©rida Initiative References  External links  * Captura Polic√≠a Federal a coordinador operativo de \\"La Familia\\" ‚Äî Federal government of Mexico (Video) Living people La Familia Michoacana traffickers Mexican prisoners and detainees 1969 births People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act People from Par√°cuaro ","title":"Arnoldo Rueda Medina"},{"id":"29009278","text":"Tekmen is a village in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, in Osmancƒ±k district of √áorum Province. It is a small village, with a population of 340 people. Though it is in the Black Sea Region, it carries typical properties of villages of the Central Anatolia Region. The village economy is based on agriculture and animal husbandry. At the beginning of the 1970s, the Tekmen people began to emigrate from the village to the surrounding cities. Since then, the population of Tekmenians has decreased by around 3,000. The village consists of five rural districts: Central Tekmen, Karata≈ü, Yukarƒ±saltuk, A≈üaƒüƒ±saltuk, and Baƒülar. Each district consists of specific families. For example, only the Soruklu family live in Karata≈ü, and in Baƒülar only the Hacƒ±lars and Hacƒ±yusufs.  Education  H√ºseyin G√ºlburun was appointed as a teacher to the village in 1945. He taught reading and writing to prepare students for primary school. Many of his former students have become civil servants. The second teacher to come to the village was Mehmet Kazanan. The Tekmen primary school is currently closed, and the students go to school in Osmancƒ±k.

Sheep and goats are also raised. Barley, wheat, oats, and rye are the cereal crops produced, along with lentils, chickpeas, and white beans. There is also a tile factory in the village.

The population has decreased by some 3,000 people, who periodically return to visit their grandfathers and grandmothers. In late 2007, the village founded an association named \\"Tekmen Association of Regional Development, Solidarity, Cooperation, Education, Culture, Youth and Sport\\". The goals of the association are to develop the region and the community socially, economically, to protect the culture, to make the area a better place to live, to enhance solidarity and cooperation between natives and others, to assure people's right to live freely, to perform necessary social, cultural, economic, and sportive studies for youth, and to prepare projects based on these goals.  Upland Festival  Every year at the end of July, the Upland Festival is celebrated in Tekmen Village. Tekmenians come together at an upland of the village and enjoy entertainment for seven days. People come from all over Turkey. The festival hosts traditional wrestling, folk dances, Halay, local games, mini competitions, a football match, local or traditional foods, local singers, the musical instrument Saz, and other activities.

A past participant at a number of Hotel Carolina events, Tony Lucca likened it to \\"playing in the coolest sandbox ever\\", and explained: \\"To be able to hang with so many of my friends, musical companions, tour mates, fans, and new listeners in such an intimate, yet festive, setting makes me burst at the seams.\\" Ernie Halter, who also performed several years, called it \\"summer camp for big kids. ...I get to hang out at the beach and make music with all my friends, old and new\\". To further describe Hotel Carolina, Lucca said: \\"[It's] definitely a 'who's who' of indie singer-songwriters, as well as a 'who's who' of loyal supporters and music lovers.\\" As of January 2014, the Hotel Carolina Festival is on hiatus.

In addition to several Grammy Nominations and countless BMI Citations of Achievement, Cash has produced or written with artists such as Steven Curtis Chapman, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, Colin Bernard, Amy Grant, Bebo Norman, David Crowder Band, Bethany Dillon, Kari Jobe, Dave Barnes, Matt Wertz, Caedmon's Call, Casting Crowns, Annette Lee. He is a member of the band We the Kingdom.  Background  Cash also gains recognition as a songwriter for having co-written and produced \\"How Great is Our God\\", which earned him five Dove awards, including Song of the Year and Praise and Worship Song of the Year. Along with having co-written with Chris Tomlin, Mark Hall (Casting Crowns) and Amy Grant, Ed Cash has also received honors from the BMI Awards as the Christian Songwriter of the Year and Song of the Year.

Cash's involvement in a religious group called The Gathering International came under scrutiny when Christianity Today published an article investigating claims that the group is a cult. The article claimed that Cash's songwriting had helped fund the group and its leader, Wayne Jolley, and that Jolley had been given songwriting credit and royalties from Cash's portion of songs co-written with Christian music artist Chris Tomlin. Christianity Today later revealed that Cash had left the group and had severed connections with Jolley.

The Army had anticipated sending the upgraded weapons to deployed snipers in late 2010, but later expected fielding would happen in January 2011. The M2010 fires .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62√ó67mm) ammunition, which offers about 50 percent more effective range than the M24's 7.62√ó51mm NATO. This chambering to dimensionally larger cartridges is possible because the M24 was designed to use the \\"long action\\" bolt version of the Remington 700 receiver for cartridges up to in overall length.

The U.S. Army issued three XM2010s to snipers at the United States Army Sniper School on 18 January 2011 and began using the rifle in combat in Afghanistan in March 2011. Snipers in the field learned how use and maintain the new rifle during a three-day course. After the course, snipers had no difficulty hitting targets out to 1,000 meters from \\"ridgetop to ridgetop\\". In addition to the more powerful cartridge, the new optic improves the rifle's ability to sight a target quickly without calculations of range estimation.

She is most known for her book Migritude, based on her one-woman show of the same name, which was funded by the Ford Foundation. CNN characterizes Patel as an artist \\"who exemplifies globalization as a people- centered phenomenon of migration and exchange.\\"UWC Adriatic, 21 November 2009. She divides her time between Nairobi, Kenya, and Johannesburg, South Africa. She is a founding member of Kenyans For Peace, Truth and Justice, a civil society coalition that works for an equitable democracy in Kenya. Her book, Migritude, was published by Kaya Press in 2010.Kaya Press.  Biography  Patel's poetry, performance art, and essays are often centered on the themes of imperialism, migration, globalization, colonialism, women, and the African and South Asian diasporas. Patel is a founding member of Kenyans For Peace, Truth and Justice, a civil society coalition that works for an equitable democracy in Kenya. Patel noted in an interview with the Voice of America: \\"As an artist I move toward the forms that move me. I‚Äôve been a poet from childhood. When I migrated to the United States and discovered slam, it blew me away, so I immersed myself in it. When I began to write pieces that were too long and complex to slam, theater was the natural space to move into. Now I‚Äôve come full circle to writing again, making work‚Äîbooks, poems, political essays‚Äîthat migrate freely across continents and languages, independent of my physical body.\\"  Migritude  Patel is best known for her book Migritude, based on the 90-minute spoken-word theatre show of the same name. The name of the play is a term Patel coined herself. Derived from the words \\"migrant,\\" \\"attitude\\" and \\"negritude,\\" it refers to, in Patel's words, \\"a generation of migrants who don't feel the need to be silent to protect themselves.\\" The show is described on her website as using \\"her trousseau of saris, passed down by her mother, to unfold hidden histories of women's lives in the bootprint of Empire, from India to East Africa.\\" The work derives heavily from her own experiences. Migritude explores themes of heritage, war, liberation and migration. The show opened in the San Francisco Bay Area before embarking on a tour of Kenya, funded by the Ford Foundation. It was also presented in Vienna, Italy, Zanzibar, and on the closing night of the World Social Forum in Nairobi, in 2007.  Recognition  Patel has appeared on the BBC World Service, NPR and Al-Jazeera. Her work has been translated into 16 languages. Her political articles have appeared in The Africa Report, Pambazuka News, Mercury (South Africa), and a range of other publications. She guest-edited a special edition of Pambazuka News: \\"Kenya: One Year On\\", in February 2009. In 2012, she took part in Poetry Parnassus at the London Cultural Olympiad.\\"Shailja Patel\\", Poetry Foundation.  Controversy  On 6 August 2019, a Kenyan court exonerated and awarded Tony Mochama 9 million shillings after he sued Patel for defamation. Mochama had been accused of sexual assault by Patel and Professor Wambui Mwangi. Patel and Mwangi chose not to report the assault to police, due to fear that the Kenyan justice system could not be trusted to run an unbiased investigation. They instead made their case over social media. Mochama, who maintained his innocence, said that it was a racially motivated accusation, made with the intent to destroy his reputation. The Kenyan court also ordered the two women to apologise to Mochama through the court within 14 days. On 14 November 2019, responding to hostilities between Israel and Islamic Jihad militants operating in the Gaza Strip, Patel argued that due to its mandatory conscription laws \\"every single Israeli, from birth to death, [is] a de facto and de jure combatant\\" and therefore a legitimate military target.https://twitter.com/shailjapatel/status/1195007343391641603 Works *Migritude, Kaya Press, 2010, *Shilling Love, Fyrefly Press, 2002 *Dreaming in Gujurati, Fyrefly Press, 2000 ;Anthologies * TV and online video * Shailja Patel performs \\"The Cup Runneth Over\\" at the 2014 Split This Rock Poetry Festival.

He was born at Woking, Surrey and educated at Seaford College in Sussex. Jones was a pugnacious right-arm fast-medium bowler and a tail-end left-handed batsman. Sussex cricketer Jones made his Sussex debut in 1981 and in his fourth first-class match took the wickets of Graeme Wood, Trevor Chappell and Kim Hughes in a return of four for 68 against the Australians. On the strength of that performance he was brought into the England Youth team less than two weeks later to play in the third Youth \\"Test\\" against the Indian Youth team. In the winter of 1981‚Äì82, Jones was in South Africa where he made two appearances for the weak Border team in matches in the SAB Bowl competition, both of which were lost by an innings. There were few first-class games and few wickets for Jones in the 1982 and 1983 seasons, and he played in only one List A match in each of the two seasons (and was not used as a bowler in his one one-day match in 1982). But in the second half of the 1984 season, he began playing fairly regularly for the Sussex first team, and against Gloucestershire he took five second innings wickets for 29 runs: this would prove to be his best bowling performance for Sussex. In both 1985 and 1986, Jones played in around half of Sussex's first-class matches, but in a county which boasted Test players Imran Khan and Tony Pigott, as well as Garth Le Roux among its bowlers, his place was never assured, and he was injured for part of the 1986 season. He was a more regular player in 1986 in List A limited overs matches, and in the game against Nottinghamshire in May 1986 in the 40-over Sunday League competition, he took seven for 41 (out of eight Notts wickets that fell). These were not only the best List A figures of Jones's career, but they remain as of 2010 the best figures in a List A by a Sussex cricketer. Despite being awarded his Sussex county cap in 1986, he left the county at the end of the season and joined Somerset for 1987. Somerset player Jones joined the Somerset side at a point of maximum turmoil when the contracts of overseas players Viv Richards and Joel Garner had been terminated and Ian Botham had resigned. He immediately got a regular place in the first team and remained there for the next four seasons. In 1987, he was awarded his county cap and took 63 first-class wickets at an average of 28.57. His best return was a new career-best: seven for 85 in the match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge when, with three second innings wickets, he also took 10 wickets in a match for the only time in his career. Jones's record for Somerset over the next two seasons was consistent: 55 first-class wickets in 1988 and 71 in 1989, his highest aggregate. In 1988, in the match against Hampshire he toom the first seven first-innings wickets in 12 overs at a personal cost of 18 runs, and his eventual figures of seven for 30 would be the best of his first-class career. In 1989, with other Somerset bowlers injured, Eric Hill's notes for Wisden recorded Jones \\"playing in every match in spite of some injuries and occasional trouble with some authorities for his huge enthusiasm to get rid of batsmen\\". In all matches in 1989, he took 116 wickets. A hot summer and four-day cricket in 1990 contributed to Jones's average climbing to more than 36 runs per wicket, but he took more than 50 wickets again in first-class cricket. But at the end of the 1990 season he turned down a further contract from Somerset and moved back to Sussex for 1991. Back to Sussex Jones rejoined Sussex in 1991 and had similar success to what he had achieved with Somerset. He took 57 wickets in first-class matches and a further 31 in List A games. But he was restricted by injuries in both 1992 and 1993 and after a lack of success in 1993 he retired from the first-class game.

S√∂dermanland Runic Inscription 178 or S√∂ 178 is the Rundata catalog number for a Viking Age memorial runestone which is located at Gripsholm Castle, S√∂dermanland County, Sweden, which is in the historic province of S√∂dermanland. Description This runestone, which is made of sandstone and is 1.9 meters in height, consists of runic text carved on two serpents that bracket a Christian cross. The serpents have binding at their heads and near the end of their tails as if to bind them to the stone. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The stone was discovered in 1730 during excavation work near the castle and moved to its current location in 1926.The article Gripsholm on the site of the Swedish National Heritage Board, retrieved September 30, 2010. It is located near S√∂ 179 which is one of the Ingvar runestones. The runic text states that two brothers named Helgulfr and Eyjulfr raised the stone as a memorial to their brother Ketilmundr and a bridge in memory of their mother S√≥ma. The use of the word \\"stones\\" indicates that the memorial once consisted of a second stone, which has been lost. The Old Norse word for bridge could also mean an embankment or ford. The reference to bridge-building is fairly common in runestones during this time period. Some are Christian references related to passing the bridge into the afterlife. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges through a practice similar to the use of indulgences in return for the church's intercession for the soul of the departed. pp. 490-492. There are over one hundred examples of bridge runestones that are dated from the eleventh century, including inscriptions S√∂ 101 in Ramsundsberget, U 489 in Morby, and U 617 in Bro. The first word of the runic text hikkulfr has a double k-rune. Since double consonants are rare in Viking Age runic inscriptions, if the first rune is considered to have been a carving error for an l-rune, the word would be the unusual name Helgulfr. Another possibility is that the word is the name H√§ggulv. The mother's name S√≥ma is otherwise unknown from this period, and may be related to the Old Norse word somi meaning \\"glory\\" or \\"honor.\\" The inscription is signed by a runemaster named Br√∫ni, which is normalized as Brune, who was the brother of S√≥ma. The names of runemasters on many inscriptions are not located on the larger, main loop serpent with the main text, but are often on smaller serpents or adjacent to the main serpent. On S√∂ 178 Brune's name is on one of the two serpents with the main text, and that may be because he was related to the sponsors of the runestone. Brune also signed inscription S√∂ 55 in Bjudby, which is one of the England runestones, and the inscription S√∂ 177 from K√§rnbo is attributed to him based upon stylistic analysis. Inscription =Transliteration of the runes into Latin characters= :hikkulfr √ó auk √ó aulfr √ó √æai Ä √ó letu √ó raiisa √ó staina √ó ba√æa √ó at + bro√æur √ó sin √ó kitilmut * auk √ó bro √ó ifti Ä √ó somu √ó mo√æur √ó sina √ó ia √ó iruni √ó (h)iuk √ó bro√æi Ä + hina Ä √óProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for S√∂ 178. =Transcription into Old Norse= :H√¶lgulf Ä(?)/H√¶gulf Ä(?) ok √òyulf Ä √æ√¶i Ä letu r√¶isa st√¶ina ba√∞a at bro√∞ur sinn K√¶tilmund ok bro √¶fti Ä Somu, mo√∞ur sina.

Active in the Football League between 1964 and 1971, Corner made 160 appearances, scoring 32 goals. Early life Corner was born in the mining village of Horden, in County Durham, England, on 16 February 1943. He attended Horden Roman Catholic School where he played centre half and wing half for the football team, and was selected for East Durham Boys. Career Corner played youth football with Horden Colliery Welfare before he signed amateur forms at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1961. He spent 18 months with Wolves but was restricted to appearances in the Northern Intermediate League teams and returned to Horden Colliery Welfare. In August 1962, he again attracted a league club and he signed for Hull City on professional forms. Corner's debut for Hull came against Brentford in April 1964 when he scored twice in a 3‚Äì1 win at Griffin Park. However, he played only five first team games, scoring four goals, in five years, during which time Hull turned down an approach from Brian Clough at Hartlepools United, before Lincoln City signed Corner for a fee just short of ¬£4,000. He made his Lincoln debut on 7 October 1967 against Newport County to help his new side win 2‚Äì1. In April 1968, he scored a hat-trick against Bradford (Park Avenue) with all three goals coming from corners. His final game with Lincoln came on 18 January 1969 in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Brentford. The same month, Bradford City paid a fee also close to ¬£4,000 for Corner. At , he was the tallest player to have played for the club at the time. He made his debut in a Bradford derby against Park Avenue on 25 January 1969, and scored his first goal in the following game which finished in a 5‚Äì1 victory against Grimsby Town. He helped City to 21 games undefeated to earn them promotion in his first season at the club during which period he scored eight goals. In his second season, he tallied another five goals and also scored in a League Cup match against Sunderland. In his third season, he moved into defence, but still scored in all four of the club's FA Cup games. However, along with Bruce Bannister he was unable to agree personal terms with the club. He appealed to an independent tribunal which proved to be unsuccessful but left the club on a free transfer to join Park Avenue in March 1972. His last game for City was in December 1971, against Aston Villa. Corner had passed his coaching exams while with City, and started coaching at Park Avenue. In July 1973, he moved to South Shields. He played one season with South Shields, before he took over as player-manager at Wingate in the Wearside League. They came runners-up in the league and won a number of cup competitions under his guidance. He returned to Horden Colliery and scored their first goal in the Northern League following promotion from the Wearside League. He remained at the club on the committee. He went onto begin his own business and coached in schools. Later life and death After returning to the North-East, Corner lived in Horden, where he served on the committee at his former club Colliery Welfare, and later Peterlee. He was married to Jean, with whom he had two children Susan and Steven. Corner died in his native Horden on 19 February 2011, three days after his 68th birthday. His funeral was held at Horden Catholic Church, next to the Colliery Welfare's home ground.

In 1931, the firm moved its center of production to its current location in Obermeilen, Switzerland. * In 1918, SGO's main function was the manufacture of a carbonated lemonade called Si-Si. Beverage bottling, fruit processing, and the production of fruit \\"essences, fruit juices and syrups\\" comprised the remainder of the firm's services at that time. * Upon its relocation to Obermeilen in 1931, SGO ceased bottling lemonade and began to import lemons from Sicily for the use of their zests in the manufacturing of distillates. * By 1940, the firm began to focus more heavily on the \\"manufacture of beverage intermediate products, distillates, flavours, syrups as well as fruit bases\\" * In 1950, SGO developed and manufactured new fruit bases for yoghurts.\\" SGO was the first company to develop a fruit base specifically to flavor yogurt. This work was transferred in 1956 to their subsidiary company DSF, based in Constance, Germany, a company that was founded by SGO for this purpose; six years later, the same information was sold to SIAS, based in Paris, France. * Starting in 1962, new facilities were created to suit SGO's growing production, including a new building for fruit processing (1962), a new refrigeration plant (1972), hostel-style accommodations for employees (1972),the extension of distillation and fruit confits (1976), and a new building with cooling and refrigeration plants, shipping department and offices (1990). * In 1970, SGO began producing candied fruit and fruit toppings, the only product SGO makes that produced for and sold directly to consumers. * SGO registered their trademark for fruit products in the food industry in 1981. * In 1993, SGO celebrated its 75th anniversary. * In 2003, SGO began operating a new filling center. * By 2004, roughly 60% of SGO sales and production was in the form of raw fruit materials for the dairy industry, more specifically, for fruit bases in yogurt and yogurt drinks. SGO also offered a variety of fruit preparations, candied fruits, jams, fruit fillings, ice cream bases, syrups, toppings, and premium fruit distillates for all areas of the food industry. * In 2009, SGO stopped the production of both syrups in glass bottles and of candied fruits. =Acquisitions, partnerships, and development = * In 1956, SGO transferred their manufacture of fruit preparations to their German subsidiary company DSF, Deutsch-Schweizerische Fr√ºchteverarbeitung GmbH; in 1962, SGO passed the manufacturing to the French firm SIAS, Soci√©t√© Industrielle et Agricole de la Somme. SIAS was taken over by the food production company Agrana in 2004; In 2005, Agrana also took over DSF. * In 1990, SGO took over the Dregelyvar fruit processing plan in Dr√©gelypal√°nk, Hungary. Dregelyvar has subsequently grown into the biggest fruit additive supplier to Hungarian dairies. In 2000, however, the SGO sold Dregelyvar to the German company Zentis, a manufacturer of fruit products and marzipan in Germany. * In June 2004, Urs E. Dietschi was interviewed in the magazine Schweizerische Lebensmittel Industrie, about SGO, its products, and its particularly innovative character as part of the food industry. The article is entitled \\"Obermeilen ‚Äì aus der Welt der Fr√ºchte und Aromen,\\" or, \\"Obermeilen - From the world of fruits and flavors.\\" * In 2006, SGO acquired Promena AG as a new distribution and marketing partner for Obermeilen topping, Obermeilen syrup and Cusenier syrup within Switzerland.\\" * In March 2010, SGO was in the news due to a freak accident when a factory worker set off a brief, isolated, but violent explosion, when a highly flammable liquid, isopentane, escaped while he was filling a solvent distillation unit. When combined with oxygen, the isopentane created a flame, that was quickly extinguished. One worker suffered significant burn injuries, and two others suffered smoke inhalation. Due to uncertainty over whether or not there would be further explosions, 80 members of the local fire services were called to the scene. =Certifications= * In 1994, SGO received ISO 9001 certification \\"for fruit preparations and flavours.\\" * In 2003, SGO received certification for ISO 9001:200. * SGO received certification from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) by the Swiss Association for Quality Management and Systems (SQS) for flavours, fruit preparations and concentrated juices\\" in 2005. * SGO also produces certified organic products which follow the guidelines of both Bio Suisse and EU organic. * SGO is certified to make Kosher products, and is recognized by the kosher division of the Orthodox Union. * SGO is also certified to provide raw material for halal products. Management SGO is a family-run firm. Emil Dietschi took over leadership upon SGO's move to Obermeilen from Maennedorf in 1931, and remained at the head of the company until 1972. Upon the death of Emil Dietschi, his son, Urs E. Dietschi, took over, and acted as CEO for 25 years, from 1972‚Äì2007, until his retirement. In 2007, Bruno Witschi took on the position of CEO, however Urs E. Dietschi still acts as President and Chairman of the company. Environmental record SGO 's production processes are assessed, and improved, in the interest of both reducing cost and reducing effects on the environment. Waste disposal is also analyzed in this manner. The company has made a goal of improving energy efficiency by at least 1.5% annually both for environmental concerns and to reduce costs. SGO is a member of the Lake Zurich Energy Model Group and the International Energy Agency, and has also been a member of the Energie-Agentur der Wirtschaft, the Energy Agency for the Economy, since 1997. Another goal of SGO is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through changes to both processes and infrastructure. The company disposes of biological wastes from organic production through a professional disposal company. When possible, the biological gases, produced through fermentation, are upgraded to natural gas quality, to feed it into the network and to offer it as fuel for vehicles at petrol stations.

In island volcanic arcs it consists of back-arc basins of oceanic crust with abyssal depths, which may be separated by remnant arcs, similar to island arcs. In continental arcs the back-arc region is part of continental platform, either dry land (subaerial) or forming shallow marine basins. Formation Back-arc deformation is a product of subduction at convergent plate tectonic boundaries. It initiates and evolves behind the volcanic arc on the overriding plate of a subduction zone. The stresses responsible for the deformation in this region of a subduction zone result from a combination of processes. The absolute motion of the upper plate as it moves towards or away from the trench strongly contributes to deformation in the back-arc region. Since the downgoing slab is partly anchored in the viscous layers of the mantle, and therefore its lateral movement is significantly slower than the surface plate, then any motion of the overriding plate will cause extensional or compressional stress in the back-arc region depending on the direction of motion. In addition, mantle convection in the upper mantle wedge caused by the downward movement of the subducted slab causes stress in the upper plate and the high heat flow that characterizes back-arcs. The pulling effect of the slab as it goes down into the mantle causes a rollback motion of the trench, which also applies stress on the back- arc region of the upper plate. However, this last process has less of an impact on deformation compared to upper plate motion. Back-arcs can form on either oceanic crust or continental crust. In the case of oceanic crust, most back-arc regions are subjected to tensional stresses and thus develop a spreading center where new oceanic crust is formed. The composition of this new crust is similar to MORB, although it contains higher amounts of water. Back-arc extension vs. compression The back-arc deformation may be either extensional or compressional. The overriding plate will shorten when its motion is directed towards the trench, resulting in a compression of the back- arc region. This type of deformation is associated with a shallow dipping subducted slab. Inversely, an overriding plate moving away from the trench will result in extension, and a back-arc basin will form. This extensional deformation is associated with a steeply dipping slab. The extreme cases of these two types of back-arc deformation can be found in Chile and at the Marianas arc. The shallow dipping slab subducting beneath Chile at an angle of about 10‚Äì15¬∞ causes a compressional stress on the back-arc region behind the Andes. On the other extreme, the slab going down into the mantle at the Marianas subduction zone is so steep it is nearly vertical. This is the perfect example of an oceanic back-arc basin experiencing extensional forces. The Oriente in Ecuador (the eastern part of the country covered by rainforest) is also a good example of an extensional back-arc basin, this time in a continental setting. The continental crust in this area east of the Andes has been stretched out and covered by layers of sediments.

He is documented as Count of Sponheim from 1044 and served as margrave of the Hungarian March in 1045/46 and as count in the Puster Valley and the Lavant Valley from 1048 until his death. Descendance Ruins of Sponheim Castle, 19th century engraving Siegfried was born at Sponheim Castle in Rhenish Franconia.Gruden, J. (1910). p. 171.Vengust, M. (2008). p. 23. Likewise Siegfried had a family relationship of unknown degree with Count Stephan I of Sponheim (d. ca. 1080), patriarch of the Rhenish branch of the Sponheim dynasty, which survives as the present-day Princes of Sayn-Wittgenstein. Life In 1035 the Salian emperor Conrad II marched against the rebellious Duke Adalbero of Carinthia. In his attendance was Count Siegfried as his close companion, who thus arrived from Rhenish Franconia in the southeastern estates of the German kingdom. Adalbero was deposed and succeeded by the Salian duke Conrad the Younger in 1036. Siegfried married Richgard, the heiress of Count Engelbert IV in the Puster Valley from the Carinthian family of the Sieghardinger and Aribonids.Hauptmann, L (1999). p. 78. Through the marriage with Richgard, he obtained large possessions in Tyrol and also in Carinthia, for example the Lavant Valley (in modern Austria)Kos, M.(1933). p. 133. and probably also La≈°ko and some other parts in the March of Carniola (in modern Slovenia) like the territories around Ljubljana.Hauptmann, L. (1999). pp. 78, 91. In the year 1044 he documents as ruling Count at Sponheim. In 1045 King Henry III of Germany granted Siegfried the territory of the Hungarian March at the eastern frontier of the March of Austria as a fiefdom. However, he kept and managed this land only for a short period. The Hungarian March was finally dissolved and incorporated under the rule of the Babenberg margrave Ernest of Austria from 1055. In 1048 Siegfried documents as a Gaugraf in the Tyrolean Puster Valley and in the Carinthian Lavant Valley; he must therefore have already succeeded to his father-in-law Count Engelbert IV as heir to this territory by then. He overtook likewise the possessions of his father-in-law in the Duchy of Bavaria. Besides he soon held the office of a Vogt (reeve) in the bishoprics of Brixen and Salzburg. Siegfried received likewise possessions in Lower Carinthia and in eastern Upper Bavaria. In 1064 Siegfried joined the pilgrimage of Archbishop Siegfried I of Mainz to Jerusalem. On his way back, one year later, he died on the transit through Bulgaria.Dotzauer, W. (2001). p. 151. There he was also buried, before his widow Richgard released the corpse and let him be buried in the parish church of Sankt Paul im Lavanttal he had planned and constructed. In the year 1909 the Siegfriedstrasse in the Floridsdorf district of Vienna was named after him. Issue From Siegfried's marriage with Richgard Countess of Lavant Valley several children were born: * Engelbert I (d. 1096), succeeded his father as Count of Sponheim and Gaugraf in the Puster Valley and Lavant Valley, appointed Margrave of Istria in 1090; married Hadwig, possibly a daughter of the Billung duke Bernard II of Saxony * Siegfried (d. 1070), married ?, supposedly not of equal birth, since there is no direct relationship of the descendants to further Sponheim counts * Hartwig (d. 1102), Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1079 * Hermann (d. 1118), Burgrave of Magdeburg from 1080 References Literature * Dotzauer, Winfried: Geschichte des Nahe-Hunsr√ºck-Raumes von den Anf√§ngen bis zur Franz√∂sischen Revolution.

Born in Kosovo, he was a descendant of the Byzantine Angelos family that had left Thessaly in 1394. As a child, he was given to the Ottomans according to the dev≈üirme system and raised as a Muslim in Edirne. A capable soldier, he was married to a daughter of Sultan Mehmed II. After distinguishing himself at the Siege of Belgrade (1456), he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding Zaganos Pasha. Throughout his tenure, he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns. Origin and early life After the Ottoman conquest of Thessaly in 1394, the ruling Angeloi \\"Mahmud Pasha's Pseudonym According to all indications, the pseudonym (mahlas) used by Mahmud Pasha when writing poetry was Adni (the Eden-like) and this is indicated by most sources, most particularly Asik Celebi and Sehi Beg, who ...\\" \\"With the possible exception of the grand vizier Mahmud Pasha, who under the pseudonym of Adni wrote Persian and Ottoman Turkish rhymes, the period offers no further poets of above-average quality. Among the poets it seems fitting to mention as ...\\" Philanthropenoi family took refuge. The grandchildren of either Alexios or Manuel were Mahmud Pasha and his brother Mihailo Anƒëeloviƒá. He was partially Albanian and related to the Albanian noblemen Alessio and Peter Spani through Alexios III Angelos, who was possibly their ancestor Although the contemporary Byzantine sources and Ibn Kemal calls him Serbian, some late Ottoman sources call him Croatian or Albanian. It is estimated that Angeloviƒá was born in the early 1420s. Most historians accept that Angeloviƒá was born in Novo Brdo in the Serbian Despotate, and that his father Mihailos was the son of either Alexios Angelos Philanthropenos or his son/nephew/brother Manuel, rulers of Thessaly. T. Stavrides views it more probable that Manuel was his grandfather. The only information on his father is that he lived in Serbia in the 1420s. His mother's ancestry is the matter of debate. Chalkokondyles (1430‚Äì1470) called her Serbian, Kritoboulos (1410‚Äì1470), Greek, while there are various theories on her noble ancestry. Angeloviƒá had a brother, Mihailo Anƒëeloviƒá, later a prominent Serbian statesman. According to Tahsin Yazici / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, Angeloviƒá was \\"born to a Greek or Serbian family\\". Chalkokondyles mentions that Angeloviƒá was captured by Ottoman horsemen while traveling with his mother from Novo Brdo to Smederevo (the Serbian capital), and taken to the Ottoman court. It is assumed that this took place in 1427, when the Ottomans attacked Serbia. Furthermore, it is unconcluded whether he was captured according to the dev≈üirme(practice, the regular practice of taking children certain noble families whose Ottomans have taken lands and making these children high rankings officials) or as a prisoner of war. Ta≈ük√∂pr√ºzade (d. 1560) and A≈üƒ±k √áelebi (1520‚Äì1572) name two other boys led with Angeloviƒá on horseback to Edirne, Molla Iyas and Mevlana Abd√ºlkerim, the latter which reached the rank of kadƒ±asker (chief judge) and ≈üeyh√ºlislam (Islamic scholar). Upon conversion to Islam, he received the name Mahmud. Little is known about his activities before 1453. According to T. Stavrides, Angeloviƒá and his companions were educated in the palace, probably as i√ßoƒülan, and Mahmud then entered service in the Ender√ªn, later serving prince Mehmed, the future sultan. Sources do not agree on which posts he held at the palace. Life Remains of Mahmud Pasha hamam at Lower Town of Golubac Fortress. Mahmud Pasha was a capable soldier. After distinguishing himself at the Siege of Belgrade (1456), he was raised to the position of Grand Vizier as a reward, succeeding Zaganos Pasha. Throughout his tenure he led armies or accompanied Mehmed II on his own campaigns. In 1458, the Serbian Despot Lazar Brankoviƒá died. Mahmud's brother Mihailo became member of a collective regency, but he was soon deposed by the anti-Ottoman and pro-Hungarian faction in the Serbian court. In reaction, Mahmud attacked and seized Smederevo Fortress, although the citadel held out, and seized some additional strongholds in its vicinity. Threatened by a possible Hungarian intervention however he was forced to withdraw south and join the forces of Sultan Mehmed II at Skopje. In 1461, he accompanied Mehmed in his campaign against the Empire of Trebizond, the last surviving fragment of the Byzantine Empire. Mahmud negotiated the surrender of the city of Trebizond with the protovestiarios, the scholar George Amiroutzes, who was also his cousin. In 1463, Mahmud led the invasion and conquest of the Kingdom of Bosnia, even though a peace treaty between Bosnia and the Ottomans had just been renewed. He captured the Bosnian king, Stephen Toma≈°eviƒá, at Kljuƒç, and obtained from him the cession of the country to the Empire. Angeloviƒá accompanied Mehmed II when he attacked Albania Veneta in the summer of 1467, and ravaged the lands. For 15 days he pursued Skanderbeg, who was a Venetian ally at the time, but failed to find him, as Skanderbeg retreated into the mountains and then succeeded in fleeing to the coast. According to Tursun Beg and Ibn Kemal, Angeloviƒá swam over Bojana, attacked Venetian-controlled Scutari, and plundered the surrounding area. Mahmud was dismissed in 1468 due to the machinations of his successor, Rum Mehmed Pasha, ostensibly due to irregularities regarding the resettlement of the Karamanids in Constantinople following the conquest of Karaman earlier in that year. He was reinstated in 1472, but his relations with the Sultan were now strained. He was dismissed and executed in 1474, allegedly because of Mehmed's son, prince Mustafa. Mahmud had been at loggerheads with Mustafa after divorcing his second wife for spending a night in the same house as Mustafa during Mahmud's absence on campaign in 1473. Mustafa's death later in 1474 was even attributed by later accounts to poisoning by Mahmud. Literary output Mahmud Pasha wrote works in Persian and Turkish with \\"Adni\\" as his nom de plume. The divan he composed includes 45 ghazals and 21 mofrads in Persian, as well as \\"some rather successful naziras on the ghazals of Zahir Faryabi and Hafez\\". Tahsin Yazici / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica adds that Mahmud Pasha \\"also wrote a number of official letters in Persian\\". Family He married Sel√ßuk Hatun, daughter of Zaganos Pasha, by his wife Sitti Nefise Hatun, and had a son named Ali Bey and a daughter named Hatice Hatun.

He played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball, and , Washington Senators and Minnesota Twins. Listed at , 175 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Jacobs attended Boardman High School and graduated from Ohio University. He was signed as a bonus baby non-drafted free agent by the Washington Senators in 1959, being immediately allocated to Class-D Sanford Greyhounds. In his professional debut, Jacobs led his team with a .313 batting average and a 448 slugging percentage, gaining a promotion to the Class-A Charlotte Hornets the next year. Jacobs spent most of 1960 with Charlotte before joining the Senators in late September, appearing in two games as a pinch hitter and four as a pinch runner. He ascended to Triple-A in 1961, and split the season between the Syracuse Chiefs and Indianapolis Indians before returning to the majors in September for four games with the Minnesota Twins (the Senators had moved to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota during the offseason). He played two more years in the minors, for the Vancouver Mounties in 1962 and Charlotte again in 1963. In his brief majors career, Jacobs was a .200 hitter (2-for-10) and scored two runs in 10 games. In five minor league seasons, he posted a .277 average in 545 games. Following his baseball career, Jacobs spent the next 25 years as an insurance salesman for Ohio National Life and attained numerous awards such as a recurrent member of the Million Dollar Round Table. While playing at Indianapolis, he met Janice Oliver, a former Miss Indiana. They were married in 1962 and had four children and eight grandchildren. He was also heavily involved with the YMCA in his native Youngstown, and was a big supporter and trainer for Sports World Ministries. Jacobs died in Palmetto, Florida where he lived, at the age of 73 from dementia.

It is named after the Vladimirovskoye deposit in Russia, where it was discovered in the 1950s. Vladimirite is monoclinic- prismatic, which means crystallographically, it contains three axes of unequal length and the angles between two of the axes are 90 degrees, and one is less than 90 degrees. It belongs to the space group P21/c. The mineral also has an orthorhombic polytype. In terms of its optical properties, vladimirite is anisotropic which means the velocity of light varies depending on direction through the mineral. Relief is a diagnostic characteristic of a mineral in plane polarized light that refers to the various ways different minerals \\"stand out\\". Vladimirite's calculated relief is 1.65-1.661, which is moderate. It is colorless in plane polarized light, and it is weakly pleochroic. Pleochroism is the variety of colors under plane polarized light displayed by crystals at various angles. Occurrence Vladimirite was first described in 1953 at two deposits in Russia, the Khovu-Aksy nickel-cobalt deposit, Tuva Republic, and the Vladimirovskoye cobalt deposit, Altai Mountains, Altaiskii Krai, Siberia. It is a secondary mineral in the oxidized zone of arsenic- bearing ore deposits. It occurs with picropharmacolite, erythrite and aragonite. It has been reported from the Richelsdorf Mountains, Hesse, Germany; the Bou Azzer district, Morocco and the Mohawk mine, Keweenaw County, Michigan.

In ancient times, the Jingshan Mountains were at the heart of the Zhou Dynasty (1046-256 BCE) vassal State of Chu.Sima Qian, Records of the Grand Historian See also * Shennongjia Massif - to the west * Wudang Mountains - to the northwest References External links *Jingshan Sen Forest Park Mountain ranges of Hubei ","title":"Jing Mountains"},{"id":"29010906","title":"List of Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks number ones of 1999"},{"id":"29010930","text":"Xu Ling () (507-583) was the compiler and editor of the famous poetry anthology New Songs from the Jade Terracehttp://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Poetry/yutaixinyong.html Theobald, Ulrich.

He is an Egyptian artist and photographer. Youssef Nabil began his photography career in 1992 by staging tableaux in which his subjects acted out melodramas recalling film stills from the golden age of Egyptian cinema. Later in the 1990s, while working as a photographers' assistant in studios in New York and Paris, he began photographing artists and friends, producing both formal portraits as well as placing his subjects in the realms of dreams and sleep, on the edge of awareness, far from their daylight selves. On his return to Egypt in 1999 he further developed his hand-painted photography, with portraits of writers, singers and film stars of the Arab world. Since returning to Paris and New York in 2003, he started producing self-portraits that reflect his dislocated life away from Egypt. This series that has evolved over the years is characterised by liminal scenes in which he lingers between worldly realities and serene dreams, loneliness and fears of death. Nabil's distinctive technique of hand-coloring silver gelatin prints removes the blemishes of reality. Nabil disrupts prevalent notions of color photography and painting, as well as assumptions about the aesthetic sensibilities associated with art and those identified with popular culture. His hand-colouring evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia and allows his photographs to flicker between our time and another era. Nabil shoots intricately arranged black-and-white photographs, primarily portraits, which he then meticulously hand-colors in a rich and varied palette, employing a technique based on the color-tinting of old Egyptian portrait studios. ‚ÄúThe technique I got from Egypt, but the colors I got from personal experience,‚Äù he has said. Background Born in Cairo, Egypt, Nabil started his photography career in 1992, shortly before meeting the American photographer David LaChapelle in Cairo, with whom he worked in New York in 1993. In 1997, Nabil worked in Paris with the Peruvian fashion photographer Mario Testino till late 1998. In 1999, Youssef Nabil had his first solo exhibition in Cairo. Through the years he remained a close friend with the Egyptian-Armenian studio portrait photographer Van Leo (Leon Boyadjian, 1921‚Äì2001), who encouraged Nabil to leave to the West. In 2003, Youssef Nabil was awarded the Seydou Keita Prize in the Biennial of African Photography in Bamako. In 2001, while visiting Cairo, British artist Tracey Emin discovered Nabil's work and later nominated him as a future top artist in Harper's article Tomorrow People. Nabil left Egypt in 2003 for an artist residency at the Cit√© internationale des arts in Paris. In 2006, he moved to live and work in New York. Many have been subject to Nabil's lens and distinctive technique of hand-colouring gelatin silver prints, including artists Tracey Emin, Gilbert and George, Nan Goldin, Marina Abramoviƒá, Louise Bourgeois, and Shirin Neshat; singers Alicia Keys, Sting (musician), and Natacha Atlas; actors Robert De Niro, Omar Sharif, Faten Hamama, Rossy de Palma, Charlotte Rampling, Isabelle Huppert, and Catherine Deneuve. In 2010, Nabil wrote, produced and directed his first film You Never Left, an 8-minute short film with actors Fanny Ardant and Tahar Rahim. It is set in an allegorical place that is a metaphor of a lost Egypt, sketching an intimate and solemn parallel between exile and death. This video in which he reverently and inventively revisits the characteristics of Egyptian cinema‚Äôs golden age, with its movie stars and Technicolor film stock, he reconnects with the source and inspiration of his photographic imagery with which it shares the same personal, diaristic quality. In 2015, Nabil produced his second video, I Saved My Belly Dancer, with actors Salma Hayek and Tahar Rahim, a narration around his fascination with the tradition of belly dancers and the disappearance of the art form that is unique to the Middle East. The 12-minute video also explores shifting perceptions of women in the Arab world and the tensions between the amplified sexualisation of their bodies and the continued repression of women in modern Arab society. Nabil's work has been presented on numerous international solo and group exhibitions, at venues including the British Museum, London; Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, LACMA, MMK Museum f√ºr Modern Kunst, Frankfurt, MASP Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo, IVAM Institut Valenci√† d'Art Modern, Valencia, Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver, La Maison Rouge, Paris, Centro de la Imagen, Mexico City; North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh; BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Newcastle, MACBA Centre de Cultura Contempor√°nea de Barcelona, Gem√§ldegalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Museum of Photography, Thessaloniki, Victoria & Albert Museum, London, Biennale of the Visual Arts of Santa Cruz, Kunstmuseum, Bonn, Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C, Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris; Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah; Kunstmuseum, Bonn; The Third Line, Dubai;; Galerist, Istanbul; Nathalie Obadia gallery, Paris; Yossi Milo gallery, New York; Centro Andaluz de Arte Contempor√°neo, Sevilla; Aperture Foundation, New York, Villa Medici, Rome and Palazzo Grassi, Venice.

Stone lines and stone zones are known to occur in soils, paleosols (buried soils), and in non-soil geologic-stratigraphic sequences. Where present in stratigraphic sequences, if the units were deposited by running water, the stones are usually imbricated (individual stones are lapped, or leaning, upon one another in the direction of water flow). This is strong evidence that such stone lines are geogenic. On the other hand, a stone line that is present in a soil or a paleosol is invariable non-imbricated and follows (mimics) the surface topography of the soil, or the paleosurface of a paleosol. This is strong evidence that such stone lines are pedogenic, and produced by soil forming processes.

Dimbeswar and Ajaleetora Neog were blessed with seven children. He died in Assam Medical College after a brief period of illness in 1966. Born in a typical Assamese village Kamarfadia of Sibsagar, Assam, Dimbeswar Neog spent his childhood days amidst the colourful glee of nature. His father was Manik Chandra Neog and mother Chandraprabha Neog. He had two brothers - noted scholar Maheswar Neog and Mukheswar Neog. While at Cotton College, he came into contact with poets like Chandrakumar Agarwalla. He was close to personalities like Chandradhar Baruah, Mitradev Mahanta, Bani Kanta Kakoti and Suniti Kumar Chatterji. Neog was married to Ajaleetora Neog, daughter of Benudhar Rajkhowa from Dibrugarh. The couple was later on blessed with seven children, three sons and four daughters. They then moved to their residence \\"Xuwoni Poja\\" (Beauty Cot) in Torajan, Jorhat. The children were Maniki Madhuri (Keteki), Basanta Mongal (Chandan), Amiya Madhuri (Moloya), Sapon Madhuri (Nizara), Jeewan Madhuri (Jonaki), Sarat Mongal (Nandan) and Hemanta Mongal (Bondon). Literary scholarship Neog's contributions to the history of Assamese literature and language is impeccable. He had authored around 100 books. His works ranged from story, verses, novel, drama, history of literature and criticism to folk-literature. Neog is best known as a critic of Assamese literature. According to the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, two of Neog's works on Assamese literature \\"made significant contribution to the development of critical assessment in Assamese literature on an academic plane.\\" Neog's approach to literary criticism has, however, been criticized as being \\"not entirely free of personal prejudice\\" and \\"occasionally vitiated by his biased analysis.\\" In 1965, Dimbeswar Neog presided over the 32nd session of Asom Sahitya Sabha in Nalbari.  Memorial committee  A memorial committee entitled 'Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha' (Dimbeswar Neog Memorial Committee) in honour of Dimbeswar Neog was formed at his residence in the year 1969 under the aegis of his eldest son Late Basanta Mangal Neog. Gradually, the committee was officially constituted with Dr.Bhupen RoyChodhury as its first secretary and the memorial meetings began to be organized on a public domain for the greater interest of the people. Since then, the committee has been annually organizing the memorial meetings on the 12 November, which is Neog's death anniversary. Prominent scholars and literary geniuses of the state have graced this yearly occasion from time to time as chief speakers, speaking about his invaluable contribution to Assamese literature as well as by being present as distinguished guests. Recitation of his poems, songs penned by him are also performed in these meetings as an ode to him. In the year 1992, 'Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha' has been renamed to 'Dimbeswar Neog-Aajaleetara Neog Xuworoni Saurabh Samiti' to commemorate his better-half, Ajaleetara Neog, who had been closely associated with children's literature herself. The committee has been conducting art competitions among children from time to time in the memory of Ajaleetara Neog as well as Dimbeswar Neog. In order to mark the glorious 45 years of this memorial committee, a special presentation has been screened at the yearly memorial meeting of 2014.

Father Tiago Soares da Costa is the Parish Priest and ministers to more than 21,000 people living within his parish. The number of people attending Mass on the weekends has grown immensely, hence the need for a new church. Approximately 1,500 people fit inside the church and on a Sunday morning there are more than 1,000 people standing outside the church building. There is no sound system. The parish facilitates many programs with and for their people: FOSKA ‚Äì a youth and young adult's formation program, adult prayer groups, ministry for the sick, and care for those suffering from poverty and hunger. The church building of St Theresina's is extremely dilapidated and shows signs of the years of war and struggle for independence. The piles of rocks surrounding St Theresina's are to be part of a new church building. They have been brought there by families each week, when they attend Mass. Their hope is that these rocks will contribute to the foundations of the new church. There are approximately 15 piles of stones which have been moved by the faithful. In addition, Fr. Tiago has started a ‚Äòten cent fund‚Äô where each family willingly contributes 10c each week. The money collected will be used for the rebuilding of their church.

In 1912, Jesse Knight purchased 1,600 acres of coal land and began developing a mine and a company town. Knight named the town Storrs, after the mine superintendent. The name of the town was changed to Spring Canyon in 1924. 1,000 tons of coal per day were mined from 1924 to 1943, and during World War II, coal production peaked at 2,000 tons of coal per day. By 1946, the need for coal diminished, and people began to leave. By 1969, Spring Canyon was abandoned. History Prior to the establishment of Spring Canyon, residents in Helper mined coal from a small opening on the side of the mountain. In 1895, Teancum Pratt constructed a wagon road in order to make coal transportation easier. In 1912, Jesse Knight purchased 1,600 acres of land west of Helper, organized the Spring Canyon Coal Company, and constructed sixty homes. Knight also constructed a railroad in 1913 to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad line in Helper. Knight named the new town Storrs, after the mine superintendent George Storrs. Because Knight was a Mormon, he banned saloons and gambling houses from being constructed in the town. In 1914, a schoolhouse and a church were constructed for the townspeople, who were mostly members of the LDS Church. By the end of 1914, 1,000 tons of coal per day were being shipped. By 1924, Storrs had 1,000 residents, a hotel, a heated swimming pool, and well-built houses, offices, and stores. At this time, George Storrs was charged with mail fraud, and the town's name was officially changed to Spring Canyon. From 1924 to 1943, 1,000 tons of coal per day were mined, and in 1940, the Spring Canyon mine was ranked as the fourth largest coal producer in Utah. During World War II, 2,000 tons of coal per day were being mined. By 1946, the Spring Canyon mine had transported and mined eleven million tons of coal, and by 1948, the Spring Canyon Coal Company was also operating the mines in Standardville and Royal. However, the need for coal began to diminish, and by 1954, only a small group of miners remained in Spring Canyon. The mine closed in 1969 due to low production and increasingly high costs. Only three families were living in Spring Canyon in 1969, and by the end of the year, Spring Canyon was abandoned. When the mine first closed in 1969 and the town's residents relocated, few buildings were removed. The Spring Canyon Hotel, most of the homes, and the mine offices were left. However, in 1975, every building in Spring Canyon's business district was demolished. The railroad trestle and the ruins of the residential section of town are the only remnants of the former coal mining town.

Biographical sketch Xiong Yi lived at the time of King Cheng of Zhou (reigned 1042‚Äì1021 BC) who wished to honor the most loyal officials of his predecessors King Wu of Zhou and King Wen of Zhou. The king summoned a meeting with Xiong Yi and the other vassal lords at Qiyang () (northeast of modern-day Qishan County, Shaanxi Province) where Xiong Yi swore allegiance to the King and became keeper of the Maojue () in the order of precedence. Along with the Xianbei clan leader he was also appointed joint guardian of the ritual torch (). At the same meeting, as a result of his ancestors‚Äô loyal service to the former kings of Zhou, Xiong Yi received a grant of land around Danyang () (modern day Xichuan County, Henan Province) where he built the first capital of Chu. He then began the arduous task of clearing the thorny undergrowth from the foothills of the Jingshan Mountains so that his people could build Chu and make sacrifices to the Zhou king.

He moved to Vancouver, Washington, with his family in 1972 and graduated from Evergreen High School in 1978. While there he studied drama for three years under teacher Jon Kerr. In college he first studied under Dr. George L. Meshke and in 1981, he received his A.A. degree from Shoreline Community College in Seattle, Washington. While in Seattle he studied under Morry Hendrickson and Willy Clarke. =Early career= Harrel made his professional stage debut on his 21st birthday in 1981 at Seattle's Brass Ring Theatre as Officer O'Hara in Joseph Kesselring's macabre comedy, Arsenic and Old Lace.\\"'Arsenic and Old Lace' hasn't lost its funny kick\\" by Wayne Johnson, The Seattle Times, April 21, 1981 In 1985, he started producing videos with his own Orthicon Ghost Productions.https://www.youtube.com/user/orthiconghost Harrel made his stage debut in Portland, Oregon, playing Carl Cooper in Douglas Gower's play Daddies at the Blue Room for Portland Civic Theatre in December 1985. \\"Harrel does a particularly good job of portraying a backwoods hippie-religious fanatic without making Carl seem ridiculous‚Äîindeed, he gives Carl surprising dimension.\\"\\"Actors' efforts still can't save 'Daddies'\\" by Bob Hicks, The Oregonian, December 10, 1985 He also met two longtime collaborators: director Douglas Mouw and Cathy J. Lewis. In 1986, he co-founded, with Cathy J. Lewis, a participatory theatre company called The Jupiter Players, which toured around the Portland area until 1988 and for which he wrote four plays.\\"Rose Farm guests help solve tortuous theatrical murder\\" by Connie Potter, The Oregonian, October 1986 One of these plays was an early version of Trial By Error, a courtroom comedy that crossed Perry Mason with Citizen Kane. It was performed in an actual courtroom at the Clackamas County Courthouse in Oregon City. =Jack controversy= During the fall and winter of 1988, Harrel's new play, Jack‚Äîa trauma from hell in seven scenes, was produced by Playback Theatre with him directing. An updated tale based on Jack The Ripper, it was a modest success. The play was produced as a movie, which was scheduled to have its premiere as a cablecast on Multnomah County public-access television cable TV on May 26, 1989. The 70-minute video didn't even make it through one cablecast when the operators stopped the tape before the end because three viewers called to complain. The story featured male nudity and one of the comments claimed that Multnomah Cable Access was showing pornography and obscene language.personal letter from MCA Community Relations Coordinator Barbara Rutherford to Rod Harrel, June 5, 1989 The legal department at M.C.A. felt that Jack probably violated Oregon's very liberal obscenity laws. Harrel took his case to the press and in short order, Peter Farrell, the Oregonian's television critic, penned a column. \\"Most of the nudity occurs in connection with discussion about sexual politics and values, which would seem to protect it from even fairly narrow views on obscenity,\\" he wrote. \\"'I think people were upset by the male nudity,' said Harrel. \\"'Frontal male nudity is not seen very often.'\\"Access cable finally meets naked truth, by Peter Farrell, The Oregonian, June 12, 1989 Jack then was shown on M.C.A. and eventually on Portland Cable Access and was shown as a benefit for the newly formed Stark Raving Theatre. =Later career= In 1988, while working in the box office for New Rose Theatre, Harrel met E. J. Westlake. Along with Robin Suttles, they co-founded Stark Raving Theatre, which opened in March 1989 at a basement space in the Bull Ring Restaurant in northwest Portland.\\"'Don Juan' debuts at Top of the Cosmo\\" by Bob Hicks, The Oregonian, March 28, 1989 All three co- founders were playwrights and from the beginning SRT was a haven for producing new works. Both Harrel, the artistic director, and Westlake, the managing director, had shows produced the first season. As an actor, Harrel appeared in such plays as his own, Trial By Error, Cold Hands written by Paul Bernstein and Beidermann and the Firebugs. Harrel's favorite role during this time was as Bill Stultz in Westlake's play, A.E., about the disappearance of Amelia Earhart, which won Westlake the Oregon Book Award in 1992. As a playwright he has had produced such plays as Jack, Trial By Error, Now Let Me Say This About That (about the John F. Kennedy autopsy) and The Sky Cams. From 1992 to 1994, Harrel produced and directed a 12-part series on Portland Cable Access that was created and written by E. Lauryl Nagode called The Gingerbread Man and starred Douglas Mouw. The controversial series about a serial killer caused concern among public-access television cable TV administrators in the greater Portland area. A memo about censoring public access programs that was distributed to cable operators mentioned The Gingerbread Man as a production depicting, \\"the life of a serial killer in his rape, mutilation and murder of victims. The show is acted out by members of a Portland-area theatre company.\\"Public access tv sex show angers viewers, by Bruce Westfall, The Columbian, July 24, 1994 Harrel also produced an anthology series from 1994 to 1996 and it was profiled in the short-lived arts newspaper Tonic in the summer of 1995. \\"The series draws on members of the local theatre community and the results are surprisingly decent.

The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \\"forlorn hope\\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.

A recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, he briefly commanded the 36th Infantry Division and then later led the 8th Panzer Division. He was relieved of his command for its performance during battles in Hungary in early 1945. He surrendered to British forces in May 1945 and was released three years later. He died in 1959. Biography Born in Dresden on 3 June 1894, Fr√∂lich joined the army of Imperial Germany in 1914, upon the outbreak of World War I, as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet). Posted to the Wuerttemberger 49th Field Artillery Regiment, he was commissioned a leutnant (second lieutenant) the following year. His regiment was attached to the 27th Infantry Division which was serving on the Western Front as part of the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps. He was wounded in May 1916 while participating in the corps' offensive in the Ypres Salient. After recovering from his wounds, he was posted to his regiment's I. Battalion as its adjutant. He continued to serve on the Western Front for the remainder of the war, seeing action in the areas around the Somme, Cambrai and Flanders. Fr√∂lich was retained in the postwar Reichswehr (Imperial Defence) and served initially with the 12th Artillery Regiment. He then held a series of battalion posts, none of which were in the artillery, and by 1929 was the adjutant of the 4th Transportation Battalion. He was then placed on the staff of the 4th Artillery Regiment and from 1931 to 1934 was a battery commander. By 1938, he was a Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) commanding the II. Battalion, 76th Panzer Artillery Regiment. His regiment was attached to the 1st Light Division during the Invasion of Poland. =World War II= After serving in Poland, the 1st Light Division returned to Germany where it began converting to a Panzer division. However, shortly after this process began, Fr√∂lich was appointed the commander of the 78th Panzer Artillery Regiment, which was part of the 7th Panzer Division, led by Generalmajor Erwin Rommel. He remained in command of the regiment throughout the Battle of France and then in Operation Barbarossa, where it was particularly effective in supporting the division as it advanced towards Moscow. Apart from a period in France while the division was resting after being heavily involved in the offensive mounted by the Soviet Army over the winter of 1941‚Äì42, Fr√∂lich served on the Eastern Front until after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. He was then given command of the 36th Infantry Division, which he led for only a few weeks before appointed commander of 8th Panzer Division in late September. His new command was then serving on the Eastern Front and would be in extensive action for several months. In December 1943, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to generalmajor. In March 1944, Fr√∂lich became sick and ceded command of the 8th Panzer Division to a former staff officer, Oberst Werner Friebe. However, Freibe proved to be an inadequate commander at divisional level and performed poorly in operations mounted in early July to rescue the XIII Corps, encircled by Soviet forces. The day after several regimental commanders of the division did not follow orders to advance, Fr√∂lich returned to his former command. He restored some order and launched an attack to relieve the XIII Corps but this failed and it was largely lost to the Soviets. Over 2,000 personnel of the division were casualties but it remained on the front lines. He led it adequately in the fighting retreat into Hungary, where the division destroyed the 34th Guards Rifle Division in early 1945. However, when sent to the Hungarian city of Kom√°rom, in which there were oil refineries still supplying the Nazi war effort, Fr√∂lich was unable to prevent the Soviet advance. It was only the intervention of German reinforcements that secured Kom√°rom. For his failure, Fr√∂lich was relieved of his command. Fr√∂lich, in mid-March 1945, took over command of the Korpsgruppe von Tettau (Corps Group von Tettau). This was an ad-hoc formation largely made up of Volkssturm and training units. Expected to defend two key cities in Pomerania along the Baltic Coast, he could do little to prevent their capture by the Soviets. The following month he was named Harko (Higher Artillery Commander) of the 3rd Panzer Army by General der Panzertruppe Hasso von Manteuffel, with whom he had served during his time with the 7th Panzer Division. When the 3rd Panzer Army moved west in May 1945, it, and Fr√∂lich, surrendered to British forces. He was released in May 1948 and lived in Meisenheim. He died in Heidenheim on 30 July 1959.

He was also noted for his ingenious escape from being captured by the Austro-Hungarians. Entry into service Stanley Stanger was an investment broker when he volunteered in Toronto for the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 21 March 1916. He claimed a year's prior military service in the Westmount Rifles with the rank of Sergeant. His mother Mary was named as his next of kin. He was five feet six inches tall at time of enlistment.

Retrieved on 30 September 2010. Aerial service Stanger was commissioned on 10 May 1917. He joined 66 Squadron in France as a Sopwith Camel pilot on 18 October 1917. Shortly thereafter, the squadron relocated to Italy. At Ormelle on 14 December 1917, Stanger forced down an Albatros D.V out of control for his first victory. He would score twice more with 66 Squadron, destroying two foes a month apart, on 18 March and 17 April 1918. On 27 April 1918, he transferred to 28 Squadron. He shot down opposing two-seater reconnaissance planes on 2, 3, and 13 May, becoming an ace in the process. He continued to score, and by the end of July, he was a double ace. On 23 August 1918, he was wounded in action by anti-aircraft fire. His wounds grounded him until 20 September. On 26 September 1918, he scored his eleventh win, sharing it with Clifford MacKay McEwen. Stanger then destroyed a pair of Albatros D.Vs over the Tagliamento River on 4 October to finish his victories. He ended up with a record of three enemy planes set afire in midair, another nine destroyed while in flight, and one driven down out of control. Stanger fell ill while he was aloft on one of his October sorties. He landed on a handy airfield and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown. Post World War I Stanger returned to the family business in Canada. He rose to President of that firm, Guardian Trust Company of Montreal, in 1939, and remained in that position until a few months prior to his death. Honors and awards Military Cross Lt. (T./Capt.)

Life and career King was born in 1893 in Fair Haven, Minnesota to Cyrus Murdock King and Minnie King (n√©e Cooper). His parents were the descendants of early settlers of the state and had been involved in local causes and politics in and around Itasca County, Minnesota. He was raised on the family homestead in Itasca County and attended school in Deer River, Minnesota. Later he attended the University of Minnesota and the St. Paul College of Law. During World War I King served in the army, first as an enlisted soldier on the Mexican border and later as a first lieutenant. After the war he worked in a variety of state and local government positions and also became active with the American Legion. In 1930 he won election as Minnesota State Auditor, a position he held for ten terms. During World War II he left his position on an unpaid leave of absence to serve as a lieutenant colonel with the United States Air Force. Between his political connections as state auditor and his social connections through various civic and community organizations, King made several attempts to win higher office (most notably running in the Republican primaries for governor against Luther Youngdahl in 1947 and against C. Elmer Anderson in 1952). King retired from office in 1969, and died just over a year later in 1970. After his death, a review of his personal papers found he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

The album comprises several previously unreleased tracks from throughout Weezer's career, with vocalist and guitarist Rivers Cuomo stating that the songs together make an album that should \\"logically follow Hurley\\". The album debuted at number 48 on the US Billboard 200. The album was released simultaneously with the deluxe edition of the band's second studio album, Pinkerton (1996). The title comes from a phrase coined by Manowar. Background and recording Originally known as Odds and Ends, the album was first mentioned by guitarist Brian Bell during the summer of 2008. Vocalist and guitarist Rivers Cuomo states that the tracks are \\"great songs, great recordings, but for some reason they didn't make the final cut for a record. And like the Alone record, they span a vast period of time from the very beginning of our career in the early '90s right up to the present day.\\" Frontman Rivers Cuomo considers Death to False Metal to be Weezer's ninth studio album. Band webmaster and historian Karl Koch describes the release differently as \\"a special album, [...] sort of like Weezer's version of Rivers' Alone records.\\" The version of \\"Mykel & Carli\\" on the iTunes version of the album differs from the previously released version on the \\"Undone ‚Äì The Sweater Song\\" single in 1994 and later the deluxe edition of the band's self-titled 1994 debut. It has been speculated by fans that it is the original 1993 recording of the song from The Blue Album sessions, with the more common previously released version known to have been recorded in the summer of 1994. \\"Mykel and Carli (appeared on many foreign singles, plus the \\"Hear You Me!\\" compilation)\\" The album's opening track, \\"Turning Up the Radio\\", is the product of Rivers Cuomo's YouTube songwriting project Let's Write a Sawng, a process where the frontman curated a 15-step program where people were free to submit ideas such as titles, chord progressions and melodies to create a collaborative song through the video-sharing platform. The resulting song has seventeen co-writers and involves tracks recorded across various locations. On September 25, 2014 it was announced that the album would be available on vinyl for the first time. The cover art for the album mimics that of a religious tract from Jehovah's Witnesses featuring an artist's impression of a perfect planet Earth. Reception According to Metacritic, Death to False Metal has received mixed reviews, receiving an average score of 56/100. AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, saying \\"It's a wonder why a few of these cuts didn't pop up before this, but as a collection of outtakes, they hold together better than some of the band's proper albums.\\" Drowned in Sound gave it a 4 out of 10, calling it \\"lineage of dumbed down music to even more dumb lyrics\\", citing songs such as \\"Blowin' My Stack\\" and \\"Trampoline\\".

It was made by Gainsborough Pictures at Elstree Studios. The film's sets were designed by the art director Wilfred Arnold. Production background The screenplay was also written by Mander in conjunction with Alma Reville. The First Born enjoys a good critical reputation, being seen as stylistically inventive and one of the best examples of a trend in British cinema in the last years of the silent era. This trend was towards a more mature, sophisticated and naturalistic presentation of dramatic material, eschewing the tendency in earlier silent films towards overly stagey and melodramatic acting styles involving wildly exaggerated gestures and facial expressions.The First Born Dixon, Bryony. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 1 October 2010 Plot Would-be politician Sir Hugo Boycott (Mander) and his wife Madeleine (Carroll) have an unhappy marriage. Madeleine is aware that Hugo is a serial philanderer, and their problems are exacerbated when she fails to produce the heir he wants. After a particularly serious quarrel, Hugo storms off to North Africa and one of his mistresses. In his absence, Madeleine drifts around in London society where she is courted by Lord David Harbrough (John Loder). She rebuffs his advances, but finds him sympathetic as an individual and agrees that they should remain friends. Madeleine learns that her manicurist is expecting a baby and is in a desperate state as she is unmarried and facing shame, the loss of her job and destitution. Madeleine offers to adopt the baby when it is born, which the manicurist gladly accepts. Hugo later returns from Africa and is delighted with the new son and heir which he assumes is his. Relations between the couple improve for a time, and Madeleine gives birth to her own baby. Hugo makes progress in his political ambitions and is invited to stand for parliament in an upcoming General Election. His political associates and potential constituents are charmed by Madeleine. It has not taken long however for him to revert to his womanising ways, and he becomes involved with the devious Nina (Ella Atherton). As the election approaches, Hugo finds out that the older boy is adopted, not his own child. He and Madeleine have a furious argument and he leaves to stay with Nina. On election night he is in a state of tension. He now quarrels with Nina also, stomps out of her apartment in a temper, and in a moment of inattention steps into an empty liftshaft and falls to his death. After his death, Madeleine receives a letter from the manicurist who has met a man who is willing to take on her and her son, she also unknowingly reveals in an ironic twist that Hugo was actually Stephen's father. In the wake of Hugo's death and the new revelations, Madeleine resolves to rekindle her romance with Lord David in the hope that she can finally find happiness.

CUPL was based on an earlier Cornell-developed programming language, CORC. It was used to teach introductory computer programming classes. CUPL was developed by R. W. Conway, W. L. Maxwell, G. Blomgren, Howard Elder, H. Morgan, C. Pottle, W. Riddle, and Robert Walker. CUPL had a very simple syntax similar to BASIC and to PL/I. The processor was designed to offer extensive error correction and diagnostic capabilities. This would allow student programs to execute even if they contained minor syntax errors. The compiler also included spelling correction capabilities so that if a variable name is referenced only once, the compiler would assume that it was a misspelling of some other intended name. CUPL also offered an extensive set of matrix operations and offered dynamic run-time memory allocation. At the time, Cornell's computer was an IBM System 360 Model 40 batch processing system with only 64K of core memory. CUPL was able to process a large number of student programs quickly by remaining resident in core memory, but the compiler occupied 58K of memory, leaving only a small amount for the program code and variable storage. Derivative projects Additional computer language projects grew out of CUPL. Most notably, the CUPL compiler was reworked to implement a subset of the PL/I programming language, called PL/C. PL/C retained the diagnostic and error correction features of CUPL. Audio CUPL was an implementation to accept verbal CUPL statements spoken by the programmer. Each programmer trained the system by first speaking a standard set of CUPL vocabulary words for reference. Retrocomputing implementation There is an implementation of CUPL and CORC in modern C for Unix-like systems that includes both transcriptions of the original manuals and a chrestomathy of programs in these languages. It is available at the Retrocomputing Museum. References * External links *Resource page for cupl 1.6, providing binary and source code and background information about CUPL and CORC.

History DreamForge was founded as Event Horizon Software, Inc. by the computer game developers Thomas Holmes, Christopher Straka and James Namestka in Greensburg. Until its dissolution the company produced several well-known and awarded computer games, most of them in the genre of role-playing games and strategy video games. After producing several games, the team changed its name to DreamForge Intertainment after learning that its Event Horizon name was shared with a developer of pornographic software. The company was dissolved in 2001 after struggles with its publishers while working on several titles, including the never finished game Werewolf: The Apocalypse - The Heart of Gaia, as well as Myst IV, with the latter being subsequently continued by a different studio.

It is a rare mineral that is found in calcium rich contact metamorphic rocks with increased amounts of boron. Uvite is trigonal hexagonal, which means that it has three equal length axes at 120 degrees, all perpendicular to its fourth axis which has a different length. Uvite is part of the space group 3m. Uvite's hardness has been measured to be 7.5 on the Mohs hardness scale. The color of uvite widely varies, depending on the sample, but is mostly deep green or brown. In regard to uvite's optical properties, it is uniaxial (-) and anisotropic, meaning that the velocity of light in the mineral depends on the path that it takes. In plane polarized light, uvite is colorless to pale yellow and shows weak pleochroism. Uvite was first found in 1929 in Uva Province, Sri Lanka, hence the name. Uvite has no use, but is commonly found in mineral specimen collections. The mineral is sought after by collectors because of its pronounced colors, crystal structure, and often large crystal size.
