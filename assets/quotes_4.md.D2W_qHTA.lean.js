Since its establishment in 1885, Narayanganj High School served the motherland in many ways. Narayanganj High School & College is a public school located in Kalir Bazar, Narayanganj Sadar Upazila, Bangladesh. The school offers education for students (boys) ranging from first grade to twelfth grade (approximately ages 6 to 18). With over 2,885 students, Narayanganj High School is one of the largest school in the Narayanganj city. Narayanganj High School & College is noted for its academic performance and extracurricular activities, having produced many notable alumni including leaders in business, the military and state, and national politics as well as senior government officers, scientists, and engineers. The Government of Bangladesh recognized the school for its strong performance in the Higher Secondary Certificate examination in 2011. History At first Narayanganj High School was an Anglo-vernacular school. It became an ME school in 1876 and finally it was promoted to high school in 1885. The school was located on the bank of the river Sitalakhya near Netaiganj from 1885 to 1907. In those days the school used to sit in a fenced house. The name of the first founder of the school is yet to be known. The school was shifted to its present location from Netaiganj in 1907 with the increase of students. The sub-divisional officer's bungalow was there at that time and the bungalow was also shifted to its present site in the same year. There was a pond behind the school named ‚ÄòOrnamental Tank‚Äô. The pond is filled up now and some buildings have been constructed. The name of the first headmaster of the school is yet to be known. Sharat Chandra Basu was the second headmaster (1888-1900). Nagendra Nath Pal took over the charge as headmaster of the school in 1900 while Sharat Babu left the profession. Mr Pal performed his duties competently. Taranath Dey was the most successful headmaster in the history of Narayanganj High School. During his period from 1922 to 1948 the reputation of this institution spread far and wide. Campus Narayanganj High School is located on the prime location of Narayanganj District. The campus is in southeast Narayanganj at S. K. Road, just opposite the Narayanganj Rail Junction. The campus consists of dormitories, teachers' quarters, staff quarters, an auditorium, an administrative building, and a full-size football field. A monument has been built in front of Main Building to commemorate those killed during the Bengali Language Movement demonstrations of 1952. The Language Movement was a political effort in East Pakistan, advocating the recognition of the Bengali language as an official language of Pakistan. =Buildings= With three buildings (including the newly built House), one of which is the Main Building, it is one of the largest school in the Narayanganj Sadar Upazila The school has one field and playgrounds. Two buildings known as Academic Buildings are used for academic purposes. Academic Building 1, is located at the northeast side; and Academic Building 2, is located at southeast corner of the campus. Academics The school offers primary education along with secondary education (Secondary School Certificate) for both boys. =Admission= Although Narayanganj High School operates from the 1st through the 10th grade, it only admits students into the 1st, and 6th grades. Consequently, the higher grades have fewer students than the lower grades, as a relatively large number of students transfer out. Admission in the 1st and 6th grades are based on admission tests in written and viva voice. The admission tests for Narayanganj High School are almost competitive. =Curriculum= The curriculum of Narayanganj High School includes traditional primary and secondary level academic subjects from the grade 1st to 5th and 6th to 10th respectively. The curriculum for secondary level academic subjects is introduced by the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Students of primary classes take academic core subjects including Bengali, English, mathematics, social science, general science, arts and crafts, religion and physical science. Students have to take agricultural science after completing their primary education. Students of the secondary level have to elect one of the three major programs: Arts and Humanities; Commerce; and Science. Students have some compulsory subjects and some optional subjects in each of the programs. =Academic performance= The Junior School Certificate(J.S.C.)and Secondary School Certificate (S.S.C.) examinations are conducted by the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Dhaka, Bangladesh under the Ministry of Education. S.S.C. is the diploma awarded for the completion of grades one to ten, which is equivalent to the O Levels in the UK. The S.S.C. examination consists of eleven subjects totaling 1,100 marks, with each subject given 100 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. A minimum of 33 marks are required to pass each subject. Subjects will depend on which major program a student has elected to study. These major programs are Sciences; Arts and Humanities; and Commerce. Students have to elect one of these three programs just before enrollment in the 9th grade for SSC, and again in the 11th grade for HSC. Results of both the exams are published in the form of a GPA. The highest score is GPA-5. The Dhaka Education Board annually ranks schools and colleges from across the country in terms of GPA-5 scorers. The Ministry of Education awarded the institution in 2010 for brilliant performance in the S.S.C. examination. =Uniform= Except in winter, the uniform for students from grades six to tenth consists of a short-sleeved white shirt with navy blue trouser. For students from grades one to fifth, the uniform is a short-sleeved white shirt with navy blue half pants. The uniform differs a bit during the winter season. In winter, students wear a navy blue sweater, in addition to shirt and pants. For footwear, students wear black Oxford shoes with white socks. In addition, college badge are included as part of the uniform.  Administration  Like a number of other schools the chief of the college and university section administration is the ‚ÄúHeadmaster‚Äù while there is an ‚ÄúAssistant Headmaster‚Äù of the primary and secondary sections. They are selected by the jury board from the veteran teachers. Current Headmaster of the institution is Sree Kamal Kanti Saha and since 2010 there is no Assistant Headmaster elected yet. The Governing body members are elected for 5 years by vote. The governing body's members are: There are no elected governing body now. A selected body continuing their own decision for their own interest. =Teachers= Primary section: 39 teachers, Secondary section: 42 teachers & College Section Teachers:05 Library There is a small library is situated in the Main Building. The collection of the library includes books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. It provides a small study space for students on campus; it may also provides group study space, such as meeting rooms.

Johannes Knud Ove Jais-Nielsen (23 April 1885 ‚Äì 8 November 1961) was a Danish painter, designer and ceramist, best known for the religious figure groups that he designed for the Royal Copenhagen pottery. Biography Nielsen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was married to artist Ville Jais Nielsen (n√©e Oppenheim). He died at Gentofte Hospital in Hellerup, Denmark and is buried at Mariebjerg Cemetery. Artistic career Stained glass windows by Jais Nielsen in the Flintholm Church, Copenhagen. Nielsen studied painting at the Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler under Kristian Zahrtmann and Johan Rohde, but abandoned the academic style under the influence of modern art that he saw on his study trips.Ulla Grut, \\"Jais Nielsen\\", Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbachs kunstnerleksikon. Retrieved 30 January 2013. Nielsen made several excursions to important art centres, travelling to Berlin (1909) and Paris (1911‚Äì1914). In 1920 he travelled to Italy, where he took a particular interest in the Renaissance art. Nielsen's art was influenced by the Cubism that he encountered in Paris. His paintings developed angular lines and fragmentation which, as in his early masterpiece Afgang (Departure), show a tendency towards Futurism. His paintings are predominantly of figures in motion and represent a wide range of subjects, including the circus, a subject which had inspired many avant-garde painters, including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec and Picasso. His work Circus Performance. Acrobats (1916) depicts trapeze artists soaring weightlessly through the air.\\"Jais Nielsen (1855‚Äì1961), Circus Performance, Acrobats, 1916\\", Statens Museum for Kunst. Retrieved 30 January 2013. His trip to Italy in 1920 was the inspiration for monumental works such as Brylluppet i Kana (Marriage at Cana). He also painted landscapes on Bornholm in a style resembling that of the other Bornholm painters. From 1915 Nielsen created sculptures in the Cubist style. From 1921 to 1928 he was employed as a sculptor by the Royal Copenhagen porcelain factory, for whom he produced a series of ceramic sculptures on Biblical subjects\\"Johannes Knud Ove Jais- Nielsen\\", Gravsted.dk. Retrieved 28 January 2013. which included the Good Samaritan and several versions of Jacob wrestling with the Angel. His sculptures were widely applauded and, for a time, their fame overshadowed that of his paintings. As well as statuettes, Nielsen produced ceramic wares in a wide range of shapes and monochrome glazes including celadon, ironstone and oxblood glaze. These pots are decorated with figures, mainly in relief but also engraved or painted, generally representing Biblical subjects. According to Ulla Grut \\"The resulting figures, for example 'The Potter', have a vigour of modelling and monumental effect that overrides the boundary between painting and sculpture.\\" Jais Nielsen decorated some of the Danish bookbinder August Sandgren's vellum bindings in water colour. Exhibitions * In 1909 and 1910 Nielsen joined the group of socially oriented artists known as De Tretten (The Group of Thirteen), exhibiting with them in 1909 and 1910. He later participated in modern art trends in Denmark but did not join the Danish artists' cooperative Gr√∏nningen. * In 1912 he exhibited at Salon d'Automne in Paris. * In 1960 an exhibition of his ceramics was held at Charlottenborg Palace, Copenhagen.Exhibition Catalogue * In 1986 Nielsen's painting Uscita! was the only work by a Danish artist represented in the Futurismo & Futurismi exhibition in Venice.Futur-ism, Futurismo & Futurismi, (accessed 12-02-2013) * Also in 1986, there was a retrospective exhibition of his works at Galerie 1900-2000 in Paris.Galerie 1900-2000 , Exhibition History, (accessed 12-02-2013) * In 2009, a large exhibition of his works was held at Bornholms Kunstmuseum.\\"Beretning 2009: Bornholms Kunstmuseum\\" , Bornholms Kunstmuseum.

Although it is thermodynamically unstable toward decomposition at ambient temperatures, it is kinetically metastable. Chromium(II) hydride is the second simplest polymeric chromium hydride (after chromium(I) hydride). In metallurgical chemistry, chromium(II) hydride is fundamental to certain forms of chromium-hydrogen alloys.  Nomenclature  The systematic name chromium dihydride, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the compositional nomenclature. However, as the name is compositional in nature, it does not distinguish between compounds of the same stoichiometry, such as molecular species, which exhibit distinct chemical properties. The systematic names poly(dihydridochromium) and poly[chromane(2)], also valid IUPAC names, are constructed according to the additive and electron-deficient substitutive nomenclatures, respectively. They do distinguish the titular compound from the others.  Dihydridochromium  Dihydridochromium, also systematically named chromane(2), is a related compound with the chemical formula (also written ). It is both thermodynamically and kinetically unstable at ambient temperature with the additional propensity to autopolymerise, and so cannot be concentrated. Dihydridochromium is the second simplest molecular chromium hydride (after hydridochromium), and is also the progenitor of clusters with the same stoichiometry. In addition, it may be considered to be the chromium(II) hydride monomer. Molecular chromium(II) hydrides with the formulae and have been isolated in solid gas matrices. The molecular hydrides are very unstable toward thermal decomposition. CrH2 is the major primary product in the reaction of laser-ablated chromium with molecular hydrogen. Dihydridochromium is the most hydrogenated, groundstate classical molecular hydride of chromium. In the presence of pure hydrogen, dihydridochromim readily converts to bis(dihydrogen)dihydridochromium, CrH2(H2)2 in an exothermic reaction.  Properties  = Acidity = An electron pair of a Lewis base can join with the chromium centre in dihydridochromium by adduction: : + :L ‚Üí Because of this capture of an adducted electron pair, dihydridochromium has Lewis acidic character. Dihydridochromium is a strong Lewis acid with the capacity to capture at least five electron pairs from Lewis bases. It should be expected that chromium dihydride clusters and chromium(II) hydride have similar acid properties, although reaction rates and equilibrium constants are different. = Structure = In diluted chromane(2), the molecules are known to oligomerise forming at least dichromane(4) (dimers), being connected by covalent bonds. The dissociation enthalpy of the dimer is estimated to be 121 kJ mol‚àí1. CrH2 is bent, and is weakly repulsive to one hydrogen molecule, but attractive to two molecules of hydrogen. The bond angle is 118¬±5¬∞. The stretching force constant is 1.64 mdyn/√Ö. The dimer has a distorted rhombus structure with C2h symmetry.  Production  Dichromane(4) is produced synthetically by hydrogenation. In this process, chromium and hydrogen react according to the reaction: :Cr + ‚Üí This process involves atomic chromium as an intermediate, and occurs in two steps. The hydrogenation (step 2) is a spontaneous process. #Cr (s) ‚Üí Cr (g) #Cr (g) + (g) ‚Üí In an inert gas matrix atomic Cr reacts with H2 to make the dihydride when it is irradiated with ultraviolet light between 320 and 380 nm. The reaction of chromium with molecular hydrogen is endothermic. 380 nm or greater wavelength radiation is required to procure photochemically generated CrH2.  History  In 1979 the simplest molecular chromium(II) hydride with the chemical formula (systematically named chromane(2) and dihydridochromium) was synthesised and identified for the first time. It was synthesised directly from the elements, in a reaction sequence which consisted of simultaneous sublimation of chromium to atomic chromium and thermolysis of hydrogen, and concluded with codeposition in a cryogenic argon matrix to form chromane(2). In 2003 the dimer with the chemical formula (systematically named dichromane(4) and di-Œº- hydrido-bis(hydridochromium)) was synthesised and identified for the first time. It was also synthesised directly from the elements, in a reaction sequence which consisted of laser ablation of chromium to atomic chromium, followed by codeposition with hydrogen in a cryogenic matrix to produce chromane(2), and concluded with annealing to form dichromane(4).

Farming on celestial bodies, such as the Moon or Mars, shares many similarities with farming on a space station or space colony. But, depending on the size of the celestial body, may lack the complexity of microgravity found in the latter. Each environment would have differences in the availability of inputs to the space agriculture process: inorganic material needed for plant growth, soil media, insolation, relative availability of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen, and so forth. Introduction Zucchini plant in the Destiny lab The supply of food to space stations and other long duration missions is heavy and staggeringly expensive. One astronaut on the International Space Station requires approximately \\"1.8 kilograms of food and packaging per day\\". For a long-term mission, such as a four-man crew, three year Martian mission, this number can grow to as much as 24,000 lbs (or about 10,886 kgs). Due to the cost of resupply and the impracticality of resupplying interplanetary missions the prospect of growing food inflight is incredibly appealing. The existence of a space farm would aid the creation of a sustainable environment, as plants can be used to recycle wastewater, generate oxygen, continuously purify the air and recycle faeces on the space station or spaceship. Just 10m¬≤ of crops produces 25% of the daily requirements of 1 person, or about 180-210grams of oxygen.Kijk magazine 9/2015 This essentially allows the space farm to turn the spaceship into an artificial ecosystem with a hydrological cycle and nutrient recycling.Maggi F. and C. Pallud, (2010), Space agriculture in micro- and hypo-gravity: A comparative study of soil hydraulics and biogeochemistry in a cropping unit on Earth, Mars, the Moon and the space station, Planet. Space Sci. 58, 1996‚Äì2007, doi:10.1016/j.pss.2010.09.025.Maggi F. and C. Pallud, (2010), Martian base agriculture: The effect of low gravity on water flow, nutrient cycles, and microbial biomass dynamic, Advances in Space Research 46, 1257-1265, doi:10.1016/j.asr.2010.07.012 In addition to maintaining a shelf-life and reducing total mass, the ability to grow food in space would help reduce the vitamin gap in astronaut's diets and provide fresh food with improved taste and texture. Currently, much of the food supplied to astronauts is heat treated or freeze dried. Both of these methods, for the most part, retain the properties of the food pre-treatment. However, vitamin degradation during storage can occur. A 2009 study noted significant decreases in vitamins A, C and K as well as folic acid and thiamin can occur in as little as one year of storage. A mission to Mars could require food storage for as long as five years, thus a new source of these vitamins would be required. Supply of foodstuffs to others is likely to be a major part of early off-Earth settlements. Food production is a non-trivial task and is likely to be one of the most labor-intensive, and vital, tasks of early colonists. Among others, NASA is researching how to accomplish space farming. =Technical challenges= Advanced Astroculture soybean plant growth experiment A variety of technical challenges will face colonists who attempt to do off-Earth agriculture. These include the effect of reduced gravity, lighting, and pressure as well as increased radiation. Though greenhouses may solve many of the problems presented in space, their construction would come with their own set of technical challenges. Plants grown inflight experience a microgravity environment, and plants grown on the surface of Mars experience approximately 1/3 the gravity that earth plants do. However, so long as plants are provided with directional light, those grown in low gravity environments still experienced normal growth. Normal growth is classified as opposite root and shoot growth direction. This being said many plants grown in a space flight environment have been significantly smaller than those grown on earth's surface and grew at a slower rate. In addition to varying effects of gravity, unless protected, plants grown on the surface of Mars will be exposed to much higher levels of radiation than on Earth. Exposure to high levels of radiation can damage plant DNA. This occurs as highly reactive hydroxyl radicals target DNA. DNA degradation has a direct effect on plant germination, growth and reproduction. Ionizing radiation also has an effect on PSII function and may cause a loss of function and generation of radicals responsible for photo- oxidation. The intensity of these effects vary from species to species. The low-pressure environment of the surface of Mars has also been a cause for concern. Hypobaric conditions can affect net photosynthesis and evapotranspiration rates. However, a 2006 study suggests maintaining elevated CO2 concentrations can mitigate the effects of hypobaric conditions as low as 10 kPa to achieve normal plant growth. Martian soil contains a majority of the minerals needed for plant growth except for reactive nitrogen, which is a product of mineralization of organic matter. Since there is a lack of organic matter on the surface of mars, there is a lack of this component. Reactive nitrogen is a required constituent of soil used for plant growth, and it is possible that nitrogen fixing species, such as bacteria, could aide in the lack of reactive nitrogen series. However, a 2014 study suggested that plants were able to germinate and survive a period of 50 days on a Martian and lunar soil by using simulant soils. This being said, only one of their four experimented species did well enough to achieve full flower formation and more work would need to be done to achieve complete growth.

It is about east of Stow- on-the-Wold and west of Chipping Norton. The village of Daylesford lies nearby to the west, Adlestrop to the north, Cornwell to the east, and Kingham to the south, The house has been listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England since 1960, and its gardens were subsequently Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens in 1986. The grounds include an orangery in late 18th century Gothick style, which has a separate Grade I listing. The stable block and ice house in the grounds are also separately Grade II listed. History The former manor house of Daylesford was acquired in 1788 by Warren Hastings, former Governor-General of India, along with an estate of , for ¬£54,000. Warren Hastings was descended from the Hastings family that had owned the manor from the 12th to 14th century, and then again from the 15th century until it was sold in 1715 by Hastings's grandfather to a merchant from Bristol, Jacob Knight. Knight began the construction of a new house in about 1730, but the new house remained unfinished when both Knight and his eldest son John died in 1788. Hastings had previously offered twice the value of the land to get the house back, and he finally acquired the estate in 1788 from a younger son Thomas Knight. The shell was remodelled by Hastings from around 1788 to 1793 to designs by Samuel Pepys Cockerell, architect to the East India Company, to create a broadly Neoclassical house with some features inspired by Indian architectural styles. Cockerell took the Indian motifs further at Sezincote House, built for his brother Sir Charles Cockerell nearby. After his death in 1818, Hastings was buried at St Peter's church in Daylesford nearby, and the house was occupied by his widow Marian until her death in 1837, and then by her son (Hastings' stepson) Sir Charles Imhoff until he sold it in 1853 to stockbroker Harman Grisewood. During Grisewood's period of ownership, alterations were made to the interiors and exteriors by Robert Trollope. After Grisewood's death in 1874, the house was acquired by R. Nichol Byass, and then it was sold in 1884 to Charles Edward Baring Young. Daylesford House was occupied by US soldiers in the Second World War and left in a dilapidated state. The house and estate were acquired by Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere in 1946. He restored the house with the help of the architect Philip Jebb and the interior decorator John Beresford Fowler. It was subsequently acquired by Baron Hans Thyssen for ¬£600,000 in the late 1970s. Thyssen hired the Italian designer Lorenzo Mongiardino to redecorate the interior at a cost almost equal to the purchase price of the house. Thyssen subsequently estimated that he had spent ¬£3 million on Daylesford, having renovated houses on the estate and increased the surrounding landholding to 12,000 acres. Thyssen described the expenditure as \\"...endless, and the weather was appalling, so we only went in the winter so at least we knew what to expect\\". It was sold in 1986 to Sir Anthony Bamford. The Earl of Snowdon and his family rent a cottage on the estate. House The exterior of the house exhibits a plain style of Neoclassicism, based on Palladio, with some fussy French details. The house has an \\"H\\" plan, with a central block of three stories, and wings of two stories, constructed from yellowish Stanway limestone ashlars. The south front was originally the main entrance, with canted bays at either end, reached by a drive that swept past the main west front. The main front was originally to the west, at the centre of which is a projecting semicircular bay, with four Ionic pillars and French Neoclassical garland swags around the architrave, topped by a shallow dome with pointed Coade stone finial, and wings projecting to either side. The oriental-inspired dome predates the publication of architectural aquatints of Thomas Daniell and William Daniell in 1796, and the domes of Sezincote and Brighton Pavilion. The main entrance was moved to the east front in the 19th century, with the addition of a late 19th century extension with projecting Tuscan porch and portico, and a flat roof. The interior is decorated in a plain Classical style, with two fireplaces by Thomas Banks and one by John Bacon with Indian motifs. Hasting's original decoration scheme made frequent use of gold and crimson, and displayed his collection of oriental-style furniture. The main rooms face south and west, with views downhill over the park, and the services are located on the wood-shrouded northern side. A circular boudoir in the dome, facing west, was the main state bedroom, has a high domed ceiling, and a segmental bay. A curved curve stable block is located near the house. Gardens Hastings also laid out the gardens and grounds, which were landscaped by John Davenport. To the west of the house is a lawn with views across a ha-ha to the park, and there are terraces to the south and east. The main formal approach was from Daylesford village to the south-west, through a park of approximately , with many mature trees and areas of woodland, two lakes (one of which has an island, formerly the site of a decorative temple), and a walled kitchen garden. A garden of approximately surrounds the house, with mainly 19th century planting. About east of the house is an orangery which was constructed in 1789‚Äì90 to designs by Davenport. In Gothick style, the seven-bay building is constructed from ashlars, with tall pointed windows facing south over the park, a pediment above the central three bays, round wings at either end, and battlements with pinnacles. Many details are based on the pattern books of Batty Langley. Some of the stonework in the grounds may be derived from the Grey Geese of Adlestrop, a collection of stones (possibly a neolithic monument) found on the top of Adelstrop Hill nearby.

It shares its power plant with the street version SR500 and its off-road brother, the Yamaha TT500. All parts such as the transmission and chassis were produced in Japan. The first XT 500 was shown at the US dealer convention in September 1975, and in Europe in the summer of 1976. The bike became an instant success and was produced until 1981 when it was replaced by four-valve engines. It laid the ground for the later range of XT bikes ranging from 125 cc (XT125) to the current 660 cc (Yamaha XT660Z T√©n√©r√©) and contributed largely to Yamaha's image. In France alone, 62,000 XT 500s were sold from 1976 to 1990. The XT won the first big African rallies, which were on the rise in the late seventies. It started with Paris‚ÄìAbidjan-Nice and then the Paris‚ÄìDakar Rally, which confirmed the supremacy of the XT 500. Bengt √Öberg competed in the 1977 500cc Motocross World Championship on a highly modified Yamaha XT500 built in collaboration with former world champions Torsten Hallman and Sten Lundin. √Öberg rode the bike to a victory in the first moto of the 1977 500cc Luxembourg Grand Prix and ended the season ranked 9th in the final world championship standings. The 21-inch front wheel and the 18-inch rear with enduro-style tires make it fit for both on- and off-road use. Seat height and ground clearance are adequate and the machine has the typical dual-purpose handling characteristics, which makes it suitable for a wide range of duties, from crossing rough city roads to country lanes or paths. The XT range debuted in 1976 with the XT500 four- stroke single. Later, other models followed, spreading from XT125 to the latest XT660. Both the XT and TT ranges represent the typical Yamaha model development consistency, with model refinements over a long period of time. After 1982 the successive four-valve XT600s were sold in some markets in 500 cc form until 1989, but this was not the original, classic twin-valve XT500.

In 843-4, during the caliphate of al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847), he was arrested as part of a general purge of the secretaries and was punished with a fine and flogging, but he was subsequently released and allowed to retain his office.Al-Tabari, v. 34: pp. 8‚Äì9 Under al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), he became the chief secretary for the caliph's son and second heir al-Mu'tazz, and was also appointed as the vizier 'Ubaydallah ibn Yahya's deputy over the Department of Taxation (diwan al-kharaj).Al-Ya'qubi, p. 595; al-Tabari, v. 34: p. 164 During the civil war between the rival caliphs al-Musta'in and al- Mu'tazz in 865, Ahmad joined al-Musta'in after the latter fled to Baghdad, and remained in the city as it was besieged by al-Mu'tazz's army.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 83 As the war dragged on, however, he became a proponent of ending the conflict, and attempted to convince the governor of Baghdad, Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah ibn Tahir, to seek peace with al-Mu'tazz and force al-Musta'in to abdicate.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 103‚Äì04 After Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah agreed to sue for peace, Ahmad served as a leading member of the delegations sent to negotiate the terms of surrender, which resulted in al-Musta'in being deposed in January 866.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 97, 106 As a reward for his efforts to end the war, al-Mu'tazz appointed Ahmad as the head of the Department of the Post (diwan al-barid)Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 105 and shortly thereafter promoted him to be his vizier.Al-Tabari, v. 35: p. 115; Sourdel, p. 295 Ahmad remained vizier for most of al-Mu'tazz's caliphate (866‚Äì869), but his authority appears to have been limited.Sourdel, p. 296 During his vizierate, the caliphate suffered from a major fiscal crisis, and the government was frequently incapable of paying the salaries of the soldiers.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 143, 146 Ahmad also worked with the caliph to weaken the power of the senior Turkish officers, who had been in effective control of affairs in the capital since 861. In late 866 al-Mu'tazz attempted to remove Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Sharabi, two generals who had sided with al-Musta'in during the civil war, from power, but the caliph was forced to reverse his decision when the army protested this action, and after negotiating with the two men, Ahmad restored them to their positions.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 122‚Äì24 Despite this, al-Mu'tazz and Ahmad continued in their efforts to destroy the officers, and they succeeded in having Bugha killed in 868, which, combined with Wasif's death the previous year, resulted in the influence of the military being temporarily reduced.al-Tabari, p. 146; 152-54; Sourdel, pp. 296‚Äì97; Bosworth, pp. 794‚Äì95 Ultimately, however, the Turkish commanders successfully regained their power,Sourdel, pp. 297‚Äì98 and Ahmad's vizierate was brought down as a result. On May 19, 869, one of the Turkish leaders, Salih ibn Wasif, complained to the caliph about Ahmad and two other senior officials, al-Hasan ibn Makhlad and Abu Nuh 'Isa ibn Ibrahim, accusing them of corruption and of failing to pay the troops. A heated argument ensued between Salih and the three men, which ended when Salih's guards entered the room, apprehending the secretaries and hauling them away to the general's residence. Ahmad, al-Hasan and Abu Nuh were incarcerated and beaten, and an order was issued to seize the estates and properties of the officials and their families. They were not released until they promised to pay a large fine, which would be collected in installments.Al-Tabari, v. 35: pp. 161‚Äì63; al-Yaq'ubi, p. 616; Sourdel, p. 298; Shaban, p. 85 In July 869, al-Mu'tazz was deposed and replaced with another caliph, al-Muhtadi.Bosworth, p. 794 Shortly after the new caliph's accession, Salih ibn Wasif again seized the three secretaries and ordered them to be tortured, in an attempt to extract any remaining wealth they may still have had. Although al-Muhtadi disapproved of Salih's actions, he did nothing to stop him. On September 8, after securing a fatwa authorizing their execution, Salih had Ahmad and Abu Nuh brought to the public gate of the caliphal palace. There the two men were ordered to be flogged, with both men receiving five hundred lashes. After this, they were loaded onto donkeys and they were paraded around the city; both men died of their wounds during the procession.Al-Tabari, v. 36: pp. 9‚Äì12; al-Ya'qubi, p. 617; Sourdel, p. 299  Notes   References   Shaban, M.A. Islamic History: A New Interpretation, Volume 2, A.D. 750‚Äì1055 (A.H. 132‚Äì448).

Life and career William Daly was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of a successful song-and-dance man. He attended Harvard University receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1908. By 1911 he was a writer, editor, and eventually general manager for Everybody's Magazine in New York. Daly left the company in 1914 to pursue a show business career. He married in 1915 settling in New York City. Daly played piano with various Broadway orchestras, and in time established himself as a songwriter, arranger, orchestrator, and music director, conducting more than twenty shows between 1915 and 1934. He met George and Ira Gershwin in the late 1910s. Daly and George Gershwin collaborated on several Broadway scores. Both contributed songs to Piccadilly to Broadway (1920), a show which closed in Atlantic City, and For Goodness' Sake (1922). The two jointly composed the score for Our Nell in 1923. This was the beginning of a long friendship; Daly was a frequent arranger, orchestrator and conductor of Gershwin's music, and Gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice. Gershwin dedicated his 1926 Preludes for Piano to Daly. Around 1930, Daly also became conductor and music director of the National Broadcasting Company radio orchestra. Daly died suddenly of a heart attack in December 1936.

Wilson Chair in Humanities at Rhodes College. Judaken previously taught at the University of Memphis where he was the Dunavant Professor of History and Director of the Marcus Orr Center for the Humanities. His fields of expertise include European cultural and intellectual history, discussions of Jews and Judaism, race and racism, and post-Holocaust French philosophy. Judaken is a notable scholar of Jean-Paul Sartre and Sartre's relationship to Jews and Judaism and race and racism, as well as contemporary French Jewish philosophers.  Scholarship  Judaken is the author of Jean-Paul Sartre and the Jewish Question: Anti-antisemitism and the Politics of the French Intellectual, in which he argues that \\"representations of Jews and Judaism as persistent figures of alterity serve as a fecund site to interrogate and reevaluate [Sartre's] oeuvre, especially his conception of the role of the intellectual.\\" He is the editor of three volumes compiling scholarly contributions to the study of race and racism, existentialism, and the intersection between them: Race After Sartre: Antiracism, Africana Existentialism, Postcolonialism, Naming Race, Naming Racisms, and most recently Situating Existentialism: Key Texts in Context, which provides a history of the systemization and canonization of existentialism as a philosophical movement. In addition, Judaken is U.S. consulting editor for the journal Patterns of Prejudice and has been a scholar in residence at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. He has held memberships in the Association for Jewish Studies, American Historical Association, American Academy of Religion, and the International Society for the Study of European Ideas. Judaken is a founding member of the International Consortium for Research on Antisemitism and Racism (ICRAR), an organization of European, American, and Israeli scholars aimed at \\"revitalising and reshaping the study of antisemitism.\\" In his scholarship on anti-Semitism, Judaken is critical of the concept of a \\"New anti-Semitism\\", arguing \\"there is not much empirical evidence to support the idea that a new alliance between Leftists and jihadists cemented together by anti-Zionism is emerging.\\" Judaken has expressed support for the term \\"new Judeophobia\\", coined by Pierre-Andr√© Taguieff, as a better means of characterizing the recent upsurge of violence and hatred against Jews.  Biography  Judaken was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on February 23, 1968. Judaken's youthful experience as a Jew living under South African apartheid, as a member of both a religious minority and the dominant racial group, helped to drive his career interest in subjects such as existentialism, racism and the so-called Jewish Question. After immigrating to the United States as a teenager, Judaken received a B.A. in philosophy from the University of California, San Diego and an M.A. and Ph.D in history from the University of California, Irvine. After completing a post- doctoral fellowship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Judaken joined the history faculty at the University of Memphis in 1999. He left the University of Memphis for Rhodes College in 2011, where he was appointed the first Spence L. Wilson Chair in Humanities. In his capacity as Spence L. Wilson Chair, Judaken directs the Communities in Conversation program, which facilitates interdisciplinary lectures and events for Rhodes students, faculty and the general public in Memphis. In 2019, Judaken was selected as a committee member for Rhodes College's new Jewish, Islamic, and Middle East Studies Program, which houses three different minors in (1) Jewish Studies; (2) Islamic and Middle East Studies: and (3) Jewish, Islamic and Middle East Studies.

R. Gibbs using the 1.5-m reflector at the Mt. Lemmon Survey, located at the summit of Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, Arizona, USA. Initially, the object was considered to be of asteroidal nature before later observations confirmed its cometary appearance. Comet Lemmon has a highly eccentric orbit, bringing it as close to 0.73 AU from the sun at perihelion and as far as 973 AU from the sun at aphelion. This also leads to the comet's long-period nature with an orbital period of approximately 8,000 years based on epoch 2050. The comet last reached perihelion on 24 March 2013. For much of 2012, observation of Lemmon remained limited to CCD imagery, but steadily brightened throughout the course of the year. In late-November 2012, the comet became bright enough for telescopic viewing, and had an apparent magnitude estimated at +9 by the year's end. Brightening continued into the early months of 2013 before peaking at an apparent magnitude of +5 in late March, though viewing was mostly limited to the Southern Hemisphere. On 24 March 2013, Lemmon reached its orbital perihelion and afterwards began to dim. On 20 April 2013, Lemmon crossed the celestial equator and became primarily viewable in the Northern Hemisphere, though by this time the comet was significantly dimmer relative to its peak brightness.  Discovery  A.R. Gibbs of the Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona discovered the comet based on images acquired by the sky survey's 1.5-m reflecting telescope on 23 March 2012. However, Gibbs did not recognize its cometary appearance and was listed as an asteroid on the Minor Planet Center's Near Earth Object confirmation page. At the time, the apparent magnitude of the comet was estimated between +20.6 and +20.8. Shortly after initial discovery, amateur astronomer Peter Birtwhistle in Great Shefford observed the comet using a 40-cm refracting telescope and CCD images, estimating an apparent magnitude of +20.1 and a diameter stretching 5 arc seconds across.  Observational history  Following discovery, Lemmon remained a dim object but steadily brightened over the next few months. The comet was last sighted on 14 June 2012 with an apparent magnitude estimated at +19.0 before it was lost in the sun's glare. On 25 August, the comet was analyzed to have passed an apparent 0.7 degrees from the sun. The comet was re-sighted on 14 October utilizing the RAS (Remote Astronomical Society) Observatory of New Mexico in Mayhill, with an apparent magnitude estimated to have brightened to +15.3. The first confirmed visual observation of the comet without the use of CCD imagery was conducted by Juan Jose Gonzalez Suarez in Cantabria, Spain using a 20-cm reflector on 22 November. Several other visual confirmations were made throughout the rest of the year. By the end of 2012, the comet had a coma 5-7 arc minutes across and an apparent magnitude estimated at +9. It was well placed for viewing in the southern hemisphere in January 2013 to observe it brightening, crossing Centaurus, Crux and Chamaeleon, and into February when it was circumpolar in Octans. By the end of February it set early evening situated in Phoenix, was observable well into March. After perihelion the comet should be reasonably well placed in the morning sky to observe as it fades. The comet was visible in the STEREO heliospheric imager HI-2A starting on 17 April. C/2012 F6 crossed the celestial equator on 20 April 2013 becoming a northern hemisphere object. On 9 May 2013 the comet was near Gamma Pegasi and from a dark sky was visible in binoculars before sunrise low in the eastern sky. On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of HCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON).

History  Before 1978, all trial courts except the Land Court were county or local courts funded through the counties. The Massachusetts Trial Court was created by Chapter 478 of the Acts of 1978 that reorganized the courts into seven Trial Court Departments. Administrative Justices became responsible for the administration of each court department and as part of the overhaul, all judges became state judges with the same salary and benefits. A second court reorganization in 1992 greatly expanded the Juvenile Court Department and ended trial de novo in the District Court Department. It also replaced Administrative Justices with Chief Justices and created a central office headed by the Chief Justice for Administration and Management. , there are 9 Chief Justices and 401 Associate Justices positions authorized by statute in the system with trial judges sitting in more than one 130 locations across the state.

A Photographic Guide To The Insects Of New Zealand. New Holland Publishers (NZ) Ltd. . It is a generalized pollinator of a large range of plants that are both native and exotic to the New Zealand flora. M. novaezelandiae is widespread throughout New Zealand, including in agricultural environments. The larvae of this species feeds on other arthropods and may have uses as a biocontrol agent. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1849 as Syrphus ortas by F. Walker. It was described again in 1855 by Pierre-Justin-Marie Macquart as Syrphus novaezelandiae. In 1875, it was described yet again as Syrphus rectus by M. S. Nowicki. In 1969, it was transferred from the genus Syrphus to Melangyna, and placed in the newly erected subgenus Austrosyrphus. It is sometimes referred to as Melangyna novaeze _a_ landiae although this name is a less frequently used misspelling of the name in the original species description. In 2008, Christian Thompson recognized M. novaezelandiae, S. ortas, and S. rectus as being the same species (synonyms). Although the species name should traditionally have gone to ortas, the oldest name, he chose to make novaezelandiae the recognized species since its was in widespread use. The name Syrphus rectus has also been used for a North American species, the yellow-legged flower fly, named by Osten Sacken in 1875. Description Adult female Most of the body of Melangyna novaezelandiae is coloured metallic black with a green yellow tint. The eyes are a dark reddish- brown colour. There are also six cream coloured bands arranged into three rows on the abdomen. The body has curly hairs scattered throughout the body which are thought to collect pollen. The body has a length of about 7-10.4mm. Males and females are mostly identical, but can be distinguished by whether the eyes are touching dorsally (male) or not (female).Stephen D. Wratten, Anthony J. White, M. H. Bowie, Nadine A. Berry, Ursula Weigmann, Phenology and Ecology of Hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in New Zealand, Environmental Entomology, Volume 24, Issue 3, 1 June 1995, Pages 595‚Äì600, https://doi.org/10.1093/ee/24.3.595 The hoverfly forages with rapid movements followed by stationary periods. Adult M. novaezelandiae are usually only seen from spring to autumn (the warmer months in the southern hemisphere). Egg production is thought to also occur from spring to autumn. The eggs of the flies are laid in close proximity to aphid colonies, which the larvae feed on once they hatch. Distribution and habitat Melangyna novaezelandiae is widespread throughout New Zealand and can even be found as far as the Chatham Islands.Melangyna novaezelandiae (Macquart, 1855) in GBIF Secretariat (2017). GBIF Backbone Taxonomy. Checklist dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-08-23.Macfarlane,R.P. 1979: Notes on insects of the Chatham Islands. N.Z. ENTOMOL.: 7(1):64-70M. novaezelandiae can be found in a wide range of habitats including subalpine zones and agricultural habitats. In the agricultural areas of New Zealand, M. novaezelandiae is one of the two most common species of hoverfly present (the other species is Melanostoma fasciatum). Diet The larvae of Melangyna novaezelandiae are predators that often feeds on aphids, but have also been observed feeding on other arthropods such as scale insects and moth larvae (particularly Pieris rapae and Plutella xylostella). Because of this diet, the larvae have been considered for use as biocontrol agents in New Zealand to manage aphids and other pests that damage crops in agricultural habitats. In contrast to the diet of the larvae, the adults of M. novaezelandiae are herbivorous and feed on pollen to develop their reproductive systems, and on nectar for energy, which may make them a useful pollinator. A previous study that linked gut fullness with egg production has suggested that this finding provides evidence for pollen being used in reproductive system development. It has also been noted that females tend to feed on pollen more frequently than males since the female reproductive system is more costly to develop. Studies of the gut contents of M. novaezelandiae found that pollen grain sizes varied from 19Œºm to 47Œºm. Due to these differences in diet at various stages of their life cycle, M. novaezelandiae may be described as having \\"life history omnivory\\". Pollination Melangyna novaezelandiae are known to be frequent pollinators in both agricultural and natural settings, including subalpine zones. Like many syrphids, M. novaezelandiae is a very generalized pollinator and will visit many species of flower. Observations have noted that the fly will walk between flowers if they are closely clustered together, but will take flight if they are spread apart. In one study of pollination in subalpine zones, it was found that M. novaezelandiae visited more species of flower than any other pollinator observed in that study. In agricultural areas it was found that M. novaezelandiae was the second most common visitor of crop flowers, so may have an important role in pollination. A study about the pollination of bok choy crops in New Zealand investigated the effectiveness of M. novaezelandiae and several other species as a pollinator for these crops. The finding of this study is that M. novaezelandiae had very low effectiveness (they transferred very little pollen between flowers) when compared to that of typical pollinators such as bumblebees and honey bees, which is likely to be attributed to its lack of specialization. These findings are similar to those of similar studies of this hoverfly. One study found that M. novaezelandiae are most attracted to yellow colours, which may be an important cue in finding floral resources. A small selection of species of flower that M. novaezelandiae is known to visit includes Trifolium pratense, Raoulia grandiflora, Leptospermum scoparium, Celmisia spectabilis and Melicytus species. Biogeography Although there appears to be no research into the origin of this species, one study has suggested that Melangyna novaezelandiae likely evolved after dispersing over from Australia (which has other species of Melangyna, including M. viridiceps and M. damastor').

The club was founded at Anderson Park, Mt Albert in 1943 and moved to its present site in the 1960s with the construction of the Lovelock Track which was opened on April 15, 1961. During the 1960s the club led the world in middle and long distance running under the guidance of the legendary coach Arthur Lydiard (ONZ,OBE). The club has produced many international and national champions, most notably, Murray Halberg (ONZ, MBE) and the New Zealand Athlete of the Century, Peter Snell (KNZM, MBE). It is the training group of Murray Halberg, Peter Snell, Barry Magee, Bill Baillie, Jeff Julian and Ray Puckett known as Arthur's Boys which captures the history of this era. They all trained together and were made Olympians by the end of the 1960s training off the famed Waitarua run through the challenging backblocks of Auckland. With strong coaching a theme during the clubs lifetime, the club is associated with two great coaches, both inaugural inductees of the New Zealand Athletics Coach Hall of Fame: Arthur Lydiard (ONZ,OBE) and through Arch Jelley, OBE, (coach of 1976 Olympic 1500m gold medallist John Walker) the club continued its success producing Olympians, International and National champions through to the turn of the century. The late 1990s and into the 2000s saw the club's senior membership dwindle to social membership as organisational politics led to the senior membership amalgamating with College Rifles Harrier Club to form Auckland City Athletics Club with the goal of rivaling larger Auckland regional athletic clubs. Throughout the 2000s the junior membership of the club continued to be run by club stalwarts who persevered and preserved the club as a piece of international athletic history. Over the next ten years, the members entered non-competitive teams into relay events and maintained the children‚Äôs athletics programme. In 2009 the club worked with the Auckland City Council to build new facilities for the club and a new youth centre on the site of the old clubrooms at the Lovelock Track. During the 50th anniversary year of the 1961 Lovelock Track opening, Sir Murray Halberg opened the new clubrooms which coincided with the launch of a new five-year plan to rebuild the full membership of the club. Late in 2012 saw the closure of the existing Lovelock track and earthworks to begin on the resurfacing of old asphalt and black rubber surface to bring the track to competition standard once again. In September 2013, Owairaka celebrated its 70th Jubillee and will celebrate its 75th in 2018.

The game of indoor cricket can be played in any suitably sized multi-purpose sports hall. There is evidence of the game being played in the 1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, it was played in the 1960s as a means of giving amateur and professional cricketers a means of playing their sport during the winter months. The first recorded organised indoor cricket league in the world took place in 1970 in North Shropshire, and the first national tournament was completed in 1976 with over 400 clubs taking part. By 1979 over 1000 clubs were taking part in indoor cricket in the UK, and it remains extremely popular today with many leagues around the country.\\"Lord's joy for Whitstable\\" from ECB, accessed 28 January 2013 Other forms of indoor cricket have been developed, based on variations of the indoor game. The game itself bears much in common with its outdoor cousin, with a hard ball and a full length pitch being used. Indoor Cricket can be played in any suitably sized sports hall or similar shaped indoor arena. If necessary, a mat is rolled out on the floor to replicate the playing conditions of a cricket pitch. This format should not be confused with the netted variant played elsewhere around the world, predominantly in Australia and South Africa. The game of indoor cricket In terms of the concept of the game, indoor cricket is similar to cricket. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler bowls the ball to the batsman who must score runs by hitting the ball with his bat. The fielding team attempt to prevent the scoring of runs and dismiss the batsman. Each team takes it in turn to bat, and the team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its outdoor counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained. Typical rules The rules of 6-aside indoor cricket are identical to that of outdoor cricket with the following exceptions, some of which may vary between local leagues. : There are six players per team, and the game is played over innings of a maximum of 12 overs of six balls, all of which take place from the same end of the pitch. Bowlers are limited to a maximum of three overs, and batsman must retire upon reaching a personal total of twenty-five runs, but may return to the crease in the event of the rest of their side being dismissed within the 12 overs. In the event of a team losing five wickets within the 12 overs the last man will continue batting with the fifth man out remaining at the wicket as a runner. A batsman may be caught out and dismissed directly off the side wall, provided the ball has not also hit the floor or the roof. =System of Scoring= Typical Layout and Field Settings: Blue circles denote fielders, Red circles denote batsmen, Green circle denotes umpire. Boundary wall is shown with red line. A ball that is struck to hit the boundary wall behind the bowler without touching the floor or any other part of the wall or roof part scores six runs. A ball that is struck to hit the boundary wall behind the bowler and also touches the floor but does not touch any of the other walls or roof and hits the back boundary wall scores four runs. In some leagues these scores are switched around to discourage an over-emphasis on aerial shots. A ball struck to hit one or more of the side walls will count as one run, even if the ball subsequently hits the back boundary wall. If the ball is struck to hit a side wall and a batsman is then dismissed (for example caught or run out), one run will still be scored. A ball struck directly to hit the roof becomes dead immediately. No runs will be scored and there will be no dismissal. The ball will not be rebowled. A ball that hits the roof having previously hit a wall is still in play. At some venues, the roof acts as a side wall where 1 run is allocated when the ball touches it, but a fielder can catch the ball and the batsmen is out caught. Two runs will be scored if the batsmen complete a run at any time. These runs may be scored on top of a run for hitting a side wall, including a bye or leg bye, but not on top of a boundary. A bye will count as one run if the ball bowled hits a wall. A leg bye will count as one run if the ball hits a side wall after deflecting off the batsman's pads or body. If the bowler oversteps the crease, bowls a full toss over waist height, or the ball does not pitch on the playing mat, a no- ball will be called and the batting side will be awarded one run. An extra ball will be bowled. Any runs on top of this will still count as usual. Wide balls will be called as with orthodox cricket rules. Strategy The strategy of indoor cricket differs from its outdoor cousin because of the different scoring system. The quickest way to score runs is to hit a boundary against the back wall and score 4 or 6 runs. In order to prevent this, the two best fielders from the fielding side are generally positioned in front of this wall in order to prevent the ball from reaching it. If the batsman is unable to hit the ball against the back wall, he may instead resort to attempting to score 3 runs by hitting the ball against a side wall and completing a quick single with his partner. In order to attempt to prevent this, the remaining two fielders are generally placed on either side of the batsman in front of the side wall. Using these tactics, a typical score in a 12 over 6 aside game will vary between 100 and 140 runs per side. Popularity Indoor Cricket is extremely popular around the UK with many regional and local leagues run independently but loosely affiliated to the ECB. Amateur club teams will often field an 11 aside team in the summer and an indoor 6 aside team in the winter. The better teams in the country can qualify for the ECB National Indoor Cricket Cup, which is the highest standard of Indoor Cricket played in the UK. The game is also widely played at University level.

Sanford (c. 1907 ‚Äì August 8, 1966) was an American baseball player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He served as the head baseball coach at Randolph‚ÄìMacon College from 1942 to 1949 and at Wake Forest University from 1951 to 1955. He led the Wake Forest Demon Deacons baseball team to the 1955 College World Series championship. Early life Sanford was born to Dr. and Mrs. T. Ryland Sanford in about 1907. He later attended Hargrave Military Academy where he was an all-state athlete in football, basketball and baseball. He then enrolled at the University of Richmond. Playing career Sanford was captain of the Richmond Spiders football, basketball, and baseball teams, and set school records in the shot put and discus. He then played baseball professionally in the Bi-State and Piedmont leagues while also coaching prep and college teams. He ended his professional career in 1946, having never climbed higher than Class B. He was listed as a scout for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball in 1948.Spink, J.G. Taylor, ed., 1948 Official Baseball Guide and Record Book. St. Louis: The Sporting News Coaching career Sanford began his coaching career at Hargrave, coaching for thirteen years at the prep school. He became athletic director and coach of the baseball and basketball teams at Randolph‚ÄìMacon. His teams won a total of five conference championships over his seven years in Ashland, Virginia, before moving to Wake Forest as freshman football coach. In his second year at Wake Forest, he added baseball to his coaching duties while continuing in various assistant coaching roles with the football team. Most notably, the Deacs won the Atlantic Coast Conference and College World Series in 1955. During the College World Series, a rainout forced a game on Sunday, sparking a small controversy at the Baptist school when word reached Wake Forest. This followed word that Sanford would not be kept full-time after the 1956 season and little recognition from the school of his achievement in Omaha.

TMTI provides training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year, to provide them with the basic skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. TMTI operates under the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute Act 2000. Employment A number of Tuvaluans are employed as merchant seamen on cargo ships on contracts of up to 12 months. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that, as of 2011, there were 800 Tuvaluan men trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimated that, at any one time, about 15 percent of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers. The Ahrenkiel Group of Germany is the shipping company that is the primary employer of Tuvaluan seafarers. The SWIRE shipping company also employs Tuvaluan seafarers. Twelve Tuvaluan sailors were among the crew of 24 of MV Hansa Stavanger, a German container ship that was captured by Somali pirates in April 2009. History In the late 1960s and early 1970s merchant shipping evolved from an industry that involved ship registration and the recruitment of crew in the country of ownership to a multinational industry characterised by ‚Äòinternationalising‚Äô crews, management and ship nationality using flags of convenience. Following the separation of Tuvalu from the Gilbert Islands, Tuvaluans could no more attend to Marine Training Centre in Tarawa. TMTI was so founded, just after independence from Kiribati, in 1978-79 to provide a training school for Tuvaluan men who are interested to be working as seaman, cooks or marine engineers in the international maritime industry with a basic level of maritime qualifications and to provide experienced seaman with revalidation and advanced training to upgrade their skills. The marine school on Amatuku motu (islet) opened in 1981. Development of the training facilities Tuvalu has implemented the 2010 amendments to the Convention on Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1978 (STCWS), which improve training for managing security standards on merchant shipping to address risks such as piracy. In 2002, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved an assistance package to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute. The redevelopment of TMTI was considered necessary to met the competition provided by the growing supply of qualified seafarers graduating from an increasing number of maritime schools around the world and to meet the tightening of accreditation standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The project financed by the ADB involved a jetty extension and installation of specialized safety-at-sea training equipment, installation of a fire fighting facility, expansion of the water catchment and storage capacity, construction of new staff housing, the rehabilitation and extension of trainee quarters and training facilities. This redevelopment of TMTI involved a major replanning of the facilities on Amatuku motu including relocating the fire fighting simulator, the electricity power plant, residential block for the students and building a new double story school block. The workshop complex was renovated and now includes welding booths. A new jetty was built, which incorporates the lifeboat launching davits. The work was completed in 2011. Opportunities provided by TMTI training The TMTI provides Tuvaluan men with eight months of training to provide the basic level of maritime qualifications necessary for employment in the international maritime industry. The 1991 census identified 272 seaman working on merchant shipping. In 2002, the Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) estimated the number as 417 seaman working on shipping. Remittances from seafarers is a major source of income for Tuvaluan families and are estimated to be AUD$4 million each year. However the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 impacted export/import activities with a resulting drop in job opportunities for Tuvaluan seaman merchant shipping. The ADB identify that the number of Tuvaluans employed as seafarers has decreased steadily from about 340 in 2001 to only 205 in 2010; so that of a total pool of 800 qualified seafarers, including those on leave, almost 450 were unemployed. This decline in seafarer employment has reduced remittances from $2.4 million in 2001 to a projected $1.2 million in 2010. The International Labour Organization (ILO) also estimates that in 2010 there were approximately 200 Tuvaluan seafarers on ships. In July 2014, following a joint study by the Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union, the Tuvalu Maritime Services, the crewing agency APNL and the Tuvalu government, the government introduced a policy of reimburse 50% of the airfare between Tuvalu and Fiji. The study concluded that shipping companies were finding that recruiting Tuvaluan seafarers was too expensive and involved delays. The government also negotiated an extra flight a week with Fiji Link so that Tuvaluan seafarers could take up jobs on short notice. Demand for the services of Tuvaluan seafarers The International Monetary Fund 2014 Country Report described the effect of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 as reducing demand for the services of Tuvaluan seafarers. As of October 2013, there were about 112 Tuvalu seafarers working on cargo boats, compared to 361 in 2006. The consequence is that remittances from seafarers to their families in Tuvalu fell by about 9 percent of GDP for Tuvalu. In 2012 remittances from seafarers amounted to 10 percent of GDP in Tuvalu. Tuvaluan seafarers compete with those from Kiribati and South and Southeast Asian countries. There are higher transport costs for Tuvaluan and I-Kiribati seafarers to travel to take up positions of ships put them as a disadvantage as compared to other seafarers. Structural changes to merchant shipping industry have occurred following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 with the industry suffering low profitability and overcapacity. The increasing automation of ship operations has also reduced the demand for Tuvaluan seafarers. The training provided by the TMTI is generally for traditional merchant vessels so that Tuvaluan seafarers need to acquire the experience in technologies used on modern container ships while working on these ships.

The common name for this genus and a group of related genera is \\"ecphora\\"(s).  Etymology  The name \\"Ecphora\\" is Greek, meaning \\"bearing out.\\" The word was originally used by Vitruvius to signify the projecture of a member or moulding of a column, and here refers to the distinctive \\"T-shaped\\" ribs that project from the shell.Oxford English Dictionary, \\"Ecphora\\" entry. Subdivisions As originally proposed by Petuch in 1988, Trisecphora was regarded as a subgenus of Ecphora (sensu stricto), as was the genus Latecphora. However, further study (by Petuch) of these two subgenera lead to their promotion to genera proper. However, Planecphora Petuch 2004 was originally proposed as a full genus, but was then demoted to subgenus. Currently, Ecphora is subdivided into the subgenus Planecphora, and several species complexes.

The petition failed because the U.S. Constitution prohibits the formation of any armed force within the United States and its territories without the authorization of Congress. Puerto Ricans served in the \\"Porto Rico Regiment\\" (later renamed 65th Infantry Regiment) as part of the regular United States Army during World War I, many of which received their military training at Camp Las Casas in Santurce a sector of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Luis R. Esteves, the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the United States Military Academy, helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which would be composed of Puerto Ricans and be stationed in Panama during World War I. It became apparent to Esteves that Puerto Rico was in need of a National Guard. Esteves and various officers took up the matter with then U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico Arthur Yager after the war. Esteves' efforts were successful and with the approval of the Governor and the Insular Legislature, the Puerto Rican National Guard was organized in 1919. In 1919, Governor Yager named Major John A. Wilson (U.S. Army) the first Adjutant of Puerto Rico. The Adjutant is a military rank or appointment. The position did not require that Wilson hold the rank of general. The appointment of the Adjutant of Puerto Rico was the responsibility of the Governor. As such, he assisted the Governor in military matters.BRIGADIER GENERAL (PR) Antonio J. Vicens-Gonzalez Major Wilson served as Adjutant of Puerto Rico until his death in 1938.

It premiered in 2013 at New York University's fourth annual \\"No Quarter\\" exhibition for indie arcade games. A new game inspired by Killer Queen, called Killer Queen Black was released in 2019 on Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch, and will be released later for Xbox One. The game is based on a physical game created by the same people. The game is designed to be played arcade-style by ten players in two teams of five. Two teams, each led by a powerful Queen, face off to be the first to bring the giant snail god home, fill their hive with berries, or execute a triple assassination of the enemy Queen. Gameplay Killer Queen being played at Brewcade in San Francisco Killer Queen is a team-based competitive game for up to ten players (eight players in the Black version). The two teams, Blue and Gold, consist of up to five players each, with one player playing as a Queen while the other players play as Drones. Drones can pick up berries found in the arena and take them to transformation gates. Gates start off unclaimed, but can be turned one team's color by a Queen. Depending on the gate, these transform a Drone into either a Speed Drone, who can move around faster, or a Warrior, who can fly and attack with a sword (or various other weapons in the Black version). Once transformed, however, Warriors lose abilities unique to Drones, such as picking up/carrying berries and riding the snail. Drones will respawn infinitely when killed, but each team's Queen only has three lives, represented by eggs in their hives. The game features three victory conditions that teams must be cautious of: Military, Economic, and Snail. A Military Victory is achieved when the opposing team's Queen is killed three times by attacks from either the Queen or Warriors. An Economic Victory is achieved by using Drones to collect berries and place them in all the holes in their team's hive. Finally, a Snail Victory is achieved by using a Drone to ride a slow-moving snail into their team's goal. The snail will stop briefly to eat enemy Drones, but can move more quickly when ridden by a Speed Drone. Killer Queen Black A home release of the game, Killer Queen Black, was announced for Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows at E3 2018 on June 12, 2018. The game features eight players instead of ten, with a different art style and online multiplayer, along with additional weapons and movesets. The game was released on October 11, 2019, and will be released on Xbox One and Xbox Game Pass at a later date. The game won the award for \\"Game, Original Sports\\" at the 2020 NAVGTR Awards.

The \\"SEC\\" in its name refers to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but OSEC's scope covers all financial regulatory activity. OSEC was formed and developed as an outgrowth and working group of Occupy Wall Street. Among its members are employees or former employees of some of the largest financial firms. They have been described as \\"a counterweight to the deep-pocket lobbying push\\" by financial firms against reform.  History  OSEC was founded in October 2011 as a working group of Occupy Wall Street, the protest movement which started in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan on September 17, 2011. After initially meeting on a bench in Zuccotti Park, late October 2011, the group evolved into a bi-weekly \\"book club\\" at a diner near the park, and then met weekly in the atrium of 60 Wall Street. The group first gained attention after tackling a response to the proposed Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, that would severely limit proprietary trading at commercial banks, similar to the Glass Steagall Act of 1933. OSEC drafted answers to questions regarding the proposed rule, which were included in a 325-page comment letter submitted to the SEC on February 13, 2012.  Volcker Rule comment letter and follow-up  Submitted by OSEC to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2012, the 325-page comment letter was hailed as \\"amazing\\", describing how the authors went through the rule \\"line by line, explaining where it's useless and where it can and should be improved.\\" Others suggested OSEC was doing \\"the day-in, day-out grind of policymaking‚Äîcalling legislators, responding to regulatory agencies, learning the issues...\\" OSEC's comment letter was close to the lengthiest and most detailed of the 16,000 letters sent to the SEC, with the vast majority coming from industry insiders. This letter was cited 284 times by the Federal Reserve Board when the regulations were ultimately put into effect in 2013. On February 26, 2013, OSEC filed a suit in the Eastern District Court of New York naming the Federal Reserve, the SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury calling for implementation of the \\"Volcker Rule\\" (Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010).  Ongoing activities  After the Volcker Rule comment letter, the group continued to engage in regulatory matters where it felt that the 99% needed to be represented. In June 2012, Occupy the SEC submitted a 7-page letter to the Senate Banking Committee prior to JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon's testimony. In December 2012, OSEC submitted an amicus brief in the case of Gabelli v. SEC, in which the Supreme Court will decide when the statute of limitations clock begins for certain fraud actions brought by the government ‚Äì from the time the fraud was last committed or from the time the fraud was discovered. On February 15, 2013, OSEC submitted a formal comment letter on money market fund reform to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The letter urged FSOC to move forward with money market reforms, supported the proposals for floating NAVs and buffers to absorb losses but pointed out that broader reforms were required as well. The letter was cited several times by the SEC when they promulgated reforms to market fund regulations. In July 2013, OSEC submitted an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court regarding overly broad interpretations of securities litigation laws. In September 2014, OSEC submitted an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court in the case of Omnicare v. Laborers Pension Fund supporting the rights to sue securities issuers and their agents for material misrepresentation. In March 2015, OSEC filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Bank of America N.A. v. Caulkett, and Bank of America N.A. v. Toledo-Cardona. OSEC also filed comment letters relating to the systemic risks created or propagated by asset managers to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and in May a letter on designation of asset managers as SIFIs (Systemically Important Financial Institutions) to the global Financial Stability Board (FSB). In November 2015, the group submitted a comment letter to the CFTC on aggregate position limits. They also organized an effort to petition Congress to oppose a bill backed by the Koch brothers. It generated over 1,000 letters.  Reception  According to The Economist, Occupy the SEC's \\"contributions to the debate on regulatory reform (including a tome on the Volcker Rule) have been well- received even by some leading regulators\\".

Almost always, the lights are attached to the mast, which is attached to a trailer, with a generator set to power the lamps. Normally the lamps are metal halide bulbs and the generator is powered by a diesel engine. However, battery-powered, solar-powered and hydrogen- powered sets are available; light towers with electrodeless lamps lighting are also sold. Modular kits permit separation of the generator set, trailer, lights and mast from each other. Another variation is an inflatable mast. Particularly when an inflatable mast is used, the lights may be placed close to the ground, with a reflector attached to the mast. When soft lighting is wanted, an inflatable \\"balloon\\" diffuser may be used. An inflatable mast may serve as a diffuser. Light towers are used for construction. Some purveyors promote their use for other activities where strong, temporary, outdoor illumination may be wanted, such as mining, motion picture production, demolition, emergency services, oil refining, sport or agricultural sectors.

Portability and user-friendliness has added more benefits to this lighting equipment, which is used for a wide range of applications and services like construction and repair of rail and motor roads, lighting for airports, stadium, hotels, resorts, properties, construction sites, search and rescue operations, exhibitions and oil drilling refineries. Apart from these, light towers are also highly useful in applications like construction of military base, highway tunnels, bridges and wind turbines. The efficiency of light towers is measured by certain parameters, which clients should be aware of before buying or renting out a light tower. Most importantly, the high- intensity bulbs should be capable of lighting a vast area without creating any shadow and the generator set should be built in order to provide uninterrupted power supply with sufficient fuel back-up. The pole of the unit should be sturdily built with flexible fixtures and the trailer must be strong, robust and durable enough to hold the entire unit. Benefits Varied industrial sectors often involve in demanding and challenging night time operations in order to complete their projects on or before the scheduled time. Most of the time, workers are required to work under low lit outdoor environments and also poorly lit indoor environments, making their work more tedious, tricky and troublesome. However, the introduction of light towers has revolutionized the way workers perform their tasks at nights and under low-lit conditions. The Portable Light Towers have already been used in rescue operations.

Armenia  According to a 2012 opinion poll, 63% of Armenians perceive Azerbaijan as \\"the biggest enemy of Armenia\\" while 94% of Azerbaijanis consider Armenia to be \\"the biggest enemy of Azerbaijan.\\" The root of the hostility against Azerbaijanis traced from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. = Early period = In the early 20th century the Transcaucasian Armenians began to equate the Azerbaijani people with the perpetrators of anti-Armenian policies such as the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire. Soon afterward a wave of anti- Azerbaijani massacres in both Azerbaijan and Armenia started in 1918 and continued until 1920. First, in March 1918, a massacre of the Azerbaijanis in Baku took place. An estimate of 3,000 to 10,000 Azerbaijanis were killed by nationalist Dashnak Armenians, orchestrated by the Bolshevist Stepan Shahumyan. The massacre was later called the March Days. = During the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict = After the Nagorno-Karabakh War anti-Azerbaijani sentiment grew in Armenia, leading to harassment of Azerbaijanis there. In the beginning of 1988 the first refugee waves from Armenia reached Baku. In 1988, Azerbaijanis and Kurds (around 167,000 people) were expelled from the Armenian SSR.Barrington, p. 230 Following the Karabakh movement, initial violence erupted in the form of the murder of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis and border skirmishes. As a result of these pogroms, Armenians have killed 214 Azerbaijanis and ethnically cleansed Azerbaijanis from all territory of Armenia between 1987 and 1990. On June 7, 1988 Azerbaijanis were evicted from the town of Masis near the Armenian‚ÄìTurkish border, and on June 20 five Azerbaijani villages were cleansed in the Ararat Province. Henrik Pogosian was ultimately forced to retire, blamed for letting nationalism develop freely. Although purges of the Armenian and Azerbaijani party structures were made against those who had fanned or not sought to prevent ethnic strife, as a whole, the measures taken are believed to be meager. The year 1993 was marked by the highest wave of the Azerbaijani internally displaced persons, when the Karabakh Armenian forces occupied territories beyond the Nagorno-Karabakh borders. The Karabakhi Armenians ultimately succeeded in removing Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh. = After Nagorno-Karabakh War = On January 16, 2003 Robert Kocharian said that Azerbaijanis and Armenians were \\"ethnically incompatible\\" and it was impossible for the Armenian population of Karabakh to live within an Azerbaijani state. Speaking on 30 January in Strasbourg, Council of Europe Secretary-General Walter Schwimmer said Kocharian's comment was tantamount to warmongering. Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President Peter Schieder said he hopes Kocharian's remark was incorrectly translated, adding that \\"since its creation, the Council of Europe has never heard the phrase \\"ethnic incompatibility\\". In 2010 an initiative to hold a festival of Azerbaijani films in Yerevan was blocked due to popular opposition. Similarly, in 2012 a festival of Azerbaijani short films, organized by the Armenia-based Caucasus Center for Peace-Making Initiatives and supported by the U.S. and British embassies, which was scheduled to open on April 12, was canceled in Gyumri after protesters blocked the festival venue. On September 2, 2015, the Minister of Justice Arpine Hovhannisyan on her personal Facebook page shared an article link featuring her interview with the Armenian news website Tert.am where she condemned the sentencing of an Azerbaijani journalist and called the human rights situation in Azerbaijan \\"appalling\\". Subsequently, the minister came under criticism for liking a racist comment on the aforementioned Facebook post by Hovhannes Galajyan, editor-in-chief of local Armenian newspaper Iravunk; On the post, Galajyan had commented in Armenian: ‚ÄúWhat human rights when even purely biologically a Turk cannot be considered a human\\".Armenian Newly Appointed Justice Minister Criticized for 'Liking' Racist Comment = Destruction of mosque in Armenia = Blue Mosque, Yerevan In 1990 a mosque in Yerevan was pulled down with a bulldozer.Robert Cullen, A Reporter at Large, ‚ÄúRoots,‚Äù The New Yorker, April 15, 1991, p. 55Thomas De Waal. Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war. NYU Press, 2003. , , p. 79. The Blue Mosque is the only one that remains in present-day Yerevan. In the opinion of Thomas de Waal, the destruction of a mosque in Armenia was facilitated by a linguistic sleight of hand, as the name ‚ÄúAzeri‚Äù or ‚ÄúAzerbaijani‚Äù was not in common usage before the twentieth century, and these people were referred to as ‚ÄúTartars‚Äù, ‚ÄúTurks‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúMuslims‚Äù. Azerbaijanis are being written out of the history of Armenia, and Armenians refer to Muslim monuments as \\"Persian\\", even though the worshippers in a mosque built in 1760 would have been Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty, i.e. the ancestors of Azerbaijanis.  Iran  Anti-Azerbaijani sentiment is rooted in the hostility in 1990s, during which Iran was blamed by Azerbaijan for supporting Armenia in the Nagorno-Karabakh War despite Iranian government claimed it helped Azerbaijan. Therefore, a sense of hostility against Azerbaijan developed in Iran as a result and it ironically boosted alliance between Iran and Armenia. In 2006, a cartoon controversy with regard to Azerbaijani people had led to unrest as the Azerbaijanis have been compared to cockroaches by the Persian-speaking majority population. During 2012, fans of Tractor Sazi, an Azerbaijani- dominated football club, chanted anti-Iranian rhetorics voicing against oppression on Azerbaijanis by the Iranian government and negligence on ethnic Azerbaijanis after the East Azerbaijan earthquakes; the Iranian police force responded violently and arrested dozens. Azerbaijani activists have also faced increasing harassments by the Iranian government for its effort to protect the Azerbaijani minority in Iran. In 2020, during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, anti-Armenian protest broke out in Azerbaijani-dominated provinces where Azerbaijanis demanded closure of border between Iran and Armenia and accused Iranian government of tacit support for Armenia; the Iranian police responded by beating and arresting Azerbaijani protesters. Georgia During Georgia's movement toward independence from the Soviet Union, the Azeri population expressed fear for its fate in independent Georgia. In the late 1980s, most ethnic Azeris occupying local government positions in the Azeri-populated areas were removed from their positions. In 1989, there were changes in the ethnic composition of the local authorities and the resettlement of thousands of eco-migrants who had suffered from landslides in the mountainous region of Svaneti. The local Azeri population, accepting of the migrants at first, demanded only to resolve the problem of Azeri representation on the municipal level. The demands were ignored; later the eco-migrants, culturally different from the local population and facing social hardships, were accused of attacks and robbery against the Azeris,Tom Trier & Medea Turashvili.

August 2007 which in turn led to demonstrations, ethnic clashes between Svans and Azeris, demands for an Azeri autonomy in Borchali and for the expulsion of Svan immigrants from Kvemo-Kartli. The antagonism reached its peak during the presidency of Zviad Gamsakhurdia (1991‚Äì1992), when hundreds of Azeri families were forcibly evicted from their homes in Dmanisi and Bolnisi by nationalist paramilitaries and fled to Azerbaijan. Thousands of Azeris emigrated in fear of nationalist policies. In his speech in Kvareli, Gamsakhurdia accused the Azeri population of Kakheti of \\"holding up their heads and measuring swords with Kakheti\\".

The Georgian nationalist press expressed concern with regard to the fast natural growth of the Azeri population.Mamuka Komakhia. Ethnic Minorities in Georgia . Diversity.ge. Although ethnic oppression in the 1990s did not take place on a wide scale, minorities in Georgia, especially Azeris and Ossetians, encountered the problem of dealing with nationalist organisations established in some parts of the country. Previously not prone to migrating, Azeris became the second largest emigrating ethnic community in Georgia in the early 1990s, with three- quarters of these mainly rural emigrants leaving for Azerbaijan and the rest for Russia. Unlike other minority groups, many remaining Azeris cited attachment to their home communities and unwillingness to leave behind well- developed farms as their reason to stay. Furthermore, Georgian-born Azeris who immigrated to Azerbaijan at various times, including 50,000 Georgian-born spouses of Azerbaijani citizens, reported bureaucratic problems faced in Azerbaijan, with some unable to acquire Azerbaijani citizenship for nearly 20 years.Ulviyya Akhundova.

In 1997, MODE was named the best new magazine launch by Ad Week and Advertising Age. MODE also ran model search competitions in conjunction with the Wilhelmina modeling agency, drawing entries from thousands of hopefuls from the US and Canada. Its circulation was approximately 600,000 at the time of its demise in October 2001. History Publishing veterans Julie Lewit-Nirenberg and Nancy Nadler LeWinter, who had experience for magazines such as Vogue, Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, Mademoiselle and Marie Claire, began developing MODE in 1996. The first issue launched in February 1997 with a circulation of 250,000 copies. MODE received strong positive reception from readers(over 8,000 pieces of fan mail in just over a year) and from the press. After MODE launched, agencies increased their rosters of plus-size models and retailers improved the production value of their advertising. Freedom Publications bought a 50% stake in the magazine in late 1997.

MODE began running model searches in conjunction with the Wilhelmina modeling agency in 1998, drawing entries from thousands of hopefuls from the US and Canada. Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast Publications, made negotiations to purchase Lewit and Lewinter Inc. in 2001, but the deal did not go through. Occurring shortly before the time of MODE closure was the failure of several designers' ventures into the plus-size market. Versace (GV Versatile Couture), Valentino (Carisma), and others ceased producing the clothing which MODE magazine relied upon, leaving an unfortunate deficit in both the fashion department wardrobes and advertising revenue coffers of MODE magazine and its successors. Its circulation was approximately 600,000 at the time of its demise in late 2001.

He contested the citation. Frieman's defense states that the wording of the restrictive highway signage refers specifically to \\"persons\\"; therefore, case law is applicable, going back to U.S. legal decisions from the 19th century, including Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad and to the more widely known 2010 \\"corporate personhood\\" case titled Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Frieman contends that, if corporations are indeed \\"persons\\", then carrying corporate papers in his car allows him to drive in the carpool lane. Stating: \\"Corporations are imaginary entities, and we've let them run wild,\\" Frieman cites the California Vehicle Code, section 470, noting that under the wording of the freeway sign, his ticket for driving in the lane should be tossed out.

The belfry is louvred with a shingled spire, resting on the gabled roof over the main entrance. A key feature of the nave are ten pointed-arch stained glass windows, added at some time after 1895, each set with a different Christian symbol in the arch and dedicated to a different individual or family. The altar was donated in 1899 and features a triptych back. History The village of Richwood and its surrounding area was settled by Irish and German Catholics in the mid-19th century, but the only church serving the community was St. Bernard's in Watertown, almost ten miles away. A Patrick Norton donated an acre of land for the construction of a church, and the cornerstone was laid on July 3, 1864. In 1952, the Holy Cross Fathers who had been administering the parish were removed, and the parish became a mission of St. Henry's in Watertown, then of St. John's in Clyman. By 1970, reflecting a decline in the rural population, the church was deconsecrated and the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, of which it was then part, sold it and its rectory to private owners.

The CST work centers on its eRating vehicle certification program, which is an eco-label for passenger transportation vehicles. The eRating uses a sustainability index which includes factors such as green house gas emissions per passenger mile, emission levels of criteria pollutants, and in certain circumstances factors such as training for drivers and use of endorsed carbon offsets. Once a certain threshold is met, vehicles may qualify for e1, e2, e3, or e4 levels in the certification program. Other key components of the CST's work are online and in person training programs. The CST offers training programs geared to help drivers and organizations eliminate all unnecessary idling and on eco- driving. These training programs are focused on helping reduce environmental impacts, save fuel, and save money. The CST is now actively working with companies in 48 states and three Canadian provinces to prevent unnecessary emissions, reduce environmental impact, and decrease consumption of fossil fuels. This program is not to be confused with the \\"E-Mark\\" vehicle equipment safety certification promulgated by the European Union since 2002 under EU Directive 72/245/EEC and amendments to the requirements of Directive 95/54/EC. History In 2007, the University of Vermont began the Green Coach Certification research project, which sought to investigate what efficiency standards would be best applied to motor coaches to promote greater energy sustainability. Research was conducted on actual motor coach companies. It also researched whether a certification program could help reduce environmental impacts from the motor coach industry by educating operators and executives about the benefits, both financial and environmental, of adopting fuel saving strategies and switching to alternative sources of fuel.Anderson, L., Chase, L., Kestenbaum, D., & Mastrangelo, C. (2011). Ecolabels for passenger transportation: Understanding motorcoach company receptiveness to a pilot green certification program. Journal of Sustainable Transportation, doi: 10.1080/15568318.2011.626889. Upon completion of this pilot program the Certification for Sustainable Transportation was founded as a way to expand the size and scope of the initial program. The CST now works well beyond the motor coach industry, deploying its driver training programs to taxi drivers and school bus operators, and offering its eRating certification to vehicle manufacturers, public transportation industries, and pedi-cab operators. =Accomplishments= The CST has partnered with several leading motor coach companies, including Megabus and Academy The CST also works with the American Bus Association and the United Motorcoach Association to assist with each organization's Green Operator Awards. Certification An individual or organization may submit an application to be certified by the CST. If the application meets the proper criteria, the vehicle being examined is given a score. If that score exceeds a certain threshold, an eRating is given. Areas that are rated include greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile, the use of low emissions technology, the use of alternative fuels, purchase of carbon offset, participation in CST training programs, and the energy efficiency of other places associated with the company, such as the home office. The CST gives eRatings on a vehicle basis. There are four levels of certification ranging from e1 to e4. e1 is the lowest level of certification and means that the vehicle has met the requirements satisfactorily, whereas e4 certification means that the vehicle is at the highest level of energy efficiency. Training programs The Certification for Sustainable Transportation offers two training programs to teach drivers how to be more fuel efficient. =Idle Free= This course teaches drivers about the inefficiency of idling, leaving a bus running while it is not driving, and shows them when they should idle and when they should not. Completing this course gives a driver more points towards a higher eRating. The CST uses a unique approach in this training concentrating on helping dispel myths about idling and helping individual drivers find and identify reasons they personally would like to go idle free. The CST worked with drivers around the country to design this program with the intent of having it come across as drivers speaking to other drivers. =Eco- Driving 101= This course teaches drivers techniques that they can use to cut their fuel consumption on the road, as well as operate their vehicles more safely. Completing this course also gives a driver more points towards a higher eRating.

It was built in 1852 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It was designed by Lucas Bradley. History The First Presbyterian Church was among the first religious institutions to be created in Racine. The church was founded in 1839, two years prior to the official incorporation of the village of Racine. In its first years, it frequently outgrew its established meeting places: first a schoolhouse on Main Street between Second and Third Streets, then the unoccupied upper floor of the town jail. The congregation's first church building was dedicated in February 1843. In 1850 the congregation's pastor, the Reverend T.M. Hopkins, and later his successor Rev. Z.M. Humphrey, solicited funds to construct a larger house of worship on the southern edge of the city. The building's cornerstone was laid at 7th Street and College Avenue on May 6, 1851, and the finished building was dedicated June 10th, 1852. The building was designed in a Greek Revival style by architect and church elder Lucas Bradley. Several women in the congregation provided room and board to the builders who constructed the church. The total cost of construction was totaled at $10,600, on top of the $1,200 paid for the land. The church holds 156 pews, 138 on the ground floor and 18 in the balcony.

Grand Avenue in Beloit, Wisconsin, United States. It was built in 1885 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. St. Thomas is the oldest Catholic parish in Beloit, With with roots going back to 1846, when the parishioners were largely Irish immigrants worshiping in the home of Captain Thomas and Lucy Power, where City Hall now stands. In 1854 the parish built a stone church, in which they worshiped for thirty years until it burned in 1884. Reverend J.W. Ward set right to work raising funds for a new building, partly by giving a series of temperance lectures. The new church was built from 1885 to 1886 on the site of the stone church. James J. Egan of Chicago designed a simply massed rectangular building with a gable roof and a square corner tower, with fine details. The walls are cream brick, with brick buttresses and stone trim. The porches are in Stick style, an unusual choice for a church like this. The windows are tall, with arches slightly pointed, a typical Gothic detail. A circle-within-the-arch motif repeats in many windows. Many buttresses lead up to little towers with gablets on top. The big corner tower has its own corner gablets, then a belfry with a rose window, then a spire reaching 150 feet, topped with a cross. Inside, the auditorium is 118 feet long and fifty-five feet wide, with an arcade of stained glass windows. Behind the altar is another large, elaborate stained glass window. The ceiling is supported by wooden trusses. The church was built by masons Marshall and Sweet, carpenters Cummingham Brothers, and stonecutter A.S. Jackson, all from Beloit.

This model is useful for proving lower bounds of algorithms for data structure problems.  Overview  The cell-probe model is a minor modification of the random-access machine model, itself a minor modification of the counter machine model, in which computational cost is only assigned to accessing units of memory called cells. In this model, computation is framed as a problem of querying a set of memory cells. The problem has two phases: the preprocessing phase and the query phase. The input to the first phase, the preprocessing phase, is a set of data from which to build some structure from memory cells. The input to the second phase, the query phase, is a query datum. The problem is to determine if the query datum was included in the original input data set. Operations are free except to access memory cells. This model is useful in the analysis of data structures. In particular, the model clearly shows a minimum number of memory accesses to solve a problem in which there is stored data on which we would like to run some query. An example of such a problem is the dynamic partial sum problem.  History  In Andrew Yao's 1981 paper \\"Should Tables Be Sorted?\\", Yao described the cell- probe model and used it to give a minimum number of memory cell \\"probes\\" or accesses necessary to determine whether a given query datum exists within a table stored in memory.  Formal definition  Given a set of data S construct a structure consisting of c memory cells, each able to store w bits. Then when given a query element s determine whether s \\\\in S with correctness 1 - \\\\varepsilon by accessing t memory cells. Such an algorithm is called an \\\\varepsilon-error t-probe algorithm using c cells with word size w.  Notable results  = Dynamic Partial Sums = The dynamic partial sum problem defines two operations (k,v) which conceptually operation sets the value in an array A at index k to be v, and (k) which returns the sum of the values in A at indices 0 through k. Such an implementation would take O(1) time for and O(n) time for . Instead, if the values are stored as leaves in a tree whose inner nodes store the values of the subtree rooted at that node. In this structure requires O(\\\\log n) time to update each node in the leaf to root path, and similarly requires O(\\\\log n) time to traverse the tree from leaf to root summing the values of all subtrees left of the query index. Mihai PƒÉtra≈ücu used the cell-probe model and an information transfer argument to show that the partial sums problem requires \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\log n\\\\right) time per operation. = Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching = The exact nearest neighbor search problem is to determine the closest in a set of input points to a given query point. An approximate version of this problem is often considered since many applications of this problem are in very high dimension spaces and solving the problem in high dimensions requires exponential time or space with respect to the dimension. Chakrabarti and Regev proved that the approximate nearest neighbor search problem on the Hamming cube using polynomial storage and d^{O(1)} word size requires a worst-case query time of \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\log d}{\\\\log\\\\log\\\\log d}\\\\right). This proof used the cell-probe model and information theoretic techniques for communication complexity.

The producers of The Petrov Affair reportedly tried to buy part of the script, but were turned down. Carroll took the project Sandra Levy at the ABC and she agreed to make it provided it was done on videotape. If it was shot on film the estimated cost would be $5.6 million but on video it could be done for $3.4 million. It would be shown on the ABC for the Bicentenary.

The film released on 3 May 2013, coinciding with and celebrating the 100th year of Indian cinema and the beginning of a new era in modern cinema. It screened at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2013. Bombay Talkies is the first of three anthology films from Johar, Banerjee, Akhtar and Kashyap, being followed by Lust Stories in 2018 and Ghost Stories in 2020, the latter two being released on Netflix. Plots =Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh= ; Directed by Karan Johar The short film begins with Avinash (Saqib Saleem), a young man, bursting into his house. He wakes his father and pushes him against the wall declaring that he is homosexual and not a eunuch that his parents are ashamed of. He leaves his parents' house, distraught and heartbroken but ready for a new start. He passes a girl at a train station singing \\"Ajeeb Dastan Hain Ye.\\" Gayatri (Rani Mukerji) is married to Dev (Randeep Hooda). Gayatri, who works for a magazine meets Avinash, the new intern. Avinash informs her that he's gay and is shocked to see that it doesn't shock her. They gradually become very close. On his birthday, Gayatri invites Avinash home for dinner. That evening, Gayatri tells Dev that Avinash is gay. Dev seems shocked. During dinner, Avinash and Dev find that they both share a love for old Hindi films and music. Avinash leans over Dev to look at something on the table and Dev visibly reacts. The next day, Gayatri leaves for some work. Avinash goes to her house to meet Dev. He gives him a CD and then invites him to come out (a funny play on \\"coming out of the closet\\"). Avinash takes Dev to meet the little girl who sings \\"Lag Jaa Gale.\\" Dev is shocked. He pays the girl a lot of money and asks her what she plans on doing with it. She says she will buy food for her brothers and sisters. He asks her if she's lying. She curtly replies that she isn't, and that lying is bad. By this point, Avinash is sure that Dev is gay but hasn't come out of the closet. The next day he meets Gayatri who happily informs him that she and Dev had amazing sex the night before. Avinash is disappointed and angry, knowing fully well that he is the reason for Dev's good mood. He goes to meet Dev at work. He admits that he took the one-hour journey between the offices just to meet him. Dev is embarrassed and asks him to leave. Avinash reaches over to hug him sensually, alarming Dev. Dev loses his temper and begins to beat Avinash up. Avinash leaves Dev, and goes back home. The beating he received from Dev triggers the memories of his own father beating him up upon discovering his sexuality. Dev visits him to apologize. He seems torn and after hitting Avinash again and throwing him against the cupboard, he kisses him. Again, Dev begins to hit Avinash. Avinash loses his temper and throws Dev out. Avinash then goes and tells Gayatri that her husband kissed him. Gayatri is infuriated and doesn't listen to anything else Avinash has to say and goes home. Dev enters and tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away and begins to wipe her face. She tells him that she now knows that the there's nothing wrong with her but with him and that he is the reason their marriage failed. She says she's glad she's free now and informs him that their relationship is over. In the final scene we see Avinash sitting on his bed, upset. We see Dev beside the young girl who is singing, Gayatri has kicked him out. And we see Gayatri putting on make up. The film ends on an ironical note. The young girl asks Dev for money and he says that he doesn't have any. She says that he's lying. He replies that he isn't, and lying is bad, mirroring her words from earlier. The irony being, that his whole marriage and life was a lie. =Star= ; Directed by Dibakar Banerjee The story is an adaptation of Satyajit Ray's short story \\"Patol Babu, Film Star\\". Purandar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a failed stage actor, is struggling to make a living after his father's death. His family consists of his wife and his sick daughter, who always wants to hear stories from her father, but is disappointed. Purandar is chided by his wife to find a job, but he expects others to come to him and offer him work. By chance, he gets selected from a crowd to play the role of a common pedestrian who collides with the hero in a scene being shot. When he asks for his dialogue, he is given only one word- \\"Eh!\\". Shocked and heartbroken, Purandar contemplates leaving, but meets the spirit of his stage mentor (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) who reminds him that every role, no matter how small or insignificant it may be, is important if the actor takes it seriously. Purandar goes back to the set and gives his best effort, even incorporating his own ideas, which receives praise. He leaves without taking his payment, feeling a sense of artistic satisfaction. He runs home to his daughter and narrates his experiences, which the little girl enjoys listening to. =Sheila Ki Jawaani= ; Directed by Zoya Akhtar A 12-year-old child (played by Naman Jain) named Vicky aspires to be a Bollywood dancer. Vicky's father (Ranvir Shorey) however wants his kid to follow typically masculine sports, be \\"tough\\" and be a football player. Vicky is a Katrina Kaif fan and loves dancing to \\"Sheila Ki Jawani.\\" When the parents leave the house, Vicky dresses up like 'Sheila' and starts dancing. Vicky is caught when the parents return, and is rebuked for dressing in women's clothes. During a TV interview, Vicky hears Katrina Kaif talk about breaking conventions of society and following dreams regardless of the obstacles that come in one's way, and that sometimes, one must keep their dreams a secret at the start. Vicky is encouraged by Katrina's words. Meanwhile, Vicky's sister wants to go on a school trip but is refused Rs. 2000 by their father because he had already spent funds on the Vicky's football training. She is rather disappointed that the parents are so focused on her sibling's football training when it's clear Vicky doesn't even enjoy football. Vicky realizes how unfair this is, and offers to perform to collect money for her trip. They then decide to organize a small ticketed event for the neighbourhood at an old garage, where Vicky dances to his favourite tunes. =Murabba (Fruit Preserve)= ; Directed by Anurag Kashyap Vijay (Vineet Kumar Singh) is from Allahabad city in UP. The story begins with Vijay traveling to Mumbai to fulfill his ailing father's desire. His father (Sudhir Pandey) desires that Vijay meet Bollywood superstar Mr. Amitabh Bachchan, offer and feed him homemade 'murabba' and bring the remaining half for his father. Vijay's father believes that doing so will bring comfort to him and in turn lengthen his life. Vijay is shown struggling to get personal audience with Mr. Bachchan. Hungry, frustrated and penniless, Vijay even takes up an odd job in Mumbai. Eventually, after much struggling and convincing Mr. Bachchan's security guards, he gets to meet Mr. Bachchan personally. Amazed at Vijay's determination and dedication towards his father Mr. Bachchan happily obliges Vijay. He eats half of Vijay's homemade murabba. Satisfied and victorious Vijay now sets on his return journey by train. On his way back he is shown narrating his experiences to fellow passengers. Meanwhile, a co- passenger maliciously breaks the glass jar containing the murabba eaten by Mr. Bachchan while another co-passenger inadvertently squishes it. Disappointed and heartbroken, Vijay has no option but to replace the piece of murabba somehow. He decides to buy a new glass jar and some murabba. He reaches home with the murabba and offer it to his father. The father however is able to detect that something went wrong; he asks his son, \\"where he broke the glass jar?\\" In response, Vijay narrates the truth to him. It is then that the father narrates his own story to Vijay. Just as he had asked Vijay to meet Mr. Bachchan, his grandfather had asked his father to meet Mr. Dilip Kumar, a Bollywood superstar of his times. His grandfather had handed over a jar of honey to his father and had asked that Mr. Dilip Kumar dip his finger into the jar. However, the jar of honey caught ants by the time it reached Mr. Dilip Kumar and the actor refused to dip his finger into it. Vijay's father had then replaced the jar of honey, dipped his own finger into it and taken it back to his father. Unsuspectingly, Vijay's grandfather ate honey from the jar for years to come and lived a long life. The movie ends with Vijay's father contemplating how life takes a full circle.

The collaboration between four leading directors suggests a confidence that was rare in the industry even a decade ago. I believe that things can only get better from here on.\\" Tushar Joshi gave the film 3.5/5 stars, adding that \\"Bombay Talkies is a format that needs to be praised for its concept. The sequencing of the stories works and the pace is swift, never showing signs of lethargy. If this was a tribute to 100 years of cinema, then we need to have an array of directors from different genres pay such homages more often.\\" Similarly, Sukanya Verma gave the 3.5/5 stars, concluding that \\"Bombay Talkies is an absorbing ode to the language of cinema that is part of our collective system.\\" As for performances, she noted that \\"it‚Äôs Rani Mukerji‚Äôs flawless artistry as an imprisoned soul wearing a mark of normalcy which elevates the emotional core of Johar‚Äôs story.\\" The duo of Banerjee-Nawazuddin creates magic on the screen in 30 mins, adapting Satyajit Ray's short story, \\"Patol Babu, Film Star.\\" Soundtrack The music in this movie is given by Amit Trivedi and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya and Swanand Kirkire. Apna Bombay Talkies is the only song which brings legendary singers of 90s Kavita Krishnamurthy, Alka Yagnik, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and Abhijeet together for the first time that too with veteran singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. The song features all the singers according to the respective actors they have sung most of their hit numbers making this song one of its kind.

During his career, he mainly worked on literacy in both theoretical and applied perspectives, and is perhaps best known for his book Literacy in Theory and Practice (1984). Biography Born in Manchester to Dorothy Groves, a woman from a Russian Jewish background, Street was told his father, an Irish pilot, had died in action during the war. Street was adopted by Margaret Nellie Street and Harry Street; the family moved to Devon in 1945. The elder Street found work in a wool factory, where his adopted son suffered a serious eye injury at the age of 18. Street was educated at the Christian Brothers Grammar School in Plymouth and read English and, for his doctorate, Anthropology at Oxford University; his PhD was supervised by Godfrey Lienhardt. In 1971, he took up a lectureship at the Mashhad University. From 1974, he taught social and cultural anthropology at the University of Sussex, assuming a post as Professor of Language and Education at King's College London and for more than fifteen years he supervised doctoral students and taught graduate workshops on ethnography, student writing in higher education and language and literacy at King's. He spent six months at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988, leading to a permanent appointment as a Visiting Professor in the Graduate School of Education. His summer schools at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil continued until shortly before he died. He retired from his full-time post at KCL in 2010. Meanwhile, he continued an association with Sussex University, via the Mass- Observation archive housed there and research with Dorothy Sheridan. In 2009, he was elected Vice-President of the Royal Anthropological Institute (RAI) and has been Chair of the Education Committee of the RAI since 2006. Later in his career, he became involved in development projects in South Asia and Africa using ethnographic perspectives in training literacy and numeracy teachers in a programme known as LETTER (Learning Empowerment through Training in Ethnographic Research). He also worked with colleagues in Brazil with particular interest in ethnographic and academic literacies perspectives. A collection of papers (coedited with Judy Kalman) concerning Latin America was published in 2012. Academic work Street became one of the leading theoreticians within what has come to be known as New Literacy Studies (NLS), in which literacy is seen not just as a set of technical skills, but as a social practice that is embedded in power relations. Street developed his theory in opposition to leading literacy scholars at the time, including Jack Goody and Walter J. Ong. These, and other scholars, represented what Street called an \\"autonomous view of literacy\\", in which literacy is as a set of autonomous skills that can be learnt independently of the social context. The alternative view Street called \\"ideological\\", since it acknowledges literacy's context-dependent and power-laden nature. Central to Street's conceptualisation of literacy was the distinction between literacy events and literacy practices. The term literacy events was coined by Shirley Brice Heath to refer to situations in which people engage with reading or writing.Heath, S. B. (1982). \\"What no bedtime story means: Narrative skills at home and school\\". Language in society. 11(1), 49‚Äì76. While literacy events refers to discrete situations, literacy practices refers to the larger systems which these events create within a community. Literacy practices are the patterns of literacy events in a society; different domains may have different literacy practices, as literacy has different functions within a society, across domains. Street defined literacy practices as the ‚Äúbroader cultural conception of particular ways of thinking about and doing reading and writing in cultural contexts.‚ÄùStreet, Brian V. 2000 Literacy events and literacy practices: Theory and practice in the New Literacy Studies. In K. Jones & M. Martin-Jones (Eds.), Multilingual Literacies. Reading and writing different worlds (pp. 17‚Äì29). Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company The notion of literacy practices stems from Street‚Äôs fieldwork in an Iranian mountain village, Cheshmeh, where he realised that people used literacy in different ways in different contexts, and for different purposes: maktab, schooled and commercial literacy practices. The uses and meanings of these were different: maktab literacy was associated with Koranic schools, schooled literacy with secularisation and modernisation, and commercial literacy with the fruit trade. The commercial literacy sprang out of the Koranic literacy practices, rather than schooled literacy practices as the dominant view of Literacy might expect and Street explains this by the status and authority the latter practice had within the village. Schooled literacy, on the other hand, although more technically developed, was oriented away from the village towards the cities. It was not the literacy skills as such, but the social functions associated with particular literacies, that influenced the development of commercial literacy in this village. Later in his career Street worked on academic literacy and numeracy, and both areas can be said to reflect and build on his view of literacy. In several articles on academic literacy (most coauthored with Mary R. Lea) Street critiques the notion of academic literacy as a set of skills to give writings structure, content and clarity, and argues that this varies across disciplines, and that what is seen as \\"appropriate writing\\" is more closely tied to epistemologies and the underlying assumptions of different disciplines. The perspective of academic literacies acknowledges and takes into account the power and discourses within institutions and institutional production and representation of meaning. Like literacy, Street (and his coauthors Dave Baker and Alison Tomlin) saw numeracy as a social practice that cannot be reduced to a set of technical skills. Rather, they turn the focus to social factors, particularly the similarities or differences between school and home numeracy practices, and the implications of these, including ideology, power relations, values, and social institutions. Street (and his coauthors) argued that some maths practices are privileged over others, and this has to do with the control and status associated with social institutions and procedures. In that sense, we can adopt a similar approach to numeracy practices as social and ideological that has been developed with regard to literacy. Personal life and honours Street married twice. Firstly to Joanna Lowry, whom he met while an academic at Sussex University; the couple had three now adult children, a son and two daughters, before separating in 1991. His second wife was Maria Lucia Castanheira, a professor at Brazil's Federal University of Minas Gerais, whom he married in 2017. He was awarded the National Reading Conference's Distinguished Scholar Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. Death Brian Street died in Hove on 21 June 2017 at the age of 73 from cancer.

It was built in 1853 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Shopiere congregation was established in 1844 by Reverend Stephen Peet, riding over from Beloit. The members initially met in a log schoolhouse, then in a small chapel which they built at the south end of the church before the church was built. In 1850 they began constructing the main block of the building pictured. That main block has walls of rough-cut locally quarried limestone laid in courses. Its style is simple Greek Revival, suggested by the pitch of the roof, the frieze board, and the entablature in the gable end. The main block was completed in 1853 at a cost of $2,000. The tower at the front was added in the following years, rectangular and wooden with two round-arched windows on the front and an entry door on each side. Resting on the tower is an octagonal belfry, and from that rises a graceful steeple topped with a cross. The style of the tower and belfry are rather unusual for Wisconsin, and may result from some early members' New England origins. In 1871 the tall Gothic-styled pointed-arch windows were added on the sides of the church, and the original chapel at the back was replaced with a new chapel. Louis P. Harvey, briefly governor of Wisconsin during the Civil War, is the most famous member of the Shopiere congregation. Today the church is probably the second oldest continuously used church in Rock County.

SILVIA was developed, and designed to recognize and interpret speech, text, and interact with applications and operating systems, all while interacting with a user. The technology can be run and operate via cloud, a mobile application, a part of network, or via server. Overview =History= Leslie Spring founded Cognitive Code in 2007 and is the inventor and architect of Cognitive Code‚Äôs SILVIA Platform. Prior to founding Cognitive Code, Leslie worked for such companies such as Electronic Arts, Disney, and Sony heading up their software development teams responsible for building graphics systems, 3D game engines, and custom software developer tools. In addition to Leslie Spring, the company's general partners Peter Walsh and John Chen. Cognitive Code received venture capital funding from New York investment firm Channel Mark Investments who went on to become majority owners of the company. The platform was initially released on January 1, 2008. =Features and system requirements= SILVIA was developed to recognize and interpret any human interaction: through text, speech, and any other human input. The platform allows an application of it in all applicable and possible applications which then allows natural and intuitive human interaction. The system also allows easy implementation. It has a complete set of graphical user interface tools which can aid in developing intelligent objects or entities, and has an array of API scripts which can be embedded in any compatible applications. Differentiating SILVIA from other similar technologies, the platform can be used in different computing platforms and operating systems which can seamlessly allow easy transfer of data. Aside from being available in almost all platforms, SILVIA uses a non-command based system wherein inputs are based on normal human conversational language, not on pre-coded commands like what Google's Google Now and Apple Inc.'s Siri used. =Components= SILVIA is composed of several components: * SILVIA Core: A runtime engine which can be configurable for use in any user, server, or mobile systems. It can also be embedded. * SILVIA Server: A configurable system of SILVIA Cores for automated management. * SILVIA Voice: A modular component designed for accepting voice input and rendering voice output. It can be used within an application, web page, or as part of SILVIA server for better optimization of media streaming. * SILVIA API: Is one of the several components of SILVIA wherein programmers are allowed to create applications, and plug-in based functionality. * SILVIA Studio: A graphical system for application-specific behavior development. =Use= SILVIA can be used in several applications, such as: being used in call centers, smart phones like the iPhone and Android devices, and voice search or other voice-related applications. Unlike other similar technologies, SILVIA can intelligently respond to its users, not in one or two words or small phrases but in complete sentences. SILVIA has been used by several companies such as Northrop Grumman. Northrop Grumman used the technology in order to aid the company's employees to much better communicate with computers and mobile devices using natural language. The company also utilizes the technology in the development and deployment of military training applications. \\"SILVIA is also currently being used for training and simulation applications for the US Military. The platform is also revolutionary as it can also be used in gaming through its SILVIA Unity platform, and is currently being introduced for use in toys. Recognition Cognitive Code and its technology platform was included in the list of TechCrunch's TechCrunch40.

The game was first revealed in 2011 via the crowd-funding platform Kickstarter and is separated into five acts that were released sporadically throughout its development; the first releasing in January 2013 and the last releasing in January 2020. The game was originally developed for Linux, Microsoft Windows, and OS X, with console ports for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One under the subtitle of \\"TV Edition\\", coinciding with the release of the final act. Kentucky Route Zero follows the narrative of a truck driver named Conway and the strange people he meets as he tries to cross the fictitious Route Zero in Kentucky to make a final delivery for the antiques company for which he works. The game received acclaim for its visual art, narrative, characterization, atmosphere and themes, appearing on several best-of-the-decade lists. Gameplay The story largely takes place in fictional places based around Interstate 65 in Kentucky and the Mammoth Cave National Park. Kentucky Route Zero is a point and click game that contains text-driven dialogue. There are no traditional puzzles or challenges, with the focus of the game being story-telling and atmosphere. The player controls Conway by clicking on the screen, either to guide him to another location, or interact with other characters and objects. The player also has the choice to choose Conway's dialogue, and occasionally the dialogue of other characters, during in-game conversations. The game is separated into various locations, between which Conway can travel using his truck. A map is shown when traveling on the road, and the player must guide the truck icon to the destination of their choosing, mostly areas where the player has been pointed or sent out to go. The player also takes control of other characters at certain times. Plot Conway, a truck driver, works as a delivery man for an antique shop owned by a woman named Lysette. Being hired to make a delivery to 5 Dogwood Drive, Conway travels the roads around Interstate 65 in Kentucky to locate the address, accompanied by his dog, whose name is chosen by the player. After searching around, Conway elaborates that he is lost and stops off by a gas station, Equus Oils. =Act I= The game opens on Equus Oils, a gas station at which Conway asks for directions. Conway arrives in the Equus Oils station and meets an old man named Joseph, who is the owner of the establishment. Joseph informs Conway that the only way to arrive at Dogwood Drive is by taking the mysterious Route Zero, and then tasks him to fix the circuit breaker to restore power in the station and use the computer to locate directions. Conway goes underneath the station and meets three people who are playing a strange game and ignore him completely. He is able to retrieve their lost 20-sided die but soon notices their disappearance afterwards, clearing a way to fix the electricity. When asking Joseph about the strange people who disappeared, he suggests Conway may have been hallucinating. Conway uses the computer to locate the directions of the M√°rquez Farm to talk to Weaver M√°rquez, who has a better understanding of the roads. As Conway leaves, Joseph tells him that he loaded a TV into the back of the truck to take to Weaver. Conway drives to the M√°rquez residence and meets Weaver. Weaver quizzically asks Conway a number of questions and Conway finally asks her about directions to Route Zero. She has Conway set up the TV and when Conway looks into the screen, he sees the vision of a strange farm and spaces out. When he wakes, Weaver informs him of her cousin Shannon who fixes TVs and gives him the directions to Route Zero, and suddenly disappears. When arriving at the destination, Conway finds the area to actually be an abandoned mine shaft called Elkhorn Mine. He locates Shannon M√°rquez, who has been exploring the mines in search of something she has lost. Conway decides to help Shannon travel deeper into the mine, and begins toying with a PA system to test the depth and length of the tunnels. Unfortunately, the sound waves cause a portion of the mine to collapse. Conway injures his leg from falling rubble, and Shannon uses a track to help them travel through the mine. While exploring the mine, Shannon reveals the mine's tragic history, involving the deaths of many miners due to flooding. If the lamplight is turned off during the travel, ghostly visions of miners can be seen wandering the caves. Before exiting the mines, Shannon leaves Conway and travels a bit farther down the mine shaft, and comes across a heap of miner helmets. She comes back quickly without explaining anything. Conway and Shannon travel to Shannon's workshop, and then back to the M√°rquez Farm, where Shannon reveals that the M√°rquez family's debts had caused Weaver to flee. As Shannon attempts to fix the old TV, Conway looks in again. This time the picture of the farm begins to warp and separate, causing the screen to create an image of the opening to Route Zero and the truck driving down it. =Act II= The characters traverse a forest looking for a doctor. Act II opens with a prelude in which Lula Chamberlain, an installation artist whose work is featured in the Kentucky Route Zero bonus content Limits & Demonstrations, receives a rejection notice from the Gaston Trust for Imagined Architecture. After reading this notice, Chamberlain sorts through a series of proposals for reclaiming spaces for purposes alternate to their current function, such as a proposal to reclaim a basketball court as a dog kennel. Following the prelude, the focus returns to Conway, Shannon, and Conway's dog. The three arrive at a six-story building known as the Bureau of Reclaimed Spaces. In the lobby they are told that in order to receive directions to Dogwood Drive they must first obtain an ingestion notice from within the Bureau. The receptionist suggests they seek out Lula Chamberlain, currently the Bureau's senior clerk. After a series of bureaucratic misdirections, the three manage to meet with Lula. She informs them that the directions to Dogwood Drive are at an off-site storage facility within an old church. Additionally she suggests Conway should seek out Doctor Truman for treatment of his injured leg. At the storage facility Conway chats about hobbies with the caretaker of the building and listens to a prerecorded sermon on the virtue of hard work while Shannon finds the record they are seeking. As they leave the building Conway collapses from his injury, hallucinating about Elkhorn Mine, and Shannon decides their first priority should be to find Doctor Truman and obtain treatment. Upon their return, the receptionist at the Bureau tells the group that Doctor Truman can be found at his house off the highway. The group leaves Route Zero and goes back above ground in search of Doctor Truman. Arriving at the site, the group discovers that the doctor's house has been torn down and replaced with a museum‚Äîthe Museum of Dwellings. While searching the museum, they encounter a young boy named Ezra, who claims his brother is Julian, a giant eagle. Ezra tells them the Doctor now lives in the Forest, and offers to fly them using Julian. The group accepts and after traveling through the strange illusory forest, lands in the woods. As Conway's condition worsens, Shannon helps him continue, and finally locates Doctor Truman's house. Doctor Truman tells Conway his injury is severe but treatable, and prescribes him an anesthetic called Neurypnol TM. Act II ends as Conway succumbs to the drug, causing his vision to grow black and the walls of the house to pull away to reveal the forest beyond. =Act III= Junebug and Johnny perform at the bar The Lower Depths. The Act opens with Conway dreaming of a previous conversation he had with Lysette. The two recall a tragic event involving Charlie, Lysette's son, and Lysette informs Conway of a new delivery to be made, which will be the last delivery of Lysette's antique shop. Conway awakens from the Neurypnol TM-induced sleep at Doctor Truman's house to find his injured leg replaced with a strange skeletal limb giving off a yellow glow. After returning to the Museum of Dwellings to find it closed for the night, Conway, Shannon and Ezra resume their search for Lula Chamberlain in Conway's truck. The three are quickly stopped again, however, after the truck's engine breaks down. While Shannon calls for a tow truck, two musicians, Johnny and Junebug, pass the group on a motorcycle with a sidecar, and after some discussion decide to help the group get the truck moving again in exchange for following them to the Lower Depths bar to watch their performance. The group agrees, traveling to the Lower Depths and talking with Harry, the bartender, who gives directions back to Route Zero. After their performance, Johnny and Junebug decide to accompany Conway, Shannon and Ezra on their travels. Upon returning to Route Zero, the group comes across a large cave dominated by a rock spire, known as the Hall of the Mountain King. There they find various types of vintage electronics in many states of disrepair, including a large amount set on fire. They come across an old man named Donald who appears fixated on a grand computer project involving a \\"mold computer\\" that is enhanced by black mold growing inside it, as well as a piece of software designed as a comprehensive simulation called Xanadu. Donald claims that Lula was one of the people who designed Xanadu along with him, and that she had left a long time ago, but that there may be a way to find her using Xanadu. However, as Xanadu is not working correctly after an apparent sabotage from creatures Donald calls the Strangers, the group must travel to the Place Where the Strangers Come From in order to seek out their help. Conway and Shannon talk to the Strangers off-screen and, after returning with the solution, travel back with the group to the Hall of the Mountain King and fix Xanadu, using it to locate Lula. With Donald's help, she finds directions to Dogwood Drive, and tells the group to meet her at the Bureau of Reclaimed Spaces. After arriving at the Bureau, Conway receives Lula's directions, which involve taking a ferry from the Bureau down a river. While waiting for the ferry, Conway reveals what happened while he was talking with the Strangers - he and Shannon had gone via a hidden elevator to an underground whiskey distillery staffed by odd, indistinct glowing skeletons, identical in appearance to Conway's new leg. While at the factory, Conway is mistaken for a new hire as a shipping truck driver and coerced into taking a drink of a very expensive whiskey, and is subsequently roped into a job driving trucks for the distillery to pay it off. Act III ends with the ferry arriving. =Act IV= Onboard the old Mucky Mammoth tugboat, the characters travel across the Echo river. Act IV takes place on and around The Mucky Mammoth tugboat ferry, as it goes around the underground river known as the Echo. Conway, Shannon, Ezra, Johnny, and Junebug continue downriver on the Echo with boat captain Cate, her assistant Will, and a passenger named Clara who plays the theremin. They make several short stops along the way - at a floating refueling station, a tiki bar called the Rum Colony, a waterside telephone booth, a psychological research facility called the Radvansky Center, and a cypress-covered island rich with edible mushrooms. Cate needs to deliver a package to a telephone exchange located in a flooded train tunnel, but the tugboat cannot pass through the area without disturbing a bat sanctuary, so Conway and Shannon agree to take a dinghy to reach the exchange station. They pass by a monument to the Elkhorn Mine disaster and then through the bat sanctuary. Conway, who has been drinking and whose behavior had become increasingly erratic, sees a boat full of glowing skeletons, similar to those at the whiskey distillery, and remarks that he's been seeing them repeatedly on the river journey. He tells Shannon he wants to take the job at the distillery and pass his delivery truck on to her; she is disturbed by his plan. Shannon delivers the package to Poppy, the lone remaining exchange operator, and when she turns around to re- board the dinghy, she finds that Conway has turned completely into a skeleton, and has boarded a skiff with two other skeletons, departing with them. Shannon continues down the river alone on the dinghy and rendezvouses with the rest of the Mucky Mammoth passengers and crew at Sam & Ida's, a seafood restaurant. They eat and converse with the proprietors, then travel to a neighborhood of houseboats, where Clara gives a performance on theremin. Their last stop is the Silo of Late Reflections, where Shannon, Clara, Johnny, Junebug, and Ezra all disembark and unload Conway's truck. There is no clear path to get the truck from the Silo up to the surface; nevertheless, Shannon resolves to continue trying to make Conway's delivery to Dogwood Drive. = Act V = Act V begins after Shannon and her traveling companions have hauled all of the contents of Conway's truck to the top of the Silo of Late Reflections, which turns out to be a well at the center of an effigy mound in a small town. This town is the location of Dogwood Drive, and much of the town was washed out by a flash flood that occurred while the characters were underground on Route Zero and the Echo River. The travelers meet and converse with the residents of this town, and learn about its history and landmarks, including a graveyard, a library, a waffle restaurant, a hangar and airstrip, and a public-access television station. Both the travelers and the residents weigh whether they will try to stay and rebuild the community, or leave in hopes of better lives. One of the residents, Ron, digs a grave to bury \\"The Neighbors\\", two horses that were fixtures of town life and who died in the flood. An impromptu ceremony is held in honor of the horses; town resident Nikki reads a poem, and Emily sings a song, \\"I'm Going That Way\\". Development In the early stages of development the developers were influenced by the works of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Flannery O'Connor and David Lynch. They also looked at theatre scripts for inspiration, which later helped in characterisation, dialogue, environment design and treatment of space, lighting and movement. It was developed using the Unity game engine. The game was originally released for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, with console ports for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, published by Annapurna Interactive under the subtitle of \\"TV Edition\\", coinciding with the release of the final act. The final act's update also included short interludes created during development, as well as audio captions, adjustable text scale, Steam achievements and localizations for French, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian, Korean and Japanese. Reception Kentucky Route Zero has received positive reviews from critics. GameSpot referred to it as being \\"beautiful and mysterious enough to grip you\\", and IGN called it \\"a damn fine example of what makes the medium of video games so special\\". PC Gamer stated that \\"Other adventures see you decide a character's fate, their successes or failures. Kentucky Route Zero makes a point of asking you to describe their interior instead ‚Äì and, by extension, yourself as well ... A powerfully evocative and beautiful subversion of point- and-click rote, but occasionally opaque and disorienting.\\" The A.V. Club noted that \\"KRZ really is the masterpiece critics have been lauding it as for years\\" and that \\"anyone with an interest in storytelling, existential mysteries, and the way art can reflect our poor and hollowed world should play it\\".. Rock, Paper, Shotgun named Kentucky Route Zero game of the year in 2013. The game has been included on several best-of-the-2010s lists.

It was built in 1880 as a mission church for German settlers and was added to the National Register in 1990. Honey Creek was founded in 1852 as a mission of St. Aloysius Catholic parish in Sauk City, under Reverend Adelbert Inama. St. Aloysious also established Saint Luke's of Plain and Saint Patrick's of Loreta as missions about the same time. Worship was first held at Honey Creek in the living room of Katherine and John George Leidig, with the missionary priest walking 13 miles from Sauk City. By 1862 people were buried in the current cemetery at the foot of the bluff. In 1867 a log church was built on the cemetery's side of the road, but it burned shortly after, and the congregation resumed services in Leidigs' home. With In 1880 the parish built the stone church very much as it stands today, across the road from the cemetery. Its walls are yellow limestone, randomly laid by local stonemasons Kasper Steuber and/or Peter Mettel and Nicolaus Allart. This uncoursed stone is framed by quoins of dressed limestone, and windows and doors are framed in the same. To make the church look more formal, the masons laid lines of mortar over the face of the uncoarsed stone, to suggest cut blocks. Windows and doors have lancet arches, a hallmark of Gothic architecture. Above the centered front door is a rose window, and above that is a square frame belfry with an octagonal steeple, topped with a simple cross. Inside is a single room, with twelves rows of original wooden pews on each side of a centered main aisle. At the front stands a wooden Gothic-style altar built by E. Briemayer of Milwaukee in 1883-84. To the right of the altar is a pot-bellied Jewel-brand stove. Left of the altar is a confession booth. Above it is a four-foot wooden cross, on which is written \\"Rette Diene Seele Mission-1860-1887\\". The first part is German for \\"save your soul,\\" and the last part indicates it was used for mission services even before the church was built. The interior walls are plaster over lathe, then painted and stenciled - all remarkably original. Designs include stars, lattice, tulip shapes and urns. On the east and west walls are fading inscriptions: * Alle Tage deines Lebens habe Gott in Deinem Herzen und Hute dich (Every day of your life have God in your heart and protect yourself) * Ye in eine Sunde zu willigen. Tag 4. (Ye to consent to a sermon. Day 4.) * Wer euch hort der hort Mich. Wer euch verachtet, der verachtet. (Whoever hears you hears me. Who despises you, despises me.) * Du sollst Vater und Mutter ehren. 10 Geb. (You should honor your father and mother. 10 Geb.) * Furchte den Herrn von deiner gauzen Seele und halte seine Priester in Ehren Jes Sirach. 7:31. (Fear the Lord of your wretched soul and honor his priests in the honor of Sirach. 7:31.) * Nirgen ist ein Fehler gefahrlicher als hir. St. Greg. (Nowhere is a mistake more dangerous than hir.(?) St. Greg.) A caretaker's home was built nearby at the same time as the church. The first priest was Reverend Herman Grosse. Services were monthly and initially conducted in Latin. Later the language switched to German. After WWI, services switched to English. The church remained a mission church with services held monthly until 1942. By then attendance didn't justify that schedule, so services were cut back to several times each year. Edward Bender bought the caretaker's home in 1947 and moved it. In 1960 the mission church was closed. The cemetery across the road is backed by the wooded bluff. The earliest tombstone is from 1862. Grave markers include wrought iron crosses, simple slab markers, and modern, machine-cut stones. Names on the stones include Bethscheider, Bliven, Brylla, Conner, Conway, McKenna, Mehan, Mettel, O'Neill, Power and Unterholtzener. The German, Irish and English names are generally grouped in different parts of the cemetery. In 1973 Robert Jaedike bought the church for $1500, giving it to the Sauk Prairie Historical Society in 1975. Today County C still winds around the wooded bluff and between the church and cemetery. The church serves as a wedding chapel and a public museum on summer Sundays.

Maggie and Sophia are young married women who regard the male sex from two opposite points of view, the one having little faith in men's regard for the sanctity of the marriage vow, the other regarding mankind in general, and her own husband in particular, as models of marital constancy. Maggie offers to furnish proof that both husbands are partial to an amorous adventure when it comes their way. From this challenge there follow a couple of little scented notes, written by Maggie's maid, Rebecca, and sent to the respective husbands, suggesting a rendezvous that night at a masked ball at the Cremorne pleasure gardens. The husbands at once succumb to this temptation; they are ready with plausible excuses for absenting themselves and presently, when each meets the wife of the other disguised by a \\"pink domino\\" the complications begin. They go, in the early hours of the morning, to the same restaurant, where each man has engaged a separate private room, and the imbroglio becomes the more confusing when Rebecca, also wearing a pink domino has, unwilling to lose her share in the night's fun, come to the same establishment escorted by a reasonably virtuous young lawyer, who is the nephew of Maggie's prudish and moralising aunt, Mrs Joskin Tubbs. Cosy little suppers are ordered, champagne flows freely, and, with three young women in pink masks, the respective couples become considerably mixed, and Rebecca has more than her share of the attentions of each of the male revellers. The gentlemen, proudly conscious of the triumphs they imagine they have secured, depart for their homes, and with the following morning there comes for each of the truant husbands a startling revelation. Charles, the much-trusted spouse of Sophia, learns that Maggie has been at the ball wearing a pink domino; Percy, the untrusted husband of Maggie, is made aware of a similar fact with regard to Sophia; each man thinks he has terribly injured his friend, and each for a time is prone to painful remorse. Their remorse gives way to astonishment when there is brought in a bracelet found in the restaurant, and known to have been worn by the mysterious \\"pink domino\\" lady. Their astonishment arises from the fact that this bracelet is known to belong to that model of all that is virtuous and proper, Mrs Joskin Tubbs. This mystery, with others of the evening, is cleared up when it is made known that the young lawyer has borrowed some of his aunt's jewellery for the better adornment of Rebecca. Rebecca, to spare her mistress pain, and ashamed to return, sends to the house the domino she had worn at the ball. In this the one husband spies the hole he has burned with his cigar; the other notes the corner he remembers to have torn. In these they find proof positive, as they think, of the identity of the damsel with whom they have achieved a conquest, and, as neither is proud of the adventure, they keep quiet, and are ready to promise fidelity to their accusing wives, who are willing to pardon their faithlessness. Maggie is satisfied with the success of her scheme, and Sophia acknowledges that her faith in man's fidelity was based on a very shaky foundation.

It was built in 1906 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Around 1892, Pastor J.T. Kjollgren organized a Lutheran congregation among the Swedish settlers on the north side of New Richmond. Many of them worked in lumber mills on the north side of the Willow River - especially the Willow River Lumber Company. The congregation was probably called First English Lutheran because it held some worship in the English language. They initially held services in the Norwegian Lutheran Church on North Third Street, renting the space at one dollar per service. With In 1906 the congregation decided to build their own church. They arranged a benefit to raise money for this project, with the Arpi Quartette from Gustavus Adolphus College performing at Hagan's Opera House. Tickets cost from 25¬¢ for children to 50¬¢ for reserved seats. Construction began that same year. The first service in the new building was held January 5, 1907 in the basement, because the roof wasn't yet finished. The general form of the building is a typical small church, with a tower and steeple centered above the front door. The raised foundation is rusticated concrete block. The walls are also cream- colored concrete block, supplied by the B&W; Concrete Stone Company of New Richmond. The windows and door are topped with lancet arches, typical of Gothic Revival style. The front tower is square, with the bottom built of block. On that sits a wooden section of the tower which once held a bell. On top of that is an octagonal spire topped with a cross. Inside, the church has been remodeled into an Anglican style. In 1945 the congregation changed their name to First Lutheran Church, without the English, and merged with Norwegian Lutheran Church. The following year St. Thomas Episcopal bought the old First English Lutheran building for $3,300 and has called it home since. St. Thomas has roots in New Richmond going back to around 1867. They had a church building which was destroyed by the 1899 tornado. After that they worshiped in members' homes for almost fifty years before buying the Lutheran church in 1946. The NRHP nomination considers the building significant as a remnant of the Scandinavian community on the north side of New Richmond. It is also the only old church in New Richmond still used as a church.

Hwy. Y 3 miles south of the junction of Co. Hwy. Y and SR 33 in the Town of Trenton, Wisconsin, United States. It was built in 1856 by a community of Catholic immigrants from the Kingdom of Bavaria. Like many early structures in southeastern Wisconsin, it is made of mortared fieldstone, and is one of four surviving fieldstone churches in Washington County, Wisconsin. The church was served by itinerant missionary priests for the first twenty-four years of its existence. After 1870, the congregation was served by the same priest as the neighboring Holy Trinity Church in Newburg. In the 19th century, the church basement hosted a school where children from the area learned to read and write in German while also receiving religious education. The students were taught by Sisters of St. Agnes, whose order was founded in the Village of Barton, Wisconsin. Originally, the inside of the church had whitewashed walls, but in 1925, the congregation commissioned Milwaukee artist Hans Schmeidl to paint a depiction of St. Augustine behind the altar, flanked by bordered medallion paintings of Mary and Jesus. Sermons and hymns were in German into the 1940s. The church stopped holding regular services in 1985, and the parishioners joined Holy Trinity Church in Newburg. From that point on, the building was used exclusively for holiday services, weddings, and funerals. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

The film stars Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro as aging boxers stepping into the ring for one last bout. Stallone and De Niro have both previously been in successful boxing films (Rocky and Raging Bull, respectively) and worked together in Cop Land. It was previously scheduled for a January 10, 2014 release, but was moved up to December 25, 2013. Plot In their prime, Pittsburgh boxers Henry \\"Razor\\" Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy \\"The Kid\\" McDonnen (Robert De Niro) become rivals after two fights, one in which Kid beats Razor and one in which Razor beats Kid, the only defeats of their careers. Before they have a rematch, Razor announces his retirement without explanation, infuriating Kid and costing them a big payday. Years later, Razor is low on money and working in a shipyard when he is visited by promoter Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart), who wants Razor to provide a motion capture performance for a video game. It was Slate's father whose shady business dealings ended up leaving Razor in dire financial straits. The soft-spoken Razor wants no part of this stunt. Kid, a showoff who runs a bar and a car dealership, is all for it. Razor begrudgingly accepts $15,000 needed to care for his ailing former trainer Lightning Conlon (Alan Arkin) and pay his overdue bills. At the recording studio, Razor is surprised and taunted by Kid, who was also invited by Slate. The two get into a fight and damage the studio before being arrested. Cellphone footage of the fight is uploaded on YouTube and goes viral, giving Slate the idea of organizing a final grudge match between Razor and Kid, which he will promote as \\"Grudgement Day\\". Kid eagerly accepts. Razor is forced to do so as well, not receiving his $15,000 and then learning he has been fired from the shipyard. At the press conference to announce the grudge match, Razor is approached by his ex-girlfriend Sally Rose (Kim Basinger), who cheated on him with Kid during their youth and ended up becoming pregnant. Now widowed, Sally wants to reconnect with Razor, but he is reluctant. Razor asks old trainer Lightning to get him back in shape. Kid expects gym owner Frankie Brite (LL Cool J) to train him, but Frankie mocks the fight and is of little help. Kid is approached by his estranged biological son, B. J. (Jon Bernthal), against Sally's wishes. The two begin to bond after B. J. gives Kid helpful advice regarding his technique, and is invited to be his trainer. Lightning finds out Razor is blind in one eye. A fight could cause permanent damage, so Lightning and Sally both implore Razor to call it off, but he decides to go through with the fight. Kid takes his grandson Trey to celebrate the news that the Grudge Match is sold out. B. J. believes they're going to a movie, but Kid takes the child to a bar, then leaves him on his own while hooking up with a groupie. Trey ends up accidentally starting Kid's car while he is in the backseat having sex. Kid prevents an accident, but he is arrested, and B. J. is infuriated that he endangered the boy. Kid apologizes to B. J. and gives him a scrapbook that he kept of B. J.'s sports career in school, proving he had not been disinterested in him throughout the years. B. J. forgives him. When the Grudge Match begins Kid gains the upper hand, severely beating Razor by unknowingly exploiting his blind eye. Upon learning of Razor's condition, however, Kid stops focusing on the eye and helps Razor to his feet. Razor turns the fight to his favor, but likewise helps Kid on his feet after nearly knocking him out. The fight ends and the judges decide it on points. Razor is declared the winner by a very close split decision. He celebrates with Sally and Lightning, while a satisfied Kid enjoys the company of B. J. and Trey, who are proud of what he has accomplished. In a post-credits scene, Razor has a new TV, on which he and Lightning view a performance by Kid on Dancing with the Stars and quickly deduce that he is having sex with his partner. In another, Slate tries to set up another grudge match between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield. Holyfield refuses several increasingly higher offers to fight Tyson before showing interest when Slate offers Holyfield a role in a fourth Hangover film. Tyson, frustrated by this, approaches Slate angrily before the scene ends.

A trailer was released on September 12, 2013. The climatic fight scene was filmed on location at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh. Reception =Box office= Grudge Match grossed only $7 million in its opening weekend, finishing in 11th place at the box office. Made on a $40 million budget, the film made only $45 million worldwide, making it a box office disappointment. =Critical response= Grudge Match received generally negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 31% based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Grudge Match is sporadically funny but meandering, and its strong cast is largely mired in a plot that's overrun with cliches.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Andrew Barker of Variety wrote: \\"Essentially recasting ‚ÄúGrumpy Old Men‚Äù with the senescent specters of Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta, the result is sporadically amusing, with some chucklesome sight gags and crowdpleasing supporting turns from Alan Arkin and Kevin Hart, yet it‚Äôs all so overcooked that it defeats its own purpose.\\" The Hollywood ReporterJohn DeForeDec 24, 2013 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine wrote: \\"Watching De Niro and Stallone piss all over their most iconic roles provides no pleasure. It made me feel ‚Äì Sad. Sad. Sad.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"The movie only wakes up when Hart or Arkin are on screen (preferably together).\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the film \\"A preposterous, worthless mediocrity. ... Never have I yearned more passionately to climb into my time machine and journey back to before my memory of Raging Bull was needlessly trashed by this incredibly depressing and worthless mediocrity\\". =Accolades= Stallone was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor for his performance in the film (along with Bullet to the Head and Escape Plan), but he lost to Jaden Smith for After Earth. (It was Stallone's 14th bid for the \\"prize\\", a record, which he has \\"won\\" four times, also a record.)

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Sadly, the 1891 building burned to the ground in 2005. New church complex built after the 2005 fire First German's congregation began in 1866, when Prof. H. Kurtz, a missionary from Germany, organized the Erste Deutsche Reformite Kirche (First German Reformed Church) among the German-speaking immigrants in Waukesha. By 1880 the congregation had grown to 190 communicants and was worshiping in a large stone structure built in 1840 to house the Prairieville Academy, which had moved on to become Carroll College. By 1890 First German had outgrown its building, so they decided to tear it down and build a new church on the same site. With The floor-plan of the 1891 building was a 39 by 71 foot rectangular. The walls were wood frame clad in cream brick, on a raised foundation of rock-faced Waukesha limestone blocks. The walls were broken by tall round-arched windows, and separated into bays by pilasters in the brick. At the center of the north end stood a large rectangular tower, with the church's main entrance originally at its bottom. The first stage of the tower was brick, the second stage was a wood-sided lantern, and the third stage was an ornate belfry and steeple, topped with a cross. The style was High Victorian eclectic, with the symmetry and vertical lines drawn from Gothic Revival style, the rustic foundation and round arches from Romanesque Revival style, and the pilasters perhaps from Greek Revival. The architect is unknown. This 1891 building cost $8000. Inside, two rows of pews faced the altar at the south end. Walls were plastered, with wooden wainscoting at the base. Space inside the nave rose to the collar beams, which supported a flat ceiling. Services were conducted entirely in German until around WWI, when they shifted to both German and English. Gradually, use of the German language dwindled. In 1924-25, an annex (chapel) was added east of the nave to handle membership that had grown to 716. H.C. Haeuser of Milwaukee designed it to match the 1891 building, with a bit of Tudor Revival style added - yet another style. At the same time, Haeuser directed renovations inside the old nave. First German added a Wangerin-Weickhardt pipe organ in the early 1900s. In the late 1940s the congregation bought a house at the corner of Wisconsin and Maple for a new parsonage, and the old parsonage was converted to a parish house, and the old garage to a youth cottage. By the 1950s membership passed 1000, and in 1956 a modern-styled brick educational building and new vestibule entry replaced the old parsonage. In 1934, First German's denomination merged with other similar denominations into the Evangelical and Reformed Church, and First German Reformed Church changed its name to First Evangelical and Reformed Church of Waukesha. In 1956 the parent denomination merged with others to become the United Church of Christ, and the Waukesha congregation again changed its name, to Evangelical and Reformed Church of Christ. In December 2005 a fire destroyed the old 1891 building. Little was left, so the congregation built a new church on the same site.

National Avenue in New Berlin, Wisconsin, United States. It was built in 1859 With and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The hamlet of Prospect Hill (now part of New Berlin) was settled in the 1830s, mostly by Yankees from New England and New York. Rufus Cheney of New Hampshire was one of them, and in 1840 he and his wife Ruth invited two other couples to found a Freewill Baptist church, the first such church in what would become the state of Wisconsin. This denomination is a variety of General Baptists with roots in England, and Cheney came from the northern branch founded by Benjamin Randall. The congregation at Prospect Hill grew, with more families joining and with the first baptism in 1843. That same year Cheney started a school in his house for the children of members. In 1845 Cheney was recognized as pastor, though he never took payment. Not all was rosy: records show that in 1845 Cheney made visits to \\"delinquent\\" members, and the next year there was a debate about whether members should drink alcohol. Meetings were held each week in Cheney's home. The congregation grew and by 1858 had raised enough money to build a church. Quincy W. Church, a member of the congregation and son of Prospect Hill's first storekeeper, designed the building in Greek Revival style, following the pattern of some New England churches. Typical of Greek Revival, the building is symmetric across the front, with the main entry door in the middle. On each side is a tall 9 over 9 window, and the corners of the building are trimmed with pilasters with capitals. A frieze and cornice run above the pilasters and windows, and a pediment sits above that on the front. The pediment is decorated with an unusual (for Greek Revival) sunburst pattern formed from weatherboard. Above that, a square louvered belfry rises from the roof, itself topped with a small pyramidal roof. Inside, the walls were originally lath and plaster. Deacon Hiram Hale was determined to have a choir loft, and paid for it himself. It stretched across the front of the building and was originally accessed by curved staircases at the corners of the building. The original church was expected to cost $1200, but Rev. Cheney and Hale added $300 to that. The church has never had running water. Outside and down the hill is a small frame privy, almost hidden in the bushes. Northeast of the church there were also sheds for horses and buggies, but they are long gone. The congregation was strongly abolitionist, collecting food and supplies for the Union Army, including \\"blankets, potatoes, horseradish, home-knit socks, caps and underwear and home made catsup.\\" They were against alcohol, and had their own temperance society. The Ladies Aid Society was organized in 1886, raising money to buy furnishings and a bell for the church and sewing quilts for the Indian Children's Home in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Theodora W. Youmans, who grew up in the church, went on to become a pioneer woman journalist and a leader of the women's suffrage movement in Wisconsin. By 1886 the Freewill Church managed to hire a full-time minister and built a parsonage. The hamlet of Prospect Hill had also grown to include two general stores, two stagecoach inns, four blacksmith shops, a sawmill, a creamery, a post office, a cider mill and grist mill, a planing mill, a school, a cobbler shop, and other businesses. The Freewill Baptists were the dominant group in the little community. But membership declined, with attendance under a dozen by 1895. The congregation at Prospect Hill disbanded in 1925. To maintain the building, the Ladies Aid Society was renamed the Prospect Aid Society and opened to Christians of any denomination. The building was deeded to the new society as long as it \\"never be used for dancing, card-playing, or raffling.\\" The new/old organization installed a cookstove, converted some pews to tables, and hosted dinners, quilting bees, and summer Aid meetings in the building, with proceeds going to charities. The building also served as a temporary home for other denominations.

Description It is an evergreen perennial growing to tall and broad, with cupped leathery leaves and narrow spikes of white flowers up to long, which grow in a shiny, winding manner and constitute the main decorative value of this plant. Cultivation With a minimum temperature of , it must be grown indoors in most temperate regions. Although it needs high humidity, it does not require much care, it is enough with good lighting (without becoming excessive) to maintain the bright and intense colour of the leaves, these together with the stem are fleshy, so they do not need a very abundant or frequent watering. Direct light causes discoloration of its leaves, its average lighting is enough. A popular houseplant, numerous cultivars have been developed, some of which show leaf variegation. In summer, it should be fertilised with liquid fertiliser every fortnight. Pests and diseases In general, it is a resistant plant, although it can have problems with aphids and mealybugs.

Shortly after the waterfall, hedge creek flows into the Sacramento River south of Mossbrae Falls. There is a viewing platform over the river, with a view of Mount Shasta. Access to the waterfall and viewing platform is via a short hiking trail. The trail starts at a small park off the Dunsmuir Ave/Siskiyou Ave exit on Interstate 5.SacramentoRiver.org \\"Hedge Creek Falls Trail\\" http://www.sacramentoriver.org/access_site.php?access_site_id=252 The waterfall is down Hedge Creek Falls Trail. The close proximity to Interstate 5, makes the waterfall a very popular stopping point for passing motorists. Geology and Hydrology Hedge Creek Falls is located on the southernmost tip of a pre-Pleistocene lava flow from Mount Shasta. Thousands of years of erosion, mostly from the freezing and thawing of water trapped in cracks on the basaltic face, has resulted in the sheared appearance at the face of the falls. The cave behind the falls is a normal occurrence in thick lava flows and not the result of splashing water. The water in Hedge Creek Falls comes from the massive aquifer resultant of several volcanic occurrences and not from the glaciers found on Mt. Shasta. Although small, Hedge Creek Falls is full of beauty and awe. Its single crest, or lip, is reminiscent of its larger sister, Bridalveil Fall, in Yosemite. Million Dollar Waterfall Original interstate 5 construction plans called for Hedge Creek Falls to be buried beneath I-5. Local residents complained so bitterly they forced the highway to be relocated further into the hill. The total cost of this relocation was around a million dollars, hence the nickname \\"Million Dollar Waterfall\\". Black Bart Charles E. Bolton, better known as Black Bart, robbed the Roseburg, Oregon to Redding, California stage near Dunsmuir on October 25, 1879. Evidence found at the time indicated that Bart hid in the shallow cave behind the falls prior to the holdup. This was one of three holdups committed by Black Bart in this area. Normally he operated much further south.

History The first NCAP was created in 1979, by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This program was established in response to Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, to encourage manufacturers to build safer vehicles and consumers to buy them. Over time, the agency improved the program by adding rating programs, facilitating access to test results, and revising the format of the information to make it easier for consumers to understand. NHTSA asserts the program has influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings. The first standardized, 35 mph front crash test was May 21, 1979, and the first results were released October 15 that year. The agency established a frontal impact test protocol based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (‚ÄúOccupant Crash Protection‚Äù), except that the frontal 4 NCAP test is conducted at , rather than as required by FMVSS No. 208. The European program, Euro NCAP, was founded in 1997 by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport and backed by several European governments, as well as by the European Union. Based in Brussels, Belgium, the European program was modeled on the American program. Other areas with similar programmes include Australia and New Zealand with ANCAP, Latin America with Latin NCAP and China with C-NCAP. The Bharat New Vehicle Safety Assessment Program is being planned for India. In the 2000s, the American agency sought to improve the dissemination of NCAP ratings and as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA‚ÄìLU).

These include Anaren Microwave, Syracuse, NY; Anaren Ceramics, Salem, NH; MS Kennedy, Syracuse, NY; Unicircuit, Littleton, CO; and Anaren Communications, Suzhou, China. History Anaren was founded by Hugh A. Hair and Carl W. Gerst in 1967. Both were RF engineers who left General Electric to focus on a new company that would develop several new RF technologies, including the circuit-etching technologies called stripline manufacturing. The company started with a few dozen employees and a small facility in Syracuse, New York and its first customers were many manufacturing firms in the U.S. defense and aerospace sector including Hughes, Litton Industries (now part of Northrup Grumman), and Raytheon. Contracts and assignments secured during the company's early years included: a microwave landing system for jetliners funded by the United States Department of Defense under FAA supervision; \\"wideband microwave tracking receivers\\" for use in direction-finding systems; and the company‚Äôs first DFD (digital frequency discriminators) and ESM (electronic support measures) to help fighter jets and seaborne vessels detect, identify, and elude the radar signals of hostile craft. The company originally built custom solutions, many of which later became commercial products. In contrast to the smaller volumes of the custom products, these commercial products were marketed by the company on a larger, high-volume scale. The Cold War arms race drove the bulk of business over the company‚Äôs first decade. By 1981, the company had grown to around 200 employees, achieved sales over $8,000,000, and required more space, which led to the construction of its current headquarters campus in East Syracuse, New York. With the decline of Cold War spending in the mid-1990s, the company diversified from the defense market by entering the commercial wireless infrastructure market with its Xinger-brand surface mount (SMT) component family, which included hybrid couplers, directional couplers, and power dividers. Shortly thereafter, the company established two operating groups: a Space & Defense Group focused on the company‚Äôs traditional military and aerospace customers, and a Wireless Group focused on wireless infrastructure customers including operators of Cellular networks. Although the company's Wireless Group was created to meet the needs of the wireless base-station market, later generations of passive components have become small enough to be used in mobile electronics.Richardson RFPD Introduces 400W SMT Hybrid Coupler And Matching Termination From Anaren The newer subminiature Xinger line of passive components are used in consumer devices such as cell phones, PDAs, wireless laptops, WLANS, Bluetooth applications, and set-top boxes.

Polk commanded the 4th North Carolina Regiment in the Battle of Brandywine. In 1786, Polk was elected by the North Carolina General Assembly to the Congress of the Confederation, but did not attend any of its sessions. Polk was a great-uncle of the 11th President of the United States, James K. Polk. Early life and War of the Regulation Polk was born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania around 1732 to William and Margaret Taylor Polk. His father was of Scotch-Irish descent, and had been born in the Province of Maryland. In 1753, Polk moved to Anson County, North Carolina. In 1755, he married Susanna Spratt, with whom he would have eight children. In 1765, Polk participated in the War of Sugar Creek, in which local settlers took up arms against large private landholders who were speculating on real estate in the area of what is now Charlotte. During that conflict, speculator Henry McCulloh attempted to have a large tract of land that had been granted to him by the Crown surveyed and subdivided. The settlers in Anson County objected, as McCulloh sought to interfere with what they considered their established rights in the land. During the confrontation into the settlers and the land agents, McCulloh attempted to evict Polk from his home. Polk and his supporters intimidated McCulloh's land officers and surveyors to the point that McCulloh allowed the rights to a portion of his lands to revert to the Crown by 1767. The settlers were not, however, ultimately successful, and many, including Polk himself, purchased land from McCulloh or were otherwise bribed into cooperation. Polk was also given a position as a commissioner for the new town of Charlotte due to McCulloh's influence, and served as McCulloh's land agent in the newly created Mecklenburg County. Charlotte had been founded at the crossroad of a small trail with the Indian Trading Path near where that great thoroughfare entered the lands occupied by the Catawba people. Polk's homeplace sat near the center of that community. Polk served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1766 to 1771. During the War of the Regulation, Polk was appointed a captain of militia by Governor William Tryon as part of the governor's strategy to recruit prominent Presbyterians to his side against the Regulators, many of whom had backgrounds in Presbyterian congregations. Polk's position as an assemblyman allowed him to take advantage of financial rewards after the defeat of the Regulator movement. In 1772, Polk surveyed the border between North and South Carolina. American Revolutionary War Polk was among the residents and officials of Mecklenburg County who drafted and adopted the Mecklenburg Resolves on May 31, 1775, which called for a reorganization of colonial government and declared laws enforced by the Crown null and void. Polk was then elected a member of the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress, which established a government in the absence of Royal Governor Josiah Martin. In late 1775 Polk participated as a colonel of Patriot militia in the Snow Campaign, which sought to suppress Loyalist recruiting in the South Carolina Upcountry. Polk was then appointed colonel of the 4th North Carolina Regiment of Continental Line and marched north in early 1777. Polk and his unit fought at the Battle of Brandywine and wintered at Valley Forge with General Washington's main army. In September 1777, with British forces about to occupy Philadelphia, Polk was assigned to escort a baggage train containing the city's bells, including the Liberty Bell, from Philadelphia to safety in Allentown. By February 1778 Polk returned to North Carolina to recruit more soldiers for the Continental Army, but by June 26 he had resigned his commission, aggrieved at being passed over for promotion to brigadier general after the death of General Francis Nash. He lost his command of the 4th North Carolina Regiment when, in a reduction of forces, it was combined with the 2nd North Carolina Regiment. In mid‚Äì1780 Polk again accepted a commission with the Continental Army, this time serving as commissary general of purchases for both the state of North Carolina and the Continental Army in the southern theater. When Nathanael Greene assumed command of the Continental Army in the southern theater, he met with Polk for an extended time on the general's first night in the army's camp in order to become familiar with the region's resources. Polk also acted as commissary for the Salisbury district, one of North Carolina's militia recruiting divisions, often using his personal assets and credit to provide supplies for the Patriot cause. When controversy arose over the propriety of his practices in obtaining supplies and credit, he again resigned, but continued to work with General Greene, who appointed him a brigadier general in early 1781. The North Carolina General Assembly refused to approve the commission and appointed him a \\"colonel commandant\\" instead. Polk declined the appointment, citing his age and family responsibilities. Summary of service record: * Colonel over the Mecklenburg County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1775) * Colonel over the 2nd Battalion of Salisbury District Minutemen, North Carolina State troops (1775-1776) * Colonel over the 4th North Carolina Regiment, Continental Line (1776-1778) * Commissary General for the North Carolina Line (1780) Political life after the Revolution In 1783 and 1784, Polk was elected to the North Carolina Council of State, which assisted the governors in performing their executive duties. In 1786, the General Assembly elected Polk as a delegate to the Third Continental Congress, by that time known as the Congress of the Confederation, but Polk did not attend any of that body's sessions. Polk's home accommodated President George Washington overnight during his 1791 tour of the southern states.

It is the emblem and symbol of the Government of Chandigarh and symbolizes \\"the hand to give and the hand to take; peace and prosperity, and the unity of mankind\\". The largest example of Le Corbusier's many Open Hand sculptures, it stands high. The metal structure with vanes is high, weighs , and was designed to rotate in the wind.  Symbolism  The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte) in Chandigarh is a frequent theme in Le Corbusier's architecture, a symbol for him of \\"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive\\". Le Corbusier also stated that it was a recurring idea that conveyed the \\"Second Machine Age\\".  Location  The Open Hand is located in Sector 1 in the Capitol Complex of Chandigarh, on the backdrop of the Himalayan Shivalik hill range.  Background  The Open Hand Monument Le Corbusier thought of the Open Hand Monument first in 1948, \\"spontaneously, or more exactly, as a result of reflections and spiritual struggles arising from feelings of anguish and disharmony which separate mankind and so often create enemies\\". His passion for the hand had an important role in his career beginning from the age of seventeen-and-a-half, when he picked up a brick, a gesture which led to millions of bricks being laid in later years. Jane Drew felt that the symbol of Le Corbusier's philosophy should be made evident to the people of Chandigarh. Le Corbusier then perceived it as a sculptural monument to be erected in Chandigarh, the city he is credited with planning, designing, and implementing. One of his associates, Jerzy Soltan, a member of his atelier, had deliberated with him as to the type of hand to be made ‚Äì whether an open hand or a fist holding a fighting device. The Open Hand became a public project rather than a private symbol when Le Corbusier planned it for the city of Chandigarh, where his associate and cousin Pierre Jeanneret was then working as chief architect and town planning advisor to the Government of Punjab, and was supervising the construction of Chandigarh. In case his preference for Chandigarh to erect the sculpture was not accepted, he had thought of an alternate location: the top of the Bhakra Dam, the high dam in Nangal in Punjab. He had planned to erect the Open Hand against the scenic background of the Himalayas. He called the location he had selected the \\"Pit of Contemplation\\" (Fosse de la Consideration). The design was a huge elevated object (a wind vane), which was an \\"inspirational symbol of humanity unarmed, fearless, and spiritually receptive\\". Le Corbusier had discussed this project with the then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru when he had visited India in 1951. He had also written to Nehru, saying that since 1948 he had been obsessed with this symbol of the Open Hand which he wished to erect at the end of the capital (Chandigarh) in the foreground of the Himalayas. Nehru had concurred with the concept. In his letter to Nehru, Le Corbusier expressed a view that it could also become a symbol of the Non Aligned Movement (NAM), an idea that Nehru mooted although ultimately it was not adopted for NAM. Later, for Le Corbusier, the project had remained linked with Nehru, and on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Nehru's birth in 1964, he was invited to submit something for a \\"celebratory volume\\". Le Corbusier forthwith sketched his concept of the Open Hand, for it was his recurring dream which had obsessed him for six years (prior to 1954). In the sketch, he conceived the Open Hand as a high sculpture which would rotate with the wind and would shine with colours such as yellow, red, green, and white in the foreground of the mountain range. Above the sketch he inscribed, \\"La Fin d'un monde\\" (The End of a World). In spite of his personal relations with the highest echelons of the Government of India, Le Corbusier faced the problem of finding funds for this \\"Utopian symbol of peace and reconciliation in a poor and remote though spiritually rich province\\". He then appealed to Andr√© Malraux to get it made as a gift of France. He even appealed to his friends in India to get his project through. In spite of these efforts, it was twenty years after his death in 1965 that the Open Hand, his dream project, was realized in 1985. It was built adjoining the location which had been intended for the governor's residence but which was later replaced by Le Corbusier's Museum of Knowledge.  Features  The Open Hand sculpture is high above a trench of . The metal wind vane, which is erected over a concrete platform, is in height and weighs 50 tons; it appears like a flying bird. The sculpture was hand-cast in sheet metal at the Bhakra Nangal Management Board's workshop at Nangal. The surface of the vane is covered with polished steel and is fitted over a steel shaft with ball bearings to facilitate free rotation by the wind.

The 722-bed hospital has featured combined public and private services since 1996. In March 2013, the new Joondalup Private Hospital opened next to the existing hospital, within the same campus. The public and private hospitals share the emergency department, operating theatres and intensive care facilities. The hospital's campus is now run by Ramsay Health Care, which also operates Attadale Private Hospital, Glengarry Private Hospital, Peel Health Campus and Hollywood Private Hospital. History On 24 April 1996, then Health Minister Kevin Prince announced an expansion of the old Wanneroo hospital into a health campus. The tender to operate the facility was won by HealthCare Australia while the facility would be built by John Holland. The agreement to operate would last for twenty years. The agreement would provide care for both public and private patients with the current 84-beds increase to 330-beds of which 70 would be private beds. It would provide for an upgraded emergency service, 25-bed psychiatric services, aged care restorative unit, improved surgical, medical and obstetric services, expanded intensive care and coronary care, a 26-bed day surgery and endoscopic unit and a 24-bed paediatric unit, day oncology, renal dialysis, St John Ambulance depot, a medical centre, community health centre and hydrotherapy pool. The state government would spend $50 to $84 million on the expansion and would take 20 months. The state government would save the taxpayer $22 million over the contract period. The new emergency department was opened on 4 June 1997 by Health Minister Kevin Prince. The emergency department was expanded from a 5-bed unit to a 17-bed unit. In July, the west wing with its eight new birthing suites opened and a renal dialysis unit would open, after a staffing delay, on 9 September 1997. A north wing and theatres will open later in the year. The rest of the planned upgrades were completed in early 1998. In January 1998, a new intensive and coronary care unit opened as did a 24-bed paediatric ward. In late January 1998, a new 26 bed restorative unit, a 25-bed mental health service and a hydrotherapy pool were opened. The Joondalup Health Campus would officially open on 11 March 1998 by Premier Richard Court. In March 2003, Health Minister Bob Kucera announced that a $1.35 million Dental Clinic would be built at the Joondalup Health Campus. It would be a ten-chair clinic employing 24 staff members with construction starting in September 2003 and the completion date was March 2004. A new after-hours Clinic opened at the Joondalup Health Campus in September 2004. The aim was to relieve the emergency department from treating minor ailments. On 9 November 2009, a sod-turning ceremony was held at the Joondalup Health Campus that would see $317 million spent on upgrading the facilities at the hospital and see its size doubled. Ramsay Health would provide $90 million to a new private hospital with the rest of the money provided by the state government. Public beds would be increased to 451 from 280 beds, increased emergency department, new operating theatres and a 20-bed dialysis ward. Work was expected to be completed by 2013. Expansion continued and on 3 March 2011, a $29 million Emergency Department was opened with a total of 56 bays and separate areas for adults and children. A new public ward was opened worth $20.8 million and saw 55 new beds which included 51 single rooms, some with courtyards and two double bedrooms. On the 8 March 2012, Health Minister Kim Hames opened a new theatre block which included 12 new operating theatres. Seven opened immediately and the rest opened September of that year. Other facilities opened included a nine-bed intensive care unit, a six-bed high dependency unit and a ten-bed coronary care unit. The $394 million expansion was funded by the State Government who contributed $230 million, Ramsay Health contributed $163 million while the Federal Government contributed $1.4 million. On 6 June 2013, Health Minister Kim Hames opened the new private hospital at the Joondalup Health Campus. The development saw 145 new beds in the private wing and freed up 26 beds in the public wards. In June 2016, a $12.1 million Telethon Children's Ward open that expanded the beds from 24 to 37 beds and includes a giant aquarium, interactive play floors and an outdoor play space for children. Contributions for the expansion came from the WA Government, Telethon and Ramsey Health Care. During 2017, the JHC saw 100,000 people pass through the emergency department and the hospital saw 30,750 surgical procedures. Joondalup Health Campus opened a $7.1 million Mental Health Observation Area, adjacent to the emergency department in February 2018. Partially funded by Ramsey Health Care, the ten-bed area is made up of 4 bedrooms, 6 patient bays, a lounge, secure courtyard and waiting area. It was built by ADCO, and construction had started in 2017. In the WA 2018/19 State Budget, the Joondalup Health Campus has been allocated $158 million to add eight new operating theatres, 6 bed stroke unit, further expansion of the emergency department, more 90 inpatient and 75 mental health beds, 3 new cardiac catheter laboratories, a 25-bed Coronary Care Unit, urgent care clinic and a Medihotel. Health Minister Roger Cook said a Medihotel, earmarked for the Joondalup Health Campus, aimed to assist regional patients to access to the hospital system.

It was designed to complement the Boskone, the Boston Science Fiction Convention, playing in Boston that same weekend. Sunday February 15, 1976 was the inaugural program. It featured \\"This Island Earth,\\" \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" \\"Things to Come,\\" \\"The Thing from Another World,\\" \\"Them!,\\" and \\"Zardoz.\\" Tickets for the 14 feature film event cost $4.75 with a complimentary champagne toast at the conclusion.

Mugineic acid is closely related to its biochemical precursor, nicotianamine, and to a number of other compounds that also have been identified as phytosiderophores in graminaceous plants: 3-hydroxymugineic acid, 2'-deoxymugineic acid, avenic acid, and distichonic acid. The effectiveness of mugineic acid under iron-deficient conditions is dependent not only upon the iron chelating properties of the Fe-mugineic acid complex itself but also upon the presence of a plant membrane carrier that recognizes and absorbs the Fe-mugineic acid complex almost exclusively.http://www.soils.wisc.edu/~barak/images/mug_frm.htm  References   External links  * Category:EC 1.14.11 ","title":"Mugineic-acid 3-dioxygenase"},{"id":"38351336","text":"Acacia caerulescens, commonly known as limestone blue wattle, Buchan blue or Buchan blue wattle is a tree species that is endemic to south eastern Australia Description The tree grows to between in height and has a pyramidal habit with glabrous branchlets that have a fine white powdery coating.

Not distinguishing between different sects of Buddhism, TBA places an emphasis on spreading the right views of the Dharma. The mission statement is to adopt and practice Buddha's teachings of loving kindness, compassion, joyfulness, and serenity in our daily lives for the benefit of ourselves and others; and to cultivate the wisdom necessary for clear understanding of both the universe and the human spirit. With multiple monastics and a large lay congregation, TBA is now one of the largest Buddhist associations in the United States, with its 515-acre American Bodhi Center in Waller County, Texas one of the largest by area Buddhist facilities in the country, comparable with the nearby 500 acre Chung Tai International Retreat Center Texas Pagoda Chan Monastery in Shepherd, Texas, the 400 acre Deer Park Monastery in Escondido, California, and the 700 acres of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Ukiah, California. History TBA was founded in 1979 by a group of lay Buddhists under the guidance of Venerable Wing Sing, Venerable Jan Hai, and Venerable Hung I. The first center, Buddha's Light Temple (‰ΩõÂÖâÂØ∫), was completed in 1984 in the Almeda area of southeastern Houston. However, the Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and other Asian communities were largely closer to the Bellaire area of south-west Houston, and in 1989, the Jade Buddha Temple was constructed in that area to be closer to the core constituency. Over the years, TBA continued expansion to become one of the largest Buddhist institutions in the southern United States, with over 1500 participating families as of 2005. In addition to Chinese-based services, Buddhist courses and meditation classes in English were added to appeal to the more diverse membership. Various community service outreach activities were also emphasized. Invited notable monastics and prominent Buddhist leaders from countries such as India and Singapore as well as from across the United States, such as Venerable Thubten Chodron, also visit to give guest lectures. In 2000, TBA officially began planning for the American Bodhi Center, the first phase of which was completed in 2008. TBA has adapted American practices ‚Äì such as having a lay board oversee administrative and financial duties, and having pew-style seating in one of the main halls - with the traditional Eastern customs of historic Buddhist temples.  Jade Buddha Temple  Áéâ‰ΩõÂØ∫ * 6969 Westbranch Dr, Houston, TX 77072 Construction on the two and a half acre Jade Buddha Temple was completed in 1990, and the Jade Buddha Temple has served as headquarters for the TBA since then. On June 2, 1990, the inaugural ceremony of the Jade Buddha Temple, Texas State Representative Robert Eckels proclaimed June 2 as ‚ÄúTexas Buddhism Day‚Äù on behalf of Governor Bill Clements.The Complete Guide to Buddhist America. Don Morreale, Shambhala Press, March 1998. Currently, the complex consists of the Grand Buddha Hall (which can seat 500), Kwan-Yin Meditation Hall, the Youth Activity Center, a library with a large Chinese and English collection of Buddhist literature from varying traditions, a cafeteria, several living quarters, and a lotus pond with a statue of Kwan-Yin as its centerpiece. In addition to serving the religious and spiritual needs of its members, the Temple functions as a Buddhist study and research center for several educational institutions, including the University of Houston, Rice University, the University of Texas, and St John's School. As of 2013, the temple is open daily to the public from 10am-5pm, and frequently hosts special events for Buddhist holidays. A typical Sunday schedule has dharma-talks in Mandarin in the Grand Buddha Hall from 10am-12pm, with English-language meditation sessions and dharma-talk in the Kwan Yin Hall from 9-11am. Smaller classes and weekly discussion groups meet at different times during the week. There are daily morning and evening chanting services, but advance registration may be needed as those can occur outside of public hours. As of 2011, many of the Mandarin and a few of the English lectures can be watched online. American Bodhi Center The American Bodhi Center (), a property located in unincorporated Waller County, near Hempstead, is a part of the TBA. It includes log houses, dormitories, and a meditation hall. In 2009 Zen T. C. Zheng of the Houston Chronicle stated that it is one of the United States's largest Buddhist developments.Zheng, Zen T.C. \\"A Texas starting place on Buddhism's path.\\" Houston Chronicle. July 30, 2009. Retrieved on May 3, 2014. After 20 years of spreading the dharma in the South, TBA began planning for a long-term center integrated with the local community and serving the public‚Äôs needs. In 2001, TBA purchased 515 acres of land in Waller County, a 49-mile / 55-minute drive from the Jade Buddha Temple in Houston. The official grand opening of the American Bodhi Center was held on May 2, 2009, the 2553th birthday of Shakyamuni Buddha. The center was built with local contractors and with environmentally friendly design in consideration. Rare original relics of Shakyamuni Buddha may be seen at ABC. Other organizations are welcome to use the site for appropriate activities as well. Currently, the American Bodhi Center consists of: * Meditation Hall, the main building of ABC, which houses a Gandharan style Shakyamuni Buddha statue and a wooden Bodhisattva statue dated back to the Ching dynasty * Dining facility and Dormitories * Samadhi Houses, for members who would like to live at ABC for longer periods of time or for retreats * Organic Garden and Bamboo Grove * Sun Moon Lake * Wanshou Memorial Park, with a Gratitude Tower / Memorial Hall. Inside are four halls: Hai Huei Hall, Fu Shou Hall, Zhi Du Hall, and An Yang Hall, each with an Amida Buddha statue. Ashes of the deceased can be respected in the columbarium of each hall. Bodhi Chinese Language School Ëè©ÊèêÂ≠∏Ëãë The Bodhi Chinese school offers weekend classes for children and teenagers to learn Chinese language, as well as cultural activities such as calligraphy, yoga, SAT preparation, and music. It is housed in the two story Youth Activity Center behind Jade Buddha Temple. Courses are grounded in the Buddhist principles of compassion and morality. Youth summer camps incorporate a different topic each summer, for example, \\"Cherish the Environment\\". Bodhi scholarships (around 12 students per year) are also offered for those promising college-bound students who need financial aid. Dharma Garden (Publication) ‰ΩõÂÖâÊ≥ïËãë Dharma Garden is a primarily Chinese- language journal containing both introductory and practical, as well as more academic articles, on various facets of Buddhism. It has been published bimonthly since 1979, and issues since 2008 are available to read for free online as well.

Bichinashvili made his official debut for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he placed second in the three-person preliminary pool of the men's 85 kg class, against Macedonia's Mogamed Ibragimov, and Japan's Tatsuo Kawai. Shortly after the Olympics, Bichinashvili moved to his another adopted nation Germany, where he applied and obtained a dual citizenship in order to compete internationally for wrestling.

Peter Joseph Hurth, C.S.C., S.T.D. (30 March 1857 ‚Äì 1 August 1935) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, a diocesan bishop in British India and the Philippines, and a titular archbishop. Early years Peter Joseph Hurth was born on 30 March 1857 in Nittel, Prussia (now Germany), across the Moselle River from Luxembourg. At that time, Nittel was in the Rheinprovinz, but today it belongs to the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Peter was the youngest of three children of Peter Hurth (1822‚Äì1873) and his wife, Susanna Wolf (1816‚Äì1894).(de) Heinrich Wagner, Familienbuch Nittel hit den Filialen K√∂llig, Onsdorf 1747‚Äì1899 [Book of Families of Nittel with the Dependencies of K√∂llig, Onsdorf, 1747‚Äì1899] (Nittel, Germany: Author, 1993), page 193, Family No. 725. Since 1747, when the Catholic parish registers of Nittel began, the surname Hurth went through various spellings ‚Äì Hord, Hurt, Hurd, Horth, Hurdt, and Hourdt. The future Archbishop was baptized as Peter Hurt. Joseph was later added as his middle name. In the spring of 1874, three days before his 17th birthday, he left for America.Ibid. Peter left Nittel on 27 March 1874, three days before his 17th birthday. Because he was still a minor, he had to get the permission from his mother for his emigration.

There he also joined the Congregation of the Holy Cross (C.S.C.). As a Brother, he worked as an assistant instructor of the Latin and Greek languages at the University. On 30 March 1880 he was ordained to the priesthood. He also graduated from the University. Only one of his degrees was known to be a S.T.D. He had it by 1908, when he wrote an article for an American encyclopedia. College President From 1880 to 1884, Hurth was the President of St. Joseph‚Äôs Commercial College (now the College of Mount Saint Joseph) in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The Bishop of Dacca On 26 June 1894 he was appointed by Pope Leo XIII as the Bishop of Dacca in British India (now Dhaka, Bangladesh). He was the third of his Order to have had this position. He was consecrated to it on 16 September 1894 at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame by the Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee, Joseph Rademacher, with the assistance from two other bishops, Henry Joseph Richter of Grand Rapids, Michigan and James Schwebach of La Crosse, Wisconsin. He left at midnight for a trip that would take him to New York City, to Rome for an audience with the Pope and eventually to Dacca.(en) \\"A Bishop for India\\", Irish World, New York City, New York, USA, Saturday, 22 September 1894, p. 4, col. 7 The next 14 years in Dacca were quiet and uneventful for Bishop Hurth. In 1908, he wrote an article in English about his diocese for an American publication, The Catholic Encyclopedia.(en) P. J. Hurth, \\"Dacca\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume IV, (New York: Robert Appleton Co., 1908), pp. vii, 601-602 But he was beginning to have problems with his health so, on 15 February 1909, he resigned. On the same day, he was appointed as the Titular Bishop of Milopotamus. His new title might be in Ancient Greece but he was in good company. The previous holder was an Englishman, Nicholas Wiseman, before he became a Cardinal and the first Archbishop of Westminster. But Hurth did not forget India. In 1911, when he returned to Cincinnati, he was interviewed by a local newspaper. When he was asked about India, he said that, since the conditions were changing slowly in India, \\"it was only a question of time when caste would no longer exist and child marriage would be abolished.\\" He was in the city for the 5th National Eucharistic Congress of the Catholic Church of America.(en) \\"Catholic Bishop Sees India Change\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, Monday, 2 October 1911, p. 11, col. 2 The Bishop of Nueva Segovia On 7 January 1913, Pope Pius X sent Hurth to the Philippines to be the Bishop of Nueva Segovia in Luzon, the largest of the islands. In Vigan City, the see of the diocese, Hurth served for another 13 years. But, unlike Dacca, his second tour was not quiet and uneventful. One reporter remarked that the Bishop had \\"the rather melancholy privilege of ruling the most afflicted diocese under the United States jurisdiction\\".(en) University College Items, \\"At the Holy Cross College\\", The Catholic University Bulletin, November 1916, Vol. XXII, No. 8, New Series, pp. 166-167 His see had been devastated by revolutions, typhoons, earthquakes, cyclones and deserted by the missionary funds from Europe. The conditions were so bad ‚Äì \\"verily in ruins\\" ‚Äì that at least nineteen congregations did not have any buildings to hold their Masses and house their priests. So Bishop Hurth had to send out appeals everywhere for help. That was one of the reasons for his trip to the United States in late 1916 and early 1917.(en) \\"Worthy Appeal\\", Kentucky Irish American, Louisville, Kentucky, USA, Saturday, 28 October 1916, p. 2, col. 2 Retirement On 12 November 1926, Hurth resigned. On the same day, he became Honorary Bishop of Bosra. Two weeks later, he was on his way back to America aboard an ocean liner. After many years in India and the Philippines, he was used to the tropical weather. But, one Saturday, just days from New York City, he went outside for a walk around the deck and a blast of cold air gave him a \\"heart shock\\". He had to be taken to the hospital in New York City straight from the piers. But he quickly recovered.(en) \\"Philippine Bishop Ill\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, Tuesday, 30 November 1926, p. 10, col. 6 Bishop Hurth even felt healthy enough in 1927 to travel to Helena, Montana, and San Antonio, Texas. In Helena, he was the principal consecrator at the ordination of George Joseph Finnigan, C.S.C., as the Bishop of that city. But in San Antonio he was one of the observers at the consecration of Bishop Arthur Jerome Drossaerts as the first Archbishop of San Antonio.(en) \\"Pageant of Catholics at Installation\\", The Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, USA, Thursday, 17 February 1927, Sec. 2, p. 15, col. 1-2 In spite of all his travels to faraway lands, Hurth never forgot his hometown.

The three nitrogen centres can bind metals in a tridentate fashion, forming pincer complexes. Diiminopyridines are notable as non-innocent ligand that can assume more than one oxidation state. Complexes of DIPs participate in a range of chemical reactions, including ethylene polymerization, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation. Synthesis and properties of DIP ligands Many 2,6-diiminopyridines have been prepared. The dianilido ligands can be synthesized by Schiff base condensation of commercially available 2,6-diacetylpyridine with two equivalents of substituted anilines. Using substituted anilines, complexes one can obtain DIPs with diverse steric environments. Commonly used anilines are 2,4,6-trimethylaniline and 2,6-diisopropylaniline. Unsymmetric variations have been established by successive condensation of different anilines. The dicarbonyl portion of the backbone can be further modified, as with 2,6-dipyridecarboxaldehyde and 2,6-dibenzoylpyridine. Most commonly, variations in the DIP arise from changes in the anilines. :diiminopyridine_synthesis =Effect of steric bulk= Depending on its steric bulk, DIP ligands form complexes of 2:1 and 1:1 ratios, M(DIP)Lx and M(DIP)2, respectively. The 2:1 complexes occur for unhindered DIP ligands. Although such complexes are coordinatively saturated, they have been studied for their electronic and structural properties. Formation of 2:1 complexation is suppressed with bulky DIP ligands. Complexes of the type M(DIP)Ln exhibit diverse reactivity. Fe and Co complexes The reduction of the Fe(II)bis(imino)pyridineX2 with sodium amalgam under nitrogen yields a square- pyramidal) bis(nitrogen) complex. This complex is a useful precursor to other derivatives by exchange of the dinitrogen ligands with H2 and CO, to give the monohydrogen or dicarbonyl complexes. Arylazides give imido complexes. Fe(DIP)(N2)2 is a precursor to highly active catalysts for hydrosilylation and hydrogenation reactions. Dissociation of N2 from Fe(DIP)(N2)2 results in binding of the anilino arene in an Œ∑6-fashion. This binding mode may play a role in the catalytic hydrogenation cycle. : Structure of Co(DIP)Cl where DIP = C5H3N-2,6-(C(NAr)Me)2 (Ar = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) derived from diacetylpyridine and 2,6-diisopropylaniline). The reactivity of cobalt- and iron-DIP complexes are similar. Cobalt DIP complexes with azide ligands have been shown to lose N2 to give reactive nitrido complexes that undergo C-H activation of benzylic sites of the aryl substituents . The resulting cyclometalated amide adopt a roughly planar geometry. Non-innocence of DIP complexes The highly conjugated ligand framework of bis(imino)pyridine stabilizes metals in unusual oxidation states. The ability of the neutral complex to accept up to three electrons leads to ambiguity about the oxidation states of the metal center. The complex Fe(DIP)(N2)2 complex is ostensibly a 18e complex, consisting of Fe(0) with five 2-electron ligands. M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy indicates, however, that this complex is better described as a ferrous derivative of DIP2‚àí. This assignment is corroborated by the high frequency of the ŒΩNN vibration in the infrared spectrum, which is more consistent with Fe(II). Thus, reduction of Fe(DIP)Br2 is ligand-centered, not Fe-centered. This non-innocent behavior allows iron-DIP complexes to participate in 2e redox reactions, which is a pattern more usually seen for complexes of platinum group metals. Catalytic reactions of M-DIP complexes The catalytic properties of DIP complexes of Fe, Co, and Ni have attracted much attention. In principle, catalyst derived from \\"base metals\\" are preferred to noble transition metal catalysis due to low environmental impact and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, owing to its modular synthesis, the DIP ligand is easily modifiable allowing diversity in ligand screening. Complexes of the type M(DIP)Xn serve as precatalysts for ethylene polymerization. The precatalysts are activated by treatment with methylaluminoxane (MAO), which serves as a co-catalyst. Activities for 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine iron complexes are often comparable to or greater than group 4 metallocenes. The aryl substituents greatly affect the products. Small aryl substituents allow for highly selective production of oligomeric Œ±-olefins, whereas bulky groups provide strictly linear, high molecular weight polyethylene. Silica-supported and homogeneous catalysts have been reported. Traditionally catalyzed by Pt and other precious metals, hydrosilylation is also catalyzed by Fe-DIP complexes. Reactions proceed under mild conditions and give exclusively anti- Markovnikov product. The catalysts exhibit some tolerance for functional group. Depending on the steric properties of the ligand, Fe-DIP complexes catalyze hydrogenation of terminal olefins.  Variations of DIP ligands In N-heterocyclic carbene variations of the diiminopyridine complex, the pyridine or imine substituents is replaced with an NHC group. The aryl substituted bis(imino)NHC complexes produce tridentate ligands, while the pyridine exchanged NHC forms exclusively bidentate complexes. This is presumably due to the additional strain from the 5 member ring of the central carbene. : References Category:Coordination compounds Category:Tridentate ligands Category:Pyridines Category:Imines ","title":"Diiminopyridine"},{"id":"38351612","text":"Nick Matuhin (born as Nikita Matuhin on 5 April 1990 in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union) is an amateur German freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's super heavyweight category.

While Leo was also criticized by ecclesiastical officials after his death,http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vatican/esp_vatican30c.htm. \\"The Criminal History of the Papacy-3\\". Nexus Magazine, 2007. the Gospel was a product of the Goliard movement.  Text of the Gospel  At that time, the Pope said to the Romans, \\"When the son of man comes to the seat of our majesty, first say, \`Friend, why have you come?' But if he continues knocking without giving you anything, throw him out into the outer darkness.\\" And it came to pass that a certain poor cleric came to the Curia of the Lord Pope and cried out, saying, \\"Do you, at least, have mercy on me, you doorkeepers of the Pope, for the hand of poverty has touched me. I am indeed needy and poor. Therefore, I beg you to come to my aid.\\" But when they heard him they were exceeding angry, and they said, \\"Friend, you and your poverty can go to hell. Get thou behind me, Satan, because you do not smell of money. Amen, amen, I say to you, you shall not enter into the joy of your lord [the Pope] until you pay your last farthing.\\" So the poor man went away and sold his coat and his shirt and everything he owned and gave it to the cardinals and doorkeepers and chamberlains. But they said, \\"What is this among so many?\\" They threw him out, and he went off weeping bitterly and inconsolably. Later on, a certain rich cleric came to the Curia. He was gross and fat and swollen, and had committed treacherous murder. He bribed first the doorkeeper, then the chamberlain, then the cardinals. But they put their heads together and demanded more. However, the Lord Pope heard that his cardinals and ministers had been lavishly bribed by the cleric, and he was sick even to death. So the rich man sent him medicine in the form of gold and silver, and straightway he was healed. The Lord pope summoned his cardinals and ministers and said to them, \\"Brethren, be vigilant lest anyone deceive you with empty words. My example I give unto you, that you might grab just as I grab.\\"Anonymous. Carmina Burana, cited in http://usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh315/mark%20of%20silver.htm.  Historical Significance of the Gospel  As a single entity, the Gospel was not influential or important. It was, after all, only one of many competing satires of papal luxury. However, the work is indicative of the Goliard movement as a whole, and is often used as an example of the sociopolitical situation in the later half of the twelfth century. Although it is fairly short, the Gospel's scathing commentary was typical of the time, and its sentiments (against abuses of monetary power, such as papal decadence or simony) are reflected in many other poems of the Middle Ages, including The Apocalypse of Bishop Golias and The Simonie (also known as Poem on the Evil Times of Edward II)Medieval English Political Writings.

It is owned by Intermountain Healthcare. The hospital serves Cache Valley, including Cache County, Utah and Franklin County, Idaho, and western Wyoming. Logan Regional's mission is \\"Helping People Live the Healthiest Lives Possible.\\" The hospital services include a Level III Trauma Center, Cancer Center, Women and Newborn Center, digital imaging services, and heart catheterization services. Logan Regional was named one of the United States' 100 top hospitals in 2018, marking the sixth consecutive year it has received this honor. History The predecessor to Logan Regional Hospital, and Cache Valley's first hospital, was the William Budge Memorial Hospital. Built in 1914, it was a 50-bed facility that offered operating rooms and maternity care. In 1948, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acquired Cache Valley's two hospitals, The Budge Memorial Hospital and Cache Valley General Hospital, as part of the church's health system. In 1975, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints turned over its system of 15 hospitals, including Logan LDS Hospital, to the communities they served. A secular, not-for-profit health care system, Intermountain Healthcare was formed to operate the hospital system. Logan LDS Hospital was renamed Logan Hospital. The hospital relocated in 1980 to a larger, more modern facility where they continue to operate. Since relocating, Logan Regional has added the Intermountain Budge Clinic (opened in 2000) to the hospital campus, a Women and Newborn Center (opened in 2007), and a Cancer Center (opened in 2008). In 2015, Logan Regional Hospital and the Budge Clinic expanded its facility by 154,000 square feet. Services Logan Regional provides cancer services, a level III trauma center, heart services, inpatient care units, outpatient services, rehabilitation and therapy, a sleep center, sports medicine, orthopedics, surgical services, a Women and Newborn Center, Wound and Hyperbaric Center, a Nutrition and Weight Center, and a Community Education Center. =Cancer services= Logan Regional provides cancer services including brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation oncology services. In addition to cancer screenings and support services, the cancer center is accredited as an Intermountain Cancer Center, and is recognized for providing patients with access to a full scope of services required to diagnose, treat, rehabilitate, and support patients with cancer. =Cardiac services= In 2012, Logan Regional added two new heart catheterization labs which provide diagnostic and an interventional heart program, specialized radiology services and pain management procedures. These services were provided for in part by more than $400,000 in donations. =Orthopedics and sports medicine= Logan Regional's Certified Sports Medicine Physicians provide a full range of sports medicine and orthopedic care for athletes, including a concussion clinic. Logan Regional Orthopedics and Sports Medicine is the official medical provider for: *Utah State University *Sky View High School *Mountain Crest High School *Ridgeline High School *Green Canyon High School =Women & newborn center= Logan Regional provides services for pregnancy, labor & delivery, breastfeeding support, a neonatal care unit, and a mammography and imaging center.

Commonwealth Hill is located about north north west of Tarcoola and south west of Coober Pedy in the state of South Australia. The property occupies an area of approximately or one million hectares, making it the second largest sheep station in Australia, after Rawlinna Station. It is currently owned by the Jumbuck Pastoral Company. The land on which the station is situated is described as a flat sandy plain on the north western margin of the Gawler Craton covered with sand sheets and dunefields. Low mulga woodlands and tall myall shrublands over perennial grasses dominate with occasional salt lakes and lunette systems. In 1947 the station was enjoying an excellent season after good rains produced an abundance of fresh green feed for stock during the summer. Unfortunately the area was also rife with rumours that the Woomera Test Range was to be expanded and that stations including Commonwealth Hill, Bulgunnia, Roxby Downs and Andamooka would lose some of land which in turn would reduce their wool clip. The rumours were true and the station lies within the Woomera Test Range Area. Byron MacLachlan, the leaseholder of Commonwealth Hill in 1947, along with a consortium of pastoralists and lawyers established a working agreement to ensure the continuation of pastoral activity that would not interfere with the long range weapons project. In 1956 before the trials of the Black Knight Rocket commenced at Woomera safety risks to pastoralists were identified as a key concern. In 1957 the minister of Supply, Howard Beale spoke with the graziers who could be affected by the trials and announced that the Commonwealth government would pay for the installation of blast-proof shelters. An iron ore exploration company, Apollo Minerals, was given permission in 2011 by the Defence Department to start work on its prospect in the area following a Federal Government review on mining in the former missile testing area.

Player versus player gameplay is allowed, but discouraged among the community and development team. The game focuses on surviving against the zombies and the elements. The zombies consisted of a normal walking zombie, a fat postal worker zombie nicknamed \\"Bob\\", and a zombie dog. Future builds would have presented new character models for both players, zombies, and non-player characters (NPCs). Some of these NPCs include soldiers called \\"Sirens of the Apocalypse\\" that were sent in as riot control when the infection first started, sniper teams that are a special branch of this group, crazed survivors, sane survivors, various wildlife such as deer, rabbits, boars, alligators, birds, etc. The Dead Linger was set in a short time after the zombie apocalypse begins. The player was tasked with the simple necessities of searching for supplies, such as food and water in a procedurally-generated world of 360 square kilometers, containing permanently placed roads, trees, and landscapes with randomly placed houses and items. Every building throughout the world was enterable and explorable to the player, ranging from suburbs, towns, cities and prisons. The Dead Linger features many gameplay mechanics. Some of the more notable mechanics included free-form barricading, a fully explorable world not limited by invisible walls, loading screens, or impassible obstacles, and modular housing and zombies. There were to be First-person shooter and survival horror elements, including melee and ranged weapon mechanics like hitting and shooting, running, jumping, (soon) swimming, hunting and skinning animals, etc. By its full release, the game would have supported multiple vehicles ranging from small boats to motorcycles to airplanes, free-form welding, various unique types of non-special infected, mine shafts, interstate systems, a \\"treasured items\\" system, a full crafting and cooking system, complete character customization, and more. Some of the more desirable features that would have been included by release include: a sanity and hallucination system, a free- form driving system (one must open the door manually, enter, start the car, repair the car, etc.) and a full seasonal system including weather. Development The Dead Linger was announced in late 2011. The official alpha Build 1 was released on October 31, 2012. The game was set to be more of a realistic setting of the zombie apocalypse than other titles at the time. The game was originally being developed using the Ogre3D Engine, but was replaced with the Unity Engine for Build 10, released in September 2013, and later underwent a second engine change to Unreal Engine 4. As of the switch to Unreal Engine 4, the in-game play area was no longer be procedurally- generated, but rather be set in a static environment with future plans for randomized regions and events. Between July and November, the Unreal Engine 4 build was developed and released. The first build released was not accessible by regular game keys, but this was quickly fixed once the issue was uncovered. On November 12, 2015, Geoff and Richard Keene jointly posted \\"The Final Word\\", citing an inability to continue financing the game's development. Development of The Dead Linger was halted at this time. Unable to continue financing the project, Sandswept ended all development of The Dead Linger on November 12, 2015. Sandswept labeled the game 'indefinitely postponed' with future development unlikely, and the game was removed from sale on Steam shortly thereafter.

The victim was fifty-one-year-old Jukka S. Lahti, a social psychologist and father of four. Initially, the police was looking for an outside perpetrator, but in September 2009, the victim's widow Anneli Auer was arrested and charged with the murder. She was twice convicted in the district court, but both times the appeals court reversed the verdict, and finally in December 2015, the acquittal became permanent, when the Supreme Court of Finland denied the prosecution's appeal.  Murder night and initial investigation  The victim's wife, Anneli Auer (born 1965), called the emergency number at 2:43 AM on December 1, 2006. According to Auer, a masked assailant had attacked her husband in the family home. Lahti had been stabbed multiple times and hit in the head with a blunt object, and Auer was also wounded. The police detained or arrested several people, among them an actor whom Auer had identified as the assailant but who was later cleared. One theory by the police was that the murder had been a revenge, because Lahti had been working as an HR director in a company that had laid off many people. In the spring of 2008 the police conducted hundreds of DNA tests among the company's employees.  Auer arrested  In August 2008, the case received a new chief investigator, and the police started to focus on the phone call that Auer had made to the emergency services. According to the police, the tape had no evidence of an outside killer. The tape had also been analyzed by the FBI. An undercover officer befriended Auer and they dated for 7‚Äì8 months. The police also bugged Auer's phone and even her home for three days. According to a police representative, the undercover operation yielded neither inculpatory nor exculpatory evidence. In May 2011, the Supreme Court of Finland ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to hand over information about the operation to Auer, except for the names of officers and some other details. On 28 September 2009, Anneli Auer was arrested. The theory was that she had killed Lahti during the phone call and staged the crime scene. Auer was tried before a three-judge panel in the Satakunta District Court. In November 2010, she was found guilty. One of the judges had voted to acquit her.Helsingin Sanomat - International Edition: report of the verdict of the District Court of Satakunta Auer appealed the verdict to the Vaasa Court of Appeal, which in July 2011 acquitted her of all charges. The verdict was unanimous.  Second set of trials  In October 2012, the Supreme Court of Finland decided to send the case back to Satakunta District Court, because of the new evidence the prosecutors presented after Auer's appeal. In the summer of 2013 it was reported that the DNA sample that was taken from the crime scene had in fact been contaminated and the unknown male DNA belonged to a crime laboratory examiner. In December 2013, the Satakunta District Court again convicted Auer in a 2‚Äì1 ruling, and sentenced her to life imprisonment. Auer appealed against her second conviction to Vaasa Court of Appeal. The appeal hearings began in September 2014 and ended in October. In February 2015, the Vaasa Court of Appeal overturned her conviction for the second time. The verdict was 2‚Äì1, with one of the judges ruling to uphold the District Court's verdict. According to the verdict, it had not been proven that Auer had staged the crime scene, and the presence of an outside perpetrator could not be ruled out based on the evidence. The court did not accept the prosecution's claim that the phone call to the emergency services contained parts that Auer had pre- recorded. The judge who voted to convict Auer was of the opinion that she was the killer and had staged the crime scene. The prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court and provided the court with new evidence. An analysis done on behalf of the prosecution claimed to prove that the phone call had been pre- recorded by Auer. By pre-recording the sounds of the killing before the phone call, Auer would have had more time to stage the crime scene. The analysis also concluded that Auer had yelled \\"Die\\" (kuole) instead of \\"Don't die\\" (√§l√§ kuole), as she claimed. The defense team rebutted the claim with their own expert statement, which stated that the tape had no evidence of tampering, and that an outside person can be heard on it. In December 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the Court of Appeal verdict which had found Auer not guilty of the murder of her husband. Auer had spent more than 600 days in prison for the murder, and in 2016 she was awarded a compensation of about 500,000 euros. At 800 euros per day it was the highest compensation given to a falsely imprisoned person in Finland. In 2016 over 50 police officers were charged for trying to access Auer's information in the police database. Most of them received a fine.

It was built in 1895 at in the 1st District of Budapest. The first church for the Lutherans of Buda was built by Maria Dorothea, third wife of Palatine Joseph, in 1846, at :hu:D√≠sz t√©r. The site was taken over by the Ministry of Defence, so a new church was built near Vienna Gate. Background The building was designed by M√≥r Kallina and it was consecrated in 1895 by S√°muel S√°rk√°ny, bishop of the Lutheran diocese of B√°nya. It has eclectic neobaroque style with a neobaroque fa√ßade. Its entrance is surrounded by two Corinthian order-like columns with shoulders. It has a tall, slim square tower whose steeple is again neobaroque in style. There is a double loft over the entrance. Most of the church was destroyed by a bomb detonation during the Siege of Budapest in 1945. Only the outer walls escaped destruction. The altar, the benches and the organ were all lost. Plans for reconstruction were made by L√≥r√°nt Friedrich and Jr Gyula Bretz. The new church was sanctified by Lajos Ordas bishop on Palm Sunday, 1948. While the exterior retained its neobaroque flavour in a simplified form, the interior became much austere. There is a huge cross behind the wooden altar table and a mosaic window over it admitting some light within. There is a red marble chrzcielnica at the altar and a bronze tablet about vicar G√°bor Sztehlo. This church today is the centre of liturgical life for the Lutheran Diocese of Budav√°r. There are several services every Sunday and on holidays. Flats and offices for the vicars, rooms for the congregation and the centre for the German-speaking Lutheran Diocese of Budav√°r adjoin the church. Since 1952, it has also been the centre of the Northern Lutheran See. Several bishops were ordained here. The tower and the paved area in front of the church were renovated in 2008. Pulpit The church has no pulpit because the original one was destroyed in 1945 together with all the other pieces of furniture. This pulpit was a precious relic from the first church on D√≠sz t√©r because its upper part was transferred here from the demolished building. The plans of M√≥r Kallina, dated 1894, show a monumental altar-pulpit in line with the Central-European Lutheran tradition. These interior plans were only partially executed and the pulpit was built instead as a separate structure on the left side of the apse. The access was from the sacristy through a steep stairway. The hexagonal wooden balcony was supported by a huge hexagonal pillar. The surface imitated marble veneer with gilt decorations. The relief on the middle panel depicted The Sower as a Hungarian peasant among trees and fields. The other four panels were decorated with Christian symbols including the scriptures, cross, torches, and a laurel wreath. On the underside of the abat-voix there was the Eye of Providence between rays of light. The hexagonal canopy was crowned with the Tablets of Stone set on silvery clouds and framed with gilt palm and laurel branches.Gy≈ëry Aranka: Evang√©likus templomm≈±v√©szet Budapesten, Budapesti evang√©likus egyh√°zak, 1935, pp. 39-40.

It's an exception in the talmudical hermeneutics, since it doesn't base the law on the cited verse, but uses the verse as a hint. Sometimes it isn't clear whether the verse has been quoted as an asmachta or as a source, which can lead to controversy over the de'oraita or derabanan quality of the law. An example of such a case is the controversy over berakhah she'eina tzricha or berakhah levatala, the prohibition to say a prayer outside its context. The Talmud says \\"Anyone who recites an unnecessary blessing violates the biblical prohibition: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\\".Berachot 33a While Maimonides sees it as a source,Mishneh Torah, Berachot 1, 15: \\"Whoever recites a blessing unnecessarily takes the name of God in vain and is like one who swears in vain.\\" the Tosafists see it as an asmachta.The Aramaic source text: \\"◊ï◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ì◊û◊ë◊®◊ö ◊ë◊®◊õ◊î ◊©◊ê◊ô◊†◊î ◊¶◊®◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ï◊ß◊¢◊ë◊® ◊û◊©◊ï◊ù ◊ë◊ú ◊™◊©◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊õ◊ê ◊ì◊î◊î◊ô◊ê ◊ì◊®◊©◊î ◊ì◊®◊ë◊†◊ü\\" (Tosafot on Rosh Hashanah 33a) Examples * Netilat Yadaim - part of ritual washing in Judaism, in which only the hands are washed as a purification ritual. Rabbinic Halakha requires this ritual to be done before eating bread. The Talmud attributes this law to asmachta‚Äî regarding a zav, the Torah says: \\"And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water...\\".Leviticus 15, 13 King James Translation. The Talmud takes this as an allusion for a general rinsing of the hands.Chullin 106a: \\"From here the Sages based washing of the hands upon a verse from the Torah.\\" * Measures - the specific amounts and sizes of Halakhic objects. For example, the minimum width of Tefillin straps is known through a law given to Moses at Sinai to be the size of a grain of barley. This and other halakhic measures have their source in asmachta; the Talmud uses the verse of the Seven Species as an allusion for all measures that are based on the sizes of various fruits.The Hebrew source text: \\"◊ê◊®◊• ◊ó◊ò◊î ◊ï◊©◊¢◊ï◊®◊î ◊ï◊í◊§◊ü ◊ï◊™◊ê◊†◊î ◊ï◊®◊û◊ï◊ü ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ñ◊ô◊™ ◊©◊û◊ü ◊ï◊ì◊ë◊© ◊ï◊ê◊û◊® ◊®◊ë ◊ó◊†◊ô◊ü ◊õ◊ú ◊î◊§◊°◊ï◊ß ◊î◊ñ◊î ◊ú◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ü ◊†◊ê◊û◊® ◊ó◊ò◊î ◊ú◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊û◊†◊ï◊í◊¢ ◊ì◊™◊†◊ü ◊î◊†◊õ◊†◊° ◊ú◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊î◊û◊†◊ï◊í◊¢ ◊ï◊õ◊ú◊ô◊ï ◊¢◊ú ◊õ◊™◊§◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊°◊†◊ì◊ú◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊ò◊ë◊¢◊ï◊™◊ô◊ï ◊ë◊ô◊ì◊ï ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ï◊î◊ü ◊ò◊û◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ô◊ì ◊î◊ô◊î ◊ú◊ë◊ï◊© ◊õ◊ú◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊°◊†◊ì◊ú◊ô◊ï ◊ë◊®◊í◊ú◊ô◊ï ◊ï◊ò◊ë◊¢◊ï◊™◊ô◊ï ◊ë◊ê◊¶◊ë◊¢◊ï◊™◊ô◊ï ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ò◊û◊ê ◊û◊ô◊ì ◊ï◊î◊ü ◊ò◊î◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ì ◊©◊ô◊©◊î◊î ◊ë◊õ◊ì◊ô ◊ê◊õ◊ô◊ú◊™ ◊§◊®◊° ◊§◊™ ◊ó◊ò◊ô◊ü ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊§◊™ ◊©◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ô◊°◊ë ◊ï◊ê◊ï◊õ◊ú ◊ë◊ú◊ô◊§◊™◊ü ◊©◊¢◊ï◊®◊î ◊ì◊™◊†◊ü ◊¢◊¶◊ù ◊õ◊©◊¢◊ï◊®◊î ◊û◊ò◊û◊ê ◊ë◊û◊í◊¢ ◊ï◊ë◊û◊©◊ê ◊ï◊ê◊ô◊†◊ï ◊û◊ò◊û◊ê ◊ë◊ê◊î◊ú ◊í◊§◊ü ◊õ◊ì◊ô ◊®◊ë◊ô◊¢◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊†◊ñ◊ô◊® ◊™◊ê◊†◊î ◊õ◊í◊®◊ï◊í◊®◊™ ◊ú◊î◊ï◊¶◊ê◊™ ◊©◊ë◊™ ◊®◊û◊ï◊ü ◊ì◊™◊†◊ü ◊õ◊ú ◊õ◊ú◊ô ◊ë◊¢◊ú◊ô ◊ë◊™◊ô◊ù ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ü ◊õ◊®◊û◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù (◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ó, ◊ó) ◊ê◊®◊• ◊ñ◊ô◊™ ◊©◊û◊ü (◊ï◊ì◊ë◊©) ◊ê◊®◊• ◊©◊õ◊ú ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊î ◊õ◊ñ◊ô◊™◊ô◊ù ◊õ◊ú ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊î ◊°◊ú◊ß◊ê ◊ì◊¢◊™◊ö ◊î◊ê ◊ê◊ô◊õ◊ê ◊î◊†◊ô ◊ì◊ê◊û◊®◊ô◊†◊ü ◊ê◊ú◊ê ◊ê◊ô◊û◊ê ◊©◊®◊ï◊ë ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊î ◊õ◊ñ◊ô◊™◊ô◊ù ◊ì◊ë◊© ◊õ◊õ◊ï◊™◊ë◊™ ◊î◊í◊°◊î ◊ë◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊î◊õ◊§◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ú◊û◊ê ◊ì◊ê◊ï◊®◊ô◊ô◊™◊ê ◊†◊ô◊†◊î◊ï ◊ï◊™◊°◊ë◊®◊ê ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ô ◊õ◊™◊ô◊ë◊ô ◊ê◊ú◊ê ◊î◊ú◊õ◊™◊ê ◊†◊ô◊†◊î◊ï ◊ï◊ß◊®◊ê ◊ê◊°◊û◊õ◊™◊ê ◊ë◊¢◊ú◊û◊ê\\"(Succa 5).

The people, however, accepted these seven laws as tradition, connecting them with the verse as aid to memory.\\" Yom Tov Asevilli (the Ritva) objects to Maimonides' explanation, and claims that God himself devised the various asmachta sources and embedded them in the Torah as allusions to be used by the sages.Ritva commentary to tractate Rosh Hashana, page 16a, in the paragraph starting with the word 'Tanya'; Hebrew source text: \\"◊©◊õ◊ú ◊û◊î ◊©◊ô◊© ◊ú◊ï ◊ê◊°◊û◊õ◊™◊ê ◊û◊ü ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊î◊¢◊ô◊ì ◊î◊ß◊ì◊ï◊© ◊ë◊®◊ï◊ö ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊©◊®◊ê◊ï◊ô ◊ú◊¢◊©◊ï◊™ ◊õ◊ü ◊ê◊ú◊ê ◊©◊ú◊ê ◊ß◊ë◊¢◊ï ◊ó◊ï◊ë◊î ◊ï◊û◊°◊®◊ï ◊ú◊ó◊õ◊û◊ô◊ù, ◊ï◊ñ◊î ◊ì◊ë◊® ◊ë◊®◊ï◊® ◊ï◊ê◊û◊™ ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊õ◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô ◊î◊û◊§◊®◊©◊ô◊ù ◊î◊ê◊°◊û◊õ◊™◊ï◊™ ◊©◊î◊ï◊ê ◊õ◊ì◊®◊ö ◊°◊ô◊û◊ü ◊©◊†◊™◊†◊ï ◊ó◊õ◊û◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊©◊õ◊ï◊ï◊†◊î ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊ú◊õ◊ö, ◊ó◊° ◊ï◊ó◊ú◊ô◊ú◊î, ◊ô◊©◊™◊ß◊¢ ◊î◊ì◊ë◊® ◊ï◊ú◊ê ◊ô◊ê◊û◊®, ◊©◊ñ◊ï ◊ì◊¢◊™ ◊û◊ô◊†◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ï◊ê, ◊ê◊ë◊ú ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊î◊¢◊ô◊ì◊î ◊ë◊õ◊ö ◊ï◊û◊°◊®◊î ◊ó◊ô◊ï◊ë ◊î◊ì◊ë◊® ◊ú◊ß◊ë◊¢◊ï ◊ó◊õ◊û◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ù ◊ô◊®◊¶◊ï, ◊õ◊û◊ï ◊©◊õ◊™◊ï◊ë ◊ï◊¢◊©◊ô◊™ ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ì◊ë◊® ◊¢◊ú ◊§◊ô ◊î◊ì◊ë◊® ◊ê◊©◊® ◊ô◊í◊ô◊ì◊ï ◊ú◊ö ◊ï◊ú◊§◊ô◊õ◊ö ◊™◊û◊¶◊ê ◊î◊ó◊õ◊û◊ô◊ù ◊†◊ï◊™◊†◊ô◊ü ◊ë◊õ◊ú ◊û◊ß◊ï◊ù ◊®◊ê◊ô◊î ◊ê◊ï ◊ñ◊õ◊® ◊ê◊ï ◊ê◊°◊û◊õ◊™◊ê ◊ú◊ì◊ë◊®◊ô◊î◊ù ◊û◊ü ◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î, ◊õ◊ú◊ï◊û◊® ◊©◊ê◊ô◊†◊ù ◊û◊ó◊ì◊©◊ô◊ù ◊ì◊ë◊® ◊û◊ú◊ë◊ù, ◊ï◊õ◊ú ◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊©◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊§◊î ◊®◊û◊ï◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊©◊î◊ô◊ê ◊™◊û◊ô◊û◊î ◊ï◊ó◊° ◊ï◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊©◊î◊ô◊ê ◊ó◊°◊ô◊®◊î ◊õ◊ú◊ï◊ù\\".

Creativity In his work he used artistic manifestations. His works and projects are often political and ethical statements, preaching the demand of the \\"creative act\\" on the subject. Jerzy Bere≈õ developed his own unique style, but his practices were related: happening and these performance, although I never admit to any relationship with these trends in the arts demonstrations, calling their actions (actions, \\" Masses \\"). Beres' Art is an art symbol, a metaphor, and a metaphysics. His art is the result of a dispute with known artist of the twentieth century such as the dramatists Witkacy, Kantor and conceptual artist, Duchamp. Artistic activity  In 1956, he completed a program in sculpture in the Academy of Fine Arts in Xawery Dunikowski. His first solo exhibition was in 1958 in the Krak√≥w House of Artists, where he presented the sculptures: 'Lullaby', 'The Sun', 'Mother', 'Eve', 'anxiety', 'Idyll' made of plaster and reinforced concrete. His experience at this exhibition influenced his decision to halt the work he had been doing up to this point and along with it the traditional methods he learned from the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. Just before 1960, he created his first sculptures of wood:'Rzepicha' and 'Bart'. However, these were very realistic renderings that led the artist to turn to minimalism. Since then, his sculptures in wood have become increasingly simple and stay as close as possible to the nature of the material used. In 1960 he created work out of natural materials in the series hallucinations and ine 1967 in the series The Oracle. He used field stones, hemp rope, scraps of canvas bag, leather straps (the characteristic of materials for his work). In 1968, Beres presented in Foksal Gallery in Warsaw first artistic manifestation of prophecy 'I'. It opens up a whole series of speeches that are a commentary on politics, religion, art and philosophy, in which the artist often uses his own body and the object. His work called \\"Masses\\" discusses the most important Polish problems; the Mass Romantic,the \\" political Mass, and the Mass in Polish.\\" Selected performances *1968 - Prophecy, Gallery Foksal, London *1968 - The Prophecy II, Gallery Krzysztofory, Krak√≥w *1968 - Bread, painted black, Gallery Krzysztofory, Krak√≥w *1972 - bread colorfully painted, Office Andrzej Partum Poetry, Warsaw *1972 - Transfiguration and Art Center, S√∂dert√§lje *1973 - Transfiguration II, Gallery Desa, Krak√≥w *1973 - Transfiguration III Fri Altar author, BWA, Lublin *1973 - Untitled, Contemporary Gallery, Warsaw *1973 - Bid, Gallery Pi, Krak√≥w *1974 - wooden pathway, Gruga Park, Essen *1974 - a beautiful altar, the altar clean, BWA, Wroc≈Çaw *1974 - Face The Altar, Studio Gallery, London *1975 - reflective Mass, the Metal Works.

He is contracted to South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers for domestic matches. He is a left-handed middle-order batsman and a part-time bowler. Head had an early start to his career, making his first-class at the age of 18 and representing Australia in the 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He kept his place in South Australia's Sheffield Shield side consistently and became the team's captain in 2015.

Retrieved 28 January 2013. After making his name playing grade cricket for Tea Tree Gully Cricket Club, Head made his first-class cricket debut for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield at the age of 18 in early 2012. He made a promising start to his career with three matches for South Australia, scoring his maiden half- century in his second match and falling short of scoring his maiden century in his third match with 90 runs against Tasmania. He was rewarded at the end of the season with a rookie contract with South Australia. He went on to play 18 under-19 One Day International (ODI) matches for the Australian national team, including at the 2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.Under-19 ODI matches played by Travis Head (18) ‚Äì CricketArchive. Retrieved 28 January 2013. He impressed with both bat and ball during the tournament, scoring 87 off 42 balls against Scotland and taking three wickets against Bangladesh in the quarter-final. He showed leadership qualities when he captained South Australia to victory in the 2012‚Äì13 National Under-19 Championships, being named Player of the Championship for the second consecutive year. Head remained a regular selection for the 2012‚Äì13 season, usually batting in the middle order.Sheffield Shield 2012/13: batting and fielding for South Australia ‚Äì CricketArchive. Retrieved 28 January 2013. He came close to scoring his maiden century with 95 against Western Australia. Though he was not dismissed, he ran out of batting partners and was stranded at the crease five runs short of the milestone. He subsequently played a single Twenty20 game for the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League, replacing the injured Kieron Pollard in the team. Shortly after South Australia's Shield win against Victoria in January 2013, he was hit by a car outside a hotel in Adelaide, receiving injuries to his head and back, but he made a full recovery and was able to return for South Australia's next match. Head was one of six young Australian players to be part of the inaugural Ageas Bowl International Cricket Academy during the 2013 season, training at the ground's facilities. In the early part of Head's career he struggled to reach his maiden first-class century, instead finishing with scores in the nineties on multiple occasions. After his score of 90 in his debut season and his unbeaten 95 against Western Australia in 2012, he made it to the nineties three times in the 2013‚Äì14 Sheffield Shield season, against Western Australia twice more and once against Tasmania with scores of 92, 98 and 98 respectively. Despite this he was able to score a List A century for the National Performance Squad against South Africa A in July 2014. South Australian captaincy and international career (2015‚Äìpresent) =Playing for Australia (2015‚Äì2016)= In February 2015 Head was named to replace Johan Botha as the captain of South Australia, though Botha stayed with the team for the rest of the season to assist with the transition. At the age of 21 he was the youngest captain of the South Australian side in their 122-year first-class history. As captain his fortunes continued to improve in the 2015‚Äì16 season as he shone in all three formats of the game. At the beginning of the season he became the third Australian in history to score a double century in a List A match with 202 runs from 120 balls. In doing so he helped South Australia to chase down the large target of 351 with three overs to spare. He also finally scored his maiden first-class century, after 17 scores of 50 or more, in a Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia to lead South Australia to a thrilling one-wicket win. On New Year's Eve he scored his maiden Twenty20 century against the Sydney Sixers, the first century ever scored for the Strikers. With three overs left in the match, the Strikers needed 51 runs to win and Head needed 55 runs to score his century. Head then scored 56 runs in the final three overs to score his century and win the match with three balls to spare, hitting Sean Abbott for three consecutive sixes in the last over. His final score was 101 runs off 53 balls with 9 sixes and 4 fours. Head's form was rewarded by national selectors when he was included in Australia's squad for a series of Twenty20 Internationals against India. He made his international debut during the series on Australia Day at his home ground, the Adelaide Oval. After the series he returned to the Sheffield Shield, scoring two more centuries, one against Western Australia to secure another one-wicket win and the other against Tasmania, scoring a career-best 192 to help give South Australia an innings victory in just two days. He led South Australia to their first Sheffield Shield final in 20 years and was named the Sheffield Shield Player of the Year, having scored 699 runs at an average of 38.83 before the final, which South Australia lost. Head was brought into Australia's One Day International (ODI) squad for the first time for a tri-series in the West Indies. He made his ODI debut on 13 June 2016 against the West Indies. After the tournament he joined the IPL team Royal Challengers Bangalore before going to England to play County cricket for Yorkshire. In his fourth match for Yorkshire he broke the club's record for the highest List A batting partnership, putting on 274 runs for the third wicket with Jack Leaning. Head scored 175 off 139 balls in the innings while Leaning also scored a century. He had to leave Yorkshire early when he was brought to Sri Lanka to train with Australia's Test squad and play in their ODI squad. Though he was originally not included in the squad, the selectors decided that they needed to give younger players more experience in Asian conditions after they had lost the first two matches of the Test series. =Opening stint and Champions Trophy (2016‚Äì2017)= As Head was part of Australia's squad for their tour of South Africa, he was unable to captain the Redbacks in the Matador Cup. He continued to play for Australia consistently in the 2016‚Äì17 season, but he was unable to make any big scores. Batting in the middle order he regularly scored above 30 runs, doing so nine times in fourteen innings before the end of 2016, but he was only able to score three half-centuries with a high score of 57 against New Zealand. For Australia's series against Pakistan in January 2017, Head was moved from the middle order to the top order, opening the batting. This resulted in Head scoring his maiden ODI century against Pakistan on Australia Day at Adelaide Oval. He opened with David Warner and the pair scored 284 runs for the first wicket, with Head scoring 128 himself. This stands as the highest partnership for any wicket for Australia and the second highest opening stand in ODIs. Despite his strong form in One Day Internationals and in domestic cricket, averaging over 60 in the 2016‚Äì17 Sheffield Shield season, Head was not included in Australia's Test squad for the 2017 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, though Australian coach Darren Lehmann said \\"We expect him in the not-too-distant future to get his chance in Test cricket.\\" Instead, Head continued to play for South Australia, who played in their second consecutive Sheffield Shield final. He scored a century but the Redbacks ultimately lost the match. When limited overs opener Aaron Finch returned to form, Head was dropped back to the middle order, though he remained in the Australian side for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. Due to weather neither of Australia's first two matches in the tournament were completed and Head did not get a chance to bat, but in Australia's only completed match, against hosts England, Head top scored for Australia with 71 not out in a losing effort. Head signed to play for Yorkshire again in the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast, but he pulled out of the tournament when he was named the captain of the Australia A side for the 2017 South Africa A Team Tri-Series. As a result of a pay dispute with Cricket Australia, the Australia A side pulled out of this tournament. Head started the 2017‚Äì18 Sheffield Shield season as one of many players in contention to take Australia's number 6 spot in the upcoming Ashes against England. In the first match of the season the Redbacks played against New South Wales, whose bowling attack made up the entire Australian bowling attack. Head did not impress selectors, only scoring totals of 8 and 0, but he bounced back with an impressive, measured half-century against Victoria and a century against Queensland. Regardless, he did not earn selection in Australia's Test team. When Brad Hodge left the Adelaide Strikers, Head replaced him as the team's captain, adding it to his captaincy of South Australia and making him the captain of the state's highest-level team in all three formats of the game. =Test debut and Vice-captaincy (2018‚Äìpresent)= In April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2018‚Äì19 season. In September 2018, he was named in Australia's Test squad for their series against Pakistan. He made his Test debut for Australia against Pakistan on 7 October 2018. He had his baggy green cap presented to him from Nathan Lyon. In January 2019, he was announced as Australia's new Test vice-captain, alongside Pat Cummins ahead of the series against Sri Lanka on 24 January. This was due to the unavailability of regular vice-captains, Mitchell Marsh who was omitted from the Test squad and Josh Hazlewood who was unavailable due to an injury. In the two-Test series, across three innings, Head scored 84, 161, and 59 not out to raise his Test match batting average to 51 and set a new Test high score. In July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in England. In November 2019, he was played against Pakistan in Australia, although he only batted once in the series. In December, he was named in Australia's squad for the Test Series against New Zealand. He made a century and was named player of the match in the second Test. On 16 July 2020, Head was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company held patents for digital shopping carts commonly used on e-commerce websites, such as Amazon.com and collected royalties on these patents, but ultimately their patents were invalidated. Soverain Software has been characterized as a patent troll. Soverain also claimed to own, sell, and maintain an enterprise software product called Transact, which, according to the company, had existed for nearly 18 years and had been used by over 1,000 customers in over 25 countries, including companies such as Time-Warner, AT&T;, Sony, Disney, BusinessWeek and Reuters. However, this is disputed, and no evidence that the company ever developed or sold software products is known to exist. History In 2003, Soverain Software acquired some of the assets of bankrupt Divine, a Chicago software firm which itself had acquired Open Market, a Boston internet startup, in 2001. Among the assets acquired were the e-commerce software product Transact, and various patents, including patents on the \\"electronic shopping cart\\" ‚Äì essentially, patents on the idea of having a \\"shopping cart\\" in which to save items to be purchased in a single transaction, rather than having to purchase each item as an individual transaction. Soverain did not further develop or market Transact, but instead focusing its business model on enforcing their patents. = Patent infringement lawsuits = On January 12, 2004, Soverain sued Amazon.com and Gap Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Gap settled with Soverain in February 2005 under undisclosed terms. In August that year, Amazon settled the case for $40 million. One of the patents involved a shopping cart mechanism used for online shopping. In 2010, Soverain Software filed a suit against several e-commerce companies, including Nordstrom, Macy's, Home Depot, Radioshack, Kohl's and Newegg alleging infringement of U.S. Patents No. , No. and No. which relate to the concept of a digital shopping cart, similar to the 2004 case. When the case went to court in 2010, all defendants except Newegg had settled. Initially, Newegg was found to have infringed the patents in suit and Soverain was awarded a judgement of $2.5 million fine instead of the $34 million claimed by Soverain. On January 22, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court and invalidated claims from all three asserted patents as being obvious in view of the prior art. The judgment against Newegg was vacated.In Soverain Software LLC v. Newegg Inc., No. 11-1009 (Fed. Cir.

Kaufman (born April 26, 1935) is an American record producer, tour manager, and author, best known for stealing the body of country musician Gram Parsons, and burning it in Joshua Tree National Monument. This was later chronicled in the film Grand Theft Parsons. He authored the book Road Mangler Deluxe, an autobiography about his experiences in the music business. He worked with Parsons, The Rolling Stones, Emmylou Harris, Joe Cocker, Frank Zappa, Hank Williams III, Etta James, and many more. Kaufman's first musical role was as the driver and assistant to The Rolling Stones during the recording of Beggar's Banquet, referred to by Mick Jagger as his \\"executive nanny.\\" Kaufman had previously acted in Hollywood, with bit parts in Spartacus, Riot in Juvenile Prison, and Pork Chop Hill, among others, before a felony marijuana smuggling conviction in the mid 1960s. After getting out of prison (where he befriended fellow inmate Charles Manson), he was offered a job driving for Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull, who were in Los Angeles at the time for the mixing of Beggars Banquet. Through Keith Richards, Kaufman met Gram Parsons, and agreed to tour manage his group The Flying Burrito Brothers, although he had no prior tour managing experience. The song \\"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?\\" from Frank Zappa's album Joe's Garage tells the story of Kaufman's \\"urination problems\\".YouTube Parsons' death After Parsons' death from an accidental drug overdose, Kaufman borrowed a hearse and drove to Los Angeles International Airport, convincing airline staff to release Parsons' body to him. According to Kaufman, he had made a pact with Parsons prior to his death regarding handling of their remains in the event of either Parsons' or Kaufman's death. The 2003 movie Grand Theft Parsons follows Kaufman taking Parsons' body and burning it in the desert, with Johnny Knoxville portraying Kaufman. Charles Manson Kaufman met Charles Manson while they were inmates in Terminal Island Prison. According to Kaufman, a guard taunted Manson that he would never get out; Manson calmly responded by looking up from his guitar and saying, \\"Get out of where?\\"Charles Manson By Simon WellsManson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson By Jeff Guinn p 74 (Manson officially requested a transfer to Leavenworth, considered one of the harshest penitentiaries, because he said he would get fewer complaints from fellow inmates about his guitar practicing there.) p 194-196 Manson, who aspired to success as a singer-songwriter was found to be congenial company by Kaufman. He thought Manson a very bad guitar player, but capable enough as a singer and songwriter to have a chance of getting a record contract, and before Manson's release Kaufman gave him the name of a friend in the industry, Gary Stromberg at Universal. Kaufman advised Manson wait a few months after he was released to give him a chance to acclimatize to the outside world, and do some more work on his songs, then use the most polished compositions to showcase his potential when he went to see the music producer acquaintance of Kaufman's, saying who sent him. Manson, who Kaufman believed was self- obsessed, promised to take the advice.Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson By Jeff Guinn p 74-5 Despite this valuable introduction for the furtherance of his ambitions, on release day Manson begged to stay and protested that prison had become his home. p199London Review of Books, London Review of Books The way out is not through the door Months after his release, by which time he had acquired the first four of his female devotees, Manson went to see Stromberg. On the strength of the recommendation from Kaufman, the producer authorized a studio recording session. Instead of having been prepared as Kaufman suggested, with a limited number of his best songs, Manson was unfocused and amateurish, making the recording a disappointment.Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson By Jeff Guinn p 124 Kaufman was released the next year, and would spend time living with the Manson Family, with its female devotees made available to him. According to Kaufman, he has \\"had sex with more serial killers than anyone else in Show Business.\\" When Manson found that he could not turn Kaufman into a follower, they became estranged. =Manson album= Kaufman produced and released Manson's album at the height of his notoriety, but found that he could not get anyone to stock Lie: The Love and Terror Cult.Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson By Jeff Guinn p 314 =Music industry and the Manson murders= Manson murder victims Leno and Rosemary LaBianca's home was next to where a long time close friend of Kaufman had rented a house. Manson had attended parties there with Kaufman when still friendly with him: Kaufman has said this was no coincidence.London Review of Books 7/11/ 13 Way Out The way out of a room is not through the door, Christian Lorentzen The murder of Sharon Tate and four others, which occurred on the previous night to the attack on the LaBianca home, was also linked with a music industry acquaintance of Manson who he associated with his failures to get a record contract. It was at the 10050 Cielo Drive former home of Terry Melcher, which by then was being rented by the husband of Sharon Tate. Manson had been rebuffed there while looking for Melcher, who had been initially interested in Manson's music but lost interest after a trip to the Manson commune. Prior to the killing of Tate and her four friends, Manson had initiated the murder spree of his followers by ordering the death of Gary Hinman. Mary Brunner was present throughout and the key witness for the prosecution at a trial of some Manson followers for the murder. She testified that Bobby Beausoleil killed Hinman, a musician, because Hinman had refused to join Manson's band.CieloDrive .com, retrieved 23/12/14 News report Wednesday, June 17th, 1970 Mary Brunner Indicted: Ex-Librarian Asks To Defend HerselfCieloDrive .com, retrieved 23/12/14 (News report) June 18th, 1970 Mary Brunner Arraigned In Musician Slaying Case References Category:American record producers Category:American male writers Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:1935 births ","title":"Phil Kaufman (producer)"},{"id":"38352703","title":"Chhavi Pandey"},{"id":"38352720","text":"Pia Juul (; 30 May 196230 September 2020) was a Danish poet, prose writer, and translator.

RGI among the first Caribbean entertainment and information broadcaster on the internet.  History  Radio Guyana International was founded by Chris Persaud (DJ Chris) who, at the time, was looking for a Guyanese entertainment on the internet or a radio station to listen, so he that could connect back to his origin of birth but could not find any. Chris thought that since he couldn't find any, it was best to create his own, and as a result Radio Guyana International was born. Chris then teamed up with long-time friends Mark Jacobs (Website Admin), Nevil Johnson (DJ Soca Devil), Cleon Lord (Hitman) Shivanand Singh (DJ Shivy of Orlando, Florida), Dj Raj (Raj Sookdeo)United Kingdom) and started RGI with the focus on all music genres, primarily Caribbean genres - Reggae, Dancehall, Soca, Chutney, Chutney Soca, Bollywood, and Calypso. Radio Guyana International was a weekend only station for the first year broadcasting Friday 6pm UK to Sunday 12 AM UK. This is because the Studio had one telephone line that was used for Dial up Internet in the early days. 6 Months later we added a second dedicated telephone line just for internet dial up and began broadcasting 24 hours a day 7days a week. During the week we ran a play list via a 500 Sony CD Juke Box and at weekend we broadcast live with our cd players and mixer in the small studio in London. In 2004 we upgraded the studio internet connection to Adsl +2 High speed internet and WIFI. This allowed us to have several computers in the studio to reply to listeners shoutouts and the operation of VoIP telephone systems to allow listeners to call into from the US, CA and UK. This proved to be very popular with our listeners around the world. in 2005 We Teamed up With Dj Ava, Dj Sam and DJ Dom from Guyana to bring live broadcast throughout the day and in the evening 98.1 Hot FM when out Dj's were not live on air. The broadcast was using Satellite Internet from Guyana as the Dsl connections from Guyana was very slow and very poor and give us a lot of issues. The Satellite Broadband was provided free of charge to Radio Guyana International. In 2008 We upgraded our computer system to go fully automated when our djs are not live at the weekend. This allowed us to add more music to our automation library and discontinue our cd Juke box system. 2010 Upgraded Studio Internet to Fiber Optic Broadband and upgraded Voip Telephone Systems with call que and music on hold systems.

As of 2019, Dara has won 4 medals at the Winter X Games. At the 2014 Winter Olympics Howell started competition as a gold medal threat together with compatriot Kaya Turski. Turski was favoured ahead of her but was sick on the day of competition and crashed out in both of her qualifying runs, failing to make the final. In the final Howell had a successful first run scoring a 94.2, a run and score which would hold up as the eventual gold medal winner. Kim Lamarre a fellow Canadian finished in third to complete another two medal event for Canada at those Olympics. Howell, like many of the Canadian women in freestyle competition was close to freestyle skier Sarah Burke, who died while on a training run a few years before the sport was inaugurated as an Olympic event. Burke had coached Howell at Momentum Ski Camps in Whistler Blackcomb. She dedicated her victory to Burke saying \\"Oh, my God. I don't know what to say. I can't believe it. It is so surreal and I am so happy to win a gold medal for Canada. I don't think it will hit me until later. It is truly amazing. There are a number of really good girls out there and I came out on top. This is the best moment in my entire life...I said it earlier this week, I hope a Canadian brings home a gold medal for Sarah. I can't believe it's me. It's totally for Sarah and I cannot believe it.\\" Even though she was struggling with injuries and personal pressures after the 2014 Sochi Olympics, Dara still qualified and competed for Canada at the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea. Dara's 2018/2019 was derailed by an injury at the Big Air World Cup in New Zealand, resulting in a torn anterior cruciate knee ligament.https://www.fis-ski.com/en/freestyle-freeski/freeski/news- multimedia/news-multimedia/news/dara-howell-sidelined-by-injury-for- the-2018-2019-season The injury required surgery, and Dara missed the rest of the season while she recovered.

It was published by Michael Joseph in November 1938, and according to the publisher's list belongs in the category of belles lettres. It was one of four books by Louis MacNeice to appear in 1938, along with The Earth Compels, I Crossed the Minch and Modern Poetry: A Personal Essay. Zoo is primarily a book about London Zoo. During the writing of the book, from May to August 1938, Louis MacNeice was living in Primrose Hill Road, London, in a maisonette overlooking Primrose Hill and a short distance from London Zoo. (In the last chapter of the book, MacNeice notes that: \\"As I write this on Primrose Hill I can hear the lions roaring in the Zoo.\\") According to the blurb on the flap of the dust jacket, Zoo \\"contains impressions of the Zoo from a layman's point of view, and impressions of the visitors; information about the keepers and feeding of the animals (and visitors); discussion of the Zoo's architecture and general organisation; and special studies of animals.\\" The book also contains descriptions of Whipsnade Zoo, Bristol Zoo and the new Paris Zoo in the Bois de Vincennes, together with a number of \\"digressions\\" - short descriptions of the lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, cricket matches at Lord's, and a week-end visit to Northern Ireland. Zoo is illustrated with drawings, mainly in carbon pencil, by the English artist Nancy Coldstream (later Nancy Spender), under her maiden name of Nancy Sharp. Nancy Coldstream had earlier provided illustrations for I Crossed the Minch, a book on the Hebrides by Louis MacNeice. Zoo was a Book Society Recommendation and, as Jon Stallworthy notes in his biography of Louis MacNeice, it \\"sold well enough, though much less well than Modern Poetry.\\" Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice. London: Faber and Faber, 1995. Paperback edition 1996, p. 231. Background Zoo began as a commission from the publisher Michael Joseph for a book on the subject of London Zoo. \\"Designed for the armchair reader, this was to be more impressionistic than Julian Huxley's Official Guide to the Zoo.\\" Jon Stallworthy: Louis MacNeice, p. 225. In May 1938 MacNeice moved into 16a Primrose Hill Road, London, a short distance from London Zoo, and in the course of the next three months he made many visits to the Zoo. These visits are often recorded in the book in diary-style entries: \\"On June 1st I visited Regent's Park, a cold morning, June avenging the inopportune warmth of March. But the silver foxes were boxing and the mongooses making love in their straw.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo. London: Michael Joseph, 1938, p. 93. \\"June 7th, Whit Tuesday, was fine and sunny. The Daily Sketch had out a poster - \\"R.A.F. Boxers Missing in Country of Savage Apes\\" - and the Zoo in the morning was full of people on holiday... The animals were far outnumbered and their occasional croaks and whimperings drowned in a torrent of words.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo, pp. 94-95. \\"June 9th was a fresh morning, gay with farmyard cluckings and the crisp yelps of sea-lions. On the Mappin Terraces the bears were lively, stalking on their hind legs and looking for buns which were not, for people had gone back to work. On one of the top crags a goat sat motionless in profile like an acroterion on the ruin of a Greek temple.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo, p. 97. MacNeice worked on Zoo, writing little else, through June, July and the first half of August 1938, taking the occasional break to watch tennis at Wimbledon or cricket at Lord's. These breaks are also described in the book. On June 22 MacNeice went to the lawn tennis championships at Wimbledon, where he watched the American tennis player Helen Wills Moody in a second-round game against Nell Hall Hopman. Helen Wills Moody went on to win the Women's Singles at the 1938 Wimbledon Championships, but MacNeice was \\"very disappointed\\" with her playing style: \\"She plays like any other woman in a tournament, cautiously retrieving and retrieving, never going up to the net.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo, p. 156. On July 27 \\"I did not go to the Zoo, but, as I was about to enter my house, I saw someone watching the door whom I did not want to meet, so I changed my course and went to Lord's. There my old school, Marlborough, were playing their annual match with Rugby, a match which I had never yet watched. The game was a dull game, but I met a number of old boys and we stood each other beer in glaring sun.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo, pp. 216-217. The final chapter of the book, 'Whipsnade and Last Words', describes a visit to Whipsnade Zoo on August 18, 1938, and a last visit to London Zoo on a wet Wednesday evening a few days before. After the manuscript was delivered to its publisher, MacNeice went on holiday to Hampshire, where he began his long poem Autumn Journal. Some phrases and images from Zoo reappear in Autumn Journal: \\"As I write this on Primrose Hill I can hear the lions roaring in the Zoo\\" (Zoo) becomes \\"When the lions roar beneath the hill\\" (Autumn Journal, ii). The literary critic Samuel Hynes, writing in the London Review of Books,London Review of Books, 2 March 1989. quotes the following passage from Zoo to illustrate how MacNeice commonly presented himself as a lover of ordinary pleasures: \\"The pleasure of dappled things, the beauty of adaptation to purpose, the glory of extravagance, classic elegance or romantic nonsense and grotesquerie ‚Äì all these we get from the Zoo. We react to these with the same delight as to new potatoes in April speckled with chopped parsley or to the lights at night on the Thames of Battersea Power House, or to cars sweeping their shadows from lamp-post to lamp-post down Haverstock Hill or to brewer‚Äôs drays or to lighthouses and searchlights or to a newly cut lawn or to a hot towel or a friction at the barber‚Äôs or to Moran‚Äôs two classic tries at Twickenham in 1937 or to the smell of dusting-powder in a warm bathroom or to the fun of shelling peas into a china bowl or of shuffling one‚Äôs feet through dead leaves when they are crisp or to the noise of rain or the crackling of a newly lit fire or the jokes of a street-hawker or the silence of snow in moonlight or the purring of a powerful car.\\" Louis MacNeice: Zoo, pp. 40-41. Contents Zoo contains the following chapters: # In Self-Defence # The Zoo and London # Layout # Wild and Domestic # A Personal Digression # Impressions: Early June # The Annual Report # Impressions: Middle June # Question and Answer # Impressions: Later June # The Aquarium # Impressions: July # More Impressions: July # Zoos in Paris # Whipsnade and Last Words Reception Jon Stallworthy, in his biography of Louis MacNeice, comments on the book as follows: \\"Written to much the same recipe as Letters from Iceland and I Crossed the Minch, Zoo is less successful than its predecessors. An early chapter, 'The Zoo and London', shows MacNeice the philosopher-poet at his zestful best, but much of what follows is undistinguished journalism, and there are no poems.\\" Notes Category:1938 non-fiction books Category:Books by Louis MacNeice Category:London Zoo Category:Michael Joseph books ","title":"Zoo (book)"},{"id":"38352844","text":"One Night in Lisbon is a 1941 American thriller film directed by Edward H.

Plot Dwight Houston (Fred MacMurray), an American pilot from Texas pilot, meets a British aristocrat in London amid bombing, and gets caught up in a Nazi spy plot in Portugal. At first Houston is critical of Britain, due to what he perceives to be a condescending attitude on the part of Leonora Perrycaote (Madeleine Carroll); however, he soon realizes in fact that as American he has much in common with them, and that their fight is his fight, remarking poignantly that \\"It's funny about England and the way Americans feel about you. It's sort of like being related in a way. You know the way you feel about relatives. They do a lot of things that irritate you, but when it comes right down to it, you are related.

These beetles roll a ball of dung for some distance from where it was deposited, and bury it, excavating an underground chamber to house it. An egg is then laid in the ball, the growing larva feeding on the dung, pupating, and eventually emerging as an adult. Navigation In a study by Marie Dacke published in the journal Current Biology, it is reported that researchers have found that beetles of this species use the bright glow from the Milky Way to navigate during night- time operations. Vertebrates such as humans, birds and seals are known to navigate in this way, but this could be the first insect found to do the same. Previous experiments showed that these beetles are able to steer by light from the Sun, the Moon, and polarised light emanating from these light sources. It was their ability to stay on course on clear moonless nights that puzzled researchers. Beetles were taken into the Johannesburg Planetarium where the appearance of the apparent sky could be controlled. To ensure that they were not using cues on the horizon, they were placed in a container with blackened walls. The beetles navigated best when exposed to a clear starry sky, but managed equally well when only the diffuse band of the Milky Way Galaxy was visible. It is undoubted that many other animals make use of similar techniques, some frogs, bats, moths and spiders being likely candidates.

Dohas of Kabir, Tulsidas, Raskhan, Rahim and the dohas of Nanak called Sakhis are famous. Satasai of Hindi poet, BihƒÅrƒ´, contains many dohas. Dohas are written even now. Background Doha is a very old \\"verse-format\\" of Indian poetry. It is an independent verse, a couplet, the meaning of which is complete in itself. As regards its origin, Hermann Jacobi had suggested that the origin of doha can be traced to the Greek Hexametre, that it is an amalgam of two hexametres in one line. This format had found favour with the Abhiras or Ahirs who had greatly encouraged its use, the Abhiras belonged to Gandhara region now in Pakistan. Jacobi's theory rests on the premise that the Indians possessed a translation of Homer's works as asserted by Dio of Alexandria. Therefore, for a very long time the Doha verse-format was popularly used in Gujarati, Rajasthani (Duha), Maithili, Marathi and Hindi folk and modern literature of North India and in Sindhi (Doho) literature of Pakistan. The word Doha is supposed to have derived from the Sanskrit words dogdhaka, dvipadi, dvipathaka or dodhaka that are all Sanskrit couplet forms; it is also known as duhaviya in Apabhra·πÉ≈õa to which the earliest reference is in Vikramorvashiyam of Kalidasa. Dohas have also been found written and cited in a stray manner in older languages such as Prakrit and Pali. They are quotations of worldly wisdom. In Duhasuktavali it is said that doha should be quoted where talented persons have gathered. Doha (Apabhra·πÉ≈õa) is a particular kind of Apabhra·πÉ≈õa metre of popular origin that was cultivated by many Apabhra·πÉ≈õa saints ‚Äì poets and bards owing to its lyrical qualities, and who gave birth to the Doha ‚Äì sahitya i.e. Doha-literature. Dohas in Sant literature are known as Sakhis.A doha has two lines, each having 13+11 morae (6+4+3) + (6+4+1) and with its last words ending in a rhyme; it is one of the shortest quantitative metres of Hindi literature. This format has been employed freely since 6th century AD and are seen quoted by Svayambhudeva (circa 800 AD) in his Paumachariu and Harivamshapurana and by Hemchandra (1088‚Äì1172) of Patan (Gujarat) in his Siddhahema shabdanushashna, a work on grammar of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhra·πÉ≈õa. The great saint-poet Gorakhnath (809‚Äì849) for his Gorakh-bani and the great poet Pushpadanta (959‚Äì972) of Manyakheta for his epics Mahapurana, Nayakumara-chariu, Adipurana, Jaisahara- chariu and Uttarapurana chose this particular format. Compositions There was a tradition of composing stray verses in Doha metre, more popular in North India it was popularised through contributions made by the Jainas, the Brahmins and the Muslims as is seen in epic, rasa and didactic type of literature. Topics in this literature include eroticism, valour, quietude, morality, common life, eventful scenes, of nature, sayings and proverbs. Some main literary works of the period from the 8th to 13th centuries are Sarasvatikanthabharana and Shringaraprakasha of Bhoja, Kavyalankara of Rudrta, Prakritavyakrana of Hemchandra, Prakritapaingalam and Neminathachariu of Haribhadra, Kumarapalapratibodha of Somaprabha, Prabandhachintamani of Merutanga, Sandeshrasaka of Abdul Rahman. Religious doha-literature was composed by Buddhists, Jainas and Shaivas which was both, spiritual and moralist. The spiritual doha-literature is devoid of artificial style and is mystico-religious in which symbols are employed and importance of teacher- preacher is emphasised; its authors were saints first and poets afterwards. Its poetic value though not high was sincere in feelings and emotions. Natha, Santa, Sahajiya and Vaishnava schools were then very popular. Buddhist contribution It is traditionally held that Bauddha-dohas were composed by the eighty-four Bauddha Siddhas. Buddhist or bauddha-dohas of Sarahapa (760‚Äì806), Sabarapa, Luipa, Darikapa, Kanhapa and ≈öƒÅntipa, all belonging to the period from the 8th to 12th centuries, are of two types ‚Äì a) that which establishes and explains sectarian teachings and philosophy, and b) that which criticises Rituals, tantricism and mantravada; both represent two modes viz., Vajrayana (thunder-bolt) describing spiritual states and experiences, and Sahajayana (natural and easy) preaching purification of life and criticise Hindu and Jaina practices, Jaina contribution Jaina doha-literature mainly deals with spiritualism and the supreme self, internal purification, control of the mind and the senses and opposes external ritualism, charms, tantricism, worship of deities and scriptures. Some important Jaina works are Pramatamaprakasha and Yogasara of Joindu Yogindra, Prabhritadoha of Ramasimha, Vairagyasara of Suprabhacharya and Dohaprabhrita of Muni Mahachandra. Didactic dohas of Jainas preach the need to raise the moral standard of life, lay stress on duties and obligations, charity etc., Shavakadharmadoha of Devasena of Dhar (9th century AD) and Sanjama-manjari of Maheshvarasuri belong to this kind. Brahmanical contribution Brahmanical doha-literature is available in Tantrasara and Pratrimshikavrriti of Abhinavagupta which are Sanskrit texts on Kashmiri Shaivism. Hindi dohas Hindi doha is matrik-ardha-sama-chhanda metre and have odd and even feet of the same rhythm but the attempt to find a proper identification of the rhythm is evident in all works from Chhandamala of Keshavdas (1557‚Äì1637) to Chhanda-prabhakara of Jagannathprasad Bhanu (1859‚Äì1945). Hindi doha-literature is marked by Pahur-doha of the Jain-muni Ram Singh, Bhaviayatt-kaha of Dhanapala, Sandesha-rasaka of Abdul Rahman and Prithviraj Raso of Chand Bardai, and later by works of Khusro, Kabir, Tulsidas, Nanak, Dadu Dayal, Malukdas, Malik Mohammad Jayasi, Raskhan and Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana. Kabir and Tulsidas used the Maithili doha metre, and the great Chishti Sufi shaykh of the thirteenth century Baba Farid (Farid ud Din Ganj-i Shakar; d. 1265) is widely remembered today for his Punjabi dohas. Sindhi dohos Doha or Doho is an important part of Sindhi literature. M.Jotwani had traced the Arabic two-lined Beit to the likes of doha, baro doha soratha and tunveri duho. The main strain of Sindhi literature has been Sufi- Vedantic poetry in the form of doha or beit that could be sung.

It was planned to be constructed on a viaduct on New Lane south of Leeds city centre, the River Aire and Leeds City station to which it would be connected by an elevated walkway. The site is occupied by Central Park, a small low-rise office park built in the 1990s and other small office buildings. Whilst originally the preferred station option, a November 2015 review of the phase two route instead proposed that the Leeds HS2 platforms should join onto the side of the existing Leeds station. Unlike New Lane, this will provide a common concourse for easy interchange between high speed and classic rail services. Background In 2009, the Labour Government created High Speed Two Ltd to examine the prospect of further high-speed rail in the United Kingdom. Later in 2010, the Coalition Government confirmed there would be a terminus in both Leeds and Manchester. In January 2013 the final route was announced with a new station being proposed for Leeds and a new station adjacent to Piccadilly station for the terminus in Manchester. Both Leeds and Manchester were to have junctions to the south of the cities allowing for connections to the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line respectively. Proposal New Lane in April 2010 Publication of the proposed route on 28 January 2013 showed that the Leeds station would be a new terminus connected to Leeds City station by airport- style pedestrian walkways, possibly with moving walkways. The configuration and design of the station has not been confirmed. New Lane is quarter of a mile south of Leeds station and is a cul-de-sac in the centre of a gyratory, containing a small business park. There is no railway infrastructure at the site. Previously there were railways to the west with a goods yard at Crown Point (see Leeds Hunslet Lane railway station) and mineral lines to transport coal to Meadow Lane Gas Works. The site is next to Bridgewater Place and close to Holbeck Urban Village and the M621 motorway. =Proposed facilities= Few details of the proposed facilities have been released, however the Department for Transport have confirmed car parking will be provided to the south of the site. The station will link to Leeds station which has ticket offices, car parks, a bus interchange and two concourses containing retail, restaurant and licensed facilities. There are currently proposals to expand these facilities. With the link this will enable facilities to be shared by the two stations. The plans released appear to show the New Lane site with a sizeable concourse. Public transport First Leeds bus routes run around the gyratory and there are stops on Victoria Road and Meadow Lane. Both the formerly proposed Leeds Supertram and Leeds Trolleybus routes would have passed within half a mile of the site. Location in Leeds and on HS2 The proposed location of Leeds New Lane (black:tracks, red:pedestrian walkway, grey:station area) The plans show the tracks approaching the station from the south-east, parallel to the Pontefract Line and then the M621, coming through Meadow Lane Gas Works and Leeds City Business Park, with the station on a viaduct which spreads from the centre of the gyratory through the Leeds City Business Park site: the viaduct would extend 290m beyond the station buildings. This would mean the relocation of several businesses, a Leeds City Council depot and a natural gas storage facility consisting of two low-pressure gas holders.https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69036/hs2-arp- lr0-dr-rt-55222_3-0.pdf File:MeadowLaneGas.jpgThe Meadow Lane gas holders are in the path of the development File:British Gas Offices - Kidacre Street - geograph.org.uk - 986188.jpgThe Leeds City Business Park, also in the path of the development Withdrawal of preferred status In November 2015 an interim report on the Leeds HS2 station location was published. This stated that New Lane was no longer the preferred station location, as it would be too detached from the existing Leeds station and too isolated from the city centre. Instead it recommends that a different location for the HS2 platforms be found which shares a common concourse with the existing Leeds station. The suggested location has the platforms connect to the existing station building across the river from the South, creating a 'T' shape.

Tennis career At the age of 20 he became the Catalan champion by winning both the singles and doubles with his brother in the Barcelona tournament (He repeated his doubles feat again in 1914). The same year he won the Homburg Cup by defeating the three-times defending champion and Germany's top player Otto Froitzheim. He also became Austrian Champion after claiming the Austrian International Championships in Vienna. In September 1910 he won the singles title at the Montreux Tournament after defeating R. Norris Williams in the final in five sets. In 1911 he won several French Riviera mixed doubles titles pairing Hedwig Neresheimer. He also retained his Austrian title. In the South of France championships he and Max Decugis lost the doubles final to Tony Wilding and Josiah Ritchie. In the Menton tournament he was defeated again by the former team in the doubles championships match partnering his brother Robert. In 1913 he won the South of France Championships doubles (also the mixed doubles) and the Monte Carlo Cup alongside Friedrich Wilhelm Rahe who later became his partner for the 1913 Wimbledon Championships doubles final which they subsequently lost. In major tournaments, Kleinschroth reached the quarter-finals of the World Covered Court Championships in 1913 and the quarter-finals of the World Hard Court Championships in both 1912 and 1913. He was on the Germany Davis Cup team several times, including Germany's World Group semi-final and Inter-Zonal final showings in 1913 and 1929 respectively. A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph ranked Kleinschroth as World No. 9 in 1914. During World War I he fought in the Western Front and fell into captivity in France. He was the manager/coach of Gottfried von Cramm and Henner Henkel and the Germany Davis Cup team in the 1930s. Heinrich's brother, Robert Kleinschroth, also competed on the amateur tour, reaching the semi-finals of the World Hard Court Championships in 1912. He was a Juris Doctor, a degree he earned at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and used that title later on and registered as such for tournaments. In his post-retirement years in the 60s he worked for the International Tennis Federation management committee and also was a part of a subcommittee dedicated to work on the possible merging of amateur and professional tennis scene, a project that came to life just a year after.

The centre was founded in 1973, with financing primarily from Kuwait.Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research (IHERI-AB) It was named after 17th-century Timbuktu scholar Ahmad Baba al Massufi. Building The current building was designed by a South-African architect and finished in 2009, costing around 5.8 million euros. It has an area of 4,600 sq metres and includes an air conditioning system for the proper preservation of the manuscripts housed in it, as well as an automatic fire-fighting system. It replaced a 40-year-old crumbling building. Manuscripts The centre holds approximately 20,000 manuscripts covering Mali's history, including the Tarikh al-Sudan. The majority of the manuscripts are from the 14th to 16th centuries, and most are written in Arabic but others are in local languages, such as Songhai, Tamashek and Bamanankan, or even in more distant ones, one each in Turkish and Hebrew, with topics covering medicine, astronomy, poetry, literature and Islamic law. A program to digitize the manuscripts is under way, run by Norway and Luxembourg under UNESCO supervision, with only a fraction of them having been scanned as of January 2013. Arson On January 28, 2013, as French-led Malian troops captured the airport of Timbuktu, fleeing Tuareg Islamists set fire to the building which they had been using as sleeping quarters. Before and during the occupation, more than 300,000 Timbuktu Manuscripts from the Institute and from private libraries were saved and moved to more secure locations. In July 2014 UNESCO joined the Ahmed Baba Institute in an urgent appeal for financial assistance to preserve, restore, and digitize the manuscripts.

He is an Associate Professor for New Media and Digital Culture and directs the Utrecht Data School. Biography Sch√§fer studied theater, media and communication studies at the University of Vienna and digital culture at Utrecht University. He obtained a Ph.D. in 2008 at Utrecht University. Sch√§fer's research revolves around technology and how they transform society. He publishes on digital culture, cultural theory and new media. In 2011 he was awarded a fellowship at the University of Applied Arts Vienna where he investigates artistic technology research. He has been a research fellow at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Humanities at Utrecht University and a Mercator Research Fellow at the NRW School of Governance. Research activity Sch√§fer conducted research on hacker communities, user participation and their impact on cultural industries.Mirko Tobias Schaefer: Bastard Culture! How User Participation Transforms Cultural Production, Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press 2011. In stark contrast to the general field of new media studies his research on participatory culture provides a critical deconstruction of user participation. Coining the term of an extended culture industry he builds upon the cultural critique of the Frankfurt School, most notably Adorno and Horkheimer. Developing the concept of an extended culture industry, Sch√§fer could show to what extent appropriation of design by users is embedded into corporate production. Through distinguishing user participation into explicit participation and implicit participation, Sch√§fer delivers a terminology to separate conscious and active user engagement from user activities that are channeled by user interface design.Nico Carpentier in European Journal for Communication http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/27/2/211.extract Sch√§fer's contribution to the field of participatory culture was his distinction of implicit and explicit participation.Participatory culture#Explicit and implicit participation Explicit participation refers to the conscious activities of cultural production and social interaction as it has been covered by Henry Jenkins in his work on fan culture. Implicit participation refers to the subtle ways of channeling user activities through interface design. Sch√§fer considers strategies of implicit participation as key aspect in popular social media applicationParticipation Inside? User Activities between Design and Appropriation.

Tracing New Media in Everday Life and Technology, Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2009, pp. 147-158 He argues that media practices that had been developed in using the world wide web, now are implemented in easy to use interfaces and new business models. Sch√§fer's analysis of participatory culture depicts an accurate \\"shift within the commercial media industries to embrace certain conceptions of the fan as an idealized consumer of transmedia entertainment.\\"Henry Jenkins (2013): Rethinking 'Rethinking Convergence Culture', Cultural Studies, 28 May 2013 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.801579#.UdvLfW3_geQ Sch√§fer investigates how social media platforms affect practices of political organization. In his analysis, Sch√§fer focuses on the role of user interface design, platform governance and methods of controlling and channeling user activities.Sch√§fer in an interview with Henry Jenkins http://henryjenkins.org/2013/05/bastard-culture-an-interview-with-mirko- tobias-schafer-part-two.html His recent research is situated in the emerging field of critical data studies and revolves around investigating the impact of data practices on citizenship and democracy. Utrecht Data School Together with Thomas Boeschoten, at the time MA student, Sch√§fer founded the Utrecht Data School in 2013. It is a platform for teaching data analysis and digital methods. Initially a lack of funding pushed the founders to reach out to external partners, e.g. corporations, government organisations and NGO's, to finance the courses through commissioned research projects. That allowed them and their students to work on actual projects and experience how datafication manifests and transforms organisations. Consequently, the Utrecht Data School developed services and products that would enable researchers to enter societal fields as \\"experts and not as mere researchers.\\"Mirko Tobias Sch√§fer and Gerwin van Schie: Utrecht Data School.

They practice their skills through working on an applied research project in cooperation with an external partner of the school. The Data Ethics Decision Aid (DEDA) is an ethical impact assessment for data projects.

The house was constructed in 1771 of red brick and stone on rising ground. It consisted of two storeys, having a seven bay frontage with a central three bay pediment. History Thomas Clayton of Adlington, aged 57 (1688) The Adlington manor estate previously belonged to the Adlington family. On the death of Peter Adlington it was sold in 1688 to Thomas Clayton. Thomas Clayton died in 1722 and the estate descended to his grandson Richard Clayton, who was MP and Recorder for Wigan and Chief Justice of Common Pleas in Ireland. On the latter's death in 1770 it passed to his nephew, Sir Richard Clayton, the consul at Nantes, who was created a baronet in 1774. Sir Richard built the present Georgian style house in 1771 to replace an ancient timber and plaster house on the same site. Sir Richard died in 1828 and the estate was inherited by his daughter Henrietta, who had married General Robert Browne. He assumed the Clayton name in addition to his own. Their son, Richard Clayton Browne-Clayton, died in November 1886. His only son died at Sevastopol and Adlington Hall passed to James Robert Browne Clayton Dawbeny. After the Claytons the hall was occupied in turn by John Gerrard, a cotton manufacturer and Benjamin Davies, owner of the Huyton Bleachworks. In 1921 the hall and 129 acres of land were bought by Wigan Corporation to protect the town's water supply, as it was adjacent to the existing water catchment area. During the 1930s the family of Monks- Gaskell lived at the hall and during the Second World War it was used to house Spanish soldiers who had fled to England after the Spanish Civil War. The hall was demolished in the 1960s and the site is now occupied by a poultry farm. Two lodges and the entrance pillars originally survived, but one lodge has since been replaced by a modern house.

It was directed by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn. Plot Raden Ajeng Karina is of mixed-descent, born to a Dutch mother ‚Äì who has since returned to the Netherlands ‚Äì and Javanese father. She lives in the palace at Yogyakarta and must integrate herself with the majority Javanese society. In doing so she wears traditional clothes such as the kebaya. She later becomes involved in a love triangle with a foreign representative stationed in the city and his wife. Production Karina's Zelfopoffering was directed by Ph. Carli, who had been trained as a documentary filmmaker and had made his feature film debut two years earlier with De Stem des Bloeds. It starred his wife, Annie Krohn. Production was handled by Carli's Bandung-based company, Kinowerk Carli. One of the film's posters advertised \\"the most brilliant dancing and richest staging ever seen in a film from the Indies\\". This same poster gave the cast as including Jean de la Motte, W. Batten, Lucy Kay, Erna Zwartjes, and Pola du Moulin. An announcement in the Medan-based daily De Soematra Post, meanwhile, records all actors except Krohn as natives. Release and reception Karina's Zelfopoffering was released in 1932, having its premiere at Elita Theatre in Bandung. It had reached Medan by 30 January 1933. The film was a commercial failure. However, it received positive reviews. One in a local newspaper, Java Bode, praised Krohn's performance, finding that ‚Äì although all actors had done well ‚Äì she had been exceptional. According to Biran, these positive reviews were likely for advertising revenue; he notes that one positive review was reprinted with two pages of advertisements. Karina's Zelfopoffering proved to be Carli's last film in the Indies. He left the colony soon afterwards and went to the Netherlands. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

On 22 December 2011 he was appointed Minister of Education, Culture and Sports by the president of the Spanish Government, Mariano Rajoy. He resigned on June 25, 2015, and was replaced by √ç√±igo M√©ndez de Vigo.  Biography  Jos√© Ignacio Wert attended the Colegio Santa Mar√≠a del Pilar,http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2015/07/13/luis-de-guindos_n_7786082.html in Madrid. He got the best academic record of his promotion in Law Degree at the Complutense, full of Honours and he obtained the Extraordinary Prize of Degree and a master's degree in Political Sociology from the Institute of Political Studies. In 1979 he entered Spanish Radio and Television Corporation by state exam for upper-level university graduates, initially as a technologist, and subsequently as deputy director of the Audience Research cabinet. He taught Communication Theory in the Faculty of Information Sciences at the Complutense University of Madrid. He was a member of the Democratic Left (Spain) until 1977, when he left the party to join Union of Democratic Center, holding political positions in several public bodies. In 1978 he was appointed Head of the Studies Service, on which both the Studies of Content and the Audience Research cabinets depended. In 1979 he was appointed Assistant Director-General of the Technical Cabinet of Centro de Investigaciones Sociol√≥gicas (CIS), the Spanish agency for sociological research, a body that reported to the Presidency of the Government. In 1980, the Senate appointed him member of the Advisory Council of the Spanish Radio and Television Corporation, on a proposal from the UCD. Between 1974 and 1978 he taught Political Sociology in the Faculty of Economic Science at the Autonomous University of Madrid. During the crisis within the UCD, Wert become a member of the Democratic Popular Party, being one of the components of its National Executive Commission. In the municipal elections of 1983, his party appointed him as a member of the People's Coalition nomination (the coalition of People's Alliance, the PDP and the Liberal Union) for Madrid. He was then elected councilor of the Madrid City Council. He was in the city council until the 1986 general elections, when he was elected deputy for A Coru√±a, as PDP candidate in the Popular Coalition lists again. In 1986 he resigned his seat to work in various positions within the private sector, especially in polling firms, and an audience measurement firm. In 2003 he started to work for the BBVA, as deputy to the President of the bank, Francisco Gonz√°lez, acting as BBVA Group's Director of Corporate Relations. From 2003 to 2005, he presided the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), in representation of the BBVA. After leaving BBVA, he was named president of Inspire Consultores.  Minister of Education, Culture and Sport  On 22 December 2011 he was appointed Spanish Minister of Education, Culture and Sport. On 31 January 2012 his reform project for the general secondary education is announced. According to it, the compulsory secondary education would be reduced to one year, going from 4 years to 2 years, the Romanian Baccalaureate would increase by one year, rising from 2 to 4 years. This requires removing the fourth year of secondary education. The trade unions don't agree with that measure, as they fear a covert process of privatization. Other sectors, such as part of the teachers, have complained about its huge costs and the uncertain of its efficacy. Apparently, this reform would link with the LOCE, passed by the former government of the PP, presided by Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, but that was never applied due to Zapatero's arrival in government, who finally passed a new Organic Law on Education. One of the decisions he took was to subsidize again the Biographical Spanish Dictionary, published by the Spanish Royal Academy of History (with 193,000 euros), in spite of the controversy caused by some of the entries, such as the one devoted to General Francisco Franco, whom his biographer doesn't call dictator and also makes no reference to much of the period of repression. In July 2011, the Congress of Deputies passed a motion calling for the withdrawal of funds for the Biographical Spanish Dictionary if the failures were not corrected effectively. A month before, the Spanish Royal Academy of History had been forced to create a commission to report possible errors; but on 26 May 2012, according to El Pa√≠s, the Academy decided (without revealing the conclusions of its commission) not to either correct any biography or write alternative biographies to the ones already published, and that there would be only minor changes in a final addendum, and that there would be no modifications to the online version. He resigned on 25 June 2016, to become the Spanish ambassador to the OECD. =The replacement of the Education for Citizenship= On 31 January 2012, Jos√© Ignacio Wert announced that the subject Education for Citizenship, which was severely criticized by the Catholic Church and by the Partido Popular itself, would be replaced by another subject, called Civil and Constitutional education that, according to the minister, would be \\"free of controversial issues\\" and won't be \\"capable of any ideological recruitment\\". The Catholic parents' associations were in favor of this measure. According to El Pa√≠s, the new contents elude homophobia and social inequalities, but include denunciations of the so-called \\"exclusionary nationalism\\". Furthermore, the new contents emphasize the importance of private economic activity as a factor \\"in the creation of wealth\\", and also promote the respect for \\"intellectual property\\". =The cuts and the general strike in the public education sector on 22 May 2012= On 17 May 2012, the Congress of Deputies ratified, supported exclusively by the deputies of the People's Party, the government decree cutting public expenditure on education and health, estimated at over 10,000 million euros (7,200 in Health and 3,700 in Education), to meet the deficit target set by the European Union. On 22 May 2012, a general strike supported by all sectors of education (from nursery school through university) took place. This was the first unitary strike in the education sector in the history of Spain. Organized by the teacher unions and the student organizations, it was a protest against the Ministry of Education's latest measures that, they claimed, endangered the future of public education. The objective of the measures is, according to Wert, to reduce the education costs to meet the deficit target set by the European Union. Among the most noteworthy of these measures are an increase in the number of pupils per classroom (from 25 to 30 pupils in primary school, from 30 to 36 in secondary school and from 35 to 42 in the Baccalaureatenot cited). Other measures include the increase in the number of teaching hours (added to the cuts in teachers' salaries decreed by most of the autonomous communities); the decision of not covering sick leave that lasts less than 15 days, and a raise in university fees. The introduction of fees as high as 350 euros for Advanced Level Vocation Training programs. The following day the rectors of the public universities boycotted the Universities' Council meeting called by the Minister Wert, in protest against the exclusion from the agenda of the day of about the rise in university fees or the cost-cutting measures that involve the University.

Dredging and shell collection In 1834, MacAndrew joined the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, where he met other naturalists. During the early 1830s his interest in natural history, especially shells, and he began to amass a collection. His many business trips to Spain, Portugal and the Mediterranean led to his interest in the collection of shells from the sea shore, and MacAndrew subsequently undertook a series of research trips dredging for shells around the coast of Britain and Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Norway and finally to the Red Sea at the Gulf of Suez. MacAndrew met Edward Forbes, one of the founders of deep-sea marine biology research and through Forbes, MacAndrew met other naturalists who were interested in dredging, who worked for the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including John Goodsir FRS (1814‚Äì1867), James Smith FRS (\\"of Jordanhill\\") (1782‚Äì1867), and the foremost conchologist of his day, John Gwyn Jeffreys FRS (1809‚Äì1885). Membership of learned societies Isleworth, All Saints churchyard He was elected Fellow of the Linnean Society of London on 6 April 1847. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 2 June 1853. From 1856 to 1857 he was President of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool. In 1858 MacAndrew was elected Chairman of the newly formed General Dredging Committee, which he held for two years until he was replaced in 1861 by John Gwyn Jeffreys. In 1867, MacAndrew retired from his business interests. In 1872, together with Arturo Issel (1842‚Äì1922), he was awarded the 'Prix Savigny' of the French Academy of Sciences for his work on Testaceous Mollusca of the Gulf of Suez. Donation of collections to Cambridge University The bulk of the current mollusc collection at Cambridge University Museum of Zoology was collected by MacAndrew who donated it to Cambridge University along with his library in 1873. The MacAndrew Collection contains tens of thousands of specimens, the bulk of which were collected by MacAndrew on his many dredging expeditions. The museum mollusc collection is available as an online searchable database through the museum website.

The film stars Dulquer Salmaan, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Sunny Wayne and Surja Bala Hijam. The movie was inspired from the book Long Way Down . The movie was a hit at the Kerala box office and has since developed a cult following among the youth of Kerala. The film began shooting in the north- eastern state of Nagaland in February 2013 and completed its shoot in June 2013. The film was shot at real locations in eight Indian states, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,Tamil Nadu (Tirunelveli Highway) Orissa, West Bengal, Nagaland and Sikkim. The film revolves around Kasi (Dulquer Salmaan) and Suni (Sunny Wayne) who go on a road trip from Kerala to Nagaland. Plot In Kerala, Kasi (Dulquer Salmaan) embarks upon a road trip. His best friend, Suni (Sunny Wayne), joins him and refuses to return even though Kasi informs him that he himself is not sure of the destination. They travel to Orissa via Bangalore and Vizag where they are attacked by bandits. However, a group of riders rescue them and Kasi and Suni join them on their journey to Puri to attend a surfing festival. While in Puri, Kasi meets Ishita (Paloma Monappa), a surfer. She develops an attraction towards Kasi and shares her feelings. Kasi tells her that he was in love with Assi (Surja Bala Hijam), a girl from Nagaland. Nagaland is a place of political unrest and her parents were killed during the fights. Kasi takes her home to get his parents' approval to get married. However, his mom tells him of her displeasure as she does not share their culture or religion. Though his father was more supportive, he too disapproves their relationship fearing the family's social status. It is revealed that Kasi is on his way to Nagaland to win her back. From Puri, they head to Kolkata. However, on the way, they are mistaken for bandits in a village. When they inform him that they are from Kerala, the village chief reminisces about his life as a Communist and welcomes them to stay. In the village, they help to build a machine that grinds wheat. Suni falls in love with the chief's daughter, Gouri (Ena Saha). Beyond Kolkata, they ride further east when an unidentified truck tries to injure Suni. When their bikes get punctured, they take it to a shop which happened to be owned by a Malayalee. He reveals that he had run away from the state years ago for committing a political murder. He informs that years later he has forgotten the ideals of the party and that he yearns to go back. Kasi remembers the time in college when one of his friends was murdered by some goons due to some scuffle. When they reach Assam, they end up in the middle of a communal riot where they rescue a little girl. Kasi begins to regret the road trip and calls his parents to inform them that he is coming back. With a new outlook on life after meeting different people and visiting different places, he decides against going back and continues the journey. As they near their destination, Suni turns back to go to Gouri and the two friends separate. Kasi reaches Nagaland and searches for Assi. The presence of a stranger attracts the attention of local militants and they plan to attack Assi that night. Kasi meets Assi and they get back together. At night when the militants arrive at Assi's house, they find the two missing. The film ends with Kasi and Assi riding away at dawn to Tawang.

The Noda government chose to nationalize the islands just one week after the anniversary of the 1931 Mukden Incident, which served as a pretext for the Imperial Japanese Army to invade northeastern China, which became a step leading up to the Pacific War. It was Imperial Japan's efforts to invade and colonize other Asian countries that eventually led to the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the U.S. in the years leading up to the Pacific War. In the decades leading up to the war, the United States and many private American citizens fervently defended China as a victim of aggression perpetrated by the Empire of Japan. In light of this background, the Noda government's choice to nationalize the islands so close to the anniversary could be interpreted as an attempt to create a direct link between present-day Japan and the Japanese Empire. Since any needlessly provocative actions by the Japanese government could draw the United States into a war with another nuclear power, Noda's action could be seen as needlessly threatening U.S. security, given the fact that the United States has pledged to defend Japan against attack under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. Prior to Noda's move, the Japanese government consulted with the United States. However, according to former U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell (Kyodo News/Japan Times, April 10, 2013), the United States warned Noda not to nationalize the islands. It was in this context that Japanese ambassador to China Uichiro Niwa also warned the Noda government that the nationalization would gravely harm Sino-Japanese relations and potentially endanger peace in North Asia. On June 12, 2012, for example, Ambassador Niwa told the Financial Times \\"If [Tokyo Governor Shintaro] Ishihara‚Äôs plans [to buy the islands] are acted upon, then it will result in an extremely grave crisis in relations between Japan and China. We cannot allow decades of past effort to be brought to nothing.\\" He was then severely criticized by Ishihara, who called for Niwa to be fired. Foreign Minister Koichiro Genba subsequently announced that Niwa had apologized to him in a private letter. Genba shortly thereafter recalled Niwa as Japan's Ambassador to China. Ishihara's actions and Prime Minister Noda's subsequent nationalization of the islands led to large scale anti-Japan demonstrations in 2012 and a grave crisis in diplomatic relations between Japan and China, proving that the fears of the United States and Niwa had been well founded. In an interview of with the Asahi Shimbun published on December 28, 2012, Niwa nevertheless stressed his view that the Senkaku Islands are part of Japanese territory, saying that, \\"The Senkaku Islands are Japanese territory. We should not concede even an inch.\\" But in the same interview the ambassador stated that, \\"Having worked for a company, my thinking was to work on behalf of the nation, society and people. Pursuing only the interests of one's own company will, in the long run, not lead to the development of society. Profits and a company's brand can only be constructed by thinking from a wider perspective.\\" He also stated that \\"When a governor speaks or acts in a manner that can affect national interests, the prime minister should say, 'You should keep quiet. That is a task for the central government.' What would happen to Japan's governing structure if other prefectural governors took a similar action as the Tokyo governor?\\" References External links * Uichiro Niwa blog (Nihon Keizai Shimbun) Category:Ambassadors of Japan to China Category:Living people Category:Nagoya University alumni Category:Itochu people Category:1939 births ","title":"Uichiro Niwa"},{"id":"38354227","text":"Denzel-Ray N.

Famagusta fell to the Ottomans in August 1571 after a siege that lasted nearly a year.Madden. Page 329. Background The large and wealthy island of Cyprus had been under Venetian rule since 1489. Together with Crete, it was one of the major overseas possessions of the Republic. Its population in the mid-16th century is estimated at 160,000.McEvedy & Jones (1978), p. 119 Aside from its location, which allowed the control of the Levantine trade, the island possessed a profitable production of cotton and sugar.Faroqhi (2004), p. 140 The defences of Cyprus, Crete, Corfu, and other Venetian possessions were upgraded in the 1560s, employing the services of the noted military engineer Sforza Pallavicini. Their garrisons were increased, and attempts were made to make the isolated holdings of Crete and Cyprus more self-sufficient by the construction of foundries and gunpowder mills.Setton (1984), pp. 907‚Äì908 However, it was widely recognized that, unaided, Cyprus could not hold for long. Its exposed and isolated location so far from Venice, surrounded by Ottoman territory, put it \\"in the wolf's mouth\\" as one contemporary historian wrote.Setton (1984), p. 908 In the event, lack of supplies and even gunpowder would play a critical role in the fall of the Venetian forts to the Ottomans. Venice could also not rely on help from the major Christian power of the Mediterranean, Habsburg Spain, which was embroiled in the suppression of the Dutch Revolt and domestically against the Moriscos.Abulafia (2012), p. 447 Another problem for Venice was the attitude of the island's population. The harsh treatment and oppressive taxation of the local Orthodox Greek population by the Catholic Venetians had caused great resentment, so that their sympathies generally lay with the Ottomans.Goffman (2002), pp. 155‚Äì156 The Turks decided to conquer Cyprus and on 27 June 1570 the invasion force, some 350‚Äì400 ships and 80,000‚Äì150,000 men, set sail for Cyprus. They besieged and destroyed the capital Nicosia and other Venetian fortifications. The incomplete Venetian walls of Nicosia were of no use in stopping the powerful Ottoman Army, and as many as 20,000 members of the garrison and citizens of the city were massacred; 2,000 boys were spared to be sent as sexual slaves to Constantinople. Depiction of the siege by Giovanni Camocio, 1574 On 15 September 1570 the Turkish cavalry appeared before the last Venetian stronghold in Cyprus, Famagusta. At this point already, overall Venetian losses (including the local population) were estimated by contemporaries at 56,000 killed or taken prisoner.Setton (1984), p. 990 The Venetian defenders of Famagusta numbered about 8,500 men with 90 artillery pieces and were commanded by Marco Antonio Bragadin. They would hold out for 11 months against a force that would come to number more than 200,000 men, with 145 guns,Turnbull (2003), pp. 58‚Äì59 providing the time needed by the Pope to cobble together an anti-Ottoman league from the reluctant Christian European states.Hopkins (2007), pp. 87‚Äì89 The siege Marcantonio Bragadin led the defence of Famagusta with Lorenzo Tiepolo, Captain of Paphos, and general Astorre Baglioni (the last \\"Governor\\" of Venetian Cyprus).Bragadin death as a Christian martyr (in Italian) The Ottoman forces kept pressure on for eleven months, while their artillery relentlessly pounded the city's bulwarks. According to Venetian chroniclers, about 6,000 garrison troops stood against some 250,000 Turks with 1,500 cannons, backed by about 150 ships enforcing a naval blockade to stave off any reinforcements. These numbers are, however, likely exaggerated. The besieged garrison of Famagusta put up a heroic struggle lasting well beyond the most optimistic assumptions, against far superior enemy numbers and without any hope of help from the motherland.Alvise Zorzi, \\"La Repubblica del Leone\\" p. 348 Furthermore the Turks were employing new tactics. The entire belt of walls surrounding the town and the exterior plain was filled with earth up to the top of the fortifications. In the meantime a number of tunnels were dug towards and under the city walls to undermine and breach them. In July, 1571 the Turks eventually breached the fortifications and their forces broke into the citadel, being repulsed only at the cost of heavy losses. With provisions and ammunition running out, and no sign of relief from Venice on August 1,Madden. Page 330. Bragadin asked for terms of surrender. Veneitan chronicals claim the Turks lost some 52,000 men in five major assaults,Goffman (2002), p. 158 including the first son of the Turk commander, Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha. The Venetian garrison lost nearly 8,000 soldiers and was reduced to just nine hundred soldiers, many of them wounded and starving (like the local civilians who in the last month were continuously begging Bragadin to surrender). Death of Bragadin and legacy Famagusta's last defenders made terms with the Ottomans before the city was taken by force, since the traditional laws of war allowed for negotiation before the city's defenses were successfully breached, whereas after a city fell by storm all lives and property in the city would be forfeit. 1570-1576 Titian's Flaying of Marsyas. Some researchers such as Helen Lessore speculate that Bragadin's flaying provided the inspiration for this painting. The Ottoman commander generously agreed that, in return for the city's surrender, all Westerners in the city could exit under their own flag and be guaranteed safe passage to Crete; Greeks could leave immediately, or wait two years to decide whether to remain in Famagusta under Ottoman rule, or depart the city for any destination of their choice. For the next three days, evacuation proceeded smoothly. Then, at the surrender ceremony on August 5Madden. Pages 330-331. where Bragadin offered the vacated city to Mustafa, the Ottoman general, after initially receiving him with every courtesy, began behaving erratically, accusing him of murdering Turkish prisoners and hiding munitions. Bragadin denied it, and probably told Mustafa that he was trying to find an excuse to get revenge because a few hundred Venetian soldiers were able to resist for many months his 250,000 Ottoman soldiers. Suddenly, Mustafa pulled a knife and cut off Bragadin's right ear, then ordered his guards to cut off the other ear and his nose. Mustafa even ordered the killing of governor Astorre Baglioni, who was complaining that the Ottomans were not respecting the surrender agreement.Governor Baglioni biography (in Italian) Mustafa then learnt that Bragadin had earlier broken a promise of safe passage to a small convoy of Muslim pilgrims by murdering them despite promising their safety.Kinross, Lord (2002). Ottoman Centuries. Harper Perennial. . There followed a massacre of all Christians still in the city, with Bragadin himself abused. After being left in prison for two weeks, his earlier wounds festering, he was \\"dragged round the walls with sacks of earth and stone on his back; next, tied to a chair, he was hoisted to the yardarm of the Turkish flagship and exposed to the taunts of the sailors. Finally he was taken to the place of execution in the main square, tied naked to a column, and flayed alive while Bragadin was praying the Miserere and invoking Jesus.Norwich. Page 479 Bragadin's quartered body was then distributed as a war trophy among the army, and his skin was stuffed with straw and sewn, reinvested with his military insignia, and exhibited riding an ox in a mocking procession along the streets of Famagusta. The macabre trophy, together with the severed heads of general Alvise Martinengo, Gianantonio Querini, and castellan Andrea Bragadin, was hoisted upon the masthead pennant of the personal galley of the Ottoman commander, Amir al-bahr Mustafa Pasha, to be brought to Constantinople as a gift for Sultan Selim II. Bragadin's fame rests upon the resistance that he made against the vastly superior besieging forces. From a military point of view, the besieged garrison's perseverance required a massive effort by the Ottoman Turks, who were so heavily committed that they were unable to redeploy in time when the Holy League built up the fleet which was later victorious against the Muslim power at Lepanto: this was the legacy of Bragadin and his Venetians to Christianity, as Theodore Mommsen wrote. Historians to this day debate just why Venice did not send help to Bragadin from Souda, Crete. It is alleged that some Venetians thought about putting their limited military assets to better use in the forthcoming clash, already in sight, which would climax in the Battle of Lepanto. When news of Bragadin's death reached Venice, he was regarded as a \\"martyr\\" and his story galvanized Venetian soldiers in the fleet of the Holy League. The Venetian seamen went on to fight with greater zeal than any of the other combatants at the decisive Battle of Lepanto where an Ottoman fleet was crushed by the combined force of much of southern Europe. Nevertheless, the Ottomans did not lose territory, won many naval victories following Lepanto, and exapnded their influence in the Mediterranean Sea for centuries to come.

Born in Montevideo, Uruguay, he studied law at the Universidad de la Republica and came to New York in 1973 where he still resides. During his career he has drawn multiple cartoon characters, produced several films, and made multiple television series and documentaries both in Uruguay and the United States.  Films in Uruguay In his early years Darino had no access to a camera, so, inspired by Norman McLaren, his first experiments with animation included scratching and painting on the film stock itself. =Animation= He participated actively in the Cine Club del Uruguay and taught himself how to make film. His earliest work, Creacion (1963), is the first animation to be created over stock film and hand painted in Uruguay. It was screened at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France, receiving a Certificate. Darino's next films, El Idolo, Sombras sin Luces and Sombras y Luces (1965), are drawn on film stock, but include magnetic sound, like Cocktail de Rayas, which was re-created in digital form in 2011. This was followed by Correcaminos aka Caminante, the first basic animation and computer art on the continent. It was cited by Clemente Padin \\"as the forerunner of Latin American code and web animation\\" in Ovum and other publications. During this time he illustrated book covers for Arca and designed cartoons for Diario Uruguay. =Fiction= Inspired by the acquisition of a Keystone 16mm camera, he shot El Suicida, a fifteen-minute film, with Felipe Lacroze; and Tan Solo Hombres, a thirty-minute film, with Mario Branda, assisted by Alberto Calvelo, with music by Pedro Zalkind, exploring creative editing to tell the story of a marginalized homeless person. Jose Carlos Alvarez praised this film in his review in La Ma√±ana and it received an Award at the Florence International Film Festival in 1976. Through the years, Darino created animation and ID logos for the programs Telemundo and Telecatapl√∫m. With the latter, he expanded his cartoon skills, drawing the show characters, and exploring cut- out techniques. He received an invitation to a Film Festival in Cordoba, Argentina, and, knowing that Jan Lenica would be the Jury's president, he traveled to meet him. They discussed techniques that Darino later implemented in his own style in Carousel and Hello?. Norman McLaren wrote him an enthusiastic letter and left the door open for him to visit the National Film Board of Canada. When Darino was finally able to make the trip, McLaren was sick and semi-retired. He still has the letter's closing with McLaren's signature pinned up at his desk. In February 1968 he filmed Apex, with Rodolfo Musitelli and actress Adriana Lagomarsino. This was the first short in Cinemascope done in Uruguay using posterization, years before its use Andy Warhol in 1970. Cine Club Fax invited him to develop the first full course in film-making. Darino wanted to work with an industry director and contacted Manuel Antin in Buenos Aires. He suggested Pablo Szir. Szir not only accepted, but brought Jorge Goldemberg, from the Escuela de Cine del Litoral in Santa Fe, along with him. As a final exercise the course produced Delito, focusing on social issues, with Mario Branda and Adela-Gleijer. This short received the Award Premio de la Asociaci√≥n de Cr√≠ticos Cinematogr√°ficos del Uruguay; Premio Festival de Cine Nacional,Cine Club Fax; and the Premio Nacional de Cinematograf√≠a Consejo Departamental de Montevideo, 1964. Darino was to assist Pablo Szir with several of his films, designing titles or animation for El bombero esta triste y llora and Diario de campamento, and doing animation in Argentina and in Uruguay for Szir's Es un arbol y una nube and Una industria para el pueblo. =Documentaries= He filmed and directed the feature documentary Copihues Rojos for the Consejo Nacional de Ensenanza Primaria (Uruguay), a co-production with Chile about teachers' exchange between the two countries, and social issues, and Orate Frates about the miraculous San Cono festivities in Florida, assisted by Eduardo Terra. Horacio Schek from Teledoce asked him to make a pilot for the travel series Pasaporte. Turismo asked for El Lapiz Magico, and Daniel Scheck, from El Pais, had him make Campeon de Campeones about the Uruguayan world soccer championships which closed out Darino's work in the 1980s. Mundialito, He made the animated film El Gallito Luis, combining cartooning with live actors, \\"way before Roger Rabbit\\", as Peter Cowie says in the International Film Guide. At the ICUR, the only department of the University making films at the time, Darino filmed multiple science shorts: \\"Ancistrus\\", \\"Termites\\", \\"Spiders\\", and \\"Hoplias Malabaricus\\", continued doing cartoons and worked with Walter Dassory and Roberto Gardiol. Dr. Rodolfo Talice, ICUR's Director, entrusted him with Pontoporia ‚Äì El delfin del Plata, a film about the language of dolphins, filmed in Punta del Diablo, Rocha, Uruguay. This was made with the participation of Japanese scientists and Ren√© Guy Busnel, a partner of Jacques Cousteau, who later published Psycho-acoustic Studies of Dolphins, and many other studies. Films in the United States =Animation= As a Fulbright fellow, studying at New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts, Darino was shocked to learn that the Oxberry animation stand, mentioned in the course catalog, was Francis Lee's and that the school would use it only a few hours a semester. He ended up assisting Lee, to get access to the stand, and animated Carioca for him for TV Globo. He was required to get a basic stand for his NYU thesis, Homomania, sound by Miguel Castro, which he started at ICUR, Uruguay. Eli Hamerow, his editing teacher, introduced the class to the Optical House, where he met Richard \\"Dick\\" Rauh. At this time, Harry Marks was working for ABC and conceived of the idea of the moving logo. Eduardo hung around the 45th Street studios, trying to get a first look at the new technology, and was captivated by the possibilities of 'motion graphics', a subject he still teaches at Pratt Institute. Dick Rauh invited him to join ASIFA EAST, where he met John Gatti and Tissa David. Both needed help, but Gattis' stop motion style using huge models, was not his cup of tea. He tried key frame animation for \\"Raggedy Ann & Andy\\", but also quit this because it was not his style. Tissa recommended him for a Charlie Brown special, where he had fun drawing SNOOPY. Although he loved to draw, he could not sit around all day, and he took assignments from two former classmates, Skip Winitsky at Urban Academy and Paul Kimball at ISO. Laurie Anderson asked him to shoot her early animations, and through Bernhard he edited a television spot with the voice of Orson Welles, who called him \\"a surrealist\\". He needed more space, and to lend him money to buy a loft the banks were asking for proof he had \\"a real job\\". He was hired as Creative Director at World Publishing Co., then by Idea Publishing Co. to run their multimedia department. Working long hours, he illustrated many of their publications with his cartoons, signing them \\"Sylsu\\", a compound from the name of his wife Sylvia Susana. Once the required six months had passed, he left the publishing industry, setting up his own studio, Darino Films, on Park Avenue South. After he graduated, NYU asked him to teach some animation workshops. His child Lucia was born, and Darino concentrated on animation for children, with The Bird, The Fox and the Full Moon (Texture Films) and many others. He was encouraged to produce material by his distributor Bernice Coe, since HBO and BRAVO were buying shorts as there were no commercials at that point. Bill Sloan screened his films at Donnell Film Library, and Homomania was shown at MOMA as part of an NYU selection of work by award-winning alumni. DC Comics sponsored an American Lung Association PR campaign with a \\"Superman kit\\", and Darino was chosen to design and animate the cartoon superhero. This exposure landed him assignments to animate \\"Rainbow Unicorn\\" for Scott Co, followed by \\"Sketches of Agemo\\" and \\"Baron Sunday\\". The producers wanted the animation done in Asia, but Darino insisted it could be done in New York, implementing sensible budget-cutting ideas. When the ink and paint jobs were sent overseas he quit. During a slow time in the industry, he got a one- project Art Director's job at Roger Wade Productions, where Jim Logan had produced animation. The studio had changed and was not using the Oxberry stand which was collecting dust. Ed made an offer, bought the Master Series animation stand, and ordered the first \\"Cameraman\\" computer system from Bill Ferster. But the gears did not register multiple passes properly, so he sold it. Darino began to experiment with office duplicators and made Hello? for AT&T; for the centennial anniversary of the first telephone conversation. He also produced Carousel, Tango and Kaleidoscope, the first animations using copiers with the CopyMotion¬Æ system, developed by Darino, which he registered in August 1997. The CopyMotion process had an experimental, abstract flavor. Feeling he needed a realistic look, and in order to control the Oxberry precisely, he bought a Cinetron computer, the top of the line in the industry but also very, very expensive. There were no tutorials then; learning was all by trial and error. Learning the software and generating camera effects, he created a few re-usable backgrounds, and offered camera service. Sal Mallimo, from Mimondo Productions, used the service sporadically for his Saturday Night Live, The Venture Bros titles, and trailers. One day Mallimo had a cold and sent his Art Director, who learned about Ed's expertise, liked his work, and asked him to create a star field for a teaser of Star Trek. Barry Rappaport, interviewed by ADA, remembers: \\"Ed was doing the star fields for our teaser, and he came up with a trick by sandwiching the high contrast kodaliths on an opal glass under the camera, and ‚Ä¶a \\"glow\\" came out!!\\" Today the glow is part of film grammar and special effects tools. Using the Cinetron, he started \\"painting with light\\", creating a name for the studio by his impressive streaks and slit scans. This was not yet computer graphics, but a photographic effect where the camera tracked while moving toward or away from a slit, behind which a back-lit artwork passed, exposing one frame at a time. Autodesk software evolved into the 3D world, and Mark Gerhard, in Petaluma, and Brent Blacken, in San Francisco, showed him the ropes on Animator and 3d max. Doing interviews for SCIENCE 2000, he was suggested as a reviewer for Typestry. During lunch, they learned about Ed's drawing work and invited him to join a fledgling Pixar studio that had released Luxo Jr and was planning its first feature, Toy Story in 1995. Ed declined Pixar‚Äôs offer, preferring to stay in New York. He signed two series for children, Man the Maker, about inventions, and Forgotten Legends. He tried producing storyboards and pre-production in Uruguay. In the 1980s he attempted to produce animation and films for export from Uruguay, but the political situation made him change his plans. Thirty years later, when he met Nicol√°s Pe√±a from MoPix and Juan Jose Lopez from Aparato TV they had turned that dream into a reality. Darino Films also animated for The Legend of the Amazon River, narrated by Eli Wallach, The Great Cover Up from Texture Films, Ugly Duckling and Beauty and the Beast with Fred Ladd, and opening animation for Calliope for USA Networks. Maureen Gaffney from the Media Center for Children enthusiastically proposed to include his work in their series. \\"Your work is wonderful, children like it, and I think our new series would ensure it a place in the brave new world of home video\\". Darino designed and animated over 300 ID logos for corporations and networks, including: IBM, Con Edison, New York Public Library, Phillip Morris, Daily News, Manhattan Cable, AT&T;, etc., as well as television stations and international networks. The studio became well known abroad. Notre Monde in Paris had it produce the introduction to the series \\"L‚Äôenvie de savoir et de comprendre\\", and its client list expanded with: Kalender, GuestMusic and SAV from Spain, Avo films and RAI from Italy, Turkish TRT, China Public TV, etc. Kailash Studios from Bombay, India landed in New York, and Ed animated a Hindu version of the Little King, Nirma and Vimal. Maazda had a presence in New York and requested cartoons for Rasna, and Mega Pictures commissioned tests for Raju and Chacha, although these plans fell through due to legislation in India protecting local production. At that time Darino was combining the pencil with the digital tablet. Jeff Schillen from DEC Diamond Entertainment published in video the complete Space Exploration. =Documentaries= With Marketa Kimbrell's New York Street Theater Caravan, Darino improvised Process over a poem by Pablo Neruda about the Latin American struggle, which was well received at Festival dei Poppoli, in Florence, as well as in Houston and Chicago. He directed The Strangers for the US Bicentennial, Poison on the Walls for the NY City Health Department, and Antonio Frasconi: Against the Grain, which won an award at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and Los Desaparecidos, which included woodcuts by Antonio Frasconi. During Paez Vilaro's period in New York, Darino did Candombe, with Vilaro's paintings and drawings, and text by Jorge Luis Borges. Humberto Goyen, General Consul from Uruguay, gathered artists in New York at the time. Alfredo Zitarrosa, Serebrier, Julio Alpui, Julian Murguia, and Darino, discussed a return to democracy in Uruguay and proposed action to show active support for Dr. Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti. Goyen interested Robert Allen, who backed a package of three titles suggested by Coe Films for HBO, and Darino prepared the docudrama Guri, the Young Gaucho, starring Eli Wallach. from a story by Serafin J. Garcia. In order to use Wallach's services, Darino joined the SAG (Screen Actors Guild), and since then he has read many of the Spanish versions of his documentaries. Guri was shot in Uruguay. When Darino arrived on location, the expected return to democracy was delayed. He canceled the other two titles, and abandoned his plans to produce in his homeland. =Television specials= From then on Darino turned to producing science and nature-ecology series for television. He rejected proposals to create conventional shows, wishing to remain independent and, with his limited crew and budget, produced: Save the Earth ‚Äì Salvar la Tierra (the first time ozone was mentioned as a possible problem), World Disasters, Femmes Fatales, The Best of Slapstick, The World of 3D Studio, and Save Our Planet (2). He was the editor of over 300 episodes and French versions, for the weekly show Hollywood Stars. Also for producer Sam Simerman he did special effects and animation for Biography with Denzel Washington, Tom Hanks, and Hollywood: The Magic Night, about the Oscar Awards. As editor for SCTV-Entertainment News he did over 150 TV episodes of Hollywood Talks, combining interviews and motion picture EPK footage (material provided for the press reviews). Madeleine Lopez Silvero asked him to do a fashion show for Galavision, and he accepted as long as he could include his effects. Darino combined graphics, split the screen. and included negative-positive footage. Executive producer Rogelio Sandoval said: [Darino] renovates the \\"runway\\" into a broadcasting top show, changing the way we see fashion with La Moda al Dia/Fashion Next, hosted by Janene Sumampow. Pushing the envelope at all times, and looking for original interviews and exclusive images, in Paris Darino met Michele Lagarde, press attach√© for Mondial Coiffure and Mondial Beaute, who allowed him to use multiple cameras and unlimited interactive lights, and, in another first, integrating multiple projections, for several high end specials. Thomas J. Ashley from Millennium Productions signed him for animation and editing on his popular minute series, This Day in Hollywood, This Day in New York and This Day in History. =Television series= The years for Satcom Digital Libraries show Darino working as Producer-Director, and in many episodes also Editor-Animator, of multiple television series and documentaries (serving as On camera host - SAG category - for several educational versions): * Nature in Danger \\\\- nature. * Save The Earth \\\\- ecology/nature. * Science 2000 \\\\- science-technology. * English for Business & English for Executives.Kalender video-8-414915-002042 / 1990 deposito M814-90 * Our Body Our Health. * Mysteries beyond Our Galaxy ‚Äì space. * Secrets of Our Planets ‚Äì space. * Discovering Our Universe ‚Äì space. * Secrets from Our Galaxy ‚Äì space. * Miracles of Science and Technology \\\\- science-technology. * Next-tech \\\\- science-technology. * The World of 3. \\\\- computer graphics. * Byte The Pixel \\\\- internet. * Cyberworld \\\\- web- internet. * Surfing the Web \\\\- internet. * Mastering the Internet \\\\- internet. * Discover Secrets of Science for Sandra Carter - Disney's Discover. = Library of Special Visual Effects = Using advertisements in Millimeter and Variety Magazines, Darino reached out to foreign producers arrived in New York looking for something new. Responding to the needs of these clients, Darino created a small archive of ready made scenes, such as a star field, the earth spinning, or an explosion, which he later expanded into \\"The Library of Special Visual Effects\\", a collection of eleven hours of ready-to-use animation, openings and bumpers, licensed in more than 68 countries.AVO FILMS. 010927-033946 \\"La raccolata degli effete speciali video\\" (cod.3394) Ed Darino ‚Äì 1991 =Experimental, contemporary digital animation= Camba Cate writes on Proyecto Cruz del Sur that Darino is one of the few artists who keeps up-to- date with technological changes on a daily basis, mastering film, then video and now computers. Cate cites Javier Kostura's interview on Midem News when Darino forecast: \\"the VHS is dead, it's the end of tape and DVD may not have a long life. In future years we will see a television station on each Mac and PC.\\" He keeps exploring options: the tapeless camera, streaming video, and new ways of doing animation first with Time Arts' Lumena buffers, then with Adobe LiveMotion (precursor of Flash), and recently with particles. He specialized in 'Digital Compositing' in the series Make Believe and 'Motion Graphics' in the series Is it Type or Image? and 'Electronic Type Crumbs', which he still teaches at Digital Arts, Pratt Institute. He experimented with interactive presentations, the most original being the series Irreverent Realities, and with intrusive flashes in public spaces, such as Times Square, Union Square Park, Washington Square, celebrating the anniversaries of artists' deaths, including Pedro Figari, Alfredo Zitarrosa, Juan Carlos Onetti and others. \\"Digital imagine consists of 0 and 1, ON and OFF\\", Darino explains, \\"so why not animate at the pixel level?\\", sort of splitting the atom of CGI, which he does. Since rendering particles is a slow process, he joined forces with programmers to develop a system of real time particles, creating multiple shorts combined by subject: Digital Brush-Pincel Digital, Punta del Este (2010‚Äì2013).

Under the command of Brigadier Julian St. Clair Holbrook, 6th AGRA was created at the Royal Artillery Base Depot near Almaza, North Africa on 15 March 1943. As with all newly formed units, the Headquarters was established initially and the administrative centre set up. The men in charge chose the 6th sign of the Zodiac as their formation badge - this was worn on the right sleeve of the Battledress uniform, with the 8th Army badge on the left sleeve. The HQ 6th AGRA then moved to Beni Yusef, near Cairo in April 1943 to begin the task of establishing the numerous regiments that would form its order of battle. By the end of that month, the Group consisted of three Medium Regiments, RA as follows: * 66th (Lowland) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 75th (Shropshire Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 80th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery The first action of 6th AGRA was during Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, with the advanced guard of 66th Medium Regiment landing on 10 July 1943 and the guns themselves being deployed and ready to fire by 12th. The AGRA then took part in the Invasion of Italy, firing across the straight of Messina onto Italian soil. For this operation, both 5th and 6th AGRA fired side by side. Through the Italian Campaign, 6th AGRA fought at Sangro, Cassino, Arezzo, Florence, the assault on the Gothic Line. They held station on Monte Grande beside the British 1st Infantry Division over the winter of 1944/45, before beginning the Spring Offensive in the Po Valley. 6th AGRA finished the war in Austria, Brigadier Holbrook having left the formation 3 weeks prior to the final surrender of Axis Forces in Europe. The AGRA was the commanded by Brigadier T. F. K. Howard, DSO, who following the war, gave this assessment of the AGRA and of his late command of the units in it: \\"It was like giving the final tap to a truly driven nail with a nicely balanced hammer. It was so nicely balanced too.\\" 6th AGRA was disbanded in November 1945.  Order of battle  During the various stages of its time in action, 6th AGRA's order of battle varied widely as regiments were seconded to it and other regiments were assigned elsewhere. The following is a list of all the units engaged within 6th AGRA at some time during its operational establishment, during the war: * Headquarters 6th Army Group Royal Artillery * 66th (Lowland) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 75th (Shropshire Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 76th (Shropshire Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 78th (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 75th (Highland) Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery * Counter Battery Staff XIII Corps * 80th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 2nd Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 69th (Caernarvon & Denbigh Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 61st Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery * 5th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery * 194th (U.S) F.A. Group * 3rd Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery * 376th (Artillery) Company, Royal Army Service Corps * 655th Air O.P. Squadron, Royal Air Force * 126th Meteorological Section, Royal Air Force * 21st Canadian Meteorological Section, Royal Canadian Artillery * 40th Squadron, South African Air Force * 51st (London) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery was temporarily assigned to 6th AGRA for the crossing of the Sangro and Biferno rivers at the end of November 1943. Its 3.7-inch AA guns supplemented the medium artillery in the long preparatory bombardment, and then switched to anti-aircraft protection of the assembly and bridgehead areas for the actual assault.Routledge, p. 282. Post-war Brigadier Hollbrook later went on to command 86th AGRA (TA), a post-war Territorial Army Group Royal Artillery, which had command ties to the 6th AGRA, through Holbrook. The post-war 86th AGRA (TA) had a very similar sign to the 6th AGRA, but with the tail of the 'M' separated. Notes References * G. Meddemmen, The Guns of 6th AGRA, HMSO. Date Unknown. * Brig N.W.

They were assimilationists, meaning that they wanted Algerian society to integrate with French colonial society. As such, they called for reforms that would give France's Algerian subjects the same rights as French citizens enjoyed. History The Young Algerians emerged from a new group of middle class Algerians who were integrated into the French economic system and had gone through the French education system. They were influenced by the Young Tunisians movement, and established a number of study circles. In 1908 they went to France to meet Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and set out their demands. They sent another delegation to France in 1912 to present the \\"Young Algerians Manifesto\\", which demanded reforms including equal taxation, representation in the French National Assembly, wider suffrage and the abolition of the Code de l'Indig√©nat.Frank Tachau (1994) Political parties of the Middle East and North Africa, Greenwood Press, p. 2 They were also able to publish a number of journals including L'Islam and El-Hack.John Ruedy (2005) Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation, Bloomington, pp. 106‚Äì108 Although the group was, for a time, at the forefront of the Algerian resistance to French colonial policy, it never gained much support either from the Algerians, who saw them as aloof and overly French, or from the colons (European immigrants), who feared and suspected them. This meant that they usually performed badly in elections. In an attempt to overcome this, the Young Algerians gained the support of the popular Khaled ibn Hashimi ibn Hajj Abd al Qadir, the grandson of Abd al Qadir, the resistance fighter of the 1830s.Ruedy, pp. 109‚Äì110. The Young Algerians successfully used France's need to conscript its Algerian subjects for World War I to extract a number of minor reforms from France in the immediate pre-war years. In 1917, when Clemenceau returned to power in France, a more serious attempt at reform was made but due to colon opposition, this was watered down and became the Jonnart Law passed in 1919. This reform was divisive, splitting the movement between Khaled, who demanded much more far reaching reform, and more moderate elements such as Benthai, who were largely content with the reforms as a step in the right direction.Ruedy, pp. 110‚Äì113.

Usually this was conferred to male heads of households who developed the property into a farm. If he was a citizen or was taking steps to become one and he and his family developed the land (buildings, fields, fences) he had the right to then buy that land for the minimum price. Land was otherwise sold through auction, typically at a price too high for these settlers. Preemption is similar to squatter's rights and mining claims. Preemption was politically controversial, primarily among land speculators and their allies in government. In the early history of the United States, and even to some degree during the colonial era, settlers were moving into the \\"virgin wilderness\\" and building homes and farms without regard to land title. The improvements increased the value of all the nearby property. Eventually the political opposition by the speculators crumbled and the Preemption Act of 1841 was passed. The Preemption Act of 1841 was abused by speculators who now operated as money lending businesses, or were able to coerce accomplices to falsely claim they were living on land that they wanted. A common example of the latter practice was in the logging industry in the upper Midwest, where mill workers who lived in mill towns made a preemption claim on timber land that would then be harvested by the mill owners. Another avenue of fraud was the Desert Land Act, which did not include the residence requirement, although the preempting claimant still needed to improve the land, primarily by providing a water source. In California, tens of thousands of acres of land were claimed via false preemptors ‚Äì \\"dummy entrymen\\" ‚Äì on behalf of several large land speculating companies. The Preemption Act of 1841 was pivotal, but was neither the beginning nor the end of the issue of preemption. The Land Act of 1804, the Homestead Act, the aforementioned Desert Land Act, and other similar land acts addressed the issue of preemption.

Career  Stephan Noller studied psychology at the University of Cologne, earning honors with distinction for his thesis \\"Mental Models and Web Navigation\\". In professional publications and research studies Noller concentrated on theories as to what conclusions could be drawn from users' online behavior. His roots come from Fraunhofer Society, where he worked on machine learning algorithms to predict user's interests and demographics out of behavioral data. After developing a new process for measuring internet coverage for the industry association AGOF while working at TNS Emnid, he created an online advertising targeting system based on automated profiling for TNS Infratest in 2006: Predictive Behavioral Targeting by nugg.ad. Besides continually developing this system, he was also active for United Internet Media, and published portals such as web.de (named TGP) and gmx.de. The Predictive Behavioral Targeting system became the first targeting system to be granted the data privacy seal of The Independent Centre for Privacy Protection (ULD) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, and was also granted the EuroPriSe seal (funded by the European Commission under its eTEN programme) in 2009 for using a preceding anonymization process that filtered IP addresses reliably, compliant with the central data austerity criterion of data protection. The German government awarded Noller and Richard Hutton a patent for the system in February 2015. In 2009, Noller was elected chairman of the IAB Europe Policy Committee, where he represented the interests of the European internet industry to political committees at the continent level, influenced market developments, and responded to challenges to data privacy caused by data- driven internet business models. On 14 April 2011, the committee headed a broad coalition of associations, companies, and tech providers of the European online industry in presenting a self-regulation model to the public; it addressed the loophole regarding the realization of the ePrivacy directive towards the European Commission and sought to bring more transparency and control to consumers regarding online behavioral advertising. In appreciation of his activities and work, Noller was awarded the \\"Best Personality\\" award at the 2012 Marketing and Interactive Excellence Awards Europe. Since 2012 he is a columnist for the leading data driven-advertising blog ExchangeWire. In 2013 he was appointed to the Advisory Board to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, the \\"Junge Digitale Wirtschaft\\", and to the Rheinland Palatine's state council for digital development and culture. Besides the industrial aspects of data and data privacy, Stephan Noller takes part in the so-called post-privacy debate, and has commented regarding to what extent the classical data privacy model is applicable to today's internet usage scenarios.

Osman Bejtullah ag√´ Kuka also known as Oso Kuka (c. 1812/1820‚Äì1862) was a border guard in the Ottoman-Montenegrin border. Surrounded by Montenegrin soldiers in a tower on the island of Vranjina, he blew it up killing himself and many of the Montenegrin soldiers. In the following decades, he became a rallying figure of the Albanian independence movement and a much-celebrated character of important works in Albanian literature.  Background  2 decades earlier, several battles had been fought over the possession of the island, primarily between Ottoman forces, joined by Albanians, and Montenegrins. Between 1835-1844, various rebellions among Albanian highlanders against the Porte led to the enforcement of local Albanian interests. On October 16, 1843, Ottman forces numbering 12,000, led by the Governor of Shkod√´r, seized the island. The Ottomans arrived on the lake with 50-60 canons and opened fire with on the Montenegrin troops in the tower. The Ottomans blew up the tower killing 7 and wounded 18 who were captured. The Ottomans also sezied the tower Lesendra, with 10-12 000 troops, and the Montenegrins, numbering 200, fled and were met with harsh criticism by their countrymen. The Montenegrins tried under Petar II Petrovic Njegos to reclaim the island several times but failed.GLAVA III Mitropolija crnogorska za vrijeme mitropolita Petroviƒáa.

In 1843, three islands on Lake Skadar were lost: Vranjina, Grmo≈æur and Lesendro. Njegos tried to retrieve them several times, but failed. Even today, the saying in Montenegro is that when one complains something, it is said: \\"Burn to Bishop for Lesendrom\\".) In 1844, Albanian highlanders from Shkod√´r sailed with 4 ships to the island of Vranjina to built barracks in order to resist Montenegrin forces.  Life  Born around 1812 or 1820 in Shkod√´r, in a timariot family with early origins from the area of Kuk√´s. His family also held several other positions in the Sanjak of Scutari, his grandfather and other relatives were keth√ºda of the castle. His father, Bejtullah ag√´ Kuka, was standard-bearer of the Albanian Pasha and Vezir, Mustafa Pasha of Shkodra of the powerful Bushati dynasty. At 1859 due to the proposition of the Albanian Ottoman commander Hodo Sokoli, Oso Kuka was promoted y√ºzba≈üƒ± of the border guards on the Ottoman-Montenegrin border. Vranjina, view from ≈Ωabljak Crnojeviƒáa Oso Kuka himself had formed a 24-man band (√ßet√´) that was active in the city. At the head of a small group, Oso Kuka arrived on the battlefields where 8,000 Montenegrin soldiers had been besieging the fort of Vranjina. Kuka and his groups were defending a secondary tower in front of the main tower. When it was surrounded, instead of surrendering, Kuka planted explosives in the tower, which he activated when the Montenegrins stormed the tower and killed hundreds of Montenegrin soldiers along with his group.. His bravery made possible that Vranina continued to be under Albanian control up to 1879, when the Congress of Berlin ceded it to Montenegro.  Legacy  Oso Kuka over the decades became a major rallying figure of the Albanian national awakening. One of the most important representations of Oso Kuka in literature is that in Gjergj Fishta's epic Lahuta e Malcis. Oso Kuka's involvement in the war and his death comprise the first five cantos also known as the \\"cycle of Oso Kuka\\". Ndre Zadeja also wrote a melodrama titled Oso Kuka, based on his life. His residence in Shkod√´r houses the city's historical museum, while Slavic speaking population of the small village in Vranjina (modern-day Montenegro) show to visitors so-called \\"house of Oso Kuka\\".

The Rhyme was released in the United States exclusively by Verizon Wireless on September 22, 2011, with releases in Asia and Europe beginning in October 2011. The Rhyme is a mid-range smartphone, distinguished by its use of an updated HTC Sense 3.5 user experience, and a selection of bundled accessories; such as a charging dock, wireless speakers, and an LED \\"charm\\" that can be used as a notification light. While it was not explicitly marketed as such by HTC (who referred to it as a \\"lifestyle\\" phone), the Rhyme was primarily developed and targeted towards women. The Rhyme received favorable reviews for its performance, robust physical design, a cleaner user interface in comparison to past HTC phones, along with its accessories. However, the Rhyme's overall specifications were panned by some for being too low-end in comparison to other recently released smartphones, or for being too similar to the HTC Desire S. Development and release In May 2011, the technology blog This Is My Next learned that HTC was holding focus groups with women in their 20s and 30s regarding a new, female-oriented smartphone codenamed \\"Bliss\\", which would be released by Verizon Wireless by the end of the year. Leaked details from the groups indicated that the phone would have a \\"calming\\" sea green color scheme with a design resembling a cross between the Desire S and Desire Z, and be pre-loaded with calorie counting and comparison shopping apps. Details also emerged about accessories that would be bundled with the Bliss, such as a speaker designed to be attached to a car's sun visor, a speaker dock for charging, and an LED \\"charm\\" attachment that could be used to provide notifications. Photos of the device's hardware and software leaked on a Chinese website in August 2011, revealing a new version of HTC Sense with updated widgets and a streamlined home screen layout. On September 19, 2011, the final version of the device, now known as the HTC Rhyme, was leaked by a pre-order advertisement from TargetMobile. A Target PR representative stated that the Rhyme would become available in-store on September 29, 2011. HTC officially unveiled the Rhyme during a press event the following day, and also confirmed that it would be released exclusively by O2 in the United Kingdom on October 17, 2011. Whilst unveiling the phone, HTC did not explicitly target the Rhyme towards women, but instead referred to it as a \\"lifestyle\\" device. Features The Rhyme was constructed in a similar fashion to other recent HTC phones, with an aluminum unibody shell on its front, partially wrapping around its rear. The top portion of its rear above the aluminum \\"strip\\" is made of plastic to allow radio reception, while the lower removable bottom portion (which conceals its MicroSD and SIM card slots) uses a plastic intended to improve grip. The Rhyme was made available in three different colors; \\"Plum\\", \\"Hourglass\\", and \\"Clearwater\\". Only the Plum version was made available in the United States. The Rhyme uses a single-core, 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon with 3G connectivity, 768 MB of RAM, 4 GB of internal storage, a pre-loaded 8 GB microSD card, and a 3.7-inch WVGA LCD touchscreen display. The Rhyme uses a rear-facing 5-megapixel camera with LED flash and 720p video recording, and a front-facing VGA camera; the camera app includes burst mode, face recognition, and the ability to automatically upload photos to a Facebook album. The Rhyme uses a non-removable, 1600 mAh battery, rated as having 7.3 hours of talk time and 17 hours of standby time. The Rhyme comes bundled with several accessories, such as an armband (designed to hold the phone while exercising), a Bluetooth headset and \\"tangle-free\\" earbuds in matching colors, a Bluetooth speaker designed to be clipped to a car's sun visor, and a charging dock with built-in speakers (which can be used to play music and use the phone as an alarm clock). The Rhyme also shipped with a \\"charm\\" accessory; a small, LED-lit cube that can be used to provide notifications for phone calls and text messages. The charm connects to the phone via a wire connected to its headphone jack; its design is intended to allow the charm to hang outside a bag or pocket for visibility. The charm itself also has a clip, which can be used to attach it to a purse's strap. The device ships with Android 2.3.4 as its operating system, using the HTC Sense 3.5 user interface; the new version uses a simplified home screen layout that is exclusive to the Rhyme and the low-end Explorer, offering the ability to have up to five app shortcuts on the side of the home page, which can slide open to display additional content when available (such as upcoming calendar events or recent photos). The curved \\"dock\\" seen on other HTC phones is also replaced with two buttons in the bottom corners of the screen for the app drawer and phone. Alongside the stock HTC Sense apps, the Rhyme is also pre- loaded with the exercise app Endomondo, the Dropbox app, and the HTC Watch movie service. On the U.S. version, the Rhyme also ships with several non- removable Verizon apps, such as V Cast and VZ Navigator. On August 31, 2012, HTC released a downloadable update to Android 4.0 with Sense 3.6 for the Rhyme through its HTCdev portal. Reception Critics panned the Rhyme for being too similar to the HTC Desire S (pictured) The HTC Rhyme received mostly positive reviews. The performance of its 1 GHz single-core processor was considered responsive, but some reviewers encountered occasional lag when launching applications. The updated Sense 3.5 interface was praised for its cleaner home screen layout in comparison to other HTC phones, and its new ability to add and remove pages from the screen‚Äîbut Engadget's Lydia Leavitt still criticized the Rhyme for containing too many miscellaneous HTC apps and widgets alongside Verizon's \\"crapware\\" applications. However, she complimented the carrier for its less intrusive presence on the Rhyme in comparison to past devices. The Rhyme's overall design was complimented by Engadget for being \\"almost as delicious as it sounds\\" and easy to grip. CNET considered the Rhyme's build to be compact and \\"luxurious\\", but felt that its other color options should have been made available in the U.S. as well to broaden its appeal beyond women. The Rhyme's 5-megapixel camera was shown to perform better in daylight environments and produce images and video of a decent quality. The Rhyme's accessories were met with mixed reviews. CNET considered the included dock and accompanying functionality to be a \\"nice extra\\", but that the charm was an accessory that only some people would actually use. For pricing reasons, it was also suggested that a version of the Rhyme without the accessories included should have been offered as well. Engadget considered the charm to be a \\"glorified girly notification LED\\" that was difficult to see in sunlight and hard to attach to purses due to its \\"inflexible\\" clip. Its earbuds were also criticized for their poor fit, and their \\"scratchy and downright embarrassing\\" audio quality. However, TechRadar considered the charm to be useful, primarily because \\"it can often be a little difficult to wrench a phone out of a bag in time to catch the call.\\" CNET gave the HTC Rhyme an 8.0 out of 10 rating, considering it a niche phone for users who want a \\"stylish and functional\\" alternative to Verizon's higher-end devices. Engadget's Lydia Leavitt was critical of the phone's lack of a large screen, dual-core processor, or LTE support, but noted that its single-core processor still made the phone responsive, and that the lack of LTE did contribute to longer battery life than the HTC ThunderBolt. In conclusion, she suggested that people who do not like purple or HTC Sense buy a \\"male\\" phone instead. TechRadar's Laura Tosney gave the Rhyme a 4/5, considering it to be a further example of HTC's ability to make capable mid-range phones, but panned the device for essentially being a variation of the HTC Desire S with added accessories.

Portuguese explorer and trader first reached Indonesian archipelago during the age of exploration in the 16th century in order to search for spices in the Indies. In 1999, Indonesia and Portugal restored diplomatic relations, which were severed following the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. Indonesia has an embassy in Lisbon Indonesian embassy in Lisbon and Portugal has an embassy in Jakarta. History Padr√£o of Sunda Kelapa (1522), National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta. Since gaining foothold in Southeast Asian region by acquiring port of Malacca in 1511, Portuguese sent exploratory expeditions into Indonesian archipelago, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices and to extend their Roman Catholic missionary efforts. Tom√© Pires' Suma Oriental, written between 1512‚Äì1515, provides important information about 16th century Indonesia through Portuguese perspective. Initial Portuguese attempts to establish a coalition and peace treaty in 1522 with the West Javan Sunda Kingdom,; failed due hostilities amongst indigenous kingdoms on Java. The Portuguese turned east to Maluku. Through both military conquest and alliance with local rulers, they established trading posts, forts, and missions in eastern Indonesia including the islands of Ternate, Ambon, and Solor. Following defeat in 1575 at Ternate at the hands of natives, Portuguese lost much of its trading posts and its former East Indies possessions to Dutch, and its presence in Indonesia was reduced to Solor, Flores and Timor (see Portuguese Timor) in modern-day Nusa Tenggara. After the independence of Indonesia, the two countries officially opened diplomatic relations in 1950. Indonesia's first president Sukarno visited Portugal in 1960. The diplomatic relations were severed since 1964, and were restored in May 1975 for decolonization of Portuguese Timor neighboring Indonesian side of Timor Island However, on 7 December 1975 Portugal severed diplomatic ties following the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. Then 24 years later on 28 December 1999 Indonesia and Portugal restored their diplomatic ties, four months after East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. In May 2012 President An√≠bal Cavaco Silva visited Indonesia, this was the first visit by a Portuguese president since the two countries opened diplomatic relations in 1950. Culture Portuguese was among the first European that made initial contact to the natives of Indonesian archipelago. The cultural impact can be seen through the adoptions of Portuguese loanwords in Indonesian, that mostly about things brought by Europeans, such as sabun (from sab√£o = soap), boneka (from boneca = doll), gereja (from igreja = church), bola (from bola = ball), bendera (from bandeira = flag), sepatu (from sapato = shoes), keju (from queijo = cheese), and mentega (from manteiga = butter). Portuguese influences can be found in various parts in Indonesia from Aceh in the West through Flores and Maluku in the East. In Jakarta, in the Tugu area, Portuguese descents are now living preserving the keroncong music which carries much influence from the Portuguese music. In Larantuka, Flores, every year ahead of the Easter Day the city is full with pilgrims who wish to celebrate 'Semana Santa' or the Holy Week. Christians there conduct mass and rituals in Portuguese.

Biography Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n rose through the military ranks during the years following the Mexican Revolution. It was in this context that he met General (and later President) L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Like other military officers of the time, Henr√≠quez joined the military wing of the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI in 1938. Even after the PRI was later reorganized and its military wing was eliminated as one of its basic constituencies, Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n remained a dedicated party member, despite the popularity achieved by his fellow general Juan Andrew Almaz√°n as an opposition candidate in the 1940 presidential election. By 1951, however, Miguel Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n joined with his brother, the noted entrepreneur Jorge Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n, and other high-ranking members of the PRI such as Jos√© Mu√±oz Cota, to create a break-away party of former PRI activists, which they called the Federation of the Mexican People's Parties. Prominent members in this new party included other former generals from the Mexican Revolution such as Genovevo de la O, as well as other political parties such as the Partido Constitucionalista Mexicano (Mexican Constitutionalist Party) led by Francisco J. M√∫jica. The result was a broad alliance of political, pro-agrarian reform, and social organizations that represented a serious challenge to the practice of presidential succession under the period of PRI domination from 1940 to 1988. In particular, in the 1952 general election Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n ran against the candidates of the established parties‚Äîthe PRI (Adolfo Ruiz Cortines), the PAN (Efra√≠n Gonz√°lez Luna), and the Popular Party (Vicente Lombardo Toledano). It was during this campaign season that the model of political advertising aimed at praising the virtues of a party's candidate was adopted. This was the first time in Mexican history when marketing research was used in a political campaign. The Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n campaign used a Mariachi tune composed for him by Manuel Ramos Trujillo to promote his candidacy. Though this use of campaign jingles was condemned by critics who saw it as taking away the seriousness of the business of politics, the success of the song throughout many regions of the country led to the wide adoption of this and other marketing techniques in future campaigns. In the final count, Ruiz Cortines won with more than 74 percent of the popular vote, followed by Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n with 15.9 percent. These results set off a wave of protests in several states, which were violently suppressed by the administration of Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s. Among those calling for justice were the former Mexican ambassador to Honduras, Jos√© Mu√±oz Cota Ib√°√±ez, and Alicia P√©rez Salazar. Despite the intensity of the protests, the results stood. Henr√≠quez Guzm√°n then retired from public life.

Done well, right fights bring out the best of human capacity. By contrast, wrong fights ‚Äì or right fights that never happen ‚Äì can transform high purpose into failure. The first three right fight principles described in Part Two guide readers in recognizing right fights. These principles are: # make the fight material, with big enough stakes to motivate everyone # focus on the future, without apportioning blame for the past # make the fight about a noble purpose ‚Äì such as improving the lives of customers The last three right fight principles, covered in Part Three, are: # * make the fight a sport with rules, rather than a war # Structure right fights through the formal organization, but create informal networks and coalitions to help good ideas triumph in spite of the hierarchy #Turn pain into gain by assuring that everyone, including the losers, benefits from the experience.

It is based on the 1981 horror film The Evil Dead by Sam Raimi.  Plot  For their vacation, Ash, his wife Linda, their friend Scotty, and his wife Shelly travel to an apparently abandoned woodland cabin, where they find a recorder, audio reels, and an old book. Scotty plays one of the reels, which were made by the cabin's owners, Professor Raymond Knowby, and his wife, Henrietta. The reel reveals that the professor and his wife were working on translating the book, a seemingly demonic sex guide known as the Necronomicum Ex-Mortis. While reciting a mantra that he found in the Necronomicum, Knowby seemingly went insane, laughing maniacally as he repeated the words over and over again, awakening an evil force. The group ignores the reel, and while Shelly goes to lie down, Ash, Linda, and Scotty have a threesome in a bedroom. Shelly walks in on the trio and, distraught over Scotty's infidelity, runs out into the forest, where she is violated by possessed trees that turn her into a \\"Deadite\\". Shelly returns to the cabin, knocks Ash out, and stabs Linda with a piece of bark that she pulls out of her vagina, infecting the other woman with the evil. Shelly proceeds to seduce Scotty, have sex with him, and rip his throat and testicles out. When Shelly tries to attack Linda, Ash fends her off with a fireplace poker, and locks her in the cellar, but she escapes, and begins having sex with the now demonic Linda. Aroused by the sight of the two Deadites going at it, Ash tries fingering Shelly, which results in his hand becoming possessed. Ash is forced to cut his hand off with a chainsaw, which he then uses to kill Shelly by forcing her to \\"ride\\" the tool's blade. Linda, who has returned to normal, confronts Ash with a locket identical to the one that he had earlier given her. Inside the locket is a picture of Ash having sex with another woman, which angers Linda to the point of causing her to turn back into a Deadite. Ash and Linda wind up having sex; afterward, Ash beheads Linda with the chainsaw, and takes her body out into the woods to dispose of it. Linda's still-living severed head taunts Ash, annoying him into masturbating onto it out of spite. Ash returns to the cabin, and goes into hysterics when the furniture and fixtures (including a mounted deer head) go haywire. Outside, Linda (who has reattached her head) rises from the grave, along with Deadite versions of two of Ash's ex-girlfriends. Ash tries to kill the Deadites with the chainsaw (which he has replaced his missing hand with) but it will not start, leaving him unable to fight off the demonesses as they force him into an orgy. The reverse gangbang ends with Ash using the now functional chainsaw to dismember the undead women as he quips, \\"Groovy!\\"  Cast  * Joanna Angel as Linda Williams * Tommy Pistol as Ashley J. Williams * Kleio Valentien as Shelly * Danny Wylde as Scotty * Veruca James as Deadite #1 * Dana DeArmond as Deadite #2 * Lloyd Kaufman as Professor Raymond Knowby  Reception  Ain't It Cool News responded positively to the film, noting that it was \\"a humorous homage\\" and that \\"the story bits, what little there are, are pretty entertaining\\" before concluding, \\"Sure, there will be those who will turn their noses up to Evil Head, but in this wide world of horror, surely there is room for the porn horror subgenre; especially in this case when it apes the original so well\\". Peter Warren of AVN gave Evil Head a perfect score of 5, finding it to be \\"every bit the rollicking rollercoaster ride of gleeful grotesquery one could hope for\\" and \\"without question one of the most outstanding productions to ever come out of Burning Angel\\". Roger T. Pipe, who awarded the film an 8/12, stated Evil Head was \\"funny, well shot and sexy as fuck\\" while Don Houston of XCritic categorized it as \\"highly recommended\\" after deeming it \\"remarkably entertaining as a porno horror hybrid fuck flick\\". A grade of 3/5 was given to Evil Head by Inked Angels, which opined, \\"The sex parts are just mediocre. Burning Angel has released a lot hotter and better material than this before\\". A similarly lukewarm response was had by VideoTramp, which praised the cinematography and sex scenes, while criticizing performances, and the film's humor.

Retrieved 18 January 2013 =Construction= A chapel was constructed from the stables, coach house and stable yard of Morecambe Lodge, but soon the congregation increased to such a size that a proper church was needed. The Jesuits decided to dedicate the church to their order's founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola. For financial reasons the church was built in two stages. The first part, which included the sanctuary, was opened in 1903 and the exterior parts were completed in 1911. The architect, Benedict Williamson, converted to Catholicism and became a priest after being responsible for the design of several other churches in the south-east of England.History, St Boniface Tooting site. Retrieved 18 January 2013 The interior decoration of the church is notable for the significant mosaic glass illustrations in vivid colours of the birth of Christ and of the Sacred Heart, as well as the Stations of the Cross. These were in the opus sectile style much favoured by the Arts and Crafts movement at the time of construction. The interior of the church was not completed until 1925. The chapel of St Joseph at the back of the church is dedicated to the men of the parish who died in the First World War and their names are inscribed on the front of the altar. The High Altar and the communion rails are still present in the church. =School= The secondary school asked for by Cardinal Vaughan was founded on 10 September 1894 next door to the church, and was called St Ignatius' College. By the 1960s it needed greater capacity to be able to teach an increasing number of pupils and it moved to Enfield in 1968. It left behind a primary school, also dedicated to St Ignatius.St Ignatius RC Primary School Jesuits ceased in the 20th century to run the expanding primary school adjoining which is entrusted to the borough and financially to the Archdiocese of Westminster, while as a Roman Catholic school retaining a close relationship with the church. Parish The church is active pastorally. Many voluntary organisations run in the parish and its main premises. For example: *Major outreach to homeless including daily distribution of hot food to between 40 and 60 daily. *Meeting venue of many groups including Legion of Mary; Knights of St. John; AA; Al Anon. *Support for the Tottenham Refugee Alliance. *The St Ignatius Housing Association is supported.

He wrote a series of books on the history of the Islamic civilization (1928‚Äì1953), a famous autobiography (My Life, 1950), as well as an important dictionary of Egyptian folklore (1953).  Biography  After receiving a traditional religious education the University of Al-Azhar, he worked as qadi until 1926. He then taught Arabic literature at Cairo University, where he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Arts, until 1946. Ahmad Amin was one of the most brilliant intellectuals of his time: he was editor of the literary journals al-Risalah (1933) and al-Thakafa (1939), founder of Ladjnat al-ta'lif wa l-tardjama wa-l- nashr (\\"Literary Committee of Translation and Publication\\"). He worked as head of the culture department at the Egyptian Ministry of Education before leading the cultural division of the Arab League. He is most famous for his long history of Islamic culture, in three volumes (Fajr al-islam, 1928 ; Duha l-islam, 1933‚Äì1936 ; Zuhr al-islam, 1945‚Äì1953) which is the first attempt of its kind in the modern history of the Muslim world. He also left an autobiography (Hayati, 1950) while his main articles were published under the title Fayd al-khatir. Amin lectured on Egyptian literary history between the years of 1939 and 1946.A. M. H. Mazyad, Ahmad Amin, page 47. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1963. It was during this time that Amin stated his initial belief that Egyptians had not contributed to Arabic poetry during the Middle Ages the way other Arab populations had. Amin's student Shawqi Daif claimed that the dearth of properly published Egyptian works from the period made such a judgement tenuous, and suggested that he and Amin republish the Egyptian sections in anthologies of poetry from the period.A. M. H. Mazyad, Ahmad Amin, pg. 48.

Early years Khaled ibn Hashimi was born in 1875 in Syria, where he grew up. He studied in Paris and went on to become an officer in the French army. He served with the army in Morocco.J. Ruedy, Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation, (Bloomington, 2005), p. 109. Politics Khaled ibn Hashimi was well known in Algeria thanks to his grandfather's protracted struggle with the French, and he was commonly referred to as the Emir. In 1913, he signed the program of the Young Algerians. He went on to help establish the Union Franco-Alg√©rienne in 1914. Khaled continued to serve in the French army, and fought in the trenches during the First World War until he was struck down with Tuberculosis.L. Zack, \\"Early origins of Islamic activism in Algeria: the case of Khaled in post- World War I Algiers\\", Journal of North African Studies, 11:2 (2006). After the Jonnart Law was passed in 1919, Khaled split with other members of the Union Franco-Alg√©rienne such an Benthai, on the grounds that the Jonnart Law was insufficient. In the elections that followed in the same year, Khaled won a major victory. However he was feared by the colons who got the result overturned and rigged the election that followed in 1920. By 1923, Khaled was becoming frustrated with French intransigence, and was becoming isolated from his allies who feared his personal influence. Further, he had built up considerable debts which left him vulnerable to attack. The French government offered to pay off these debts if he would go into exile. He accepted this offer, withdrew from the election he was contesting, closed down his personal publication, and went into exile in Damascus. From there and from Paris, he continued to pursue his political program, but his influence declined.J. Ruedy, Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation, (Bloomington, 2005), p. 131. Over time, Khaled moved increasingly towards more secular and nationalist politics, appearing alongside communists and others. When Khaled died in January 1936, there was an outpouring of grief in Algeria. He became, for many, a symbol of Algerian nationalism. However, there has been some controversy over whether Khaled can be defined as a nationalist, due to his demands for Algerians to be able to maintain their Islamic identity and his association with secular nationalists in his later years, or whether he was an assimilationist, due to his demands for reform within the French system.

It was founded in 1895 and from its 108 ft tall bell tower, it is possible see the Isle of Wight.Corpus Christi, Boscombe, Jesuits in Britain Retrieved 19 January 2013 History =Founding= Entrance of the former Convent of the Cross, which neighbours the church and the primary school The first Catholic place of worship in Boscombe was created in 1887 when the Religious of the Cross moved into the area to make a foundation there. They purchased four and a half acres of land on which John Vertue, the first Bishop of Portsmouth, erected a small public chapel, an iron building bought from Lord Petre. This iron chapel was formally opened on New Year's Day 1888 and was served from Bournemouth by the Jesuit priest there, Father Charles de Lapasture SJ. The building of the convent itself started on 6 September 1888. A year later, a school was built next door, Corpus Christi Primary School.Corpus Christi History, Boscombe Catholics Retrieved 21 January 2013 If Corpus Christi church could be said to have had a founder, it would have to be Baroness Pauline von Hugel. She was the daughter of the Austrian nobleman, army officer and botanist Charles von H√ºgel (1795-1870) and sister of the theologian Friedrich von H√ºgel (1852-1925), and anthropologist Anatole von H√ºgel (1854-1928). With the school being built, there arose the need for a permanent church. The Baroness resolved to build a church that would meet the needs of both parishioners and the nearby Sisters, and to this end bought a property known as 'Holyrood' and two acres of land stretching from Christchurch Road to the Convent garden. =Construction= Building work on the church started in 1885. The architect was J. William Lunn from Malvern, Worcestershire who also designed St Catherine's Church in Chipping Campden and St Edmund Church in Southampton.Verey, David Gloucestershire Vol. 1 (London, 1970) p. 103 On 8 September 1896 it was opened by Bishop John Vertue. Baroness Pauline von Hugel decided to give the church to the Society of Jesus so that Father de Lapasture SJ became the first parish priest. The church was built to have a height of fifty metres along the nave and could accommodate a congregation of 400 people. =Enlargement= In 1926, Father Ralph Baines SJ became parish priest and he decided to enlarge the church. An extension fund was opened to be able to pay for the scheme which was estimated to cost ¬£15,000. Work commenced in August 1932 and was completed by March 1934. The enlarged church could hold 800 people with the most prominent new feature being a tower at 108 feet high. It was blessed by Bishop Cotter on 22 April 1934. =Reordering= In 1974, to meet the requirements set down by the Second Vatican Council, that the congregation should all have a clear view of the altar, the sanctuary was again modified with the altar being moved forward. On completion of this work, the church was consecrated by Bishop Derek Worlock, on 18 July 1974. Parish The Jesuits still serve the church. In 2007, their presence in the area expanded with the opening of the Corpus Christi Jesuit Community Care Home adjacent to the church.13 September 2007, Jesuits in Britain Retrieved 22 January 2013 Corpus Christi has a number of parish groups and organisations, prayer groups, music groups and choirs. Also, next door to the church is Corpus Christi Primary School. It is a voluntary-assisted school for children from the ages of 4 to 11 years. Unlike the church, it is not served by the Jesuits, but as it under the trusteeship of the Diocese of Portsmouth so it has a close relationship with the parish.Governors Page, Corpus Christi Primary School Retrieved 19 January 2013 Interior Corpus Christ Church interior, Boscombe.jpgInterior Corpus Christ Church side chapel, Boscombe.jpg Side chapel Corpus Christ Church martyrs chapel, Boscombe.jpg Martyrs chapel Corpus Christ Church lady chapel, Boscombe.jpgLady chapel See also * Society of Jesus * Boscombe References External links * Corpus Christi Parish site Category:Buildings and structures in Bournemouth Category:Jesuit churches in the United Kingdom Category:Roman Catholic churches in Dorset Category:Grade II listed churches in Dorset Category:Grade II listed Roman Catholic churches in England Category:1895 establishments in England Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1934 ","title":"Corpus Christi Church, Boscombe"},{"id":"38355071","text":"A female coffee farmer at a field training school Coffee is Uganda's top- earning export crop. In 1989 Uganda's coffee production capacity exceeded its quota of 2.3 million bags, but export volumes were still diminished by economic and security problems, and large amounts of coffee beans were still being smuggled out of Uganda for sale in neighbouring countries. Some coffee farmers cultivated cocoa trees on land already producing robusta coffee. Cocoa production declined in the 1970s and 1980s, however, and market conditions discouraged international investors from viewing it as a potential counterweight to Uganda's reliance on coffee exports. Locally produced cocoa was of high quality, however, and the government continued to seek ways to rehabilitate the industry. Coffee production remained low during the late 1980s, rising from 1,000 tons in 1986 to only 5,000 tons in 1989. The Uganda Coffee Development Authority was formed in 1991 by government decree, in line with the liberalization of the coffee industry. Robusta coffee grows natively in the Kampala forest area and the Lake Victoria Crescent. From 1999 to 2002 an effort was made to commercialize this coffee as a premium consumer brand, emulating and extending the success of shade grown in Central America.The Kibale Wild Coffee Project, an initiative that involved international organizations such as the World Bank and United States Agency for International Development, aimed to implement sustainable harvest of coffee from Uganda's natural reserves and guarantee compensation for all workers involved in the harvest. Revenue from the coffee production was intended to finance conservation management activities. Coffee berries on a branch Arabica coffee grows around the slopes of Mount Elgon. The coffee was introduced to Uganda from Ethiopia and naturalised along the slopes of Mount Elgon. Production Trends = 1980s = Coffee continued to be Uganda's most important cash crop throughout the 1980s. The government estimated that farmers planted approximately 191,700 hectares of robusta coffee, most of this in south-eastern Uganda, and about 33,000 hectares of arabica coffee in high- altitude areas of south-eastern and south western Uganda. These figures remained almost constant throughout the decade, although a substantial portion of the nation's coffee output was smuggled into neighbouring countries to sell at higher prices. Between 1984 and 1986, the European Economic Community (EEC) financed a coffee rehabilitation program that gave improved coffee production a high priority. This program also supported research, extension work, and training programs to upgrade coffee farmers' skills and understanding of their role in the economy. Some funds were also used to rehabilitate coffee factories. When the National Resistance Movement seized power in 1986, Museveni set high priorities on improving coffee production, reducing the amount of coffee smuggled into neighbouring countries, and diversifying export crops to reduce Uganda's dependence on world coffee prices. To accomplish these goals, in keeping with the second phase of the coffee rehabilitation program, the government raised coffee prices paid to producers in May 1986 and February 1987, claiming that the new prices more accurately reflected world market prices and local factors, such as inflation. The 1987 increase came after the Coffee Marketing Board launched an aggressive program to increase export volumes. Parchment (dried but unhulled) robusta producer prices rose from USh24 to USh29 per kilogram. Clean (hulled) robusta prices rose from USh44.40 to USh53.70 per kilogram. Prices for parchment arabica, grown primarily in the Bugisu district of south-eastern Uganda, reached USh62.50 a kilogram, up from USh50. Then in July 1988, the government again raised coffee prices from USh50 per kilogram to USh111 per kilogram for robusta, and from USh62 to USh125 per kilogram for arabica. By December 1988, the Coffee Marketing Board was unable to pay farmers for new deliveries of coffee or to repay loans for previous purchases. The board owed USh1,000 million to its suppliers and USh2,500 million to the commercial banks, and although the government agreed to provide the funds to meet these obligations, some of them remained unpaid for another year. Uganda was a member of the International Coffee Organization (ICO), a consortium of coffee-producing nations that set international production quotas and prices. The ICO set Uganda's annual export quota at only 4 percent of worldwide coffee exports. During December 1988, a wave of coffee buying pushed the ICO price up and triggered two increases of 1 million (60- kilogram) bags each in worldwide coffee production limits. The rising demand and rising price resulted in a 1989 global quota increase to 58 million bags. Uganda's export quota rose only by about 3,013 bags, however, bringing it to just over 2.3 million bags. Moreover, Uganda's entire quota increase was allocated to arabica coffee, which was grown primarily in the small southeastern region of Bugisu. In revenue terms, Uganda's overall benefit from the world price increase was small, as prices for robusta coffee‚Äîthe major export‚Äîremained depressed. In 1989 Uganda's coffee production capacity exceeded its quota of 2.3 million bags, but export volumes were still diminished by economic and security problems, and large amounts of coffee were still being smuggled out of Uganda for sale in neighbouring countries. Then in July 1989, the ICO agreement collapsed, as its members failed to agree on production quotas and prices, and they decided to allow market conditions to determine world coffee prices for two years. Coffee prices plummeted, and Uganda was unable to make up the lost revenues by increasing export volumes. In October 1989, the government devalued the shilling, making Uganda's coffee exports more competitive worldwide, but Ugandan officials still viewed the collapse of the ICO agreement as a devastating blow to the local economy. Fears that 1989 earnings for coffee exports would be substantially less than the US$264 million earned the previous year proved unfounded. Production in 1990, however, declined more than 20 percent to an estimated 133,000 tons valued at US$142 million because of drought, management problems, low prices, and a shift from coffee production to crops for local consumption. Some coffee farmers cultivated cocoa plants on land already producing robusta coffee. Cocoa production declined in the 1970s and 1980s, however, and market conditions discouraged international investors from viewing it as a potential counterweight to Uganda's reliance on coffee exports. Locally produced cocoa was of high quality, however, and the government continued to seek ways to rehabilitate the industry. Production remained low during the late 1980s, rising from 1,000 tons in 1986 to only 5,000 tons in 1989. = 1990s = After exiting the International Coffee Organization, the Ugandan government continued its efforts to vitalize its international coffee export economy. In 1991, the Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) was formed by government decree, in line with the liberalization of the coffee industry. The UCDA is administered by the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries. During its tenure in the 1990s, the UCDA oversaw an exponential increase in coffee exports. In part due to the high price of the commodity on the international market that compensated the low production rates coming out of the 1980s. During the period between 1993 and 1997, international sales of robusta coffee increased to 110,000 tons per year. = 2000s-today = Coffee production in Uganda eventually encountered another slow down at the turn of the century. One of the primary reasons for this export drop resulted from the decreased demand for coffee, and consequently, a lower market price for the commodity. Additionally, Uganda's capacity to produce coffee was hindered by the onset of a widespread case of coffee-wilt disease, a fungus-induced wilt that results in complete death of coffee plants. Trees that suffer from coffee-wilt disease are not salvageable, and must be completely rooted out before it can spread to other trees or the soil. By 2003, as many as 45% of the nation's robusta coffee trees died from coffee-wilt disease. As a result, exports dropped dramatically, falling from 143,441 tons in 2000 to 122,369 tons in 2004.Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) (1997-2003) 'Annual Report', Kampala: UCDA. https://ugandacoffee.go.ug/annual-reports Arabica Coffee Production Shade Trees Arabica coffee is usually grown in mixed farms with food crops for home consumption like beans, peanuts and bananas. It is mainly grown under shade trees that ensure sustainable coffee production. The leaves that fall from the shade trees provide manure for the coffee plants. In Mbale the planting season for Arabica coffee is between March and April and harvesting is between August and November. The coffee trees are pruned from December to February before the planting season. The trees flower during the dry season. =Post harvesting= Arabica coffee initially goes through wet processing, which involves pulping (removal of pulp and mucilage) and washing the coffee beans. Pulping is the removal of the outer skin of the harvested red coffee berries. After pulping the mucilage around the bean is removed by use of water. The coffee beans are washed in a sisal made basket known as a washing basket. The farmer then has two options for drying their coffee beans. Either they dry them under the sun until they reach the required moisture content or pays to have them dried at a coffee factory. The remaining process involves removing the coffee husks, sorting of the different coffee bean sizes, roasting, grinding and packaging.

Rwenzori.jpgWomen sorting coffee from Rwenzori Mountains  Robusta Coffee Production  Robusta coffee, which is made from the plant coffea canephora, mainly grows in the Lake Victoria Basin. It is known for low acidity and high bitterness in relation to coffee made from coffea arabica. Robusta beans tend to grow in lower altitudes than those of Arabica beans, ranging between 200‚Äì800 meters above sea level. It is also a more robust crop in terms of production because it generates more obtainable product per area than arabica does and the costs of harvesting its coffee beans is substantially lower than arabica. Another unique advantage of the robusta strain of the plant is its relative resilience to wilts and plant diseases, making it a less risky crop to rely on. However because of its high bitterness, it is considered to be a less popular on the global market in relation to arabica. However despite being a more plentiful crop that is resilient to disease, robusta coffee is particularly susceptible to climate change. Studies project that a 2 degree Celsius increase in temperature can severely reduce the amount of coffea canephora that can grow in Uganda.pulping process Kibale Wild Coffee Project = Purpose = Robusta coffee grows natively in the Kibale forest area. From 1999 to 2002 an effort was made to commercialize this coffee as a premium consumer brand, emulating and extending the success of shade grown in Central America. Revenue from the coffee production was intended to finance conservation management activities. Initial funding for project development came from USAID. The project was implemented with funding from the Ford Foundation and $750,000 from the World Bank Global Environment Facility. The project had initial success in setting up local production standards, procedures, and control infrastructure. Initially it was led by the Uganda Coffee Trade Federation, until the independent US-based non-profit Kibale Forest Foundation was created to take over the project. The Kibale Forest Foundation, which was fully acknowledged and officiated by Uganda's government, was primarily tasked with inspecting the processes of wild coffee harvest and ensuring that the workers involved in this production were compensated. Compensation included both direct payment via wages as well as predetermined public projects, which were planned in accordance with community preferences.LILIEHOLM, ROBERT J., and W. PAUL WEATHERLY. ‚ÄúKibale Forest Wild Coffee: Challenges to Market-Based Conservation in Africa.‚Äù Conservation Biology, vol. 24, no. 4, 2010, pp. 924‚Äì930. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40864191. Accessed 12 May 2020. Sustainable annual yield was estimated at . Reducing gender inequality was another objective of the project. Women at the time were the bulk of the agricultural workforce, responsible for 50% of cash crop production, which includes coffee. Part of enforcing quality standards of coffee production chains in Uganda was to ensure that there were no more wage disparities between men and women. Organic certification was delivered by the Swedish KRAV labeling firm ever since 1994.Gibbon, Peter. A Short History of Certified Organic Export Production in Uganda. Danish Institute for International Studies, 2006, pp. 1‚Äì3, AN OVERVIEW OF THE CERTIFIED ORGANIC EXPORT SECTOR IN UGANDA, www.jstor.org/stable/resrep15684.5. Accessed 12 May 2020. One method of organic certification was through the implementation of the Export Promotion of Organic Production Program (EPOPA), which provides assistance for achieving certification and establishing internal control systems (ICSs) for project marketing. = Dissolution = It was subsequently discovered that there was no demand for the product, as the robusta variety is perceived as inferior to arabica coffee typically demanded by the premium market. Various blending schemes were turned down by coffee distributors. Project leaders estimated that $800,000 in marketing expenditure would be required to create demand.

Bega Begum began the tradition of commissioning monuments in the Mughal Empire, when she had her husband's mausoleum commissioned in the late 16th century, Humayun's Tomb at Delhi. This first colossal monumental mausoleum in Islamic India can be considered an early masterpiece that was to decisively influence the design of the later Taj Mahal, the high point of Mughal architecture. Early years and marriage Bega Begum was a Persian from Khurasan and was the daughter of Humayun's maternal uncle (taghai), Yadgar Beg, who was the brother of Sultan Ali Mirza, father of Kamran Mirza's wife Gulrukh Begum. She was a wise, well educated woman and had profound knowledge of medicine and treatment also. Bega married her first cousin, Prince Nasir ud-din (later known as 'Humayun' upon his accession) in 1527. The marriage took place while Humayun was in Badakshan during his second term as Viceroy of the province (1527-1529). In November of 1528, she gave birth to Humayun's first child and son, Shahzada Al-aman Mirza. The imperial couple were tremendously congratulated by the Emperor Babur on the birth of an heir, although the connotation of his name, 'Al-aman', he thought ominous. The prince died in his infancy. Empress Upon Emperor Babur's death in December 1530, Humayun ascended the throne at twenty three-years of age, while Bega was just nineteen when she became empress. She subsequently came to India for the first time, while accompanying her husband. Bega was held in high regard by Humayun throughout his life and remained his favourite as well as his chief consort until his death. In 1531, Bega announced her second pregnancy to the imperial family after arriving in Agra from Kabul. Here, she gave birth to her last known child, a daughter, Aqiqa Sultan Begum. In 1539, Bega accompanied her husband to Chausa, Bengal, where she was taken as a prisoner by Sher Shah Suri, after a well developed surprise attack on the Mughal territory by Sher Shah's forces. According to Niccolao Manucci, she was the only Mughal empress to have ever been held captive. On the morning of 26 June 1539, Humayun learned about her captivity, he immediately sprang on a horse and collected a small guard consisting of four nobles, Tardi Beg, Baba Beg, Koch Beg, and MrBachka Bahadur. Endeavouring to save the empress, they attempted to fight their way through the Afghan crowd and in doing so all except Tardi Beg were cut down. He alone returned to Humayun. The Tazkirat-ul-umard mentions the death of one Mir Pehlwan Badakshi. Initially, two faithful officers - Baba Julair and Que Beg - while zealously attempting to execute the emperor's orders, courted \\"martyrdom at the door of Her Majesty's enclosure\\" and were slain at the entrance of the private tents. While in captivity, the empress was treated by Sher Shah with the utmost courtesy and respect and he had her returned to Humayun escorted by his most trusted general, Khwas Khan. Unfortunately, the ordeal at Chausa led to death of her eight-year-old daughter, Aqiqa Sultan Begum, on 27 June. Humayun became extremely devastated and regretted ever bringing his daughter to Chausa in the first place. He blamed himself, confessing to his younger brother Hindal Mirza, 'In the earlier disturbance, Aqiqa Bibi [his daughter] had disappeared and I suffered from everlasting regret why I had not killed her myself' [lest she fall into the enemy's hands], a sentiment that his brother entirely endorsed. Bega was also with Humayun throughout his long exile in Persia at the court of the Safavid dynasty. She also took an active interest in the affairs of the state. Bega Begum's brother-in-law, Zahid Beg, was favoured when he was appointed Governor of Bengal which the latter declined. Humayun wanted to punish him but she interceded, though in vain, to seek the Emperor's pardon for him. =Dowager empress= When Humayun died in 1556, Bega Begum grieved so deeply over her husband's death that she dedicated her life thenceforth to a sole purpose: the construction of the most magnificent mausoleum in the empire, at a site near the Yamuna River in Delhi for the memorial of the late emperor. Bega Begum undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina for Hajj in 1564, accompanied by her sister-in-law, Gulbadan Begum, but before starting on her absence from the Court for three years, she made arrangements for the construction of the mausoleum at her own cost. She returned from Hajj in 1567, then led a retired life at Delhi and supervised the project. The empress' choice of architect for the construction of the mausoleum was the Persian architect, Mirak Mirza Ghiyas. Bega Begum was interested in patronizing education and so she established a madrasa near the mausoleum. She was also responsible for the construction of the Arab Sarai near the tomb. Death Humayun's Tomb, commissioned by Bega Begum, where she was later buried. Bega Begum died in 1582 in Delhi, after a brief illness, and was mourned by her step-son, the Emperor Akbar; whom she shared an extremely close relationship with. Akbar was, in fact, so attached to her that many people, as Akbar himself confirmed, mistook her to be his real mother and confused her with his biological mother, Hamida Banu Begum. \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni (Badauni) called Bega Begum 'second mother to the Emperor [Akbar]'. Akbar escorted her body to Humayun's Tomb for her burial. Legacy During the Mughal era (sixteenth to nineteenth century) the practice of commissioning monuments received a fillip through the efforts of Bega Begum with the construction of Humayun's Tomb. This first colossal monumental mausoleum in Islamic India can be considered an early masterpiece that was to decisively influence the design of the later Taj Mahal, the high point of Mughal architecture. The mausoleum was principally based on Persian architectural vocabularies, but was cleverly Indianized. The surrounding garden was also the first prodigious materialization of the form of the Persian 'Chahar Bagh' (Quartered Garden) in India. The mausoleum is the best representative monument in the Indian capital (Delhi) of the past authority of the Mughal Empire. References Bibliography Three Memoirs of Homayun.

Companies engaging in fan sourcing first determine who their fans are. Then the company engages with those fans and gives them opportunities to contribute by submitting their own ideas or working directly with customers through live chat services or other individualized customer engagement. The goal of fan sourcing is to connect potential customers with fans who are knowledgeable and passionate about the products that those potential customers are interested in. This system is very different from its main alternative, call centers, because fans are typically very enthusiastic and excited to make product recommendations. Those who use fan sourcing are motivated by the opportunities it provides for them to engage directly with their fans, and for the amount of work they are able to outsource at a much lower cost. Fans are intrinsically motivated to participate because they are already ardent supporters of the company. In many cases the fans may be rewarded monetarily or with free or discounted products. Applications Although Needle first coined the term fan sourcing, there are now at least five main companies offering solutions that offer a fan sourcing model for businesses: Needle, BzzAgent, Zuberance, BoldChat, LivePerson, and WildFire by Google. When potential customers browse on a company's e-commerce website, they have the opportunity to connect with a representative‚Äîwhat Needle calls a Needler‚Äîwho answers product questions and gives them recommendations. \\"Essentially, [fan sourcing] puts your existing customer base‚Äîthose who've used and know your product or service firsthand and are avid fans‚Äîto work as active brand advocates.\\" A case study of Skullcandy released in 2011 revealed an increase of 15% in average order value, 186% in return on investment, and 20% in overall conversion rate within one year of using fan sourcing. The study attributed these increases to the socialized, organic nature of fan sourcing, and the fact that it uses brand advocates rather than traditional customer service options such as FAQs or call centers. Criticisms Aside from the traditional criticisms of crowd sourcingCrowdsourcing#Limitations and controversies as a whole, the main criticism of fan sourcing is that it overlaps too much with other similar terms such as crowd sourcing, social media marketing, and affiliate marketing. Overall, critics are unsure where to place fan sourcing in the digital marketing landscape.

It contributes to the promotion of human rights and seeks to promote reflection on the present. It was created in 1999 and is currently composed of eight human rights organizations: Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, Buena Memoria Civil Association, Center for Legal and Social Studies, Vesubio and Puente 12 Victims' Tribute Commission, Commission for Memory, Truth and Justice of the Northern Zone, Relatives of Disappeared and Arrested for Political Reasons, Historical and Social Memory Foundation of Argentina, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo - Founding Line and Service Peace and Justice.  History  In 1999, a group of human rights organizations began to meet, seeking to participate in a coordinated way in local and national initiatives in favor of the memory of the last dictatorship in Argentina. The main objective was to contribute to the elaboration of the memory of what happened during State terrorism and to the construction of a later democracy to strengthen and promote respect for human rights. The participating organizations came together with the conviction that a joint action would make them stronger in their struggle. The initial work of Memoria Abierta included actions aimed at founding a Memory Museum, an extensive program of archival treatment of historical-institutional documents of human rights organizations and the construction of an Oral Archive of testimonies in film format on State terrorism. Later on were added works towards the task of systematization of photographs in a Photographic Archive and the production resources for the visualization of spaces of repression and resistance and their transformation into memory sites. Memoria Abierta participated in the founding of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience. In this space, coordinates the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Sites of Memory promoting the development of initiatives that stimulate reflection on human rights violations committed in these countries and their consequences in the present.  Archives  Memoria Abierta implements a documentary treatment program. In this framework, it established common guidelines and standards for the cataloging and standardization of the different archives it gathers (documentaries, photographic, audiovisual). It applies international standards of description and a specialized Thesauri on Human Rights. The Oral Archive of Memoria Abierta produces and gives access to testimonies related to the period of State terrorism, to the social and political life of the 1960s and 1970s and to the different actions promoted by human rights organizations and civil society in the search for truth and justice. It is composed of interviews to people whose lives have been affected in various ways by state terrorism. These testimonies are ordered, cataloged and arranged for public consultation in order to facilitate the study and interpretation of Argentine recent past from the point of view of the actors involved. The Memoria Abierta archives were included in the \\"Memory of the World\\" Register of the UNESCO as part of the \\"Documentary Heritage on Human Rights in Argentina for the period 1976-1983. Archives for Truth, Memory and Justice in the face of State terrorism\\".  Sites  It produces tools that make \\"visible\\" the sites used by repression. Identifies together with local counterparts, Clandestine Detention Centers in the Argentine territory and collaborates in the recovery processes of these places to turn them into memory sites. Memoria Abierta elaborates different types of resources that are regularly incorporated into the processes of judging the crimes of the dictatorship since the mid-2000s, at the request of the investigating magistrates or courts that are involved in oral and public trials in different parts of the country. Memoria Abierta also participate in judicial investigations through expert reports, archival advice and the supply of documentation requested by the courts  International Work  Memoria Abierta works in partnership to rebuild social trust and promote cooperation within civil society and with state entities in a process of strengthening democratic institutions. It maintains different links and develops projects and activities with different organizations with the objective of exchanging and sharing their experience and work methodologies, as well as the characteristics of the Argentine process of truth and justice with other transitional processes of the world. In this context, it shares strategies, lessons learned and specific methodologies related to the organization and preservation of archives (including oral archives), to topographic research with different sites within Argentina, in the region and in different countries of the world. , The institutions that make up the Latin American and Caribbean Network, which Memoria Abierta has been coordinating since 2006, are working to recover and construct collective reports on the serious violations of human rights and resistance in the region during the recent past, in periods of State terrorism, internal armed conflict and high levels of impunity, with the aim of promoting democracy and guarantees of non- repetition. The Latin American and Caribbean Network of Memory Sites develops projects, initiatives, joint trainings that seek to strengthen the integration between institutions with similar perspectives.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on July 15, 1939, and stars Porky Pig. Plot Porky is riding his way over to his girlfriend, Petunia's home. Upon arrival he knocks on her door and asks her if she would like to go on a picnic with him. So she goes upstairs and get her basket. While they are walking they pass a window where Pinkie is asleep but overheard the conversations and decides to tag along. And so, on their way they see Pinkie and quickly catch him. Porky tells him that if he behaves, he would tell the baby a story. Pinkie pulls the nail out of side-car of Porky's bike, causing it to become separated and both pieces of vehicle go on separate paths. Pinkie has fun while Petunia panics and covers her eyes. After they pass a speeding train, the vehicle re-connects and Porky just finishes his story. Pinkie claims it was the best story he \\"never\\" heard and they soon arrive to the park. Porky decides he wants to take a nap as Pinkie watches a small squirrel. He grabs a pair of scissors and proceeds to chase around the poor squirrel. Petunia manages to grab him and lays him down for a nap next to Porky. As she leaves however, Pinkie gets up and smacks Porky with a big wooden plank. Porky awakes with a start but sees nobody nearby, other than a sleeping Pinkie. As he tries to get back to sleep, Pinkie is about to strike again but Porky catches him and asks what he was about do with the wood plank. Pinkie begins to explain, but ends up smacking him repeatedly with the plank of wood before skipping away. Porky then grumpily lies on his side as Pinkie skips his way into the zoo, past a sleeping crocodile/alligator. Petunia begins to shout and tells Porky of Pinkie's location in the zoo. Soon Porky finds Pinkie sleeping with a big cat and its babies. Porky sneaks into the cage and quickly tries to escape being eaten by the big cat. He gets out to grab a faint Petunia after putting down Pinkie, then they resume chase until they manage to get the cat stuck in the metal bars. As Porky returns to Petunia he falls into the mud. But Petunia doesn't mind and she kisses him anyway! Seeing the squirrel again, Pinkie prepares to cut it with the scissors. Unfortunately, Pinkie didn't count on the squirrel having its own smaller plank of wood and the squirrel hits Pinkie with it repeatedly until Pinkie surrenders and the cartoon ends.

She was conferred the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2010.  Early life and education  Berkson was born in New York in 1924. She majored in history at the Duke University and after graduation, studied sculpture at the Columbia University under Milton Hebald. She is married to Martin Fleisher a batchmate of hers from Duke.  Work in India  By the time she first visited India in 1970 Berkson had been a practising sculptor for 22 years. That trip, during which she visited Elephanta, Ellora and Mahabalipuram, was a transformative one for her. Berkson soon gave up her career as a sculptor and began to tour India to study its important architectural and cultural sites. In 1977 she moved her main residence to Mumbai in India to continue with her research into the philosophy, mythology and artistic developments in Indian sculpture.  Notable works  = Sculpture = Berkson is noted for both her documentation and commentary on Indian art as well as her own work as a sculptor. She took up sculpting again in 2001 after a hiatus of nearly three decades. Most of her sculptures are renditions of figures from Indian mythology but reflect cubist influences in their depiction. Her work while drawing from and alluding to Hindu, Christian and Buddhist mythology are noted for their simple, clean forms that reflect a modern aesthetic. Some of her sculptures are those of Lakshmi and Vishnu as horse and mare, bronze statues of Shiva as Apsamara and of Vishnu atop Garuda. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York has in its possession a collection of her photographs of ancient Indian sculpture. =Books= Berkson is the author of several books on Indian art. These include: * Elephanta, the cave of Shiva * The caves at Aurangabad: early Buddhist tantric art in India * The divine and demoniac: Mahisa's heroic struggle with Durga * Ellora, concept and style * The life of form in Indian sculpture * Indian sculpture : towards the rebirth of aesthetics.  Awards and honours  The Government of India honoured Berkson by conferring the Padma Shri on her in 2010. Berkson announced her retirement from work and plans to return to the USA later that year. She donated 38 of her sculptures to the permanent collection at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai in 2011.

Another early confirmed account of slavery in the colony came in 1638 when several native prisoners were taken during the Pequot War were exchanged in the West Indies for African slaves. Such exchanges become common in subsequent conflicts. Legal History of Abolition in Connecticut Connecticut blocked the importation of slaves in 1774, via the passage in the state legislature of the \\"Act for Prohibiting the Importation of Indian, Negro or Molatto Slaves\\" and began a gradual emancipation of slaves in 1784, through the passage by the state legislature of the \\"Gradual Abolition Act\\" of that year. Through this \\"freeing the womb\\" act, all slaves born after March 1, 1784, would become free upon attaining the age of 25 for men and 21 for women, though it did not free the parents, or any other adult slaves. In 1844, Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin proposed legislation to end slavery, but the General Assembly did not pass it until it was reintroduced in 1848 as \\"An Act to Prevent Slavery\\". Connecticut's last enslaved person, Nancy Toney of Windsor, died in December of 1857. Prevalence of slavery According to Anne Farrow, Joel Lang, and Jenifer Frank, \\"In 1790 most prosperous merchants in Connecticut owned at least one slave, as did 50 percent of the ministers. ...Our economic links to slavery were deeply entwined with our religious, political, and educational institutions. Slavery was part of the social contract in Connecticut.\\" According to U.S. census data there were 2,764 enslaved human beings in Connecticut as of 1790, a little over 1% of the population at the time. This declined during the early part of the 19th century, with the census indicating numbers (percentages) reported as enslaved human beings in the State of 951 (.34%) in 1800, 97 (.04%) in 1820 and 25 (.008%) by 1830.

Shaw, Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and the Visualization of History in the Late Ottoman Empire, 48. As an industrialist he was intent on bringing the Ottoman Empire into the modern age. Ahmed started steel factories and the famous Beykoz porcelain factory, which carried the insignia Product of Istanbul (Eser-i Istanbul). In 1846, Ahmed, now marshal of the Imperial arsenal,Wendy M.

He was buried in the northeastern corner of the cemetery behind the Congregational church in Suffield, CT. Early life Old Ti was born in 1787, and lived nearly his entire early life in Suffield, CT. He was born to a family of slaves owned by the town preacher, Reverend Ebenezer Gay Jr. His mother, Rose Gay, was a princess in Africa and had previously belonged to Gay. His father Maj Elihu Kent was owned by another large, wealthy Suffield family, the Kents. A slave in colonial America Family life According to Judge Smith‚Äôs Old Slave Days in Connecticut Judge Smith's Old Slave Days in Connecticut Titus was in love with a female slave known only as Phill. Shortly after running from her master she died. According to Smith, Phill dies on the run, a victim of the brutally cold Connecticut winter. Though Titus and Phill were never actually married (she died before they had the chance) this is the closest known instance in which Titus had any sort of love life. Old Ti was allegedly buried next to Phill. Old Ti never had any children. He was dedicated to his community and church, once he became a free man Titus would work in the church to make ends meet. Both of Titus's parents were slaves. Rose Gay, his mother served Reverend Ebenezer Gay of Suffield, CT. Titus Kent, his father, was owned by Maj. Elihu Kent, also of Suffield. Both Maj.

Free man Titus was emancipated at the age of twenty-five by the Gradual Emancipation Act that was passed in 1784. Even though Titus was no longer Reverend Gay‚Äôs slave, he was still very much involved in the town. One of Titus‚Äôs most coveted jobs was working as a tythingman. This job consisted of assisting funerals with the pastor. He made sure things in the church ran smoothly. Working as a tythingman was not the only job that Titus had. He was also the sexton, the gravedigger, the custodian of the church, and the church bell ringer. He was very much involved in the community. In the 1820s there was a day once a year called training day. Training day was a day where the town celebrated their local militia with a parade. Titus was in charge of keeping the little boys of the town out of trouble. The parents trusted him with their children.

The show also features David Plant as \\"Terry\\". Overview Paddy McGuinness uses his 10-foot plasma television and \\"Paddy Player\\" to offer a guide through life.

The show was universally panned by critics. Nick Norton of \\"Off the Box\\" said \\"The premise of Paddy's TV Guide, in which the host presents a series of lamentable clips from wretched television shows, all on a set theme each episode, is of little consequence. What is remarkable is the line in the credits that tells us it was \\"Adapted from an original TV format by Paddy McGuiness and ITV\\". Which means that either ITV thought the show was too substandard even for the dreck it fills ITV2's schedule with, or Channel 4 actually paid good money to take it off its hands. Either way, shame on Channel 4. As [Stewart] Lee himself might say, to watch it really is the equivalent of letting somebody straddle your face and defecate directly onto your eyeballs.\\" Shouting at Cows's Pippa Harris said: \\"Paddy's TV Guide is the kind of curve ball Channel 4 likes to throw in amongst Homeland and documentaries about dolphin murder and the alarming 5 minute thought-provokers like Random Acts. Into the mix will suddenly appear something that seems to have burst through the wall from next door at ITV, offerings like the eejit- whisperers of Tool Academy, the now defunct Love Shaft, and the chat shows they keep trying to give to any female celebrity that can make it through a comedy panel show without clawing Jimmy Carr's face off (remember Charlotte Church's chat show? Anyone?). The rest of it drones on with a smattering of sub-Hill physical sketches and commentary that adds about as much as those dialogue boxes that pop up in front of YouTube clips. I don't think any of this is really Paddy's fault ‚Äì the problem is this format has been done before and much better; he's out of his depth. If he must be on the goggle-box, someone needs to lead him back towards the neon glow of the gameshow.\\". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy was highly critical of the show: \\"...occasionally a TV monster does cross my path and bewitches with me its sheer awfulness. Celebrity Wrestling, The Farm, \\"TOWIE Live\\", Mark Wright's Hollywood Nights and now joining that list is Paddy's TV Guide. ...Paddy's TV Guide is a weird mix of not particularly amusing video clips and buttock-clenchingly awful editing that squeezes hysterical audience laughter on top of every inoffensive but utterly unamusing comment from the show's host.\\" Fletcher concluded his review by saying: \\"Bafflingly bad, Paddy will do well to wipe this whole project from his wiki page and pretend it never happened if he knows what's best for him.\\" Redbrick.me's Rosie Pooley slated the programme as well. She said, \\"I guarantee that 10 minutes spent on youtube will bring up funnier material than Paddy manages to muster. What Channel 4 has yet to realise is that when Paddy is not swinging out the one-liners with a group of 30 girls lapping up every word, every joke he fluffs up falls flat and makes Paddy‚Äôs TV Guide frankly awkward to watch.\\" See Also * Clive James/Floyd on Television/Tarrant on TV - a similar show made by ITV between 1982 - 2006 References External links  * Category:2010s British comedy television series Category:2013 British television series debuts Category:2013 British television series endings Category:Channel 4 comedy Category:English- language television shows Category:Television series about television Category:Television series by ITV Studios ","title":"Paddy's TV Guide"},{"id":"38355506","text":"The New Life is the second album by Northern Irish band Girls Names.

For example, in the following example, the change from \\"saw\\" (past tense) to \\"is\\" (present tense) represents a tense confusion: * \\"He saw that she is very tall.\\" Prescriptive sources claim tense confusions hurt reader comprehension, and that they are a common grammatical error, especially among beginning writers. From the perspective descriptive linguistics, however, this type of sentence has a clear motivation. There is, in fact, a meaning contrast between the following two sentences. This meaning contrast is lost when so-called \\"tense confusions\\" are prescribed against. * \\"He noticed that she ran every day\\" (implicature: she no longer runs every day or whether or not she still runs, he cannot validly conclude that she does) * \\"He noticed that she runs every day\\" (no such implicature) The first sentence implies that the proposition \\"she runs every day\\" no longer holds, while the second doesn't.

Inventory in these cases needs to be maintained for an extended time to allow for repairs and product support perhaps as much as two or more decades after a manufacturer has ceased production. Traditional inventory management techniques break down in cases where a manufacturer maintains inventory to supply future maintenance of their in-service equipment. As demand for goods approaches zero, liquidation of inventory is indicated in most revenue management models. Zero inventory to service products in the field, however, fails the organization in other business areas. Possible costs to manufacture replacement inventory and the harder-to-calculate costs of customer confidence erosion can be greater over time than the immediate financial concerns that are remedied by liquidating inventory entirely by scrapping or discarding it as waste.‚ÄúAre Your Inventory Management Practices Outdated,‚Äù AberdeenGroup, 1 March 2005. While scrapping returns inventory to a state of raw materials, Partner-Optimized Inventory Management (PIM) returns inventory to the market as intermediate goods to be used in production of other goods or non-capital spare parts. An organization that uses the PIM model mitigates the immediate pinch point caused by inventory reduction by retaining as-needed mutual access to inventory through the marketplace for an indeterminate time rather than losing access immediately and irrevocably through scrapping or discarding the inventory as waste.

Paul initiated for his Friars of the Atonement devotion to the Blessed Mother invoked under the title, ‚ÄúOur Lady of the Atonement‚Äù,\\"Our Lady of the Atonement\\", Franciscan Friars of the Atonement adapting prayers to Our Lady of Sorrows. That same year, he and Society of Atonement co-founder, Mother Lurana White, established the Rosary League of Our Lady of the Atonement. In the early 1900s Wattson was a popular preacher in Episcopal churches, and Mother Lurana edited a small magazine called ‚ÄúRose Leaves from Our Lady‚Äôs Garden at Graymoor‚Äù. This brought a greater awareness of the devotion to the Episcopalian community. The title became popular common among Anglicans and Anglo-Catholics who have a similar devotion in their liturgical traditions. In 1909 the Society of the Atonement entered the Roman Catholic Church. In 1919, the title was formally approved by Pope Benedict XV. In the September 1932 issue of The Lamp, Father Paul wrote, \\"When we, therefore, give to our Blessed Mother the title of 'Our Lady of the Atonement', we mean 'Our Lady of Unity.'\\"\\"Our Lady of the Atonement\\", Father Paul of Graymoor Guild Her image was painted by Giovanni Martini in 1929 and by Mother Margaret Mary Nealis in 1933.

The post of Provost Marshal has existed since William of Cassingham was appointed by Henry III on 28 May 1241 (the original title was Sergeant of the Peace). During the Peninsula War from 1809‚Äì14, the Duke of Wellington asked for a Provost Marshal to be appointed to hang looters; by the end of the Peninsula War the Provost Marshal controlled 24 Assistant Provost Marshals. Members of this Staff Corps of Cavalry were identified by a red scarf tied around the right shoulder; whilst some consider this to have been the origin of the famous 'Red Cap' of the Royal Military Police and its forebears, it was more likely a precursor of the 'MP' armband (and now the Tactical Recognition Flash), which identifies the modern Military Policeman or Policewoman. Although disbanded in 1814 at the end of the Peninsular War, the Duke of Wellington re-formed the Staff Corps of Cavalry to police the occupying British Army in France following Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. Later, in the Crimean War, a Mounted Staff Corps of almost 100 troopers from the Police Constabulary of Ireland, with some recruited from the Metropolitan Police, was established to prevent the theft of supplies, and to maintain discipline in camps. This 'Corps' was disbanded with the cessation of hostilities. The Provost Marshal has always had men detached to assist him, an arrangement formalised by the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsula War; but only since 1877 has there existed a regular corps of military police. In that year, the Military Mounted Police (MMP) was formed, followed by the Military Foot Police (MFP) in 1885. The Military Mounted Police first engaged in combat in 1882 at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. Although technically two independent corps, the two effectively functioned as a single organisation. In 1926 they were fully amalgamated to form the Corps of Military Police (CMP). In recognition of their service in the Second World War, they became the Corps of Royal Military Police (RMP) on 28 November 1946 under Army Order 167. On 6 April 1992 the RMP lost its status as an independent corps, and together with the Military Provost Staff Corps, became the Provost Branch of the Adjutant General's Corps. It was, however, permitted to retain the name \\"Royal Military Police\\", together with its cap badge and other distinctive insignia including the red cap. On 5 March 1995, the Mounted Troop was disbanded after 118 years of service to the crown and the colours.

When the British Expeditionary Force was sent to France in that year, each division had one Assistant Provost Marshal in the rank of Major and several NCOs. The Provost Marshal was a Colonel until 1915, and a Brigadier- General thenceforward. During the retreat from Mons the MPs were busy dealing with soldiers who, through exhaustion or the general confusion of battle, had either lost or became detached from their units. By operating stragglers' posts, the MPs were able to return soldiers to their units. These posts were also well placed to pick out deserters and those Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL). The First World War was the conflict where traffic control became an important function. This was identified particularly after the Battle of Loos, when there was a lot of confusion involving two British divisions. As well as traffic control, the BEF provost units dealt with the maintenance of law and order (i.e. the detection of crime and the arrest of offenders), custody of prisoners of war until handed over to detention facilities, surveillance, control and protection of civilians. The work undertaken by MPs was not all carried out behind the lines, and sometimes they came under heavy fire. During this conflict, the Military Police suffered 375 casualties. Sixty-five received the Distinguished Conduct Medal and 260 received the Military Medal.

During the Second World War the Military Police grew from 4,121 all ranks to over 50,000 all ranks within six major branches of specialists: Provost Wing ‚Äì Responsible for general policing. Provost Companies were included in the order of battle of Home Commands, Armoured, Infantry and Airborne Divisions, as well as at Army and Corps level and with independent Brigades. From 1942, \\"Ports Provost\\" Companies were raised, consisting of a mix of Provost and Vulnerable Points Sections, which were deployed on security and policing duties within ports and docks. Field Security Wing ‚Äì First formed in 1937. Personnel wore Lincoln green cap covers and brass shoulder titles on their tunics with the letters \\"FSP\\", to distinguish them from the rest of the Corps. They wore the standard CMP cap badge, but unofficially ground down the wording \\"MILITARY POLICE\\" from the lower scroll of the badge. In July 1940 the Wing was absorbed into the new Intelligence Corps. Vulnerable Points Wing ‚Äì Formed in 1940 to provide security of static locations and establishments. They were known as \\"blue caps\\" from the Oxford blue cloth covers worn on their service dress caps. Originally intended to act as static Companies and detachments, VP Coys were later deployed in North West Europe, guarding prisoner of war camps and other static installations. The VP Wing was quickly phased out at the end of the war, but re-appeared briefly in the Supplementary Reserve/Army Emergency Reserve between 1950 and 1961. Special Investigation Branch ‚Äì Formed in 1940, with 19 detectives from the Metropolitan Police transferred to the Army for deployment in France. From this small beginning the Branch expanded into numerous Sections which were deployed both in the UK and overseas, providing the Corps with its own criminal investigation department to conduct more detailed and protracted investigations into organised crime and serious offences such as murder. Traffic Control Wing ‚Äì Formed in 1941, TC Coys were deployed throughout the United Kingdom, releasing Provost Companies from the tasks of traffic control. TC Coys were later deployed in the Middle East, Italy and North-West Europe. The Wing was phased out of the Corps by 1946. (Many sources over the years continue to erroneously state that personnel of the Traffic Control Wing wore white cloth cap covers. This is not the case. CMP (TC) personnel did not wear cap covers when on duty, unless they had undergone a basic course in police duties, in which case they were authorised to wear red top covers as per the Provost Wing). Some 950 Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Other Ranks of the Corps of Military Police were killed in action or died in service, a high proportion of the latter in traffic accidents; and several were murdered whilst carrying out their duties. In addition, 28 Officers were killed or died whilst serving with CMP units. =Operation Overlord= On 6 June 1944, the Allies launched Operation Overlord, the invasion of the European mainland. CMP units taking part included: * 101st Provost Company, CMP (on 18 July 1944 this company landed, under enemy attack, at Courseilles-Sur-Mer) * 150th Provost Company, CMP \\"The Battle of Normandy and subsequent battles would never have been won but for the work and co-operation of the Provost on the traffic routes.\\" (Field Marshal Montgomery, 1945) =Operation Market Garden= In 1944, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, the airborne assault to capture bridges over the Lower Rhine in the Netherlands. The 1st Airborne Division's 1st (Airborne) Divisional Provost Company captured the police station in Arnhem, but then suffered heavy losses when the II SS Panzer Corps counterattacked. =Operation Varsity= On 24 March 1945, the British 6th Airborne Division successfully launched Operation Varsity at Wesel, Western Germany. This airborne operation was part of the bigger Operation Plunder, the crossing of the Rhine. CMP units taking part in Operation Varsity were: * 6th (Airborne) Divisional Provost Company, CMP * HQ, 245th Provost Company, CMP CMP units taking part in Operation Plunder included: * 101 Provost Company, CMP, 15th (Scottish) Division CMP units also served with British units of the 14th Army in the Burma campaign 1944‚Äì1945 (e.g. 2nd Division) At war's end, General Sir Miles Dempsey paid the following tribute: \\"The Military Policeman became such a well known figure on every road to the battlefield that his presence became taken for granted. Few soldiers as they hurried over a bridge which was a regular target for the enemy, gave much thought to the man whose duty it was to stand there for hours on end, directing the traffic and ensuring its rapid passage\\". Supplementary Reserve and Territorial Army =Supplementary Reserve= In 1938, the Secretary of The Automobile Association (AA), Sir Stenson Cooke, a former member of the Military Foot Police, approached the War Office with an offer to raise a Supplementary Reserve for the Corps of Military Police, from employees of the AA. This offer was quickly accepted and 850 AA patrolmen signed on as members of the CMP (SR) by 1939. These were mobilised in September 1939 and used to raise new Provost Companies for the British Expeditionary Force in France and for Home Forces in the United Kingdom. In March 1940, 151 Provost Company, CMP was formed in France, predominantly from AA Supplementary Reservists, as the first Traffic Control Company in the British Army. It distinguished itself during the Battle of France but due to its high casualties was disbanded on returning to England in June 1940. The Supplementary Reserve was restarted in 1949 and renamed as the Army Emergency Reserve in 1951. Numerous RMP (AER) units were raised, administered by HQ RMP AER at Inkerman Barracks, Woking; these included Army and Corps Provost Companies and Vulnerable Points Companies as well as SIB Sections. The RMP AER recruited heavily from ex-Regular and National Service RMP personnel, as well as the civilian Police and Automobile Association. The annual training commitment of the AER units was lower than that of the TA, with personnel only required to attend one 15-day camp each year, with no weekly or monthly continuation training. In 1951 the composition of RMP AER was as follows; The RMP (AER) Pool ‚Äì comprising an establishment of 44 Officers and some 830 NCOs and Other Ranks, who would reinforce Regular Army and TA units in the event of mobilisation for war.

By 1961 this had been reduced to 243 (GHQ) Pro Coy, 161 Force Pro Unit, 162 and 163 Rear Area Pro Unit, 1 Port Task Force Pro Coy, RMP (AER), plus 81 and 82 Det (Rear Area) SIB, RMP (AER). =Territorial Army= In February 1939, as part of the reorganisation of the Territorial Army Field Forces announced the previous Autumn, the formation of thirteen Territorial Army Companies of the Corps of Military Police was authorised, on a scale on one for each TA Division. These Companies were raised from April 1939 onwards as follows; The Mobile Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì St Pancras, London; in November 1939 this was converted to No.2 Line of Communications Provost Company, CMP. 42 (East Lancashire) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Manchester. 43 (Wessex) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Salisbury and Bournemouth. 44 (Home Counties) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì St Pancras, London. 48 (South Midland) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Birmingham. 49 (West Riding) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Leeds. 50 (Northumbrian) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Hull. 51 (Highland) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Dundee. The bulk of this Company was captured at St Valery in June 1940 and a new Company under the same title had to be formed back in England. 52 (Lowland) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Glasgow. 53 (Welsh) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Llanelli. This converted to form 105th Provost Company, CMP in 1941 and a new 53rd Div Pro Coy was then formed. 54 (East Anglian) Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Chelmsford.

The London Division Provost Company, CMP (TA) ‚Äì Finsbury, London. In late 1939 it became 1 London Div Pro Coy and then 56 (London) Division Provost Company, CMP in November 1940. The TA was mobilised on September 1, 1939 and on September 6 ceased to exist, as it was merged with the Regular Army for the duration of the war. Early in 1940, each of the former TA Companies formed a second, duplicate, Company, normally by detaching one or more Sections to form the nucleus of the new unit, and in this way the 9 (Scottish), 12 (Eastern), 15 (Scottish), 18 (Eastern), 23 (Northumbrian), 38 (Welsh), 45 (Wessex), 46 (North Midland), 59 (Staffordshire), 61 (South Midland), 66 and 2 London (later 47) Division Provost Companies were raised. Not all the former TA Companies survived the war intact but by April 1946 the remaining units had been stood down. When the TA was reconstituted in January 1947, Provost Companies were once again formed for each Armoured, Airborne and Infantry Division in the TA, plus three Corps Provost Companies and several independent Brigade Provost Units. Successive reorganisations during the 1950s and 1960s altered the composition of the RMP (TA), units being raised as follows; 16 Airborne Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì London. In 1956 this became 44 Independent Parachute Brigade Group Provost Company, RMP (TA), with Sections in London and Liverpool. 42 (Lancashire) Infantry Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì Manchester.

In 1961 it became 44 (Home Counties) Division/District Provost Company, RMP (TA). 49 (West Riding and North Midland) Armoured Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì Leeds. In 1956 this became 49th (West Riding and North Midland) Infantry Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) and then North Midland District/49 Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) in 1961. 50 (Northumbrian) Infantry Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì Hull. It became Northumbrian District/50 Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) in 1961. 51/52 (Scottish) Infantry Division Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì Dundee.

This was redesignated in 1961 as The Northern Ireland Command Provost Company, RMP (TA). 161 (East Anglian) and 162 (East Anglian) Independent Infantry Brigade Provost Unit, RMP (TA) ‚Äì These two separate units were formed in 1950 at Chingford and Hemel Hempstead respectively. In 1956 they amalgamated to form 54 (East Anglian) Infantry Division Provost Company, RMP (TA), becoming 54 (East Anglian) Division/District Provost Company, RMP (TA) in 1961. 120 (Northern) Corps Provost Company, RMP (TA) ‚Äì Leicester.

The following RMP (Volunteers) units were formed; 163 (A.A) Ports Provost Company, RMP (V), 1 Port Task Force Provost Company, RMP (V) (later renumbered as 164 Provost Company) and 83 Section, SIB RMP (V). These were all located at Central Volunteer HQ RMP (V) at Rousillon Barracks, Chichester, and were successors to the former RMP AER units. The units continued to recruit heavily from the Automobile Association (163) and the civil Police (164). 243 Provost Company, RMP (V) ‚Äì HQ Edinburgh, Sections at Southampton and Belfast. Raised from 51 (Highland), 52 (Lowland), East Lowland District, Aldershot District and Northern Ireland Command Pro Coy, RMP (TA).

Cold War field glasses to look across the Berlin Wall from a viewing platform on the western side, 1984. In 1946 King George VI granted the 'Royal' prefix to the Corps of Royal Military Police (RMP) in recognition of its outstanding wartime record. (CRMP was chosen to avoid confusion with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or RCMP). In 1946, the Robertson-Malinin agreement introduced Military Missions into the post-war Control Zones of Germany. The Soviet Union maintained missions (SOXMIS) in the U.S., French and British zones. In the British sector the Soviet Mission was based in B√ºnde near Herford. British Forces maintained a mission (BRIXMIS) in the Soviet Zone (East Germany). The RMP had the task of policing the Soviet mission in B√ºnde, and this was tasked to 19 (Support) Platoon RMP, who became known as \\"white mice\\". This unit's job was to wait outside the Soviet mission until a SOXMIS vehicle appeared and then follow it. In restricted areas, Soviet vehicles were not permitted to leave the autobahns (not even in parking areas) unless accompanied by U.S., British or French military police. The agreements remained in force until 2 October 1990, when all three missions were deactivated on the eve of Germany's reunification. In Berlin, within 2 Regiment RMP, 247 Provost Company RMP was responsible for manning the British Sector checkpoints and Border Patrols. As part of 2 Regiment, an armed unit of German nationals, 248 German Security Unit, was maintained; its commander was a German national in the rank of Major and an RSM from a British infantry regiment acted as liaison officer. This was disbanded in 1994, when the British Garrison in Berlin was closed. A third company within the 2 Regiment was 246 Provost Company in Helmstedt. =Korean War= The Korean War was fought between 1950 and 1953.

Between 1948 and 1956, thirteen members of the RMP lost their lives in this conflict. Britain still maintains military forces in Brunei, including an RMP unit. =The Suez Canal Zone Emergency and Suez Crisis= Between 1951 and 1955, British forces stationed in the Suez canal zone were engaged in operations against terrorists. The RMP lost eight members during this emergency.

After the 1974 Greek coup-d'etat and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the UN Security Council extended and expanded the mission to prevent that Cyprus dispute turning into war. RMP have served with the Force Military Police Unit (FMPU), from the outset. The FMPU is 1 of only 2 multi-national sub units within UNFICYP, the other being the Mobile Force Reserve. The FMPU is commanded by a RMP major who is both OC FMPU and Provost Marshal. Seven other members of the RMP form the spine of the 25-strong unit.

After the Argentine forces surrendered, 5 Infantry Brigade Provost Unit RMP remained on the islands, sworn in as Special Constables until the Falkland Islands Police Force were able to become operational again. After the re-capture of South Georgia (Operation Paraquat), the Argentine commander Lieutenant-Commander Alfredo Astiz was taken to the UK and questioned by the RMP and Sussex Police at the Keep, Roussillon Barracks, Chichester about the murder of Swedish and French nationals several years before. As there was no jurisdiction for extradition to Sweden or France, he was repatriated to Argentina by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Post Cold War =Middle East: Operation Granby= In 1991, British forces as part of US-led coalition forces invaded Kuwait and Southern Iraq as part of Operation Desert Storm. The British name for this operation was Operation Granby. RMP units involved were: * 203 Provost Company RMP ‚Äì 7th and 4th Armoured Brigades (1 (British) Armoured Division).

RMP personnel have also been involved in the European Union Force (EUFOR), which took over in 2004. =Kosovo (Operation AGRICOLA)= On 12 June 1999, the UK sent 19,000 troops into Kosovo as part of KFOR. Lead units of the 5 Airborne Brigade, which included the Royal Engineers and RMP, had to deal with booby traps in road tunnels before the Force could advance into Kosovo and seize the Kaƒçanik defile. =Iraq (Operation TELIC)= On June 24, 2003, following the Invasion of Iraq, six Royal Military Police soldiers from 156 Provost Company of the 16 Air Assault Brigade were assaulted and killed by an Iraqi mob numbering several hundred at a police station in Majar al-Kabir in Southern Iraq. The town was known for banditry and lawlessness, its people insisting that they had liberated themselves from Ba'athist party occupation and did not want coalition troops there; British tactics in sweeping for weapons angered the population. Some of the soldiers were shot and others beaten to death. A couple of days after the incident, members of the British SAS arrived in the town, they then gathered intelligence on who was responsible and withdrew from the town under fire by armed Iraqis, however British military commanders discouraged the SAS from going back in and arresting those responsible.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.17-18 References External sources *A Short History of the Royal Military Police and its Antecedents Category:Military police of the United Kingdom Royal Military Police Category:Royal Military Police ","title":"History of the Royal Military Police"},{"id":"38355731","text":"Oxfordshire County Council may be: *Oxfordshire County Council *Oxford County Council (Maine) ","title":"Oxford County Council"},{"id":"38355732","text":"Frederick Gordon Pearce (24 March 1892UK, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960 for Frederick G Pearcem schoolmaster ‚Äì 1962) was an English educationist, who served in India and Ceylon.

The facility is an amalgamation of the United States Army's Fort Lewis and the United States Air Force's McChord Air Force Base which merged on 1 February 2010 into a Joint Base as a result of Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommendations of 2005. Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord is a training and mobilization center for all services and is the only Army power projection base west of the Rocky Mountains in the Continental United States. Its geographic location provides rapid access to the deep water ports of Tacoma, Olympia, and Seattle for deploying equipment. Units can be deployed from McChord Field, and individuals and small groups can also use nearby Sea- Tac Airport. The strategic location of the base provides Air Force units with the ability to conduct combat and humanitarian airlift with the C-17 Globemaster III.Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord website  History  = Fort Lewis = In 1916, a combination of local civilian businessmen seeking the creation of a military base in the Puget Sound area and a military survey team approved a military post to be constructed near American Lake. Businessmen and Washington voters approved a donation of the land near American Lake to the United States government. The base (then known as Camp Lewis) would serve as a vital training base for United States soldiers during World War I. This base would be known as one of the most well managed and cheaply funded bases that was constructed during World War I. Additional construction of the camp would officially commemorate a renaming of Camp Lewis to Fort Lewis in 1927. The construction of the base also included the seizure of Nisqually tribe reservation lands for their use as an artillery field. Legal seizure of the lands occurred through eminent domain and seizure, which resulted in tribal members being forced from their homes. Units trained at Fort Lewis would serve with major distinction in both the Pacific and European theaters during World War II. Prisoner of war compounds were constructed to house German and Italian POWs until the end of the war. Fort Lewis units also participated in major operations in the modern day, including Operation Just Cause and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. = McChord Air Force Base = McChord Air Force Base was originally named Tacoma Field in 1927 when a local voting measure voted to create a municipal airport. This airport would be purchased by the United States government in 1938 and renamed to McChord Field in May 1938 in honor of Colonel William McChord, who had died in an aircraft accident in Virginia. The early work and construction of the base prior to the start of World War II occurred under the Works Projects Administration. McChord Field served as a critical piece of defense infrastructure during World War II, training bomber aircraft pilots who would participate in the allied invasion of Italy, southern France, and the Doolittle Raid. McChord Field became McChord Air Force Base in 1948 with the formation of the United States Air Force as a separate division of the armed forces from the United States Army. McChord Air Force Base served as an airlift base since the end of World War II. The base functions as a strategic airlift base participating in transport (such as in Operation Desert Shield), humanitarian (such as relief during 1992 typhoons, support during the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, and support to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina), and air defense roles (such as military interception in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks). Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base officially joined to form Joint Base Lewis McChord in 2010 following the apolitical Base Realignment and Closure Commissions recommendations in 2005.  Geography and environment  The large protected lands available to military reservations makes environmental protection significantly important worldwide. Both formerly named Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base lands have been used as areas to conduct significant environmental studies. The use of military equipment on the base reservation contains the potential to damage environmental habitats. United States military facilities have implemented and continue to implement practices that include environmental preservation and protections. Joint Base Headquarters The Joint Base Headquarters (JBHQ) operates the installation in support of the warfighting units, their families and the extended military community. The mission of the JBHQ is to provide support to mission commanders and the joint base community, to serve as an enabler to the soldiers as they train and project America's combat power, and to make JBLM the station of choice for American soldiers and their families. With an Army joint base commander and an Air Force deputy joint base commander, the JBHQ supports the installation through directorates and agencies that provide a full range of city services and quality-of-life functions; everything from facilities maintenance, recreation and family programs to training support and emergency services. The major organizations that make up the bulk of the JBHQ include: * Directorates of Public Works: Logistics * Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation * Human Resources; Emergency Services * Directorate of Plans, Training, Mobilization, and Security (DPTMS) Additional staff offices that support the installation mission include the Joint Base Public Affairs Office, the Religious Support Office, the Resource Management Office, Equal Employment Opportunity Office, the Joint Base Safety Office and the Plans, Analysis and Integration Office. Other partners who work closely with the JBHQ include the Civilian Personnel Advisory Center, the Mission and Installation Contracting Command and Joint Personal Property Shipping Office. Two military units support the JBHQ * 627th Air Base Group : Provides command and control and administrative oversight to the Airmen who perform installation support duties on behalf of the Joint Base Commander. * Headquarters and Headquarters Company, JBLM : Provides administrative oversight to the Army personnel in the JBHQ and supports newly arrived soldiers during their in-processing period. JBLM Service Members receive medical care through on-base facilities such as Madigan Army Medical Center, the Okubo Clinic, the Nisqually Clinic, and the McChord Clinic. In 2010, Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord was called the U.S. military's \\"most troubled base\\" in 2010 by Stars and Stripes newspaper. By 2015, the base had changed its public image, winning recognition in the Army Communities of Excellence awards program with a Silver Award in 2012, and Bronze Awards in 2013 and 2014. =JBLM overview= JBLM has two Senior Service Component Commanders, one Army (Commander, I Corps) and one Air Force (Commander, 62d Airlift Wing), and has more than 45,000 service members and civilian workers. The post supports over 120,000 military retirees and more than 29,000 family members living both on and off post. The base has a total active population of nearly 210,000 inhabitants, making it the fourth largest military installment worldwide by population. JBLM consists of four geographical areas, Lewis Main, Lewis North, McChord Field, and Yakima Training Center. Lewis Main, Lewis North and McChord Field cover over ; while Yakima Training Center covers . JBLM Lewis Main, Lewis North and McChord Field have abundant high-quality, close-in training areas, including 115 live fire ranges. Additional training space is available at Yakima Training Center in eastern Washington, including maneuver areas and additional live fire ranges. In 2009, the former Fort Lewis Regional Correction Facility was remodeled and renamed the Northwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility (NWJRCF). The facility houses minimum and medium security prisoners from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.Retrieved from http://www.nwguardian.com/103/story/5626.html Northwest Guardian. JBLM Lewis North hosted the Leader Development and Assessment Course, a capstone program for the U.S. Army's ROTC program until it was relocated to Fort Knox, KY in 2014. Camp Murray (Washington National Guard) is adjacent to the post.
