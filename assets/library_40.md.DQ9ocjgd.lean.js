Saarinen is best known for designing the Washington Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C., the TWA Flight Center in New York City, and the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the son of noted Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen. Early life and education Eero Saarinen was born on August 20, 1910, to Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen and his second wife, Louise, on his father's 37th birthday. They immigrated to the United States in 1923, when Eero was thirteen. He grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where his father taught and was dean of the Cranbrook Academy of Art, and he took courses in sculpture and furniture design there. He had a close relationship with fellow students Charles and Ray Eames, and became good friends with Florence Knoll (n√©e Schust). Saarinen began studies in sculpture at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, France, in September 1929. He then went on to study at the Yale School of Architecture, completing his studies in 1934. Subsequently, he toured Europe for two years and returned to the United States in 1936 to work in his father's architectural practice. In 1940 Saarinen became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Architectural career Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri After his tour of Europe and North Africa, Saarinen returned to Cranbrook to work for his father and teach at the academy. His father's firm was Saarinen, Swansen and Associates, headed by Eliel Saarinen and Robert Swansen from the late 1930s until Eliel's death in 1950. The firm was located in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, until 1961 when the practice was moved to Hamden, Connecticut. Saarinen first received critical recognition while still working for his father, for a chair designed together with Charles Eames for the Organic Design in Home Furnishings competition in 1940, for which they received first prize. The Tulip chair, like all other Saarinen chairs, was taken into production by the Knoll furniture company, founded by Hans Knoll, who married Saarinen family friend Florence (Schust) Knoll. Further attention came also while Saarinen was still working for his father when he took first prize in the 1948 competition for the design of the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis. The memorial wasn't completed until the 1960s. The competition award was mistakenly sent to his father because both he and his father had entered the competition separately. When the committee sent out the letter stating Saarinen had won the competition, it was mistakenly addressed to his father. Washington Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. Kleinhans Music Hall in Symphony Circle, Buffalo, New York During his long association with Knoll he designed many important pieces of furniture, including the Grasshopper lounge chair and ottoman (1946), the Womb chair and ottoman (1948), the Womb settee (1950), side and arm chairs (1948‚Äì1950), and his most famous Tulip or Pedestal group (1956), which featured side and arm chairs, dining, coffee and side tables, as well as a stool. All of these designs were highly successful except for the Grasshopper lounge chair, which, although in production through 1965, was not a big success. TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport One of Saarinen's earliest works to receive international acclaim is the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois (1940). The first major work by Saarinen, in collaboration with his father, was the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, which follows the rationalist design Miesian style, incorporating steel and glass but with the addition of accent of panels in two shades of blue. The GM Technical Center was constructed in 1956, with Saarinen using models, which allowed him to share his ideas with others and gather input from other professionals. With the success of this project, Saarinen was then invited by other major American corporations such as John Deere, IBM, and CBS to design their new headquarters or other major corporate buildings. Despite the overall rational design philosophy, the interiors usually contained dramatic sweeping staircases as well as furniture designed by Saarinen, such as the Pedestal series. In the 1950s he began to receive more commissions from American universities for campus designs and individual buildings. These include the Noyes dormitory at Vassar and Hill College House at the University of Pennsylvania as well as the Ingalls ice rink, Ezra Stiles & Morse Colleges at Yale University, the MIT Chapel and neighboring Kresge Auditorium at MIT and the University of Chicago Law School building and grounds. Saarinen served on the jury for the Sydney Opera House commission in 1957 and was crucial in the selection of the now internationally known design by J√∏rn Utzon.Sydney Opera House History 1954‚Äì1958 A jury which did not include Saarinen had discarded Utzon's design in the first round; Saarinen reviewed the discarded designs, recognized a quality in Utzon's design, and ultimately assured the commission of Utzon. After his father's death in July 1950, Saarinen founded his own architect's office, Eero Saarinen and Associates. He was the principal partner from 1950 until his death. The firm carried out many of its most important works, including the Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in Holmdel Township, New Jersey; Gateway Arch National Park (including the Gateway Arch) in St. Louis, Missouri; the Miller House in Columbus, Indiana; the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which he worked on with Charles J. Parise; the main terminal of Washington Dulles International Airport; and the new East Air Terminal of the old Athens airport in Greece, which opened in 1967. Many of these projects use catenary curves in their structural designs. In 1949‚Äì50, Saarinen was hired by the then-new Brandeis University to create a master plan for the campus. Saarinen's plan A Foundation for Learning: Planning the Campus of Brandeis University (1949; second edition 1951), developed with Matthew Nowicki, called for a central academic complex surrounded by residential quadrangles along a peripheral road. The plan was never built but was useful in attracting donors. Saarinen did build a few residential structures on the campus, including Ridgewood Quadrangle (1950), Sherman Student Center (1952) and Shapiro Dormitory at Hamilton Quadrangle (1952). These have all been either demolished or extensively remodeled. One of his best-known thin-shell concrete structures in America is the Kresge Auditorium at MIT. Another thin- shell structure is Yale's Ingalls Rink, which has suspension cables connected to a single concrete backbone and is nicknamed \\"the whale\\". His most famous work is the TWA Flight Center, which represents the culmination of his previous designs and his genius for expressing the ultimate purpose of each building, what he called the \\"style for the job.\\" In 2019 the terminal was transformed into the TWA Hotel. Saarinen designed the Kleinhans Music Hall in Buffalo, New York, together with his father, Eliel Saarinen. He also designed the Embassy of the United States in London, which opened in 1960, and the Embassy of the United States in Oslo. Saarinen worked with his father, mother, and sister designing elements of the Cranbrook campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, including the Cranbrook School, Kingswood School, the Cranbrook Art Academy, and the Cranbrook Science Institute. Eero Saarinen's leaded-glass designs are a prominent feature of these buildings throughout the campus. Non-architectural activities Tulip chair and seat cushion, designed 1956, Brooklyn Museum Womb Chair, Model No. 70, designed 1947‚Äì1948, Brooklyn Museum Saarinen was recruited by Donal McLaughlin, an architectural school friend from his Yale days, to join the military service in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Saarinen was assigned to draw illustrations for bomb disassembly manuals and to provide designs for the Situation Room in the White House. Saarinen worked full-time for the OSS until 1944. Honors and awards Eero Saarinen was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1952. He was elected a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1954. In 1962, he was posthumously awarded a gold medal by the American Institute of Architects. In 1940, he received two first prizes together with Charles Eames in the furniture design competition of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1948, he won the first prize in the Jefferson National Monument competition. The Boston Arts festival in 1953 gave him their Grand Architectural Award. He received the First Honor award of the American Institute of Architects twice, in 1955 and 1956, and their gold medal in 1962. In 1965 he took first prize in US Embassy competition in London. Personal life Saarinen became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1940. Saarinen married sculptor Lilian Swann in 1939, with whom he had two children, Eric and Susan. The marriage ended in divorce in 1954. That same year Saarinen married Aline Bernstein Louchheim, an art critic at The New York Times, with whom he had a son, Eames, named after Saarinen's collaborator Charles Eames. Death Saarinen died on September 1, 1961, at the age of 51 while undergoing an operation for a brain tumor. He was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, overseeing the completion of a new music building for the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance. He is buried at White Chapel Memorial Cemetery, in Troy, Michigan.Entry for Eero Saarinen on Find a Grave Legacy Saarinen is now considered one of the masters of American 20th- century architecture. There has been a surge of interest in Saarinen's work in recent years, including a major exhibition and several books. This is partly because the Roche and Dinkeloo office has donated its Saarinen archives to Yale University, but also because Saarinen's oeuvre can be said to fit in with present-day concerns about pluralism of styles. He was criticized in his own time‚Äîmost vociferously by Yale's Vincent Scully‚Äîfor having no identifiable style; one explanation for this is that Saarinen's vision was adapted to each individual client and project, which were never exactly the same. The papers of Aline and Eero Saarinen, from 1906 to 1977, were donated in 1973 to the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution (by Charles Alan, Aline Saarinen's brother and executor of her estate). In 2006, the bulk of these primary source documents on the couple were digitized and posted online on the Archives' website. The Eero Saarinen collection at the Canadian Centre for Architecture documents eight built projects, including the old Athens airport in Greece, the former US Embassy Chanceries in Oslo, Norway and London, England, corporate projects for John Deere, CBS, and IBM, and the North Christian Church in Columbus, Indiana. An exhibition of Saarinen's work, Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future, was organized by the Finnish Cultural Institute in New York in collaboration with Yale School of Architecture, the National Building Museum, and the Museum of Finnish Architecture. The exhibition toured in Europe and the United States from 2006 to 2010, including a stint at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC. The exhibition was accompanied by the book Eero Saarinen: Shaping the Future. In 2016 Eero Saarinen: The Architect Who Saw the Future, a film about Saarinen (co-produced by his son Eric), premiered on the PBS American Masters series.About the Film - Eero Saarinen: The Architect Who Saw the Future American Masters PBS See also * List of works by Eero Saarinen * Tensile architecture * Thin-shell structure References Sources  Episode featuring the Cranbrook House and Gardens.    * External links * Commercial furniture sales blog mentioning the Womb chair. * Saarinen, Eero (1910‚Äì1961).

Clad in stainless steel and built in the form of a weighted catenary arch, it is the world's tallest arch, the tallest man-made monument in the Western Hemisphere, and Missouri's tallest accessible building. Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States, and officially dedicated to \\"the American people,\\" the Arch, commonly referred to as \\"The Gateway to the West\\" is the centerpiece of Gateway Arch National Park and has become an internationally recognized symbol of St. Louis, as well as a popular tourist destination. The Arch was designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen in 1947; construction began on February 12, 1963 and was completed on October 28, 1965 at an overall cost of $13 million (equivalent to $ in 2018). The monument opened to the public on June 10, 1967. It is located at the site of St. Louis's founding on the west bank of the Mississippi River. Historical background =Inception and funding (1933‚Äì1935)= Around late 1933, civic leader Luther Ely Smith, returning to St. Louis from the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park in Vincennes, Indiana, saw the St. Louis riverfront area and envisioned that building a memorial there would both revive the riverfront and stimulate the economy Archived from the original on February 14, 2011. Retrieved February 14, 2011. He communicated his idea to mayor Bernard Dickmann, who on December 15, 1933, raised it in a meeting with city leaders. They sanctioned the proposal, and the nonprofit Jefferson National Expansion Memorial Association (JNEMA‚Äîpronounced \\"Jenny May\\") was formed. Smith was appointed chairman and Dickmann vice chairman. The association's goal was to create: Many locals did not approve of depleting public funds for the cause. Smith's daughter SaLees related that when \\"people would tell him we needed more practical things\\", he would respond that \\"spiritual things\\" were equally important. The association expected that $30 million would be needed to undertake the construction of such a monument. It called upon the federal government to foot three-quarters of the bill ($22.5 million). The St. Louis riverfront after demolition The suggestion to renew the riverfront was not original, as previous projects were attempted but lacked popularity. The Jefferson memorial idea emerged amid the economic disarray of the Great Depression and promised new jobs. The project was expected to create 5,000 jobs for three to four years. Committee members began to raise public awareness by organizing fundraisers and writing pamphlets. They also engaged Congress by planning budgets and preparing bills, in addition to researching ownership of the land they had chosen, \\"approximately one-half mile in length ... from Third Street east to the present elevated railroad.\\" In January 1934, Senator Bennett Champ Clark and Representative John Cochran introduced to Congress an appropriation bill seeking $30 million for the memorial, but the bill failed to garner support due to the large amount of money solicited. In March of the same year, joint resolutions proposed the establishment of a federal commission to develop the memorial. Although the proposal aimed for only authorization, the bill incurred opposition because people suspected that JNEMA would later seek appropriation. On March 28 the Senate bill was reported out, and on April 5 it was turned over to the House Library Committee, which later reported favorably on the bills. On June 8, both the Senate and House bills were passed. On June 15, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill into law, instituting the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission. The commission comprised 15 members, chosen by Roosevelt, the House, the Senate, and JNEMA. It first convened on December 19 in St. Louis, where members examined the project and its planned location. Meanwhile, in December, the JNEMA discussed organizing an architectural competition to determine the design of the monument. Local architect Louis LeBeaume had drawn up competition guidelines by January 1935. On April 13, 1935, the commission certified JNEMA's project proposals, including memorial perimeters, the \\"historical significance\\" of the memorial, the competition, and the $30 million budget. Between February and April, the Missouri State Legislature passed an act allowing the use of bonds to facilitate the project. On April 15, then Governor Guy B. Park signed it into law. Dickmann and Smith applied for funding from two New Deal agencies‚Äîthe Public Works Administration (headed by Harold Ickes) and the Works Progress Administration (headed by Harry Hopkins). On August 7, both Ickes and Hopkins assented to the funding requests, each promising $10 million, and said that the National Park Service (NPS) would manage the memorial. A local bond issue election granting $7.5 million for the memorial's development was held on September 10 and passed. On December 21, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 7253 to approve the memorial, allocating the 82-acre area as the first National Historic Site. The order also appropriated $3.3 million through the WPA and $3.45 million through the PWA ($6.75 million in total). The motivation of the project was two- fold‚Äîcommemorating westward expansion and creating jobs. Some taxpayers began to file suits to block the construction of the monument, which they called a \\"boondoggle\\". =Initial planning (1936‚Äì1939)= Using the 1935 grant of $6.75 million and $2.25 million in city bonds, the NPS acquired the buildings within the historic site‚Äîthrough condemnation rather than purchase‚Äîand demolished them. By September 1938, condemnation was complete. The condemnation was subject to many legal disputes which culminated on January 27, 1939, when the United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that condemnation was valid. A total of $6.2 million was distributed to land owners on June 14. Demolition commenced on October 9, 1939, when Dickmann extracted three bricks from a vacant warehouse. Led by Paul Peters, adversaries of the memorial delivered to Congress a leaflet titled \\"Public Necessity or Just Plain Pork\\". The JNEMA's lawyer, Bon Geaslin, believed that the flyers did not taint the project, but motivated members of Congress to find out more about the same. Although Representative John Cochran wanted to ask Congress to approve more funds, Geaslin believed the association should \\"keep a low profile, maintaining its current position during this session of Congress\\". He advised the association to \\"get a good strong editorial in one of the papers to the effect that a small group of tenants ... is soliciting funds [to fight] the proposed improvement, and stating that these efforts do not represent the consensus of opinion in St. Louis ... , and pointing out that such obstructions should be condemned\\". Congress's reduction in spending made it impossible for the allocated funds to be obtained. NPS responded that the city would reduce its contribution if the federal government did. It also asserted that the funds were sanctioned by an executive order, but superintendent John Nagle pointed out that what \\"one Executive Order does, another can undo\\". In March 1936, Representative Cochran commented during a House meeting that he \\"would not vote for any measure providing for building the memorial or allotting funds to it\\". Geaslin found Cochran's statements to be a greater hindrance to the project than Paul Peters' opposition, for Congress might have Cochran's opinions as representative of public opinion. Peters and other opponents asked Roosevelt to rescind Executive Order 7253 and to redirect the money to the American Red Cross. Smith impugned their motives, accusing them of being \\"opposed to anything that is ever advanced in behalf of the city.\\" In February 1936, an editorial written by Paul W. Ward in The Nation denounced the project. Smith was infuriated, fearing the impact of attacks from a prestigious magazine, and wanted \\"to jump on it strong with hammer and tongs\\". William Allen White, a renowned newspaper editor, advised Smith not to fret. Because the Mississippi River played an essential role in establishing St. Louis's identity as the gateway to the west, a memorial commemorating it should be near the river. Railroad tracks that had been constructed in the 1930s on the levee obstructed views of the riverfront from the memorial site. When Ickes declared that the railway must be removed before he would allocate funds for the memorial, Archived from the original on February 25, 2011. Retrieved February 25, 2011. President of the St. Louis Board of Public Service Baxter Brown suggested that \\"a new tunnel ... conceal the relocated tracks and re-grading of the site to elevate it over the tunnel. These modifications would eliminate the elevated and surface tracks and open up the views to the river.\\" Although rejected by NPS architect Charles Peterson, Brown's proposal formed the basis for the ultimate settlement. =Design competition (1945‚Äì1948)= In November 1944, Smith discussed with Newton Drury, the National Park Service Director, the design of the memorial, asserting that the memorial should be \\"transcending in spiritual and aesthetic values\\", best represented by \\"one central feature: a single shaft, a building, an arch, or something else that would symbolize American culture and civilization.\\" The idea of an architectural competition to determine the design of the memorial was favored at the JNEMA's inaugural meeting. They planned to award cash for the best design. In January 1945, the JNEMA officially announced a two-stage design competition that would cost $225,000 to organize. Smith and the JNEMA struggled to raise the funds, garnering only a third of the required total by June 1945. Then mayor Aloys Kaufmann feared that the lack of public support would lead officials to abandon hope in the project. The passage of a year brought little success, and Smith frantically underwrote the remaining $40,000 in May 1946. By June, Smith found others to assume portions of his underwriting, with $17,000 remaining under his sponsorship. In February 1947, the underwriters were compensated, and the fund stood over $231,199. Archived from the original on February 14, 2011. Retrieved February 14, 2011. Local architect Louis LaBeaume prepared a set of specifications for the design, and architect George Howe was chosen to coordinate the competition. On May 30, 1947, the contest officially opened. The seven-member jury that would judge the designs comprised Charles Nagel Jr., Richard Neutra, Roland Wank, William Wurster, LaBeaume, Fiske Kimball, and S. Herbert Hare. The competition comprised two stages‚Äîthe first to narrow down the designers to five and the second to single out one architect and his design. The design intended to include: Saarinen working with a model of the arch in 1957 Saarinen's team included himself as designer, J. Henderson Barr as associate designer, and Dan Kiley as landscape architect, as well as Lily Swann Saarinen as sculptor and Alexander Girard as painter. In the first stage of the competition, Carl Milles advised Saarinen to change the bases of each leg to triangles instead of squares. Saarinen said that he \\"worked at first with mathematical shapes, but finally adjusted it according to the eye.\\" At submission, Saarinen's plans laid out the arch at tall and wide from center to center of the triangle bases. On September 1, 1947, submissions for the first stage were received by the jury. The submissions were labeled by numbers only, and the names of the designers were kept anonymous. Upon four days of deliberation, the jury narrowed down the 172 submissions, which included Saarinen's father Eliel, to five finalists, and announced the corresponding numbers to the media on September 27. Eero Saarinen's design (#144) was among the finalists, and comments written on it included \\"relevant, beautiful, perhaps inspired would be the right word\\" (Roland Wank) and \\"an abstract form peculiarly happy in its symbolism\\" (Charles Nagel). Hare questioned the feasibility of the design but appreciated the thoughtfulness behind it. Local St. Louis architect Harris Armstrong was also one of the finalists. The secretary who sent out the telegrams informing finalists of their advancement mistakenly sent one to Eliel rather than Eero. The family celebrated with champagne, and two hours later, a competition representative called to correct the mistake. Eliel \\"'broke out a second bottle of champagne' to toast his son.\\" They proceeded to the second stage, and each was given a $10,069 prize. Saarinen changed the height of the arch from 580 feet to He would also change the width of the arch to match its height. and wrote that the arch symbolized \\"the gateway to the West, the national expansion, and whatnot.\\" He wanted the landscape surrounding the arch to \\"be so densely covered with trees that it will be a forest-like park, a green retreat from the tension of the downtown city,\\" according to The New York Times architectural critic Aline Bernstein Louchheim. The deadline for the second stage arrived on February 10, 1948, and on February 18, the jury chose Saarinen's design unanimously, praising its \\"profoundly evocative and truly monumental expression.\\" The following day, during a formal dinner at Statler Hotel that the finalists and the media attended, Wurster pronounced Saarinen the winner of the competition and awarded the checks‚Äî$40,000 to his team and $50,000 to Saarinen. The competition was the first major architectural design that Saarinen developed unaided by his father. On May 25, the United States Territorial Expansion Memorial Commission endorsed the design. Later, in June, the NPS approved the proposal. Representative H. R. Gross, however, opposed the allocation of federal funds for the arch's development. The design drew varied responses. In a February 29, 1969, The New York Times article, Louchheim praised the arch's design as \\"a modern monument, fitting, beautiful and impressive.\\" Some local residents likened it to a \\"stupendous hairpin and a stainless steel hitching post.\\" The most aggressive criticism emerged from Gilmore D. Clarke, whose February 26, 1948, letter compared Saarinen's arch to an arch imagined by fascist Benito Mussolini, rendering the arch a fascist symbol. This allegation of plagiarism ignited fierce debates among architects about its validity. Douglas Haskell from New York wrote that \\"The use of a common form is not plagiarism ... [T]his particular accusation amounts to the filthiest smear that has been attempted by a man highly placed in the architectural profession in our generation.\\" Wurster and the jury refuted the charges, arguing that \\"the arch form was not inherently fascist but was indeed part of the entire history of architecture.\\" Saarinen considered the opposition absurd, asserting, \\"It's just preposterous to think that a basic form, based on a completely natural figure, should have any ideological connection.\\" By January 1951, Saarinen created 21 \\"drawings, including profiles of the Arch, scale drawings of the museums and restaurants, various parking proposals, the effect of the levee-tunnel railroad plan on the Arch footings, the Arch foundations, the Third Street Expressway, and the internal and external structure of the Arch.\\" Fred Severud made calculations for the arch's structure. =Railroad agreement (1949‚Äì1958)= Several proposals were offered for moving the railroad tracks, including: * Bates-Ross. Tracks would cross the memorial site diagonally in a tunnel. * Bowen. Similar to Bates-Ross proposal. * Hill- Tunnel. Supported by Saarinen and NPS engineer Julian Spotts, it would route the tracks in a tunnel below Second and First Streets. Saarinen further said that if the tracks passed between the memorial and the river, he would withdraw his participation. *La Beaume-Terminal. Opposed by Saarinen and the NPS, it would lay \\"three tracks on a contained fill along the lines of the elevated tracks.\\" * Levee-Tunnel. Proposed by Frank J. McDevitt, president of the St. Louis Board of Public Service, it would lower the tracks into a tunnel concealed by walls and landscaping. On July 7, 1949, in Mayor Joseph Darst's office, city officials chose the Levee-Tunnel plan, rousing JNEMA members who held that the decision had been pressed through when Smith was away on vacation. Darst notified Secretary of the Interior Julius Krug of the city's selection. Krug planned to meet with Smith and JNEM but canceled the meeting and resigned on November 11. His successor, Oscar L. Chapman, rescheduled the meeting for December 5 in Washington with delegates from the city government, JNEMA, railroad officials, and Federal government. A day after the conference, they ratified a memorandum of understanding about the plan: \\"The five tracks on the levee would be replaced by three tracks, one owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MPR) and two by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA) proceeding through a tunnel not longer than 3,000 feet. The tunnel would be approximately fifty feet west of the current elevated line.\\" It would also have an overhead clearance of , lower than the regular requirement of . Chapman approved the document on December 22, 1949, and JNEM garnered the approval of the Missouri Public Service Commission on August 7, 1952. Archived from the original on March 30, 2011. Retrieved March 30, 2011. Efforts to appropriate congressional funds began in January 1950 but were delayed until 1953 by the Korean War's depletion of federal funds. In August 1953, Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton declared that the Department of the Interior and the railroads should finalize the agreement on the new route. In October, NPS and the TRRA decided that the TRRA would employ a surveyor endorsed by Spotts \\"to survey, design, estimate, and report on\\" the expenses of shifting the tracks. They chose Alfred Benesch and Associates, which released its final report on May 3, 1957. The firm estimated that the two proposals would cost more than expected: more than $11 million and $14 million, respectively. NPS director Conrad Wirth enjoined Saarinen to make small modifications to the design. In October, Saarinen redrafted the plans, suggesting: Archived from the original on April 4, 2011. Retrieved April 4, 2011. On November 29, involved interests signed another memorandum of understanding approving Saarinen's rework; implementing it would cost about $5.053 million. On March 10, 1959, mayor Raymond Tucker proposed that they drop \\"the tunnel idea in favor of open cuts roofed with concrete slabs,\\" which would cost $2.684 million, $1.5 million less than the cost of the approved plan. On May 12, 1958, Tucker, TRRA president Armstrong Chinn, and Missouri Pacific Railroad president Russell Dearmont entered a written agreement: \\"The TRRA would place $500,000 in escrow for the project, and the city [would] sell $980,000 of the 1935 bonds to match the Federal contribution.\\" Director Wirth and Secretary Seaton approved the plan on June 2. In July 1953, Representative Leonor Sullivan introduced H.R. 6549, a bill authorizing the allocation of no more than $5 million to build the arch. After much negotiation, both houses of Congress approved the bill in May 1954, and on May 18, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law as Public Law 361. Congress could not afford to appropriate the funds in 1955, so association president William Crowdus resorted to asking the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations for $10 million. The foundations denied the request because their function as private foundations did not include funding national memorials. In 1956, Congress appropriated $2.64 million to be used to move the railroad tracks. The remainder of the authorized appropriation was requested via six congressional bills, introduced on July 1, 1958, that revised Public Law 361 to encompass the cost of the entire memorial, increasing federal funds by $12.25 million. A month later the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of the Budget endorsed the bill, and both houses of Congress unanimously passed the bill. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 7. The NPS held off on appropriating the additional funds, as it planned to use the already- appropriated funds to initiate the railroad work. =Final preparations (1959‚Äì1968)= 3-D model of the Arch Saarinen and city functionaries collaborated to zone buildings near the arch. In April 1959, real estate developer Lewis Kitchen decided to construct two 40-level edifices across from the arch. In July, after the plan was condemned for its potential obstruction of the arch, Kitchen discussed the issue with officials. A decision was delayed for several months because Saarinen had yet to designate the arch's height, projected between . By October, Mayor Tucker and Director Wirth resolved to restrict the height of buildings opposite the arch to (about 27 levels), and the city stated that plans for buildings opposite the arch would require its endorsement. Kitchen then decreased the height of his buildings, while Saarinen increased that of the arch. Archived from the original on May 15, 2011. Retrieved May 15, 2011. Moving the railroad tracks was the first stage of the project. On May 6, 1959, after an official conference, the Public Service Commission called for ventilation to accompany the tunnel's construction, which entailed \\"placing 3,000 feet of dual tracks into a tunnel 105 feet west of the elevated railroad, along with filling, grading, and trestle work.\\" Eight bids for the work were reviewed on June 8 in the Old Courthouse, and the MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis won with a bid of $2,426,115, less than NPS's estimate of the cost. At 10:30 a.m. on June 23, 1959, the groundbreaking ceremony occurred; Tucker spaded the first portion of earth. Wirth and Dickmann delivered speeches. The NPS acquired the $500,000 in escrow and transferred it to MacDonald to begin building the new tracks. In August, demolition of the Old Rock House was complete, with workers beginning to excavate the tunnel. In November, they began shaping the tunnel's walls with concrete. Twenty-nine percent of the construction was completed by March and 95% by November. On November 17, trains began to use the new tracks. June 1962 was the projected date of fruition. On May 16, 1959, the Senate appropriations subcommittee received from St. Louis legislators a request for $2.4911 million, of which it granted only $133,000. Wirth recommended that they reseek the funds in January 1960. On March 10, 1959, Regional Director Howard Baker received $888,000 as the city's first subsidy for the project. On December 1, 1961, $23,003,150 in total had been authorized, with $19,657,483 already appropriated‚Äî$3,345,667 remained not yet appropriated. Construction The bidding date, originally December 20, 1961, was postponed to January 22, 1962, to clarify the details of the arch construction. About 50 companies that had requested the construction requirements received bidding invitations. Extending from $11,923,163 to $12,765,078, all four bids exceeded the engineer estimate of $8,067,000. Wirth had a committee led by George Hartzog determine the validity of the bids in light of the government's conditions. Following a meeting with the bidders, the committee affirmed the bids' reasonableness, and Wirth awarded the lowest bidder, MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis, the contract for the construction of the arch and the visitor center. On March 14, 1962, he signed the contract and received from Tucker $2.5 million, the city's subsidy for the phase. MacDonald reduced its bid $500,000 to $11,442,418. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company served as the subcontractor for the shell of the arch. In 1959 and 1960, ground was broken, and in 1961, the foundation of the structure was laid. Construction of the arch itself began on February 12, 1963, as the first steel triangle on the south leg was eased into place. These steel triangles, which narrowed as they spiraled to the top, were raised into place by a group of cranes and derricks. The arch was assembled of 142 prefabricated stainless steel sections. Once in place, each section had its double-walled skin filled with concrete, prestressed with 252 tension bars. In order to keep the partially completed legs steady, a scissors truss was placed between them at , later removed as the derricks were taken down. The whole endeavor was expected to be completed by fall 1964, in observance of St. Louis's bicentennial. Contractor MacDonald Construction Co. arranged a tower for spectators and provided recorded accounts of the undertaking. In 1963, a million people went to observe the progress, and by 1964, local radio stations began to broadcast when large slabs of steel were to be raised into place. St. Louis Post- Dispatch photographer Art Witman documented the construction for the newspaper's Sunday supplement Pictures, his longest and most noted assignment. He visited the construction site frequently from 1963 to 1967 recording of every stage of progress. With assistant Renyold Ferguson, he crawled along the catwalks with the construction workers up to 190m above the ground.Gilbert Bailon. (2015). Book and special section commemorate 50 years of the Gateway Arch. St. Louis Post-Dispatch (St. Louis, MO), pp. St. Louis Post-Dispatch (St. Louis, MO), Oct 25, 2015. He was the only news photographer on permanent assignment at the construction, with complete access. He primarily worked with slide film, but also used the only Panox camera in St. Louis to create panoramic photographs covering 140 degrees. Witman's pictures of the construction are now housed in the State Historical Society of Missouri. The project manager of MacDonald Construction Co., Stan Wolf, said that a 62-story building was easier to build than the arch: \\"In a building, everything is straight up, one thing on top of another. In this arch, everything is curved.\\" =Delays and lawsuits= Arch construction in June 1965. Although an actuarial firm predicted thirteen workers would die while building the arch, no workers were killed during the monument's construction. However, construction of the arch was still often delayed by safety checks, funding uncertainties, and legal disputes. Civil rights activists regarded the construction of the arch as a token of racial discrimination. On July 14, 1964, during the workers' lunchtime, civil rights protesters Percy Green and Richard Daly, both members of Congress of Racial Equality, climbed 125 feet up the north leg of the arch to \\"expose the fact that federal funds were being used to build a national monument that was racially discriminating against black contractors and skilled black workers.\\" As the pair disregarded demands to get off, protesters on the ground demanded that at least 10% of the skilled jobs belong to African Americans. Four hours later Green and Daly dismounted from the arch, to charges of \\"trespassing, peace disturbance, and resisting arrest.\\" This incident inter alia spurred the United States Department of Justice to file the first pattern or practice case against AFL‚ÄìCIO under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on February 4, 1966, but the department later called off the charges. The 1966 lawsuit was an attempt by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) to desegregate building-trade unions nationwide. Many technical building unions had little or no African-American representation into the mid-1960s. During Lyndon Johnson's presidency, the federal government recognized the need for more integration in all levels of society and started enforcing equal employment opportunity through federally funded job contracts. In 1964, the Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company of Warren, Pennsylvania sued MacDonald for $665,317 for tax concerns. In 1965, NPS requested that Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel remove the prominent letters \\"P-D-M\\" (its initials) from a creeper derrick used for construction, contending that it was promotional and violated federal law with regards to advertising on national monuments. Although Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel initially refused to pursue what it considered a precarious venture, the company relented after discovering that leaving the initials would cost $225,000 and after that, $42,000 per month, and the NPS dropped its lawsuit. On October 26, 1965, the International Association of Ironworkers delayed work to ascertain that the arch was safe. After NPS director Kenneth Chapman gave his word that conditions were \\"perfectly safe,\\" construction resumed on October 27. After the discovery of 16 defects, the tram was also delayed from running. The Bi-State Development Agency assessed that it suffered losses of $2,000 for each day the trains were stagnant. On January 7, 1966, members of AFL‚ÄìCIO deserted their work on the visitor center, refusing to work with plumbers affiliated with Congress of Industrial Unions (CIU), which represented black plumbers. A representative of AFL‚ÄìCIO said, \\"This policy has nothing to do with race. Our experience is that these CIU members have in the past worked for substandard wages.\\" CIU applied to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for an injunction that required the AFL‚ÄìCIO laborers to return to work. On February 7, Judge John Keating Regan ruled that AFL‚ÄìCIO workers had participated in a secondary boycott. By February 11, AFL‚ÄìCIO resumed work on the arch, and an AFL‚ÄìCIO contractor declared that ten African Americans were apprenticed for arch labor. The standstill in work lasted a month. Considering how large Federal projects often \\"go haywire\\", Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said, \\"This memorial will be like a cathedral; built slowly but surely.\\" =Topping out and dedication= The dedication plaque President Lyndon B. Johnson and Mayor Alfonso J. Cervantes decided on a date for the topping out ceremony, but the arch had not been completed by then. The ceremony date was reset to October 17, 1965, and workers strained to meet the deadline, taking double shifts, but by October 17, the arch was still not complete. The chairman of the ceremony anticipated the ceremony to be held on October 30, a Saturday, to allow 1,500 schoolchildren, whose signatures were to be placed in a time capsule, to attend. Ultimately, PDM set the ceremony date to October 28. The time capsule, containing the signatures of 762,000 students and others, was welded into the keystone before the final piece was set in place. On October 28, the arch was topped out as then Vice President Hubert Humphrey observed from a helicopter. A Catholic priest and a rabbi prayed over the keystone, a , triangular section. It was slated to be inserted at 10:00 a.m. local time but was done 30 minutes early because thermal expansion had constricted the gap at the top by . To mitigate this, workers used fire hoses to spray water on the surface of the south leg to cool it down and make it contract. The keystone was inserted in 13 minutes with only remaining. For the next section, a hydraulic jack had to pry apart the legs . The last section was left only . By noon, the keystone was secured. Some filmmakers, in hope that the two legs would not meet, had chronicled every phase of construction. The Gateway Arch was expected to open to the public by 1964, but in 1967 the public relations agency stopped forecasting the opening date. The arch's visitor center opened on June 10, 1967, and the tram began operating on July 24. The arch was dedicated by Humphrey on May 25, 1968. He declared that the arch was \\"a soaring curve in the sky that links the rich heritage of yesterday with the richer future of tomorrow\\" and brings a \\"new purpose\\" and a \\"new sense of urgency to wipe out every slum.\\" \\"Whatever is shoddy, whatever is ugly, whatever is waste, whatever is false, will be measured and condemned\\" in comparison to the Gateway Arch. About 250,000 people were expected to attend, but rain canceled the outdoor activities. The ceremony had to be transferred into the visitor center. After the dedication, Humphrey crouched beneath an exit as he waited for the rain to subside so he could walk to his vehicle. =After completion= The project did not provide 5,000 jobs as expected‚Äîas of June 1964, workers numbered fewer than 100. The project did, however, incite other riverfront restoration efforts, totaling $150 million. Building projects included a 50,000-seat sports stadium, a 30-story hotel, several office towers, four parking garages, and an apartment complex. The idea of a Disneyland amusement park that included \\"synthetic riverboat attractions\\" was considered but later abandoned. The developers hoped to use the arch as a commercial catalyst, attracting visitors who would use their services. One estimate found that since the 1960s, the arch has incited almost $503 million worth of construction. In June 1976, the memorial was finalized by federal allocations‚Äî\\"the statue of Thomas Jefferson was unveiled, the Museum of Westward Expansion was previewed, a theater under the Arch was dedicated in honor of Mayor Raymond Tucker and the catenary-like curving staircases from the Arch down to the levee were built.\\" Characteristics =Physical characteristics= The windows of the observation deck are located around the apex of the arch. Both the width and height of the arch are . The arch is the tallest memorial in the United States and the tallest stainless steel monument in the world. The cross-sections of the arch's legs are equilateral triangles, narrowing from per side at the bases to per side at the top. Each wall consists of a stainless steel skin covering a sandwich of two carbon-steel walls with reinforced concrete in the middle from ground level to , with carbon steel to the peak. The arch is hollow to accommodate a unique tram system that takes visitors to an observation deck at the top. The structural load is supported by a stressed- skin design. Each leg is embedded in of concrete thick and deep. of the foundation is in bedrock. The arch is resistant to earthquakes and is designed to sway up to in either direction,http://www.gatewayarch.com/about/history/arch-faqs-facts.aspx while withstanding winds up to . The structure weighs , of which concrete composes ; structural steel interior, ; and the stainless steel panels that cover the exterior of the arch, . This amount of stainless steel is the most used in any one project in history. The base of each leg at ground level had to have an engineering tolerance of or the two legs would not meet at the top. =Mathematical elements= The arch is a weighted catenary‚Äîits legs are wider than its upper section. The geometric form of the structure was set by mathematical equations provided to Saarinen by Hannskarl Bandel. Bruce Detmers and other architects expressed the geometric form in blueprints with this equation: y = A \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\frac {Cx}{L}-1 \\\\right) \\\\quad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\quad x = \\\\frac {L}{C} \\\\cosh^{-1} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac {y}{A} \\\\right), with the constants A = \\\\frac {f_c} {Q_b/Q_t - 1} = 68.7672 C = \\\\cosh^{-1} \\\\frac {Q_b}{Q_t} = 3.0022 where fc = is the maximum height of centroid, Qb = is the maximum cross sectional area of arch at base, Qt = is the minimum cross sectional area of arch at top, and L = is the half width of centroid at the base. The triangular cross sectional area varies linearly with the vertical height of its centroid. This hyperbolic cosine function describes the shape of a catenary. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted catenary arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The catenary arch is the stablest of all arches since the thrust passes through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, instead of forcing the legs apart. The Gateway Arch itself is not a common catenary, but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted catenary. Saarinen chose a weighted catenary over a normal catenary curve because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, \\"This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve‚Äîthe curve of a hanging chain‚Äîa curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch.\\" William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling attention to the fact that the structure was a weighted catenary. =Lighting= The arch illuminated in pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month The arch's lighting system The first proposal to illuminate the arch at night was announced on May 18, 1966, but the plan never came to fruition. In July 1998, funding for an arch lighting system was approved by St. Louis's Gateway Foundation, which agreed to take responsibility for the cost of the equipment, its installation, and its upkeep. In January 1999, MSNBC arranged a temporary lighting system for the arch so the monument could be used as the background for a visit by Pope John Paul II. Since November 2001, the arch has been bathed in white light between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. via a system of floodlights. Designed by Randy Burkett, it comprises 44 lighting fixtures situated in four pits just below ground level. On October 5, 2004, the U.S. Senate, at the pressing of Senators Jim Talent and Kit Bond, approved a bill permitting the illumination in pink of the arch in honor of breast cancer awareness month. Both Estee Lauder and May Department Store Co. had championed the cause. One employee said that the arch would be a \\"beacon ... for the importance of prevention and finding a cure.\\" While the National Park Service took issue with the plan due to the precedent it would set for prospective uses of the arch, it yielded due to a realization that it and Congress were \\"on the same team\\" and because the illumination was legally obligatory; on October 25, the plan was carried out. The previous time the arch was illuminated for promotional purposes was on September 12, 1995, under the management of local companies Fleishman-Hillard and Technical Productions when a rainbow spectrum was shone on the arch to publicize the debut of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus' Wizard of Oz on Ice at the Scottrade Center (then named the \\"Kiel Center\\"). Public access Southern entrance to the subterranean visitor center In April 1965, three million tourists were expected to visit the arch after completion; 619,763 tourists visited the top of the arch in its first year open. On January 15, 1969, a visitor from Nashville, Tennessee, became the one-millionth person to reach the observation area; the ten-millionth person ascended to the top on August 24, 1979. In 1974, the arch was ranked fourth on a list of \\"most-visited man- made attraction[s]\\". The Gateway Arch is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world with over four million visitors annually, of which around one million travel to the top. The arch was listed as a National Historic Landmark on June 2, 1987, and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On December 8, 2009, sponsored by nonprofit CityArchRiver2015, the international design competition \\"Framing a Modern Masterpiece: The City + The Arch + The River 2015\\" commenced. It aimed to \\"design a plan to improve the riverfront park landscape, ease access for pedestrians across Memorial Drive and expand onto the East St. Louis riverfront,\\" as well as to attract visitors. The contest consisted of three stages‚Äîportfolio assessment (narrowed down to 8‚Äì10 teams), team interviews (narrowed down to 4‚Äì5 teams), and review of design proposals. The competition received 49 applicants, which were narrowed down to five in the first two stages. On August 17, 2010, the designs of the five finalists were revealed to the public and exhibited at the theater below the arch. On August 26, the finalists made their cases to an eight-member jury, and on September 21, the winner was revealed‚ÄîMichael Van Valkenburgh Associates. The initiative's plans include updating Kiener Plaza and the Old Courthouse, connecting the city to the Arch grounds with a park over Interstate 70, a re-imagined museum and improved accessibility. The budget for the project is $380 million and was set to be completed in 2018. Ground broke on the 'Park over the Highway' project, the first component of the CityArchRiver project, on August 2, 2013. This project features a landscaped structure over Interstate 70 and rerouted surface traffic that had previously formed a moat separating the Gateway Arch from the Old Courthouse.This project was completed in December 2014. =Visitor center= Inside the visitor center The underground visitor center for the arch was designed as part of the National Park Service's Mission 66 program. The center is located directly below the arch, between its legs. Although construction on the visitor center began at the same time as construction for the arch itself, it did not conclude until 1976 because of insufficient funding; however, the center opened with several exhibits on June 10, 1967. Access to the visitor center is provided through ramps adjacent to each leg of the arch. The center houses offices, mechanical rooms, and waiting areas for the arch trams, as well as its main attractions: the Museum of Westward Expansion and two theaters displaying films about the arch. The older theater opened in May 1972; the newer theater, called the Odyssey Theatre, was constructed in the 1990s and features a four-story-tall screen. Its construction required the expansion of the underground complex, and workers had to excavate solid rock while keeping the disruption to a minimum so the museum could remain open. The museum houses several hundred exhibits about the United States' westward expansion in the 19th century and opened on August 10, 1977. As part of the CityArchRiver project, the visitor center and museum underwent a $176 million expansion and renovation that was completed in July 2018. Once completed, the renovation will include a 46,000-square-foot underground addition featuring interactive story galleries, video walls, a fountain and a cafe. =Observation area= Observation area on top of the Gateway Arch Near the top of the Arch, passengers exit the tram compartment and climb a slight grade to enter the observation area. This arched deck, which is over long and wide, can hold up to about 160 people, equivalent to the number of people from four trams. Sixteen windows per side, each measuring , offer views up to to the east across the Mississippi River and southern Illinois with its prominent Mississippian culture mounds at Cahokia Mounds and to the west over the city of St. Louis and St. Louis County beyond. Modes of ascent Interior of the tram capsule in the Gateway Arch There are three modes of transportation up the arch: two sets of 1,076-step emergency stairs (one per leg), a 12-passenger elevator to the height, and a tram in each leg. Each tram is a chain of eight cylindrical, five-seat compartments with a small window on the doors. As each tram has a capacity of 40 passengers and there are two trams, 80 passengers can be transported at one time, with trams departing from the ground every 10 minutes. The cars swing like Ferris-wheel cars as they ascend and descend the arch. This fashion of movement gave rise to the idea of the tram as \\"half-Ferris wheel and half-elevator.\\" The trip to the top takes four minutes, and the trip down takes three minutes. North stairs and tram descending from observation platform Because of a lack of funds in March 1962, the NPS did not accept bids for the arch's internal train system and considered discarding the idea. In May 1962, the Bi-State Development Agency proposed that it issue revenue bonds to obtain the required funds. The Department of the Interior and Bi-State entered into an agreement where Bi-State would construct and operate the tram. Bi-State would have to raise $1,977,750 for the construction of the tram system. It retired the bonds by setting a $1 riding fee to the top. A view of the city of St. Louis from the observation room of the St. Louis Arch. Summer 2018. Bi-State put in $3.3 million revenue bonds and has operated the tram system since. The tram in the north leg entered operation in June 1967, but visitors were forced to endure three-hour-long waits until April 21, 1976, when a reservation system was put in place. The south tram was completed by March 1968. Commemorative pins were awarded to the first 100,000 passengers. As of 2007, the trams have traveled , conveying more than 25 million passengers. Incidents A young boy is looking out one of the observation windows at the city of St. Louis. Busch Stadium can be seen through the window. On July 8, 1970, a six-year-old boy, his mother, and two of her friends were trapped in a tram in the arch's south leg after the monument closed. According to the boy's mother, the group went up the arch around 9:30 p.m. CDT, but when the tram reached the de-boarding area, its doors did not open. The tram then reportedly traveled up to a storage area above the ground, and the power was switched off. One person was able to pry open the tram door and the four managed to reach a security guard for help after being trapped for about 45 minutes. On July 21, 2007, a broken cable forced the south tram to be shut down, leaving only the north tram in service until repairs were completed in March 2008. Around 200 tourists were stuck inside the arch for about three hours because the severed cable contacted a high-voltage rail, causing a fuse to blow. The north tram was temporarily affected by the power outage as well, but some passengers were able to exit the arch through the emergency stairs and elevator. It was about two hours until all the tram riders safely descended, while those in the observation area at the time of the outage had to wait an additional hour before being able to travel back down. An arch official said the visitors, most of whom stayed calm during the ordeal, were not in any danger and were later given refunds. The incident occurred while visitors in the arch were watching a fireworks display, and no one was seriously injured in the event. However, two people received medical treatment; one person needed oxygen and the other was diabetic. Almost immediately after the tram returned to service, however, it was closed again for new repairs after an electrical switch broke. The incident, which occurred on March 14, 2008, was billed as a \\"bad coincidence.\\" A view of the Mississippi River from the observation room of the St. Louis Arch. On the morning of February 9, 2011, a National Park Service worker was injured while performing repairs on the south tram. The 55-year-old was working on the tram's electrical system when he was trapped between it and the arch wall for around 30 seconds, until being saved by other workers. Emergency officials treated the injured NPS employee at the arch's top before taking him to Saint Louis University Hospital in a serious condition. On March 24, 2011, around one hundred visitors were stranded in the observation area for 45 minutes after the doors of the south tram refused to close. The tourists were safely brought down the arch in the north tram, which had been closed that week so officials could upgrade it with a new electronic transportation system. The National Park Service later attributed the malfunction to a computer glitch associated with the new system, which had already been implemented with the south tram. No one was hurt in the occurrence. Around 2:15 p.m. local time on June 16, 2011, the arch's north tram stalled due to a power outage. The tram became stuck about from the observation deck, and passengers eventually were told to climb the stairs to the observation area. It took National Park Service workers about one hour to manually pull the tram to the top, and the 40 trapped passengers were able to return down on the south tram, which had previously not been operating that day because there was not an abundance of visitors. An additional 120 people were at the observation deck at the time of the outage and also exited via the south tram. During the outage, visitors were stuck in the tram with neither lighting nor air conditioning. No one was seriously injured in the incident, but one visitor lost consciousness after suffering a panic attack, and a park ranger was taken away with minor injuries. The cause of the outage was not immediately known. =Stunts and accidents= The arch in September 2007 On June 16, 1965, the Federal Aviation Administration cautioned that aviators who flew through the arch would be fined and their licenses revoked. At least ten pilots have disobeyed this order, beginning on June 22, 1966. In 1973, Nikki Caplan was granted an FAA exception to fly a hot air balloon between the arch's legs as part of the Great Forest Park Balloon Race. During the flight, on which the St. Louis park director was a passenger, the balloon hit the arch and plummeted 70 feet before recovering. In 1976, a U.S. Army exhibition skydiving team was permitted to fly through the arch as part of Fourth of July festivities, and since then, numerous skydiving exhibition teams have legally jumped onto the Arch grounds, after having flown their parachutes through the legs of the Arch. The arch has been a target of various stunt performers, and while such feats are generally forbidden, several people have parachuted to or from the arch regardless. In June 1980, the National Park Service declined a request by television producers to have a performer jump from the arch; a similar appeal by stuntman Dan Koko was also turned away in February 1986. Koko, who was a stunt double for Superman, wanted to perform the leap during Fourth of July celebrations. In 2013 Alexander Polli, a European BASE jumper, planned to fly a wingsuit under the arch but had his demo postponed by the FAA. 1980 accident On November 22, 1980, at about 8:45 a.m. CST, 33-year-old Kenneth Swyers of Overland, Missouri, parachuted onto the top of the arch. His plan was to release his main parachute and then jump off the arch using his reserve parachute to perform a base jump. Unfortunately, after landing the wind blew him to the side, and he slid down the north leg to his death. The accident was witnessed by several people, including Swyers' wife, also a parachutist. She said her husband \\"was not a hot dog, daredevil skydiver\\" and that he had prepared for the jump two weeks in advance. Swyers, who had made over 1,600 jumps before the incident, was reported by one witness to have \\"landed very well\\" on the top of the arch, but \\"had no footing.\\" Swyers was reportedly blown to the top of the arch by the wind and was unable to save himself when his reserve parachute failed to deploy. The Federal Aviation Administration said the jump was unauthorized, and investigated the pilot involved in the incident. On December 27, 1980, St. Louis television station KTVI reported receiving calls from supposed witnesses of another stunt landing. The alleged parachutist, who claimed to be a retired professional stuntman, was said to be wearing a Santa Claus costume when he jumped off an airplane around 8:00 a.m. CST, parachuted onto the arch, grasped the monument's beacon, and used the same parachute to glide down unharmed. KTVI said it was told the feat was done as an act of homage to Swyers, and \\"apparently was a combination of a dare, a drunk, and a tribute.\\" On the day after the alleged incident, authorities declared the jump a hoax. A spokesperson for the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said no calls were received about the jump until after it was broadcast on the news, and the Federal Aviation Administration said the two calls it had received were very similar. One caller also left an out-of-service phone number, while the other never followed up with investigators. Arch officials said they did not witness any such jump, and photos provided by the alleged parachutist were unclear. 1992 stunt Aerial shot of the arch On September 14, 1992, 25-year-old John C. Vincent climbed to the top of the Gateway Arch using suction cups and proceeded to parachute back to the ground. He was later charged with two misdemeanors: climbing a national monument and parachuting in a national park. Federal prosecutor Stephen Higgins called the act a \\"great stunt\\" but said it was \\"something the Park Service doesn't take lightly.\\" Vincent, a construction worker and diver from Harvey, Louisiana, said he did it \\"just for the excitement, just for the thrill,\\" and had previously parachuted off the World Trade Center in May 1991. He said that scaling the arch \\"wasn't that hard\\" and had considered a jump off the monument for a few months. In an interview, Vincent said he visited the arch's observation area a month before the stunt, to see if he could use a maintenance hatch for accessing the monument's peak. Due to the heavy security, he instead decided to climb up the arch's exterior using suction cups, which he had used before to scale shorter buildings. Dressed in black, Vincent began crawling up the arch around 3:30 a.m. CST on September 14 and arrived undetected at the top around 5:45 a.m., taking an additional 75 minutes to rest and take photos before finally jumping. During this time, he was seen by two traffic reporters inside the One Metropolitan Square skyscraper. Vincent was also spotted mid-air by Deryl Stone, a Chief Ranger for the National Park Service. Stone reported seeing Vincent grab his parachute after landing and run to a nearby car, which quickly drove away. However, authorities were able to detain two men on the ground who had been videotaping the jump. Stone said 37-year-old Ronald Carroll and 27-year-old Robert Weinzetl, both St. Louis residents, were found with a wireless communication headset and a video camera, as well as a still camera with a telephoto lens. The two were also charged with two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and commercial photography in a national park. Vincent later turned himself in and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, he eventually accepted a guilty plea deal in which he testified against Carroll and Weinzetl, revealing that the two consented to recording the jump during a meeting of all three on the day before his stunt occurred. Federal magistrate judge David D. Noce ruled on January 28, 1993, that Carroll had been involved in a conspiracy and was guilty of both misdemeanor charges; the charges against Weinzetl had been dropped by federal attorneys. In his decision, Noce stated, \\"There are places in our country where the sufficiently skilled can savor the exhilaration and personal satisfaction of accomplishing courageous and intrepid acts, of reaching dreamed-of heights and for coursing dangerous adventures,\\" but added that other places are designed for \\"the exhilaration of mere observation and for the appreciation of the imaginings and the works of others. The St. Louis Arch and the grounds of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial are in the latter category.\\" After his guilty plea, Vincent was sentenced to a $1,000 fine, 25 hours of community service, and a year's probation. In December, 1992 Vincent was sentenced to ninety days in jail for violating his probation. =Security= Two years after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, a little over $1 million was granted to institute a counterterrorism program. Park officials were trained to note the activity of tourists, and inconspicuous electronic detection devices were installed. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, security efforts were more prominent, security checkpoints moved to the entrance of the visitor center. At the checkpoints, visitors are screened by magnetometers and x-ray equipment, devices which have been in place since 1997. The Arch also became one of several U.S. monuments placed under restricted airspace during 2002 Fourth of July celebrations. In 2003, , , movable Jersey barriers were installed to impede terrorist attacks on the arch. Later that year, it was announced that these walls were to be replaced by concrete posts encased in metal to be more harmonious with the steel color of the arch. The movable bollards can be manipulated from the park's dispatch center, which has also been upgraded. In 2006, arch officials hired a \\"physical security specialist,\\" replacing a law enforcement officer. The responsibilities of the specialist include risk assessment, testing the park's security system, increasing security awareness of other employees, and working with other government agencies to improve the arch's security procedures. Symbolism and culture Built as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States, the arch typifies \\"the pioneer spirit of the men and women who won the West, and those of a latter day to strive on other frontiers.\\" The arch has become the iconic image of St. Louis, appearing in many parts of city culture. In 1968, three years after the monument's opening, the St. Louis phone directory contained 65 corporations with \\"Gateway\\" in their title and 17 with \\"Arch\\". Arches also appeared over gas stations and drive-in restaurants. In the 1970s, a local sports team adopted the name \\"Fighting Arches\\"; St. Louis Community College would later (when consolidating all athletic programs under a single banner) name its sports teams \\"Archers\\". Robert S. Chandler, an NPS superintendent, said, \\"Most [visitors] are awed by the size and scale of the Arch, but they don't understand what it's all about ... Too many people see it as just a symbol of the city of St. Louis.\\" The Gateway Arch as seen from southern leg The arch has also appeared as a symbol of the State of Missouri. On November 22, 2002, at the Missouri State Capitol, Lori Hauser Holden, wife of then Governor Bob Holden uncovered the winning design for a Missouri coin design competition as part of the Fifty States Commemorative Coin Program. Designed by watercolorist Paul Jackson, the coin portrays \\"three members of the Lewis and Clark expedition paddling a boat on the Missouri River upon returning to St. Louis\\" with the arch as the backdrop. Holden said that the arch was \\"a symbol for the entire state ... Four million visitors each year see the Arch. [The coin] will help make it even more loved worldwide.\\" A special license plate designed by Arnold Worldwide featured the arch, labeled with \\".\\" Profits earned from selling the plates would fund the museum and other educational components of the arch. The Arch sits just above the Mississippi River Louchheim wrote that although the arch \\"has a simplicity which should guarantee timeliness\\", it is entirely modern as well because of the innovative design and its scientific considerations. In The Dallas Morning News, architectural critic David Dillon opined that the arch exists not as a functional edifice but as a symbol of \\"boundless American optimism\\". He articulates the arch's multiple \\"moods\\"‚Äî\\"reflective in sunlight, soft and pewterish in mist; crisp as a line drawing one moment, chimerical the next\\"‚Äîas a way the arch has \\"paid for itself many times over in wonder\\". Some have questioned whether St. Louis really was‚Äîas Saarinen said‚Äîthe \\"Gateway to the West\\". Kansas City-born \\"deadline poet\\" Calvin Trillin wrote, > I know you're thinking that there are considerable differences between T.S. > Eliot and me. Yes, it is true that he was from St. Louis, which started > calling itself the Gateway to the West after Eero Saarinen's Gateway Arch > was erected, and I'm from Kansas City, where people think of St. Louis not > as the Gateway to the West but as the Exit from the East. =Awards and recognitions= In 1966, the arch was given a Special Award for Excellence from the American Institute of Steel Construction for being \\"an outstanding achievement in technology and aesthetics.\\" On February 9, 1967, the arch received the Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award of 1967 from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The arch was once among Travel + Leisures unofficial rankings for the most-visited attraction in the world, after Lenin's Tomb, Disney World, Disneyland, and the Eiffel Tower. On February 22, 1990, the arch received the American Institute of Architects' (AIA) Twenty-Five Year Award for its \\"enduring significance that has withstood the test of time.\\" It was declared \\"a symbolic bridge between East and West, past and future, engineering and art\\" that \\"embodies the boundless optimism of a growing nation.\\" In 2007, the arch was ranked fourteenth on the AIA's \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" list. =Cultural references= * Dutch composer Peter Schat wrote a 1997 work, Arch Music for St. Louis, Op. 44. for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. It premiered on January 8, 1999, at the Powell Symphony Hall. Since Schat did not ascend the arch due to his fear of heights, he used his creativity to depict in music someone riding a tram to the top of the arch. * Paul Muldoon's poem, \\"The Stoic\\", is set under the Gateway Arch. The work, \\"an elegy for a miscarried foetus\\", describes Muldoon's ordeal standing under the Gateway Arch after his wife telephoned and informed him that the baby they were expecting had been miscarried. * Percy Jackson encounters Echidna and the Chimera in the Gateway Arch in Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief, after he, Grover Underwood and Aanabeth Chase visit the Arch during their trip to California to recover the Master Bolt. Percy faces the Chimera, and is blasted out of the Arch and falls into the Mississippi River. * A damaged Gateway Arch is prominently featured in Defiance, a science fiction television series. The apex is used as a radio station studio, with the arch itself acting as the station's antenna. Maintenance Welds on the arch's skin seal gaps between 4-by-8-foot sheets of stainless steel. Graffiti is scratched on the lower five to seven feet of the monument. The first act of vandalism was committed in June 1968: the vandals etched their names on various parts of the arch. In all, $10,000 was spent that year to repair damage from vandalism. The arch was first targeted by graffiti artists on March 5, 1969. In 2010, signs of corrosion were reported at the upper regions of the stainless steel surface. Carbon steel in the north leg has been rusting, possibly a result of water accumulation, a side effect of leaky welds in an environment that often causes rain to enter the skin of the structure. Maintenance workers use mops and a temporary setup of water containers to ease the problem. According to NPS documents, the corrosion and rust pose no safety concerns. A more comprehensive study of the corrosion had been suggested as early as 2006 by architectural specialists studying the Arch, and reiterated in a 2010 Historic Structure Report. In September 2010, the NPS granted Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. a contract for a structural study that would \\"gather data about the condition of the Arch to enable experts to develop and implement the right long-term solutions.\\" Stain samples were taken from the west face of the Arch on October 21, 2014, to determine the best way to clean it. The cleaning will cost about $340,000. In 1984, structural engineer Tibor Szegezdy told Smithsonian Magazine that the Arch could stand \\"considerably less than a thousand years\\" before collapsing in a wind storm.  Brickline Greenway  The Brickline Greenway Project is a major public-private partnership that aims to connect Forest Park and the Washington University in St. Louis Danforth Campus to the Gateway Arch grounds. Among the partners leading this project are the Arch to Park Collaborative, St. Louis City, and Washington University in St. Louis. The Brickline Greenway was known as the Chouteau Greenway prior to March 10, 2020.

He is also the author of the lyrics of \\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\", the national anthem of Italy. Biography Memorial tablet at the church of Santissima Trinit√† dei Pellegrini, Rome. The text states: \\"In this hospice poet Goffredo Mameli and many other valiant men died of wounds in defence of Rome for Italian freedom in the year MDCCCXLIX\\". The son of an aristocratic Sardinian admiral, Mameli was from Genoa where he was born, and where his father was in command of the fleet of the Kingdom of Sardinia. At the age of seven he was sent to Sardinia, to his grandfather's place, to escape the risk of cholera, but soon came back to Genoa to complete his studies. The achievements of Mameli's very short life are concentrated in only two years, during which time he played major parts in insurrectional movements and the Risorgimento. In 1847 Mameli joined the Societ√† Entelema, a cultural movement that soon would have turned to a political movement, and here he became interested in the theories of Giuseppe Mazzini. Mameli is mostly known as the author of the lyrics of the Italian national anthem, Il Canto degli Italiani (music by Michele Novaro), better known in Italy as Inno di Mameli (Mameli's Hymn). These lyrics were used for the first time in November 1847, celebrating King Charles Albert of Sardinia in his visit to Genoa after his first reforms. Mameli's lyrics to a \\"hymn of the people\\" ‚Äî\\"Suona la tromba\\"‚Äî were set by Giuseppe Verdi the following year. Mameli was deeply involved in nationalist movements and some more \\"spectacular\\" actions are remembered, such as his exposition of the Tricolore (current Italian flag, then prohibited) to celebrate the expulsion of Austrians in 1846. Yet, he was with Nino Bixio (Garibaldi's later major supporter and friend) in a committee for public health, already on a clear Mazzinian position. In March 1848, hearing of the insurrection in Milan, Mameli organised an expedition with 300 other patriots, joined Bixio's troops that were already on site, and entered the town. He was then admitted to Garibaldi's irregular army (really the volunteer brigade of general Torres), as a captain, and met Mazzini. Back in Genoa, he worked more on a literary side, wrote several hymns and other compositions, he became the director of the newspaper Diario del Popolo (\\"People's Daily\\"), and promoted a press campaign for a war against Austria. In December 1848 Mameli reached Rome, where Pellegrino Rossi had been murdered, helping in the clandestine works for declaration (9 February 1849) of the Roman Republic. Mameli then went to Florence where he proposed the creation of a common state between Tuscany and Latium. In April 1849 he was again in Genoa, with Bixio, where a popular insurrection was strongly opposed by General Alberto La Marmora. Mameli soon left again for Rome, where the French had come to support the Papacy (Pope Pius IX had actually escaped from the town) and took active part in the combat. =Death= Luciano Campisi's grave monument to Mameli in Campo Verano, Rome, built in 1891. During the siege of Rome, he was an aide of Giuseppe Garibaldi, who fought in Palestrina (9 May) and in Velletri (19 May). In particular he fought in the defense of the Villa del Vascello on the Janiculum hill. He was wounded in the left leg by the French during the last assault of 3 June at Villa Corsini, occupied by the French. However, there is a theory that he was accidentally wounded by the bayonet of a fellow soldier. Mameli suffered from gangrene, which doctor Pietro Maestri observed after four days. After a consultation with Maestri and other doctors, it was decided to amputate the leg, performed by surgeon Paolo Maria Raffaello Baroni. Despite this, the infection gradually increased to the point of causing death by sepsis, on 6 July 1849, at the age of 21, in the hospice of Trinit√† dei Pellegrini. He was originally buried at Campo Verano in Rome, however, his remains were moved to the Mausoleo Ossario del Gianicolo in 1941.

Using a shortened Hornet platform and bodywork with a pronounced kammback tail, the Gremlin was classified as an economy car and competed with the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, as well as imported cars including the Volkswagen Beetle and Toyota Corolla. The small domestic automaker marketed the Gremlin as \\"the first American-built import.\\" The Gremlin reached a total production of 671,475 over a single generation‚Äîand was superseded by a restyled and revised variant, the AMC Spirit.  History  =Origin and design= The idea for the Gremlin began in 1966 when design chief at American Motors, Dick Teague, and stylist Bob Nixon discussed the possibility of a shortened version of AMC's compact car. On an airline flight, Teague's solution, which he said he sketched on an air sickness bag, was to truncate the tail of a Javelin. Bob Nixon joined AMC as a 23-year-old and did the first formal design sketches in 1967 for the car that was to be the Gremlin. Ford and General Motors were to launch new subcompact cars for 1971, but AMC did not have the financial resources to compete with an entirely new design. Teague's idea of using the pony car Javelin resulted in the AMX-GT concept, first shown at the New York International Auto Show in April 1968. This version did not go into production, but the AMX name was used from 1968 to 1970 on a shortened, two- seat sports car built from the Javelin. 1971 AMC Gremlin X, 1972 Ford Pinto Runabout and 1973 Chevrolet Vega GT 1978 Gremlin X Instead, Bob Nixon, AMC's future Chief of Design, designed the new subcompact based on the automaker's Hornet model, a compact car. The design reduced the wheelbase from and the overall length from , making the Gremlin two inches (50 mm) longer than the Volkswagen Beetle and shorter than the Ford Pinto and Chevrolet Vega. Capitalizing on AMC's advantage as a small car producer, the Gremlin was introduced on April 1, 1970. The April 6, 1970, cover of Newsweek magazine featured a red Gremlin for its article, \\"Detroit Fights Back: The Gremlin\\". The car was available as a \\"base\\" two-passenger version with no rear seat and a fixed rear window, at a suggested retail price of $1,879, and as a four-seat hatchback with an opening rear window, at $1,959 (US$ in dollars). From the front of the car to the B-pillars, the Gremlin was essentially the same as the AMC Hornet. Although it was only fractionally longer than the contemporary Volkswagen Beetle, Time said the length of its hood over the front-mounted engine made \\"the difference seem considerably more\\", adding that the car \\"resembles a sawed-off station wagon, with a long, low hood and swept-up rear, and is faintly reminiscent of the original Studebaker Avanti.\\" As with the Volkswagen, the Gremlin's styling set it apart from other cars. Time said, \\"like some other cars of less than standard size, the back seat is designed for small children only.\\" The Gremlin's wider stance gave it \\"a stable, quiet and relatively comfortable ride‚Äîfor the two front passengers‚Äù, for whom, by small-car standards, there was more than average interior width, seat room, and legroom. The six cubic feet of luggage space behind the back seat was less than in the rear-engined Volkswagen Beetle, but with the seat folded the cargo area tripled to . The upright design of the tail, which enlarged interior space, was aerodynamically efficient. Later, European and Japanese manufacturers similarly created different body styles on one compact car chassis by extending or curtailing the trunk (e.g. Volkswagen's Jetta and Golf models). =Marketing= Designed and named by Teague to look either \\"cute or controversial - depending on one's viewpoint ... for many, it seemed perfect for the free-thinking early 1970s.\\" American Motors executives apparently felt confident enough to not worry that the Gremlin name might have negative connotations. Time magazine noted two definitions for gremlin: \\"Defined by Webster's as 'a small gnome held to be responsible for malfunction of equipment.' American Motors' definition: 'a pal to its friends and an ogre to its enemies.'\\" The car's cartoon-inspired mascot was marketed for product differentiation and was intended to be memorable to consumers. The Gremlin's hatchback design was also needed to make the car stand out in the competitive marketplace, and according to Teague: \\"Nobody would have paid it any attention if it had looked like one of the Big Three\\" automobiles. AMC promoted the Gremlin as \\"America's first subcompact\\". This description overlooks the Nash Metropolitan and the earlier Crosley. The Metropolitan‚Äîa subcompact-sized The term \\"subcompact\\" was not in use to describe the Metropolitan's size: \\"During World War II and immediately afterwards, Mason began to explore the idea of developing a truly small car, the size of what today we'd call a subcompact.\\" captive import, American-conceived and American-designed for the American market, and built in the UK with a British engine‚Äîhas a claim to be \\"America's first subcompact.\\"Note: the North American categories of \\"compact\\", \\"subcompact\\", \\"midsize\\" etc. had not come into use when the Metropolitan was made. It was called an economy car, not a subcompact, at the time. (Contemporary articles also called the Metropolitan \\"a small automobile\\"; in sales brochures it was \\"America's entirely new kind of car\\" (1955), \\"Luxury in Miniature\\" (1959), and \\"crafted for personal transportation\\" (1960). Sales brochures. Retrieved 27 June 2014. One writer described it as \\"little larger than a toy car.\\") The Metropolitan fits the \\"subcompact\\" classification, as stated in the following: \\"[T]he...president of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation decided to market what would ultimately be called a \\"subcompact\\"...\\" Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, \\"1954‚Äì1962 Metropolitan\\", 23 October 2007. Retrieved 27 June 2014. Numerous small American-made cars, e.g. American Austin, American Bantam, Crosley and World War I-era \\"cyclecars\\" such as the American, existed long before the Gremlin. (Except for the cyclecars, those cited are classified as microcars.) \\"List of microcars\\", Vintage Microcar Club. Retrieved 27 June 2014. AMC marketed the Gremlin as \\"cute and different,\\" a strategy successful in attracting more than 60 percent of purchasers under the age of 35. =Annual changes (1970‚Äì1978)=  1970  AMC Gremlin logo on gas cap The Gremlin debuted in April 1970 with AMC's I6, a seven main bearing design which produced as standard equipment, with AMC's I6 - producing - as an option. AMC said the Gremlin offered \\"the best gas mileage of any production car made in America\\". According to the auto editors of Consumer Guide it had \\"an unusually long option list for the era\\" so owners could have luxury and conveniences typically found in more expensive cars, and these options \\"came with a much higher profit margin\\" for the automaker. As the first of the new domestic subcompact cars, \\"the Gremlin has been the most talked-about car since its introduction.\\" Sales for the abbreviated model year were 25,300. Popular Science assigned its editor to the equivalent of one year of driving by conducting a cross-country road test of a brand new Gremlin, and reported after driving it \\"without a single problem is an enviable record\\" and that \\"we were all impressed with the quality of this vehicle.\\" A nationwide survey based on owners driving their 1970 AMC Gremlins over conducted by Popular Mechanics concluded that the unique styling attracted many buyers, but economy topped their likes.  1971  1971 AMC Gremlin X For the 1971 model year the \\"X\\" appearance/equipment trim package was introduced as a $300 option on the 4-passenger model and \\"proved extremely popular.\\" It included body side tape stripes, body color front fascia, slotted road wheels with D70x14 Goodyear Polyglas tires, blackout grille insert, bucket seats, and \\"X\\" decals. The 2-passenger Gremlin version entered into its second and final season. The I6 engine that was optional for 1970 became standard, while a longer-stroke version became the option. Compression ratios dropped from 8.5:1 to 8:1 for 1971, resulting in (gross) from the and (gross) from the Flory, p. 787. 1971 Gremlin prices increased slightly (up by $20 to $1,899 for the base model), and sales for this first full model year rose to 53,480.Flory, p. 789.  1972  1972 AMC Gremlin All Gremlins received a new body-colored front fascia treatment for 1972. Among many other changes was an available V8 engine. It was \\"the muscle car formula of stuffing a big motor in a small car.\\" Engine ratings were downgraded to more accurate Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) net hp figures, bringing the engine to , the to Flory, p. 866. and the 304 V8 to . Even with the lower engine output ratings across the industry, \\"the V8 Gremlin was a poor-man's Corvette, able to spin its rear tires at will and outrun some larger, more expensive pony cars\\" and it was \\"the only real performance car available under $2,200.\\" The base two- seater model was discontinued, having sold 3,017 units in 18 months.Flory, p. 868. Gremlins also switched from non-synchronized 1st gear manual transmissions to full synchromesh, and the Borg-Warner-sourced automatic transmission was replaced by the Chrysler-designed TorqueFlite. Other more minor technical upgrades improved the car's reliability and durability. The Gremlin X package continued to be popular, while optional features now included an AM/FM radio, fabric sunroof, tilt steering wheel, inside hood release, trailer towing package for up to with a Class 1 hitch, as well as manual or power assisted front disk brakes. American Motors introduced the automobile industry's first 12-month or bumper-to-bumper warranty, called the \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\". Its foundation was an emphasis on quality and durability, improved production by reducing the number of models and increasing the level of standard equipment. The new warranty included an innovative promise to customers that AMC would repair anything wrong with the car (except for tires). Owners were provided with a toll-free number to the company, as well as a free loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight. Numerous production and product improvements would result in fewer warranty claims, better public relations, and greater customer satisfaction and loyalty. Model year 1972 sales totaled 61,717, a 15% gain over the previous year.  1973  1973 AMC Gremlin X with Levi interior For the 1973 model year, AMC strengthened bumpers able to withstand a impact in the front and a impact in the rear, without any damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment according to new mandates by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Optional was a Levi's interior trim package, which included spun nylon upholstery made to look like denim (fire safety regulations prohibited the use of real cotton denim). Details included removable map pockets, burnished copper denim rivets, and red Levi's logo tabs. Rear-seat legroom was increased. The X package received a new tape- striping pattern that kicked up over the Gremlin's rear-wheel flares. Sales improved to 122,844 units, nearly 30% more than in 1972. A 1973 Gremlin purchased by Consumer Reports was top-rated in a group of six subcompact models tested for the June issue. That car had relatively few sample defects and proved reliable over a long-term test.  1974  1974 AMC Gremlin The Arab Oil Embargo of October 1973 came just as the 1974 model year began. AMC improved the Gremlin's back seat. A deeper front fascia made the car appear longer. A larger front bumper was mounted on self-restoring telescoping gas and oil cylinders. Unlike most other designs, the Gremlin did not use a filler panel between the bumper and body. A stronger rear bumper was set lower‚Äîfront and rear passenger car bumpers were now required by NHTSA to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain impacts with no damage. The rear fascia was modified slightly to blend with the design changes. The Gremlin X stripe pattern was given a \\"hockey stick\\" look for 1974: the stripes followed the window line as it tapered aft, and swept up now to include four diagonal lines on the wide C-pillar. A new typeface for nameplates was used by AMC for 1974, including on the Gremlin. With the car's 1974 model year extended into November to delay the need to install catalytic converters required by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2004 regulations starting with 1975 models, AMC sold 171,128 1974 Gremlins, an increase of nearly 40% over 1973 and 130% over 1971.  1975  1975 AMC Gremlin Changes for the 1975 model year Gremlins included standard electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Gremlins featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. \\"Unleaded Fuel Only\\" warnings were placed by the fuel filler and on the fuel gauge. Gremlins with I6 engines and manual transmissions gained a new option, the electrically operated overdrive from Laycock de Normanville. The 0.714:1 \\"J-type\\" unit was controlled by a pushbutton at the end of the turn signal stalk. When turned on, the unit engaged automatically at speeds above and dropped out at . An accelerator pedal kickdown switch provided faster passing when needed. Steel- belted radial tires were now standard on Gremlins with the X package. American Motors was promoting its economical models covered by the comprehensive \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\" warranty, as well as preparing for the launch of the Pacer The automaker was planning to spend half of the entire 1975 advertising budget on the new Pacer. Marketing for the Gremlin included tie-ins with a \\"Home Value Days\\" supplement designed to promote 18,500 hardware stores in Popular Science and The Reader's Digest as well as with Colgate-Palmolive's campaign using Willie Mays to \\"Help Young America\\" in Jet and Ebony. The U.S. subcompacts were compared to the new, front-wheel-drive Volkswagen Rabbit that replaced the aging Beetle. Popular Science road tests showed the Gremlin to be the fastest and quietest of all, but had the lowest fuel efficiency with an average EPA rating of , compared to the Chevrolet Vega's , Ford Pinto's , and the Rabbit's . The Gremlin had an I6 engine and a three-speed transmission (in contrast to the I4 engines and four-speed transmissions in the other cars) and weighed over more than the VW Rabbit. Struggling under stagflation and an inflationary economy, all the domestic subcompact cars' sales slumped compared to the industry's record-breaking 1973 model year. In total, AMC sold 56,011 Gremlins in the (albeit shortened) 1975 model year, a 67% drop. The success of the innovative Pacer launched in mid-February 1975 \\"severely cut\\" the sales of both the Gremlin and Hornet models.  1976  1976 AMC Gremlin Changes were greater for 1976. Oval headlight bezels replaced the previous circular items. The grille shape became a stretched hexagon and included in its insert two opposing loops stacked atop each other and housing new rounded parking/turn signal lights. Front fenders were taller, with a slight finned effect. A new \\"Custom\\" trim line debuted, featuring a striped interior trim called \\"Potomac\\", as well as a spare tire cover and other minor details. The A models were given another new striping scheme: the hockey stick-style stripe of the previous year adding a secondary extension that ran from the door- handle straight back. The X package was now available only on Custom models. Due to flagging sales, the V8 engine option (now downgraded to ) was cancelled at midyear, after only 826 installations. (A total of 40,994 Gremlins were equipped with the V8 engine from 1972 to 1976.) A 4-speed manual transmission was made available at midyear. Sales tapered slightly to 52,941 - a decline of 5.5%. The 3-speed manual transmission also had the option of an electric overdrive when in third gear. Overdrive operation was by a push-button on the turn signal stalk. There may have been 600 to 700 of these built.  1977  1977 AMC Gremlin featured new front end styling 1977 AMC Gremlin Custom 2 Liter 1977 changes included redesigned sheet metal for the first time in the Gremlin's now 8-year history: revised hood, shorter front fenders, new bumpers, taller glass tailgate, enlarged taillights, and rear license plate now covering the fuel filler. The front end was shortened by four inches (102 mm) with all-new sheet metal and a crosshatch grille insert. Parking lights reverted to rectangular, and headlights were recessed into square bezels with rounded corners. The new hood had a small \\"power bulge\\" at the front. The base model now included carpeting, as well as rocker panel and wheel lip moldings. The \\"Custom\\" model was available with a list price of $2,998. The X package returned as a $189 option, with a new striping pattern that ran straight back from the front fenders and crested upward over the rear wheels. Front disc brakes became standard. At the start of the model year, the Gremlin was available with either the standard or optional six-cylinder engines. Both had increased power from updated cylinder heads and two-barrel carburetors. In addition, AMC offered a carbureted four-cylinder engine: a Volkswagen/Audi inline-four, also used in fuel-injected form in the Porsche 924. It gave better fuel economy but less power than the standard six-cylinder engines, and reduced the Gremlin's weight by , allowing it to achieve an EPA rating of in the city, and on the highway. It was reserved for the Custom version of the Gremlin because the expense of acquiring the rights to the engine meant that AMC could not afford to make it standard equipment. Of 46,171 Gremlins built for 1977 (13% less than in 1976), 7,558 had the new 2.0 L engine.  1978  1978 AMC Gremlin X In its final year of 1978, the Gremlin received a number of changes, but customers on a tighter budget could still get a standard six-cylinder base model Gremlin for under US$3,400. A new \\"Custom\\" model featured either the four- or six-cylinder engine with a standard four- speed manual transmission and new vinyl bucket seats, wheel lip moldings, and other trim upgrades. Inside the Gremlin there was a revised instrument panel borrowed from the then-new 1978 Concord. The dashboard had high-level ventilation HVAC, radio switchgear within easier reach, and a flat, full-width top. The X's tape striping pattern was revised to match the 1978 Concord Sport package design, with the stripe at the lower body side and curving over the wheel lip. At mid-season, a GT package became available with a front spoiler and flared wheel openings as on the 1978 AMX. The GT added an aluminum overlay to the instrument panel, was powered by the I6 as standard, and had its own stripe scheme: a wide tape stripe, outlined by a narrow one, ran back from the front fenders and widened aft of the rear quarter windows. The package also included body-color fender flares and front air dam, as well as body-color bumpers, all of which combined to give the GT a modern, aggressive look. Fewer than 3,000 Gremlin GTs were built. The Gremlin's body shape had not changed appreciably in its nine years of production, and other more advanced subcompacts, lighter in weight, with more doors, better interiors and front- wheel drive, had appeared on the market. Gremlin sales for the final year fell 52% to 22,104 units. By the time production ceased, a total of 671,475 Gremlins had been built. The updated AMC Spirit replaced the Gremlin for the 1979 model year, basically \\"a Gremlin with conventional styling ... Lovable, sturdy cars are hard to kill.\\" = Performance = The Gremlin was faster than other subcompacts of the time. Motor Trend magazine recorded zero to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 12.6 seconds with the engine. The Ford Pinto and the VW Beetle were in the 18-second range. Fuel economy was to with the small six, compared with the 35-plus mpg economy of the VW Beetle. Although front-heaviness was generally thought to compromise the handling, Tom McCahill wrote in Mechanix Illustrated that the Gremlin was \\"fast and easy\\", with a comparatively stiff ride because of the shortened rear springs. He ran a 232-engined Gremlin with automatic transmission from zero to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 11.9 seconds, saw on the Daytona Speedway straightaway, and summarized: \\"On a dollar for dollar basis, I rate the Gremlin the best American buy of the year\\". Car and Driver magazine also recorded 0 to 60 mph in 11.9 seconds with a 232-powered Gremlin. Automobile Quarterlys article \\"A Critical Look at the 1973 American Cars\\" summarized that the basic \\"Gremlin offers outstanding performance for an economy car and excellent fuel mileage.\\" When Popular Mechanics magazine tested the car with the Audi four-cylinder engine introduced in 1977, they said its acceleration with a four-speed manual felt \\"amazingly strong\\", with 0-60 mph and quarter-mile times one second slower than with the 232 cubic inch straight-six (16 vs. 15, and 21 vs. 20 seconds respectively). The smaller engine produced EPA mileage of highway and city. The Gremlin's body was heavier and stronger than its domestic or imported rivals. The engines were also more powerful than the Gremlin's main domestic and imported competition. The powertrains were smoother and more reliable, and the car had fewer recalls. Its chief import rival was the Volkswagen Beetle, which did not handle as well, got similar gas mileage from about 40% of the Gremlin's horsepower. The same overall size as the Gremlin, it was packaged marginally better. Gremlin designer Richard Teague commented in Motor Trend that to compare the Beetle (whose basic design originated in the late 1930s) to the Gremlin in profile and body design was like \\"comparing a Ford GT40 to the Hindenburg\\". The Gremlin holds the \\"distinction of offering one of the widest engine ranges of all time‚Äîfrom two litres to five litres.\\" =Randall 401-XR= Randall AMC dealership in Mesa, Arizona, received AMC's endorsement to build V8 powered Gremlins. The cars started out as 304 cubic inch V8 models from the factory and after Randall's modifications would run 13.90 seconds at 103- in the quarter mile, for $2,995 (US$ in dollars). Known as the Randall 401-XR (X for Gremlin X, R for Randall), a total of twenty cars were built for the street and one for the strip during 1972, 1973, and 1974. In 2012, the Randalls built a 22nd Continuation Plum 1974 Gremlin 401XR, originally intending to build a few, but only built one. Car Craft magazine tested one with some modifications and achieved in 12.22 seconds while still remaining a \\"totally streetable, daily-driver\\". In 1972, Super Stock magazine had a \\"Special Gremlin\\" issue. One of the features was of Randall's 1972 Gremlin 401XR Super Stock drag car that was raced at the 1972 Winter Nationals.  Competition  Modified 1977 AMC Gremlin at a dragstrip The \\"99 WIBG\\" Pro- Stock 1972 AMC Gremlin The AMC Gremlin saw action on numerous auto racing venues, including endurance, as well as oval and road racing. Due to their inherent inexpensiveness, strength, and the ease with which they could be modified for higher performance, many AMC Gremlins were used in drag racing. In the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) RS series for compact sedans, Raleigh, North Carolina's \\"Team Highball\\", run by Amos Johnson and Bunny Johnson, was the AMC factory-backed team, with Amos Johnson, Whit Diggett, and later, Dennis Shaw driving. The torque of their 6-cylinder Gremlins gave a big advantage on the faster tracks like the Daytona International Speedway, where they were often more than a match for the BMW 2002, Alfa Romeo GTV, Datsun 510, Ford Pinto, Mercury Capri, and Opel Manta. Johnson was the series 1973 co-champion, while independent driver George Alderman took the 1974 title. Starting in 1970, Wally Booth headed AMC's Pro Stock drag racing efforts. He and other drivers campaigned Gremlins painted in the hash red, white, and blue pattern that AMC had adopted as its corporate race livery. Dick Arons built the engines. The team \\"transformed the brand's staid grocery-getter reputation from the ground up into that of a genuine performance powerhouse\\". Wally Booth \\"was one of the Edelbrock crew's favorite racers\\". During Randall AMC creation of the Gremlin 401XR. Grant and Mike Randall owners of Randall Rambler/AMC, built a 1972 Gremlin 401XR Drag Car, that they raced at the ARHA Winter Nationals 1972. The Randalls also came out with a high-Performance AMC Engine Tuning guide, and also \\"Randall Rambler & Jeep Speed Bible\\" Three factory Pro-Stock 1972 Gremlin drag racers were campaigned around the nation. One was driven by Rich LaMont and sponsored by radio station 99 WIBG in Philadelphia, PA. This car has been restored with a AMC V8 with 4-speed manual transmission and it still runs the quarter-mile at around 8.75 seconds achieving over . At the 2006 World Power Wheelstanding Championships (not a race, but a \\"wheelie\\" contest), Brian Ambrosini's specially modified 1974 Gremlin took second place. The car gets all four of its wheels off the ground by its modified AMC V8 producing and achieving average quarter-mile e.t. in the low 8s with a trap speed of around . The body of the Gremlin was widely used by NASCAR paved and dirt modified stock car teams in the northeastern U.S. and elsewhere from the 1970s to the early 1990s. It was believed that Gremlin's long roof with its rear kick-up provided aerodynamic advantages over the more commonly used Pinto and Vega bodies. Lenny Podbielski was \\"a major player in late 1970s Speedbowl action\\" and the Gremlin-bodied machines he raced were \\"some of the prettiest cars of the era\\".  Other markets  = Mexico = VAM Gremlin in Mazatl√°n, Mexico 1979 VAM Gremlin X in Mexico City (missing side decals) Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) manufactured Gremlins in Mexico under license and partial ownership (38% equity share) by AMC. Although the Gremlin was introduced to the U.S. and Canadian markets in 1970, VAM continued assembling its version of the Hornet still bearing the name Rambler American as its smallest, least expensive car until 1974. The fact that VAM already had three lines of products (the top limit permitted by legislation) from 1968 through 1973 made it impossible for the Gremlin to be offered. It was until the discontinuation of the Javelin line in 1973 that free space was available for Gremlin production, making 1974 its year of debut. The 1974 Gremlin was the third VAM car not to bear the Rambler name since the 1968 Javelin and the 1972 Classic (Matador in the U.S.) models. Moreover, the Mexican market continued to use the Gremlin model name for VAM's version of the AMC Spirit sedan from 1979 through 1983, several years after the Gremlin nameplate was withdrawn in the U.S. market. The VAM cars had trim, interiors, and model names that differed from the equivalent AMC-made models. All engines built by VAM were of AMC design, modified to deal with Mexico's lower octane gasoline and higher altitudes. The VAM Gremlin was the only car line of its time not to be available with VAM's version of AMC's I6, due to the economy market segment focus of the cars. This is exactly the opposite case as the AMC Gremlin, which was offered with the option of a 304 V8. The three-speed manual transmission with overdrive, the four-speed manual transmission, the V8 and Audi four-cylinder engines were never available. Trim levels and versions like the two-seater, the Levis Gremlin, the Gremlin Custom, and the Gremlin GT were also never available.  1974  The introductory 1974 Gremlins became unique by incorporating the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted to hide the relationship between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with a full synchromesh manual 3-speed transmission, heavy-duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, 3.31:1 rear gear ratio, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, collapsible steering column with anti-theft lock, base steering wheel, side marker and hazard lights, column-mounted shifters only, two-tone padded dashboard with silver-colored front surfaces, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, folding bench seats, two- point front seatbelts, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sun visors, sound-insulating cardboard- type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Factory options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, wheel trim rings, and heavy-duty cooling. All VAM Gremlins used AMC's three- pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory, which could be equipped with a universal tachometer or clock as dealership options. The introductory year production was 2,137.  1975  The 1975 Gremlin models were upgraded, and along with the improvements to the larger car lines VAM took 9% of the Mexican market. VAM Gremlin interiors now featured individual folding front seats with low backs and new door panels, the \\"two-tone\\" dashboard with silver-painted front surfaces was replaced by a color-keyed unit, and a new fuel economy gauge was standard on the third space of the instrument cluster. Manual front disk brakes and electronic ignition were among the mechanical upgrades, while the compression ratio of the engine was dropped to 7.6:1. Both transmissions now came only with a floor-mounted shifter. VAM Gremlins ordered with automatic transmissions now included a heater and power steering at no charge. The exterior featured a variation of AMC's \\"hockey stick\\" side decal and a new design for headlight bezels, grille, and parking lights at the front end that AMC originally developed for its Hornet models. Production doubled to over 4,200 VAM Gremlins.  1976  The Gremlin X version was added in 1976 as a separate model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights under the parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market. The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the \\"Navajo\\" pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets. The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models. Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160 km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.  1977  Starting with the 1977 models, all VAM Gremlins were powered by the I6 regardless of trim level. The exterior featured the shorter new front end clip and rear end treatment as did the U.S. models. The 1977 Gremlin X model included a new digital tachometer and three-point retractable seatbelts, as well as new in-house VAM designs for the seats. The sporty side decal was slightly revised. The seatbelts on the base Gremlin were also changed to three-point units, which were fixed and lacked retractable mechanisms. The option list was expanded with the possibility of ordering a factory air conditioning system for the first time in the VAM line, which was available only in the X model. The previously optional dealership-offered universal air conditioning system remained available for the base model. The VAM Gremlin X (along with the 1977-1979 American ECD, Concord DL four-door equivalent) would be the only VAM car with the 258 I6 engines to be available with a factory air conditioning system, as all other VAM models with it would be units. Around 6,800 VAM Gremlins were sold during 1977.  1978  Only a few changes were made to the 1978 VAM Gremlin. The dashboard design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X, there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length bodyside decal incorporated the \\"Gremlin X\\" logo on the rear quarter panel. The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.  Second Generation  VAM Gremlins used the updated body design of the U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM versions of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer to be perceived as outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time a case like this happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name. = Australia = One-off Australian Gremlin, first featured at the 1970 Sydney Motor Show. Badged as a \\"Rambler\\" this test car was converted from LHD to RHD for evaluation purposes. AMC exported a fully built Gremlin to its Australian partner, Australian Motor Industries (AMI) of Port Melbourne, Victoria in 1970 for evaluation purposes. (AMI assembled and marketed other AMC models since 1961.) The evaluation model was painted in AMC's \\"Big Bad Orange\\" and was converted from left-hand drive to right-hand drive by Sydney Toyota dealer Bill Buckle Pty Ltd. The car featured AMC's six-cylinder engine and a three- speed manual transmission. The car was presented at the 1970 Sydney Motor Show to gauge interest and test the market. The car was featured on the front cover of the November 1970 issue of Australia's top motoring magazine, Wheels magazine. The magazine's review pointed to the likelihood that the \\"local content\\" requirements would force the price up to that of the high-priced, Australian-assembled Hornet, and probably price the car out of the market. For marketing purposes, it was branded as a \\"Rambler Gremlin\\" in keeping with the use of the Rambler marque for all AMC vehicles sold in Australia despite that Rambler as a brand was retired in the United States at the end of the 1969 model year. However, no Gremlin models were put into production in Australia. Right-hand-drive Gremlins were imported into Australia by U.S. servicemen. = United Kingdom = American Motors vehicles were exported to the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s and sold by Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Ltdhttps://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors in London with dealers in London, Yorks, Kent, and Worcester. While earlier models such as the Rambler Classic, Rebel, Ambassador, and Matador had been exported as completed factory right-hand-drive vehicles, only left-hand-drive Gremlins were exported to the United Kingdom. A U.K company called C.T. Wooler, in Andover, Hampshire had been in the business for a long time converting LHD cars to RHD and entered into an agreement with AMC to convert AMC vehicles. C.T Wooler converted Gremlins as well as AMC Pacers and Jeeps.  Hurst Rescue System 1  1973 Hurst Rescue System 1 Between 1972 and 1974, Hurst Performance marketed \\"a highway safety vehicle\\" for emergency services, as well as a compact alternative to trucks for motorsport race tracks. The \\"Hurst Rescue System 1\\" was based on the AMC Gremlin and designed to quickly assist vehicle extrication of crash victims. The vehicle came with the \\"Hurst Rescue Tool\\", commonly known as \\"The Jaws of Life\\", winch, stretcher, as well as firefighting and first aid supplies. The vehicle also included push bumpers and a 25-gallon water tank. The price for this fully equipped rescue vehicle was between $11,000 to $13,000. =Police= A 1975 Gremlin was used as an experimental police vehicle by the Houston Police Department's Traffic Bureau, but this did not result in fleet orders.  Experimental cars  The Gremlin proved a popular testbed for experiments with alternative fuels. Many universities converted them to run on natural gas, hydrogen, and electric power. = Hydrogen = In 1972 University of California, Los Angeles researchers won a nationwide Urban Vehicle Design Competition when they modified a 1972 AMC Gremlin to run on hydrogen. The lessons learned are still useful today. The engine was a converted Ford V8 noted for its volumetric efficiency. Lacking sophisticated electronics and injection systems, the carburetor was a modified propane unit and the \\"thermos\\"-type hydrogen tank gave the Gremlin a range of . Tests indicated that the car would not only meet the scheduled 1976 vehicle United States emission standards, but also actually emit slightly cleaner air than it took in. As part of the 1972 Urban Vehicle Design Competition, UCLA engineering students also enlarged the side glass area above the rear wheels for improved visibility, designed a roll cage which projected through the Gremlin's roof to double as a roof rack, and designed 5 MPH bumpers with an environmentally-friendly energy-absorbing popcorn core, covered with a recycled-tire tread surface. In 1984, UCLA's first hydrogen- powered car was sold for one dollar to the William F. Harrah Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. In 2010, the car was available on an auction site. = Alternative fuels = Other experiments used AMC Gremlins. To evaluate non- petroleum fuel and measure mechanical wear under mostly short city driving, a 1970 Gremlin with AMC's engine operated successfully on methanol for ten years and . The broadest range of fuel tests were conducted by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) labs in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Engineers estimated the performance and fuel economy of 1977 Gremlin Xs operating on ordinary gasoline, a variety of wide boiling range fuels (naphtha, kerosene, etc.), as well as two alcohols, ethanol and methanol. = Electric = Seattle City Light Superintendent Gordon Vickery at charging station for the electric Gremlin The Electric Fuel Propulsion Company (EFP) of Ferndale, Michigan, produced a number of electric cars including the AMC Gremlin based, two- passenger X-144. Introduced in 1973 it featured a direct current motor fueled by a 144-volt cobalt-lead storage batteries designed to reduce the formation of harmful gases during recharging, as well as a regular 12-volt battery to operate the cars lights, horn, and heater blower. Performance was claimed to be similar to a base gasoline Gremlin, including a top speed of , but with a calculated lower cost per mile for the X-144 over five years and of use. Inventor \\"Cotton\\" Whatley of Wichita Falls, Texas, offered an unknown number of modified electric Gremlins for sale through various dealerships between 1973 and 1978. Whatley's Gremlin Electric had a top speed of and a maximum range of .  Exhibition  Engineers at Coleman Products Corporation in Coleman, Wisconsin, created a non-drivable plexiglas Gremlin as a demonstrator of the placement and function of electrical wiring harnesses.  Concept Gremlins  = Gremlin Voyager = In 1972 AMC developed a prototype \\"Gremlin Voyager\\" with a slide out rear panel called \\"Grem-Bin\\". The car was a production Gremlin with a proposed \\"shelf\\" design to make cargo loading easier. = XP prototype = AMC Gremlin XP concept car In 1974 a production car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps over the roof while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked-out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar. = G/II prototype = Another 1974 Gremlin was modified with a front end from the Hornet. The concept car received a special grille, but the most radical design feature was its fastback roofline. This concept car turned out to be similar to the Gremlin's replacement, the liftback Spirit model introduced for the 1979 model year. = Concept 80 = In 1977 American Motors presented six show cars to illustrate the automaker's commitment to smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles for the 1980s. Three of them, the \\"Concept I\\", \\"Concept II\\", and \\"Concept Grand Touring\\" represented new subcompact designs. * The Concept I car combined a \\"wedge-design\\" with a short hood, low body beltline, steeply raked windshield, and expanded glass area. The front featured a mesh grille with \\"rally-type\\" parking lights and rectangular headlamps. The rear end was squared off featuring large rear quarter windows to eliminate blind spots. The rear panel incorporated a characteristic continental tire bulge. *The Concept II design was another Gremlin replacement proposal featuring integral soft bumpers, headlamps concealed by flush sliding doors. A pronounced center structural \\"Targa-band\\" was designed to add strength to the roof. The squared- off rear end featured a glass hatchback. *The Concept Grand Touring was a larger luxury hatchback designed for four-passengers. The interior was appointed in leather and corduroy upholstery and luxury appointments with deep-pile carpeting. The front end featured a \\"venturi\\" grille with rally-type lights. The rear side windows were \\"opera\\" recessed and surrounded by a vinyl cover that ran over the roof's rear quarter. The Concept GT car had genuine wire wheels. Design elements from the Concept II and Concept GT were incorporated into the Gremlin's replacement, the AMC Spirit that was introduced in 1979.  Production history and reception  The 1970s was one of the most volatile periods in the history of the automobile industry that is renowned for its ups and downs. A total of 671,475 Gremlins were sold in the United States and Canada, making it the most popular single generation body style/chassis produced by AMC (other models, such as the Rambler and even Hornet, have higher production numbers, but consisted of more than one chassis design and body style in the case of the Rambler, multiple body styles for the Hornet). A book about the popular history of the 1970s introduces it as the decade of \\"pet rocks, shag carpets, platform shoes and the AMC Gremlin.\\" It is among the cars that people who were in high school in the late 1970s and early 1980s would be familiar with because it was one of the first cars they drove and among most often seen in student parking lots. Kiplinger's personal finance magazine, Changing Times, listed the AMC Gremlin as first among the best subcompact used cars as \\"selected by top mechanics for good value, good service.\\" Five years after the Gremlin's introduction, the mechanics liked the six-cylinder engine and most preferred automatic transmission. Comments included, \\"I have one. It's the greatest. I own one with a 304 V-8 engine. Have no trouble outside of normal maintenance.\\" During the early 1970s American cars \\"are remembered far more often for their power than their style, and ... throughout the decade, the character of cars became blurred. Only a handful of cars had real personalities....\\" the AMC Gremlin was one of them, \\"a pioneering hatchback\\". According to Tom and Ray Magliozzi, \\"it's easy to criticize this car now, because just about any car from the early '70s would look bad next to today's cars. They had no fuel injection, no independent suspension, no air bags, no anti-lock brakes, no nothing! But compared with the other cars of its era, the Gremlin wasn't bad.\\" Officially discontinued after the 1978 model year, the Gremlin was restyled, including a new model that featured a sloping liftback for 1979 and the model line renamed the AMC Spirit. This restyled continuation of the familiar chopped-tail two-door and the new hatch coupe caused sales to increase to 52,478 units for 1979. The original \\"Kammback\\" body style continued in production until 1982 as the Spirit Sedan with larger rear side windows. The basic design was also used for the small AMC Eagle Kammback from 1981 to 1982. American Motors lacked the funds to come up with a separate platform for a sub-compact car, so it did something different with an existing model, and \\"although car snobs make fun of the chop-tailed Gremlin, it was a huge sales hit.\\" The authors of the book 365 Cars You Must Drive \\"that any self-respecting auto enthusiast just has to know and experience from the driver's seat\\" describe that \\"driving a Gremlin isn't about the drive; it's about being seen in one, making a statement that you dig the mid-1970s, and also wouldn't be caught dead in something normal.\\" An article published by Time in 2007 included the Gremlin as one of \\"The 50 Worst Cars of All Time\\", describing it as an AMC Hornet with the rear end whacked off, and criticizing its exterior proportions, with a long low snout, long front overhang, and a truncated tail, \\"like the tail snapped off a salamander\\". In 2007, Popular Science magazine included the AMC Gremlin as one of six historic cars that took \\"Small Steps to a Smart Future\\" in a special issue about the \\"Future of the Car: Efficiency\\". =Future U.S. Presidents= Two former U.S. presidents drove AMC Gremlins during their younger days. \\"Bill Clinton drove the back roads of Northwest Arkansas in his green AMC Gremlin\\" during his 1974 campaign for the only attempt he made for a seat in the United States Congress. An AMC Gremlin with a Levi interior was owned by the George H. W. Bush family and driven by George W. Bush in 1973 while getting his Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree.  Collectibility  Scarcity, and the fact that it is a 1970s car, makes the Gremlin collectible, and it has a following among old car hobbyists and collectors of historic vehicles. In some cases, the Gremlin enjoys \\"a cult-like following in today's collectible car market\\". In 2007, Business Week reported that 1970s cars such as the Gremlin were increasingly attractive to buyers, and an insurance provider for collector-car owners reported that values were rising at that time. In light of rising gasoline prices, the Gremlin offers a relatively economical alternative to muscle cars and the more massive American cars of its era- especially for buyers leaning toward the eccentric. AMC said the Gremlin got \\"the best gas mileage of any production car made in America\\", and its gas tank allowed or more between fill-ups. Scarcity makes any Gremlin in good condition worth preserving as a unique piece of automotive history. Original Gremlins with the V8 engine, X package models, Levi's trim, and also the 1978 GT versions, are the most sought-after and command higher prices. By 2019, the cars described as gaining legitimacy as a collector car and a Gremlin winning the Platinum Pick Judge's Award and the Concours Gold awards at the 2018 Muscle Car and Corvette Nationals. Gremlins share numerous parts and components with other AMC models especially service and mechanical replacements are available. There are reproduction parts, but trim pieces for a restoration such as the grille can be more difficult. The Gremlin's original low price and throwaway nature makes good ones fairly scarce today. Many were chopped up during the late 1970s and the 1980s to make dirt-track racers. The body of choice on the dirt circuit was the Gremlin and AMC Eagle. The subcompact bodies fit Modified chassis and of special interest was the Gremlin's slab top and sides with a contour that was easy to duplicate in sheet metal. Over the years, some owners have converted the economy-versions of Gremlins into home-built \\"muscle cars\\" because AMC engines up to the \\"just drop right in\\". =Hot Wheels model= Hot Wheels designer Paul Tam created a \\"bizarre but beautifully rendered model of a six-wheeled AMC Gremlin called Open Fire\\" with the extra pair of wheels under a giant, exposed metal engine. Other than the engine, extra wheels, and elongated hood, \\"the Open Fire retains many accurate styling details of AMC's quirky 1970s econocar. Later on, in the Flying Colors range, Hot Wheels made the Gremlin Grinder: A rear- jacked Gremlin with a huge open engine that was produced through the mid-1970s in either green or chrome. The last one was a stockcar or rally car custom version of the Gremlin that was first made in the early 1980s and is still popular today, \\"The Greased Gremlin\\".

He may have renounced Christianity during Emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians before repenting afterwards, which would explain why he is omitted from lists of martyrs. He is today venerated as a saint in Catholic and Serbian Orthodox Church. Pontificate According to the Liberian Catalogue, Marcellinus was a Roman, the son of Projectus. He succeeded Caius as bishop of Rome on 30 June 296. Marcellinus' pontificate began at a time when Diocletian was Roman emperor, but had not yet started to persecute the Christians. He left Christianity rather free and so the church's membership grew. Caesar Galerius led the pagan movement against Christianity and aroused Diocletian against Christianity in the year 302: first Christian soldiers had to leave the army, later the Church's property was confiscated and Christian books were destroyed. After two fires in Diocletian's palace he took harder measures against Christians: they had either to apostatize or they were sentenced to death. Marcellinus is not mentioned in the Martyrologium hieronymianum, or in the Depositio episcoporum, or in the Depositio martyrum. The Liber Pontificalis, based on the lost Acts of St Marcellinus, relates that during Diocletian‚Äôs persecution Marcellinus was called upon to sacrifice, and offered incense to idols, but that, repenting shortly afterwards, he confessed the faith of Christ and suffered martyrdom with several companions. Other documents speak of his defection, and it is probably this lapse that explains the silence of the ancient liturgical calendars. In the beginning of the 5th century, Petilianus, the Donatist bishop of Cirta, says that Marcellinus and his priests had given up the holy books to the pagans during the persecution and offered incense to false gods. St Augustine denied the affair.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Pope Saint Marcellinus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 28 September 2017 The records of the pseudo-Council of Sinuessa, which were fabricated at the beginning of the 6th century, state that Marcellinus after his fall presented himself before a council, which refused to try him on the ground that prima sedes a nemine iudicatur (\\"The first See is judged by none\\"). According to the Liber Pontificalis, Marcellinus was buried on 26 April 304 in the cemetery of Priscilla, on the Via Salaria, 25 days after his martyrdom; the Liberian Catalogue gives as the date 25 October. The fact of the martyrdom, too, is not established with certainty. After a considerable interregnum, he was succeeded by Marcellus, with whom he has sometimes been confused.  Veneration Marcellinus was mentioned in the General Roman Calendar, into which a feast day in his honour jointly with that of Saint Cletus on 26 April was inserted in the thirteenth century.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p.121 Because of the uncertainties regarding both, this joint feast was removed from that calendar in 1969. Saint Cletus is still listed in the Roman Martyrology under 26 April date; but Saint Marcellinus is no longer mentioned in that professedly incomplete list of recognized saints.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ) Pope Marcellinus, along with Pope Marcellus, is commemorated in the Serbian Prologue of Ohrid on 7 June according to the Julian Calendar.http://www.stnicholasredbank.com/june1-8.htm See also *List of Catholic saints *List of popes Notes External links *Colonnade Statue in St Peter's Square 3rd-century births 304 deaths 3rd-century archbishops 3rd-century Romans 4th-century Christian saints 4th-century Romans Italian popes Papal saints People from Rome Popes Year of birth unknown 3rd-century popes 4th-century popes ","title":"Pope Marcellinus"},{"id":"53360","text":"Porter in the 1930s Cole Albert Porter (June 9, 1891 ‚Äì October 15, 1964) was an American composer and songwriter. Many of his songs became standards noted for their witty, urbane lyrics, and many of his scores found success on Broadway and in film. Born to a wealthy family in Indiana, Porter defied his grandfather's wishes and took up music as a profession. Classically trained, he was drawn to musical theatre. After a slow start, he began to achieve success in the 1920s, and by the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike many successful Broadway composers, Porter wrote the lyrics as well as the music for his songs. After a serious horseback riding accident in 1937, Porter was left disabled and in constant pain, but he continued to work. His shows of the early 1940s did not contain the lasting hits of his best work of the 1920s and 1930s, but in 1948 he made a triumphant comeback with his most successful musical, Kiss Me, Kate. It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter's other musicals include Fifty Million Frenchmen, DuBarry Was a Lady, Anything Goes, Can-Can and Silk Stockings. His numerous hit songs include \\"Night and Day\\", \\"Begin the Beguine\\", \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\", \\"Well, Did You Evah!\\", \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\" and \\"You're the Top\\". He also composed scores for films from the 1930s to the 1950s, including Born to Dance (1936), which featured the song \\"You'd Be So Easy to Love\\"; Rosalie (1937), which featured \\"In the Still of the Night\\"; High Society (1956), which included \\"True Love\\"; and Les Girls (1957). Life and career =Early years= Farmhouse at Westleigh Farms Porter was born in Peru, Indiana, the only surviving child of a wealthy family.Derbyshire, John. \\"Oh, the Songs!\\" , National Review Online, July 28, 2004, accessed May 27, 2010 His father, Samuel Fenwick Porter, was a druggist by trade.Shaftel, Matthew. \\"From Inspiration to Archive: Cole Porter's 'Night and Day'\\", Journal of Music Theory, Duke University Press, Volume 43, No. 2 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 315‚Äì47, accessed March 7, 2011 His mother, Kate, was the indulged daughter of James Omar \\"J. O.\\" Cole, \\"the richest man in Indiana\\", a coal and timber speculator who dominated the family. J. O. Cole built the couple a house on his Peru-area property, known as Westleigh Farms.Schwartz (1977), p. 11 After high school, Porter returned to his childhood home only for occasional visits.Schwartz (1977), p. 18 Porter's strong-willed mother doted on him and began his musical training at an early age. He learned the violin at age six, the piano at eight, and wrote his first operetta (with help from his mother) at ten. She falsified his recorded birth year, changing it from 1891 to 1893 to make him appear more precocious. His father, a shy and unassertive man, played a lesser role in Porter's upbringing, although as an amateur poet, he may have influenced his son's gifts for rhyme and meter. Porter's father was also a talented singer and pianist, but the father-son relationship was not close.McBrien (1998), p. 10. Porter as a Yale College student J. O. Cole wanted his grandson to become a lawyer,Bell, J. X. \\"Cole Porter Biography\\" , The Cole Porter Resource Site, accessed March 7, 2011 and with that in mind, sent him to Worcester Academy in Massachusetts in 1905. Porter brought an upright piano with him to schoolMcBrien (1998), p. 21 and found that music, and his ability to entertain, made it easy for him to make friends. Porter did well in school and rarely came home to visit.McBrien (1998), p. 26 He became class valedictorian and was rewarded by his grandfather with a tour of France, Switzerland and Germany.\\"The Theater: The Professional Amateur\\", Time magazine, January 31, 1949 Entering Yale College in 1909, Porter majored in English, minored in music, and also studied French.Kimball (1999), p. 1. He was a member of Scroll and Key and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, and contributed to campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Seuss (2012), p. 10 He was an early member of the Whiffenpoofs a cappella singing group and participated in several other music clubs;McBrien (1998), p. 32. in his senior year, he was elected president of the Yale Glee Club and was its principal soloist. Porter wrote 300 songs while at Yale, including student songs such as the football fight songs \\"Bulldog\\"\\"Yale Fight Songs\\", Yale Bands, Yale University, accessed February 21, 2020 and \\"Bingo Eli Yale\\" (aka \\"Bingo, That's The Lingo!\\") that are still played at Yale.Schiff, David. \\"One Swell Party\\", The Atlantic, July/August 2004, accessed April 2, 2020Ewen, David. \\"Cole Porter: The Great Sophisticate\\", from The Story of America's Musical Theater, New York, Chilton Company, 1961, pp. 134‚Äì39 During college, Porter became acquainted with New York City's vibrant nightlife, taking the train there for dinner, theater, and nights on the town with his classmates, before returning to New Haven, Connecticut, early in the morning. He also wrote musical comedy scores for his fraternity, the Yale Dramatic Association, and as a student at Harvard ‚Äì Cora (1911), And the Villain Still Pursued Her (1912), The Pot of Gold (1912), The Kaleidoscope (1913) and Paranoia (1914) ‚Äì which helped prepare him for a career as a Broadway and Hollywood composer and lyricist. After graduating from Yale, Porter enrolled in Harvard Law School in 1913. He soon felt that he was not destined to be a lawyer, and, at the suggestion of the dean of the law school, switched to Harvard's music department, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Pietro Yon. His mother did not object to this move, but it was kept secret from J. O. Cole. In 1915, Porter's first song on Broadway, \\"Esmeralda\\", appeared in the revue Hands Up. The quick success was immediately followed by failure: his first Broadway production, in 1916, See America First, a \\"patriotic comic opera\\" modeled on Gilbert and Sullivan, with a book by T. Lawrason Riggs, was a flop, closing after two weeks.Root, Deane L. and Gerald Bordman. \\"Porter, Cole (Albert)\\", Grove Music Online, accessed May 21, 2010 (requires subscription) Porter spent the next year in New York City before going overseas during World War I. =Paris and marriage= In 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Porter moved to Paris to work with the Duryea Relief organization.Kimball (1992), p. 1. Some writers have been skeptical about Porter's claim to have served in the French Foreign Legion, but the Legion lists Porter as one of its soldiers and displays his portrait at its museum in Aubagne. By some accounts, he served in North Africa and was transferred to the French Officers School at Fontainebleau, teaching gunnery to American soldiers.Salazar, Jaime. Legion of the Lost , Legionofthelost.com, 2005, accessed September 16, 2016 An obituary notice in The New York Times stated that, while in the Legion, \\"he had a specially constructed portable piano made for him so that he could carry it on his back and entertain the troops in their bivouacs.\\" Another account, given by Porter, is that he joined the recruiting department of the American Aviation Headquarters, but, according to his biographer Stephen Citron, there is no record of his joining this or any other branch of the forces.Citron (2005), p. 48 Porter maintained a luxury apartment in Paris, where he entertained lavishly. His parties were extravagant and scandalous, with \\"much gay and bisexual activity, Italian nobility, cross-dressing, international musicians and a large surplus of recreational drugs\\". In 1918, he met Linda Lee Thomas, a rich, Louisville, Kentucky-born divorc√©e eight years his senior. She was beautiful and well- connected socially; the couple shared mutual interests, including a love of travel, and she became Porter's confidante and companion.McBrien (1998), p. 70 The couple married the following year. She was in no doubt about Porter's homosexuality, but it was mutually advantageous for them to marry. For Linda, it offered continued social status and a partner who was the antithesis of her abusive first husband.McBrien (1998), p. 65 For Porter, it brought a respectable heterosexual front in an era when homosexuality was not publicly acknowledged. They were, moreover, genuinely devoted to each other and remained married from December 19, 1919, until her death in 1954. Linda remained protective of her social position and, believing that classical music might be a more prestigious outlet than Broadway for her husband's talents, tried to use her connections to find him suitable teachers, including Igor Stravinsky, but was unsuccessful. Finally, Porter enrolled at the Schola Cantorum in Paris, where he studied orchestration and counterpoint with Vincent d'Indy. Meanwhile, Porter's first big hit was the song \\"Old-Fashioned Garden\\" from the revue Hitchy-Koo in 1919. In 1920, he contributed the music of several songs to the musical A Night Out.\\"Cole Porter ‚Äì The Twenties\\", The Stephen Sondheim Reference Guide, accessed February 28, 2011 Ca' Rezzonico in Venice, leased by Porter in the 1920s Marriage did not diminish Porter's taste for extravagant luxury. The Porter home on the rue Monsieur near Les Invalides was a palatial house with platinum wallpaper and chairs upholstered in zebra skin.\\"Obituary: Cole Porter is Dead; Songwriter Was 72\\", The New York Times, October 16, 1964 In 1923, Porter came into an inheritance from his grandfather, and the Porters began living in rented palaces in Venice. He once hired the entire Ballets Russes to entertain his guests, and for a party at Ca' Rezzonico, which he rented for $4,000 a month ($ in current value), he hired 50 gondoliers to act as footmen and had a troupe of tightrope walkers perform in a blaze of lights. In the midst of this extravagant lifestyle, Porter continued to write songs with his wife's encouragement.Kimball (1992), p. 2 Porter received few commissions for songs in the years immediately after his marriage. He had the occasional number interpolated into other writers' revues in Britain and the U.S. For a C. B. Cochran show in 1921, he had two successes with the comedy numbers \\"The Blue Boy Blues\\" and \\"Olga, Come Back to the Volga\\".Citron (2005), p. 58 In 1923, in collaboration with Gerald Murphy, he composed a short ballet, originally titled Landed and then Within the Quota, satirically depicting the adventures of an immigrant to America who becomes a film star.Kimball (1991), pp. 4‚Äì5 The work, written for the Ballets su√©dois, lasts about 16 minutes. It was orchestrated by Charles Koechlin and shared the same opening night as Milhaud's La cr√©ation du monde.Kimball (1991), p. 5 Porter's work was one of the earliest symphonic jazz-based compositions, predating George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue by four months, and was well received by both French and American reviewers after its premiere at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in October 1923. After a successful New York performance the following month, the Ballets su√©dois toured the work in the U.S., performing it 69 times. A year later the company disbanded, and the score was lost until it was reconstructed from Porter's and Koechlin's manuscripts between 1966 and 1990, with help from Milhaud and others.Kimball (1991), p. 6 Porter had less success with his work on The Greenwich Village Follies (1924). He wrote most of the original score, but his songs were gradually dropped during the Broadway run, and by the time of the post- Broadway tour in 1925, all his numbers had been deleted.Kimball (1984), p. 85 Frustrated by the public response to most of his work, Porter nearly gave up songwriting as a career, although he continued to compose songs for friends and perform at private parties. =Broadway and West End success= Ir√®ne Bordoni, star of Porter's Paris At the age of 36, Porter reintroduced himself to Broadway in 1928 with the musical Paris, his first hit.Kimball (1999), p. 5 It was commissioned by E. Ray Goetz at the instigation of Goetz's wife and the show's star, Ir√®ne Bordoni. She had wanted Rodgers and Hart to write the songs, but they were unavailable, and Porter's agent persuaded Goetz to hire Porter instead.Citron (2005), p. 73 In August 1928, Porter's work on the show was interrupted by the death of his father. He hurried back to Indiana to comfort his mother before returning to work. The songs for the show included \\"Let's Misbehave\\" and one of his best-known list songs, \\"Let's Do It\\", which was introduced by Bordoni and Arthur Margetson.Kimball (1984), pp. 101 and 104 The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1928. The Porters did not attend the first night because Porter was in Paris supervising another show for which he had been commissioned, La Revue, at a nightclub.Citron (2005), pp. 74 and 79 This was also a success, and, in Citron's phrase, Porter was finally \\"accepted into the upper echelon of Broadway songwriters\\".Citron (2005), p. 78 Cochran now wanted more from Porter than isolated extra songs; he planned a West End extravaganza similar to Ziegfeld's shows, with a Porter score and a large international cast led by Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale and Tilly Losch. The revue, Wake Up and Dream, ran for 263 performances in London, after which Cochran transferred it to New York in 1929. On Broadway, business was badly affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash, and the production ran for only 136 performances. From Porter's point of view, it was nonetheless a success, as his song \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" became immensely popular.Citron (2005), pp 80‚Äì82 Porter's new fame brought him offers from Hollywood, but because his score for Paramount's The Battle of Paris was undistinguished, and its star, Gertrude Lawrence, was miscast, the film was not a success.Citron (2005), pp. 82‚Äì83 Citron expresses the view that Porter was not interested in cinema and \\"noticeably wrote down for the movies.\\"Citron (2005), p. 83 Still on a Gallic theme, Porter's last Broadway show of the 1920s was Fifty Million Frenchmen (1929), for which he wrote 28 numbers, including \\"You Do Something to Me\\", \\"You've Got That Thing\\" and \\"The Tale of the Oyster\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 117‚Äì29 The show received mixed notices. One critic wrote, \\"the lyrics alone are enough to drive anyone but P. G. Wodehouse into retirement\\", but others dismissed the songs as \\"pleasant\\" and \\"not an outstanding hit song in the show\\". As it was a lavish and expensive production, nothing less than full houses would suffice, and after only three weeks, the producers announced that they would close it. Irving Berlin, who admired and championed Porter, took out a paid press advertisement calling the show \\"The best musical comedy I've heard in years. ... One of the best collections of song numbers I have ever listened to\\". This saved the show, which ran for 254 performances, considered a successful run at the time.Citron (2005), p. 84 =1930s= Ray Goetz, producer of Paris and Fifty Million Frenchmen, the success of which had kept him solvent when other producers were bankrupted by the post-crash slump in Broadway business, invited Porter to write a musical show about the other city that he knew and loved: New York. Goetz offered the team with whom Porter had last worked: Herbert Fields writing the book and Porter's old friend Monty Woolley directing.Citron (2005), p. 100 The New Yorkers (1930) acquired instant notoriety for including a song about a streetwalker, \\"Love for Sale\\". Originally performed by Kathryn Crawford in a street setting, critical disapproval led Goetz to reassign the number to Elisabeth Welch in a nightclub scene. The lyric was considered too explicit for radio at the time, though it was recorded and aired as an instrumental and rapidly became a standard.Citron (2005), p. 101 Porter often referred to it as his favorite of his songs.Kimball (1984), p. 145 The New Yorkers also included the hit \\"I Happen to Like New York\\".Kimball (1984), p. 147 Elisabeth Welch starred in Porter's The New Yorkers and Nymph Errant. Next came Fred Astaire's last stage show, Gay Divorce (1932).\\"Gay Divorce ‚Äì Original Broadway Production\\", Sondheimguide.com, accessed April 16, 2016 It featured a hit that became Porter's best-known song, \\"Night and Day\\". Despite mixed press (some critics were reluctant to accept Astaire without his previous partner, his sister Adele), the show ran for a profitable 248 performances, and the rights to the film, retitled The Gay Divorcee, were sold to RKO Pictures. Porter followed this with a West End show for Gertrude Lawrence, Nymph Errant (1933), presented by Cochran at the Adelphi Theatre, where it ran for 154 performances. Among the hit songs Porter composed for the show were \\"Experiment\\" and \\"The Physician\\" for Lawrence, and \\"Solomon\\" for Elisabeth Welch.Kimball (1984), pp. 158‚Äì62 In 1934, producer Vinton Freedley came up with a new approach to producing musicals. Instead of commissioning book, music and lyrics and then casting the show, Freedley sought to create an ideal musical with stars and writers all engaged from the outset.Citron (2005), p. 108 The stars he wanted were Ethel Merman, William Gaxton and comedian Victor Moore. He planned a story about a shipwreck and a desert island, and for the book he turned to P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. For the songs, he decided on Porter. By telling each of these that he had already signed the others, Freedley gathered his ideal team together. A drastic last-minute rewrite was necessitated by a major shipping accident that dominated the news and made Bolton and Wodehouse's book seem tasteless. Nevertheless, the show, Anything Goes, was an immediate hit. Porter wrote what many consider his greatest score of this period. The New Yorker magazine's review said, \\"Mr. Porter is in class by himself\\",Citron (2005), p. 110 and Porter subsequently called it one of his two perfect shows, along with the later Kiss Me, Kate. Its songs include \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\", \\"All Through the Night\\", \\"You're the Top\\" (one of his best-known list songs), and \\"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\\", as well as the title number.Kimball (1984), pp. 167‚Äì76 The show ran for 420 performances in New York (a particularly long run in the 1930s) and 261 in London.Citron (2005), p. 111 Porter, despite his lessons in orchestration from d'Indy, did not orchestrate his musicals. Anything Goes was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett and Hans Spialek.McGlinn, John (1989), \\"The Original Anything Goes: A Classic Restored\\", Notes to EMI CD CDC 7 49848 2 Now at the height of his success, Porter was able to enjoy the opening night of his musicals; he made grand entrances and sat in front, apparently relishing the show as much as any audience member. Russel Crouse commented \\"Cole's opening-night behaviour is as indecent as that of a bridegroom who has a good time at his own wedding.\\" Anything Goes was the first of five Porter shows featuring Merman. He loved her loud, brassy voice and wrote many numbers that displayed her strengths.Citron (2005), p. 141 Jubilee (1935), written with Moss Hart while on a cruise around the world, was not a major hit, running for only 169 performances, but it featured two songs that have since become standards, \\"Begin the Beguine\\" and \\"Just One of Those Things\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 183‚Äì96 Red, Hot and Blue (1936), featuring Merman, Jimmy Durante and Bob Hope, ran for 183 performances and introduced \\"It's De-Lovely\\", \\"Down in the Depths (on the Ninetieth Floor)\\", and \\"Ridin' High\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 205‚Äì16 The relative failure of these shows convinced Porter that his songs did not appeal to a broad enough audience. In an interview, he said \\"Sophisticated allusions are good for about six weeks ... more fun, but only for myself and about eighteen other people, all of whom are first-nighters anyway. Polished, urbane and adult playwriting in the musical field is strictly a creative luxury.\\"Kimball (1984), p. 205. Porter also wrote for Hollywood in the mid-1930s. His scores include those for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Born to Dance (1936), with James Stewart, featuring \\"You'd Be So Easy to Love\\" and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", and Rosalie (1937), featuring \\"In the Still of the Night\\".Kimball (1992), p. 9 He wrote the score of the short film Paree, Paree, in 1935, using some of the songs from Fifty Million Frenchmen.Paree, Paree, SoundheimGuide, accessed February 13, 2013 Porter also composed the cowboy song \\"Don't Fence Me In\\" for Adios, Argentina, an unproduced movie, in 1934, but it did not become a hit until Roy Rogers sang it in the 1944 film Hollywood Canteen.Kimball (1992), p. 7 Bing Crosby, The Andrews Sisters, and other artists also popularized it in the 1940s. The Porters moved to Hollywood in December 1935, but Porter's wife did not like the movie environment, and Porter's homosexual peccadillos, formerly very discreet, became less so; she retreated to their Paris house.Citron (2005), p. 143McBrien (1998), pp. 189, 193, 206 and 209 When his film assignment on Rosalie was finished in 1937, Porter hastened to Paris to make peace with Linda, but she remained cool. After a walking tour of Europe with his friends, Porter returned to New York in October 1937 without her.McBrien (1998), p. 209. They were soon reunited by an accident Porter suffered.Citron (2005), p. 144 On October 24, 1937, Porter was riding with Countess Edith di Zoppola and Duke Fulco di Verdura at Piping Rock Club in Locust Valley, New York, when his horse rolled on him and crushed his legs, leaving him substantially crippled and in constant pain for the rest of his life. Though doctors told Porter's wife and mother that his right leg would have to be amputated, and possibly the left one as well, he refused to have the procedure. Linda rushed from Paris to be with him, and supported him in his refusal of amputation.Citron (2005), p. 145 He remained in the hospital for seven months before being allowed to go home to his apartment at the Waldorf Towers.Citron (2005), p. 162Harriman, Margaret Case. \\"Words and Music\\", The New Yorker, November 23, 1940, accessed June 17, 2018 He resumed work as soon as he could, finding it took his mind off his perpetual pain. Porter's first show after his accident was not a success. You Never Know (1938), starring Clifton Webb, Lupe V√©lez and Libby Holman, ran for only 78 performances.Kimball (1984), p. 225 The score included the songs \\"From Alpha to Omega\\" and \\"At Long Last Love\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 227 and 229 He returned to success with Leave It to Me! (1938); the show introduced Mary Martin, singing \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\", and other numbers included \\"Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love\\" and \\"From Now On\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 241 and 243 Porter's last show of the 1930s was DuBarry Was a Lady (1939), a particularly risqu√© show starring Merman and Bert Lahr.Citron (2005), p. 184 After a pre- Broadway tour, during which it ran into trouble with Boston censors,Kimball (1984), p. 260 it achieved 408 performances, beginning at the 46th Street Theatre.Kimball (1984), p. 256 The score included \\"But in the Morning, No\\" (which was banned from the airwaves), \\"Do I Love You?\\", \\"Well, Did You Evah!\\", \\"Katie Went to Haiti\\" and another of Porter's up-tempo list songs, \\"Friendship\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 259‚Äì67 At the end of 1939, Porter contributed six songs to the film Broadway Melody of 1940 for Fred Astaire, George Murphy and Eleanor Powell.Kimball (1984), pp. 252‚Äì54 Meanwhile, as political unrest increased in Europe, Porter's wife closed their Paris house in 1939, and the next year bought a country home in the Berkshire mountains, near Williamstown, Massachusetts, which she decorated with elegant furnishings from their Paris home. Porter spent time in Hollywood, New York and Williamstown.McBrien (1998), p. 225 =1940s and postwar= Fred Astaire in You'll Never Get Rich Panama Hattie (1940) was Porter's longest-running hit so far, running in New York for 501 performances despite the absence of any enduring Porter songs.Citron (2005), p. 185 It starred Merman, Arthur Treacher and Betty Hutton. Let's Face It! (1941), starring Danny Kaye, had an even better run, with 547 performances in New York.Kimball (1984), p. 299 This, too, lacked any numbers that became standards, and Porter always counted it among his lesser efforts.Citron (2005), p. 189 Something for the Boys (1943), starring Merman, ran for 422 performances, and Mexican Hayride (1944), starring Bobby Clark, with June Havoc, ran for 481 performances.Kimball (1984), pp. 320 and 343 These shows, too, are short of Porter standards. The critics did not pull their punches, complaining about the lack of hit tunes and the generally low standard of the scores.Citron (2005), p. 190 After two flops, Seven Lively Arts (1944) (which featured the standard \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\") and Around the World (1946), many thought that Porter's best period was over.Citron (2005), p. 193 Between Broadway musicals, Porter continued to write for Hollywood. His film scores of this period were You'll Never Get Rich (1941) with Astaire and Rita Hayworth, Something to Shout About (1943) with Don Ameche, Janet Blair and William Gaxton, and Mississippi Belle (1943‚Äì44), which was abandoned before filming began.Kimball (1984), pp. 295, 313 and 335 He also cooperated in the making of the film Night and Day (1946), a largely fictional biography of Porter, with Cary Grant implausibly cast in the lead. The critics scoffed, but the film was a huge success, chiefly because of the wealth of vintage Porter numbers in it.Citron (2005), pp. 211‚Äì14 The biopic's success contrasted starkly with the failure of Vincente Minnelli's film The Pirate (1948), with Judy Garland and Gene Kelly,Kimball (1992), p. 13‚Äì15 in which five new Porter songs received little attention.Citron (2005), p. 215 Porter and Jean Howard in early 1954 From this low spot, Porter made a conspicuous comeback in 1948 with Kiss Me, Kate. It was by far his most successful show, running for 1,077 performances in New York and 400 in London.Citron (2005), p. 419 The production won the Tony Award for Best Musical (the first Tony awarded in that category), and Porter won for best composer and lyricist. The score includes \\"Another Op'nin', Another Show\\", \\"Wunderbar\\", \\"So In Love\\", \\"We Open in Venice\\", \\"Tom, Dick or Harry\\", \\"I've Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua\\", \\"Too Darn Hot\\", \\"Always True to You (in My Fashion)\\", and \\"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\\".Kimball (1984), pp. 387‚Äì99 Porter began the 1950s with Out of This World (1950), which had some good numbers but too much camp and vulgarity,Citron (2005), p. 220 and was not greatly successful. His next show, Can-Can (1952), featuring \\"C'est Magnifique\\" and \\"It's All Right with Me\\", was another hit, running for 892 performances.Kimball (1984), p. 422 Porter's last original Broadway production, Silk Stockings (1955), featuring \\"All of You\\", was also successful, with a run of 477 performances.Kimball (1984), p. 438 Porter wrote two more film scores and music for a television special before ending his Hollywood career. The film High Society (1956), starring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly, included Porter's last major hit song \\"True Love\\". It was adapted as a stage musical of the same name. Porter also wrote numbers for the film Les Girls (1957), which starred Gene Kelly. His final score was for the CBS television special Aladdin (1958).Kimball (1984), p. 468 =Last years= Porter's mother died in 1952, and his wife died of emphysema in 1954.Citron (2005), pp. 239 and 242 By 1958, Porter's injuries caused a series of ulcers on his right leg. After 34 operations, it had to be amputated and replaced with an artificial limb.Citron (2005), p. 249 His friend No√´l Coward visited him in the hospital and wrote in his diary, \\"The lines of ceaseless pain have been wiped from his face...I am convinced that his whole life will cheer up and that his work will profit accordingly.\\"Coward (1982), p. 379 In fact, Porter never wrote another song after the amputation and spent the remaining six years of his life in relative seclusion, seeing only intimate friends. He continued to live in the Waldorf Towers in New York in his memorabilia-filled apartment. On weekends, he often visited an estate in the Berkshires, and he stayed in California during the summers. Porter died of kidney failure on October 15, 1964, in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 73. He is interred in Mount Hope Cemetery in his native Peru, Indiana, between his wife and father.Schwartz (1977), p. 269 Tributes and legacy Porter family gravesite in Peru, Indiana Many artists have recorded Porter songs, and dozens have released entire albums of his songs.List of Cole Porter collections at Sondheimguide.com, accessed June 9, 2011 In 1956, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald released Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook.

KH-4B Corona satellite Lacrosse radar spy satellite under construction A model of a German SAR-Lupe reconnaissance satellite inside a Cosmos-3M rocket. Rhyolite) A reconnaissance satellite or intelligence satellite (commonly, although unofficially, referred to as a spy satellite) is an Earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications. The first generation type (i.e., Corona and Zenit) took photographs, then ejected canisters of photographic film which would descend back down into Earth's atmosphere. Corona capsules were retrieved in mid-air as they floated down on parachutes. Later, spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via encrypted radio links. In the United States, most information available is on programs that existed up to 1972, as this information has been declassified due to its age. Some information about programs prior to that time is still classified, and a small amount of information is available on subsequent missions. A few up-to-date reconnaissance satellite images have been declassified on occasion, or leaked, as in the case of KH-11 photographs which were sent to Jane's Defence Weekly in 1984.  History  On 16 March 1955, the United States Air Force officially ordered the development of an advanced reconnaissance satellite to provide continuous surveillance of \\"preselected areas of the Earth\\" in order \\"to determine the status of a potential enemy‚Äôs war-making capability\\".  Types  There are several major types of reconnaissance satellite. ;Missile early warning :Provides warning of an attack by detecting ballistic missile launches. Earliest known are Missile Defense Alarm System. ;Nuclear explosion detection :Identifies and characterizes nuclear explosions in space. Vela (satellite) is the earliest known. ;Electronic reconnaissance :Signals intelligence, intercepts stray radio waves. Samos-F is the earliest known. ;Optical imaging surveillance :Provides imaging of earth from space. Images can be a survey or close-look telephoto. Corona (satellite) is the earliest known. Spectral imaging is commonplace. ;Radar imaging surveillance :Most space-based radars use synthetic aperture radar. Can be used at night or through cloud cover. Earliest known are the Soviet US-A series. Missions Examples of reconnaissance satellite missions: * High resolution photography (IMINT) * Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) * Communications eavesdropping (SIGINT) * Covert communications * Monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance (see National Technical Means) * Detection of missile launches On 28 August 2013, it was thought that \\"a $1-billion high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below\\" was launched from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base using a Delta IV Heavy launcher, America's highest-payload space launch vehicle. On 17 February 2014, a Russian Kosmos-1220 originally launched in 1980 and used for naval missile targeting until 1982, made an uncontrolled atmospheric entry. Benefits Reconnaissance satellites have been used to enforce human rights, through the Satellite Sentinel Project, which monitors atrocities in Sudan and South Sudan. During his 1980 State of the Union Address, President Jimmy Carter explained how all of humanity benefited from the presence of American spy satellites: Additionally, companies such as GeoEye and DigitalGlobe have provided commercial satellite imagery in support of natural disaster response and humanitarian missions. During the 1950s, a Soviet hoax had led to American fears of a bomber gap. In 1968, after gaining satellite photography, the United States' intelligence agencies were able to state with certainty that \\"No new ICBM complexes have been established in the USSR during the past year.\\" President Lyndon B. Johnson told a gathering in 1967: In fiction Spy satellites are commonly seen in spy fiction and military fiction.

Born in Sardinia, Nivola had already started his career when he fled Fascism for Paris in 1938, going to the U.S. in 1939. His major sculptural work is abstract, large-scale architectural reliefs in concrete, made in his own sandcasting and cement carving processes. These were erected in and on American buildings between the late 1950s and early 1970s. Creatively busy and while remaining active in Italy, Nivola also taught at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Columbia University, UC Berkeley, and elsewhere. thumbNivola Museum (ph. Armin Linke) The Nivola Museum in Orani, Sardinia is dedicated to his life and sculpture, and hosts the largest collection of his smaller scale work.  Early career  Nivola was born and grew up poor in Orani, a village in Sardinia. As an adolescent, he worked as an apprentice stonemason. In Sassari in 1926, Nivola served as apprentice to fellow painter Mario Delitala, executing frescoes for the aula magna of the local university. In 1931 Nivola enrolled in the ISIA (Istituto superiore per le industrie artistiche, the State Institute of Industrial Arts) in Monza. Through one of his teachers, the architect Giuseppe Pagano, he contributed work to the 1936 Milan Triennial VI and the Italian Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exposition. This drew the attention of Adriano Olivetti, who named him art director of his company's Publicity Department, where Nivola \\"made a significant contribution to... 'the Olivetti style'.  United States  Nivola married fellow ISIA student Ruth Guggenheim in 1938, and left together for the United States via Paris in 1939. He established a home in Greenwich Village (first at Waverly Place, then at No. 47 West Eighth Street) to rebuild a social circle and a career despite speaking no English. Nivola resumed a close friendship with artist Saul Steinberg from Milan, attended meetings of the anti-fascist Italian-American Mazzini Society in 1941, and by the 1940s Nivola was presiding over a weekly gathering of artists at Del Pezzo's restaurant described by as comparable to the Algonquin Round Table. One key friendship was Le Corbusier. Introduced in 1945 by Josep Llu√≠s Sert, Nivola became warm lifelong friends with the Swiss architect, his houseguest on Corbu's rare trips to America. Supported by small exhibitions and a progression of jobs in factories, for Bonwit Teller, and for architectural magazines, the Nivolas bought a modest property in Springs, East Hampton, Long Island. It would expand to 35 acres. Their garden landscape, a series of outdoor rooms and a roofless solarium, was co-designed by the Nivolas and architect Bernard Rudofsky; in 1950 Le Corbusier impulsively painted murals on two walls of their kitchen. On the nearby beach Nivola developed the principle of his distinctive concrete sandcasting technique while playing with his children. They sculpted wet sand, then poured a slurry of plaster or concrete into the form. In 1951 Nivola was one of the artists shown in the pivotal 9th Street Art Exhibition, hung by Leo Castelli. Once more Olivetti provided the sculptor with a major commission, for an interior wall in their stylish Fifth Avenue showroom in 1953. Nivola executed it with a refined, scaled-up version of the beach process, in a sequence of panels. The resulting attention and publicity started a successful career in large-scale architecture work which lasted for decades. One project, involving two thousand and ten cast-concrete panels for the McCormick Place Exposition Center in Chicago in 1959, was touted as the largest such installation ever. In 1954 Nivola was named to direct the Design Workshop at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he stayed until 1957. He was also visiting professor or artist in residence at Columbia University (1961), Harvard (1970 and 1973), Dartmouth (1978), UC Berkeley (1978‚Äì79 and 1982), and the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague (1982). The American Institute of Graphic Arts awarded him its Certificate of Excellence. In 1972 the American Academy of Arts and Letters admitted Nivola as its first non-American member. Nivola died of a heart attack in Southampton Hospital, Long Island, in May 1988. He was the father of children's book author Claire Nivola, and the grandfather of actor Alessandro Nivola. A foundation and museum dedicated to Nivola's work opened in his hometown in 1995, in a building partly designed by architect Peter Chermayeff.

He was widely known as a \\"saviour of children,\\" as diphtheria used to be a major cause of child death. The Immune System: In Defence of our Lives, nobelprize.org He was honored with Prussian nobility in 1901, henceforth being known by the surname \\"von Behring.\\" Biography Behring was born in Hansdorf, Kreis Rosenberg, Province of Prussia (now ≈Åawice, I≈Çawa County, Poland). His father was a schoolmaster; the family had 13 children. Between 1874 and 1878, he studied medicine at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Akademie in Berlin, an academy for military doctors, since his family could not afford the university. As a military doctor, he studied the action of iodoform. In 1888, he became an assistant at the institute of Robert Koch in Berlin. In 1890 he published an article with Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç reporting that they had developed \\"antitoxins\\" against both diphtheria and tetanus. They had injected diphtheria and tetanus toxins into guinea-pigs, goats and horses; when these animals developed immunity, they derived antitoxins (now known to consist of antibodies) from their serum. These antitoxins could protect against and cure the diseases in non-immunized animals. In 1892 he started the first human trials of the diphtheria antitoxin, but they were unsuccessful. Successful treatment started in 1894, after the production and quantification of antitoxin had been optimized. During 1894, Behring was also awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. In 1895 he became Professor of Hygienics within the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Marburg, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. He and the pharmacologist Hans Horst Meyer had their laboratories in the same building, and Behring stimulated Meyer's interest in the mode of action of tetanus toxin. Behring won the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for the development of serum therapies against diphtheria. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1902. In 1904 he founded the Behringwerke in Marburg, a company to produce antitoxins and vaccines. At the International Tuberculosis Congress in 1905 he announced that he had discovered \\"a substance proceeding from the virus of tuberculosis.\\" This substance, which he designated \\"T C,\\" plays the important part in the immunizing action of his \\"bovivaccine\\", which prevents bovine tuberculosis. He tried unsuccessfully to obtain a protective and therapeutic agents for humans.Emil von Behring Serum Therapy in Therapeutics and Medical Science. Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1901. nobelprize.org Laboratory of 1913 in the Wannkopfstra√üe in Marburg Behring died at Marburg, Hessen-Nassau, on 31 March 1917. His name survived in the Dade Behring organisation (now part of the Siemens Heathineers), in CSL Behring, a manufacturer of plasma-derived biotherapies, in Novartis Behring and in the Emil von Behring Prize of the University of Marburg, the highest endowed medicine award in Germany. His Nobel Prize medal is now kept on display at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva. =Controversy= Von Behring is believed to have cheated Paul Ehrlich out of recognition and financial reward in relation to collaborative research in diphtheria. The two men developed a diphtheria serum by repeatedly injecting the deadly toxin into a horse. The serum was used effectively during an epidemic in Germany. A chemical company preparing to undertake commercial production and marketing of the diphtheria serum offered a contract to both men, but von Behring maneuvered to claim all the considerable financial rewards for himself. To add insult to injury, only Behring received the first Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1901, for his contributions. However, Ehrlich would go on to win the 1908 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his contribution to immunology.

The bombing of Tokyo in World War II cut the city's industrial productivity by half and killed around 100,000 civilians. Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale, its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. One of the strategies of war is to demoralize the enemy so that peace or surrender becomes preferable to continuing the conflict. Strategic bombing has been used to this end. The phrase \\"terror bombing\\" entered the English lexicon towards the end of World War II and many strategic bombing campaigns and individual raids have been described as terror bombing by commentators and historians. Because the term has pejorative connotations, some, including the Allies of World War II, have preferred to use euphemisms such as \\"will to resist\\" and \\"morale bombings\\". quoting the Singleton Report The theoretical distinction between tactical and strategic air warfare was developed between the two world wars. Some leading theorists of strategic air warfare during this period were the Italian Giulio Douhet, the Trenchard school in the United Kingdom, and General Billy Mitchell in the United States. These theorists were highly influential, both on the military justification for an independent air force (such as the Royal Air Force) and in influencing political thoughts on a future war as exemplified by Stanley Baldwin's 1932 comment that the bomber will always get through. Enemy morale One of the aims of war is to demoralize the enemy; facing continual death and destruction may make the prospect of peace or surrender preferable. The proponents of strategic bombing between the world wars, such as General Douhet, expected that direct attacks upon an enemy country's cities by strategic bombers would lead to a rapid collapse of civilian morale so that political pressure to sue for peace would lead to a rapid conclusion. When such attacks were tried in the 1930s‚Äîin the Spanish Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War‚Äîthey were ineffective. Commentators observed the failures and some air forces, such as the Luftwaffe, concentrated their efforts upon direct support of the troops. The term \\"terror bombing\\"  Terror bombing is an emotive term used for aerial attacks planned to weaken or break enemy morale. Use of the term to refer to aerial attacks implies the attacks are criminal according to the law of war, or if within the laws of war are nevertheless a moral crime. According to John Algeo in Fifty Years among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms 1941‚Äì1991, the first recorded usage of \\"Terror bombing\\" in a United States publication was in a Reader's Digest article dated June 1941, a finding confirmed by the Oxford English Dictionary. \\"Terror Bombing. Bombing designed to hasten the end of the war by terrorising the enemy population ‚Äì 1941 Read. Dig. June p. 58/2 ...\\"Oxford English Dictionary, terror,n, \\"terror-bombing, intensive and indiscriminate bombing designed to frighten a country into surrender; terror raid, a bombing raid of this nature\\". Aerial attacks described as terror bombing are often long range strategic bombing raids, although attacks which result in the deaths of civilians may also be described as such, or if the attacks involve fighters strafing they may be labelled \\"terror attacks\\". (mentions that Historian Ronald Shaffer described Operation Clarion, an operation that involved both bombing and strafing, as a terror attack). German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and other high-ranking officials of the Third Reich frequently described attacks made on Germany by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) during their strategic bombing campaigns as Terrorangriffe‚Äîterror attacks. Goebbels used several terms including The Allied governments usually described their bombing of cities with other euphemisms such as area bombing (RAF) or precision bombing (USAAF), and for most of World War II the Allied news media did the same. However, at a SHAEF press conference on 16 February 1945, two days after the bombing of Dresden, British Air Commodore Colin McKay Grierson replied to a question by one of the journalists that the primary target of the bombing had been on communications to prevent the Germans from moving military supplies and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroy \\"what is left of German morale.\\" Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, filed a story about the Dresden raid. The military press censor at SHAEF made a mistake and allowed the Cowan cable to go out starting with \\"Allied air bosses have made the long awaited decision to adopt deliberate terror bombing of great German population centers as a ruthless expedient to hasten Hitler's doom.\\" There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a longtime opponent of strategic bombing, Richard Stokes, MP, asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March. The controversy stirred up by the Cowan news report reached the highest levels of the British Government when on 28 March 1945 the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, sent a memo by telegram to General Ismay for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff in which he started with the sentence \\"It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed....\\"Siebert, Detlef. \\"British Bombing Strategy in World War Two\\", 1 August 2001, BBC Under pressure from the Chiefs of Staff and in response to the views expressed by Chief of the Air Staff Sir Charles Portal, and the head of Bomber Command, Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris, among others, Churchill withdrew his memo and issued a new one. This was completed on 1 April 1945 and started instead with the usual British euphemism for attacks on cities: \\"It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of the so called 'area-bombing' of German cities should be reviewed from the point of view of our own interests....\\". Many strategic bombing campaigns and individual raids of aerial warfare have been described as \\"terror bombing\\" by commentators and historians since the end of World War II, but because the term has pejorative connotations, others have denied that such bombing campaigns and raids are examples of \\"terror bombing\\". Defensive measures Defensive measures against air raids include: * attempting to shoot down attackers using fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns or surface-to-air missiles * the use of air raid shelters to protect the population * air raid sirens * employment of Air Raid Wardens * setting up organizations like the British ARP (Air Raid Precautions) * Blackouts ‚Äì extinguishing all lights at night to make bombing less accurate History and origins =World War I= A 1918 Air Raid rehearsal, evacuating children from a hospital. Strategic bombing was used in World War I, though it was not understood in its present form. The first bombing of a city was on the night of 24‚Äì25 August 1914, when eight bombs were dropped from a German airship onto the Belgian city of Antwerp. The first effective strategic bombing was pioneered by the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in 1914. The mission was to attack the Zeppelin production lines and their sheds at Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. Led by Charles Rumney Samson the force of four aircraft inflicted minor damage on the sheds. The raid was repeated a month later with slightly more success. Within a year or so, specialized aircraft and dedicated bomber squadrons were in service on both sides. These were generally used for tactical bombing; the aim was that of directly harming enemy troops, strongpoints, or equipment, usually within a relatively small distance of the front line. Eventually, attention turned to the possibility of causing indirect harm to the enemy by systematically attacking vital rear-area resources. The most well known attacks were those done by Zeppelins over England through the course of the war. The first aerial bombardment of English civilians was on January 19, 1915, when two German Zeppelins dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110-pound) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three-kilogram incendiaries on the Eastern England towns of Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn, and the surrounding villages. In all, four people were killed and sixteen injured, and monetary damage was estimated at ¬£7,740 (about US$36,000 at the time). German airships also bombed on other fronts, for example in January 1915 on LiepƒÅja in Latvia. German airship bombing Calais on the night of 21‚Äì22 February 1915 In 1915 there were 19 more raids, in which 37 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 181 people and injuring 455. Raids continued in 1916. London was accidentally bombed in May, and in July the Kaiser allowed directed raids against urban centers. There were 23 airship raids in 1916, in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved. In 1917 and 1918, there were only 11 Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on August 5, 1918, which resulted in the death of KK Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358. These raids caused only minor hampering of wartime production, by later standards. A much greater impact was the diversion of twelve aircraft squadrons, many guns, and over 10,000 men to air defenses. The raids generated a wave of hysteria, partially caused by media. This revealed the tactic's potential as a weapon that was of use for propagandists on both sides. The late Zeppelin raids were complemented by the Gotha bomber, which was the first heavier-than-air bomber to be used for strategic bombing. The French army on June 15, 1915, attacked the German town of Karlsruhe, killing 29 civilians and wounding 58. Further raids followed until the Armistice in 1918. In a raid in the afternoon of June 22, 1916, the pilots used outdated maps and bombed the location of the abandoned railway station, where a circus tent was placed, killing 120 persons, most of them children. The British also stepped up their strategic bombing campaign. In late 1915, the order was given for attacks on German industrial targets, and the 41st Wing was formed from units of the RNAS and Royal Flying Corps. The RNAS took to the strategic bombing in a bigger way than the RFC, who were focused on supporting the infantry actions of the Western Front. At first, the RNAS attacked the German submarines in their moorings and then steelworks further in targeting the origin of the submarines themselves. In early 1918 they operated their \\"round the clock\\" bombing raid, with lighter bombers attacking the town of Trier by day and large HP O/400s attacking by night. The Independent Force, an expanded bombing group, and the first independent strategic bombing force, was created in April 1918. By the end of the war, the force had aircraft that could reach Berlin, but these were never used. =Interbellum= Following the war, the concept of strategic bombing developed. Calculations of the number of dead to the weight of bombs would have a profound effect on the attitudes of the British authorities and population in the interwar years. As bombers became larger, it was fully expected that deaths would dramatically increase. The fear of aerial attack on such a scale was one of the fundamental driving forces of British appeasement in the 1930s. These early developments of aerial warfare led to two distinct branches in the writings of air warfare theorists: tactical air warfare and strategic air warfare. Tactical air warfare was developed as part of a combined-arms attack which would be developed to a significant degree by Germany, and which contributed much to the success of the Wehrmacht during the first four years (1939‚Äì42) of World War II. The Luftwaffe became a major element of the German blitzkrieg. Some leading theorists of strategic air warfare, namely strategic bombing during this period were the Italian Giulio Douhet, the Trenchard school in Great Britain, and General Billy Mitchell in the United States. These theorists thought that aerial bombardment of the enemy's homeland would be an important part of future wars. Not only would such attacks weaken the enemy by destroying important military infrastructure, they would also break the morale of the civilian population, forcing their government to capitulate. Although area bombing theorists acknowledged that measures could be taken to defend against bombers‚Äîusing fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery‚Äîthe maxim of the times remained \\"the bomber will always get through\\". These theorists for strategic bombing argued that it would be necessary to develop a fleet of strategic bombers during peacetime, both to deter any potential enemy, and also in the case of a war, to be able to deliver devastating attacks on the enemy industries and cities while suffering from relatively few friendly casualties before victory was achieved.Richard Overy, The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940‚Äì1945 (2014) ch 1 In the period between the two world wars, military thinkers from several nations advocated strategic bombing as the logical and obvious way to employ aircraft. Domestic political considerations saw to it that the British worked harder on the concept than most. The British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service of the Great War had been merged in 1918 to create a separate air force, which spent much of the following two decades fighting for survival in an environment of severe government spending constraints. In Italy, the airpower prophet General Giulio Douhet asserted the basic principle of strategic bombing was the offensive, and there was no defense against carpet bombing and poison gas attacks. The seeds of Douhet's apocalyptic predictions found fertile soil in France, Germany, and the United States, where excerpts from his book The Command of the Air (1921) were published. These visions of cities laid waste by bombing also gripped the popular imagination and found expression in novels such as Douhet's The War of 19 (1930) and H.G. Wells's The Shape of Things to Come (1933) (filmed by Alexander Korda as Things to Come (1936)).Jeremy Black, The Second World War: Causes and Background (2007) p. 392 Douhet's proposals were hugely influential among air force enthusiasts, arguing as they did that the bombing air arm was the most important, powerful, and invulnerable part of any military. He envisaged future wars as lasting a matter of a few weeks. While each opposing Army and Navy fought an inglorious holding campaign, the respective Air Forces would dismantle their enemies' country, and if one side did not rapidly surrender, both would be so weak after the first few days that the war would effectively cease. Fighter aircraft would be relegated to spotting patrols but would be essentially powerless to resist the mighty bombers. In support of this theory, he argued for targeting of the civilian population as much as any military target, since a nation's morale was as important a resource as its weapons. Paradoxically, he suggested that this would actually reduce total casualties, since \\"The time would soon come when to put an end to horror and suffering, the people themselves, driven by the instinct of self-preservation, would rise up and demand an end to the war...\\". As a result of Douhet's proposals, air forces allocated greater resources to their bomber squadrons than to their fighters, and the 'dashing young pilots' promoted in the propaganda of the time were invariably bomber pilots. Royal Air Force leaders, in particular Air Chief Marshal Hugh Trenchard, believed the key to retaining their independence from the senior services was to lay stress on what they saw as the unique ability of a modern air force to win wars by unaided strategic bombing. As the speed and altitude of bombers increased in proportion to fighter aircraft, the prevailing strategic understanding became \\"the bomber will always get through\\". Although anti- aircraft guns and fighter aircraft had proved effective in the Great War, it was accepted there was little warring nations could do to prevent massive civilian casualties from strategic bombing. High civilian morale and retaliation in kind were seen as the only answers‚Äîa later generation would revisit this, as Mutual Assured Destruction. During the interwar period (1919‚Äì1939), the use of aerial bombing was developed as part of British colonial policy, with Hugh Trenchard as its leading proponent, Sir Charles Portal, Sir Arthur Harris, and Sidney Bufton. The Trenchard School theories were successfully put into action in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) where RAF bombers used high-explosive bombs and strafing against guerrilla forces. The techniques of so-called \\"Air Control\\" included also target marking and locating, as well as formation flying. Arthur Harris, a young RAF squadron commander (later nicknamed \\"Bomber\\"), reported after a mission in 1924, \\"The Arab and Kurd now know what real bombing means, in casualties and damage. They know that within 45 minutes a full-sized village can be practically wiped out and a third of its inhabitants killed or injured\\". Despite such statements, in reality, RAF forces took great care when striking at targets. RAF directives stressed: A statement clearly pointed out that the ability of aircraft to inflict punishment could be open to abuse: In strikes over Yemen in over a six-month period, sixty tons of bombs were dropped in over 1,200 hours of flying. By August 1928, total losses in ground fighting and air attack, on the Yemeni side, were 65 killed or wounded (one RAF pilot was killed and one airman wounded). Between the wars the RAF conducted 26 separate air operations within the Aden Protectorate. The majority were conducted in response to persistent banditry or to restore the Government's authority. Excluding operations against Yemeni forces‚Äîwhich had effectively ceased by 1934‚Äîa total of twelve deaths were attributed to air attacks conducted between 1919 and 1939. Bombing as a military strategy proved to be an effective and efficient way for the British to police their Middle East protectorates in the 1920s. Fewer men were required as compared to ground forces. Pre-war planners, on the whole, vastly overestimated the damage bombers could do, and underestimated the resilience of civilian populations. Jingoistic national pride played a major role: for example, at a time when Germany was still disarmed and France was Britain's only European rival, Trenchard boasted, \\"the French in a bombing duel would probably squeal before we did\\".Johnson, History of Air Fighting. At the time, the expectation was any new war would be brief and very savage. A British Cabinet planning document in 1938 predicted that, if war with Germany broke out, 35% of British homes would be hit by bombs in the first three weeks. This type of expectation might justify the appeasement of Hitler in the late 1930s. Ruins of Guernica (1937) During the Spanish Civil War, the bombing of Guernica by German aviators including the Condor Legion, under Nationalist command, resulted in its near destruction. Casualties were estimated to be between 500 and 1500. Though this figure was relatively small, aerial bombers and their weaponry were continually improving‚Äîalready suggesting the devastation that was to come in the near future. Yet the theory that \\"the bomber will always get through\\" started to appear doubtful, as stated by the U.S. Attach√© in 1937, \\"The peacetime theory of the complete invulnerability of the modern type of bombardment airplane no longer holds. The increased speeds of both the bombardment and pursuit plane have worked in favor of the pursuit ... The flying fortress died in Spain.\\" Large scale bombing of the civilian population, thought to be demoralizing to the enemy, seemed to have the opposite effect. Dr. E. B. Strauss surmised, \\"Observers state that one of the most remarkable effects of the bombing of open towns in Government Spain had been the welding together into a formidable fighting force of groups of political factions who were previously at each other's throats...\\", a sentiment with which Hitler's Luftwaffe, supporting the Spanish Nationalists, generally agreed.Air Power by Stephen Budiansky, Viking Penguin Books 2004, pp. 200‚Äì08 =World War II= The strategic bombing conducted in World War II was unlike any before. The campaigns conducted in Europe and Asia could involve aircraft dropping thousands of tons of conventional bombs or a nuclear weapon over a single city. Area bombardment came to prominence during World War II with the use of large numbers of unguided gravity bombs, often with a high proportion of incendiary devices, to bomb the target region indiscriminately‚Äîto kill war workers, destroy materiel, and demoralize the enemy. In high enough concentration, it was capable of producing a firestorm.Harris, Arthur Bomber Offensive (First edition Collins 1947) Pen & Sword military classics 2005; The high explosives were often delay-action bombs intended to kill or intimidate those fighting the fires caused by incendiaries. Destroyed townhouses in Warsaw after the German Luftwaffe bombing of the city, September 1939 At first this required multiple aircraft, often returning to the target in waves. Nowadays, a large bomber or missile can be used to the same effect on a small area (an airfield, for example) by releasing a relatively large number of smaller bombs. Strategic bombing campaigns were conducted in Europe and Asia. The Germans and Japanese made use of mostly twin-engined bombers with a payload generally less than , and never produced larger craft to any great extent. By comparison, the British and Americans (who started the war with predominantly similarly sized bombers) developed their strategic force based upon much larger four-engined bombers for their strategic campaigns. The payload carried by these planes ranged from for the B-17 Flying Fortress on long-range missions, to for the B-24 Liberator, for the Avro Lancaster, and B-29 Superfortress,\\"The bombload of the B-29 eventually reached \\" with some specialized aircraft, such as the 'Special B' Avro Lancaster carrying the Grand Slam. During the first year of the war in Europe, strategic bombing was developed through trial and error. The Luftwaffe had been attacking both civilian and military targets from the very first day of the war, when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. A strategic-bombing campaign was launched by the Germans as a precursor to the invasion of the United Kingdom to force the RAF to engage the Luftwaffe and so be destroyed either on the ground or in the air. That tactic failed, and the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940. After the Battle of Britain, the Germans launched their night time Blitz hoping to break British morale and to have the British be cowed into making peace. At first the Luftwaffe raids took place in daylight, but changed to night bombing attacks when losses became unsustainable. The RAF, who had preferred precision bombing, also switched to night bombing, also due to excessive losses. Before the Rotterdam Blitz on 14 May 1940 the British restricted themselves to tactical bombing west of the Rhine and naval installations. The day after the Rotterdam Blitz a new directive was issued to the RAF to attack targets in the Ruhr, including oil plants and other civilian industrial targets which aided the German war effort, such as blast furnaces that at night were self-illuminating. After the Butt Report (released in September 1941) proved the inadequacy of RAF Bomber Command training methods and equipment, the RAF adopted an area-attack strategy, by which it hoped to impede Germany's war production, her powers of resistance (by destroying resources and forcing Germany to divert resources from her front lines to defend her air space), and her morale.Conclusion to the Singleton report 20 May 1942 . The RAF dramatically improved its navigation so that on average its bombs hit closer to target.British Bombing Survey Unit, The strategic air war against Germany, 1939‚Äì1945: report of the British Bombing Survey Unit (reprint 1998) ch 9 online Accuracy never exceeded a radius from point of aim in any case.Hastings, Bomber Command USAAF raid on ball bearing works at Schweinfurt, Germany The United States Army Air Forces adopted a policy of daylight precision bombing for greater accuracy as, for example, during the Schweinfurt raids. That doctrine, based on the erroneous supposition that bombers could adequately defend themselves against air attack, entailed much higher American losses until long-range fighter escorts (e.g. the Mustang) became available. Conditions in the European theatre made it very difficult to achieve the accuracy achieved using the exceptional and top-secret Norden optical bombsight in the clear skies over the desert bombing ranges of Nevada and California. Raids over Europe commonly took place in conditions of very poor visibility, with targets partly or wholly obscured by thick cloud, smokescreens, or smoke from fires started by previous raids. As a result, bomb loads were regularly dropped \\"blind\\" using dead-reckoning methods little different from those used by the RAF night bombers. In addition, only the leading bomber in a formation actually utilized the Norden sight, the rest of the formation dropping their bombs only when they saw the lead aircraft's bombload falling away. Since even a very tight bomber formation could cover a vast area, the scatter of bombs was likely to be considerable. Add to these difficulties the disruptive effects of increasingly accurate anti-aircraft fire and head-on attacks by fighter aircraft and the theoretical accuracy of daylight bombing was often hard to achieve.Stewart Ross, Strategic bombing by the United States in World War II: the myths and the facts (2003) pp. 8, 52, 129‚Äì40Stephen L. McFarland, America's pursuit of precision bombing, 1910‚Äì1945 (1995) Accuracy, described as \\"pinpoint\\", never exceeded the best British average of about a radius from point of aim in any case. Postwar German engineers considered the bombing of railways, trains, canals, and roads more harmful to production than attacks on factories themselves, Sir Roy Fedden (in his report on a postwar British scientific intelligence mission) calling it \\"fatal\\" and saying it reduced aero-engine production by two thirds (from a high of 5,000 to 7,000 a month).Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), pp. 77, 100. Strategic bombing was a way of taking the war into Europe while Allied ground forces were unable to do so. Between them, Allied air forces claimed to be able to bomb \\"around the clock\\". In fact, few targets were ever hit by British and American forces the same day, the strategic isolation of Normandy on D-Day and the bombing of Dresden in February 1945 being exceptions rather than the rule. There were generally no coordinated plans for the around-the-clock bombing of any target. In some cases, single missions have been considered to constitute strategic bombing. The British bombing of Peenem√ºnde was such an event, as was the bombing of the Ruhr dams. The Peenem√ºnde mission delayed Nazi Germany's V-2 program enough that it did not become a major factor in the outcome of the war. Strategic bombing in Europe never reached the decisive completeness the American campaign against Japan achieved, helped in part by the fragility of Japanese housing, which was particularly vulnerable to firebombing through the use of incendiary devices. The destruction of German infrastructure became apparent, but the Allied campaign against Germany only really succeeded when the Allies began targeting oil refineries and transportation in the last year of the war. At the same time, the strategic bombing of Germany was used as a morale booster for the Allies in the period before the land war resumed in Western Europe in June 1944. London, 1945 In the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service frequently used strategic bombing over Singaporean, Burmese, and Chinese cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Chongqing, Singapore, and Rangoon. However, the Japanese military in most places advanced quickly enough that a strategic bombing campaign was unnecessary, and the Japanese aircraft industry was incapable of producing truly strategic bombers in any event. In those places where it was required, the smaller Japanese bombers (in comparison to British and American types) did not carry a bombload sufficient to inflict the sort of damage regularly occurring at that point in the war in Europe, or later in Japan. The development of the B-29 gave the United States a bomber with sufficient range to reach the Japanese home islands from the safety of American bases in the Pacific or western China. The capture of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima further enhanced the capabilities that the Americans possessed in their strategic bombing campaign. High-explosive and incendiary bombs were used against Japan to devastating effect, with greater indiscriminate loss of life in the firebombing of Tokyo on March 9/10, 1945 than was caused either by the Dresden mission, or the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Unlike the USAAF's strategic bombing campaign in Europe, with its avowed (if unachievable) objective of precision bombing of strategic targets, the bombing of Japanese cities involved the deliberate targeting of residential zones from the outset. Bomb loads included very high proportions of incendiaries, with the intention of igniting the highly combustible wooden houses common in Japanese cities and thereby generating firestorms. The final development of strategic bombing in World War II was the use of nuclear weapons. On August 6 and 9, 1945, the United States exploded nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing 105,000 people and inflicting a psychological shock on the Japanese nation. On August 15, Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, stating: > \\"Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the > power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable, taking the toll of many > innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, it would not only result in an > ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation but also it would > lead to the total extinction of human civilization. Such being the case, how > are We to save the millions of Our subjects; or to atone Ourselves before > the hallowed spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors? This is the reason why We > have ordered the acceptance of the provisions of the Joint Declaration of > the Powers.\\" =Cold War= F-100C practices a nuclear bombing run. Nuclear weapons defined strategic bombing during the Cold War. The age of the massive strategic bombing campaign had come to an end. It was replaced by more devastating attacks using improved sighting and weapons technology. Strategic bombing by the Great Powers also became politically indefensible. The political fallout resulting from the destruction being broadcast on the evening news ended more than one strategic bombing campaign. In the Korean War, the United States Air Force (USAF) at first conducted only tactical attacks against strategic targets. Because it was widely considered a limited war, the Truman Administration prohibited the USAF to bomb near the borders of China and the Soviet Union in fear of provoking the countries to enter into the war. The Chinese intervention in the war in November 1950 changed the aerial bombing policy dramatically. In response to the Chinese intervention, the USAF carried out an intensive bombing campaign against North Korea to demoralize the North Koreans and inflict as much economic cost to North Korea in order to reduce their ability to wage war. The extensive bombing raids on North Korea continued until the armistice agreement was signed between communist and UN forces on July 27, 1953. In the Vietnam War, the strategic bombing of North Vietnam in Operation Rolling Thunder could have been more extensive, but fear by the Johnson Administration of the entry of China into the war led to restrictions on the selection of targets, as well as only a gradual escalation of intensity. The aim of the bombing campaign was to demoralize the North Vietnamese, damage their economy, and reduce their capacity to support the war in the hope that they would negotiate for peace, but it failed to have those effects. The Nixon Administration continued this sort of limited strategic bombing during the two Operation Linebacker campaigns. Images such as that of Kim Phuc Phan Thi (although this incident was the result of close air support rather than strategic bombing) disturbed the American public enough to demand a stop to the campaign. Due to this, and the ineffectiveness of carpet bombing (partly because of a lack of identifiable targets), new precision weapons were developed. The new weapons allowed more effective and efficient bombing with reduced civilian casualties. High civilian casualties had always been the hallmark of strategic bombing, but later in the Cold War, this began to change. Strategic bombing was entering a new phase of high-intensity attacks, specifically targeting factoriesthat take years to build and enormous investment capital. =Post‚ÄìCold War= Smoke in Novi Sad, Serbia after NATO bombardment Strategic bombing in the post‚ÄìCold War era is defined by American advances in and the use of smart munitions. The developments in guided munitions meant that the Coalition forces in the First Gulf War were able to use them, although the majority‚Äî93%Francisco Javier Guis√°ndez G√≥mez, a colonel of the Spanish Air Force, ICRC: \\"The Law of Air Warfare\\" International Review of the Red Cross no 323, pp. 347‚Äì63‚Äîof bombs dropped in that conflict were still conventional, unguided bombs. More frequently in the Kosovo War, and the initial phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom of 2003, strategic bombing campaigns were notable for the heavy use of precision weaponry by those countries that possessed them. Although bombing campaigns were still strategic in their aims, the widespread area bombing tactics of World War II had mostly disappeared. This led to significantly fewer civilian casualties associated with previous bombing campaigns, though it has not brought about a complete end to civilian deaths or collateral property damage.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national- security/story-of-how-a-kunduz-hospital-was-shelled-by-us-gunship-in- question/2015/10/10/1c8affe2-6ebc-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html Additionally, strategic bombing via smart munitions is now possible through the use of aircraft that have been considered traditionally tactical in nature such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon or F-15E Strike Eagle, which had been used during Operation Desert Storm, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom to destroy targets that would have required large formations of strategic bombers during World War II.

Russia's Georgia Take-Down: Implications for Russia and America Aerial bombardment and international law Air warfare must comply with laws and customs of war, including international humanitarian law by protecting the victims of the conflict and refraining from attacks on protected persons. These restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike the war on land and at sea‚Äîwhich is specifically covered by rules such as the 1907 Hague Convention and Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines‚Äîthere are no treaties specific to aerial warfare. To be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: military necessity, distinction, and proportionality: An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.Jefferson D.

In the various Star Trek television series and movies, they are noted for their attempt to live by logic and reason with as little interference from emotion as possible. Known for their pronounced eyebrows and pointed ears, they originate from the fictional planet Vulcan. In the Star Trek universe, they were the first extraterrestrial species to make contact with humans. The most famous actor to portray a Vulcan is Leonard Nimoy, who first played the character Mr. Spock (picture shown at right) in Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969). \\"Pointy ears\\", the \\"Vulcan salute\\" (hand gesture) and the \\"Vulcan nerve pinch\\" are aspects of this fictional race that have entered popular culture. Development The Vulcan, Spock, first appeared in the original 1965 Star Trek pilot, \\"The Cage\\", shown to studio executives. Show creator Gene Roddenberry revealed in 1964 that he wanted an alien as part of the ship's crew, but knew that budget restraints would limit make-up choices. He chose actor Leonard Nimoy because of his \\"high Slavic cheekbones and interesting face\\" and \\"with those cheekbones some sort of pointed ear might go well.\\" Nimoy later commented that Roddenberry felt the presence of an alien would \\"establish that we were in the 23rd century and that interplanetary travel was an established fact.\\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history- star-trek-180958779/ Vulcan salute Blessing gesture he said was the inspiration for the Vulcan salute The Vulcan salutation is a hand gesture consisting of a raised hand with the palm forward and the thumb extended, while the fingers are parted between the middle and ring finger. Typically, the phrase \\"Live long and prosper\\" is uttered when making the salute. An appropriate reply would be to return the gesture and utter either, \\"Live long and prosper\\" or \\"Peace and long life\\". Biology =Physical characteristics= Vulcans are depicted as similar in appearance to humans, as budget constraints in The Original Series did not allow for elaborate make- up.https://screenrant.com/star-trek-alien-races-completely-changed/ All Vulcans have arched and upswept eyebrows and pointy ears. Caucasoid actors portraying Vulcans are given a greenish hue to their skin.https://newrepublic.com/article/136634/star-trek-almost-failed-launch A Vulcan's on-screen blood is green due to copper-based hemocyanin. Vulcans are said to possess an inner eyelid, or nictitating membrane, which protects their vision from bright light.Star Trek TOS \\"Operation: Annihalate\\"Star Trek: Enterprise Ep83 \\"The Forge\\" In addition, their heart is located on the right side of the torso, between the ribs and pelvis; as Dr. McCoy once says about Spock after the Vulcan has been shot through the chest: \\"Lucky his heart's where his liver should be, or he'd be dead now.\\"ST:TOS, \\"A Private Little War\\" =Diet= Vulcans are vegetarians by choice and were omnivores in ages past.In the Star Trek original series (TOS) episode \\"All Our Yesterdays\\", Spock willingly consumes meat; partly as a result of the effects of time travel 5,000 years into the past. Vulcans are repeatedly stated to be herbivorous in the TAS episode \\"The Slaver Weapon\\", by the carnivorous Kzinti. It is a Vulcan custom for guests in the home to prepare meals for their hosts.Star Trek: Enterprise episode: \\"Home\\" Vulcans are said to not drink alcohol, though they are often depicted as doing so.Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Repression\\", humans and Vulcans are shown drinking a Vulcan alcoholic drink called \\"Vulcan Brandy\\". In the TOS episode \\"The Enterprise Incident\\", as part of his diversionary role during an espionage mission against the Romulans, Spock shares a drink known as Romulan ale with the female Romulan commander. In a later TOS episode \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\", Spock specifically requests a Saurian brandy after Dr. McCoy, while serving himself and Captain Kirk, observes that he had no expectation that Spock would be joining them in a drink for fear that the alcohol would affect his logic faculties. Spock claims that he wants a brandy because he is experiencing an unaccustomed envy for his host's artwork. In Star Trek: First Contact, when the Vulcans first meet Zefram Cochrane, Cochrane serves them alcoholic beverages, which they take in lieu of dancing. In an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Quark alludes to Vulcans becoming inebriated by ingesting chocolate.Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode? offers a Vulcan client some Vulcan Port or chocolate An episode of Star Trek: Voyager mentions that Vulcan coffee is poisonous to humans. =Mating drive= Every seven years, Vulcan males and females experience an overpowering hormone imbalance known as pon farr. Once triggered, a Vulcan must have sexual intercourse with someone or the chemical imbalance may cause insanity, loss of self-control, and death.Star Trek:TOS \\"Amok Time\\" Despite popular opinion, TOS writer and story editor, Dorothy C. Fontana, insists that pon farr is not the only time that Vulcans feel sexual desire or engage in sexual activity: > Vulcans mate normally any time they want to. However, every seven years you > do the ritual, the ceremony, the whole thing. The biological urge. You must, > but any other time is any other emotion‚Äîhumanoid emotion‚Äîwhen you're in > love.

The violence ends the pon farr infection,T'Pol in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Bounty\\" \\"shock\\",in the TOS episode \\"Amok Time\\", Spock believed he had killed James T. Kirk, his \\"best friend\\", thus providing sufficient shock to nullify the effects of pon farr and simulation.When he experienced pon farr, Tuvok of the USS Voyager made use of a holodeck simulation of a temporary mate that resembled his wife =Other characteristics= Vulcans are typically depicted as stronger, faster, and longer-lived than humans.TOS \\"This Side of Paradise\\" There are instances of them living over two hundred and twenty years.Star Trek: The Next Generation S3E23 \\"Sarek\\" Having evolved on a desert world, Vulcans can survive without water for longer periods than humans. Vulcans can also go without sleep for as long as two weeks.Star Trek: Voyager S6E22 Psychology =Emotion= Vulcans are known as logical beings who have removed emotions from their daily lives. The Vulcan character, Spock, struggles with this throughout the original series as he is half-human. T'Pol states that paranoia and homicidal rage were common on Vulcan before the adoption of Surak's code of emotional control. Not all Vulcan characters follow the path of pure logic; some instead choose to embrace emotions. A group of renegade Vulcans who believed in this was encountered in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Fusion\\", while Spock's half-brother Sybok, seen in the film Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, was also fully emotional. An episode of Enterprise titled \\"E¬≤\\" featured an elderly T'Pol in an alternative timeline who had embraced emotion and allowed her half-human son, Lorian, to do likewise. While most Vulcans do not express emotions, they still have them. Only those who follow the discipline of kolinahr have completely purged all emotions from their minds; most Vulcans still have emotions, yet do not express or release them. Spock, in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, attempts to achieve kolinahr, but ultimately fails to do so. In the 1st pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\", Spock showed much more emotion. For the 2nd pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", Number One - Spock's superior officer, who showed little emotion - was removed, and it was decided that Spock would take on those traits.Roddenberry \\"The Making of Star Trek\\" 1967 =Telepathy= Vulcans are telepaths. Beginning in the original series, the character Spock was able to \\"mind meld\\" (see below) by touching another being and share thoughts.\\"Dagger of the Mind\\" and \\"Devil in the dark\\" Vulcans have also displayed telepathy at great distance and through walls.\\"The Immunity Syndrome\\", \\"A Taste of Armageddon\\", and \\"By Any Other Name\\" Mind melds A mind meld is a technique for sharing thoughts, experiences, memories, and knowledge with another individual, essentially a limited form of telepathy. It usually requires physical contact with a subject, though instances of mind melds without contact have been seen.the episode \\"By Any Other Name\\" When first depicted in the TOS episode \\"Dagger of the Mind\\", the procedure was said to require several moments of intense concentration and preparation. However, subsequent episodes show contact between minds occurring almost immediately.e.g. Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series) Although most often seen done with humanoids, mind melds can be performed with members of other species.the Earth humpback whale in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the horta in The Devil in the Dark Spock even once successfully mind melded with a machineThe Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series) and was able to establish telepathic contact with the mechanical probe V'ger.Star Trek: The Motion Picture Mind melds can be used both to erase and restore memories; Spock performs each of these on Captain Kirk during TOS 's third season.TOS episode \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\"TOS episode \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\" A mind meld was even used to rejoin Spock's katra (see below) with his physical body.Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Mind melds can also allow more than one mind to experience memories and sensations, and sometimes even interact with the memories.Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Flashback (Star Trek: Voyager)\\" Some species are able to resist mind melds.The quad-lobed brain structure of Ferengi make them unable to be telepathically read by other species, and with sufficient training and mental discipline, high-level Cardiassian military personnel and/or agents of the Obsidian Order are able to resist mind melds used to extract information. For example, when Gul Dukat was captured by the Maquis, he successfully resisted a prolonged mind meld attempt from a female Vulcan Maquis member, much to the latter's frustration Katra Vulcans are able to implant their \\"katra\\" into another person via a mind meld just before death. Sarek explained to Kirk that Spock's katra was \\"his essence, everything that was not of the body, his katra, his living spirit...everything that he was, everything that he knew\\". He further explained that this transference was \\"the Vulcan way, when the body's end is near.\\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock Dr Julian Bashir in the DS9 episode \\"The Passenger\\" referred to this phenomenon as \\"synaptic pattern displacement\\". The ENT Season 4 trilogy of episodes (\\"The Forge\\", \\"Awakening\\", and \\"Kir'Shara\\") reveal some of the history of mind-melding and the journey of the katra of Surak to modern times. Katras can be returned to the body. Such was the case with Spock, who, near the end of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, implanted his katra into the mind of Dr. McCoy before sacrificing his life. In Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, a mind meld ritual, the \\"fal tor pan\\" (\\"re-fusion\\"), removed the katra from McCoy and implanted it into Spock's regenerated body. Culture =Language= Vulcans have their own fictional language in the Star Trek universe. Several words are heard throughout the various television series starting with the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Amok Time\\". Words and dialogue are heard in the feature films Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Linguist Marc Okrand is credited for creating the Vulcan spoken language for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. As in most of the films, the actors filmed their lines in English which was later dubbed with the Vulcan translation.According to Robert Wise's commentary in the Director's edition DVD, it was Gene Roddenberry's idea to have the Vulcans speak their own language. [Wise, Robert. Star Trek: The Motion Picture Directors Edition [Disc 1]. Special features: Commentary] The translation into Vulcan was made by actor James Doohan. Doohan observed the actors' lip movements and created new vocal \\"sounds\\" for them to dub over their original English. According to the DVD commentary of the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirstie Alley, portraying Spock and Saavik respectively, also spoke their lines in English, and later dubbed in Vulcan that corresponded with the movements of their mouths in the scene. =Names= The treatment of Vulcan names has been erratic throughout Star Treks production history. Early on, female Vulcans were typically given names beginning with \\"T\\" followed by an apostrophe then a \\"p\\". The earliest reference to Vulcan names following a set pattern dates back to a May 3, 1966 memo from TOS producer Robert H. Justman to Gene Roddenberry (later reprinted in the book The Making of Star Trek) in which Justman recommended that all Vulcan names begin with \\"SP\\" and end with \\"K\\", and have exactly five letters. (It is clear from the context of the book, however, that the memo was intended as a joke, as the series of memos ends up discussing the pronunciation of such names as \\"Spook\\", \\"Spilk\\" and \\"Spork\\".) Only non-canonical sources have provided any Vulcans with family names, which are usually spoken of as defying attempts at both human pronunciation, especially with English-language phonemes, and human typesetting, especially with the characters of the modern Latin alphabet used for the English language. Hence, no canonical source has given any family names to any Vulcan characters, and indeed, every one of the personal names previously mentioned are all officially described as being only Latin-alphabetical and English- phonetic approximations of the real ones. In the TOS episode \\"This Side of Paradise\\" Spock is asked if he has another name, to which he replies, \\"You couldn't pronounce it.\\" =Marriage= Vulcans practice arranged marriage, in which a male and a female are bonded as children, with consummation at a later date. Spock explains that this childhood pairing has no one-for-one human analogue, as it is considered less than a full \\"marriage\\", but more than simply a \\"betrothal\\". This is why Spock first described T'Pring as his \\"wife\\", before later explaining that this was an incorrect approximation. Following adult union, it is customary for the couple to remain on Vulcan for at least one Vulcan year before conducting off-world travel, though it is possible to defer this requirement until a later date, upon negotiation with the male's family. The state of pon farr is not required for marriage to occur. A Vulcan female can challenge the proposed bonding by calling for \\"koon-ut-kal-if-fee\\", meaning \\"marriage or challenge\\", in which a challenger for marriage engages the bonded male in a fight to the death. Alternatively, the bonded male has the option of rejecting his intended bride and choosing another. It is acceptable for a male to \\"release\\" his mate from marriage (effectively the same as a divorce).Sussman, Michael and Bormanis, Andre. Star Trek: Enterprise, Episode 4/12, \\"Babel One.\\" First aired January 28, 2005. It is not established whether females have the same option, and T'Pring stated in \\"Amok Time\\" that a koon-ut-kal-if-fee challenge was the only way she could legally divorce Spock. While most Vulcan marriages are arranged in childhood, adult Vulcans who have no mates may also declare the \\"koon-ut-so-lik\\", the ritual Vulcan marriage proposal. As with arranged marriages, the Vulcan being proposed to, may accept or challenge the union. =Family= It is customary for Vulcan children to undertake an initiation ordeal known as the \\"Kahs-wan\\" (sometimes spelled Kaswahn), in which they are left to fend for themselves in the desert for a specific period of time. Not all children survive this rite of passage. T'Pol underwent the ritual, while Tuvok experienced a variation known as the \\"tal'oth\\". The Kahs-wan was first introduced in the Star Trek: The Animated Series episode \\"Yesteryear\\", in which Spock's experience as a child was detailed. Contrary to the Vulcan image of expressing no emotion, family bonds can be strong and affectionate just as they are for humans. Tuvok expressed his love for his wife on a few occasions (without actually using the term), Sarek openly expressed affection for both his human wives, and a clear bond of love existed between T'Pol and her mother, T'Les. The bond between Spock and his adopted sister, Michael Burnham, is a central theme of the Star Trek: Discovery second season. =Fighting and self-defense= In the TOS episode, \\"The Savage Curtain\\", Surak explains to Kirk Vulcan's history of violence and the turn to peace that saved their civilization. He tells Kirk that he will not fight. Spock says that he has fought, and will fight again, but that he, too, is a \\"Vulcan, bred to peace.\\" Vulcan nerve pinch Vulcans exhibit a technique known as the \\"Vulcan nerve pinch\\" or \\"neck pinch\\", which targets a location on the neck between the head and the shoulder that renders the victim unconscious. The pinch was first seen in the TOS episode, \\"The Naked Time\\". The mechanics of the pinch have never been explained. While practiced mainly by Vulcans, it is apparently not exclusive to their race. Jonathan Archer and Jean-Luc Picard both use the technique after becoming involved in Vulcan telepathic rituals (Archer holding the katra of Surak, Picard having undergone a mind-meld with Sarek). Seven of Nine is depicted as capable of using this ability in the episode of Voyager, \\"The Raven\\". The android Data also displayed this ability in the TNG episode, \\"Unification, Part II\\". In Star Trek: Discovery, Micheal Burnham does the nerve pinch on Captain Philippa Georgiou and commits mutiny. The neck pinch itself (referred to in scripts as 'FSNP', or 'Famous Spock Neck Pinch') was created by Leonard Nimoy, who objected to a scene in \\"The Enemy Within\\", in which a transporter malfunction had divided Kirk between his good and evil selves, that required Spock to render the \\"evil\\" Kirk unconscious and subduing him by hitting him over the head with the butt of a phaser. Nimoy was convinced that such overt violence, in addition to being too similar to that found in many crime dramas of the time, was uncharacteristic of the strictly-logical Spock, and suggested the neck pinch as a less-emotional alternative. =IDIC= A graphic representation of a Kol-Ut-Shan pendant symbolizing IDIC In Star Trek, the IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations) has become a symbol of Vulcan equality philosophy. It is symbolized by the \\"Kol-Ut-Shan\\", a pendant of yellow and white gold with a circle and triangle resting upon each other, and adorned with a white jewel in the center. The Vulcan IDIC pendant was designed by Gene Roddenberry as a marketing premium to be sold through mail order to Star Trek fans. As early as the end of the first season, fans of the show had begun writing the studio asking for copies of the scripts, film clip frames, etc., and these were soon sold through Roddenberry's mail order company, Lincoln Enterprises.Harlan Ellison mentions the Trimbles as founders of the business and their eventual ouster in favor of Barrett in his book The City on the Edge of Forever (Open Road, 2014). As evidenced in some of his letters and memos, Roddenberry was fond of circle-and-triangle designs and had wanted to use them as early as the first season's \\"The Return of the Archons\\". As reported by Inside Star Trek editor Ruth Berman, \\"ardent rock hound and amateur lapidary\\" Roddenberry came up with the Vulcan philosophy after he presented Leonard Nimoy with a unique hand-crafted piece of jewelry, a pendant of a polished yellow gold circle and a florentined white gold triangle with a stone of brilliant white fabulite ‚Äî an artificial gem \\"developed by the laser industry and used in space mechanisms for its optical qualities\\", and thus well-suited as a gift for an actor in a science fiction show. Readers were encouraged to submit their interest in such a product to Lincoln Enterprises mail order firm. It was noted that less expensive materials would keep costs down.(issue #1, Inside Star Trek, July 1968, pp. 15‚Äì16) According to William Shatner in Star Trek Memories, IDIC was only worked into the episode \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\" as an afterthought. The actors all knew it was a mere advertising toy. Reportedly, Leonard Nimoy was asked to wear it and refused, so it was passed on to Shatner; when he also refused, Nimoy reluctantly agreed to wear it. At the last minute, Roddenberry sent down several pages of new script for the dinner scene, in which Spock was to give a long-winded explanation of the philosophy. The actors refused to film it until Roddenberry cut it down. In an issue of The Humanist, Majel Barrett claimed that the philosophy of \\"Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations\\" was based on the teachings of Rabbi Maimonides.Roddenberry, Majel B. \\"The Legacy of Star Trek\\" The Humanist 55(4): 9‚Äì11. July 1995 Although its origins are rooted in marketing and sales, the IDIC became a theme writers and set designers have used in most of the Star Trek franchise. Spock wore the symbol during important gatherings and ceremonies as part of his dress uniform. After appearing for the first time in the TOS episode, \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\", it appeared in Spock's quarters in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. In the series Star Trek: Enterprise, T'Pol is given an IDIC pendant from her mother T'Les, she holds an IDIC pendant in \\"Terra Prime\\" while she is in mourning for her dying child, and in the episode \\"The Andorian Incident\\" the IDIC symbol appears on small playing pieces that are being used to construct a map of the P'Jem catacombs. In the DS9 episode \\"Take Me Out to the Holosuite\\", Captain Solok and his Vulcan team, the Logicians, wear ball caps featuring the IDIC symbol. Homeworld The fictional Vulcan homeworld, also named Vulcan, was visited several times in the Star Trek series and feature films. The inhabitants are known as \\"Vulcans\\" or \\"Vulcanians\\". First seen in the TOS episode, \\"Amok Time\\", Vulcan is an arid world with a thinner atmosphere than Earth. McCoy states upon beaming down, \\"Hot as Vulcan, now I understand what that phrase means.\\" In the TOS episode, \\"The Man Trap\\", while Uhura is attempting to make conversation with Spock, he informs her that Vulcan has no moon. In several non-canon works, Vulcan is within the triple star system 40 Eridani, and is less than 17 light-years from Earth. In the 2009 film Star Trek, an alternate timeline is created in which Vulcan is destroyed by a Romulan ship. By the time of Star Trek Into Darkness a Vulcan colony had been established named \\"New Vulcan\\". History Vulcans once practiced a form of polytheism; this can be seen in gods of war, peace, and death depicted on the Stone of Gol relic in the TNG episode, \\"Gambit (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\\". The DVD commentary for \\"Amok Time\\" says that TOS writer D. C. Fontana named the Vulcan god of death \\"Shariel\\", a bust of whom is seen in Spock's quarters. Vulcan civilization is ancient. In \\"Amok Time\\", Spock says that the place of \\"Koon-ut-kal-if-fee\\" has been held by his family for 2,000 years. In the TOS episode, \\"The Savage Curtain\\" the image of Surak speaks of a time when Vulcan war nearly destroyed them, before logic was embraced as a way of life. In 1957, the launch of Sputnik I, Earth's first artificial satellite, was observed by a Vulcan vessel that subsequently crashed on the planet, marooning several crew members for a number of months in Carbon Creek, Pennsylvania; the humans were unaware of the alien nature of their guests. On April 5, 2063, Vulcans and humans made official first contact near the town of Bozeman, Montana, following the successful test of Earth scientist Zefram Cochrane's first warp-capable starship.Star Trek: First Contact In 2097, the Vulcans annexed the Andorian planetoid Weytahn and renamed it Pan Mokar. In 2105, the Vulcans and the Andorians agreed to a compromise over Weytahn/Pan Mokar. Still, tensions continued due to the threat of mutual annihilation. By the 22nd century, the Vulcan High Command is a form of military government that controls both the Vulcan space fleet and most of the planet itself. Most Vulcans, including T'Pol, from Star Trek: Enterprise obey the High Command. It is dissolved in the early fourth season of Star Trek: Enterprise. In 2151, Sub-Commander T'Pol joined the crew of the Earth Starfleet vessel Enterprise (NX-01), within a couple of weeks setting a Vulcan endurance record for serving aboard a human vessel. In 2154, T'Pol became a commissioned officer with Starfleet. Throughout the period of Star Trek: Enterprise, the High Command's actions were the themes of several episodes. Vulcan starships were sent to spy on the Enterprise and report on the ship's activities.\\"Breaking the Ice\\" They appeared to participate in open acts of persecution towards other Vulcans, such as isolating and quarantining victims of Pa'nar Syndrome rather than treating them; prejudicial acts against any Vulcan proven to have committed a mind meld; and hunting down and capturing, sometimes killing, members of the underground dissident group, the Syrranites. In 2154, V'Las, the head of the High Command and undercover agent for the Romulans, bombed the United Earth embassy on Vulcan in an attempt to frame and eliminate all Syrranites while simultaneously attempting an invasion of Andoria. He was foiled by the crew of the Enterprise. During these events, the Kir'Shara, a device containing the original writings of Surak, was discovered by Jonathan Archer. This led to the prompt dissolution of the High Command and a reevaluation of Vulcan traditional values. It also resulted in Vulcan agreeing to stop \\"looking over Earth's shoulder\\" in space exploration matters. It was revealed to viewers that the High Command's illogical and often emotionally based actions were, in reality, the result of covert Romulan influence. The Romulans had secretly made contact with V'Las and attempted to reunify their long-lost peoples. After the invasion of Andoria was foiled, the High Command was disbanded and V'Las was dismissed from his post. Subsequently, the altered political climate on Vulcan caused the undercover Romulan operative Talok to leave Vulcan, apparently ending the infiltration. On August 12, 2161, Vulcan became one of the founding members of the United Federation of Planets. In the time of Star Trek: Enterprise, Vulcans are seen to be arrogant and cold in their behavior towards humans. Soval, Vulcan's ambassador to Earth, appeared particularly distrustful of humans, and was often at odds with Archer and his crew. Soval later justified this behavior in the fourth season episode \\"The Forge\\": > 'We don't know what to do about humans. Of all the species we've made > contact with, yours is the only one we can't define. You have the arrogance > of Andorians, the stubborn pride of Tellarites. One moment you're as driven > by your emotions as Klingons, and the next, you confound us by suddenly > embracing logic\\" Soval also explained that, since Earth recovered from World War III far more quickly than Vulcan did from its equivalent (in \\"The Forge\\" and its sequel episodes, it is said that Vulcans took almost a thousand years to fully rebuild their society after their last catastrophic war), it alarmed many Vulcans, who were confused as to how to deal with a rapidly growing and emotional society such as Earth's. After the overthrow of the corrupt Vulcan High Command and the death of Admiral Maxwell Forrest, who sacrificed his life to save Soval from a terrorist attack, the attitudes of Soval, and Vulcan society in general, became more cordial and accepting towards humanity. =Star Trek (2009) alternate timeline= In the alternate timeline of the 2009 film, the planet Vulcan is destroyed in 2258 by the Romulan known as Nero, who had time traveled from the future. Using his space mining vessel, Narada, Nero created a singularity in Vulcan's planetary core as part of his quest to avenge the destruction of Romulus that Spock failed to save. The resulting implosion destroyed Vulcan, killing most of its six billion inhabitants. Only around 10,000 managed to escape. At the end of the film, Spock Prime tells the younger Spock a suitable planet has been located to establish a colony for the surviving Vulcans; this world is named \\"New Vulcan\\".in the sequel Star Trek Into Darkness See also * Stoicism * Vulcan, Alberta‚Äîa town in Canada that has incorporated Star Trek themes due to its name * Vulcan (hypothetical planet) References External links *Official Star Trek website Fictional elements introduced in 1966 Fictional humanoids Fictional telepaths Star Trek species ","title":"Vulcan (Star Trek)"},{"id":"53382","text":"Camillo Golgi (; 7 July 184321 January 1926) was an Italian biologist and pathologist known for his works on the central nervous system. He studied medicine at the University of Pavia (where he later spent most of his professional career) between 1860 and 1868 under the tutelage of Cesare Lombroso. Inspired by pathologist Giulio Bizzozero, he pursued research in the nervous system. His discovery of a staining technique called black reaction (sometimes called Golgi's method or Golgi's staining in his honour) in 1873 was a major breakthrough in neuroscience. Several structures and phenomena in anatomy and physiology are named for him, including the Golgi apparatus, the Golgi tendon organ and the Golgi tendon reflex. Golgi and the Spanish biologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal were jointly given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906 \\"in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system\\". Biography Camillo Golgi was born on 7 July 1843 in the village of Corteno, in the province of Bergamo at that time (Lombardy), Italy. The village is now named Corteno Golgi in his honour. His father Alessandro Golgi was a physician and district medical officer, originally from Pavia. In 1860, he entered the University of Pavia to study medicine, and earned his medical degree in 1865. He did an internship at the San Matteo Hospital (now IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation). During his internship he briefly worked as a civil physician in the Italian Army, and as assistant surgeon at the Novara Hospital (now Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Maggiore della Carit√† di Novara). At the same time he was also involved in the medical team for investigating cholera epidemic in villages around Pavia. In 1867, he resumed his academic study under the supervision of Cesare Lombroso. Lombroso was a renowned scientist in medical psychology such as genius, madness and criminality. Inspired by Lombroso, Golgi wrote a thesis on the etiology of mental disorders, from which he obtained his M.D. in 1868. He became more interested in experimental medicine, and started attending the Institute of General Pathology headed by Giulio Bizzozero. Three years his junior, Bizzozero was an eloquent teacher and experimenter, who specialised in histology of the nervous system and the properties of bone marrow. The most important research publications of Golgi were directly or indirectly influenced by Bizzozero. The two became so close that they lived in the same building; and Golgi later married Bizzozero's niece, Lina Aletti. By 1872, Golgi was an established clinician and histopathologist. He, however, had no opportunity as a tenured professor in Pavia to pursue teaching and research in neurology. Financial pressure prompted him to join the Hospital of the Chronically Ill (Pio Luogo degli Incurabili) in Abbiategrasso, near Milan, as Chief Medical Officer in 1872. To continue research, he set up a simple laboratory on his own in a refurbished hospital kitchen, and it was there that he started making his most notable discoveries. His major achievement was the development of staining technique for nerve tissue called the black reaction (later the Golgi's method). He published his major works between 1875 and 1885 in the journal Rivista sperimentale di Freniatria e di medicina legale. In 1875, he joined the faculty of histology at the University of Pavia. In 1879, he was appointed Chair of Anatomy at the University of Siena. But the next year, he returned to the University of Pavia as full Professor of histology. From 1879 he also became Professor of General Pathology as well as Honorary Chief (Primario ad honorarem) at the San Matteo Hospital. He served as Rector of the University of Pavia twice, first between 1893 and 1896, and second between 1901 and 1909. During the First World War (1914‚Äì1917), he directed the military hospital Collegio Borrmeo at Pavia. He retired in 1918 and continued to research in his private laboratory till 1923. He died on 21 January 1926. =Personal life= Golgi and his wife Lina Aletti had no children, and they adopted Golgi's niece Carolina. Golgi was irreligious in his later life and became an agnostic atheist. One of his former students attempted an unsuccessful deathbed conversion on him.Paolo Mazzarello; Henry A. Buchtel; Aldo Badiani (1999). The hidden structure: a scientific biography of Camillo Golgi. Oxford University Press. p. 34. . It was probably during this period that Golgi became agnostic (or even frankly atheistic), remaining for the rest of his life completely alien to the religious experience.Rapport, Richard L. Nerve Endings: The Discovery of the Synapse. New York: W.W. Norton, 2005. Print. Contributions =Black reaction or Golgi's staining= The first illustration by Golgi of the nervous system. Vertical section of the olfactory bulb of a dog (in 1875). Central nervous system was difficult to study during Golgi's time because the cells were hard to identify. The available tissue staining techniques were useless for studying nervous tissue. While working as chief medical officer at the Hospital of the Chronically Ill, he experimented with metal impregnation of nervous tissue, using mainly silver (silver staining). In early 1873, he discovered a method of staining nervous tissue that would stain a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. He first treated the tissue with potassium dichromate to harden it, and then with silver nitrate. Under the microscope, the outline of the neuron became distinct from the surrounding tissue and cells. The silver chromate precipitate, as a reaction product, selectively stains only some cellular components randomly, sparing other cell parts. The silver chromate particles create a stark black deposit on the soma (nerve cell body) as well as on the axon and all dendrites, providing an exceedingly clear and well-contrasted picture of neuron against a yellow background. This makes it easier to trace the structure of the nerve cells in the brain for the first time. Since cells are selective stained in black, he called the process la reazione nera (\\"the black reaction\\"), but today it is called Golgi's method or the Golgi stain. On 16 February 1873, he wrote to his friend Niccol√≤ Manfredi: His discovery was published in the Gazzeta Medica Italiani on 2 August 1873. =Nervous system= Drawing by Camillo Golgi of a hippocampus stained with the silver nitrate method. In 1871, a German anatomist Joseph von Gerlach postulated that the brain is a complex \\"protoplasmic network\\", in the form of a continuous network called the reticulum. Using his black reaction, Golgi could trace various regions of the cerebro-spinal axis, clearly distinguishing the different nervous projections, namely axon from the dendrites. He drew up a new classification of cells on the basis of the structure of their nervous prolongation. He described an extremely dense and intricate network, composed of a web of intertwined branches of axons coming from different cell layers (\\"diffuse nervous network\\"). This network structure, which emerges from the axons, is essentially different from that hypothesized by Gerlach. It was the main organ of the central nervous system according to Golgi. Thus, Golgi presented the reticular theory which states that the brain is a single network of nerve fibres, and not of discrete cells. Although Golgi's earlier works between 1873 and 1885 clearly depicted the axonal connections of cerebellar cortex and olfactory bulb as independent of one another, his later works including the Nobel Lecture showed the entire granular layer of the cerebellar cortex occupied by a network of branching and anastomosing nerve processes. This was due to his strong conviction in the reticular theory. Golgi's theory was challenged by Ram√≥n y Cajal, who used the same technique developed by Golgi. According to Ram√≥n y Cajal's neurone theory, the nervous system is but a collection of individual cells, the neurones, which are interconnected to form a network. In addition to this, Golgi was the first to give clear descriptions of the structure of the cerebellum, hippocampus, spinal cord, olfactory lobe, as well as striatal and cortical lesions in a case of chorea. In 1878, he also discovered a receptor organ that senses changes in muscle tension, and is now known as Golgi tendon organ or Golgi receptor; and Golgi- Mazzoni corpuscles (pressure transductors). He further developed a stain specific for myelin (a specialised portion of axon) using potassium dichromate and mercuric chloride. Using this he discovered the myelin annular apparatus, often called the horny funnel of Golgi-Rezzonico. =Kidney= Golgi studied kidney function during 1882 to 1889. In 1882, he published his observations on the mechanism of renal hypertrophy, which he understood to be due to renal cell proliferation. In 1884, he described tubular cell mitoses in the kidney of a person suffering from tubulointerstitial nephritis, and he noted that the process was an essential part of repairing the kidney tissue. He was the first to dissect out intact nephrons, and show that the distal tubulus (loop of Henle) of the nephron returns to its originating glomerulus, a finding that he published in 1889 (\\"Annotazioni intorno all'Istologia dei reni dell'uomo e di altri mammifieri e sull'istogenesi dei canalicoli oriniferi\\". Rendiconti R. Acad. Lincei 5: 545‚Äì557, 1889). =Malaria= A French Army physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that malaria was caused by microscopic parasite (now called Plasmodium falciparum) in 1880. But scientists were sceptical until Golgi intervened. It was Golgi who helped him prove that malarial parasite was a microscopic protozoan. From 1885, Golgi studied the malarial parasite and its transmission. He established two types of malaria, tertian and quartan fevers caused by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae respectively. In 1886, he discovered that malarial fever (paroxysm) was produced by the asexual stage in the human blood (called erythocytic cycle, or Golgi cycle). In 1889‚Äì1890, Golgi and Ettore Marchiafava described the differences between benign tertian malaria and malignant tertian malaria (the latter caused by P. falciparum). By 1898, along with Giovanni Battista Grassi, Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli, Angelo Celli and Marchiafava, he confirmed that malaria was transmitted by Anopheline mosquito. =Cell organelle= An organelle in eukaryotice cells now known as Golgi apparatus or Golgi complex, or sometimes simply as Golgi, was discovered by Camillo Golgi. Golgi modified his black reaction using osmium dichromate solution with which he stained the nerve cells (Purkinje cells) of the cerebellum of an owl. He noticed thread-like networks inside the cells and named them apparato reticolare interno (internal reticular apparatus). Recognising them to be unique cellular components, he presented his discovery before the Medical- Surgical Society of Pavia in April 1898. After the same was confirmed by his assistant Emilio Veratti, he published it in the Bollettino della Societ√† medico-chirurgica di Pavia. However, most scientists disputed his discovery as nothing but a staining artefact. Their microscopes were not powerful enough to identify the organelles. By the 1930s, Golgi's description was largely rejected. It was only firmly established after 50 years of its discovery, when electron microscopes were developed. Awards and legacy Golgi, together with Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for his studies of the structure of the nervous system. In 1900 he was named senator by King Umberto I.GOLGI Camillo. Italian senate website In 1913 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge, University of Geneva, Kristiania University College, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and Paris-Sorbonne University. In 1994, the European Community commemorated him with postage stamps. = Monuments in Pavia = Marble statue of Golgi at the University of Pavia In Pavia several landmarks stand as Golgi's memory. * A marble statue, in a yard of the old buildings of the University of Pavia, at N.65 of the central \\"Strada Nuova\\".

Dziemianowicz, \\"Beaumont, Charles\\" in David Pringle, ed., St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998. (pp. 37-39). He is remembered as a writer of classic Twilight Zone episodes, such as \\"The Howling Man\\", \\"Static\\", \\"Miniature\\", \\"Printer's Devil\\", and \\"Number Twelve Looks Just Like You\\", but also penned the screenplays for several films, among them 7 Faces of Dr. Lao, The Intruder, and The Masque of the Red Death. Novelist Dean Koontz has said, \\"Charles Beaumont was one of the seminal influences on writers of the fantastic and macabre.\\" Beaumont is also the subject of the documentary, Charles Beaumont: The Short Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man, by Jason V Brock. Life and work Beaumont was born Charles Leroy Nutt in Chicago, the only child of Charles Hiram Nutt (an auditor of freight accounts for the Chicago & Alton Railroad) and Violet \\"Letty\\" (Phillips) Nutt, a homemaker who had been a scenarist at Essanay Studios. His father was 56 when Charles was born; Letty, his mother, was 22 years her husband's junior. Letty is known to have dressed young Charles in girls' clothes, and once threatened to kill his dog to punish him. These early experiences inspired the celebrated short story \\"Miss Gentilbelle\\", but according to Beaumont, \\"Football, baseball, and dimestore cookie thefts filled my early world\\". School did not hold his attention, and his last name exposed him to ridicule, so Charles Nutt found solace as a teenager in science fiction. He dropped out of high school in tenth grade to join the army. He also worked as a cartoonist, illustrator, disc jockey, usher, and dishwasher before selling his first story to Amazing Stories in 1950. During his time as an illustrator, he briefly used the pseudonyms Charles McNutt (circa 1947/48) and E.T. Beaumont (inspired by a female artist named \\"Miss Beaumont\\" with whom he had collaborated in Everett, Washington), before settling on the name Charles Beaumont. He soon adopted this name legally and used it both personally and professionally for the rest of his life. In 1954, Playboy magazine selected his story \\"Black Country\\" to be the first work of short fiction to appear in its pages. It was also at about this time that Beaumont started writing for television and film. Beaumont was energetic and spontaneous, and was known to take trips (sometimes out of the country) at a moment's notice. An avid racing fan, he often enjoyed participating in or watching area speedway races, with other authors tagging along. His cautionary fables include \\"The Beautiful People\\" (1952), about a rebellious adolescent girl in a future conformist society in which people are obligated to alter their physical appearance (adapted with friend and frequent writing partner John Tomerlin as an episode of Twilight Zone, (\\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You\\"), and \\"Free Dirt\\" (1955), about a man who gorges on his entire vegetable harvest and dies from having consumed the magical soil he used to grow it. His short story \\"The Crooked Man\\" (also published by Playboy, in 1955) presents a dystopian future wherein heterosexuality is stigmatized in the same way that homosexuality then was, with heterosexual people living furtively like pre-Stonewall gay and lesbian people. In the story, a heterosexual man meets his lover in a gay orgy bar; they try to have sex in a curtained booth (she dressed in male drag) and are caught. Beaumont wrote several scripts for The Twilight Zone, including an adaptation of his own short story, \\"The Howling Man\\", about a prisoner who might be the Devil, and the hour-long \\"Valley of the Shadow\\", about a cloistered Utopia that refuses to share its startlingly advanced technology with the outside world. Beaumont scripted the film Queen of Outer Space from an outline by Ben Hecht, deliberately writing the screenplay as a comedic parody. According to Beaumont, the directorial style is not informed by his satiric intent. He penned one episode of the Steve Canyon TV show, \\"Operation B-52\\", in which Canyon and his crew attempt to set a new speed record in a B-52 accompanied by a newsman who hates Air Force pilots. Beaumont was much admired by his colleagues (Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, Richard Matheson, Robert Bloch, Roger Corman). Many of his stories have been re-released in the posthumous volumes Best of Beaumont (Bantam, 1982) and The Howling Man (Tom Doherty, 1992), and a set of previously unpublished tales, A Touch of the Creature (Subterranean Press, 1999). In 2004, Gauntlet Press released the first of two volumes collecting Beaumont's Twilight Zone scripts. A book-length biography of Beaumont, titled Trapped in the Twilight Zone: The Life and Times of Charles Beaumont, is due to be published by Centipede Press in late 2020. Illness and death In 1963, when Beaumont was 34 and overwhelmed by numerous writing commitments, he began to suffer the effects of \\"a mysterious brain disease\\" which seemed to age him rapidly. His ability to speak, concentrate, and remember became erratic. While some people attributed all of this to Beaumont's heavy drinking, his friend and colleague John Tomerlin disagreed: \\"I was working closely with Chuck at the time, and we were good enough friends for me to know that alcohol by itself could not possibly account for the odd mental state that he was in.\\" \\"He was rarely well,\\" his friend and colleague William F. Nolan would later recall. \\"He was thin, and kept having headaches. He used Bromo-Seltzer like most people use water. He had a big Bromo bottle with him all the time\\". The disease also affected his work. \\"He could barely sell stories, much less write. He would go unshaven to meetings with producers, which would end in disaster. [A script writer has] got to be able to think on your feet, which Chuck couldn't do anymore; and so the producers would just go, 'We're sorry, Mr. Beaumont, but we don't like the script'.\\" The condition might have been related to the spinal meningitis he suffered as a child. His friend and early agent Forrest J Ackerman has asserted an alternative, that Beaumont suffered simultaneously from Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease. This claim was supported by the UCLA Medical Staff, who subjected Beaumont to a battery of tests in the mid-1960s that indicated that it might be either Alzheimer's or Pick's. Nolan recalls that the UCLA doctors sent Beaumont home with a death sentence: \\"They said, 'There's absolutely no treatment for this disease. It's permanent and it's terminal. He'll probably live from six months to three years with it. He'll decline and get to where he can't stand up. He won't feel any pain. In fact, he won't even know this is happening'.\\" In Nolan's own words: \\"Like his character 'Walter Jameson,' Chuck just dusted away\\". Several fellow writers, including Nolan and friend Jerry Sohl, began ghostwriting for Beaumont during 1963/64, so that he could meet his many writing obligations. Privately, he insisted on splitting these fees. By 1965, however, Beaumont was too ill to even create or sell story ideas. His last on-screen writing credit was for the 1965 film Mister Moses, officially a screenplay written with (but more likely written by) Monja Danischewsky. Charles Beaumont died in Woodland Hills, California at the age of 38. His son Christopher later said that \\"he looked ninety-five and was, in fact, ninety-five by every calendar except the one on your watch\\". Beaumont's last residence was in nearby Valley Village, California. He was survived by his wife Helen, two sons and two daughters. One son, Greg, worked in sound on television and was nominated for a Grammy. Greg died from colon cancer at the age of 34. The other son, Christopher, is a writer.

During this time, Nolan befriended several science-fiction and fantasy writers, including Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont and Ray Russell. Nolan became a professional author in 1956. Nolan is perhaps best known for coauthoring the novel Logan's Run, with George Clayton Johnson,David Pringle,The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction.New York: Pharos Books: St.Martins Press, 1990. (p.185-6). but has written literally hundreds of pieces, from poetry to nonfiction, to prose, for many publications, such as Sports Illustrated, Rogue, Playboy, Dark Discoveries, Nameless Digest, and others. Nolan has written several mystery novels, including the \\"Challis\\" series. He also had a long career in the movie industry, primarily working for Dan Curtis, and co-wrote the screenplay for the 1976 horror film Burnt Offerings which starred Karen Black and Bette Davis. Nolan has also been a prolific editor of collections (by others), and anthologies, most recently co- editing two anthologies with friend, filmmaker, and writer Jason V Brock: The Bleeding Edge (2009), with stories from fellow writers Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, George Clayton Johnson, John Shirley, Dan O'Bannon, and several others, and The Devil's Coattails (2012), which featured offerings from Ramsey Campbell, S. T. Joshi, Richard Selzer, Earl Hamner, Jr., and more, both from Cycatrix Press. Nolan teamed up with Bluewater Productions for a comic book series, Logan's Run: Last Day, released in 2010. In addition, he developed comics based on one other property of his for Bluewater: Tales from William F. Nolan's Dark Universe (featuring stories adapted by Nolan and Brock and published in 2013). Another comic book mini-series Sam Space (forthcoming) has been scripted and approved. Among his many accolades, Nolan has twice won the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America. He was voted a Living Legend in Dark Fantasy by the International Horror Guild in 2002, and in 2006 was bestowed the honorary title of Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Bram Stoker Award from the Horror Writers Association (HWA). In 2013 he was a recipient, along with Brian W. Aldiss, of the World Fantasy Convention Award in Brighton, England by the World Fantasy Convention. In May 2014, Nolan was presented with another Bram Stoker Award, for Superior Achievement in Nonfiction; this was for his collection about his late friend Ray Bradbury, called Nolan on Bradbury: Sixty Years of Writing about the Master of Science Fiction.\\"About William F.

Personal life Nolan was born in Kansas City, Missouri to Irish Catholic parents. He briefly attended the Kansas City Art Institute. Later, he worked for Hallmark Cards, Inc. writing verse and illustrating greeting cards before moving to California with his parents. After a few years working in offices, he met Charles Beaumont, who would remain a close friend until Beaumont's untimely death at age thirty-eight. Beaumont was instrumental in Nolan becoming an author. Nolan was also a close friend to Norman Corwin and Ray Bradbury and was a member of the influential Southern California School of Writers in the 1950s-1960s (known informally as \\"The Group\\"), many of whom wrote for Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, and other popular series of the day. Nolan is an ethical vegetarian and loves animals. He still writes new material and is active in various literary projects, conventions (he was Guest of Honor at Killer Con, and at Portland's Orycon, as well as a special guest at the World Horror Convention, World Fantasy Convention, and many others), and promotional opportunities. Though estranged for more than ten years, he has been married since 1970. He resides in Vancouver, WA.

Nolan"},{"id":"53391","text":"Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two- dimensional grid. \\"Arrow\\" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. It has been described as \\"a cross between Forth and Lemmings\\".  History  The language was originally created by Chris Pressey in 1993 for the Amiga, as an attempt to devise a language which is as hard to compile as possible. Note that the \`p\` command allows for self-modifying code. Nevertheless, a number of compilers have subsequently been written. A number of extensions to the original \\"Befunge-93\\" specification also exist, most notably Funge-98, which extends the concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions and can be multithreaded, with multiple instruction pointers operating simultaneously on the same space. Befunge-extensions and variants are called Fungeoids or just Funges. The Befunge-93 specification restricts each valid program to a grid of 80 instructions horizontally by 25 instructions vertically. Program execution which exceeds these limits \\"wraps around\\" to a corresponding point on the other side of the grid; a Befunge program is in this manner topologically equivalent to a torus. Since a Befunge-93 program can only have a single stack and its storage array is bounded, the Befunge-93 language is not Turing-complete (however, it has been shown that Befunge-93 is Turing Complete with unbounded stack word size). The later Funge-98 specification provides Turing completeness by removing the size restrictions on the program; rather than wrapping around at a fixed limit, the movement of a Funge-98 instruction pointer follows a model dubbed \\"Lahey- space\\" after its originator, Chris Lahey. In this model, the grid behaves like a torus of finite size with respect to wrapping, while still allowing itself to be extended indefinitely.  Compilation  As stated, the design goal for Befunge was to create a language which was difficult to compile. This was attempted with the implementation of self-modifying code (the 'p' instruction can write new instructions into the playfield) and a multi-dimensional playfield (the same instruction can be executed in four different directions). Nevertheless, these obstacles have been overcome, to some degree, and Befunge compilers have been written using appropriate techniques. The bef2c compiler included with the standard Befunge-93 distribution uses threaded code: each instruction is compiled to a snippet of C code, and control flows through the snippets just as it does in a Befunge interpreter (that is, conditionally on the value of some 'direction' register). This does not result in a significant advantage over a good interpreter. Note that the bef2c compiler is not correct since it does not handle either 'p' or string mode, but it would not be impossible to make it do so (although the C language might not be well-suited for this). The Betty compiler, for example, treats every possible straight line of instructions as a subprogram, and if a 'p' instruction alters that subprogram, that subprogram is recompiled. This is an interesting variation on just-in-time compilation, and it results in a much better advantage over an interpreter, since many instructions can be executed in native code without making intervening decisions on the 'direction' register.  Sample Befunge-93 code  The technique of using arrows to change control flow is demonstrated in the random number generator program below. The Befunge instruction pointer begins in the upper left corner and will travel to the right if not redirected. Following the arrows around, the \`?\` instructions send the instruction pointer in random cardinal directions until the pointer hits a digit, pushing it to the stack. Then the arrows navigate to the \`.\` to output the digit from the stack and return the pointer to the first directional randomiser. There is no \`@\` to terminate this program, so it produces an endless stream of random numbers from 1 to 9. v>>>>>v 12345 ^?^ > ? ?^ v?v 6789 >>>> v ^ .< The following code is an example of the classic \\"Hello World!\\" program. First the letters \\"olleH\\" are pushed onto the stack as ASCII numbers. These are then popped from the stack in LIFO order and output as text characters to give \\"Hello\\". A space is character number 32 in ASCII, which here is constructed by multiplying 4 and 8, before being output as text. The remaining code then outputs \\"World!\\" in a similar way, followed by ASCII character 10 (a line feed character, moving the output cursor to a new line). > v v ,,,,,\\"Hello\\"< >48*, v v,,,,,,\\"World!\\"< >25*,@ The following code is a slightly more complicated version. It adds the ASCII character 10 (a line feed character) to the stack, and then pushes \\"!dlrow ,olleH\\" to the stack. Again, LIFO ordering means that \\"H\\" is now the top of the stack and will be the first printed, \\"e\\" is second, and so on. To print the characters, the program enters a loop that first duplicates the top value on the stack (so now the stack would look like \\" !dlrow ,olleHH\\"). Then the \\"_\\" operation will pop the duplicated value, and go right if it's a zero, left otherwise. (This assumes a compliant interpreter that \\"returns\\" 0 when popping an empty stack.) When it goes left, it pops and prints the top value as an ASCII character. It then duplicates the next character and loops back to the \\"_\\" test, continuing to print the rest of the stack until it is empty and so the next value popped is 0, at which point \\"@\\" ends the program. >25*\\"!dlrow ,olleH\\":v v:,_@ > ^ Befunge-93 instruction list {- width=\\"10%\\" \`0-9\` width=\\"90%\\" Push this number on the stack - \`+\` Addition: Pop a and b, then push a+b - \`-\` Subtraction: Pop a and b, then push b-a - \`*\` Multiplication: Pop a and b, then push a*b - \`/\` Integer division: Pop a and b, then push b/a, rounded towards 0. - \`%\` Modulo: Pop a and b, then push the remainder of the integer division of b/a. - \`!\` Logical NOT: Pop a value.

Pop y and x, then push ASCII value of the character at that position in the program - \`&\` Ask user for a number and push it - \`~\` Ask user for a character and push its ASCII value - \`@\` End program - \` \`(space) No-op. Does nothing } Most one-dimensional programming languages require some syntactic distinction between comment text and source code  although that distinction may be as trivial as Brainfuck's rule that any character not in the set \`+-[]<>,.\` is a comment. Languages like Lisp and Python treat strings as comments in contexts where the values are not used. Similarly, in Befunge, there is no comment syntax: to embed documentation in the code, the programmer simply routes the control flow around the \\"comment\\" area, so that the text in that area is never executed.

The episodes are in various genres, including fantasy, science fiction, absurdism, dystopian fiction, suspense, horror, supernatural drama, black comedy, and psychological thriller, often concluding with a macabre or unexpected twist, and usually with a moral. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy tropes. The first series, shot entirely in black and white, ran on CBS for five seasons from 1959 to 1964. The Twilight Zone followed in the tradition of earlier television shows such as Tales of Tomorrow (1951‚Äì53) and Science Fiction Theatre (1955‚Äì57); radio programs such as The Weird Circle (1943‚Äì45), Dimension X (1950‚Äì51) and X Minus One (1955‚Äì58); and the radio work of one of Serling's inspirations, Norman Corwin. The success of the series led to a feature film (1983), a TV film (1994), a radio series (2002‚Äì12), various literature, theme park attractions and various other spin-offs that spanned five decades, including three revival television series. The second series (1985‚Äì89) ran on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, while the third series ran on UPN (2002‚Äì2003). In December 2017, CBS All Access officially ordered the fourth Twilight Zone series, helmed by Jordan Peele. The series premiered on April 1, 2019. TV Guide ranked the original TV series #5 in their 2013 list of the 60 greatest shows of all time and #4 in their list of the 60 greatest dramas.Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \\"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\\". TV Guide. pp. 16‚Äì17.  Television history  =Background= As a boy, Rod Serling was a fan of pulp fiction stories. As an adult, he sought topics with themes such as racism, government, war, society, and human nature in general. Serling decided to combine these two interests as a way to broach these subjects on television at a time when such issues were not commonly addressed. Throughout the 1950s, Serling established himself as one of the most popular names in television. He was as famous for writing televised drama as he was for criticizing the medium's limitations. His most vocal complaints concerned censorship, which was frequently practiced by sponsors and networks. \\"I was not permitted to have my senators discuss any current or pressing problem,\\" he said of his 1957 Studio One production \\"The Arena\\", intended to be an involving look into contemporary politics. \\"To talk of tariff was to align oneself with the Republicans; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the Democrats. To say a single thing germane to the current political scene was absolutely prohibited.\\" = \\"The Time Element\\" (1958) = CBS purchased a teleplay in 1958 that writer Rod Serling hoped to produce as the pilot of a weekly anthology series. \\"The Time Element\\" marked Serling's first entry in the field of science fiction. Plot Several years after the end of World War II, a man named Peter Jenson (William Bendix) visits a psychoanalyst, Dr. Gillespie (Martin Balsam). Jenson tells him about a recurring dream in which he tries to warn people about the \\"sneak attack\\" on Pearl Harbor before it happens, but the warnings are disregarded. Jenson believes the events of the dream are real, and each night he travels back to 1941. Dr. Gillespie insists that time travel is impossible given the nature of temporal paradoxes. While on the couch, Jenson falls asleep once again but this time dreams that the Japanese planes shoot and kill him. In Dr. Gillespie's office, the couch Jenson was lying on is now empty. Dr. Gillespie goes to a bar where he finds Jenson's picture on the wall. The bartender tells him that Jenson had tended bar there, but he was killed during the Pearl Harbor attack. William Bendix and Martin Balsam in \\"The Time Element\\" Production With the \\"Time Element\\" script, Serling drafted the fundamental elements that defined the subsequent series: a science-fiction/fantasy theme, opening and closing narration, and an ending with a twist. \\"The Time Element\\" was purchased immediately, but shelved indefinitely. This is where things stood when Bert Granet, the new producer for Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, discovered \\"The Time Element\\" in CBS' vaults while searching for an original Serling script to add prestige to his show. \\"The Time Element\\" (introduced by Desi Arnaz) debuted on November 24, 1958, to an overwhelmingly delighted audience of television viewers and critics alike. \\"The humor and sincerity of Mr. Serling's dialogue made 'The Time Element' consistently entertaining,\\" offered Jack Gould of The New York Times. Over 6,000 letters of praise flooded Granet's offices. Convinced that a series based on such stories could succeed, CBS again began talks with Serling about the possibilities of producing The Twilight Zone. \\"Where Is Everybody?\\" was accepted as the pilot episode and the project was officially announced to the public in early 1959. Other than reruns at the time \\"The Time Element\\" was not aired on television again until it was shown as part of a 1996 all-night sneak preview of the new cable channel TVLand. It is available in an Italian DVD boxed set titled Ai confini della realt√† ‚Äì I tesori perduti. The Twilight Zone Season 1 Blu-ray boxed set released on September 14, 2010, offers a remastered high-definition version of the original Desilu Playhouse production as a special feature. = First series (1959‚Äì1964) = Rod Serling working on his script with a dictating machine, 1959 The series was produced by Cayuga Productions, Inc., a production company owned and named by Serling. It reflects his background in Central New York State and is named after Cayuga Lake, on which he owned a home, and where Cornell University and Ithaca College are located. Aside from Serling, who wrote or adapted nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for The Twilight Zone included leading authors such as Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, Earl Hamner, Jr., George Clayton Johnson, Richard Matheson, Reginald Rose, and Jerry Sohl. Many episodes also featured new adaptations of classic stories by such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Jerome Bixby, Damon Knight, John Collier, and Lewis Padgett. Twilight Zone writers frequently used science fiction as a vehicle for social comment, as networks and sponsors who censored controversial material from live dramas were less concerned with seemingly innocuous fantasy and sci-fi stories. Frequent themes on The Twilight Zone included nuclear war, McCarthyism, and mass hysteria, subjects that were avoided on less serious primetime television. Episodes such as \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\" and \\"I Am the Night‚ÄîColor Me Black\\" offered specific commentary on current events and social issues. Other stories, such as \\"The Masks\\", \\"I Dream of Genie\\", or \\"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\\" were allegories, parables, or fables that reflected the moral and philosophical choices of the characters. Despite his esteem in the writing community, Serling found the series difficult to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, Mike Wallace asked a question illustrative of the times: \\"...[Y]ou're going to be, obviously, working so hard on The Twilight Zone that, in essence, for the time being and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?\\" While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps into the middle of the action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, they are aware of his presence: In the episode \\"A World of His Own\\", a writer (Keenan Wynn) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration and promptly erases Serling from the show. In season two, due to budgetary constraints, the network decided ‚Äì against Serling's wishes ‚Äì to cut costs by shooting some episodes on videotape rather than film. The requisite multicamera setup of the videotape format precluded location shooting, severely limiting the potential scope of the storylines, and the experiment was abandoned after just six episodes (\\"Twenty Two\\", \\"Static\\", \\"The Whole Truth\\", \\"The Lateness of the Hour\\", \\"The Night of the Meek\\", and \\"Long Distance Call\\"). The first series contains 156 episodes. The episodes in seasons one through three are 30 minutes long with commercials (24 or 25 minutes without commercials). Season four (1962‚Äì63) consists of one-hour episodes with commercials (51 minutes without commercials). Season five returned to the half-hour format. =Second series (1985‚Äì1989)= It was Serling's decision to sell his share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a Twilight Zone revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing The Twilight Zone than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, turning down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and Buck Houghton and later from American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. CBS gave the new Twilight Zone a greenlight in 1984 under the supervision of Carla Singer, then Vice President of Drama Development. While the show did not come close to matching the enduring popularity of the original, some episodes ‚Äì particularly Alan Brennert's love story \\"Her Pilgrim Soul\\" and J. Neil Schulman's \\"Profile in Silver\\" ‚Äì were critically acclaimed. In a tribute to the first series, the opening credits include a brief image of Rod Serling. Four episodes are remakes of those from the first series: \\"Night of the Meek\\", \\"Shadow Play\\", \\"The After Hours\\" and \\"A Game of Pool\\", while \\"Dead Woman's Shoes\\" is an adaptation of \\"Dead Man's Shoes\\". Unlike the first series and the third series, this series does not include the opening monologue during the title sequence. As well, the narration is all strictly voice-over and the narrator never appears on-screen. =Rod Serling's Lost Classics (1994)= In the early 1990s, Richard Matheson and Carol Serling produced an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet- unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines for such a production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script (\\"Where the Dead Are\\") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. She showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. \\"I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called my partner and said, \\"I love it,\\" recalled O'Hara. \\"This is pure imagination, a period piece, literate ‚Äì some might say wordy. If Rod Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't have a chance at getting made.\\" Eager to capitalize on Serling's celebrity status as a writer, CBS packaged \\"Where the Dead Are\\" with Matheson's adaptation of \\"The Theatre\\", debuting as a two-hour feature on the night of May 19, 1994, under the name Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics. The title represents a misnomer, as both stories were conceived long after Twilight Zone's cancellation. Written just months before Serling's death, \\"Where the Dead Are\\" starred Patrick Bergin as a 19th-century doctor who stumbles upon a mad scientist's medical experiments with immortality. \\"The Theatre\\" starred Amy Irving and Gary Cole as a couple who visits a cineplex where they discover the feature presentation depicts their own lives. James Earl Jones provided opening and closing narrations. Critical response was mixed. Gannett News Service described it as \\"taut and stylish, a reminder of what can happen when fine actors are given great words.\\" USA Today was less impressed, even suggesting that Carol Serling \\"should have left these two unproduced mediocrities in the garage where she found them.\\" Ultimately, ratings proved insufficient to justify a proposed sequel featuring three scripts adapted by Matheson. =Third series (2002‚Äì2003)= A third series was developed by UPN in 2002, it was hosted by Forest Whitaker. It was broadcast in a one-hour format composed of two half-hour stories, it was canceled after one season. \\"It's Still a Good Life\\" is a sequel to \\"It's a Good Life\\", \\"The Monsters Are on Maple Street\\" is an adaptation of \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" is a remake of an episode from the first series, with Serling still credited as writer. =Fourth series (2019‚Äìpresent)= In December 2012, it was reported that Bryan Singer was developing and executive producing a fourth series television series for CBS Television Studios. A writer for the series was not chosen and the program was not pitched to any networks. CBS, which broadcast the first series and second series, was reportedly interested. In February 2013, Singer told TG Daily that the project was still in development and that he hoped to direct the pilot and have A-list actors appear on the revival. The following month, he told IGN that a writer with whom he had previously worked was in negotiations to join the revival and that he felt \\"passionate\\" towards the first series and the planned revival. In February 2016, it was reported that Ken Levine would write and direct the pilot episode of the revival series. It was also reported that the series would be interactive. In November 2017, it was reported that Jordan Peele was developing a reboot of the series for streaming service CBS All Access with Marco Ramirez serving as potential showrunner. In December 2017, CBS All Access ordered the fourth The Twilight Zone series to series. It was announced that the series would be produced by CBS Television Studios in association with Monkeypaw Productions and Genre Films. Jordan Peele, Marco Ramirez, and Simon Kinberg will serve as executive producers for the series and collaborate on the premiere episode. Win Rosenfeld and Audrey Chon will also serve as executive producers. Peele was revealed to be the new host and narrator in September 2018, and the new opening sequence was released. The series premiered on April 1, 2019. The season 1 episode \\"Nightmare at 30,000 Feet\\" is based on the first series' season 5 episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\". The season 2 episode \\"You May Also Like\\" features the Kanamits, who first appeared in the first series' season 3 episode \\"To Serve Man\\". Other media =Film= Twilight Zone: The Movie is a 1983 feature film produced by Steven Spielberg. It starred Dan Aykroyd, Albert Brooks, John Lithgow, and the late Vic Morrow and Scatman Crothers. The film remade three classic episodes of the first series and included one original story. John Landis directed the prologue and the first segment, Steven Spielberg directed the second, Joe Dante the third, and George Miller directed the final segment. Landis's episode became notorious for a helicopter accident during filming that caused the deaths of Morrow and two child actors. Potential film Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is planning to make a new film with Warner Bros., citing The Twilight Zone as his favorite TV series. Unlike the first film, which was an anthology feature, it will be a big-budget, SFX-laden continuous story possibly based on classic episodes of the series such as \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"To Serve Man\\", or any of the 92 scripts written by Rod Serling, to which Warner Bros. owns the rights. One plot leaked from the script tells about a pilot who time-travels 96 years into the future. Cloverfield director Matt Reeves was signed in 2011 to direct the movie, but left in 2012 to direct Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. On August 16, 2013, Joseph Kosinski was announced to direct. The studio hired Aron Eli Coleite to pen the screenplay for the film and will not be an anthology but use various elements from the Twilight Zone universe. In June 2017, Christine Lavaf was hired to pen the script. =Games= In 1964, Ideal released a board game, The Twilight Zone Game, at the height of the show's popularity. The game consisted of a cardboard playing surface, four colored playing pieces, a colored spinning wheel, and 12 \\"door\\" playing cards. In 1988, Gigabit Systems, Inc. published a text adventure video game for Amiga and the PC. In March 1992, Midway Games released a wide-body pinball game, Twilight Zone, based on the original TV series, as a Bally title. Conceived by Pat Lawlor, it uses Golden Earring's hit song \\"Twilight Zone\\" (1982) as its theme song. The game sold 15,235 units. On September 17, 2014, Legacy Interactive and Spark Plug Games released a casual adventure game based on The Twilight Zone. =Literature= Serling novelized several of his original scripts, which were published in the anthologies Stories from the Twilight Zone (1960), More Stories from the Twilight Zone (1961) and New Stories from the Twilight Zone (1962); these have all been reprinted several times, including in an omnibus, The Twilight Zone: Complete Stories (1980). In 1995, DAW Books published the anthology books Journeys to the Twilight Zone (16 stories edited by Carol Serling including Rod Serling's \\"Suggestion\\"), Return to the Twilight Zone (18 stories edited by Carol Serling including Rod Serling's \\"The Sole Survivor\\"), and Adventures in the Twilight Zone (24 stories edited by Carol Serling including Rod Serling's \\"Lindemann's Catch\\"). In September 2009, Tor Books published Twilight Zone: 19 Original Stories on the 50th Anniversary, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series. It contains stories by 20 authors such as R. L. Stine and Timothy Zahn, and an introduction by Carol Serling. Comic books Western Publishing published a Twilight Zone comic book, first providing content under contract to publisher Dell Comics for four issues, one in 1961 and three further issues in 1962, with the first two published as part of their long- running Four Color anthology series as issue numbers 1173 and 1288, and then two further one-shots numbered separately in Dell's unique fashion as 01-860-207 and 12-860-210 (numbered as 01-860-210 on the inside) respectively. Western then restarted the series under its own Gold Key imprint with a formal issue No. 1, which ran 92 issues from 1962 to 1979, with the final issue being published in 1982. Several of the stories were reprinted in their Mystery Comics Digest, which mentioned the title on the covers. A wide range of artists worked on the title, including Jack Sparling, Reed Crandall, Lee Elias, George Evans, Russ Jones, Joe Orlando, Jerry Robinson, Mike Sekowsky, Dan Spiegle, Frank Thorne, and Alex Toth. The first published comic book work of artist Frank Miller appeared in issue 84 (June 1978). In 1990, NOW Comics published a single issue of a new series using the title logo from the 1985 revival, featuring an adaptation of Harlan Ellison's story \\"Crazy as a Soup Sandwich\\". The issue was reprinted as Twilight Zones Premiere in 1991, followed by an eleven issue second volume (1991‚Äì1992) and a four issue third volume (1993), as well as an annual and a 3-D special in 1993. In 2008, students at the Savannah College of Art and Design partnered with Walker & Co. to create graphic novels based on eight episodes of the series through 2009. The first four, \\"Walking Distance\\", \\"The After Hours\\", \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\", and \\"The Odyssey of Flight 33\\", were released in December 2011. The other four were \\"The Midnight Sun\\", \\"Deaths-Head Revisited\\", \\"The Big Tall Wish\\" and \\"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?\\" Comics publisher Dynamite Entertainment ran a multiple-issue series, written by J. Michael Straczynski and with art by Guiu Vilanova, beginning in December 2013. =Music= Television series * Marius Constant composed the theme used for the series from the second season onward. This replaced Bernard Herrmann's theme for the first season, though Constant's theme is more associated with the recognizable sound of The Twilight Zone and most of its incarnations. The guitar part was performed by jazz guitarist and session musician Howard Roberts on a 1952 Fender Telecaster. Other music contributors for the original television show are Jerry Goldsmith, Leonard Rosenman, Nathan Scott, Fred Steiner, Nathan Van Cleave, Ren√© Garriguenc and Franz Waxman. * The Grateful Dead performed the theme for the 1985 revival series. * Jonathan Davis of Korn composed the theme music for the 2002 revival series. * Marco Beltrami and Brandon Roberts composed the music for the 2019 revival. Film * Jerry Goldsmith composed the music for Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983). Influence in popular music The Marketts' biggest hit, \\"Out of Limits\\",, originally entitled \\"Outer Limits\\", was named after the 1963 TV series The Outer Limits. Rod Serling sued the Marketts for quoting the four- note motif from The Twilight Zone, without his approval, which resulted in the change of the title to \\"Out of Limits\\". It reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1964. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Many other musicians have written and performed music based on The Twilight Zone, including: 2 Unlimited (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Anthrax (\\"Intro to Reality\\"), Average White Band, John Cale, Dr. John, David Dubowski (\\"To Serve Man\\"), Golden Earring (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Michael Hurley, Tech N9ne, Iron Maiden (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Mekong Delta (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Van Morrison (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Rush (\\"The Twilight Zone\\"), Raymond Scott, Sly & Robbie, Magneto Dayo, The Manhattan Transfer (\\"Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone\\"), The Residents, The Ventures (\\"Twilight Zone\\"), Panic! at the Disco and John Williams. =Radio= Beginning in 2002, episodes of the original The Twilight Zone were adapted for radio, with Stacy Keach taking Serling's role as narrator and produced by Carl Amari of Falcon Picture Group. Each episode features a current Hollywood celebrity, including Jason Alexander, Blair Underwood, Lou Gossett, Jr., Michael York, Jim Caviezel, Jane Seymour, Don Johnson, Sean Astin, Luke Perry and others in the title roles. The series is broadcast on hundreds of radio stations from coast-to-coast and over Sirius/XM. The station list and episodes for download, including 3 Free episodes are available at the official website at www.twilightzoneradio.com =Scripts= Beginning in 2001, Gauntlet Press began publishing collections of original scripts from The Twilight Zone by Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, and Rod Serling. A ten-volume signed, limited edition series of all 92 of Rod Serling's scripts, authorized by his wife, Carol Serling, began yearly publication in 2004. Many of the scripts contain handwritten edits by Serling himself and differ in significant ways from the aired versions; most volumes contain an alternate version of a selected script. The script for \\"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\\" has been published into 7th grade reading books in the form of a play. =Stage productions= Live theatre productions of the original episodes can be seen in Los Angeles and Seattle, where Theater Schmeater has continuously produced a late night series, \\"The Twilight Zone ‚Äì Live\\" with permission of the Serling estate, since 1996. In 2009, Masquerade, A Chennai based theater group produced 'Dystopia', loosely based on the episodes \\"The Obsolete Man\\" and \\"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\\". In 2011, the Penn State University theatre group, No Refund Theatre, produced a stage adaptation of The Twilight Zone. It included the episodes \\"The Eye of the Beholder\\", \\"The Midnight Sun\\", and \\"Nothing in the Dark\\". It was directed by Anthony Arbaiza. In 2017, Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School produced a live adaptation directed by Adam Graham with permission from CBS, with two shows containing four episodes each. These episodes included \\"Will The Real Martian Please Stand Up?\\" and \\"The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street.\\" as well as more technically challenging episodes such as \\"Penny For Your Thoughts\\" and \\"The Eye of the Beholder.\\" In December 2017 the Almeida Theatre in London are staging the World Premiere production of 'The Twilight Zone'. Adapted by Anne Washburn and directed by Laurence Olivier Award winner Richard Jones, and will be based on stories from the first series by Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson. =Theme park attraction= The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is a theme park attraction based on the original Twilight Zone series. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the attraction is present at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris and Tokyo DisneySea in Japan. A fourth attraction at Disney California Adventure operated from 2004 to 2017 before being re-themed to Guardians of the Galaxy ‚Äì Mission: Breakout!. The attraction in Japan is the only one not themed to The Twilight Zone, due to cultural differences and constraints in licensing for the Oriental Land Company, owner and operator of the Tokyo parks. The ride also served as the inspiration for the 1997 TV film Tower of Terror, which bears no connection to the attraction or The Twilight Zone. =Syndication= The Twilight Zone first series is currently in syndication on MeTV NetworkMeTV Network Schedule http://metv.com/shows/ and Syfy, and the 2002 revival is syndicated on the El Rey Network. In popular culture In Matt Groening's Futurama, there is a dystopian TV show called The Scary Door, the title sequence, dystopian themes and comedic premise of which are heavily influenced by The Twilight Zone. One episode of The Scary Door, \\"The Last Man On Earth\\", parodies The Twilight Zone's original season 1 episode Time Enough At Last.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4vctmsx3xwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5oGJTUpbpA Many Treehouse Of Horror episodes of The Simpsons also reference the show. These include Treehouse of Horror IV (where Bart sees a gremlin on the side of the school bus [\\"Terror at 5 1/2 Feet\\"]), Treehouse of Horror III (which features an evil Krusty The Clown doll [\\"Clown Without Pity\\"]) and Treehouse of Horror (where the family are abducted by aliens [\\"Hungry Are The Damned\\"]). Homer also references the show in the Homer3 (Homer Cubed) segment of Treehouse of Horror VI, when, upon entering the 3rd dimension, he says \\"It's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone\\". https://www.westword.com/arts/top-ten-twilight-zone-references-in-pop- culture-5814980https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmLKT3Azbt8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfAvmDYMjJQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugZOvUjt2Nkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dvavcX9I8g The X-Files character Robert Matheson is named after one of the original series' writers. https://www.westword.com/arts/top-ten-twilight-zone- references-in-pop-culture-5814980 In Mad Men, Paul Kinsey quotes Rod Serling's \\"submitted for your approval\\" opening, and foreshadows the original show's cancellation (Season 1, Episode 2), saying \\"Mitch in Media says CBS might pull the plug  I'll kill myself.\\"https://www.westword.com/arts/top-ten-twilight- zone-references-in-pop-culture-5814980 Many bands and artists have released songs dedicated to the show, with some titled \\"The Twilight Zone\\"/\\"Twilight Zone\\", as listed above.

The sudden appearance of a culture based on agriculture around 3000 BC is believed to reflect the arrival of the ancestors of today's Taiwanese indigenous peoples. The island was colonized by the Dutch in the 17th century, followed by an influx of Hoklo people including Hakka immigrants from the Fujian and Guangdong areas of mainland China, across the Taiwan Strait. The Spanish built a settlement in the north for a brief period but were driven out by the Dutch in 1642. In 1662, Koxinga, a loyalist of the Ming dynasty who had lost control of mainland China in 1644, defeated the Dutch and established a base of operations on the island. His forces were defeated by the Qing dynasty in 1683, and parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing empire. Following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, the Qing ceded the island, along with Penghu, to the Empire of Japan. Taiwan produced rice and sugar to be exported to the Empire of Japan, and also served as a base for the Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia and the Pacific during World War II. Japanese imperial education was implemented in Taiwan and many Taiwanese also fought for Japan during the war. In 1945, following the end of World War II, the nationalist government of the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang (KMT), took control of Taiwan. In 1949, after losing control of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, the ROC government under the KMT withdrew to Taiwan and Chiang Kai-shek declared martial law. The KMT ruled Taiwan (along with the Islands of Kinmen, Wuqiu and the Matsu on the opposite side of the Taiwan Strait) as a single-party state for forty years, until democratic reforms in the 1980s, which led to the first-ever direct presidential election in 1996. During the post-war period, Taiwan experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth known as the \\"Taiwan Miracle\\", and was known as one of the \\"Four Asian Tigers\\". Early settlement In the Late Pleistocene, sea levels were about 140 m lower than in the present day, exposing the floor of the shallow Taiwan Strait as a land bridge that was crossed by mainland fauna. The oldest evidence of human presence on Taiwan consists of three cranial fragments and a molar tooth found at Chouqu and Gangzilin, in Zuojhen District, Tainan. These are estimated to be between 20,000 and 30,000 years old.Zuozhen Man , Encyclopedia of Taiwan. The oldest artefacts are chipped- pebble tools of a Paleolithic culture found in four caves in Changbin, Taitung, dated 15,000 to 5,000 years ago, and similar to contemporary sites in Fujian. The same culture is found at sites at Eluanbi on the southern tip of Taiwan, persisting until 5,000 years ago.Changbin Culture , Encyclopedia of Taiwan. At the beginning of the Holocene 10,000 years ago, sea levels rose, forming the Taiwan Strait and cutting off the island from the Asian mainland. In December 2011, the ~8,000 year old Liangdao Man skeleton was found on Liang Island. In 2014, the mitochondrial DNA of the skeleton was found to belong to Haplogroup E, with two of the four mutations characteristic of the E1 subgroup. The only Paleolithic burial that has been found on Taiwan was in Xiaoma cave in the southeast of the island, dating from about 4000 BC, of a male similar in type to Negritos found in the Philippines. There are also references in Chinese texts and Taiwanese aboriginal oral traditions to pygmies on the island at some time in the past. Around 3,000 BC, the Neolithic Dapenkeng culture abruptly appeared and quickly spread around the coast of the island. Their sites are characterised by corded-ware pottery, polished stone adzes and slate points. The inhabitants cultivated rice and millet, but were also heavily reliant on marine shells and fish. Most scholars believe this culture is not derived from the Changbin culture, but was brought across the Strait by the ancestors of today's Taiwanese aborigines, speaking early Austronesian languages.Tapenkeng Site, Encyclopedia of Taiwan. Some of these people later migrated from Taiwan to the islands of Southeast Asia and thence throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Malayo-Polynesian languages are now spoken across a huge area from Madagascar to Hawaii, Easter Island and New Zealand, but form only one branch of the Austronesian family, the rest of whose branches are found only on Taiwan. The Dapenkeng culture was succeeded by a variety of cultures throughout the island, including the Tahu and Yingpu cultures. Iron appeared at the beginning of the current era in such cultures as the Niaosung Culture. The earliest metal artifacts were trade goods, but by around 400 AD wrought iron was being produced locally using bloomeries, a technology possibly introduced from the Philippines. Early Chinese histories refer to visits to eastern islands that some historians identify with Taiwan. Troops of the Three Kingdoms state of Wu are recorded as visiting an island known as Yizhou () in the 3rd century. The Book of Sui relates that Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty sent three expeditions to a place called \\"Liuqiu\\" early in the 7th century. Later the name Liuqiu (whose characters are read in Japanese as \\"Ryukyu\\") referred to the island chain to the northeast of Taiwan, but some scholars believe it may have referred to Taiwan in the Sui period. Okinawa Island was referred to by the Chinese as \\"Great Liuqiu\\" and Taiwan as \\"Lesser Liuqiu\\". Portuguese sailors, passing Taiwan in 1544, first jotted in a ship's log the name of the island Ilha Formosa, meaning \\"Beautiful Island\\". In 1582, the survivors of a Portuguese shipwreck spent ten weeks battling malaria and aborigines before returning to Macau on a raft. By the 16th century, increasing numbers of Chinese fishermen, traders and pirates were visiting the southwestern part of the island. When the Dutch arrived in 1623, they found about 1,500 Chinese visitors and residents.  Dutch and Spanish rule  Taiwan in the 17th century, showing Dutch (magenta) and Spanish (green) possessions, and the Kingdom of Middag (orange) Replica of an East Indiaman of the Dutch East India Company/United East India Company (VOC). The Dutch East India Company (VOC) came to the area in search of an Asian trade and military base. Defeated by the Portuguese at the Battle of Macau in 1622, they attempted to occupy Penghu, but were driven off by the Ming authorities. They then built Fort Zeelandia on the islet of Tayowan off the southwest coast of Taiwan. (The site is now part of the main island, in modern Anping, Tainan.) On the adjacent mainland, they built a smaller brick fort, Fort Provintia. Local aboriginals called the area Pakan and on some old maps the island of Taiwan is named Pakan.1662 Map of Formosa In 1626, the Spanish Empire, viewing the Dutch presence on Taiwan as a threat to their colony in the Philippines, established a settlement at Sant√≠sima Trinidad on the northeast coast of Taiwan (modern Keelung), building Fort San Salvador. They also built Fort Santo Domingo in the northwest (modern Tamsui) in 1629, but had abandoned it by 1638. The small colony was plagued by disease and a hostile local population, and received little support from Manila. The Dutch Governor Pieter Nuyts got entangled in a dispute with the Japanese Hamada Yahei. The Dutch were defeated at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay by the Chinese Zheng Zhilong in 1633. The Dutch set out to turn Taiwan into a Dutch colony. The first order of business was to punish villages that had violently opposed the Dutch and unite the aborigines in allegiance with the VOC. The first punitive expedition was against the villages of Baccloan and Mattauw, north of Saccam near Tayowan. The Mattauw campaign had been easier than expected and the tribe submitted after having their village razed by fire. The campaign also served as a threat to other villages from Tirossen (modern Chiayi) to Lonkjiaow (Hengchun). The 1636 punitive attack on Lamay Island in response to the killing of the shipwrecked crews of the Beverwijck and the Golden Lion ended ten years later with the entire aboriginal population of 1100 removed from the island including 327 Lamayans killed in a cave, having been trapped there by the Dutch and suffocated in the fumes and smoke pumped into the cave by the Dutch and their allied aborigines from Saccam, Soulang and Pangsoya. The men were forced into slavery in Batavia (Java) and the women and children became servants and wives for the Dutch officers. The events on Lamay changed the course of Dutch rule to work closer with allied aborigines, though there remained plans to depopulate the outlying islands. In 1642, the Dutch ejected the Spanish from the north of the island. They then sought to establish control of the western plains between the new possessions and their base at Tayouan. After a brief but destructive campaign in 1645, Pieter Boon was able to subdue the tribes in this area, including the Kingdom of Middag. Bird's eye view of Fort Zeelandia in Dutch Formosa in the 17th-century The VOC administered the island and its predominantly aboriginal population until 1662, setting up a tax system, schools to teach romanized script of aboriginal languages and evangelizing Christianity. Although its control was mainly limited to the western plain of the island, the Dutch systems were adopted by succeeding occupiers. The first influx of migrants were the Hakkas and Hokkiens who came during the Dutch period, in which merchants and traders from the mainland Chinese coast sought to purchase hunting licenses from the Dutch or hide out in aboriginal villages to escape the Qing authorities. Most of the immigrants were young single males who were discouraged from staying on the island often referred to by Han as \\"The Gate of Hell\\" for its reputation in taking the lives of sailors and explorers. The Dutch originally sought to use their castle Zeelandia at Tayowan as a trading base between Japan and China, but soon realized the potential of the huge deer populations that roamed in herds of thousands along the alluvial plains of Taiwan's western regions. Deer were in high demand by the Japanese, who were willing to pay exorbitant prices for use of the hides in samurai armor. Other parts of the deer were sold to Han traders for meat and medical use. The Dutch paid aborigines for the deer brought to them and tried to manage the deer stocks to keep up with demand. The Dutch also employed Han to farm sugarcane and rice for export. Some of these rice and sugarcane products reached as far as the markets of Persia. Unfortunately, the deer the aborigines had relied on for their livelihoods began to disappear, forcing the aborigines to adopt new means of survival.  Kingdom of Tungning  Taiwan Confucian Temple built during the reign of Zheng Jing On the mainland, Manchu forces broke through Shanhai Pass in 1644 and rapidly overwhelmed the Ming dynasty. In 1661, a naval fleet led by the Ming loyalist Koxinga arrived in Taiwan to oust the Dutch from Zeelandia and establish a pro-Ming base in Taiwan. Koxinga was born to Zheng Zhilong, a Chinese merchant and pirate, and Tagawa Matsu, a Japanese woman, in 1624 in Hirado, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. He was raised there until seven and moved to Quanzhou, in the Fujian province of China. In a family made wealthy from shipping and piracy, Koxinga inherited his father's trade networks, which stretched from Nagasaki to Macao. Following the Manchu advance on Fujian, Koxinga retreated from his stronghold in Amoy (Xiamen city) and besieged Taiwan in the hope of establishing a strategic base to marshal his troops to retake his base at Amoy. In 1662, following a nine-month siege, Koxinga captured the Dutch fortress Zeelandia and Taiwan became his base (see Kingdom of Tungning). The Taiwanese Aboriginal tribes who were previously allied with the Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty. The Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded to work for the Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions. The frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian school textbooks. Koxinga died four months after the siege was over, there were speculations that he died in a sudden fit of madness when his officers refused to carry out his orders to execute his son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing had an affair with his wet nurse and conceived a child with her. Other accounts are more straightforward, attributing Koxinga's death to a case of malaria. Following the death of Koxinga, his son Zheng Jing took over the Zheng regime, leading the remaining 7,000 Ming loyalist troops to Taiwan. In response to raids by Zheng Jing and in an effort to starve out the forces in Taiwan, the Qing decreed to relocate all of the southern coastal towns and ports that had been the targets of raids by the Zheng fleet and thus provided supplies for the resistance. This measure largely backfired, and between 1662 and 1664, six major waves of immigration occurred from these coastal towns to Taiwan, spurred by the severe hardships incurred from the Qing relocation policy. In a move to take advantage of this Qing misstep, Zheng Jing promoted immigration to Taiwan by promising free eastern land cultivation and ownership for peasants in exchange for compulsory military service by all males in case the island was in danger of a Qing invasion.  Qing rule  Main gate of Lukang Longshan Temple, built in 1786 =Initial immigration restriction= In 1683, following a naval engagement with Admiral Shi Lang, one of Koxinga's father's trusted friends, Koxinga's grandson Zheng Keshuang, surrendered to the Qing dynasty. There has been much confusion about Taiwan's association with the rumored \\"Island of Dogs,\\" \\"Island of Women,\\" etc., which were thought, by Han literati, to lie beyond the seas. Taiwan was officially regarded by the Kangxi Emperor as \\"a ball of mud beyond the pale of civilization\\" and did not appear on any map of the imperial domain until 1683. The act of presenting a map to the emperor was equal to presenting the lands of the empire. It took several more years before the Qing court would recognize Taiwan as part of the Qing realm. Prior to the Qing dynasty, China was conceived as a land bound by mountains, rivers and seas. The idea of an island as a part of China was unfathomable to the Han prior to the Qing frontier expansion effort of the 17th century. Despite the expense of the military and diplomatic campaign that brought Taiwan into the imperial realm, the general sentiment in Beijing was ambivalent. The point of the campaign had been to destroy the Zheng-family regime, not to conquer the island. The Kangxi Emperor expressed the sentiment that Taiwan was \\"the size of a pellet; taking it is no gain; not taking it is no loss\\" (ÂΩà‰∏∏‰πãÂú∞„ÄÇÂæó‰πãÁÑ°ÊâÄÂä†Ôºå‰∏çÂæóÁÑ°ÊâÄÊêç). His ministers counseled that the island was \\"a ball of mud beyond the sea, adding nothing to the breadth of China\\" (Êµ∑Â§ñÊ≥•‰∏∏Ôºå‰∏çË∂≥ÁÇ∫‰∏≠ÂúãÂä†Âª£), and advocated removing all the Chinese to mainland China and abandoning the island. It was only the campaigning of admiral Shi Lang and other supporters that convinced the emperor not to abandon Taiwan. Koxinga's followers were forced to depart from Taiwan to the more unpleasant parts of Qing controlled land. By 1682 there were only 7000 Chinese left on Taiwan as they had intermarried with aboriginal women and had property in Taiwan. The Koxinga reign had continued the tax systems of the Dutch, established schools and religious temples. From 1683, the Qing dynasty ruled the island as Taiwan Prefecture and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures, north and south. In 1887, the island was declared as a separate Fokien-Taiwan Province. The Qing authorities tried to limit immigration to Taiwan and barred families from traveling to Taiwan to ensure the immigrants would return to their families and ancestral graves. Illegal immigration continued, but many of the men had few prospects in war-weary Fujian and thus married locally, resulting in the idiom \\"has Tangshan father, no Tangshan mother\\" (). The Qing tried to protect aboriginal land claims, but also sought to turn them into tax paying subjects. Chinese and tax paying aborigines were barred from entering the wilderness which covered most of the island for the fear of raising the ire of the non taxpaying, highland aborigines and inciting rebellion. A border was constructed along the western plain, built using pits and mounds of earth, called \\"earth cows\\", to discourage squatting. =Early Han settlers= From 1683 to around 1760, the Qing government limited immigration to Taiwan. Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s and by 1811 there were more than two million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan. In 1875 Taipeh Prefecture was established, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province. Also, there had been various conflicts between Chinese immigrants. Most conflicts were between Han from Fujian and Han from Guangdong, between people from different areas of Fujian, between Han and Hakka settlers, or simply between people of different surnames engaged in clan feuds. Because of the strong provincial loyalties held by these immigrants, the Qing government felt Taiwan was somewhat difficult to govern. Taiwan was also plagued by foreign invasions. Given the strategic and commercial value of Taiwan, there were British suggestions in 1840 and 1841 to seize the island. In September 1841, during the First Opium War, the British transport ship Nerbudda became shipwrecked near Keelung Harbour due to a typhoon. The brig Ann also became shipwrecked in March 1842. Most of the crew were Indian lascars. Survivors from both ships were transferred by authorities to the capital Tainan. The Taiwan Qing commanders, Ta-hung-ah and Yao Ying, filed a disingenuous report to the emperor, claiming to have defended against an attack from the Keelung fort. In October 1841, HMS Nimrod sailed to Keelung to search for the Nerbudda survivors, but after Captain Joseph Pearse found out that they were sent south for imprisonment, he ordered the bombardment of the harbour and destroyed 27 sets of cannon before returning to Hong Kong. Most of the survivors‚Äîover 130 from the Nerbudda and 54 from the Ann‚Äîwere executed in Tainan in August 1842. The Aboriginals often slaughtered the shipwrecked crews of Western ships. In 1867 the entire American crew of the Rover were massacred by aboriginals in the Rover incident. When the Americans launched the punitive Formosa Expedition in retaliation, the aboriginals defeated the Americans and forced them to retreat, killing an American marine while suffering no casualties themselves. During the Sino-French War, the French attempted an invasion of Taiwan during the Keelung Campaign in 1884. Liu Mingchuan, who was leading the defense of Taiwan, recruited Aboriginals to serve alongside the Chinese soldiers in fighting against the French. The French were defeated at the Battle of Tamsui and the Qing forces pinned the French down at Keelung in an eight-month-long campaign before the French withdrew. Because of these incursions, the Qing government began constructing a series of coastal defenses and in 1885, work commenced to make Taiwan a province, with Liu Mingchuan serving as the first governor. He divided Taiwan into eleven counties and tried to improve relations with the aborigines. He also developed a railway from Taipei to Hsinchu, established a mine in Keelung, and built an arsenal to improve Taiwan's defensive capability against foreigners. Following a shipwreck of a Ryukyuan vessel on the southeastern tip of Taiwan in winter of 1871, in which the heads of 54 crew members were taken by the aboriginal Taiwanese Paiwan people in the Mudan incident, the Japanese sought to use this incident as a pretext to have the Qing formally acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands as Japanese territory and to test reactions to potential expansion into Taiwan. According to records from Japanese documents, and , the Qing ministers at Zongli Yamen who handled the complaints from Japanese envoy , replied first that they had heard only of a massacre of Ryukyuans, not of Japanese, and quickly noted that Ryukyu was under Chinese suzerainty, and therefore this issue was not Japan's business. In addition, the governor-general of the Qing province Fujian had rescued the survivors of the massacre and returned them safely to Ryukyu. The Qing authorities explained that there were two kinds of aborigines on Taiwan: those governed by the Qing, and those unnaturalized \\"raw barbarians ... beyond the reach of Qing government and customs.\\" They indirectly hinted that foreigners traveling in those areas settled by indigenous people must exercise caution. After the Yanagihara-Yamen interview, the Japanese took their explanation to mean that the Qing government had not opposed Japan's claims to sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands, disclaimed any jurisdiction over Aboriginal Taiwanese, and had indeed consented to Japan's expedition to Taiwan. The Qing dynasty made it clear to the Japanese that Taiwan was definitely within Qing jurisdiction, even though part of that island's aboriginal population was not yet under the influence of Chinese culture. The Qing also pointed to similar cases all over the world where an aboriginal population within a national boundary was not completely subjugated by the dominant culture of that country. The Japanese nevertheless launched an expedition to Mutan village with a force of 3600 soldiers in 1874. The number of killed Paiwan was about thirty, and that for the Japanese was six. Eventually, the Japanese withdrew after being paid a massive indemnity by the Qing. This incident caused the Qing to re-think the importance of Taiwan in their maritime defense strategy and greater importance was placed on gaining control over the wilderness regions. On the eve of the First Sino-Japanese War, about 45 percent of the island was administered under direct Qing administration while the remaining was lightly populated by Aborigines. In a population of around 2.5 million, about 2.3 million were Han Chinese and the remaining two hundred thousand were classified as members of various indigenous tribes. =End of Qing Rule= William Campbell As part of the settlement for losing the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing empire ceded the islands of Taiwan and Penghu to Japan on April 17, 1895, according to the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The loss of Taiwan would become a rallying point for the Chinese nationalist movement in the years that followed.  Japanese rule  A 1912 map of Japan with Taiwan, which was ruled by the Empire of Japan from 1895 to 1945. Japan had sought to claim sovereignty over Taiwan (known to them as ) since 1592, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi undertook a policy of overseas expansion and extending Japanese influence southward and westward. To the west, Japan invaded Korea in that time period, with the eventual conquest of China contemplated. To the south an initial attempt to invade Taiwan and subsequent sporadic invasion attempts spanning three centuries were unsuccessful due mainly to disease and attacks by aborigines on the island. In 1609, the Tokugawa shogunate sent Harunobu Arima on an exploratory mission of the island. An attempted invasion in 1616, led by Murayama T≈çan, failed when the fleet was dispersed by a typhoon and the only ship to reach the island was repelled. In the Mudan Incident of 1871, an Okinawan ship was wrecked on the southern tip of Taiwan and 54 crewmen were beheaded by Paiwan aborigines. After the Qing government refused to make compensation, stating that the aboriginals were not under its control, Japan launched a punitive expedition to the area in 1874, withdrawing after the Qing promised to pay an indemnity. Smits, Gregory (1999). \\"Visions of Ry≈´ky≈´: Identity and Ideology in Early-Modern Thought and Politics.\\" Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press. =Occupation= It was not until the defeat of the Chinese navy during the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894‚Äì95 that Japan was finally able to gain possession of Taiwan, and with it saw the shifting of Asian dominance from China to Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on April 17, 1895, ceding Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan, which would rule the island for 50 years until its defeat in World War II. Soldiers of the 1874 expedition in Taiwan After receiving sovereignty of Taiwan, the Japanese feared military resistance from Taiwanese who followed the establishment by the local elite of the short-lived Republic of Formosa. Taiwan's elite hoped that by declaring themselves a republic the world would not stand by and allow a sovereign state to be invaded by the Japanese, and therefore allied with the Qing. The plan quickly turned to chaos as standard Green troops and ethnic Yue soldiers took to looting and pillaging Taiwan. Given the choice between chaos at the hands of Chinese or submission to the Japanese, the Taipei elite sent Koo Hsien-jung to Keelung to invite the advancing Japanese forces to proceed to Taipei and restore order. 1901 map with red line marking approximate boundary separating territory under actual Japanese administration from \\"Savage District\\" Armed resistance was sporadic, yet at times fierce, but was largely crushed by 1902, although relatively minor rebellions occurred in subsequent years, including the Ta-pa-ni incident of 1915 in Tainan County. Nonviolent means of resistance began to take place of armed rebellions and the most prominent organization was the Taiwanese Cultural Association, founded in 1921. Taiwanese resistance was caused by several different factors (e.g., the Taish≈ç Democracy). Some were goaded by Chinese nationalism, while others contained nascent Taiwanese self-determination. Rebellions were often caused by a combination of the effects of unequal colonial policies on local elites and extant millenarian beliefs of the local Taiwanese and plains Aborigines. Aboriginal resistance to the heavy-handed Japanese policies of acculturation and pacification lasted up until the early 1930s. The last major Aboriginal rebellion, the Musha (Wushe) Uprising in late 1930 by the Atayal people angry over their treatment while laboring in the burdensome job of camphor extraction, launched the last headhunting party in which over 150 Japanese officials were killed and beheaded during the opening ceremonies of a school. The uprising, led by Mona Rudao, was crushed by 2,000‚Äì3,000 Japanese troops and Aboriginal auxiliaries with the help of poison gas. Japanese colonization of the island fell under three stages. It began with an oppressive period of crackdown and paternalistic rule. The second page was a period of aims to treat all people (races) alike proclaimed by Taiwanese Nationalists who were inspired by the Self-Determination of Nations (Ê∞ëÊóèËá™Ê±∫) proposed by Woodrow Wilson after World War I. Finally, during World War II, a period of , a policy which aimed to turn Taiwanese into loyal subjects of the Japanese emperor. Reaction to Japanese rule among the Taiwanese populace differed. Some felt that the safety of personal life and property was of utmost importance and went along with the Japanese colonial authorities. The second group of Taiwanese were eager to become imperial subjects, believing that such action would lead to equal status with Japanese nationals. The third group was influenced by Taiwan independence and tried to get rid of the Japanese colonials to establish a native Taiwanese rule. The fourth group on the other hand were influenced by Chinese nationalism and fought for the return of Taiwan to Chinese rule. From 1897 onwards, this last group staged many rebellions, the most famous one being led by , who was arrested and executed along with two hundred of his comrades in 1913. Luo himself was a member of the Tongmenghui, an organization founded by Sun Yat-sen and was the precursor to the Kuomintang. Several strategies of resistance were undertaken. =Modern development= Bank of Taiwan established in 1897 headquartered in Taihoku (Taipei). Initial infrastructural development took place quickly. The Bank of Taiwan was established in 1899 to encourage Japanese private sectors, including Mitsubishi and the Mitsui Group, to invest in Taiwan. In 1900, the third Governor-General of Taiwan passed a budget which initiated the building of Taiwan's railroad system from Kƒ´run (Keelung) to Takao (Kaohsiung). By 1905 the island had electric power supplied by water power in Nichigetsu Lake (Sun Moon Lake), and in subsequent years Taiwan was considered the second-most developed region of East Asia (after Japan). By 1905, Taiwan was financially self-sufficient and had been weaned off of subsidies from Japan's central government. Under the governor Shimpei Goto's rule, many major public works projects were completed. The Taiwan rail system connecting the south and the north and the modernizations of Kƒ´run and Takao ports were completed to facilitate transport and shipping of raw material and agricultural products. Exports increased by fourfold. 55% of agricultural land was covered by dam- supported irrigation systems. Food production had increased fourfold and sugar cane production had increased 15-fold between 1895 and 1925 and Taiwan became a major foodbasket serving Japan's industrial economy. A health care system was widely established and infectious diseases were almost completely eradicated. The average lifespan for a Taiwanese resident would become 60 years by 1945. Kagi Shrine, one of many Shinto shrines built in Taiwan. In October 1935, the Governor-General of Taiwan held an \\"Exposition to Commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Beginning of Administration in Taiwan\\", which served as a showcase for the achievements of Taiwan's modernization process under Japanese rule. This attracted worldwide attention, including the Republic of China's Kuomintang (KMT) regime which sent the Japanese-educated Chen Yi to attend the affair. He expressed his admiration about the efficiency of Japanese government in developing Taiwan, and commented on how lucky the Taiwanese were to live under such effective administration. Somewhat ironically, Chen Yi would later become the ROC's first Chief Executive of Taiwan, who would be infamous for the corruption that occurred under his watch. The later period of Japanese rule saw a local elite educated and organized. During the 1930s several home rule groups were created at a time when others around the world sought to end colonialism. In 1935, the Taiwanese elected a group of local legislators for the first time. By March 1945, the Japanese legislative branch hastily modified election laws to allow Taiwanese representation in the Japanese Diet. =World War II= The Takasago Volunteers were a unit of the Japanese Army recruited from Taiwanese aboriginal tribes. As Japan embarked on full-scale war in China in 1937, it expanded Taiwan's industrial capacity to manufacture war material. By 1939, industrial production had exceeded agricultural production in Taiwan. At the same time, the \\"k≈çminka\\" imperialization project was put under way to instill the \\"Japanese Spirit\\" in Taiwanese residents, and ensure the Taiwanese would remain loyal subjects of the Japanese Emperor ready to make sacrifices during wartime. Measures including Japanese-language education, the option of adopting Japanese names, and the worship of Japanese religion were instituted. In 1943, 94% of the children received 6-year compulsory education. From 1937 to 1945, 126,750 Taiwanese joined and served in the military of the Japanese Empire, while a further 80,433 were conscripted between 1942 and 1945. Of the sum total, 30,304, or 15%, died in Japan's war in Asia. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwan. The \\"South Strike Group\\" was based out of the Taihoku Imperial University (now National Taiwan University) in Taiwan. Many of the Japanese forces participating in the Aerial Battle of Taiwan- Okinawa were based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military bases and industrial centers throughout Taiwan, like Takao (now Kaohsiung), were targets of heavy American bombing. In 1942, after the United States entered the war against Japan and on the side of China, the Chinese government under the KMT renounced all treaties signed with Japan before that date and made Taiwan's return to China (as with Manchuria, ruled as the Japanese wartime puppet state of \\"Manchukuo\\") one of the wartime objectives. In the Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Allied Powers declared the return of Taiwan (including the Pescadores) to the Republic of China as one of several Allied demands. In 1945, Japan unconditionally surrendered with signing of the instrument of surrender and ended its rule in Taiwan as the territory was put under the administrative control of the Republic of China government in 1945 by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. UNHCR In accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of San Francisco Peace Treaty, the Japanese formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952. At the date when the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into force, the political status of Taiwan and Penghu Islands was still uncertain. The Republic of China and Japan signed the Treaty of Taipei on April 28, 1952 and the treaty came into force on August 5. Writing in the American Journal of International Law, professors Jonathan I. Charney and J. R. V. Prescott argued that \\"none of the post‚ÄìWorld War II peace treaties explicitly ceded sovereignty over the covered territories to any specific state or government.\\"  Republic of China rule  =Taiwan under martial law= Woodcut of the mass killings which took place during the February 28 Incident Beside President Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower waved to crowds during his visit to Taipei in June 1960. The Cairo Conference from November 22‚Äì26, 1943 in Cairo, Egypt was held to address the Allied position against Japan during World War II, and to make decisions about postwar Asia. One of the three main clauses of the Cairo Declaration was that \\"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and The Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China\\". However, many challenged that the document was merely a statement of intent or non-binding declaration, for possible reference used for those who would draft the post-war peace treaty and that as a press release it was without force of law to transfer sovereignty from Taiwan to the Republic of China. Additional rationale to support this claim is that the Act of Surrender, and SCAP General Order no. 1, authorised the surrender of Japanese forces, not Japanese territories. The Republic of China established Taiwan Provincial Government in September 1945„ÄåÂéªÊó•Êú¨Âåñ„Äç„ÄåÂÜç‰∏≠ÂúãÂåñ„ÄçÔºöÊà∞ÂæåÂè∞ÁÅ£ÊñáÂåñÈáçÂª∫Ôºà1945‚Äì1947Ôºâ,Chapter 1. publisher: È∫•Áî∞Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, author: ÈªÉËã±Âì≤, December 19, 2007 and proclaimed on October 25, 1945 as \\"Taiwan Retrocession Day.\\" This is the day in which the Japanese troops surrendered. The validity of the proclamation is subject to some debate, with some supporters of Taiwan independence arguing that it is invalid, and that the date only marks the beginning of military occupation that persists to the present. By 1938 about 309,000 Japanese lived in Taiwan.Formosa (Taiwan) Under Japanese Rule Between the Japanese surrender of Taiwan in 1945 and April 25, 1946, the Republic of China forces repatriated 90% of the Japanese living in Taiwan to Japan. During the immediate postwar period, the Kuomintang (KMT) administration on Taiwan was repressive and extremely corrupt compared with the previous Japanese rule, leading to local discontent. Anti-mainlander violence flared on February 28, 1947, prompted by an incident in which a cigarette seller was injured and a passerby was indiscriminately shot dead by Nationalist authorities. During the ensuing crackdown by the KMT administration in what became known as the February 28 Incident, tens of thousands of people were killed or arrested, and the incident became a taboo topic of discussion for the entire martial law era. From the 1930s onward the Chinese Civil War was underway in mainland China between Chiang Kai-shek's ROC government and the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong. When the Communists gained complete control of Mainland China in 1949, two million refugees, predominantly from the Nationalist government, military, and business community, fled to Taiwan. On October 1, 1949 the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) was founded in mainland China by the victorious communists; several months before, Chiang Kai-shek had established a provisional ROC capital in Taipei and moved his government there from Nanjing. Under Nationalist rule, the mainlanders dominated the government and civil services. =Economic development= The Chinese Civil War led to severe inflation. Currency was issued in denominations of 1 million Old Taiwan dollars. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, post-war economic conditions compounded with the then-ongoing Chinese Civil War caused severe inflation across mainland China and in Taiwan, made worse by disastrous currency reforms and corruption. This gave way to the reconstruction process and new reforms. The KMT took control of Taiwan's monopolies that had been owned by the Japanese prior to World War II. They nationalized approximately 17% of Taiwan's GNP and voided Japanese bond certificates held by Taiwanese investors. These real estate holdings as well as American aid such as the China Aid Act and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction helped to ensure that Taiwan would recover quickly from war. The Kuomintang government also moved the entire gold reserve from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan, and used this reserve to back the newly issued New Taiwan dollar to stabilize the new currency and put a stop to hyperinflation. The KMT authorities implemented a far-reaching and highly successful land reform program on Taiwan during the 1950s. The 375 Rent Reduction Act alleviated tax burden on peasants and another act redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries. Although this left some large landowners impoverished, others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises. These entrepreneurs were to become Taiwan's first industrial capitalists. Together with businessmen who fled from mainland China, they once again revived Taiwan's prosperity previously ceased along with Japanese withdrawal and managed Taiwan's transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy. From 1950 to 1965, Taiwan received a total of $1.5 billion in economic aid and $2.4 billion in military aid from the United States. In 1965 all American aid ceased when Taiwan had established a solid financial base. Having accomplished that, ROC president Chiang Ching-kuo (the son of Chiang Kai-shek) started state projects such as the Ten Major Construction Projects that provided the infrastructure for building a strong export-driven economy. Taiwan has developed steadily into a major international trading power with more than $218 billion in two-way trade and one of the highest foreign exchange reserves in the world. Tremendous prosperity on the island was accompanied by economic and social stability. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the Four Asian Tigers. = Democratic reforms = Until the early 1970s, the Republic of China was recognized as the sole legitimate government of China by the United Nations and most Western nations; who refused to recognize the People's Republic of China on account of the Cold War. The KMT ruled Taiwan under martial law until the late 1980s, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated. The late 1970s and early 1980s were a turbulent time for Chinese people born in Taiwan, as many of the people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The Kaohsiung Incident would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan. Taiwan also faced setbacks in the international sphere. In 1971, the ROC government walked out of the United Nations shortly before it recognized the PRC government in Beijing as the legitimate holder of China's seat in the United Nations. The ROC had been offered dual representation, but Chiang Kai-shek demanded to retain a seat on the UN Security Council, which was not acceptable to the PRC. Chiang expressed his decision in his famous \\"the sky is not big enough for two suns\\" speech. In October 1971, Resolution 2758 was passed by the UN General Assembly and \\"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek\\" (and thus the ROC) were expelled from the UN and replaced as \\"China\\" by the PRC. In 1979, the United States switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek died in April 1975, and was succeeded to the presidency by Yen Chia-kan while his son Chiang Ching-kuo succeeded to the leadership of the Kuomintang (opting to take the title \\"Chairman\\" rather than the elder Chiang's title of \\"Director- General\\"). Formerly the head of the feared secret police, Chiang Ching-kuo recognized gaining foreign support to securing the ROC's future security required reform. His administration saw a gradual loosening of political controls, a transition towards democracy, and moves toward Taiwanization of the regime. Opponents of the Nationalists were no longer forbidden to hold meetings or publish papers. Though opposition political parties were still illegal, when the Democratic Progressive Party was established as the first opposition party in 1986, President Chiang decided against dissolving the group or persecuting its leaders. Its candidates officially ran in elections as independents in the Tangwai movement. In the following year, Chiang ended martial law and allowed family visits to mainland China. Chiang selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwan born technocrat to be his vice president; the first in the line of succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving more power to native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments. After Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, his successor, President Lee Teng-hui, continued to democratize the government. Lee transferred more government authority to Taiwanese born citizens, and Taiwan underwent a process of Taiwanization. In this localization process, local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank instead of the usual Provincial Bank of Taiwan. He also largely suspended the operation of the Taiwan Provincial Government. In 1991 the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly elected in 1947 were forced to resign. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. The restrictions on the use of Taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools were also lifted. However, Lee failed to crack down on the massive corruption that pervaded the government and many KMT loyalists felt that Lee betrayed the ROC by taking reforms too far, while those in the opposition felt he did not take reforms far enough. =Democratic period= Lee ran as the incumbent in Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996 against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. This election prompted the PRC to conduct a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate so that electorates would vote for other pro-unification candidates, Chen Li-an and Lin Yang-kang. The aggressive tactic prompted U.S. President Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch two aircraft carrier battle groups into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation, and PRC's missile tests were forced to end earlier than planned. This incident is known as the 1996 Taiwan Straits Crisis. One of Lee's final acts as president was to declare on German radio that the ROC and the PRC have a special state to state relationship. Lee's statement was met with the PRC's People's Army conducting military drills in Fujian and a frightening island-wide blackout in Taiwan, causing many to fear an attack or cyberattack. The 2000 presidential election marked the end of the Kuomintang (KMT) rule. DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won a three-way race that saw the Pan-Blue vote split by independent James Soong (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. Chen garnered 39% of the vote.Asia Society, \\"Opposition Wins Taiwan Election,\\" (2000) After the election, Soong formed the People First Party (PFP). In 2004, President Chen was re-elected to a second four-year term after an assassination attempt which occurred the day before the election. Two shots were fired, with one bullet grazing the President's belly after penetrating the windshield of a jeep and several layers of clothing and the other bullet penetrated the windshield and hitting the vice president's knee cast. (She was wearing a knee cast due to an earlier injury.) Police investigators have said that the most likely suspect is believed to have been Chen Yi-hsiung, who was later found dead.Reuters, \\"Taiwan election shooting suspect dead,\\" (2005) Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan-Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result. That incident might also have given president Chen the ability to declare a state of emergency and martial law, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue, from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The High Court ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid. During the legislative elections held on December 8, 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier Yu Shyi-kun resigned, and Frank Hsieh assumed premiership on January 25, 2005. In a move that some saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed anti- secession law that allows the use of force on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in Macau between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct cross- strait charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan during the Chinese Lunar New Year Period. In a twist of events, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual reunification with mainland China would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the European Parliament in Brussels urging the European Union not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China. Domestic politics during the Chen administration were largely a political stalemate as the Kuomintang and PFP together held a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that made little progress due to the political stalemate were a stalled arms procurement bill, which would have advanced defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting P-3 Orions, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would have helped in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. The president of the Republic of China, unlike the president of the United States, does not wield veto power, providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority. The constitution was further amended in 2005, creating a two- vote electoral system, with single member plurality seats and proportional representative seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the Legislative Yuan, and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the independence of Taiwan is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the Pan-Green Coalition camp favoring the purchase, and the Pan-Blue Coalition opposing it. Recent allegations about corruption inside the First Family had led to three recall motions votes in the Legislative Yuan aimed at ousting President Chen Shui-bian. All of them had failed since the Pan-Blue Coalition lacked the two- thirds majority required to complete the process and the political parties voted according to political lines. The First Lady, Wu Shu-chen was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal reasons. The president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential immunity. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before President Chen Shui-bian's term was complete.Former first lady Wu to appear in court, China Post In December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in Taipei and Kaohsiung. The KMT retained a clear majority in the capital, while the DPP and the KMT obtained very close results in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Huang Chun-ying lost to Chen Chu by a margin of 0.14 percent; 378,303 votes to 379,417 votes, making Chen Chu the first female mayor of a special municipality in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \\"Taiwan\\", and was rejected by the General Assembly. In 2007, President Chen proposed a policy of Four Wants and One Without, which in substance states that Taiwan wants independence; Taiwan wants the rectification of its name; Taiwan wants a new constitution; Taiwan wants development; and Taiwanese politics is without the question of left or right, but only the question of unification or independence. The reception of this proposed policy in Taiwanese general public was unclear. It, however, was met with a cold reception by both the PRC and the United States. The PRC Foreign Minister emphasised that the Anti-Secession Law was not a piece of unenforceable legislation, while the US Department of State spokesman Sean McCormack described Chen's policy as \\"unhelpful\\". The KMT also retained control of the legislature in the Legislative Yuan elections in January 2008. In the presidential election in May 2008, KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms, and defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh with 58.48% of the vote. On the same day President Chen left office, losing presidential immunity, the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced that they were launching an inquiry into corruption charges regarding Chen.Taiwan ex-leader faces graft case Later in 2008, members of his administration, including Chiou I-jen, a former National Security Council secretary-general, and Yeh Sheng-mao, former director-general of the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, were arrested on corruption charges. Chiou I-jen was found not guilty,High Court finds Chiou I-jen not guilty Taipei Times while Yeh Sheng-mao was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Ma was re-elected, and the KMT retained its majority in the Legislative Yuan, in combined elections in January 2012. In March and April 2014, students protesting against undemocratic methods used by the KMT occupied the parliament building. In the end, the government agreed to put on hold the ratification of an agreement with China which they had pushed through without proper debate. This event had far reaching consequences, and changed the mood of the electorate. In the combined elections in January 2016 the opposition candidate for President, Tsai Ing-wen, of the DPP won with 56% of the vote, and the opposition DPP was catapulted into an outright majority in the parliament. The election marked the first time a non-KMT party won a majority in the legislature. The elections held on November 24, 2018 resulted in a major setback for the DPP majority and led to President Tsai Ing-wen resignation as leader of the party. The DPP lost a total of nine legislative seats, giving the KMT control of the majority of the 22 seats. KMT mayoral candidates won in New Taipei City, Taichung and Kaohsiung, the latter of which has been a political stronghold for the DPP for 20 years.

He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the United States and then as \\"Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini\\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it. In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts. Houdini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money. He was also a keen aviator and aimed to become the first man to fly a plane in Australia. Early life Erik Weisz was born in Budapest to a Jewish family. His parents were Rabbi Mayer S√°muel Weisz (1829‚Äì1892) and Cec√≠lia Steiner (1841‚Äì1913). Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863‚Äì1885) who was Houdini's half-brother by Rabbi Weisz's first marriage; Nathan J. (1870‚Äì1927); Gottfried William (1872‚Äì1925); Theodore (1876‚Äì1945); Leopold D. (1879‚Äì1962); and Carrie Gladys (1882‚Äì1959),Meyer, Bernard C. (1976), Houdini: A Mind in Chains, E.P. Dutton & Co., Chapter 1, p. 5, . who was left almost blind after a childhood accident. Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers.US National Archives Microfilm serial: M237; Microfilm roll: 413; Line: 38; List number: 684. The family changed their name to the German spelling Weiss, and Erik became Ehrich. The family lived in Appleton, Wisconsin, where his father served as Rabbi of the Zion Reform Jewish Congregation. According to the 1880 census, the family lived on Appleton Street in an area that is now known as Houdini Square.1880 US Census with Samuel M. Weiss, Cecelia (wife), Armin M., Nathan J., Ehrich, Theodore, and Leopold. On June 6, 1882, Rabbi Weiss became an American citizen. Losing his job at Zion in 1882, Rabbi Weiss and family moved to Milwaukee and fell into dire poverty.Houdini's Forgotten Years The Houdini File. In 1887, Rabbi Weiss moved with Ehrich to New York City, where they lived in a boarding house on East 79th Street. He was joined by the rest of the family once Rabbi Weiss found permanent housing. As a child, Ehrich Weiss took several jobs, making his public d√©but as a nine-year-old trapeze artist, calling himself \\"Ehrich, the Prince of the Air\\". He was also a champion cross country runner in his youth. Magic career When Weiss became a professional magician he began calling himself \\"Harry Houdini\\", after the French magician Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, after reading Robert-Houdin's autobiography in 1890. Weiss incorrectly believed that an i at the end of a name meant \\"like\\" in French. In later life, Houdini claimed that the first part of his new name, Harry, was an homage to Harry Kellar, whom he also admired, though it was more likely adapted from \\"Ehri\\", a nickname for \\"Ehrich\\", which is how he was known to his family. Also at Biography In Context. When he was a teenager, Houdini was coached by the magician Joseph Rinn at the Pastime Athletic Club. Houdini, c. 1900 Houdini began his magic career in 1891, but had little success. He appeared in a tent act with strongman Emil Jarrow.Immerso, Michael. (2002). Coney Island: The People's Playground. Rutgers University Press. p. 114. He performed in dime museums and sideshows, and even doubled as \\"The Wild Man\\" at a circus. Houdini focused initially on traditional card tricks. At one point, he billed himself as the \\"King of Cards\\". Some ‚Äì but not all ‚Äì professional magicians would come to regard Houdini as a competent but not particularly skilled sleight-of-hand artist, lacking the grace and finesse required to achieve excellence in that craft.Houdini, King of Cards The Houdini Files. He soon began experimenting with escape acts. In 1894, while performing with his brother \\"Dash\\" (Theodore) at Coney Island as \\"The Brothers Houdini\\", Houdini met a fellow performer, Wilhelmina Beatrice \\"Bess\\" Rahner. Bess was initially courted by Dash, but she and Houdini married, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as \\"The Houdinis\\". For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant. Houdini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager Martin Beck in St. Paul, Minnesota. Impressed by Houdini's handcuffs act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe. After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini's British agent Harry Day helped him to get an interview with C. Dundas Slater, then manager of the Alhambra Theatre. He was introduced to William Melville and gave a demonstration of escape from handcuffs at Scotland Yard.Gresham, William Lindsay. (1959). Houdini: The Man Who Walked Through Walls. Holt. pp. 82‚Äì83 He succeeded in baffling the police so effectively that he was booked at the Alhambra for six months. His show was an immediate hit and his salary rose to $300 a week.Price, David. (1985). Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater. Cornwall Books. p. 191. \\"My Two Sweethearts\\"‚ÄîHoudini with his mother and wife, 1907 Between 1900 and 1920 he appeared in theatres all over Great Britain performing escape acts, illusions, card tricks and outdoor stunts, becoming one of the world's highest paid entertainers.Tait,Derek. (2017). The Great Houdini: His British Tours (Kindle Edition). Pen&Sword; Books Ltd. Chapter One He also toured the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia and became widely known as \\"The Handcuff King\\". In each city, Houdini challenged local police to restrain him with shackles and lock him in their jails. In many of these challenge escapes, he was first stripped nude and searched. In Moscow, he escaped from a Siberian prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept. In Cologne, he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via bribery.Silverman, p. 81. Houdini won the case when he opened the judge's safe (he later said the judge had forgotten to lock it). With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for Queen Victoria. He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives. Houdini said it was the happiest day of his life. In 1904, Houdini returned to the U.S. and purchased a house for $25,000 (), a brownstone at 278 W. 113th Street in Harlem, New York City.Silverman, p. 109. While on tour in Europe in 1902, Houdini visited Blois with the aim of meeting the widow of Emile Houdin, the son of Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, for an interview and permission to visit his grave. He did not receive permission but still visited the grave.Steinmeyer, Jim. (2004). Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible. Da Capo Press. pp. 152‚Äì153. Houdini believed that he had been treated unfairly and later wrote a negative account of the incident in his magazine, claiming he was \\"treated most discourteously by Madame W. Emile Robert-Houdin\\". In 1906, he sent a letter to the French magazine L'Illusionniste stating: \\"You will certainly enjoy the article on Robert Houdin I am about to publish in my magazine. Yes, my dear friend, I think I can finally demolish your idol, who has so long been placed on a pedestal that he did not deserve.\\"Jones, Graham Matthew. (2007). Trades of the Trick: Conjuring Culture in Modern France. New York University. pp. 96‚Äì98 In 1906, Houdini created his own publication, the Conjurers' Monthly Magazine.Gresham, William Lindsay (1959). Houdini: The Man Who Walked Through Walls. Holt. p. 136 It was a competitor to The Sphinx, but was short-lived and only two volumes were released until August 1908. Magic historian Jim Steinmeyer has noted that \\"Houdini couldn't resist using the journal for his own crusades, attacking his rivals, praising his own appearances, and subtly rewriting history to favor his view of magic.\\"Steinmeyer, Jim. (2006). The Glorious Deception: The Double Life of William Robinson, Aka Chung Ling Soo, the Marvelous Chinese Conjurer. Da Capo Press. p. 291. From 1907 and throughout the 1910s, Houdini performed with great success in the United States. He freed himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and straitjackets, often while hanging from a rope in sight of street audiences. Because of imitators, Houdini put his \\"handcuff act\\" behind him on January 25, 1908, and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can. The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences. Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him. These included nailed packing crates (sometimes lowered into water), riveted boilers, wet sheets, mail bags, and even the belly of a whale that had washed ashore in Boston. Brewers in Scranton, Pennsylvania and other cities challenged Houdini to escape from a barrel after they filled it with beer. Many of these challenges were arranged with local merchants in one of the first uses of mass tie-in marketing. Rather than promote the idea that he was assisted by spirits, as did the Davenport Brothers and others, Houdini's advertisements showed him making his escapes via dematerializing, although Houdini himself never claimed to have supernatural powers. After much research, Houdini wrote a collection of articles on the history of magic, which were expanded into The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin published in 1908. In this book he attacked his former idol Robert-Houdin as a liar and a fraud for having claimed the invention of automata and effects such as aerial suspension, which had been in existence for many years.Steinmeyer, Jim. (2004). Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible. Da Capo Press. pp. 154‚Äì155. \\"He decided to portray Robert-Houdin as a liar and thief who was completely incompetent as a magician. Houdini had developed a hatred for his spiritual father. In 1908 his collection of articles was gathered together, expanded and sold to a London publisher. By comparing the original articles with the finished book, it's clear that Houdini employed a ghost writer to polish the language and clarify his points. Other surviving manuscripts from Houdini demonstrate that most of Houdini's writing depended on ghostwriters. The theme of his book on Robert-Houdin was sharpened to a razor's edge, and was now titled The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin.\\"Goto-Jones, Chris. (2016). Conjuring Asia. Cambridge University Press. p. 193. Many of the allegations in the book were dismissed by magicians and researchers who defended Robert-Houdin. Magician Jean Hugard would later write a full rebuttal to Houdini's book.Inge, M. Thomas; Hall, Dennis. (2002). The Greenwood Guide to American Popular Culture, Volume 3. Greenwood Press. p. 1037. \\"Stung by the refusal of the widow of Robert-Houdin's son Emile to receive him in 1901, Houdini launched a literary vendetta against his former hero in the form of a book, The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin, published seven years later. While the book did not achieve its aim, it remains of considerable historical interest as the first sustained attempt to mine Houdini's large and growing collection for historical information. Its errors and oversights became the subject of two extensive rebuttals. The first was Maurice Sardina's Les Erreurs de Harry Houdini, translated and edited by Victor Farelli as Where Houdini Was Wrong. The second was Jean Hugard's Houdini's \\"Unmasking\\": Fact vs Fiction.Steinmeyer, Jim. (2004). Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible. Da Capo Press. p. 156. \\"A number of researchers and authors have dismissed his claims and defended Robert-Houdin's reputation.\\"Jones, Graham M. (2011). Trade of the Tricks: Inside the Magician's Craft. University of California Press. p. 208. \\"The publication ultimately did more to tarnish Houdini's reputation than to refute Robert-Houdin's claims to originality and distinction especially in France, where magicians rallied to defend their spiritual progenitor against aspersions cast by an American parvenu.\\" Poster promoting Houdini taking up the challenge of escaping an \\"extra strong and large traveling basket\\" In 1913, Houdini introduced the Chinese Water Torture Cell, in which he was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, holding his breath for more than three minutes. He would go on performing this escape for the rest of his life. During his career, Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood. In Handcuff Secrets (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings. Other times, he carried concealed lockpicks or keys. When tied down in ropes or straitjackets, he gained wiggle room by enlarging his shoulders and chest, moving his arms slightly away from his body. Houdini and Jennie, the Vanishing Elephant, January 7, 1918 Houdini in handcuffs, 1918 His straitjacket escape was originally performed behind curtains, with him popping out free at the end. Houdini's brother (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as Theodore Hardeen) discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down from the roof of a building in the same city. For most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in vaudeville. For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville. One of Houdini's most notable non-escape stage illusions was performed at the New York Hippodrome, when he vanished a full-grown elephant from the stage.\\"The Vanishing Elephant\\". Retrieved June 30, 2016. He had purchased this trick from the magician Charles Morritt.Christopher, Milbourne. (1990 edition, originally published in 1962). Magic: A Picture History. Dover Publications. p. 160. \\"Morritt invented a 'Disappearing Donkey'. When he expanded the idea so that an elephant could be whisked away in a box, Houdini bought the full rights to the spectacular illusion.\\"Silverman, p. 224. In 1923, Houdini became president of Martinka & Co., America's oldest magic company. The business is still in operation today. He also served as President of the Society of American Magicians ( S.A.M.) from 1917 until his death in 1926. Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of Martinka's magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917 to 1926. Houdini was magic's greatest visionary. He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, he gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. He said \\"The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak ... but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worthwhile. Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables.\\" For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini had been recruiting‚Äîat his own expense‚Äîlocal magic clubs to join the S.A.M. in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, he persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold. By the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world. It now embraces almost 6,000 dues- paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year. He also was President of the Magicians' Club of London. In the final years of his life (1925/26), Houdini launched his own full-evening show, which he billed as \\"Three Shows in One: Magic, Escapes, and Fraud Mediums Exposed\\". Notable escapes =Mirror challenge= \\"Handcuff\\" Harry Houdini, c. 1905 In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matin√©e performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the six-inch key.The Secret Life of Houdini, Kaulush & Sloman, 2006. Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career. Reproduction in full of Daily Mirror article \\"Houdini's Great Victory\\", March 18, 1904. After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was six inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.Silverman, pp. 59‚Äì62. This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum. A full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for it, is on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display. =Milk Can Escape= In 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the Milk Can Escape.Randi, pp. 175‚Äì178. In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain. As part of the effect, Houdini invited members of the audience to hold their breath along with him while he was inside the can. Advertised with dramatic posters that proclaimed \\"Failure Means A Drowning Death\\", the escape proved to be a sensation.Randi, Milk Can poster on page 177. Houdini soon modified the escape to include the milk can being locked inside a wooden chest, being chained or padlocked. Houdini performed the milk can escape as a regular part of his act for only four years, but it has remained one of the acts most associated with him. Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, continued to perform the milk can escape and its wooden chest variant into the 1940s. The American Museum of Magic has the milk can and overboard box used by Houdini. After lesser magicians proposed variations on the Milk Can Escape, Houdini claimed that the act was copyrighted and settled out of court in 1906 a case with John Clempert, one of the most persistent imitators, who agreed to publish an apology. =Chinese water torture cell= Houdini performing the Chinese Water Torture Cell Around 1912, the vast number of imitators prompted Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult ‚Äì the cage prevented Houdini from turning ‚Äì the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called \\"Houdini Upside Down\\". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as \\"The Chinese Water Torture Cell\\" or \\"The Water Torture Cell\\", Houdini always referred to it as \\"the Upside Down\\" or \\"USD\\". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926. =Suspended straitjacket escape= One of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his escape in full view of the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the subway. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty- seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.\\"Thousands see Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while hanging in mid-air, Chicago, Ill.\\", International news [1923 or 1924?] Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named Randolph Osborne Douglas (March 31, 1895 ‚Äì December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at Sheffield's Empire Theatre. =Overboard box escape= Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape c. 1912 Another of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside. Houdini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a tank was specially built, and later at the New York Hippodrome. =Buried alive stunt= Houdini performed at least three variations on a buried alive stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was \\"very dangerous\\" and that \\"the weight of the earth is killing\\". Houdini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.Silverman, pp. 397‚Äì403. He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes. Houdini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting \\"Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!\\"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on Halloween.Silverman, p. 406. Movie career Silent movie The Master Mystery (1919). Running time: 09:39. Episode of a serial in fifteen episodes with magician and escape artist Houdini in the lead In 1906, Houdini started showing films of his outside escapes as part of his vaudeville act. In Boston, he presented a short film called Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt. Georg Hackenschmidt was a famous wrestler of the day, but the nature of their contest is unknown as the film is lost. In 1909, Houdini made a film in Paris for Cinema Lux titled Merveilleux Exploits du C√©l√©bre Houdini √† Paris (Marvellous Exploits of the Famous Houdini in Paris).Disappearing Tricks by Matthew Solomon, 2010, p. 95. It featured a loose narrative designed to showcase several of Houdini's famous escapes, including his straitjacket and underwater handcuff escapes. That same year Houdini got an offer to star as Captain Nemo in a silent version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but the project never made it into production.Silverman, p. 205. It is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, The Mysteries of Myra, shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of The Master Mystery also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time. The consultants on the serial were pioneering Hereward Carrington and Aleister Crowley. In 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer B. A. Rolfe to star in a 15-part serial, The Master Mystery (released in November 1918). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in B. A. Rolfe Productions going out of business, but The Master Mystery led to Houdini being signed by Famous Players-Lasky Corporation/Paramount Pictures, for whom he made two pictures, The Grim Game (1919) and Terror Island (1920). The Grim Game was Houdini's first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best. Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and their low rate of survival, film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector. After many years of trying, they finally got him to agree to sell the film to Turner Classic Movies who restored the complete 71-minute film. The film, not seen by the general public for 96 years was shown by TCM on March 29, 2015, as a highlight of their yearly 4-day festival in Hollywood. Houdini swims above Niagara Falls in a scene from The Man from Beyond (1922) While filming an aerial stunt for The Grim Game, two biplanes collided in mid-air with a stuntman doubling Houdini dangling by a rope from one of the planes. Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic \\"caught on film\\" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in Laurel Canyon. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the \\"Houdini Picture Corporation\\". He produced and starred in two films, The Man from Beyond (1921) and Haldane of the Secret Service (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician Harry Kellar was a major investor.Silverman, pp. 226‚Äì249. Neither Houdini's acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that \\"the profits are too meager\\". In April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdini's surviving silent films, including The Master Mystery, Terror Island, The Man From Beyond, Haldane of the Secret Service, and five minutes from The Grim Game. The set also includes newsreel footage of Houdini's escapes from 1907 to 1923, and a section from Merveilleux Exploits du C√©l√©bre Houdini √† Paris, although it is not identified as such. Aviator In 1909, Houdini became fascinated with aviation. He purchased a French Voisin biplane for $5,000 and hired a full-time mechanic, Antonio Brassac. After crashing once, he made his first successful flight on November 26 in Hamburg, Germany. The following year, Houdini toured Australia. He brought along his Voisin biplane with the intention to be the first person in Australia to fly. = Falsely reported as pioneer = On March 18, 1910, he made three flights at Diggers Rest, Victoria, near Melbourne. It was reported at the time that this was the first aerial flight in Australia, and a century later, some major news outlets still credit him with this feat.Entertainment Houdini's flight into history. Weekly Times Now (March 18, 2010). Retrieved February 28, 2012. Wing Commander Harry Cobby wrote in Aircraft in March 1938 that \\"the first aeroplane flight in the Southern Hemisphere was made on December 9, 1909 by Mr Colin Defries, a Londoner, at Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney, in a Wilbur Wright aeroplane\\".While this was possibly the first flight in Australia, the first flight in the Southern Hemisphere was probably made by Richard Pearse in New Zealand several years earlier, either in 1903 or 1904. Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France. By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had accumulated enough to become an instructor. On his first flight he took off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely. His crash landing on his second flight, when he tried to retrieve his hat which was blown off, demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a Wright Model A. It is accepted by Australian historiansThe Powerhouse Museum is the major branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney.

Retrieved February 28, 2012. and the Aviation Historical Society of Australia that the definition of flight established by the Gorell Committee on behalf of the Aero Club of Great Britain dictates the acceptance of a flight or its rejection, giving Colin Defries credit as the first to make an aeroplane flight in Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, aviation pioneer Richard Pearse is believed by many New Zealand historians to have undertaken his first flight as early as 1902, which would give him not only the Southern Hemisphere but the World record, although this is disputed. In 1965, aviation journalist Stanley Brogden formed the view that the first powered flight in Australia took place at Bolivar in South Australia; the aircraft was a Bleriot monoplane with Fred Custance as the pilot. The flight took place on March 17, 1910. The next day when Houdini took to the air, the Herald newspaper reported Custance's flight, stating it had lasted 5 minutes 25 seconds at a height of between 12 and 15 feet. In 2010, Australia Post issued stamps commemorating Colin Defries, Houdini and John Robertson Duigan, crediting only Defries and Duigan with historical firsts.Australia Post ‚Äì Harry Houdini can't escape being part of Australia's history.

Australia Post did acknowledge the part Houdini played (Harry Houdini can't escape being part of Australia's history) but did not attribute any record to him. =After Australia= After completing his Australia tour, Houdini put the Voisin into storage in England. He announced he would use it to fly from city to city during his next Music Hall tour, and even promised to leap from it handcuffed, but he never flew again.Silverman, pp. 137‚Äì154. Debunking spiritualists Houdini demonstrates how a photographer could produce fraudulent \\"spirit photographs\\" that documented the apparition and social interaction of the dead In the 1920s, Houdini turned his energies toward debunking psychics and mediums, a pursuit that inspired and was followed by latter-day stage magicians. Houdini's training in magic allowed him to expose frauds who had successfully fooled many scientists and academics. He was a member of a Scientific American committee that offered a cash prize to any medium who could successfully demonstrate supernatural abilities. None were able to do so, and the prize was never collected. The first to be tested was medium George Valiantine of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. As his fame as a \\"ghostbuster\\" grew, Houdini took to attending s√©ances in disguise, accompanied by a reporter and police officer. Possibly the most famous medium whom he debunked was Mina Crandon, also known as \\"Margery\\". Joaqu√≠n Argamasilla known as the \\"Spaniard with X-ray Eyes\\" claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. In 1924, he was exposed by Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted up the edge of the box so he could look inside it without others noticing.Nickell, Joe (2007). Adventures in Paranormal Investigation. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 213‚Äì215. Houdini also investigated the Italian medium Nino Pecoraro, whom he considered to be fraudulent.Polidoro, Massimo. (2001). Final S√©ance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. pp. 127‚Äì128. Houdini's exposing of phony mediums has inspired other magicians to follow suit, including The Amazing Randi, Dorothy Dietrich, Penn & Teller, and Dick Brookz. Houdini chronicled his debunking exploits in his book, A Magician Among the Spirits, co-authored with C. M. Eddy, Jr., who was not credited. These activities cost Houdini the friendship of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle, a firm believer in spiritualism during his later years, refused to believe any of Houdini's expos√©s. Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was \\"debunking\\".see Conan Doyle's The Edge of The Unknown, published in 1931. This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy. Before Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message \\"Rosabelle believe\\", a secret code which they agreed to use. Rosabelle was their favorite song. Bess held yearly s√©ances on Halloween for ten years after Houdini's death. She did claim to have contact through Arthur Ford in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked. The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues. Evidence to this effect was discovered by Ford's biographer after he died in 1971. In 1936, after a last unsuccessful s√©ance on the roof of the Knickerbocker Hotel, she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death. In 1943, Bess said that \\"ten years is long enough to wait for any man.\\" The tradition of holding a s√©ance for Houdini continues, held by magicians throughout the world. The Official Houdini S√©ance was organized in the 1940s by Sidney Hollis Radner, a Houdini aficionado from Holyoke, Massachusetts.Houdini Facts . Yearly Houdini s√©ances are also conducted in Chicago at the Excalibur nightclub by \\"necromancer\\" Neil Tobin on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the Society of American Magicians; and at the Houdini Museum in Scranton by magician Dorothy Dietrich, who previously held them at New York's Magic Towne House with such magical notables as Houdini biographers Walter B. Gibson and Milbourne Christopher. Gibson was asked by Bess Houdini to carry on the original seance tradition. After doing them for many years at New York's Magic Towne House, before he died, Walter passed on the tradition of conducting of the Original Seances to Dorothy Dietrich. In 1926, Harry Houdini hired H. P. Lovecraft and his friend C. M. Eddy, Jr., to write an entire book about debunking religious miracles, which was to be called The Cancer of Superstition. Houdini had earlier asked Lovecraft to write an article about astrology, for which he paid $75. The article does not survive. Lovecraft's detailed synopsis for Cancer does survive, as do three chapters of the treatise written by Eddy. Houdini's death derailed the plans, as his widow did not wish to pursue the project. Appearance and voice recordings Heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey mock- punching Houdini (held back by lightweight boxer Benny Leonard)Unlike the image of the classic magician, Houdini was short and stocky and typically appeared on stage in a long frock coat and tie. Most biographers give his height as , but descriptions vary. Houdini was also said to be slightly bow- legged, which aided in his ability to gain slack during his rope escapes. In the 1997 biography Houdini!!!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss, author Kenneth Silverman summarizes how reporters described Houdini's appearance during his early career: Houdini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison wax cylinders on October 29, 1914, in Flatbush, New York. On them, Houdini practices several different introductory speeches for his famous Chinese Water Torture Cell. He also invites his sister, Gladys, to recite a poem. Houdini then recites the same poem in German. The six wax cylinders were discovered in the collection of magician John Mulholland after his death in 1970. They are part of the David Copperfield collection. Personal life Houdini became an active Freemason and was a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568 in New York City. In 1904, Houdini bought a New York City townhouse at 278 West 113th Street in Harlem. He paid US$25,000 for the five-level, 6,008-square-foot house, which was built in 1895, and lived in it with his wife Bess, and various other relatives until his death in 1926. In March 2018, it was purchased for $3.6 million. A plaque affixed to the building by the Historical Landmark Preservation Center reads, \\"The magician lived here from 1904 to 1926 collecting illusions, theatrical memorabilia, and books on psychic phenomena and magic.\\" In 1918, he registered for selective service as Harry Handcuff Houdini. Death Bess Harry Houdini died of peritonitis, secondary to a ruptured appendix, at 1:26 p.m. on October 31, 1926, in Room 401 at Detroit's Grace Hospital, aged 52. In his final days, he believed that he would recover, but his last words before dying were reportedly, \\"I'm tired of fighting... I do not want to fight anymore...\\" Witnesses to an incident at Houdini's dressing room in the Princess Theatre in Montreal speculated that Houdini's death was caused by a McGill University student, Jocelyn Gordon Whitehead (b. 1895 ‚Äì d. 1954), who repeatedly struck Houdini's abdomen. The accounts of the witnesses, students named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), generally corroborated one another. Price said that Whitehead asked Houdini \\"if he believed in the miracles of the Bible\\" and \\"whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him\\". Houdini offered a casual reply that his stomach could endure a lot. Whitehead then delivered \\"some very hammer-like blows below the belt\\". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price said that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had had enough, and adding that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself. Throughout the evening, Houdini performed in great pain. He was unable to sleep and remained in constant pain for the next two days, but did not seek medical help. When he finally saw a doctor, he was found to have a fever of and acute appendicitis, and was advised to have immediate surgery. He ignored the advice and decided to go on with the show. When Houdini arrived at the Garrick Theater in Detroit, Michigan, on October 24, 1926, for what would be his last performance, he had a fever of . Despite the diagnosis, Houdini took the stage. He was reported to have passed out during the show, but was revived and continued. Afterwards, he was hospitalized at Detroit's Grace Hospital. It is unclear whether the dressing room incident caused Houdini's eventual death, as the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is uncertain. One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis, and might have been aware had he not received blows to the abdomen. After taking statements from Price and Smilovitz, Houdini's insurance company concluded that the death was due to the dressing-room incident and paid double indemnity. Houdini grave site Houdini's funeral was held on November 4, 1926, in New York, with more than 2,000 mourners in attendance. He was interred in the Machpelah Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, with the crest of the Society of American Magicians inscribed on his grave site. A statuary bust was added to the exedra in 1927, a rarity, because graven images are forbidden in Jewish cemeteries. In 1975, the bust was destroyed by vandals. Temporary busts were placed at the grave until 2011 when a group who came to be called The Houdini Commandos from the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania placed a permanent bust with the permission of Houdini's family and of the cemetery. The Society of American Magicians took responsibility for the upkeep of the site, as Houdini had willed a large sum of money to the organization he had grown from one club to 5,000‚Äì6,000 dues-paying membership worldwide. The payment of upkeep was abandoned by the society's dean George Schindler, who said \\"Houdini paid for perpetual care, but there's nobody at the cemetery to provide it\\", adding that the operator of the cemetery, David Jacobson, \\"sends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it because he never provides any care.\\" Members of the Society tidy the grave themselves. Machpelah Cemetery operator Jacobson said, they \\"never paid the cemetery for any restoration of the Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988\\", claiming that the money came from the cemetery's dwindling funds. The granite monuments of Houdini's sister, Gladys, and brother, Leopold were also destroyed by vandals. For many years, until recently, the Houdini grave site has been only cared for by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Society of American Magicians, at its National Council Meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, in 2013, under the prompting of The Houdini Museum's Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz, voted to assume the financial responsibilities for the care and maintenance of the Houdini Gravesite. In MUM Magazine, the Society's official magazine, President Dal Sanders announced \\"Harry Houdini is an icon as revered as Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe. He is not only a magical icon; his gravesite bears the seal of The Society of American Magicians. That seal is our brand and we should be proud to protect it. This gravesite is clearly our responsibility and I'm proud to report that the National Council unanimously voted to maintain Houdini's final resting place.\\" The Houdini Gravesite Restoration Committee under the Chairmanship of National President David Bowers, is working closely with National President Kenrick \\"Ice\\" McDonald to see this project to completion. Bowers said it is a foregone conclusion that the Society will approve the funding request, because \\"Houdini is responsible for the Society of American Magicians being what it is today. We owe a debt of gratitude to him.\\" Like Bowers, McDonald said the motivation behind the repairs is to properly honor the grave of the \\"Babe Ruth of magicians\\". \\"This is hallowed ground,\\" he said. \\"When you ask people about magicians, the first thing they say is Harry Houdini.\\" While the actual plot will remain under the control of Machpelah Cemetery management, the Society of American Magicians, with the help of the Houdini Museum in Pennsylvania, will be in charge of the restoration. Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz have been caring for the escape artist's Queens grave over the years. \\"This is a monument where people go and visit on a daily basis,\\" said Dietrich who is spearheading restoration efforts. \\"The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years.\\" \\"The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, one of the oldest fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift.\\" The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Society's attention. Kenrick \\"Ice\\" McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said \\"You have to know the history. Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926. Houdini's burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory.\\" Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost \\"tens of thousands of dollars\\", after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans. \\"It's a wonderful project, but it's taken a lifetime to get people interested,\\" she said. \\"It's long overdue, and it's great that it's happening.\\" Houdini was a living superhero,\\" Dietrich said. \\"He wasn't just a magician and escape artist, he was a great humanitarian.\\" To this day, the Society holds a broken wand ceremony at the grave every November. Houdini's widow, Bess, died of a heart attack on February 11, 1943, aged 67, in Needles, California while on a train en route from Los Angeles to New York City. She had expressed a wish to be buried next to her husband, but instead was interred 35 miles due north at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Westchester County, New York, as her Catholic family refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. =Proposed exhumation= On March 22, 2007, Houdini's grand-nephew (the grandson of his brother Theo), George Hardeen, announced that the courts would be asked to allow exhumation of Houdini's body, to investigate the possibility of Houdini being murdered by spiritualists, as suggested in the biography The Secret Life of Houdini. In a statement given to the Houdini Museum in Scranton, the family of Bess Houdini opposed the application and suggested it was a publicity ploy for the book. The Washington Post stated that the press conference was not arranged by the family of Houdini. Instead, the Post reported, it was orchestrated by authors Kalush and Sloman, who hired the PR firm Dan Klores Communications to promote their book. In 2008, it was revealed the parties involved never filed legal papers to perform an exhumation. Legacy Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, who returned to performing after Houdini's death, inherited his brother's effects and props. Houdini's will stipulated that all the effects should be \\"burned and destroyed\\" upon Hardeen's death. Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast Sidney Hollis Radner during the 1940s, including the water torture cell. Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in Niagara Falls, Ontario. In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum. The water torture cell's metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan. Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdini's original packing crate, a milk can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008. Radner loaned the bulk of his collection for archiving to the Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wisconsin but reclaimed it in 2003 and auctioned it in Las Vegas, on October 30, 2004. Houdini was a \\"formidable collector\\", and bequeathed many of his holdings and paper archives on magic and spiritualism to the Library of Congress, which became the basis for the Houdini collection in cyberspace. In 1934, the bulk of Houdini's collection of American and British theatrical material, along with a significant portion of his business and personal papers, and some of his collections of other magicians were sold to pay off estate debts to theatre magnate Messmore Kendall. In 1958, Kendall donated his collection to the Hoblitzelle Theatre Library at the University of Texas at Austin. In the 1960s, the Hoblitzelle Library became part of the Harry Ransom Center. The extensive Houdini collection includes a 1584 first edition of Reginald Scot's Discoverie of Witchcraft and David Garrick's travel diary to Paris from 1751. Some of the scrapbooks in the Houdini collection have been digitized. The collection was exclusively paper-based until April 2016, when the Ransom Center acquired one of Houdini's ball weights with chain and ankle cuff. In October 2016, in conjunction with the 90th anniversary of the death of Houdini, the Ransom Center embarked on a major re-cataloging of the Houdini collection to make it more visible and accessible to researchers. The collection reopened in 2018, with its finding aids posted online. A large portion of Houdini's estate holdings and memorabilia was willed to his fellow magician and friend, John Mulholland (1898‚Äì1970). In 1991, illusionist and television performer David Copperfield purchased all of Mulholland's Houdini holdings from Mulholland's estate. These are now archived and preserved in Copperfield's warehouse at his headquarters in Las Vegas. It contains the world's largest collection of Houdini memorabilia, and preserves approximately 80,000 items of memorabilia of Houdini and other magicians, including Houdini's stage props and material, his rebuilt water torture cabinet and his metamorphosis trunk. It is not open to the public, but tours are available by invitation to magicians, scholars, researchers, journalists and serious collectors. In a posthumous ceremony on October 31, 1975, Houdini was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7001 Hollywood Blvd. The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, bills itself as \\"the only building in the world entirely dedicated to Houdini\\". It is open to the public year-round by reservation. It includes Houdini films, a guided tour about Houdini's life and a stage magic show. Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz opened the facility in 1991. The Magic Castle in Los Angeles, California, a nightclub for magicians and magic enthusiasts, as well as the clubhouse for the Academy of Magical Arts, features Houdini s√©ances performed by magician Misty Lee. The House of Houdini is a museum and performance venue located at 11, D√≠sz square in the Buda Castle in Budapest, Hungary. It claims to house the largest collection of original Houdini artifacts in Europe. The Houdini Museum of New York is located at Fantasma Magic, a retail magic manufacturer and seller located in Manhattan. The museum contains several hundred pieces of ephemera, most of which belonged to Harry Houdini.  In popular culture  * Houdini appeared as himself in Weird Tales magazine in three ghostwritten fictionalizations of sensational events from his career (issues of March, April, and May‚ÄìJune‚ÄìJuly 1924). The third story, \\"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs,\\" was written by horror writer H. P. Lovecraft based on Houdini's notes. The Houdini-Lovecraft collaboration was envisioned to continue, but the magazine ceased publication for financial reasons. When it resumed later in 1924, Houdini no longer figured in its plans.\\"The Magician's Ghostwriters\\" in The Thing's Incredible!

Stand-ins are helpful in the initial processes of film and television production. Stand-ins allow the director of photography to light the set and the camera department to light and focus scenes while the actors are absent. The director will often ask stand-ins to deliver the scene dialogue (\\"lines\\") and walk through (\\"blocking\\") the scenes to be filmed. Stand-ins are distinguished from body doubles, who replace actors on camera from behind, in makeup, or during dangerous stunts. Stand-ins do not appear on camera. However, on some productions the jobs of stand-in and double may be done by the same person. In rare cases, a stand-in will appear on screen, sometimes as an in-joke. For instance, the actress who pretends to be Ann Darrow in the stage show during the final act of King Kong (2005) is played by Naomi Watts' stand-in, Julia Walshaw. Stand-ins do not necessarily look like the actor, but they must have the same skin tone, hair color, height and build as the actor so that the lighting in a scene will be set up correctly. For example, if the lighting is set up with a stand-in shorter than an actor, the actor might end up having his or her head in relative darkness. Stand-ins are also used for animated characters in a live-action film, sometimes with life-size character models, so that the animators know where to place their animation and how to make them move realistically, and for actors to know where to look. In these cases, skin tone and hair color are not so important. Height and build, however, are still important for any interactions between live-action and animated characters. Some celebrities mandate that they will always have the same stand-in. Famous cases include Pluma Noisom (stand-in for Claudette Colbert), Harry Cornbleth (Fred Astaire) and Adam Bryant (Robin Williams). When Bette Davis walked out on her Warner Bros. contract, she negotiated for her regular stand-in, Sally Sage, to continue to work at the studio.

Usually, an esolang's creators do not intend the language to be used for mainstream programming, although some esoteric features, such as visuospatial syntax,McLean, A., Griffiths, D., Collins, N., and Wiggins, G. (2010). \\"Visualisation of Live Code\\". In Electronic Visualisation and the Arts, London: 2010. have inspired practical applications in the arts. Such languages are often popular among hackers and hobbyists. Usability is rarely a goal for esoteric programming language designers‚Äîoften the design leads to quite the opposite. Their usual aim is to remove or replace conventional language features while still maintaining a language that is Turing-complete, or even one for which the computational class is unknown. History The earliest, and still the canonical example of an esoteric language was INTERCAL,Matthew Fuller, Software Studies, MIT Press, 2008 designed in 1972 by Don Woods and James M. Lyon, with the stated intention of being unlike any other programming language the authors were familiar with. It parodied elements of established programming languages of the day, such as Fortran, COBOL, and assembly language. For many years INTERCAL was represented only by paper copies of the INTERCAL manual. The language's revival in 1990 as an implementation in C under Unix stimulated a wave of interest in the intentional design of esoteric computer languages. In 1993, Wouter van Oortmerssen created FALSE, a small stack-oriented programming language, with syntax designed to make the code inherently obfuscated, confusing, and unreadable. It also has a compiler of only 1024 bytes. This inspired Urban M√ºller to create an even smaller language, the now-infamous brainfuck, which consists of only eight recognized characters. Along with Chris Pressey's Befunge (like FALSE, but with a two-dimensional instruction pointer), brainfuck is now one of the best-supported esoteric programming languages. These are canonical examples of minimal Turing tarpits and needlessly obfuscated language features. Brainfuck is related to the P‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ family of Turing machines.  Examples  = Befunge = Befunge allows the instruction pointer to roam in multiple dimensions through the code. For example, the following program displays \\"Hello World\\" by pushing the characters in reverse order onto the stack, then printing the characters in a loop which circulates clockwise through the instructions \`>\`, \`:\`, \`v\`, \`_\`, \`,\`, and \`^\`. \\"dlroW olleH\\">:v ^,_@ = Binary lambda calculus = Binary lambda calculus is designed from an algorithmic information theory perspective to allow for the densest possible code with the most minimal means, featuring a 29 byte self interpreter, a 21 byte prime number sieve, and a 112 byte Brainfuck interpreter. = Brainfuck = Brainfuck is designed for extreme minimalism and leads to obfuscated code, with programs containing only eight distinct characters. The following program outputs \\"Hello World!\\": ++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++ ..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++...>+. = FRACTRAN = A FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive fractions together with an initial positive integer input n. The program is run by multiplying the integer n by the first fraction f in the list for which nf is an integer. The integer n is then replaced by nf and the rule is repeated. If no fraction in the list produces an integer when multiplied by n then the program halts. FRACTRAN was invented by mathematician John Conway. = GolfScript = Programs in GolfScript consist of lists of items, each of which is pushed onto the stack as it is encountered with the exception of variables which have code blocks as their value, in which case the code is executed. = INTERCAL = INTERCAL, short for \\"Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym\\", was created in 1972 as a parody to satirize aspects of the various programming languages at the time. = JSFuck = JSFuck is an esoteric programming style of JavaScript, where code is written using only six characters: \`[\`, \`]\`, \`(\`, \`)\`, \`!\`, and \`+\`. Unlike Brainfuck, which requires its own compiler or interpreter, JSFuck is valid JavaScript code, meaning JSFuck programs can be run in any web browser or engine that interprets JavaScript. = LOLCODE = LOLCODE is designed to resemble the speech of lolcats. The following is the \\"hello World\\" example: HAI CAN HAS STDIO? VISIBLE \\"HAI WORLD!\\" KTHXBYE LOLCODE is frequently criticized for not being very esoteric, but rather being an ordinary procedural language with an unusual vocabulary. = Malbolge = Malbolge (the 8th circle of Hell) was designed to be the most difficult and esoteric programming language. Among other features, code is self-modifying by design and the effect of an instruction depends on its address in memory. = Piet = Piet program that prints 'Piet' A \\"Hello World\\" program in Piet Piet is a language designed by David Morgan-Mar, whose programs are bitmaps that look like abstract art. The compilation is guided by a \\"pointer\\" that moves around the image, from one continuous coloured region to the next. Procedures are carried through when the pointer exits a region. There are 20 colours for which behaviour is specified: 18 \\"colourful\\" colours, which are ordered by a 6-step hue cycle and a 3-step brightness cycle; and black and white which are not ordered. When exiting a \\"colourful\\" colour and entering another one, the performed procedure is determined by the number of steps of change in hue and brightness. Black cannot be entered; when the pointer tries to enter a black region, the rules of choosing the next block are changed instead. If all possible rules are tried, the program terminates. Regions outside the borders of the image are also treated as black. White does not perform operations, but allows the pointer to \\"pass through\\". The behaviour of colours other than the 20 specified is left to the compiler or interpreter. Variables are stored in memory as signed integers in a single stack. Most specified procedures deal with operations on that stack, others with input/output and with the rules by which the compilation pointer moves. Piet was named after the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. The originally intended name, Mondrian, was already taken for an open-source statistical data-visualization system. = Shakespeare = Shakespeare is designed to make programs look like Shakespearean plays. For example, the following statement declares a point in the program which can be reached via a GOTO-type statement: Act I: Hamlet's insults and flattery. = Unlambda = Unlambda is a minimalist functional programming language based on SKI calculus, but combined with first-class continuations and imperative I/O (with input usually requiring the use of continuations). = Whitespace = Whitespace uses only whitespace characters (space, tab, and return), ignoring all other characters, which can therefore be used for comments. This is the reverse of many traditional languages, which do not distinguish between different whitespace characters, treating tab and space the same. It also allows Whitespace programs to be hidden in the source code of programs in languages like C.  Cultural context  The cultural context of esolangs has been studied by Geoff Cox, who writes that esolangs \\"shift attention from command and control toward cultural expression and refusal\\", seeing esolangs as similar to code art and code poetry, such as Mez Breeze's mezangelle. Daniel Temkin describes brainfuck as \\"refusing to ease the boundary between human expression and assembly code and thereby taking us on a ludicrous journey of logic,\\" exposing the inherent conflict between human thinking and computer logic. He connects programming within an esolang to performing an event score such as those of the Fluxus movement, where playing out the rules of the logic in code makes the point of view of the language clear.

In 1984, Raj Ahuja, who had been an associate with the firm for 15 years, was made a full partner. Two years later, they moved into the Lipstick Building at 885 Third Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets, which the firm had designed. That same year, Burgee negotiated a lesser role in the partnership for Johnson, as a design consultant, and in 1988 he asked Ahuja to leave. Completing the transformation of the firm, in 1991 Johnson left altogether, at Burgee's behest.

A number of his buildings, including his private residence, have become world-renowned attractions. His works are cited as being among the most important works of contemporary architecture in the 2010 World Architecture Survey, which led Vanity Fair to label him as \\"the most important architect of our age\\". Gehry's best-known works include the titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles; Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, France; MIT Ray and Maria Stata Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Vontz Center for Molecular Studies on the University of Cincinnati campus; Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle; New World Center in Miami Beach; Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis; Dancing House in Prague; the Vitra Design Museum and the MARTa Herford museum in Germany; the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto; the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in Paris; and 8 Spruce Street in New York City.

His father was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish parents, and his mother was a Polish Jewish immigrant born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫.Finding Your Roots, February 2, 2016, PBSGorin, Abbott (Spring 2015) \\"A Golden Age of Jewish Architects\\" Jewish Currents. Retrieved 12 January 2020. A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan,Ouroussoff, Nicolai (October 25, 1998) \\"I'm Frank Gehry, and This Is How I See the World\\" https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-oct-25-tm-35829-story.html Los Angeles Times Magazine with whom he would build little cities out of scraps of wood. With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor. His use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \\"everyday\\" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He would spend time drawing with his father, while his mother introduced him to the world of art. \\"So the creative genes were there\\", Gehry says. \\"But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\\" He was given the Hebrew name \\"Ephraim\\" by his grandfather, but only used it at his bar mitzvah. =Education= In 1947, his family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. Gehry got a job driving a delivery truck, and studied at Los Angeles City College, eventually to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. According to Gehry, \\"I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\\" Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from the University of Southern California in 1954.Schoenberg, Jeremy (January 18, 2011) \\"Architect Frank Gehry Named Judge Widney Professor\\" USC News After graduating from college, he spent time away from the field of architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army. In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, where he studied city planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He left before completing the program, disheartened and underwhelmed. Gehry's left-wing ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized, and the final straw occurred when he sat in on a discussion of one professor's \\"secret project in progress\\"‚Äîa palace that he was designing for right-wing Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista (1901‚Äì1973).

In 1957 he was given the chance to design his first private residence at the age of 28, with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife's family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California, for his wife Anita's family neighbor Melvin David, \\"The David Cabin\\", shows features that were to become synonymous with later work. The over mountain retreat has unique design features with strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations at the time like Shosoin Treasure House in Nara, Japan, among others. Beams protrude from the exterior sides, vertical grain douglas fir detail, and exposed, unfinished ceiling beams are prominent features. In 1961, he moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet.Goldberger (2015), pp.110-111 Lazo, Caroline Evensen (2006) Frank Gehry. Twenty-First Century Books Hawthorne, Christopher (October 8, 2014) \\"In Paris, a Passion for All Things Frank Gehry\\" Los Angeles Times In 1962, Gehry established a practice in Los Angeles, which became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967 and then Gehry Partners in 2001.Gehry Partners, LLP website Gehry's earliest commissions were all in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, California. Among these works, however, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence. Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, the house features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible. Gehry still resides there. Other completed buildings designed by Gehry during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. In 1989, Gehry was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The jury cited Gehry as \\"Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\\" Though Gehry continued to design other notable buildings in California such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars, he also began to receive larger national and international commissions. These include Gehry's first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany completed in 1989. This was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise (1994) in Paris, and the Dancing House (1996) in Prague. In 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \\"masterpiece of the 20th century\\" and legendary architect Philip Johnson as \\"the greatest building of our time\\", the museum became famous for its striking, yet aesthetically pleasing design and the economic effect that it had on the city. Since then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and has further established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music, such as the boisterous and curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles, which has been the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization and has been labeled by the Los Angeles Times as \\"the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\\", the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago's Millennium Park, and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \\"a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\\" Other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004) at MIT and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University, museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington, commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City, and residential buildings such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011) in New York City. Several recent and ongoing major works by Gehry around the world include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building in the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014. The Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \\"sweeping lines\\" is described as \\"10 out of 10\\" on a scale of difficulty. An ongoing project is the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates. Other significant projects such as the Mirvish Towers in Toronto, and a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the \\"High Street\\" phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there. However, in recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs such as a major Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project and was also dropped in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center, both in New York City. Nevertheless, some stalled projects have recently shown progress: after many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though Gehry's controversial design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC, has been subject to numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, the project was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design. In 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo, a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama, and the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France, which opened to some rave reviews. Also in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA, formerly known as the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation, a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river. In February 2015, the new building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, with a fa√ßade constructed from more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs, and costing AU$180 million. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \\"crumpled paper bag\\" again. Gehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France Fran√ßois Hollande had assured the architect that he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move. Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then had been New York City's tallest residential building. Architectural style Said to \\"defy categorisation\\", Gehry's work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements. With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while still remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \\"made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\\", although his approach may become \\"less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\\". Gehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \\"funk\\" art movement in the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art. His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism. Gehry has been called \\"the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\\".Adams, B. (1988) \\"Frank Gehry's Merzbau\\". Art in America 76: pp.139‚Äì144 However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist, who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting. =Gallery= File:Barcelona Gehry Golden Fish 02.jpg\\"El Peix\\", fish sculpture located in front of the Port Ol√≠mpic, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain (1992) File:Case danzanti.jpgDancing House in Prague (1996) File:Aerial view of EMPSFM.jpgThe Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle (2000) File:Gehry- Tower office building Goethestrasse Reuterstrasse Mitte Hannover Germany.jpgGehry Tower in Hanover, Germany (2001) File:Peter B.

In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated US$160 million were added to the Basque economy. Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened. In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Though some link the concept of the Bilbao Effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect. =Criticism= Though much of Gehry's work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. Art historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding. Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without accounting for the local climate.Speck, Jeff (2012)Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time New York: North Point Press. pp.243-45. Moreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super- wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement, \\"In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit.\\" Other aspects of career =Academia= In January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture. He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. In addition to his position at USC, Gehry has held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, and at Yale University, where he is still teaching as of 2017.\\"Frank O. Gehry\\" Yale School of Architecture website Though Gehry is often referred to as a \\"starchitect\\", he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting instead that he is only an architect. Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that \\"...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate\\". , Gehry has received over a dozen honorary degrees from various universities (see #Honorary doctorates). In February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was then released in July. =Exhibition design= Gehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the \\"Art Treasures of Japan\\" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \\"Assyrian Reliefs\\" show in 1966 and the \\"Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\\" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \\"Treasures of Tutankhamen\\" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \\"Avant-Garde in Russia 1910‚Äì1930\\" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \\"Seventeen Artists in the '60s\\" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \\"German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\\" in 1983. In 1991/92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \\"Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\\", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin.Muchnic, Suzanne (February 6, 1992), \\"LACMA 'Degenerate' Exhibit to Make a Stop in Germany\\" Los Angeles TimesWilson, William (February 15, 1991) \\"Revisiting the Unthinkable: Nazi Germany's 'Degenerate Art' Show at LACMA\\" Los Angeles Times In 2014, Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron.Fleishman, Jeffrey (February 28, 2014) \\"Frank Gehry and Alexander Calder, a captivating union at LACMA\\" Los Angeles Times The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014. In addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \\"The Art of the Motorcycle\\" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas. In 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles. =Stage design= In 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the \\"Temporary Contemporary\\", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop.Lazar, Julie (1983) \\"Interview: Frank Gehry\\" in Available Light Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The pieces was revived in 2015,Lazar, Julie (June 3, 2015) \\"'Available Light' Returns to the Stage After Three Decades\\" KCET and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.\\"Available Light\\" FringeArts In 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. In April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \\"exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\\" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year. =Other designs= Wiggle side chair In addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \\"Easy Edges\\", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \\"Bentwood Furniture\\". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for the enlisted soldiers. In many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \\"It was by accident I got into the fish image\\", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \\"Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\\"Pollack, Sydney (dir.) (1985) American Masters: Sketches of Frank Gehry (TV documentary) PBS. Accessdate=2008-11-17 As a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Ol√≠mpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989‚Äì92) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).\\"Frank Gehry: Fish Lamps, November 7 - December 21, 2013\\" Gagosian Gallery, London Gehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector's chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company. In 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey. He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016. In 2014, Gehry was one of the six \\"iconoclasts\\" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their \\"Celebrating Monogram\\" campaign. In 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht. =Software development= Gehry's firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software. His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Syst√®mes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation.Ferro, Shaunacy (September 11, 2014), Frank Gehry's Software Company Acquired Fast Company. Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid. Personal life Having grown up in Canada, Gehry is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league in his office, FOG (which stands for Frank Owen Gehry), though he no longer plays with them.Goldberger (2015) In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey.Baurick, Tristan (May 13, 2004). \\"Architect's love of the game inspiration behind Cup trophy\\", Ottawa Citizen, p. C2. Gehry is a naturalized U.S. citizen and is also a citizen of Canada.LaRose, Lauren (December 3, 2016) \\"Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry ‚Äòvery worried‚Äô about Donald Trump\\" iPolitics He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles.\\"Gehry Partners, LLP\\" Archinect Gehry is known for his sometimes cantankerous personality. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain, to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a \\"showy\\" architect. Gehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, Foggy. Gehry also serves on the Leadership council of The New York Stem Cell Foundation. In popular culture In 2004, he voiced himself on the children's TV show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse. Gehry also voiced himself in the 2005 episode of The Simpsons called \\"The Seven-Beer Snitch\\", in which he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. Gehry has since voiced that he regrets his appearance since a joke about his design technique has led people to misunderstand his architectural process. In 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry's work called Sketches of Frank Gehry. The film, which followed Gehry over the course of five years and painted a positive portrait of his character, was well-received critically.Sketches of Frank Gehry. Rotten Tomatoes. In 2009, architecturally-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the \\"Frank Behry\\", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies. Works =Exhibitions of Gehry's work= In October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry's work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Other museums or major galleries that have done exhibitions on Gehry's architecture or design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983 and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Subsequently, further museums that have done major exhibitions on Gehry's work include the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in 1992, the Gagosian Gallery in 1984, 1992, and 1993, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2001, the Guggenheim Bilbao in 2002, the Jewish Museum in Manhattan in 2010, and the Milan Triennale, first in 1988 and then in 2010, with an exhibition entitled \\"Frank Gehry from 1997\\". In 2015, LACMA held a major retrospective of Gehry's work. Gehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale's La Strada Novissima installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named Il Corso del Coltello done in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 Venice Biennale. He subsequently contributed to the 2008 Venice Biennale with the installation Ungapatchket. In October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.

His public buildings in the Beaux Arts style reflect the optimistic American sense that the nation was heir to Greek democracy, Roman law and Renaissance humanism. Gilbert's achievements were recognized in his lifetime; he served as president of the American Institute of Architects in 1908‚Äì09. Gilbert was a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order. His design of the new Supreme Court building (1935), with its classical lines and small size, contrasted sharply with the large federal buildings going up along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which he disliked.Geoffrey Blodgett, \\"Cass Gilbert, Architect: Conservative at Bay,\\" Journal of American History, December 1985, Vol. 72 Issue 3, pp. 615‚Äì636 in JSTOR Heilbrun says \\"Gilbert's pioneering buildings injected vitality into skyscraper design, and his 'Gothic skyscraper,' epitomized by the Woolworth Building, profoundly influenced architects during the first decades of the twentieth century.\\"Margaret Heilbrun, Inventing the skyline: the architecture of Cass Gilbert (Columbia U.P. 2000) p xxxv Christen and Flanders note that his reputation among architectural critics went into eclipse during the age of modernism, but has since rebounded because of \\"respect for the integrity and classic beauty of his masterworks\\".Barbara S. Christen and Steven Flanders, eds. Cass Gilbert, Life and Work: Architect of the Public Domain (2001) p 72  Early life  Gilbert was born in Zanesville, Ohio, the middle of three sons, and was named after the statesman Lewis Cass, to whom he was distantly related. Gilbert's father General Samuel A. Gilbert was a Union veteran of the American Civil War and a surveyor for the United States Coast Survey. His uncle was Union Gen. Charles Champion Gilbert. When he was nine, Gilbert's family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he was raised by his mother after his father died. He attended preparatory school but dropped out of Macalester College. He began his architectural career at age 17 by joining the Abraham M. Radcliffe office in St. Paul. In 1878, Gilbert enrolled in the architecture program at MIT.  Minnesota career  Gilbert later worked for a time with the firm of McKim, Mead & White before starting a practice in St. Paul with James Knox Taylor. He was commissioned to design a number of railroad stations, including those in Anoka, Willmar and the still-extant Little Falls depot, all in Minnesota. As a Minnesota architect he was best known for his design of the Minnesota State Capitol and the downtown St. Paul Endicott Building. His goal was to move to New York City and gain a national reputation, but he remained in Minnesota from 1882 until 1898. Many of his Minnesota buildings are still standing, including more than a dozen private residences (especially those on St. Paul's Summit Avenue), several churches featuring rich textures and colors, resort summer homes, and warehouses.Irish, Sharon. \\"West Hails East: Cass Gilbert in Minnesota\\" Minnesota History, April 1993, Vol. 53 Issue 5, pp 196‚Äì207 National reputation The completion of the Minnesota capitol gave Gilbert his national reputation and in 1898 he permanently moved his base to New York. His breakthrough commission was the design of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in New York City, which now houses the George Gustav Heye Center. Gilbert served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1910 to 1916.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 545. In 1906 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1908. Gilbert served as President of the Academy from 1926 to 1933. Gilbert's Woolworth Building in New York City was the world's tallest building when it was built in 1913  Historical impact  Gilbert was a skyscraper pioneer; when designing the Woolworth Building he moved into unproven ground ‚Äî though he certainly was aware of the ground-breaking work done by Chicago architects on skyscrapers and once discussed merging firms with the legendary Daniel Burnham ‚Äî and his technique of cladding a steel frame became the model for decades. Modernists embraced his work: John Marin painted it several times; even Frank Lloyd Wright praised the lines of the building, though he decried the ornamentation. Gilbert was one of the first celebrity architects in America, designing skyscrapers in New York City and Cincinnati, campus buildings at Oberlin College and the University of Texas at Austin, state capitols in Minnesota and West Virginia, the support towers of the George Washington Bridge, railroad stations (including the New Haven Union Station, 1920), and the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.. His reputation declined among some professionals during the age of Modernism, but he was on the design committee that guided and eventually approved the modernist design of Manhattan's groundbreaking Rockefeller Center. Gilbert's body of work as a whole is more eclectic than many critics admit. In particular, his Union Station in New Haven lacks the embellishments common of the Beaux-Arts period and contains the simple lines common in Modernism. Gilbert wrote to a colleague, \\"I sometimes wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you and I both know that whatever it may be in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only a skyscraper.\\"Letter to Ralph Adams Cram, 1920 quoted in Goldberger, Paul (2001) Cass Gilbert, \\"Remembering the turn-of-the-century urban visionary\\", Architectural Digest, February issue, pp. 106‚Äì102 Gilbert's two buildings on the University of Texas at Austin campus, Sutton Hall (1918) and Battle Hall (1911), are recognized by architectural historians as among the finest works of architecture in the state. Designed in a Spanish- Mediterranean revival style, the two buildings became the stylistic basis for the later expansion of the university in the 1920s and 1930s and helped popularize the style throughout Texas.  Archives  Gilbert's drawings and correspondence are preserved at the New-York Historical Society, the Minnesota Historical Society, the University of Minnesota, and the Library of Congress.  Notable works  Battle Hall, University of Texas at Austin The Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College alt=A three-story stone building, seen from its left, with two projecting wings and a balustrade running along the top. An American flag flies from a flagpole above the main entrance at the center, where a row of four columns marks the main entrance. There is an iron fence in front and small iron balconies on the wings. * Saint Paul Seminary, Saint Paul, Minnesota.  Cretin Hall, Loras Hall, a gymnasium (now the Service Center), a classroom building, the refectory building, and the administration building in 1894 were commissioned by James J. Hill. Only Cretin, Loras, and the Service Center still stand. * Minnesota State Capitol, Saint Paul, Minnesota, 1895‚Äì1905.  Designed in High Renaissance style, the building is not a replica of the United States Capitol. Local newspapers made a fuss when Gilbert sent to Georgia for marble, but the result, in which a hemispherical dome caps a high drum not unlike that of St. Peter's Basilica, crowning a building housing the bicameral legislature and the state supreme court, was so nobly handsome that West Virginia and Arkansas contracted for Gilbert capitols as well. Its brick dome is held in hoops of steel. * St. Clement's Episcopal Church, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1895.  Designed in the traditional English country church style, with a lychgate and close, bell tower, and parish hall (renovated in 2006). Funded by a generous donation from Mrs. Theodore Eaton, widow of the rector of St. Clement's Episcopal Church in New York City. Includes original furniture, baptismal font, encaustic tile floor in choir, elaborate rood screen, linen-fold paneling, and parquet oak floor in sanctuary. The altar features Tiffany Studios stained glass window depicting the empty cross. * Northern Pacific Railway Depot, 701 Main Street, Fargo, North Dakota, 1898. * The Broadway-Chambers Building (277 Broadway), Manhattan, 1899‚Äì1900.  Gilbert's first building in New York City. * Essex County Courthouse, Newark, 1904 * Saint Louis Art Museum (Palace of the Fine Arts), St. Louis, Missouri, 1904.  Built for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and the only major building of the fair built as a permanent structure. * Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, Manhattan, 1902‚Äì1907.  Facing Bowling Green park in Lower Manhattan * 90 West Street, Manhattan, 1905‚Äì1907.  Severely damaged during the September 11, 2001 attacks, this building in lower Manhattan has since been completely restored. * Designs for 12 local stations on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in the Bronx and Westchester County, New York, 1908. Not all were built, and only four were extant in 2014, all in the Bronx: the Westchester Avenue station and Bartow station are in ruins, and the Morris Park and Hunts Point stations have been converted to other uses. All ceased to be used as railroad stations by the late 1930s. * Metals Bank Building, Butte, Montana, 1906.  Commissioned by F. Augustus Heinze, this eight-story low-rise building has an internal steel frame. It was the second to be built in Butte after the 1901 Hirbour Building, which also has eight stories. * A series of master plans for the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota, 1907. * Spalding Building, Portland, Oregon, 1911.

Ives Memorial Library  At the corner of Elm and Temple Streets in downtown New Haven, architect Gilbert designed the brick and marble building to harmonize with the traditional architecture of New Haven, and especially with the United Church nearby. The building was formally dedicated to the City of New Haven on May 27, 1911. Kelsey Building * Kelsey Building, Trenton, New Jersey, 1911.  Built by Henry Cooper Kelsey as a memorial to his wife. Now used by Thomas Edison State University. * St. Louis Public Library, St. Louis, Missouri, 1912  The main library for the city's public library system, in a severe classicizing style, has an oval central pavilion surrounded by four light courts. The outer facades of the free- standing building are of lightly rusticated Maine granite. The Olive Street front is disposed like a colossal arcade, with contrasting marble bas-relief panels. A projecting three-bay central block, like a pared-down triumphal arch, provides a monumental entrance. At the rear the Central Library faced a sunken garden. The interiors feature some light-transmitting glass floors. The ceiling of the Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelo's ceiling in the Laurentian Library. * Woolworth Building, Manhattan, New York, 1913.  A Gothic Revival skyscraper clad in glazed terracotta panels, it was the tallest building in the world when built. Bas-reliefs in the lobby depict Woolworth and Gilbert with Woolworth holding nickels and dimes. * PNC Tower, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1913.  Originally built as the headquarters for the Union Central Life Insurance Company. * Austin, Nichols and Company Warehouse, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, 1915. * Fountain, Ridgefield, Connecticut, 1914‚Äì16.  This fountain, at the intersection of Routes 35 and 33, was designed and donated to the town by Cass Gilbert, who had a home within sight of the intersection. In 2004, a drunk driver crashed into the fountain, heavily damaging it; the fountain was rebuilt, raised higher, and surrounded by protective plantings, and it is still functioning today.The Ridgefield Press, various issues. * Four buildings at Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio  Gilbert designed four buildings at Oberlin: Finney Chapel (1909), the Cox Administration Building (1915), the Allen Memorial Art Museum, and Bosworth Hall (1931). He enjoyed a close working relationship with Oberlin's president Henry Churchill King, but his relationship with Oberlin deteriorated after King retired in 1927 and most of the design work and construction supervision of Bosworth Hall and its residential quadrangle was done by Gilbert's son Cass Jr., who had earlier supervised the construction of the Allen Memorial Hospital (1924) in Oberlin (now Mercy Allen Medical Center). * Chase Headquarters Building, Waterbury, Connecticut, 1917-1919.  This building was designed as the headquarters of the Chase Company and forms part of the Waterbury Municipal Center Complex, a unique concentration of Gilbert's architecture comprising the Waterbury City Hall, the Chase Bank Building and the Chase company headquarters, Chase's house, a dispensary and Lincoln House, a headquarters building for the city's charities. * G.

Gilbert's last major project, guided to completion by his son, Cass Gilbert Jr. He died a year before it was completed. A vast Roman temple in the Corinthian order is penetrated by a cross range articulated with pilasters in very low relief. The central tablet in the richly sculpted frieze reads EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. His design for the U.S. Supreme Court chambers was based upon his design for the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals at the state capitol in Charleston.

Cass Gilbert designed the famous Woolworth Building skyscraper on Broadway for Frank W. Woolworth, while Woolworth's personal mansion was designed by C. P. H. Gilbert. The Ukrainian Institute building on Manhattan's 5th Avenue is the work of C. P. H. Gilbert, and often incorrectly attributed to Cass Gilbert. Cass Gilbert is sometimes also confused with his son, architect Cass Gilbert, Jr.  References  Notes Further reading * Christen, Barbara S. and Flanders, Steven (editors).

As well as principal of Michael Graves and Associates and Michael Graves Design Group, he was of a member of The New York Five and the Memphis Group - and professor of architecture at Princeton University for nearly forty years. Following his own partial paralysis in 2003, Graves became an internationally recognized advocate of health care design. Graves' global portfolio of architectural work ranged from the Ministry of Culture in The Hague, a post office for Celebration, Florida, a prominent expansion of the Denver Public Library to numerous commissions for Disney - as well as the scaffolding design for the 2000 Washington Monument restoration. He was recognized as a major influence on architectural movements including New Urbanism, New Classicism and particularly Postmodernism  his buildings in the latter style including the noted Portland Building in Oregon and the Humana Building in Kentucky. For his architectural work, Graves received a fellowship of the American Institute of Architects as well as its highest award, the AIA Gold Medal (2001). He was trustee of the American Academy in Rome and was the president of its Society of Fellows from 1980 to 1984. He received the American Prize for Architecture, the National Medal of Arts (1999) and the Driehaus Architecture Prize (2012). Nonetheless, Graves became popularly well known through his high end as well as mass consumer product designs for companies ranging from Alessi in Italy - to Target and J. C. Penney in the United States. The New York Times described Graves as \\"one of the most prominent and prolific American architects of the latter 20th century, who designed more than 350 buildings around the world but was perhaps best known for [a] teakettle and pepper mill.\\" Personal life and education Graves was born on July 9, 1934, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Erma (Lowe) and Thomas B. Graves. He grew up in the city's suburbs and later credited his mother for suggestion that he become and engineer or an architect. See also: Graves graduated from Indianapolis's Broad Ripple High School in 1952 and earned a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1958 from the University of Cincinnati.Iovine, p. 94. During college he also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Graves earned a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University in 1959. After graduation from college, Graves spent a year working in George Nelson's office. Nelson, a furniture designer and the creative director for Herman Miller, exposed Graves to the work of fellow designers Charles and Ray Eames and Alexander Girard. In 1960 Graves won the American Academy in Rome's Prix de Rome (Rome Prize) and spent the next two years at the Academy in Italy.Iovine, Michael Graves, p. 15; Graves describes himself as \\"transformed\\" by his experience in Rome: \\"I discovered new ways of seeing and analyzing both architecture and landscape.\\"\\"Introduction\\" in Little is known of Graves' married life. His marriage to Gail Devine in 1955 ended in divorce; his subsequent marriage to Lucy James in 1972 also ended in divorce.Israel, p. 69; Graves was the father of three children, two sons and a daughter. Career The Portland Building in Oregon, 1982 Graves began his career in 1962 as a professor of architecture at Princeton University, where he taught for nearly four decades, and established his own architectural firm in 1964 at Princeton, New Jersey. Graves worked as an architect in public practice designing a variety of buildings that included private residences, university buildings, hotel resorts, hospitals, retail and commercial office buildings, museums, civic buildings, and monuments. During a career that spanned nearly fifty years, Graves and his firm designed more than 350 buildings around the world, in addition to an estimated 2,000 household products. =Professor of Architecture= In 1962, after two years of studies in Rome, Graves returned to the United States and moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where he had accepted a professorship at the Princeton University School of Architecture. Graves taught at Princeton for thirty-nine years while simultaneously practicing architecture. He retired as the Robert Schirmer Professor of Architecture, Emeritus, in 2001. Although Graves was a longtime faculty member at Princeton and trained many of its architecture students, the university did not allow its faculty to practice their profession on its campus. As a result, Graves was never commissioned to design a building for the university.Israel, p. 126. =Architect= In his early years as an architect, Graves did designs for home renovation projects in Princeton. In 1964 he founded the architectural firm of Michael Graves & Associate in Princeton and remained in public practice there until the end of his life. His firm maintained offices in Princeton, New Jersey, and in New York City, but his residence in Princeton served as his design studio, home office and library, and a place to display the many objects he collected during his world travels. Nicknamed \\"The Warehouse\\", it also displayed many of the household items he designed.Built in the 1920s by Italian masons who came to work on buildings at Princeton University, the warehouse originally stored furniture. Graves bought the dilapidated building in 1970 for $30,000. He remodeled and expanded the L-shaped structure into a Tuscan-style villa. Graves later added a terracotta-colored surface to its exterior later. See Iovine, p. 18, and After Graves's death, Kean University acquired his former home and studio in Princeton, along with two adjacent buildings. Also: Modernist Graves spent much of the late 1960s and early 1970s designing modern residences. Notable examples include the Hanselman House (1967) and the Snyderman House (1972, destroyed by fire in 2002) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Graves also became one of the New York Five, along with Peter Eisenman, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier. This informal group of Princeton and New York City architects, also known as the Whites due to the predominant color of their architectural work, espoused a pure form of modernism that is characterized by clean lines and minimal ornamentation. The New York Five became the \\"standard- bearers of a movement to elevate modernist architectural form into a serious theoretical pursuit.\\" Five Architects (1973) describes some of their early work. Postmodernist In the late 1970s, Graves shifted away from modernism to pursue Postmodernism and New Urbanism design for the remainder of his career. He began by sketching designs that had Cubist-inspired elements and strong, saturated colors. Postmodernism allowed Graves to introduce his humanist vision of classicism, as well as his sense of irony and humor. His designs, notable for their \\"playful style\\" and \\"colorful facades,\\" were a \\"radical departure\\" from his earlier work.Israel, p. 21. The Plocek Residence (1977), a private home in Warren Township, New Jersey, was among the first of his designs in this new style. Graves designed some of his most iconic buildings in the early 1980s, including the Portland Building. The fifteen- story Portland Municipal Services Building, his first major public commission, opened in 1982 in downtown Portland, Oregon. The \\"monolithic cube\\" with decorated facades and colorful, oversized columns is \\"considered a seminal Postmodern work\\" and one of Graves's best-known works of architecture. The celebrated but controversial municipal office also became an icon for the city of Portland and subject to an ongoing preservation debate. Regarded as the first major built example of postmodern architecture in a tall office building, the Portland Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Although it faced demolition in 2014, the city government decided to proceed with a renovation, estimated to cost $195 million. Humana Building in Louisville, Kentucky, 1982 As a result of the notoriety he received from the Portland Building design, Graves was awarded other major commissions in the 1980s and 1990s. Notable buildings from this period include the Humana Building (1982) in Kentucky and the Newark Museum expansion (1982) in New Jersey.Israel, p. 128; Iovine, p. 11. Some architecture critics, including Paul Goldberger of The New York Times, consider the Humana Building, a skyscraper in Louisville, Kentucky, one of Graves's finest building designs. TIME magazine also claimed it was a commercial icon for the city of Louisville and one of the best buildings of the 1980s. The San Juan Capistrano Library (1982) in California, another project from this period, shows his interpretation of the Mission Revival style. Graves and his firm also designed several buildings for the Walt Disney Company in the postmodern style. These include the Team Disney headquarters in Burbank, California; the Dolphin (1987) and Swan (1988) resorts at Walt Disney World in Florida; and Disney's Hotel New York (1989) at Disneyland Paris. Patrick Burke, the project architect for the two resort hotels in Florida, commented that the Walt Disney Company described Graves's designs as \\"entertainment architecture.\\" In addition to the Swan and Dolphin hotel buildings, Graves's firm designed their original interiors, furnishings, signage, and artwork.Iovine, pp. 12‚Äì13. Graves's other notable commissions for buildings that were completed in the 1990s include an expansion of the Denver Public Library (1990) and the renovation of the Detroit Institute of Arts (1990). Postmodern architecture did not have a long-lasting popularity and some of Graves's clients rejected his ideas. For example, his design for an expansion of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in the mid-1980s was highly contested and never built due to local opposition. Graves's designs for a planned Phoenix Municipal Government Center complex were among the project's finalists, but his concept was not selected as the winning entry. NCAA Hall of Champions in Indianapolis, Indiana, 1997 Graves's prominence as a postmodernist architect may have reached its peak during the 1980s and in the early 1990s, but he continued to practice as an architect until his death in 2015. Later works include the O'Reilly Theater (1996) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the NCAA Hall of Champions in Indianapolis, Indiana; and 425 Fifth Avenue (2000) in New York City, among others. Graves also received recognition for his multi-year renovation of his personal residence in Princeton. International projects included the Sheraton Miramar Hotel (1997) in El Gouna, Egypt, and the Hard Rock Hotel in Singapore. One of the last projects that Michael Graves and Associates was involved in before Graves's death was the Louwman Museum (2010) in The Hague, Netherlands. Gary Lapera, a principal and studio head of Michael Graves and Associates, designed the museum, also known as the Lowman Collection and the National Automobile Museum of the Netherlands, which houses more than 230 cars. =Product and furniture designer= In addition to his architecture, Graves became a noted designer of consumer products. His distinctive style was well known among the general public in the United States in 1980s and 1990s, when he began designing household products for major clients such as the Target Corporation, Alessi, Steuben, and The Walt Disney Company. Over the years, the Michael Graves Design Group, a part of his design firm, designed and brought to market more than 2,000 products.Iovine, p. 94‚Äì95. In the early 1980s Ettore Sottsass recruited Graves to become a member of Memphis, a postmodern design group based in Milan, Italy. Graves began designing consumer products such as furniture and home accessories. Especially notable is his \\"Plaza\\" dressing table. Around the same time, Graves became associated with Alessi, a high-end Italian kitchenware manufacturer. Graves designed a sterling silver tea service for Alessi in 1982, a turning point in his career, and he was no longer known solely as an architect. After the $25,000 tea service began to attract buyers, Alberto Alessi commissioned Graves to design a moderate-priced kettle for his company. In 1985 Graves designed his iconic a stainless-steel teakettle (9093 stovetop kettle).Iovine, pp. 14‚Äì16. Alessi 9093 Teakettle, 1985 The kettle featured a red, bird-shaped whistle at the end of the spout. It remained the company's top-selling product for fifteen years. In honor of its thirtieth anniversary in 2015, Graves designed a special edition version with a dragon replacing the kettle's bird- shaped whistle. Also: In Italy in 1987, clock on display Apollodoro Gallery, seventh event The Hour of Architects, with Hans Hollei, Arata Isozaki, Ettore Sottsass, Paolo Portoghesi, paintings by Paolo Salvati, Rome. In 1997‚Äì98, when Graves designed the scaffolding used in the restoration of the Washington Monument in Washington D.C., he met Ron Johnson, a Target executive who appreciated his product designs. (The Target Corporation contributed $6 million toward restoration of the monument.) The result of their acquaintance was the formation of a business relationship between Graves and the U.S. retailer that lasted until 2012. Graves began the collaboration with Target by designing a half-dozen products for the mass-consumer market. His collection of housewares began selling in Target stores in January 1999.Iovine, p. 21. Also: Cedar Gables House (1998) was commissioned by Target Corp as a model home to showcase his new line of housewares. In 1998 Target commissioned Graves to design a model home to showcase the new line of housewares, but Graves went a step further. He designed \\"Cedar Gables,\\" contemporary house in Minnetonka, Minnesota, complete with custom furniture, lighting, fixtures, and other unique items, making it only one of three homes he designed and furnished. By 2009, however, Graves noted that the house \\"doesn't have a wow factor. That gets old quickly.\\" When the partnership with Target ended in 2012, Graves had designed more than 500 objects for the retailer.Iovine, p. 21. Increasingly concerned about Target's dwindling partnerships with outside designers, Graves decided to explore other relationships for marketing his consumer products. After Johnson became CEO of J.C. Penney in 2011, he and Graves reached an agreement for Graves to design products exclusively for Penney's. Graves also created products for other manufacturers. In the 1990s for example, Graves created the Mickey Mouse Gourmet Collection for Moeller Design with the Walt Disney Company's approval. The collection of kitchenware and tabletop items was initially sold through the Walt Disney Company's retail stores and later offered at other retail outlets. In addition to housewares, Graves was involved in a variety of other design projects that included sets and costumes for New York City's Joffrey Ballet; a shopping bag for Bloomingdale's department store; jewelry for Cleto Munari of Milan, Italy; vinyl flooring for Tajima, a Japanese company; and rugs for Vorwerk, a German firm. In 1994 Graves opened a small retail store named the Graves Design Store in Princeton, New Jersey, where shoppers could purchase his designs and reproductions of his artwork. At that time Graves had designed products for more than fifty manufacturers.Iovine, pp. 16, 20. Later years Graves retired as a professor of architecture at Princeton University in 2001, but remained active in his architecture and design firm. He also became an advocate for the disabled in the last decade of his life. When Graves became paralyzed from the waist down in 2003, the result of a spinal cord infection, the use of a wheelchair heightened his awareness of the needs of the disabled. After weeks of hospitalization and physical therapy, Graves adapted his home to suit his accessibility needs and resumed his architectural and design work. See also: Healthcare Design December 2010; 10 (12):26‚Äì29. In addition to other types of buildings and household products, Graves designed wheelchairs, hospital furnishings, hospitals, and disabled veteran's housing. Graves also became a \\"reluctant health expert\\", as well as an internationally recognized advocate for accessible design. In 2013 President Barack Obama appointed Graves to an administrative role in the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also known as the Access Board). The independent agency addresses accessibility concerns for people with disabilities. In 2014, a year before his death, Graves helped to establish and plan the Michael Graves School of Architecture at Kean University in Union, New Jersey. Kean University's Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies program began in 2015; its Master of Architecture program is slated to begin in 2019. As part of gift from Graves's estate, in 2016 the university acquired \\"The Warehouse\\" at 44 Patton Avenue in Princeton  Graves's former home and studio  as well as two adjacent buildings. The university plans to use the facility as an educational research center for its School of Public Architecture, although its main campus and its School of Public Architecture are located about forty miles away in Union, New Jersey. Death and legacy Graves died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 12, 2015 at the age of 80, and is buried at Princeton Cemetery. Graves favored a \\"humanistic approach to architecture and urban planning\\" and was a major influence in late-twentieth-century architecture.Israel, p. 11. Graves was among the most prolific and prominent American architects from the mid-1960s to the end of the twentieth century. Graves and his team designed more than 350 buildings in the Postmodern, New Classical, and New Urbanism styles for projects around the world. His architectural designs have been recognized as major influences in all three of these movements. In naming Graves as a recipient of its national design award for lifetime achievement, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum explained that Graves broadened \\"the role of the architect in society\\" and raised \\"public interest in good design as essential to the quality of everyday life.\\" Graves and his firm designed more than 2,000 consumer products during his lifetime. He was especially noted for his domestic housewares. Many Graves-designed products were sold through mass-market U.S. retailers such as Target and J. C. Penney, but his best-known product is the iconic kettle that he designed in 1985 for Alessi, an Italian housewares manufacturer. As an advocate for the needs of the disabled, Graves used his skills as an architect and designer \\"to improve healthcare experience for patients, families and clinicians.\\" Awards and honors * In 1979 Graves was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. * Graves served as a trustee of the American Academy in Rome and was the president of its Society of Fellows from 1980 to 1984. * In 1994 he was awarded the American Prize for Architecture * President Bill Clinton awarded Graves the National Medal of Arts in 1999. * Graves was voted GQ's Man of the Year in 1999.Iovine, p. 7. * Graves was awarded the American Institute of Architects' AIA Gold Medal in 2001.

He is noted for designing Canberra, Australia's capital city and Griffith, New South Wales. He has been credited with the development of the L-shaped floor plan, the carport and an innovative use of reinforced concrete. Influenced by the Chicago-based Prairie School, Griffin developed a unique modern style. He worked in partnership with his wife Marion Mahony Griffin. In 28 years they designed over 350 buildings, landscape and urban-design projects as well as designing construction materials, interiors, furniture and other household items. Early life Griffin was born in 1876 in Maywood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He was the eldest of the four children of George Walter Griffin, an insurance agent, and Estelle Burley Griffin. His family moved to Oak Park and later to Elmhurst. As a boy he had an interest in landscape design and gardening, and his parents allowed him to landscape the yard at their new home in Elmhurst. Griffin went to Oak Park High School. He considered studying landscape design but was advised by the landscape gardener O. C. Simonds to pursue a more lucrative profession. Griffin chose to study architecture, and, in 1899, completed his bachelor's degree in architecture at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. The University of Illinois program was run by Nathan Clifford Ricker, a German-educated architect, who emphasized the technical aspects of architecture. During his studies, he also took courses in horticulture and forestry. Chicago career After his studies, Griffin moved to Chicago and was employed as a draftsman for two years in the offices of progressive architects Dwight H. Perkins, Robert C. Spencer, Jr., and H. Webster Tomlinson in \\"Steinway Hall\\". Griffin's employers worked in the distinctive Prairie School style. This style is marked by horizontal lines, flat roofs with broad overhanging eaves, solid construction, craftsmanship, and strict discipline in the use of ornament. Louis Sullivan was influential among Prairie School architects and Griffin was an admirer of his work, and of his philosophy of architecture which stressed that design should be free of historical precedent. Other architects of that school include George Grant Elmslie, George Washington Maher, William Gray Purcell, William Drummond and most importantly, Frank Lloyd Wright. In July 1901, Griffin passed the new Illinois architects' licensing examination and this permitted him to enter private practice as an architect. He began to work in Frank Lloyd Wright's famous Oak Park, Illinois, studios. Although he was never made a partner, Griffin oversaw the construction on many of Wright's noted houses including the Willits House in 1902 and the Larkin Administration Building built in 1904. From 1905 he also began to supply landscape plans for Wright's buildings. Wright allowed Griffin and his other staff to undertake small commissions of their own. The William Emery house, built in Elmhurst, Illinois, in 1903 was such a commission. While working for Wright, Griffin fell in love with Mr. Wright's sister, Maginel Wright. He proposed marriage to her, but his affections for her were not returned, and she refused. In 1906 he resigned his position at Wright's studio and established his own practice at Steinway Hall. Griffin and Wright had fallen out over events following Mr. Wright's trip to Japan in 1905. While Wright was away for five months, Griffin ran the practice. When Wright returned, he told Griffin that he had overstepped his responsibilities, completing several of Wright's jobs, and sometimes substituting his own building designs. Further, Wright had borrowed money from Griffin to pay for his travels abroad, and then he tried to pay off his debts to Griffin with prints he had acquired in Japan. It became clear to Griffin then that Wright would not make Griffin a partner in his business. Griffin's first independent commission was a landscape design for the State Normal School at Charleston, Illinois, now known as the Eastern Illinois University. In the fall of 1906, he received his first residential job from Harry Peters. The Peters' House was the first house designed with an L-shaped or open floor plan. The L-shape was an economical design and easily constructed. From 1907 to 1914 several houses designed by Griffin were built on the far southwest side of Chicago in the city's Beverly and Morgan Park, Chicago neighborhoods. In 1981, the city of Chicago granted landmark status to 13 of these Prairie-style bungalows in Beverly along the 1700 block of West 104th Place, 12 blocks of Longwood Drive between West 98th and 110th Streets, and three blocks of Seeley Avenue. With seven of these houses being located on West 104th Place  comprising the largest concentration of original prairie style homes built in Chicago  the street as it runs between Hale Avenue on the west to Prospect Avenue on the east was designated the Griffin Place Historic District, which comprises a part of the larger Ridge Historic District. In 1911 Griffin developed 'Solid Rock' house for William F. Tempel in Winnetka, Illinois. It was the first house built by Griffin in his mature style and of reinforced concrete. Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin at Castlecrag, Sydney on July 27, 1930 On June 29, 1911 Griffin married Marion Lucy Mahony, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in architecture. She was employed first in Wright's office, and then by Hermann V. von Holst, who had taken over Wright's work in America when Wright left for Europe in 1909. Marion Mahony recommended to von Holst that he hire Griffin to develop a landscape plan for the area surrounding the three houses on Milliken Place for which Wright had been hired in Decatur, Illinois. Mahony and Griffin worked closely on the Decatur project immediately before their marriage. After their marriage, Mahony went to work in Griffin's practice. A housing development with several homes designed by Griffin and Mahony, Rock Crest ‚Äì Rock Glen in Mason City, Iowa, is seen as their most dramatic American design development of the decade and remains the largest collection of Prairie Style homes surrounding a natural setting.Walter Burley Griffin ‚Äì Mason City at www.pbs.org From 1899 to 1914, Griffin created more than 130 designs in his Chicago office for buildings, urban plans and landscapes; half of these were built in the mid- western states of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. The relationship between Griffin and Frank Lloyd Wright cooled in the years following Griffin's departure from Wright's firm in 1906. With Walter and Marion's wedding, Wright started to feel they were \\"against him\\". After the Griffins' win in the Australian federal capital design competition, and resultant front page coverage in the New York Times, Wright and Griffin never spoke to each other again. In later years, whenever Griffin was brought up in conversation Wright would downplay his achievements and refer to him as a draftsman.Paul kruty at www.pbs.org File:William H.

In April 1911 the Australian Commonwealth Government held an international competition to produce a design for its new, as yet unnamed, federal capital city. Griffin produced a design with impressive renderings of the plan by his new wife. They first heard about the competition in July, while on honeymoon, and worked feverishly to prepare the plans. On May 23, 1912, Griffin's design was selected as the winner from among 137 entries. This created significant press coverage at the time and brought him professional and public recognition. Of his plan, he famously remarked: > I have planned a city that is not like any other in the world. I have > planned it not in a way that I expected any government authorities in the > world would accept. I have planned an ideal city ‚Äì a city that meets my > ideal of the city of the future. In 1913, Griffin was invited by the Commonwealth Government to Australia to inspect the site, now named Canberra. He left Mahony Griffin in charge of the practice and travelled to Australia in July. His letters reveal his appreciation for the Australian landscape. The Griffins joined the Naturalists' Society of New South Wales in 1914, where they enjoyed organised bush walks and field studies. The society facilitated their contact with the Australian scientific community, especially botanists. This appreciation for Australian flora was reflected in Griffin's 1914 town plan for the small town of Leeton in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of New South Wales, and later in a design for Newman College at the University of Melbourne.Vernon, C., (2002), 'Griffin, Walter Burley', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, pp. 275‚Äì76. He also utilised Australian flora botanical names as places names for suburbs and streets in Canberra, such as Grevillea Park, Telopea Park, Clienthus Circle and Blandfordia.Vernon, C., (1997), 'Griffin and Australian flora', Australian Garden History, 8 (5), pp. 10‚Äì11. Griffin was offered the position of head of the department of architecture at the University of Illinois. At the same time he was negotiating a three-year contract with the Commonwealth Government to remain in Australia and oversee the implementation of his plan, which he felt had already been compromised. In October 1913 he was appointed the Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction. In this role, Griffin oversaw the design of North and South Canberra, though he struggled with considerable political and bureaucratic obstacles. In May 1914, he and his wife left America for Australia along with architects Roy Lippincott and George Elgh. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Griffin was under pressure to reduce the scope and scale of his plans due to the government diverting funds towards the war effort. Several parts of his basic design underwent change. Plans to create Westbourne, Southbourne and Eastbourne Avenues to complement Canberra's Northbourne Avenue were eliminated, as did a proposed railway connecting South Canberra to North Canberra, and on to Yass, 35 mi (55 km) away. A market area that would have been at Russell Hill in North Canberra was moved south to what is now Fyshwick, next to South Canberra. The pace of building was slower than expected, partly because of a lack of funds and partly because of continued disputation between Griffin and Commonwealth Government bureaucrats. Many of Griffin's design ideas were attacked by both the architectural profession and the press. In 1917 a Royal Commission determined that they had undermined Griffin's authority by supplying him with false data which he had used to carry out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra design project in December 1920 when he discovered that several of these bureaucrats had been appointed to an agency that would oversee Canberra's construction. The Commonwealth Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Hughes had removed Griffin as Director of Design and Construction after disagreements over his supervisory role, and in 1921 it created the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, with John Sulman as chair. Griffin was offered membership, but declined and withdrew from further activity in Canberra.An Ideal City ‚Äì Timeline at www.idealcity.org.au Griffin designed several buildings for Canberra, none of which was built. The grave of General Bridges on Mount Pleasant was the only permanent structure designed by him to be built in Canberra. Aside from the city's design, Griffin's longest- living legacy is the plantation of Redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum), now known as Pialligo Redwood Forest, that he and arborist Thomas Charles Weston planted in 1918. It is on Pialligo Avenue between Canberra and Queanbeyan, 1.8 mi (2.8 km) east of Canberra airport. Later career The Knitlock construction system designed by Griffin. The Griffins' office in Chicago closed in 1917; however, they had successful practices in Melbourne and Sydney, which were a strong motivation for their continuing to live in Australia. The Griffins had received commissions for work outside Canberra since Walter first arrived in the country in 1913, designing town plans, subdivisions, and one of his highly regarded buildings, Newman College, the Catholic residential college of the University of Melbourne while employed in Canberra. While supervising activities in Canberra, Griffin spent much time in Melbourne and, in 1918, became a founder, with Royden Powell, of the Henry George Club, an organisation devoted to providing a home for the Single Tax movement.Henry George Club ‚Äì Home Page at www.hgclub.com.au The Griffins' first major commission after leaving Canberra was the Capitol Theatre in Melbourne; it opened on November 7, 1924. In 1964 architectural writer Robin Boyd described the Capitol as \\"the best cinema that was ever built or is ever likely to be built\\". In 1916 and 1917 Griffin developed a patented modular concrete construction system known as \\"Knitlock\\" for use in the construction of Canberra. No Knitlock buildings were ever built in Canberra, although several were built in Australia. The first were built on Griffin's property in Frankston in 1922, where he constructed two holiday houses called \\"Gumnuts\\". The best examples of Knitlock include the S.R. Salter House in Toorak and the Paling House. Frank Lloyd Wright designed a similar system and used Griffin's design to support the arguments for his design. Mannix Wing walkway at Newman College, University of Melbourne In 1919 the Griffins founded the Greater Sydney Development Association (GSDA), and in 1921 purchased 259 ha of land in North Sydney. The GSDA's goal was the development of an idyllic community with a consistent architectural feel and bushland setting. Walter Burley Griffin as managing director of the GSDA designed all the buildings built in the area until 1935. Castlecrag was the first suburb to be developed by the GSDA. The Redding House and several others in Castelcrag were also built in Knitlock. Almost all the houses Griffin designed in Castlecrag were small and had flat roofs, and he included an internal courtyard in many of them. Griffin used what was at that time the novel concept of including native bushland in these designs. He came to be referred to as \\"The Wizard of Castlecrag\\". Other work the Griffins did during this time included the Melbourne subdivisions of Glenard (where the Griffins built their own Knitlock house \\"Pholiota\\") and Mount Eagle at Eaglemont, and the Ranelagh Estate in Mount Eliza Victoria 1924. The Ranelagh Estate was listed on the Victorian State Heritage Register (H01605) in 2005 as a significant example of a country estate. Prior to 1920 the Griffins also designed the New South Wales towns of Leeton and Griffith. Griffin and architect J Burcham Clamp designed a large tomb built at Waverley Cemetery, Sydney, between 1914 and 1916 for James Stuart, which still stands as a good example of Griffin's sense of 'human-scale monumentality'.\\"Tomb by Burley Griffin sheds darkness and light\\", Sydney Morning Herald, July 21, 1998 The Griffins participated in the celebrated Chicago Tribune Tower Competition in 1922. Having won one famous international competition, as architects who were both well acquainted with Chicago and recognized as practical visionaries, they offered a solution that was positive, forward-looking and elegant. Indeed, their entry appears to have been about a decade ahead of its time, with emphatic verticality along the lines of the Art Deco or Art Moderne. It anticipated, and would have been a near neighbor of, Chicago's 333 North Michigan by Holabird & Roche (1928); with stylistic echos in John and Donald Parkinson's Bullocks Wilshire, in Los Angeles (1929), as well as Adah Robinson and Bruce Goff's Boston Avenue Methodist Church, Tulsa (1929). In the 1920s the Griffins prepared plans for the Milleara Estate (also known as City View) at Avondale Heights and the Ranelagh Estate at Mount Eliza, both in Victoria (Australia) in conjunction with surveyors Tuxen and Miller. =Incinerators= Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator, Ipswich, Queensland During the financial hardship of the Great Depression, in the 1930s Griffin designed incinerators, collaborating with the Reverberatory Incinerator and Engineering Company (RIECo), in conjunction with his friend and business partner, Eric Nicholls.The Architecture of Walter Burley Griffin, Donald Leslie Johnson (Macmillan Company of Australia) 1977, p.116 He was responsible for twelve incinerator designs between 1930 and 1938, of which seven still survive. They are located at: * Willoughby, New South Wales * Glebe, New South Wales * Ipswich, Queensland * Essendon, Victoria * Hindmarsh, South Australia * Thebarton, South Australia * Canberra, Australian Capital Territory The Willoughby incinerator is a good example of this work. It has been listed by the National Trust of Australia and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects as a building of significance. In 1999 it was listed in the New South Wales State Heritage Register. It has since been restored and converted to commercial use by Willoughby Council. The Walter Burley Griffin Incinerator in Ipswich, Queensland is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and has been converted into a theatre. Another incinerator was built in the suburb of Pyrmont, not far from the centre of Sydney. This incinerator was considered for heritage listing but was demolished in 1992 because it was in irredeemably bad condition. India During their time at the GSDA, the Griffins became more involved in anthroposophy,Paull, John (2012) \\"Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahoney Griffin, Architects of Anthroposophy\\", Journal of Bio-dynamics Tasmania, 106:20-30. and in 1935 through contacts in the movement Griffin won a commission to design the library at the University of Lucknow in Lucknow, India. Although he had planned to stay in India only to complete the drawings for the library, he soon received more than 40 commissions, including the University of Lucknow Student Union building; a museum and library for the Raja of Mahmudabad; a zenana (women's quarters) for the Raja of Jahangirabad; Pioneer Press building, a bank, municipal offices, many private houses, and a memorial to King George V. He also won complete design responsibility for the 1936‚Äì1937 United Provinces Exhibition of Industry and Agriculture. His 53 projects for the site featured a stadium, arena, mosque, imambara, art gallery, restaurant, bazaar, pavilions, rotundas, arcades, and towers,Walter Burley Griffin Society, Inc., Walter Burley Griffin however, only part of his elaborate plans were fully executed.Australian Dictionary of Biography, Griffin, Walter Burley (1876‚Äì1937) Griffin was inspired by the architecture and culture of India, modifying forms as \\"he sought to create a modern Indian architecture ... Griffin was able to expand his aesthetic vocabulary to create an exuberant, expressive architecture reflecting both the 'stamp of the place' and the 'spirit of the times'\\".Kruty, Paul & Maldre, Mati, Walter Burley Griffin in America, Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1996, pp. 76‚Äì81 While in India, Griffin also published numerous articles for the Pioneer, writing about architecture, in particular about ventilation design improvements. Marion joined Walter in Lucknow in April 1936 to collaborate on several projects. =Death and burial in India= Griffin died of peritonitis in early 1937, five days after gall bladder surgery at King George's Hospital, Lucknow in Lucknow city in state of Uttar Pradesh, India, and was buried in Christian Cemetery in Lucknow. Marion Mahony Griffin oversaw the completion of the Pioneer Building that he had been working on at the time of his death. She closed down their Indian offices, then left their Australian practice in the hands of Griffin's partner, Eric Milton Nicholls, and returned to Chicago. Legacy Griffin was largely under-appreciated during his time in Australia, but since his death recognition of his work has steadily grown. In 1964, when Canberra's central lake was filled, as Griffin had intended, Prime Minister Robert Menzies declined to have the lake named after himself. Instead he named it Lake Burley Griffin, making it the first \\"monument\\" in Canberra dedicated to the city's designer (\\"Burley\\" was included in the name because of the misconception, which has continued, that it was part of Griffin's surname). Architectural drawings and other archival materials by and about the Griffins are held by numerous institutions in the United States, including the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University; the Block Gallery at Northwestern University; the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago; and the New York Historical Society, as well as in several repositories in Australia, including the National Library of Australia, National Archives of Australia, and the Newman College Archives of the University of Melbourne. At the centenary of the Griffins' design work for Canberra, some believe they are owed a permanent memorial.Vernon, Christopher 'Let's Not Forget the Griffins', The Canberra Times, Panorama magazine, May 17, 2014 p6, from Australian Design Review, April 2013.

He transformed magic from a pastime for the lower classes, seen at fairs, to an entertainment for the wealthy, which he offered in a theatre opened in Paris, a legacy preserved by the tradition of modern magicians to perform in tails. Early life and entrance into conjuring Robert-Houdin was born Jean-Eug√®ne Robert in Blois, France, on 7 December 1805 ‚Äî a day after his autobiography said he was.Illustrated History of Magic by Milbourne Christopher 1973 His father, Prosper Robert, was a watchmaker in Blois. Jean-Eugene's mother, the former Marie-Catherine Guillon, died when he was just a young child. At the age of eleven, Prosper sent his son Jean-Eug√®ne to school thirty-five miles up the Loire to the University of Orl√©ans. At 18, he graduated and returned to Blois. His father wanted him to be a lawyer, but Robert-Houdin wanted to follow into his father's footsteps as a watchmaker. =Apprentice clockmaker= His penmanship was excellent, and it landed him a job as a clerk for an attorney's office. Instead of studying law, he tinkered with mechanical gadgets. His employer sent him back to his father. He was told that he was better suited as a watchmaker than a lawyer, but by then, Jean's father had already retired, so he became an apprentice to his cousin who had a watch-shop. For a short time, Jean-Eug√®ne worked as a watchmaker. In the mid-1820s, he saved up to buy a copy of a two-volume set of books on clockmaking called Trait√© de l'horlogerie (\\"Treatise on Clockmaking\\"), written by Ferdinand Berthoud. He would go on to pursue the craft of clockmaking for the rest of his life, and is widely credited with inventing the mystery clock. =Introduction to magic= When he got home and opened the wrapping, instead of the Berthoud books, what appeared before his eyes was a two-volume set on magic called Scientific Amusements. Instead of returning the books, his curiosity got the better of him. From those crude volumes, he learned the rudiments of magic. He practiced at all hours of the day. From that point on, he became very interested in the art. He was upset that the books he got only revealed how the secrets were done but did not show how to do them. He found that learning from the books available in those days was very difficult due to the lack of detailed explanations, but the books piqued his interest in the art. So Jean-Eug√®ne began taking lessons from a local amateur magician. He paid ten francs for a series of lessons from a man named Maous from Blois who was a podiatrist but also entertained at fairs and parties doing magic. He was proficient at sleight of hand, and taught Jean-Eug√®ne how to juggle to improve his hand-eye coordination. He also taught him rudiments of the cups and balls. He told young Jean-Eug√®ne that digital dexterity came with repetition, and as a direct result, Jean-Eug√®ne practiced incessantly. Magic was his pastime, and meanwhile, his studies in horology continued. When he felt he was ready, he moved to Tours and set up a watchmaking business, doing conjuring on the side. Much of what we know about Robert-Houdin comes from his memoirs‚Äîand his writings were meant more to entertain than to chronicle, rendering it difficult to separate fact from fiction. Robert-Houdin would have readers believe that a major turning point in his life came when he became apprenticed to the magician Edmund De Grisi, Count's son and better known as Torrini. What is known is that his early performing came from joining an amateur acting troupe. =Marriage to Jos√®phe Cecile Houdin= Later, he performed at social parties as a professional magician in Europe and the United States. It was during this period while at a party that he met the daughter of a Parisian watchmaker, Jacques-Fran√ßois Houdin, who had also come from Jean-Eug√®ne Robert's native Blois. The daughter's name was Jos√®phe Cecile Houdin, and Jean-Eug√®ne fell in love with her at their first meeting. On 8 July 1830, they were married. He hyphenated his own name to hers and became Robert-Houdin. He and Jos√®phe had eight children, of whom three survived. He moved to Paris and worked in his father-in-law's wholesale shop. Jacques-Fran√ßois was among the last of the watchmakers to use the old method of handcrafting each piece and embraced his new son-in-law's ambitions for mechanism. While Houdin worked in the main shop, Jean-Eug√®ne was to tinker with mechanical toys and automatic figures. With his work in the shop, Jean-Eug√®ne was still practicing magic. Quite by accident, Robert-Houdin walked into a shop on the Rue Richelieu and discovered that it sold magic. He visited the store, which was owned by a P√®re (Papa) Roujol. There, he met fellow magicians, both amateur and professional, where he engaged in talk about conjuring, and he met an aristocrat by the name of Jules de Rov√®re, who coined the term \\"prestidigitation\\" to describe a major misdirection technique magicians used. At Papa Roujol's, Robert-Houdin learned the details to many of the mechanical tricks of the time as well as how to improve them. From there, he built his own mechanical figures, like a singing bird, a dancer on a tightrope, and an automaton doing the cups and balls. His most acclaimed automaton was his writing and drawing figure. He displayed this figure before King Louis Philippe and eventually sold it to P. T. Barnum. On 19 October 1843, Jos√®phe died at the age of thirty-two, having been ill for months. At her death, having three young children to take care of, he remarried in August to Fran√ßois Marguerite Olympe Braconnier, a woman ten years younger, who soon took over the household. Robert-Houdin loved to watch the big magic shows that came to Paris. He dreamed about some day opening his own theatre. In the meantime, he was hired by a friend by the name of Count de l'Escalopier to perform at private parties. Now that he had free time, he began constructing equipment for his own use instead of selling it to others. The income from the shop and his new inventions gave him enough money to experiment on new tricks using glass apparatus that would be (or at least appear to be) free of trickery. He envisioned a stage that would be as elegant as the drawing rooms in which he was hired to perform. He also thought that a magician should be dressed as such by wearing traditional evening clothes. =Opening the \\"Palais Royale\\"= He obtained financial backing from Count de l'Escalopier, who fronted him the 15,000 francs to turn his vision into reality. He rented out a suite of rooms above the archways around the gardens of the Palais Royal, which was once owned by Cardinal Richelieu. He hired workmen to redesign the old assembly room into a theatre. They painted it white with gold trim. Tasteful drapes were hung, chic candelabras were placed throughout, and the stage furniture was set in the style of Louis XV. On 3 July 1845, Robert-Houdin premiered his 200-seat Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin in what he called \\"Soir√©es fantastiques\\". No critics covered Robert-Houdin‚Äôs debut, and in his memoirs, Robert-Houdin said that the show had been a disaster. He suffered from stage fright that caused him to talk too fast and in a monotone. He said that he did not know what he was saying or doing, and everything was a blur. He believed that a magician should not present a trick until it was mechanically perfected to be certain of avoiding failure, and this caused him to over-rehearse. After the first show, he was about to have a nervous breakdown. He closed the theatre and had every intention to close it for good, until a friend agreed that the venture was a silly idea. Instead of admitting defeat, Robert-Houdin, irked at the friend's effrontery, used this insult to regain his courage, and persevered in giving the show a long run at his little theatre. Although the forty-year-old magician was unpolished at first, he soon gained the confidence required for the stage. With each performance, Robert- Houdin got better, and he began to receive critical acclaim. Le Charivari and L'Illustration both said that his mechanical marvels and artistic magic was comparable to those of his predecessors like Philippe and Bartolomeo Bosco. Even with all of this, still relatively few people would come to the little theatre during the summer months, and he struggled to keep it open. To meet expenses, he sold the three houses that he had inherited from his mother. The following year, he added a new trick to his programme that became especially popular. Seats at the Palais Royal were at a premium. This new marvel was called Second Sight. Second Sight drew the audiences into the little theatre. Once there, they saw the other creations Robert-Houdin had to offer. He also performed outside Paris, sometimes with local magicians, as he did in Li√®ge in 1846 with the then well-known Belgian magician Louis Courtois. Statue in front of Robert-Houdin's home in Blois Famous illusions Robert-Houdin felt that every magic programme should be arranged so one trick builds upon the others. One surprise should lead to an even bigger surprise. Some of the tricks and illusions Robert-Houdin presented became classics. Here are a few of them. =Second sight= When Robert-Houdin first opened his theatre, it was sparsely attended and he realized that he needed something more extraordinary that would bring the public to his theatre. So he came upon the idea of doing a two-person mind-reading act, concocting a silly story about how his son Emile had created a game of hot and cold that resulted in Robert-Houdin using it for the stage. He named the trick \\"Second Sight\\", a title that was already used by magicians such as John Henry Anderson, but the effect was entirely different. Anderson had a box into which items were inserted. The medium would then describe the contents inside. In Robert-Houdin's version, he walked into the audience and touched items that the audience held up, and his blindfolded assistant, played by his son, described each one in detail. It caused a sensation and brought the throng to see his shows. Eventually, Robert-Houdin changed the method, so instead of asking his son what was in his hands, he simply rang a bell. This stunned those that suspected a spoken code. He would even set the bell off to the side and remain silent, and his son still described every object handed to his father. Robert-Houdin even made the test difficult. He placed a glass of water into his son's hands, and Emile proceeded to drink from it. He was able to perceive the taste of the liquids that spectators from the audience merely thought of. Even then, the audiences were not entirely convinced; they tried to trip up Emile by bringing in books written in Greek, or odd tools such as a thread counter. =The ethereal suspension= During Robert-Houdin's time, all of Paris was enthusiastically talking about the mysterious uses of \\"ether\\". He took advantage of this by presenting an illusion that appeared to use the pungent liquid. He told the audience that he had discovered a marvelous new property of ether. \\"If one has a living person inhale this liquid when it is at its highest degree of concentration, the body of the patient for a few moments becomes as light as a balloon,\\" Robert-Houdin claimed. He proceeded to \\"prove\\" just that. He placed three stools on a wooden bench. His youngest son Eug√®ne stood on the middle one. With the instructions from his father, he extended his arms. Robert- Houdin placed two canes on top of the stools and positioned them under his son's arms. He took a vial of ether and opened it. The audience smelled it wafting through the theatre. He placed the vial under his son's nose, and he went limp. In reality, the vial was empty, with the odour being produced by his son Emile pouring real ether on a hot iron shovel. Robert-Houdin took the stool away from his son's feet, and he just hung limp as a rag. He took away one of the canes, so he was dangling by one arm, and carefully placed his head against his upraised hand. This was startling enough. What he did next was stunning. He lifted his boy upright in a horizontal position by his little finger and then let go until he was suspended in mid air. Robert-Houdin stepped away to leave his son in that suspended state, balanced only by his right elbow and no other support. When it was apparent that the drug was wearing off, Robert-Houdin returned his son to his upright position. When he woke up, he seemed no worse for wear. Robert-Houdin built up the surprise of spectators until, \\"‚Ä¶ by gradually heightening it up to the moment when, so to speak, it exploded.\\" This brought letters of protest against Robert-Houdin, thinking he was putting his son's health in jeopardy, although the ether had nothing to do with the trick. Robert-Houdin was not the first to perform the Levitation Illusion. The first in Europe was Ching Lau Lauro in 1832 or 1833.Houdini, Harry, Unmasking of Robert-Houdin (New York: Publishers Printing Co., 1908) (Kindle edition: ASIN B003P9X4BA) Retrieved 14 December 2013. =The Marvelous Orange Tree= On one of Robert-Houdin's side tables, he had an egg, a lemon, and an orange. He went into the audience and borrowed a lady's handkerchief that was in style then. He rolled it into a ball. He rubbed the ball in between his hands, and the handkerchief got smaller and smaller until it disappeared, passing through to the egg on the table. Carefully, he picked up the egg. The audience expected him to crack it open and produce the spectator's handkerchief. Instead, he made that disappear too. He told the audience that the egg went to the lemon. This was repeated with the lemon and the orange. When he made the orange disappear, all that was left was a fine powder. This was placed into a silver vial. He soaked this vial with alcohol and set it on fire. A small orange tree planted in a wooden box was brought forth by one of his assistants. The audience noticed that the tree was barren of any blossoms or fruit. The blue flame from the vial was placed underneath it. The vapors from it caused the leaves to spread and sprout orange blossoms from it. Robert-Houdin then picked up his magic wand and waved it. The flowers disappeared and oranges bloomed forth. He plucked the oranges from the tree and tossed them to the audience to prove they were real. He did this until he only had one left. He waved his wand again, and the orange split open into four sections, revealing a white material of sorts inside of it. Two clockwork butterflies appeared from behind the tree. The butterflies grabbed the end of the corner of the white cloth and spread it open, revealing the spectator's handkerchief. The Marvelous Orange Tree trick was used by the eponymous conjurer in Steven Millhauser's short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\" and its film adaptation The Illusionist (2006), where a more complex variant is shown. It is also alluded to in Donald Barthelme's short story \\"Sentence\\". =Robert-Houdin's portfolio= Robert-Houdin brought in a large portfolio used for holding documents or art work under his arm. The portfolio was only about one and three quarters of an inch thick, too small or too thin to hold anything but pictures. He set it on two thin trestles to hold the case with the spine facing the audience. He removed the expected drawings from it. One of those pictures showed a bareheaded woman. Then, he produced two lady's bonnets decorated with flowers; one for winter, the other for summer. He lowered the flap for each production. Then, he showed a picture of birds, followed by a stuffed bird flat as a pancake. With that, he proceeded to produce from the portfolio four live turtle doves. He showed a picture of a cartoon of two cooks fighting with pots. This was followed by three enormous copper pots. One was filled with beans, another with flames bursting forth, and the third pot was filled with boiling water. As an afterthought, he lifted the top flap of the portfolio and pulled out a large cage filled with birds. He walked forward towards the audience with the square cage, and they applauded thinking the trick was over. \\"Nothing here now ‚Äì neither anything, nor anybody,\\" he said as he knocked on the upright flap. For a finale, he closed the portfolio one last time and produced his young son from it. =The light and heavy chest= The number of tricks he invented for his theatre was extensive, but his most remarkable one was the \\"Light and Heavy Chest\\". He took advantage of the infancy of the usage of electricity, especially the then-novelty of Hans Christian √òrsted's discovery of electromagnetism, to his advantage. Robert-Houdin brought on a small wooden box about a foot wide. He said that he had found a way to protect it from thieves. He asked a spectator to lift it, usually a small child. The child lifted it with ease. Then, he brought an adult male up from the audience and asked him to lift the same box. The adult male was unable to lift the box. Inventions pirated Robert- Houdin's inventions were pirated by his trusted mechanic Le Grand, who was arrested for making and selling duplicate illusions. Many of those illusions fell into the hands of his competitors, such as John Henry Anderson, Robin, Robert Heller, and Compars Herrmann. It is not known whether Herrmann or the others bought the illusions directly from LeGrand or from another source, but they willingly performed the illusions after knowing that they were invented by Robert-Houdin. Robert-Houdin on tour Robert-Houdin's little theatre became a mecca for magic enthusiasts. Herrmann was a constant visitor to the Palais Royal. The public complained, because Robert-Houdin could not magically make his theatre bigger. It became the place for the Paris elite to go. Even King Louis Philippe rented out the room for a private performance. After the triumph he gave at the Royal Palace, in 1847, the king decided to take his entourage to see Robert-Houdin at the Palais Royal. The following February, a revolution ended the reign of Louis-Philippe. With it, show business also ended. The Revolution closed all Parisian theatres. Robert-Houdin shut down his theatre and went on the road. He toured the Continent briefly, and then he headed off to Great Britain. With a company of French dramatists, Robert- Houdin made his English debut at the St. James Theatre in London. He presented his programme three times a week. Much to his dismay, he found out that Compars Herrmann beat him to the territory. Not only was he billing himself as \\"the Premier Prestidigitateur of France\\", but he was also using pirated versions of his illusions. Despite this, Robert-Houdin still accomplished a success there. So much so, in 1848, he did a command performance for Queen Victoria. After a three-month tour of England, he went back home after about a year and a half away. He reopened the theatre and became a permanent fixture in Paris. In 1850, he handed the Palais Royal to his brother-in-law Hamilton (Pierre Etienne Chocat). This left him free to tour France. He did so for two years. Then he went to Germany and on a return engagement to England, where he ended up performing a second time for Queen Victoria. He did a brief tour of France and then, at the age of 48, retired from public performances. He gave the theatre back to Hamilton, who continued to fill the little theatre. After Robert-Houdin retired, he devoted himself to his inventions with electricity and his writings. His home, \\"Le Prieur√©\\" (the Priory), was a marvel in advancement. His home was run entirely by electricity. Magic mission to Algeria In 1856, he was asked by Louis-Napoleon to pacify the tribes in French Algeria. During this period, the French Army commanders maintained order in the newly pacified region. They supervised local Muslim administrations and the \\"bureaux arabes\\". These areas were closed off to colonization by the Europeans. Napoleon III was worried about religious leaders called Marabouts. The Marabouts were able to control their tribe with their faux magical abilities. They advised their leaders to break ranks with the French. Napoleon wanted Robert-Houdin to show that French magic was stronger. The magical mission began with an informal show at the Bab Azoun Theatre in Algeria, where he would give performances twice weekly. He also gave many special galas before the country's tribal chiefs. He used The Light and Heavy Chest during these performances, but instead of playing it for comedy as he had in Paris, here he played it straight. Robert-Houdin once invited the strongest tribesman on stage and asked the Arabian to pick up the wooden chest placed on stage. The Arabian picked it up with no problem. Then Robert-Houdin announced that he was going to sap his strength. He waved his wand and declared: \\"Contemplez! Maintenant vous √™tes plus faible qu'une femme; essayez de soulever la bo√Æte.\\" (\\"Behold! Now you are weaker than a woman; try to lift the box.\\") The Arabian pulled on the handle of the chest, but it would not budge. He tried and tried until he tried to rip it apart. Instead, he screamed in pain, as Robert-Houdin had rigged the box to give the Arabian an electrical shock if he tried to rip the handles off. The Arabian let go of the handle, ran off into the aisle, and ran screaming out of the theatre. After his performances were done, he gave a special presentation for several chief men of their tribe. He was invited to the home of the head of the tribe of the desert interior, Bou-Allem. In dawn of the Arab desert, Robert-Houdin was challenged to do a special trick. He obliged by inviting one of the rebels to shoot at him with a marked bullet, which he caught between his teeth. He was given a certificate from Bou-Allem, who wore a red robe symbolizing his loyalty to France. With this scroll praising his mysterious manifestations, Robert-Houdin went back to France with the mission accomplished. \\"The blow was struck\\", Robert-Houdin said, \\"... henceforth the interpreters and all those who had dealings with the Arabs received orders to make them understand that my pretended miracles were only the result of skill, inspired and guided by an art called prestidigitation, in no way connected with sorcery\\". He went on to say, \\"The Arabs doubtless yielded to these arguments, for henceforth I was on the most friendly terms with them.\\" He was rewarded for his services by the French government for suppressing any possible rebellion. Retirement and death After his mission in Algeria was completed, Robert-Houdin gave his last public performance at the Grand Th√©√¢tre in Marseille, then returned to his home in Saint-Gervais, near his native Blois, where he wrote his memoirs, Confidences d'un Prestidigitateur. He also wrote several books on the art of magic. He lived happily in retirement for about fifteen years, until the advent of the Franco Prussian War. His son Eug√®ne was a captain in a Zouave regiment. On 6 August 1870, Robert-Houdin heard news of his son being mortally wounded at the Battle of Worth. Meanwhile, Hessian Soldiers captured Paris, and Robert-Houdin hid his family in a cave near his property. The Russian soldiers were very rude, according to Robert-Houdin, but he found the Polish soldiers to be a lot kinder. Four days later, Robert-Houdin was to find out that his son had died of his wounds. With the stress from that and the war, his health deteriorated, and he contracted pneumonia. On 13 June 1871, he died of his illness at the age of 65. Name It is incorrect to refer to Jean- Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin as \\"Houdin\\". His last name was Robert-Houdin. His birth name was Jean-Eug√®ne Robert. He married Jos√®phe Cecile Houdin and, under special dispensation from the French government, was allowed to use the hyphenated last name.

The \\"dragons\\" move in and out of the windows in a theatrical display. A statue of Robert-Houdin is at lower right. His home in Blois is open to the public as the publicly owned La Maison de la Magie Robert-Houdin. It is a museum and theatre first opened by his grandson Paul Robert-Houdin in April 1966. As a museum of France and bearing the official label of \\"Mus√©e de France\\", it is the only public museum in Europe that incorporates in one place collections of magic and a site for permanent performing arts. The creation of such a site is directly linked to the personality of Robert-Houdin. Commemorative plaque, 11 rue de Valois in Paris, where one could experience the Soir√©es fantastiques of Robert-Houdin In December 1852, the Theatre Robert-Houdin moved from its original location to the Boulevard des Italiens in Paris. Ownership passed from Hamilton to Cleverman (Fran√ßois Lahire), then to Robert-Houdin's son Emile. Emile was too busy to perform at the theatre, so he arranged for Pierre Edouard Brunnet to present the show. After his death, Emile's widow sold the theatre to Georges M√©li√®s in 1888. M√©li√®s, himself a magician but best known to history as one of the greatest early innovators of film making, later presented his first movies there. He accidentally discovered stop-action special effects and presented his creation at the Theatre Robert-Houdin. One of his classics is A Trip to the Moon. In 1924, the building was demolished. Robert-Houdin's autobiography is The Memoirs of Robert-Houdin. His life and works are also cited in Robertson Davies's \\"Deptford Trilogy\\", notably in the trilogy's third novel, World of Wonders, which takes place on the set of a movie about Robert-Houdin. In his book Hiding the Elephant, Jim Steinmeyer said that every magician of the 20th century was haunted by Robert-Houdin, \\"... who cast an enormous shadow over their generation\\". American magician and escape artist Harry Houdini (born Ehrich Weiss) was so impressed by Robert- Houdin that, after reading his autobiography in 1890, Ehrich adopted the stage name of \\"Houdini\\" in honour of Robert-Houdin. He incorrectly believed that an i on the end of a name meant \\"like\\" in French; but Houdini, his own career and reputation established by that time, later lost his youthful respect for Robert-Houdin, believing that he took undue credit for other magicians' innovations, and wrote The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin in 1908. at Internet Archive Robert-Houdin is often credited as being \\"the father of modern magic\\". Before him, magicians performed in marketplaces and fairs, for the lower classes, but Robert-Houdin performed magic in theatres and private parties for wealthier patrons. He also chose to wear formal clothes, like those of his more upscale audiences, which has become a tradition for many modern magicians who wear tail-coats. Several cities have streets that bear his name: Blois, Bourges, Caen, Paris (11th), Saint-√âtienne, and Saint-Gervais-la-For√™t.

Such titles are adopted for a wide variety of reasons, and may be similar or nearly identical to an individual's birth name. In some situations, though not often, a performer will adopt their title as a legal name. Nicknames and maiden names are sometimes used in person's professional name. Reasons for using a stage name A performer will often take a stage name because their real name is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing; projects an undesired image; is difficult to pronounce or spell; or is already being used by another notable individual, including names that are not exactly the same but still too similar. Sometimes a performer adopts a name which is unusual or outlandish to attract attention. Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity, as is often the case for porn stars, especially if they intend on switching careers. The equivalent concept among writers is called a nom de plume (pen name). In radio, the term \\"radio name\\" or \\"air name\\" is used.  Family connection  Some individuals who are related to a celebrity take a different last name so they are not perceived to have received undue advantage from their family connection. Actor Nicolas Cage, born Nicolas Coppola, chose a new last name to avoid comparisons with his uncle, director Francis Ford Coppola, who gave him his big break in the movie Peggy Sue Got Married. Conversely, individuals who wish to receive benefit from their family connections may take that person's first or last name. Lon Chaney Sr.'s son Creighton spent a number of years appearing in minor roles before renaming himself Lon Chaney Jr. Emilio Estevez and his sister Renee chose not to take their father Martin Sheen‚Äôs professional name and use their birth names; however, their brother Carlos chose to use their father's professional name, and took the name Charlie Sheen. Some children born outside marriage to a celebrity, usually male, parent did the same, namely Jett Williams (Antha Bell Jett), her first name being her mother's family name, and Scott Eastwood (Scott Clinton Reeves), Reeves being his mother's last name. Women who achieve fame after marriage often use their married name as part of their professional name, while women who achieved fame before marriage may continue to use their maiden name or a hyphenated surname. In some cases, the individual may adopt a stage name to avoid confusion with other family members who have similar names. Actor Mark Harmon (Thomas Mark Harmon) uses his middle name professionally to avoid confusion with his father Heisman Trophy winner and former broadcaster Tom Harmon (Thomas Dudley Harmon).  Union rules  Guilds and associations that represent actors, such as the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in the United States and British Actors' Equity Association in the United Kingdom, stipulate that no two members may have identical working names. An actor whose name has already been taken must choose a new name. Notable examples include: Nathan Lane, whose birth name (Joseph Lane) was already in use; Stewart Granger, born James Stewart; and Michael Keaton, born Michael Douglas. Diane Keaton, whose birth name is Diane Hall, took her mother's maiden name as a stage name after learning that there was already a registered actress named Diane Hall in the Actors' Equity Association. Ugly Betty actress Vanessa Williams officially uses \\"Vanessa L. Williams\\" due to SAG guidelines, although the other actress with same first and last name (Vanessa E. Williams) is arguably less notable. Similarly, David Walliams changed one letter in his surname due to there being another \\"David Williams\\". Terry O'Quinn of Lost fame changed his surname from Quinn to O'Quinn as another registered actor already had the name Terrance Quinn. Long-time Simpsons writer and Futurama executive producer David X. Cohen changed his middle initial from S to X because there was already a David S. Cohen registered with the Writer's Guild of America. Julianne Moore was born Julie Anne Smith but found that all variations of that name were already used by other actors. (The rumor that Michael Keaton changed his surname because of an attraction to actress Diane Keaton is incorrect; he chose Keaton because of an affinity for the physical comedy of Buster Keaton.Keaton, Eleanor; Vance, Jeffrey (2001). Buster Keaton Remembered. Harry N. Abrams Inc. pp. 124. . Retrieved July 24, 2012.) A middle name may be adopted in preference to changing a name. In some cases, attaching a generational suffix is sufficient for guild rules; broadcaster David Lawrence is credited as David H. Lawrence XVII as a result of there being sixteen other David Lawrences in show business at the time he received his SAG card. A person hoping to become successful as an entertainer who has a name identical to a name already familiar to the public (in any field of endeavor) may change his/her name in order to avoid having his/her name evoke the other person with the same name. Singer Katy Perry, born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, released her self-titled album under the name Katy Hudson, but later used her mother's maiden name to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson.  Involuntary name changes  A performer may also have had their stage name chosen for them by their agent - such was the case with Barbara Eden, born Barbara Jean Huffman - or, in the heyday of the Hollywood studios, by a movie studio. Joan Rivers (born Joan Alexandra Molinsky) went one step further and named herself after a former agent, Tony Rivers, after he told her to change her name. In the non English- speaking world, an example is the Taiwanese Mandopop girl group S.H.E (composed of Selina Jen, Hebe Tian, and Ella Chen), whose members' English names were chosen by their manager after taking personality tests. Former child star Patty Duke (whose real name is Anna Marie Duke) had her stage name chosen for her by her first managers. Their choice of the name \\"Patty\\" was inspired by another child actress named Patty McCormack. Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach) had his name selected for him by Paramount Pictures. He had been using the name \\"Cary Lockwood\\", but the studio decided against it, deeming it too similar to another actor working at the time. Cary and the studio eventually settled on \\"Cary Grant\\" (Grant thought the letters \\"C\\" and \\"G\\" to be lucky: they had brought previous success for both Clark Gable and Gary Cooper). Joan Crawford, born Lucille Fay LeSueur, had her name changed as a result of a magazine poll organised by her studio, MGM.  Ethnicity  In the past, a stage name was often used when a performer's real name was considered to denote a specific ethnicity that faced potential discrimination. In other cases, actors have reinvented themselves with a more ethnic identity, when that gave them an advantage in playing \\"ethnic\\" roles. Steven Tyler of Aerosmith changed his name from Stephen Victor Tallarico \\"for more promotional appeal\\". Historically, Jews in Hollywood were encouraged to anglicize their names to avoid possible discrimination. Examples of such name changes are Danny Kaye and Mel Brooks, both of whom were born with the surname Kaminsky, the original two lineups of The Three Stooges (born the Horwitz brothers and Louis Feinburg) and Woody Allen (born Allen Konigsberg). Jon Stewart did not anglicize his name for career reasons, but because of his estranged relationship with his father. Israeli-American Natalie Portman changed her name to protect her privacy. Ram√≥n Est√©vez changed his name to Martin Sheen as he felt it affected his job prospects due to racial discrimination and bias, although he maintains his birth name for legal documents such as his passport; his sons made divergent choices: Carlos Irwin Est√©vez is now Charlie Sheen, while Emilio Estevez left his name unchanged. German-born actor Hans Gudegast adopted the stage name of Eric Braeden. Actors Anthony Quinn and Anne Bancroft were advised to anglicize their names because 'Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca' and 'Anna Maria Louisa Italiano', respectively, were considered too 'ethnic' for Hollywood and Broadway at the time. Eydie Gorme (born Edith Garmezano), Sophia Loren (born Sofia Villani Scicolone), Charles Bronson (born Charles Dennis Buchinsky), and Rita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino), are four more well-known examples of this trend. Broadcaster Dave Roberts was born David T. Boreanaz but was known professionally as Dave Thomas and later Dave Roberts as ethnic surnames were discouraged when he first began his career during the 1950s; his son, actor David Boreanaz, chose not to adopt a stage name. The use of stage names for ethnic purposes may vary widely depending on the media market the personality is representing. For example, in Buffalo, New York, a city with a large Polish-American population, Polish-American media personalities typically work freely using their birth names. Sicilian-American actor Espera Oscar de Corti, who built his film career portraying Native Americans, reinvented himself as Iron Eyes Cody. He not only took his stage name as his legal name, but eventually began insisting that he actually was Native American. Chloe Bennet had used her birth name, Chloe Wang, for her singing career in China. She started using the surname Bennet, after her father's first name, when she failed to be welcomed by Hollywood agents.  Ease of use  Another consideration in choosing a stage name is ease of use. The Actors' Equity Association (AEA) advises performers to select a name that is easy for others to pronounce, spell, and remember. Some performers, while paying great attention to their skills and abilities, give little thought to the difference that a well-thought-out name can make to their career. Often a person or group decides on a different name only after they realize that a poorly chosen name gives a bad impression. Actor Michael Caine was born Maurice Micklewhite and chose the name \\"Michael\\" because he preferred the sound of it to the less glamorous-sounding \\"Maurice\\". He reputedly chose the name \\"Caine\\" because at that precise instant he saw a cinema marquee for the then-current movie The Caine Mutiny, and thought that it would make a good last name in conjunction with Michael. (\\"Had I looked the other direction,\\" he later quipped, \\"I'd be known as Michael The One Hundred and One Dalmatians.\\") Similarly, actor Pete Postlethwaite was advised to adopt a different surname by peers who quipped that his \\"would never be put up in lights outside theaters because they couldn't afford the electricity\\" (Postlethwaite rejected the advice). Conversely, Doris Kappelhoff heeded the suggestion of a bandleader who said that her name would never fit on the marquee; since \\"Day By Day\\" had become a signature song for her, she became known to the public as Doris Day.  Relevance to image  Ching Lau Lauro (flourished 1827‚Äì1839) used a Chinese stage name to represent his stage image as a contortionist in Chinese costume. He was probably the first magician to dress in Chinese costume on stage.During, Simon (2004). Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic. London: Harvard University Press. . Retrieved December 12, 2013. Commonly in the music world, and especially those of heavy metal, punk rock, industrial, and hip hop, musicians will rename themselves with names more menacing or striking than their birth names. Every member of the punk band Ramones took the pseudonymous \\"Ramone\\" surname as part of their collective stage persona. Members of New Zealand art-rock band Split Enz all took their middle names as stage names, so as to keep their private image separate from their public personae. Other performers may assume stage names as a means of distancing themselves from publicly known childhood names that could be considered professionally embarrassing, outlandish, or otherwise inappropriate. Film director Duncan Jones (son of singer David Bowie) was known publicly as a child as Zowie Bowie. Hip-hop artists are known to use stage names, such as Jay-Z (born Shawn Carter), 50 Cent (born Curtis Jackson), Diddy (born Sean Combs), Ludacris (born Chris Bridges), Lil Wayne (born Dwayne Carter Jr.), and Soulja Boy (born DeAndre Way). At times, these artists will use their real names to make promoted material seem more authentic or personal. Eminem has used his real name, Marshall Mathers, in various public events and as an alter ego as his real name gained recognition following the release of his multi-platinum album, The Marshall Mathers LP. Similarly, LL Cool J released the albums Mr. Smith and Todd Smith in 1995 and 2006, respectively, under his real name, James Todd Smith. Rapper-singer-actress Queen Latifah released The Dana Owens Album under her own given name, Dana Owens, after changing her musical focus from hip-hop to vocal jazz. Rapper and sometime actor Xzibit has been credited by his real name Alvin Joiner in several television shows. Euphony and ease of remembrance Some performers and artists may choose to simplify their name to make it easier to spell and pronounce, and easier for others to remember. For instance, Fall Out Boy vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump removed the \\"h\\" from his original name, Stumph. It was still pronounced \\"stump,\\" but the change ensured his audience wouldn't think to pronounce it \\"stumf.\\" Singer Jason Derulo uses the phonetic spelling of his given name, Jason Desrouleaux. Andy Warhol dropped an \\"a\\" from his original name, Warhola, while couturier Yves Mathieu-Saint-Laurent dropped the first of his two surnames. Rodolfo Alfonso Raffaello Piero Filiberto Guglielmi adopted the stage name Rudolph Valentino in part because American casting directors found his original surname difficult to pronounce. Singer George Michael (the son of a Greek Cypriot restaurateur in North London) was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou. Some surnames may carry unfortunate connotations. Hal Linden, born Harold Lipshitz, adopted his stage name for fear that the embedded obscenity in his original surname could cost him work. Ralph Lauren's brother (who was his guardian) changed their family name from Lifshitz for a similar reason: fear of mockery. Duran Duran's Nick Rhodes, born Nicholas James Bates, changed his name to escape childhood ridicule (as a child, children would often tease him by calling him \\"Master Bates\\"; he adopted the surname \\"Rhodes\\" after a brand of keyboard). Diana Dors was born Diana Fluck (one letter away from a profanity); this prompted her to change her name to a more benign one in order to avoid an accidental obscenity (which could have been exacerbated by her status as a sex symbol).  Musical use  Some types of music are more associated with stage names than others. For example, hip hop and EDM artists almost always use stage names, whereas \\"classical\\" composers and performers virtually never do. Classical violinist Amad√©us Leopold (born in South Korea as Yoo Hanbin) and opera singers Beverly Sills (born Belle Miriam Silverman) and Nellie Melba (born Helen Porter Mitchell) are rare exceptions. Some Algerian ra√Ø musicians use the prefix Cheb (for men) or Chaba (Chebba) for women. Both Arabic words mean \\"young\\" (e.g. as in Cheb Khaled, or \\"Young Khaled\\"). Some performers take a series of different stage names. The British pop singer successful in the 1970s as Alvin Stardust previously went by the stage name of Shane Fenton in the 1960s. He had been born Bernard William Jewry. Some performers will use different names in different settings. Charles Thompson, singer-songwriter for the alternative band the Pixies, was known in that band as Black Francis. He was called Frank Black as a solo performer, and again called Black Francis in a reunited Pixies. Many performers refer to their stage name as their \\"professional name\\". In some cases, performers subsequently adopt their stage name as their legal name. For instance, the former Robert Allen Zimmerman's legal name has been Robert Dylan (Bob Dylan) since he changed it in New York City Supreme Court in August 1962. Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight but changed his name by deed poll, making Elton Hercules John his real name. When he was knighted, he became Sir Elton Hercules John rather than Sir Reginald Kenneth Dwight. Elvis Costello (born Declan MacManus), who had adopted his professional name as a legal name, changed it back to his birth name in 1986. Another example is Marvin Lee Aday, known by his stage name Meat Loaf. In a similar way, actress and singer Miley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus but found \\"Miley\\" more comfortable, making it her legal name. Entire musical groups have been known to adopt a common stage surname, the most notable arguably being the Ramones. Recent examples include Those Darlins, Los Campesinos! and Ween.

The group consisted of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Bruce was the primary songwriter and vocalist, although Clapton and Baker also sang and contributed songs. Formed from members of previously successful bands, they are widely regarded as the world's first supergroup. Cream were highly regarded for the instrumental proficiency of each of their members. Tensions between Bruce and Baker led to their decision in May 1968 to break up, though the band were persuaded to make a final album, Goodbye, and to tour, culminating in two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968 which were filmed by the BBC and shown in theatres, then in 1977 released as a home video, Farewell Concert. Their music spanned many genres of rock music, including blues rock (\\"Crossroads\\", \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\"), psychedelic rock (\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"White Room\\"), and hard rock (\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"SWLABR\\"). In their career, they sold more than 15 million records worldwide. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire (1968), is the world's first platinum-selling double album.

History =Formation (1966)= By July 1966, Eric Clapton's career with the Yardbirds and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers had earned him a reputation as the premier blues guitarist in Britain. Clapton, however, found the environment of Mayall's band confining, and sought to expand his playing in a new band. In 1966, Clapton met Ginger Baker, then the drummer of the Graham Bond Organisation, for which Jack Bruce had played bass guitar, harmonica and piano. Baker felt stifled in the Graham Bond Organisation and had grown tired of Graham Bond's drug addictions and bouts of mental instability. \\"I had always liked Ginger\\", explained Clapton. \\"Ginger had come to see me play with the Bluesbreakers. After the gig he drove me back to London in his Rover. I was very impressed with his car and driving. He was telling me that he wanted to start a band, and I had been thinking about it too.\\" Each was impressed with the other's playing abilities, prompting Baker to ask Clapton to join his new, then-unnamed group. Clapton immediately agreed, on the condition that Baker hire Bruce as the group's bassist; according to Clapton, Baker was so surprised at the suggestion that he almost crashed the car. Clapton had met Bruce when the bassist/vocalist briefly played with the Bluesbreakers in November 1965; the two also had recorded together as part of an ad hoc group dubbed Powerhouse (which also included Steve Winwood and Paul Jones). Impressed with Bruce's vocals and technical prowess, Clapton wanted to work with him on an ongoing basis. In contrast, while Bruce was in Bond's band, he and Baker had been notorious for their quarrelling. Their volatile relationship included on-stage fights and the sabotage of one another's instruments. After Baker fired Bruce from the band, Bruce continued to arrive for gigs; ultimately, Bruce was driven away from the band after Baker threatened him at knifepoint.Tobler, John and Frame, Pete: Jack Bruce interview, Zigzag # 22, autumn 1971 Baker and Bruce tried to put aside their differences for the good of Baker's new trio, which he envisioned as collaborative, with each of the members contributing to music and lyrics. The band was named \\"Cream\\", as Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were already considered the \\"cream of the crop\\" amongst blues and jazz musicians in the exploding British music scene. Initially, the group were referred to and billed as \\"The Cream\\", but starting officially with its first record releases, the trio came to be known as \\"Cream\\". Despite this, the band was referred to as \\"The Cream\\" on several occasions by promoters and disc jockeys, and even on occasion by the band members themselves. Before deciding upon \\"Cream\\", the band considered calling themselves \\"Sweet 'n' Sour Rock 'n' Roll\\". Of the trio, Clapton had the biggest reputation in England; however, he was all but unknown in the US, having left the Yardbirds before \\"For Your Love\\" hit the American Top Ten. The band made its unofficial debut at the Twisted Wheel on 29 July 1966. Its official debut came two nights later at the Sixth Annual Windsor Jazz & Blues Festival. Being new and with few original songs to its credit, they performed blues reworkings that thrilled the large crowd and earned it a warm reception. In October the band also got a chance to jam with Jimi Hendrix, who had recently arrived in London. Hendrix was a fan of Clapton's music, and wanted a chance to play with him onstage. It was during the early organisation that they decided Bruce would serve as the group's lead vocalist. While Clapton was shy about singing, he occasionally harmonised with Bruce and, in time, took lead vocals on several Cream tracks including \\"Four Until Late\\", \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"World of Pain\\", \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"Crossroads\\", and \\"Badge\\". =Fresh Cream (1966)= The band's debut album, Fresh Cream, was recorded and released in 1966. The album reached number 6 in the UK charts and number 39 in the US. It was evenly split between self-penned originals and blues covers, including \\"Four Until Late\\", \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", \\"Spoonful\\", \\"I'm So Glad\\" and \\"Cat's Squirrel\\". The rest of the songs were written by either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker. (\\"I Feel Free\\", a UK hit single, was included on only the American edition of the LP.) The track \\"Toad\\" contained one of the earliest examples of a drum solo in rock music as Ginger Baker expanded upon his early composition \\"Camels and Elephants\\", written in 1965 with the Graham Bond Organisation. Early Cream bootlegs display a much tighter band showcasing more songs. All of the songs are reasonably short, including five-minute versions of \\"N.S.U.\\", \\"Sweet Wine\\" and \\"Toad\\". But a mere two months later, the setlist shortened, with the songs then much longer. =Disraeli Gears (1967)= The band first visited the US in March 1967 to play nine dates at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York City. There was little impact, as impresario Murray the K placed them at the bottom of a six-act bill that performed three times per date, eventually reducing the band to one song per concert. They returned to record Disraeli Gears in New York between 11 and 15 May 1967.GP Flashback : Cream, June 1967 ‚Äì Guitar Player Article ‚Äì June 1967 This, the band's second album, was released in November 1967 and reached the top five in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Produced by Felix Pappalardi (who later co-founded the Cream-influenced quartet Mountain) and engineer Tom Dowd, it was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York. Disraeli Gears is often considered to be the band's defining effort, successfully blending psychedelic British rock with American blues. Disraeli Gears also included \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", which became the group's unofficial anthem, and is probably their best-known song today. Bruce and Pete Brown came upon the idea in a state of near desperation in the wee hours. In a last-ditch attempt to salvage something from the long and fruitless night at his apartment, the bleary-eyed Bruce pulled out his double bass again and played a riff. At that point, Brown looked out the window and saw the sun was about to rise: \\"It's getting near dawn\\", he said to himself. Brown put the words on paper then thought some more: \\"When lights close their tired eyes\\". Cream performing on Dutch television in January 1968 The album was originally slated for release in the summer of 1967, but the record label opted to scrap the planned cover and repackage it with a new psychedelic cover, designed by artist Martin Sharp, and the resulting changes delayed its release for several months. The cover was remarkable for the time, with a psychedelic design patterned over a publicity photo of the trio. Although the album is considered one of Cream's finest efforts, it has never been well represented in the band's live sets. Although they consistently played \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", several songs from Disraeli Gears were quickly dropped from performances in mid-1967, favouring longer jams instead of short pop songs. \\"We're Going Wrong\\" was the only additional song from the album the group performed live. In fact, at their 2005 reunion shows in London, the band played only three songs from Disraeli Gears: \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"We're Going Wrong\\", and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\"; at their three October 2005 performances in New York, \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" was also included in the setlist. In August 1967, the band played their first headlining dates in the US, first at The Fillmore in San Francisco and later at The Pinnacle in Los Angeles. The concerts were a great success and proved very influential on both the band itself and the flourishing hippie scene surrounding them. Upon discovering a growing listening audience, the band began to stretch out on stage, incorporating more time in their repertoire, some songs reaching jams of twenty minutes. Long, drawn-out jams in numbers like \\"Spoonful\\", \\"N.S.U.\\", \\"I'm So Glad\\", and \\"Sweet Wine\\" became live favourites, while songs like \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Crossroads\\", and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" remained reasonably short. =Wheels of Fire (1968)= Cream performing in 1968 In 1968 came the band's third release, Wheels of Fire, which topped the American charts. The album was recorded in a spate of short sessions in from July 1967 to June 1968. Still a relative novelty, the double album of two LP records was well-suited to extended solos. The Wheels of Fire studio recordings showcased the band moving away from the blues and more towards a semi-progressive rock style highlighted by odd time signatures and various orchestral instruments. However, the band did record Howlin' Wolf's \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" and Albert King's \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\". According to a BBC interview with Clapton, the record company, Atco Records, also handling Albert King, asked the band to cover \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", which became a popular track off the record. The opening song, \\"White Room\\", became a radio staple. Another song, \\"Politician\\", was written by the band while waiting to perform live at the BBC. The album's second disc included three live recordings from the Winterland Ballroom and one from the Fillmore. Clapton's second solo from \\"Crossroads\\" has made it to the top 20 in multiple \\"greatest guitar solo\\" lists. After the completion of Wheels of Fire in mid-1968, the band members had grown tired of their exhausting touring schedule and increasingly loud jamming, and wanted to go their separate ways. Baker stated in a 2006 interview with Music Mart magazine, \\"It just got to the point where Eric said to me: 'I've had enough of this', and I said so have I. I couldn't stand it. The last year with Cream was just agony. It damaged my hearing permanently, and today I've still got a hearing problem because of the sheer volume throughout the last year of Cream. But it didn't start off like that. In 1966, it was great. It was really a wonderful experience musically, and it just went into the realms of stupidity.\\" Bruce and Baker's combustible relationship proved even worse as a result of the strain put upon the band by non-stop touring, forcing Clapton to play the perpetual role of peacekeeper. Clapton had also become interested in the music of Bob Dylan's former backing group, now known as the Band, and their debut album, Music from Big Pink, which proved to be a welcome breath of fresh air to Clapton in comparison to the psychedelia and volume that had defined Cream. Furthermore, he had read a scathing Cream review in Rolling Stone, a publication he had much admired, in which the reviewer, Jon Landau, called him a \\"master of the blues clich√©\\". In the wake of that article, Clapton wanted to end Cream and pursue a different musical direction. At the beginning of the band's farewell tour on 4 October 1968, in Oakland, California, nearly the entire set consisted of songs from Wheels of Fire: \\"White Room\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"Crossroads\\", \\"Spoonful\\", and \\"Deserted Cities of the Heart\\", with \\"Passing the Time\\" taking the place of \\"Toad\\" for a drum solo. \\"Passing the Time\\" and \\"Deserted Cities\\" were quickly removed from the setlist and replaced by \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" and \\"Toad\\". =Goodbye and break-up (1968‚Äì1969)= Ginger Baker at the drumkit From its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The antagonism between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough. Equipment during these years had also improved; new Marshall amplifier stacks produced more power, and Jack Bruce pushed the volume levels higher, creating tension for Baker, who would have trouble competing with roaring stacks. Clapton spoke of a concert during which he stopped playing and neither Baker nor Bruce noticed. Clapton has also commented that Cream's later gigs mainly consisted of its members showing off. Cream decided that they would break up in May 1968 during a tour of the US. Later, in July, the band announced that they would break up after a farewell tour of the US and after playing two concerts in London. Cream were eventually persuaded to do one final album, appropriately titled Goodbye. The album was recorded in late 1968 and released in early 1969, after the band had broken up. It comprised six songs: three live recordings dating from a concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, California, on 19 October, and three new studio recordings (including \\"Badge\\", which was written by Clapton and George Harrison, who also played rhythm guitar and was credited as \\"L'Angelo Misterioso\\"). \\"I'm So Glad\\" was included among the live tracks. Cream's farewell tour consisted of 22 shows at 19 venues in the US from 4 October to 4 November 1968, and two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968. The final US gig was at the Rhode Island Auditorium on 4 November. The band arrived late and, due to local restrictions, were able to perform only two songs, \\"Toad\\" and a 20+ minute version of \\"Spoonful\\". The two Royal Albert Hall concerts were filmed for a BBC documentary and released on video (and later DVD) as Farewell Concert. Both shows were sold out and attracted more attention than any other Cream concert, but their performance was regarded by many as below standard. Baker himself said of the concerts: \\"It wasn't a good gig ... Cream was better than that ... We knew it was all over. We knew we were just finishing it off, getting it over with.\\" Bruce had three Marshall stacks on stage for the farewell shows but one acted only as a spare, and he only used one or two, depending on the song. In an interview from Cream: Classic Artists, he added that the band was getting worse by the minute. Jack Bruce performing on Dutch television in 1968 =Post-Cream= Eric Clapton performing in Barcelona years after leaving Cream, 1986 Blind Faith, a band that included both Clapton and Baker, was formed after the demise of Cream, following an attempt by Clapton to recruit Steve Winwood into Cream in the hope that he would help act as a buffer between Bruce and Baker. Inspired by more song-based acts, Clapton went on to perform much different, less improvisational material with Delaney & Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos, and in his own long and varied solo career. Bruce began a varied and successful solo career with the 1969 release of Songs for a Tailor, while Baker formed a jazz-fusion ensemble out of the ashes of Blind Faith called Ginger Baker's Air Force, with Winwood, Blind Faith bassist Rick Grech, Graham Bond on saxophone, and guitarist Denny Laine of the Moody Blues and (later) Wings. All three members continued to explore new musical ideas and partnerships, play concerts and record music for over four decades after ending Cream. =Reunions= Rock and Roll Hall of Fame In 1993, Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and re-formed to perform at the induction ceremony. Initially, the trio were wary about performing, until encouraging words from Robbie Robertson inspired them to try. Eric Clapton said, when they accepted their award: \\"I have to be honest and say that until very recently I didn't believe in this institution at all. It seemed to me that rock & roll should never be respectable. And then a friend of mine, not so long ago, Robbie Robertson, pointed out that minor and major miracles take place in here. It deeply moved me. I looked at this from a different point of view and learned that a lot can be gained by coming here tonight. A lot has been gained. I've been reunited with two people that I lover very dearly. It's very moving. Yesterday, we played together for the first time in 25 years. It was pretty amazing.\\" The set consisted of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"Crossroads\\", and \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", a song they had not previously played live. Clapton mentioned in his acceptance speech that their rehearsal the day before the ceremony had marked the first time they had played together in 25 years. This performance spurred rumours of a reunion tour. Bruce and Baker said in later interviews that they were, indeed, interested in touring as Cream. A formal reunion did not take place immediately, as Clapton, Bruce and Baker continued to pursue solo projects, although the latter two worked together again in the mid-1990s as two-thirds of the power trio BBM with Irish blues rock guitarist Gary Moore. 2005 concerts At Clapton's request, Cream reunited for a series of four shows, on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, the venue of their final concerts in 1968. Although the three musicians chose not to speak publicly about the shows, Clapton would later state that he had become more \\"generous\\" in regard to his past, and that the physical health of Bruce and Baker was a major factor: Bruce had recently undergone a transplant for liver cancer in 2003, and had almost lost his life, while Baker had severe arthritis. Tickets for all four shows sold out in under an hour. The performances were recorded for a live CD and DVD. Among those in attendance were Bill Wyman, Steve Winwood, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Roger Waters, Brian May, Jimmy Page, and Mick Taylor. The reunion marked the first time the band had played \\"Badge\\" and \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" live. Inspired by the success of the reunion, the band agreed to an additional set of three shows at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, from 24‚Äì26 October 2005. According to Clapton, these concerts did not live up to the Royal Albert Hall performances due to, among other reasons, lack of rehearsal and the resurgence of old grudges among band members. =Post-2005= In February 2006, Cream received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of their contribution to, and influence upon, modern music.Cream: Biography. Rolling Stone. Retrieved 25 April 2012Grammys To Salute Bowie, Cream, Haggard, Pryor. Billboard. Retrieved 25 April 2012 That same month, a \\"Classic Albums\\" DVD was released detailing the story behind the creation and recording of Disraeli Gears. On the day prior to the Grammy ceremony, Bruce made a public statement that more one-off performances of Cream had been planned: multiple dates in a few cities, similar to the Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden shows. However, this story was refuted by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in a Times of London article from April 2006. The article stated that when asked about Cream, Clapton said: \\"No. Not for me. We did it and it was fun. But life is too short. I've got lots of other things I would rather do, including staying at home with my kids. The thing about that band was that it was all to do with its limits ... it was an experiment.\\" In an interview in the UK magazine Music Mart, about the release of a DVD about the Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park 1969, Baker commented about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton's, as they were centred around his relationship with Jack Bruce. Ginger said, \\"When he's Dr. Jekyll, he's fine ... It's when he's Mr. Hyde that he's not. And I'm afraid he's still the same. I tell you this ‚Äì there won't ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde in New York last year.\\" When asked to elaborate, Baker replied: Baker and Bruce appeared on stage in London when Baker was awarded a lifetime achievement award by legendary cymbal manufacturer Zildjian. Bruce told Detroit's WCSX radio station in May 2007 that there were plans for a Cream reunion later in the year. It was later revealed that the potential performance was to be November 2007 in London as a tribute to Ahmet Ertegun. The band decided against it and this was confirmed by Bruce in a letter to the editor of the Jack Bruce fanzine, The Cuicoland Express, dated 26 September 2007: The headlining act for the O2 Arena Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert (postponed to December 2007) turned out to be another reunited English hard- rock act, Led Zeppelin. In an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2010, Bruce confirmed that there would be no more Cream shows: \\"Cream is over.\\" Bruce died on 25 October 2014 and Baker died on 6 October 2019, leaving Clapton as the last surviving member.

Harrison started his professional career with the firm of Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, participating in the construction of Rockefeller Center. He is best known for executing large public projects in New York City and upstate, many of them a result of his long and fruitful personal relationship with Nelson Rockefeller, for whom he served as an adviser.Caroline Rob Zaleski, Long Island Modernism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 2012): Pg. 27 Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, seen from Lincoln Center Plaza Career Harrison's work in the mid-twentieth century comprised large, modernist public projects and office buildings. As a young man, Harrison took classes in engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and in architecture at the Boston Architectural Club; he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in the early 1920s and won the Rotch Taveling Scholarship in 1922. He worked for McKim, Mead & White and Bertram Grovesnor Goodhue from 1916 to 1923, and later formed a series of architectural partnerships. Harrison participated with the architectural teams designing the art deco Rockefeller Center complex in New York City, completed in 1939. His brother-in-law was married to John D Rockefeller'Jr's daughter, AbigailIcons of American Architecture: From the Alamo to the World Trade Center By Donald Langmead and Harrison serve as a designer and architectural adviser for Nelson Rockefeller, notably in the years when Rockefeller was governor of New York. In 1941 Harrison joined with Max Abramowitz to form the firm of Harrison & Abramowitz. In partnership with Abramovitz, Harrison designed scores of university and corporate buildings, including the Time & Life (1959) and Socony-Mobil (1956), both designated New York City landmarks.Caroline Rob Zaleski, Long Island Modernism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 2012): Pg. 26 Among Harrison's most noted projects are the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Empire State Plaza in Albany; he also served as Director of Planning on the United Nations complex, which was built on slaughter-house property contributed by the Rockefeller family (the Rockefellers owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue). Harrision also developed the design for the Pershing Memorial in Washington, D.C. (today referred to as Pershing Park, and home to the National World War I Memorial.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 545. In addition to his architectural work, Harrison served as master planner and supervising architect for a number of important Long Island-based projects, including the World's Fairs of 1939 and 1964 in Flushing, Queens, and LaGuardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy) airports. Harrison's major projects are marked by straightforward planning and sensible functionalism, although his residential side-projects show more experimental flair. In 1931, Harrison established an summer retreat in West Hills, New York, which was a very early example and workshop for the International Style in the United States, and a social and intellectual center of architecture, art, and politics. The home includes a circular living room that is rumored to have been the prototype for the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center. Two other circular rooms complete the center of Harrison's design. Frequent visitors and guests included Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Moses, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, Alexander Calder and Fernand L√©ger. Harrison's expansive country property also exhibited his relationships with contemporary architects. For example, shortly after purchasing the property in 1931, Harrison and his wife bought the Aluminaire House, an iconic, compact, ready-to-assemble steel-and-aluminum structure designed by Swiss architect Albert Frey and then editor of Architectural Record, A. Lawrence Kocher.Caroline Rob Zaleski, Long Island Modernism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. 2012): Pg. 29 Harrison collected works by Calder and L√©ger and commissioned new ones for buildings that he designed, including his Long Island country house in West Hills, New York; a pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair; parts of Rockefeller Center; and the United Nations headquarters.Eve M. Kahn (May 8, 2014), A Glimpse of L√©ger, a Good Look at Lalique New York Times. L√©ger waited out part of World War II by painting a mural at the bottom of Harrison's swimming pool. L√©ger also created a large mural for the home's circular living room and sculpted an abstract form to serve as a skylight. Calder's first show is said to have taken place at the home. In 1965, Harrison was appointed to a commission to choose modern art works for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. Between 1941 and 1943, Harrison designed and built the Clinton Hill Coops, a 12-building coop complex split between two \\"campuses\\" along Clinton Ave. in Brooklyn, New York, to house the Brooklyn Navy Yards workers. Harrison's architectural drawings and archives are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University. Harrison was a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1959. In 1967, Harrison received the AIA Gold Medal.Luebke, Civic Art; Richard Guy Wilson, The AIA Gold Medal (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984).

Life and career Hood was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and attended Brown University before enrolling at MIT. As a post-graduate, Hood worked as a draftsman at the architecture firm Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson in Boston. While employed by Cram, Hood worked on the Deborah Cook Sayles Public Library in his hometown of Pawtucket. He was accepted into the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and earned a degree. In 1922, New York architect John Mead Howells, who had met him at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, invited Hood to become his partner in the Chicago Tribune building competition in which Howells had been invited to compete. The design submitted by Howells and Hood won the competition, and Hood, 41, become touted as one of New York's best architects. Hood did not consider himself an artist, but saw himself as \\"manufacturing shelter\\", writing: > There has been entirely too much talk about the collaboration of architect, > painter and sculptor; nowadays, the collaborators are the architects, the > engineer, and the plumber. ... Buildings are constructed for certain > purposes, and the buildings of today are more practical, from the standpoint > of the man who is in them than the older buildings. ... We are considering > effort and convenience much more than appearance or effect.Woolf, S. J. \\"An > Architect Hails the Rule of Reason - Design that is grounded in material and > function ill make buildings more beautiful, says Raymond Hood\\" New York > Times Magazine (November 1, 1931) quoted in Robins, Anthony W. \\"McGraw-Hill > Building Designation Report\\" New York Landmarks Preservation Commission > (September 11, 1979) Hood's design theory was aligned with that of the Bauhaus, in that he valued utility as beauty: > Beauty is utility, developed in a manner to which the eye is accustomed by > habit, in so far as this development does not detract from its quality of > usefulness.Griswold, J. B. \\"Nine Years Ago, Raymond M Hood Was Behind in his > Rent ...

As much as Hood might insist that his designs were largely determined by the practicalities of zoning laws and the restraints of economics, each of his major buildings were different enough to suggest that Hood's design artistry was a significant factor in the final result. While a student at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Hood met John Mead Howells, with whom he later partnered. Hood frequently employed architectural sculptor Rene Paul Chambellan both for architectural sculptures for his building and to make plasticine models of his projects. Hood is believed to have coined the term \\"Architecture of the Night\\" in a 1930 pamphlet published by General Electric.\\"Architecture of the Night\\" General Electric Company (1930) Hood died at age 53 and was interred at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. In fiction Frank HeynickHeynick, Frank. \\"Peter Keating designed Rockefeller Center?\\" on The Atlasphere website (September 7, 2009) has argued from a study of the journal notes of Ayn Rand made in the late 1930s and of incidents in her 1943 novel The Fountainhead, that Raymond Hood's career and works provided fodder for her fictional architect Peter Keating. This major figure in The Fountainhead epitomized the \\"second-hander\\" who ‚Äì in stark opposition to the uncompromising and innovative hero of the novel, Howard Roark, and exemplified in real life by Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Rand idolized ‚Äì adapts the classicist and historicist Old World architectural styles to the new American medium of the skyscraper, and then goes on to adopt modernism as soon as this becomes safely fashionable. Certain specific incidents in the fictional Keating's career are pointed to by Heynick as having been drawn from Hood's real-life career, such as their both suddenly gaining national fame by winning the highly publicized skyscraper contest for a media corporation in the early 1920s with a design in the historicist style, and their both heading the committee for a \\"modernistic\\" World's Fair in the 1930s from which the hero architect (Howard Roark in the novel, Frank Lloyd Wright in real-life) was excluded. Nevertheless, with regard to Rockefeller Center, of which Hood was the chief designer, Rand, despite her earlier negative comments in her journals, was subsequently cited as having some good words for the RCA Building. More intriguingly, as Heynick points out, Rand is quoted in a 1943 newspaper interview as referring to Hood's McGraw-Hill Building as the most beautiful in New York, thus, apparently, seeing Hood in a different light. This, Heynick argues, was justly so. Rand's creating of the negative fictional character of Peter Keating required her to draw exclusively upon the negative aspects of Hood's career as she perceived it. But particularly with reference to the Art Deco mode ‚Äì a style which goes unmentioned in Rand's novel ‚Äì Hood in fact showed his creative versatility in designing two Deco skyscrapers so radically distinct from one another as the RCA Building and the McGraw-Hill Building.

Early life and the Museum of Modern Art exhibition Johnson, by Carl Van Vechten January 18, 1933 Johnson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 8, 1906, the son of a lawyer, Homer Hosea Johnson (1862‚Äì1960), and the former Louisa Osborn Pope (1869‚Äì1957), a niece of Alfred Atmore Pope and a first cousin of Theodate Pope Riddle. He had an older sister, Jeannette, and a younger sister, Theodate. He was descended from the Jansen family of New Amsterdam, and included among his ancestors the Huguenot Jacques Cortelyou, who laid out the first town plan of New Amsterdam for Peter Stuyvesant. He grew up in New London, OhioForms Under Light The New Yorker Retrieved 2018-05-25. and attended the Hackley School, in Tarrytown, New York, and then studied as an undergraduate at Harvard University where he focused on learning Greek, philology, history and philosophy, particularly the work of the Pre-Socratic philosophers. Upon completing his studies in 1927, he made a series of trips to Europe, visiting the landmarks of classical and Gothic architecture, and joined Henry-Russell Hitchcock, a prominent architectural historian, who was introducing Americans to the work of Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and other modernists. In 1928 he met German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was at the time designing the German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. The meeting formed the basis for a lifelong relationship of both collaboration and competition In 1930, Johnson joined the architecture department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. There he arranged for American visits by Gropius and Le Corbusier, and negotiated the first American commission for Mies van der Rohe. In 1932, working with Hitchcock and Alfred H. Barr, Jr., he organized the first exhibition on Modern architecture at the Museum of Modern Art. The show and their simultaneously published book International Style: Modern Architecture Since 1922 played an important part in introducing modern architecture to the American public. His flirtation with fascism and the Nazi party was documented in Marc Wortman's 2016 book 1941: Fighting the Shadow War. It was excerpted by Vanity Fair magazine. When the rise of the Nazis in Germany forced the modernists Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe to leave Germany, Johnson helped arrange for them to come to work in the United States. In 1936, in the depths of the Great Depression, he left the Museum of Modern Art for a brief venture into journalism and politics. He was a Nazi sympathizer and supported the populist Governor of Louisiana Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin. Johnson traveled to Germany and Poland as a correspondent for Coughlin's radically populist and often anti-Semitic newspaper Social Justice. In the newspaper, Johnson expressed, as the New York Times later reported, \\"more than passing admiration for Hitler\\". Johnson observed the Nuremberg Rallies in Germany and, sponsored by the German government, covered the invasion of Poland in 1939. Many years later he told his biographer, Franz Schulze, \\"You simply could not fail to be caught up in the excitement of it, by the marching songs, by the crescendo and climax of the whole thing, as Hitler came on at last to harangue the crowd,\\" and told of being thrilled at the sight of \\"all those blond boys in black leather\\" marching past the F√ºhrer. Schulze dismissed these early political activities as inconsequential, concluding they merited \\"little more substantial attention than they have gained\\" and his politics \\"were driven as much by an unconquerable esthetic impulse as by fascist philosophy or playboy adventurism\\". In 1941, at the age of 35, Johnson abandoned politics and journalism and enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he studied with Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius. In 1941, Johnson designed and actually built his first building, a house that still exists at 9 Ash Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The house, strongly influenced by Mies van der Rohe, has a wall around the lot which merges with the structure. It was used by Johnson to host social events and was eventually submitted as his graduate thesis; he sold the house after the War, and it was eventually purchased by Harvard in 2010 and restored by 2016. After the United States entered World War II in December 1941, Johnson enlisted in the Army. He was investigated by the FBI for his contacts with the German government and his support for Coughlin, who opposed American intervention in the war, but he was cleared for service and entered the army. He spent his army service during the war in the United States.

At the same time, he began working to establish his architectural practice. He built a small house, in the style of Mies, in Saaponack, Long Island in 1946. This was followed by one of his most famous buildings, which he built for himself; the Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut, completed in 1949, which has become a landmark of modern architecture. =The Glass House= Johnson, by Carl Van Vechten, April 10, 1963 The Glass House (1949) that he designed as his own residence in New Canaan was influenced by the Farnsworth House, built shortly before it by Mies van der Rohe, an influence which Johnson never denied. Johnson had curated an exhibit of Mies van der Rohe's at the Museum of Modern Art in 1947, featuring a model of the glass Farnsworth House.Friedman, Alice T., Women and the Making of the Modern House, p 130, New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press (2006), , retrieved via Google Books on August 8, 2010 The house is a 56 foot by 32 foot glass rectangle, sited at the edge of a crest on Johnson's estate overlooking a pond. The building's sides are glass and charcoal-painted steel; the floor, of brick, is not flush with the ground but sits 10 inches above. The interior is an open space divided by low walnut cabinets; a brick cylinder contains the bathroom and is the only object to reach floor to ceiling. The New York Times described it in 2005 as \\"one of the 20th century's greatest residential structures. \\"Like all of Johnson's early work, it was inspired by Mies, but its pure symmetry, dark colors and closeness to the earth marked it as a personal statement; calm and ordered rather than sleek and brittle.\\" Johnson continued to add to the Glass House estate during each period of his career. He added a small pavilion with columns by the lake in 1963, an art gallery set into a hillside in 1965, a postmodern sculpture gallery with a glass roof in 1970; a castle-like library with a rounded tower in 1980; a concrete block tower dedicated to his friend Lincoln Kirstein, the founder of the New York City Ballet; a chain-link \\"ghost house\\" dedicated to Frank Gehry. After completing the Glass House, he completed two more houses in New Canaan in a style similar to that of Mies; the Hodgson House (1951) and the Wiley House (1953). In 1953 he also created an architectural sculpture garden for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. =The Seagram Building= Johnson joined Mies van der Rohe as the New York associate architect for the 39-story Seagram Building (1956). Johnson was pivotal in steering the commission towards Mies by working with Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the CEO of Seagram. The commission resulted in the iconic bronze-and-glass tower on Park Avenue. The building was designed by Mies, and the interiors of the Four Seasons and Brasserie restaurants were designed by Johnson. =Further development= Johnson with plans for his Boston Public Library addition Following the Seagram Building, Johnson built several smaller projects in a more personal, expressive style, with ornament touches and features far from the sobriety of the modernist style; the Synagogue of Port Chester New York, with a plaster vaulted ceiling and narrow colored windows (1954‚Äì56); the Art Gallery of the University of Nebraska with an array of symmetrical arcs (1963); (the Roofless Church in New Harmony, Indiana with a mushroom-shaped roof covered with wood shingles (1960). In 1960 he also built a severely modernist monastery building for in the expansion of St. Anselm's Abbey in Washington, D.C. In the same period, Johnson won commissions to coordinate the master plan of Lincoln Center, New York City's new arts center, and to design that complex's New York State Theater, built in a massive and unadorned modernist style. He also undertook his first foreign commission, the Kunsthalle Bielefeld art museum in Bielefeld, Germany, with a modernist facade clad in dark red stone, and a modernist colonnade of slender pillars (1968). In 1967 Johnson entered a new phase of his career, founding a partnership with architect John Burgee. Johnson and Burgee won commissions for a series of new skyscrapers. including the IDS Center in Minneapolis (1973), and the two matching towers, facing each other like bookends, of Pennzoil Place in Houston, Texas. The two towers of Pennzoil Place have sloping roofs covering the top seven floors and are trapezoidal in form, created to leave two large triangual areas on the site, which are occupied with glass-covered lobbies designed like greenhouses. This idea was widely copied in skyscrapers in other cities. In the late 1970s Johnson applied landscape architecture to two significant projects in Texas. The Fort Worth Water Gardens opened in 1974, creating an urban landscape where visitors experience water in distinct ways. And in 1977 Johnson completed the spiraling white chapel and meditation garden at Thanks-Giving Square in Dallas.

File:Lipstick Building - Philip Johnson.jpgLipstick Building, New York City (1986) =550 Madison Avenue (former AT&T; Building) (1978‚Äì1984)= In 1980, Johnson completed a new building in a startling new style: the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California, a soaring glass neo- Gothic megachurch for the Reverend Robert H. Schuller. It became a Southern California landmark. In 2012 it was purchased by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange to become the cathedral for Orange County. Shortly after the Crystal Cathedral, working in collaboration with John Burgee, he completed one of his most recognizable buildings, the AT&T; building (later named the Sony Building, and now 550 Madison Avenue). Built between 1978 and 1982, a skyscraper with an eight-story high arched entry and a split pediment at the top which resembled an enormous piece of 18th-century Chippendale furniture. It was not the first work of Postmodern architecture‚ÄîRobert Venturi and Frank Gehry had already built smaller scale postmodern buildings, and Michael Graves had completed the Portland Building in Portland Oregon (1980‚Äì82) two years before the AT&T; Building; and most of the building was in a traditional modernist style; but because of its Manhattan location and size it became the most famous example of postmodern architecture. At about the same time as the AT&T; Building, Johnson and Burgee completed other notable postmodern skyscrapers; the Bank of America Center (Formerly Republic Bank Center) in Houston (1983) and the PPG Place, the headquarters of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass company (1979‚Äì1984). Both buildings combined modern materials, construction and scale with suggestions of traditional architecture. The forms of PPG Place suggested the neogothic tower of the Houses of Parliament in London, while the Bank of America Center appeared inspired, on a colossal scale, the stepped houses of Flemish Renaissance architecture.

Burgee, who wanted to play a larger role in the firm negotiated a smaller part for Johnson, and in 1988 the firm's name was changed to John Burgee Architects with Philip as the design consultant. By 1991 Johnson had split with Burgee and opened up his own practice. Working with John Burgee, Johnson did not confine himself to a single style, and was comfortable mixing elements of modernism and postmodernism. For the Cleveland Play House, he built a romanesque brick structure; for the Architecture School at the University of Houston, he said that his model was the French neoclassical architecture of the 18th-century architect French Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. His skyscrapers on the 1980s were clad in granite and marble, and usually had some feature borrowed from historic architecture. In New York he designed the Museum of Television and Radio, (now the Paley Center for Media) (1991). After four years as a solo practitioner, Johnson invited Alan Ritchie to join him as a partner. Ritchie had been a partner for many years in the Johnson-Burgee office and was the partner-in-charge of the AT&T; building and the 190 South Lasalle Street office building. In 1994 they formed the new practice of Philip Johnson>Alan Ritchie Architects. During the next ten years they worked closely together and yet again explored new directions in architecture, designing buildings as sculptural objects. Some of the buildings that expressed this were the Chapel of St. Basil at the university of St. Thomas, the Cathedral of Hope in Dallas, the Habitable Sculpture (a 26-story apartment tower in lower Manhattan), The Children Museum in Guadalajara, Mexico, The Chrysler Center and DDC Showroom in NY. One of his last designs with Alan Ritchie, completed after his death, was the Urban Glass House, a condominium building in lower Manhattan which was an urban expression from his own earlier work, his famous Glass House residence. The final building he designed with Richie was the Pennsylvania Academy of Music building in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which was completed in 2008. Alan Ritchie now continues the Johnson legacy and design excellence and continues to explore the many ideas they developed together. Honors In 1978, Johnson was awarded an American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. In 1979 he became the first recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize the most prestigious international architectural award. In 1991, Johnson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Personal life Johnson was gay. He came out publicly in 1993, and was regarded as \\"the best-known openly gay architect in America.\\" In 1934, Philip Johnson began his first serious relationship with Jimmie Daniels, a cabaret singer. The relationship lasted only one year. Johnson died in his sleep at his Glass House retreat on January 25, 2005, at the age of ninety-eight.

In his will Johnson left his residential compound to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is now open to the public. Art collection and archives As an art collector Johnson had an eclectic eye. He supported avant-garde movements and young artists often before they became widely known. His collection of American art was strong in Abstract expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Neo-Dada, Color Field, Lyrical Abstraction, and Neo-Expressionism and he often donated important works from his collection to institutions like MoMA, and other important private museums and University collections like the Norton Simon Museum, the Sheldon Museum of Art and the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University among many others. Johnson's publicly held archive, including architectural drawings, project records, and other papers up until 1964 are held by the Drawings and Archives Department of Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the Getty, and the Museum of Modern Art. Controversy over Nazi sympathies Between 1932 and 1940, Johnson was an \\"antisemite, fascist sympathizer, and active propagandist for the Nazi government.\\" He attempted to start a fascist party in the United States. As a correspondent for the newspaper Social Justice, which was edited by the antisemitic cleric Father Charles Coughlin, he made several trips to Germany, sympathetically covering the huge Nazi rally at Nuremberg and the German invasion of Poland in 1939. The American correspondent William Shirer who also covered the German invasion of Poland, noted his enthusiasm for the Germans and called him \\"The American fascist.\\" A September 1940 article in Harper's listed Johnson as among leading American Nazis. An FBI investigation found that \\"Johnson had developed extensive contacts with the German Propaganda and Foreign Ministries while in Germany and then returned to propagandize on the Nazis' behalf in the United States.\\" He was not prosecuted. However, when he was considered for a possible government position, an FBI agent sent a memo to J. Edgar Hoover saying, \\"I can think of no more dangerous man to have working in an agency which possesses so many military secrets.\\" In his Social Justice report on his trip to Poland, author Marc Wortman has observed, \\"Johnson declared that the German victory amounted to an unmitigated triumph for the Polish people and that nothing in the war's outcome need concern Americans.\\" Johnson went on to say that German forces had not significantly harmed Polish civilians, and said that \\"99 percent of the towns I visited since the war are not only intact but full of Polish peasants and Jewish shopkeepers.\\" He said reports of Nazi mistreatment of Poles was \\"misinformed.\\" Johnson wrote in Social Justice that \\"Lack of leadership and direction in the state has let the one group get control who always gain power in a nation's time of weakness‚Äîthe Jews,\\" he wrote. In a letter to a friend, he said, \\"We saw Warsaw burn and Modlin being bombed. It was a stirring spectacle.\\" Johnson sought to distance himself from his views on Nazis after the outbreak of World War II. In 1993 he told Vanity Fair, \\"I have no excuse (for) such unbelievable stupidity. ... I don't know how you expiate guilt.\\" In 1956, he donated a design for Congregation Kneses Tifereth Israel in Port Chester, New York. Architecture professor Anat Geva observed in a paper that \\"all critics agree that his design of the Port Chester Synagogue can be considered as his attempt to ask for forgiveness,\\" although Johnson never discussed the matter with the congregation. His biographer Schulze says the design was done \\"out of practicality not so much by shame following an investigation of his political activities.\\" A 2018 New Yorker article notes that \\"in 1964, well after he had been forced to abjure his Nazi past, he insisted in letters that Hitler was 'better than Roosevelt.'\\" Quotations * \\"I got everything from someone.

He appears in Nathaniel Kahn's My Architect, a 2003 documentary about Kahn's father, Louis Kahn. Philip Johnson's Glass House, along with Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House, was the subject of Sarah Morris's 2010 film Points on a Line. Morris filmed at both sites over the course of several months, among other locations including The Four Seasons Restaurant, the Seagram Building, Mies van der Rohe ºs controversial 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments, and Chicago ºs Newberry Library.

His output includes orchestral works such as the Symphonie fantastique and Harold in Italy, choral pieces including the Requiem and L'Enfance du Christ, his three operas Benvenuto Cellini, Les Troyens and B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict, and works of hybrid genres such as the \\"dramatic symphony\\" Rom√©o et Juliette and the \\"dramatic legend\\" La Damnation de Faust. The elder son of a provincial doctor, Berlioz was expected to follow his father into medicine, and he attended a Parisian medical college before defying his family by taking up music as a profession. His independence of mind and refusal to follow traditional rules and formulas put him at odds with the conservative musical establishment of Paris. He briefly moderated his style sufficiently to win France's premier music prize ‚Äì the Prix de Rome ‚Äì in 1830, but he learned little from the academics of the Paris Conservatoire. Opinion was divided for many years between those who thought him an original genius and those who viewed his music as lacking in form and coherence. At the age of twenty-four Berlioz fell in love with the Irish Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson, and he pursued her obsessively until she finally accepted him seven years later. Their marriage was happy at first but eventually foundered. Harriet inspired his first major success, the Symphonie fantastique, in which an idealised depiction of her occurs throughout. Berlioz completed three operas, the first of which, Benvenuto Cellini, was an outright failure. The second, the huge epic Les Troyens (The Trojans), was so large in scale that it was never staged in its entirety during his lifetime. His last opera, B√©atrice et B√©n√©dictbased on Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothingwas a success at its premiere but did not enter the regular operatic repertoire. Meeting only occasional success in France as a composer, Berlioz increasingly turned to conducting, in which he gained an international reputation. He was highly regarded in Germany, Britain and Russia both as a composer and as a conductor. To supplement his earnings he wrote musical journalism throughout much of his career; some of it has been preserved in book form, including his Treatise on Instrumentation (1844), which was influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. Berlioz died in Paris at the age of 65. Life and career =1803‚Äì1821: Early years = Berlioz was born on 11 December 1803, the eldest child of Louis Berlioz (1776‚Äì1848), a physician, and his wife, Marie-Antoinette Jos√©phine, n√©e Marmion (1784‚Äì1838). His birthplace was the family home in the commune of La C√¥te-Saint-Andr√© in the d√©partement of Is√®re, in south-eastern France. His parents had five more children, three of whom died in infancy;Holoman (1989), p. 9 their surviving daughters, Nanci and Ad√®le, remained close to Berlioz throughout their lives.Macdonald, Hugh. \\"Berlioz, (Louis-)Hector\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001.

Barzun, pp. 21 and 60 Louis Berlioz, the composer's father Berlioz's father, a respected local figure, was a progressively-minded doctor credited as the first European to practise and write about acupuncture.Holoman (1989), p. 6 He was an agnostic with a liberal outlook; his wife was a strict Roman Catholic of less flexible views.Crabbe, pp. 16 and 24 After briefly attending a local school when he was about ten, Berlioz was educated at home by his father.Cairns (2000), pp. 30‚Äì31 He recalled in his M√©moires that he enjoyed geography, especially books about travel, to which his mind would sometimes wander when he was supposed to be studying Latin; the classics nonetheless made an impression on him, and he was moved to tears by Virgil's account of the tragedy of Dido and Aeneas.Berlioz, pp. 34‚Äì35 Later he studied philosophy, rhetoric, and ‚Äì because his father planned a medical career for him ‚Äì anatomy.Bloom (2000), p. xiv Music did not feature prominently in the young Berlioz's education. His father gave him basic instruction on the flageolet, and he later took flute and guitar lessons with local teachers. He never studied the piano, and throughout his life played haltingly at best. He later contended that this was an advantage because it \\"saved me from the tyranny of keyboard habits, so dangerous to thought, and from the lure of conventional harmonies\\".Berlioz, p. 41 At the age of twelve Berlioz fell in love for the first time. The object of his affections was an eighteen-year-old neighbour, Estelle Dub≈ìuf. He was teased for what was seen as a boyish crush, but something of his early passion for Estelle endured all his life.Barzun, p. 263; and Cairns (1999), p. 769 He poured some of his unrequited feelings into his early attempts at composition. Trying to master harmony, he read Rameau's Trait√© de l'harmonie, which proved incomprehensible to a novice, but Charles-Simon Catel's simpler treatise on the subject made it clearer to him.Berlioz, p. 40 He wrote several chamber works as a youth,Holoman (1989), p. 13 subsequently destroying the manuscripts, but one theme that remained in his mind reappeared later as the A-flat second subject of the overture to Les Francs-juges. =1821‚Äì1824: Medical student= In March 1821 Berlioz passed the baccalaur√©at examination at the University of Grenoble ‚Äì it is not certain whether at the first or second attemptCairns (2000), pp. 87‚Äì88 ‚Äì and in late September, aged seventeen, he moved to Paris.

Music did not at that time enjoy the prestige of literature in French culture, but Paris nonetheless possessed two major opera houses and the country's most important music library.Anderson, Gordon A., et al. \\"Paris\\" , Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001. Retrieved 19 October 2018. Berlioz took advantage of them all. Within days of arriving in Paris he went to the Op√©ra, and although the piece on offer was by a minor composer, the staging and the magnificent orchestral playing enchanted him. He went to other works at the Op√©ra and the Op√©ra-Comique; at the former, three weeks after his arrival, he saw Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride, which thrilled him. He was particularly inspired by Gluck's use of the orchestra to carry the drama along. A later performance of the same work at the Op√©ra convinced him that his vocation was to be a composer.Cairns (2000), p. 106 The dominance of Italian opera in Paris, against which Berlioz later campaigned, was still in the future,Barzun, p. 41 and at the opera houses he heard and absorbed the works of √âtienne M√©hul and Fran√ßois-Adrien Boieldieu, other operas written in the French style by foreign composers, particularly Gaspare Spontini, and above all five operas by Gluck. He began to visit the Paris Conservatoire library in between his medical studies, seeking out scores of Gluck's operas and making copies of parts of them.Cairns (2000), p. 112 By the end of 1822 he felt that his attempts to learn composition needed to be augmented with formal tuition, and he approached Jean-Fran√ßois Le Sueur, director of the Royal Chapel and professor at the Conservatoire, who accepted him as a private pupil.Holoman (1989), pp. 25‚Äì27 In August 1823 Berlioz made the first of many contributions to the musical press: a letter to the journal Le Corsaire defending French opera against the incursions of its Italian rival.Barzun, p. 47 He contended that all Rossini's operas put together could not stand comparison with even a few bars of those of Gluck, Spontini or Le Sueur.Letter published 12 August 1823, quoted in Cairns (2000), p. 130 By now he had composed several works including Estelle et N√©morin and Le Passage de la mer Rouge (The Crossing of the Red Sea) ‚Äì both since lost.Bloom (2000), p. xv In 1824 Berlioz graduated from medical school, after which he abandoned medicine, to the strong disapproval of his parents. His father suggested law as an alternative profession and refused to countenance music as a career.Cairns (2000), p. 119 He reduced and sometimes withheld his son's allowance, and Berlioz went through some years of financial hardship. =1824‚Äì1830: Conservatoire student= In 1824 Berlioz composed a Messe solennelle. It was performed twice, after which he suppressed the score, which was thought lost until a copy was discovered in 1991. During 1825 and 1826 he wrote his first opera, Les Francs-juges, which was not performed and survives only in fragments, the best known of which is the overture.Cairns (2000), p. 114 In later works he reused parts of the score, such as the \\"March of the Guards\\", which he incorporated four years later in the Symphonie fantastique as the \\"March to the Scaffold\\". Harriet Smithson as Ophelia In August 1826 Berlioz was admitted as a student to the Conservatoire, studying composition under Le Sueur and counterpoint and fugue with Anton Reicha. In the same year he made the first of four attempts to win France's premier music prize, the Prix de Rome, and was eliminated in the first round. The following year, to earn some money, he joined the chorus at the Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s. He competed again for the Prix de Rome, submitting the first of his Prix cantatas, La Mort d'Orph√©e, in July. Later that year he attended productions of Shakespeare's Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on given by Charles Kemble's touring company. Although at the time Berlioz spoke hardly any English, he was overwhelmed by the plays ‚Äì the start of a lifelong passion for Shakespeare. He also conceived a passion for Kemble's leading lady, Harriet Smithson ‚Äì his biographer Hugh Macdonald calls it \\"emotional derangement\\" ‚Äì and obsessively pursued her, without success, for several years. She refused even to meet him. The first concert of Berlioz's music took place in May 1828, when his friend Nathan Bloc conducted the premieres of the overtures Les Francs-juges and Waverley and other works. The hall was far from full, and Berlioz lost money. Nevertheless, he was greatly encouraged by the vociferous approval of his performers, and the applause from musicians in the audience, including his Conservatoire professors, the directors of the Op√©ra and Op√©ra-Comique, and the composers Auber and H√©rold.Holoman (1989), p. 51; and Cairns (2000), pp. 277 and 279 Berlioz's fascination with Shakespeare's plays prompted him to start learning English during 1828, so that he could read them in the original. At around the same time he encountered two further creative inspirations: Beethoven and Goethe. He heard Beethoven's third, fifth and seventh symphonies performed at the Conservatoire, and read Goethe's Faust in G√©rard de Nerval's translation. Beethoven became both an ideal and an obstacle for Berlioz ‚Äì an inspiring predecessor but a daunting one.Bonds, p. 419 Goethe's work was the basis of Huit sc√®nes de Faust (Berlioz's Opus 1), premiered the following year and reworked and expanded much later as La Damnation de Faust.Holoman (1989), p. 305 =1830‚Äì1832: Prix de Rome= Berlioz was largely apolitical, and neither supported nor opposed the July Revolution of 1830, but when it broke out he found himself in the middle of it. He recorded events in his M√©moires: The cantata was La Mort de Sardanapale, with which he won the Prix de Rome. His entry the previous year, Cl√©op√¢tre, had attracted disapproval from the judges because to highly conservative musicians it \\"betrayed dangerous tendencies\\", and for his 1830 offering he carefully modified his natural style to meet official approval. During the same year he wrote the Symphonie fantastique and became engaged to be married.Bloom (2000), p. xvi Marie (\\"Camille\\") Moke, later Pleyel By now recoiling from his obsession with Smithson, Berlioz fell in love with a nineteen-year-old pianist, Marie (\\"Camille\\") Moke. His feelings were reciprocated, and the couple planned to be married.Barzun, p. 98 In December Berlioz organised a concert at which the Symphonie fantastique was premiered. Protracted applause followed the performance, and the press reviews expressed both the shock and the pleasure the work had given.Barzun, p. 107 Berlioz's biographer David Cairns calls the concert a landmark not only in the composer's career but in the evolution of the modern orchestra.Cairns (2000), p. 426 Franz Liszt was among those attending the concert; this was the beginning of a long friendship. Liszt later transcribed the entire Symphonie fantastique for piano to enable more people to hear it.Kregor, pp. 43‚Äì46 Shortly after the concert Berlioz set off for Italy: under the terms of the Prix de Rome, winners studied for two years at the Villa Medici, the French Academy in Rome. Within three weeks of his arrival he went absent without leave: he had learnt that Marie had broken off their engagement and was to marry an older and richer suitor, Camille Pleyel, the heir to the Pleyel piano manufacturing company.Evans, p. 27 Berlioz made an elaborate plan to kill them both (and her mother, known to him as \\"l'hippopotame\\"),Cairns (2000), p. 422 and acquired poisons, pistols and a disguise for the purpose. By the time he reached Nice on his journey to Paris he thought better of the scheme, abandoned the idea of revenge, and successfully sought permission to return to the Villa Medici. He stayed for a few weeks in Nice and wrote his King Lear overture. On the way back to Rome he began work on a piece for narrator, solo voices, chorus and orchestra, Le Retour √† la vie (The Return to Life, later renamed L√©lio), a sequel to the Symphonie fantastique. Berlioz when a student at the Villa Medici, 1832 Berlioz took little pleasure in his time in Rome. His colleagues at the Villa Medici, under their benevolent principal Horace Vernet, made him welcome,Barzun, p. 113 and he enjoyed his meetings with Felix Mendelssohn, who was visiting the city, but he found Rome distasteful: \\"the most stupid and prosaic city I know; it is no place for anyone with head or heart.\\" Nonetheless, Italy had an important influence on his development. He visited many parts of it during his residency in Rome. Macdonald comments that after his time there, Berlioz had \\"a new colour and glow in his music ... sensuous and vivacious\\" ‚Äì derived not from Italian painting, in which he was uninterested, or Italian music, which he despised, but from \\"the scenery and the sun, and from his acute sense of locale\\". Macdonald identifies Harold in Italy, Benvenuto Cellini and Rom√©o et Juliette as the most obvious expressions of his response to Italy, and adds that Les Troyens and B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict \\"reflect the warmth and stillness of the Mediterranean, as well as its vivacity and force\\". Berlioz himself wrote that Harold in Italy drew on \\"the poetic memories formed from my wanderings in Abruzzi\\".Berlioz, p. 225 Vernet agreed to Berlioz's request to be allowed to leave the Villa Medici before the end of his two-year term. Heeding Vernet's advice that it would be prudent to delay his return to Paris, where the Conservatoire authorities might be less indulgent about his premature ending of his studies, he made a leisurely journey back, detouring via La C√¥te-Saint-Andr√© to see his family. He left Rome in May 1832 and arrived in Paris in November.Barzun, p. 125; and Evans, p. 28 =1832‚Äì1840: Paris= On 9 December 1832 Berlioz presented a concert of his works at the Conservatoire. The programme included the overture of Les Francs-juges, the Symphonie fantastique ‚Äì extensively revised since its premiere ‚Äì and Le Retour √† la vie, in which Bocage, a popular actor, declaimed the monologues. Through a third party, Berlioz had sent an invitation to Harriet Smithson, who accepted, and was dazzled by the celebrities in the audience. Among the musicians present were Liszt, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Niccol√≤ Paganini; writers included Alexandre Dumas, Th√©ophile Gautier, Heinrich Heine, Victor Hugo and George Sand.Cairns (2000), p. 557 The concert was such a success that the programme was repeated within the month, but the more immediate consequence was that Berlioz and Smithson finally met.Evans, pp. 28‚Äì29 By 1832 Smithson's career was in decline. She presented a ruinously unsuccessful season, first at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien and then at lesser venues, and by March 1833 she was deep in debt. Biographers differ about whether and to what extent Smithson's receptiveness to Berlioz's wooing was motivated by financial considerations; but she accepted him, and in the face of strong opposition from both their families they were married at the British Embassy in Paris on 3 October 1833. The couple lived first in Paris, and later in Montmartre (then still a village). On 14 August 1834 their only child, Louis- Cl√©ment-Thomas, was born. The first few years of the marriage were happy, although it eventually foundered. Harriet continued to yearn for a career but, as her biographer Peter Raby comments, she never learned to speak French fluently, which seriously limited both her professional and her social life.Raby, Peter. \\"Smithson (married name Berlioz), Harriet Constance (1800‚Äì1854), actress\\" , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2008. Retrieved 19 October 2018. Ingres Paganini, known chiefly as a violinist, had acquired a Stradivarius viola, which he wanted to play in public if he could find the right music. Greatly impressed by the Symphonie fantastique, he asked Berlioz to write him a suitable piece.Berlioz, p. 224 Berlioz told him that he could not write a brilliantly virtuoso work, and began composing what he called a symphony with viola obbligato, Harold in Italy. As he foresaw, Paganini found the solo part too reticent ‚Äì \\"There's not enough for me to do here; I should be playing all the time\\" ‚Äì and the violist at the premiere in November 1834 was Chr√©tien Urhan.Holoman (1989), p. 161 Until the end of 1835 Berlioz had a modest stipend as a laureate of the Prix de Rome. His earnings from composing were neither substantial nor regular, and he supplemented them by writing music criticism for the Parisian press. Macdonald comments that this was activity \\"at which he excelled but which he abhorred\\". He wrote for L'Europe litt√©raire (1833), Le R√©novateur (1833‚Äì1835), and from 1834 for the Gazette musicale and the Journal des d√©bats. He was the first, but not the last, prominent French composer to double as a reviewer: among his successors were Faur√©, Messager, Dukas and Debussy.Nectoux, Jean- Michel. \\"Faur√©, Gabriel (Urbain)\\"; Wagstaff, John, and Andrew Lamb. \\"Messager, Andr√©\\" ; Schwartz, Manuela and G.

Although he complained ‚Äì both privately and sometimes in his articles ‚Äì that his time would be better spent writing music than in writing music criticism, he was able to indulge himself in attacking his b√™tes noires and extolling his enthusiasms. The former included musical pedants, coloratura writing and singing, viola players who were merely incompetent violinists, inane libretti, and baroque counterpoint.Wright Roberts (I), pp. 65, 69 and 71 He extravagantly praised Beethoven's symphonies, and Gluck's and Weber's operas, and scrupulously refrained from promoting his own compositions.Wright Roberts (II), pp. 138 and 140 His journalism consisted mainly of music criticism, some of which he collected and published, such as Evenings in the Orchestra (1854), but also more technical articles, such as those that formed the basis of his Treatise on Instrumentation (1844). Despite his complaints, Berlioz continued writing music criticism for most of his life, long after he had any financial need to do so.Murphy, p. 111 Berlioz secured a commission from the French government for his Requiem ‚Äì the Grande messe des morts ‚Äì first performed at Les Invalides in December 1837. A second government commission followed ‚Äì the Grande symphonie fun√®bre et triomphale in 1840. Neither work brought him much money or artistic fame at the time, but the Requiem held a special place in his affections: \\"If I were threatened with the destruction of the whole of my works save one, I would crave mercy for the Messe des morts\\".Bernard, p. 309 Poster for the premiere of Benvenuto Cellini, September 1838. Berlioz's name is not mentioned. One of Berlioz's main aims in the 1830s was \\"battering down the doors of the Op√©ra\\".Holoman, D. Kern \\"Berlioz, (Louis-)Hector (opera)\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 1992. Retrieved 18 October 2018. In Paris at this period, the musical success that mattered was in the opera house and not the concert hall.Evans, p. 31 Robert Schumann commented, \\"To the French, music by itself means nothing\\".Cairns (1966), p. 211 Berlioz worked on his opera Benvenuto Cellini from 1834 until 1837, continually distracted by his increasing activities as a critic and as a promoter of his own symphonic concerts. The Berlioz scholar D. Kern Holoman comments that Berlioz rightly regarded Benvenuto Cellini as a work of exceptional exuberance and verve, deserving a better reception than it received. Holoman adds that the piece was of \\"surpassing technical difficulty\\", and that the singers were not especially co-operative. A weak libretto and unsatisfactory staging exacerbated the poor reception. The opera had only four complete performances, three in September 1838 and one in January 1839. Berlioz said that the failure of the piece meant that the doors of the Op√©ra were closed to him for the rest of his career ‚Äì which they were, except for a commission to arrange a Weber score in 1841.Macdonald (1969), p. 44 Shortly after the failure of the opera, Berlioz had a great success as composer-conductor of a concert at which Harold in Italy was given again. This time Paganini was present in the audience; he came on to the platform at the end and knelt in homage to Berlioz and kissed his hand.Cairns (1999), pp. 172‚Äì173 A few days later Berlioz was astonished to receive a cheque from him for 20,000 francs.Holoman (1989), p. 197 Paganini's gift enabled Berlioz to pay off Harriet's and his own debts, give up music criticism for the time being, and concentrate on composition. He wrote the \\"dramatic symphony\\" Rom√©o et Juliette for voices, chorus and orchestra. It was premiered in November 1839 and was so well received that Berlioz and his huge instrumental and vocal forces gave two further performances in rapid succession.Evans, p. 32 Among the audiences was the young Wagner, who was overwhelmed by its revelation of the possibilities of musical poetry,Cairns (1999), p. 205 and who later drew on it when composing Tristan und Isolde.Barzun, p. 188 At the close of the decade Berlioz achieved official recognition in the form of appointment as deputy librarian of the Conservatoire and as an officer of the Legion of Honour.Bloom (2000), p. xvii The former was an undemanding post, but not highly paid, and Berlioz remained in need of a reliable income to allow him the leisure for composition.Cairns (1999), p. 177 = 1840s: Struggling composer = alt=head and shoulders of middle-aged white man, with dark bushy hair; clean-shaven except for neat side-whiskers The Symphonie fun√®bre et triomphale, marking the tenth anniversary of the 1830 Revolution, was performed in the open air under the direction of the composer in July 1840. The following year the Op√©ra commissioned Berlioz to adapt Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz to meet the house's rigid requirements: he wrote recitatives to replace the spoken dialogue and orchestrated Weber's Invitation to the Dance to provide the obligatory ballet music.Bloom (2000), p. xviii In the same year he completed settings of six poems by his friend Th√©ophile Gautier, which formed the song cycle Les Nuits d'√©t√© (with piano accompaniment, later orchestrated).Rushton (2001), p. 165 He also worked on a projected opera, La Nonne sanglante (The Bloody Nun), to a libretto by Eug√®ne Scribe, but made little progress.Cairns (1999), pp. 241‚Äì242 In November 1841 he began publishing a series of sixteen articles in the Revue et gazette musicale giving his views about orchestration; they were the basis of his Treatise on Instrumentation, published in 1843.Cairns (1999), p. 235; and Holoman (1989), p. 282 During the 1840s Berlioz spent much of his time making music outside France. He struggled to make money from his concerts in Paris, and learning of the large sums made by promoters from performances of his music in other countries, he resolved to try conducting abroad.Cairns (1999), p. 259 He began in Brussels, giving two concerts in September 1842. An extensive German tour followed: in 1842 and 1843 he gave concerts in twelve German cities. His reception was enthusiastic. The German public was better disposed than the French to his innovative compositions, and his conducting was seen as highly impressive. During the tour he had enjoyable meetings with Mendelssohn and Schumann in Leipzig, Wagner in Dresden and Meyerbeer in Berlin.Holoman (1989), pp. 292, 296‚Äì297 and 300 Marie Recio, later Berlioz's second wife By this time Berlioz's marriage was failing. Harriet resented his celebrity and her own eclipse, and as Raby puts it, \\"possessiveness turned to suspicion and jealousy as Berlioz became involved with the singer Marie Recio\\". Harriet's health deteriorated, and she took to drinking heavily. Her suspicion about Recio was well founded: the latter became Berlioz's mistress in 1841 and accompanied him on his German tour.Evans, p. 29; and Holoman (1989), p. 288 Berlioz returned to Paris in mid-1843. During the following year he wrote two of his most popular short works, the overtures Le carnaval romain (reusing music from Benvenuto Cellini) and Le corsaire (originally called La tour de Nice). Towards the end of the year he and Harriet separated. Berlioz maintained two households: Harriet remained in Montmartre and he moved in with Recio at her flat in central Paris. His son Louis was sent to a boarding school in Rouen.Holoman (1989), p. 313 Foreign tours featured prominently in Berlioz's life during the 1840s and 1850s. Not only were they highly rewarding both artistically and financially, but he did not have to grapple with the administrative problems of promoting concerts in Paris. Macdonald comments: Berlioz's major work from the decade was La Damnation de Faust. He presented it in Paris in December 1846, but it played to half-empty houses, despite excellent reviews, some from critics not usually well disposed to his music. The highly romantic subject was out of step with the times, and one sympathetic reviewer observed that there was an unbridgeable gap between the composer's conception of art and that of the Paris public.Cairns (1999), pp. 363‚Äì364 The failure of the piece left Berlioz heavily in debt; he restored his finances the following year with the first of two highly remunerative trips to Russia. His other foreign tours during the rest of the 1840s included Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Germany.Bloom (2000), pp. xviii and xix After those came the first of his five visits to England; it lasted for more than seven months (November 1847 to July 1848). His reception in London was enthusiastic, but the visit was not a financial success because of mismanagement by his impresario, the conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien.Evans, p. 35 Soon after Berlioz's return to Paris in mid-September 1848, Harriet suffered a series of strokes, which left her almost paralysed. She needed constant nursing, which he paid for.Cairns (1999), pp. 440‚Äì441 When in Paris he visited her continually, sometimes twice a day.Cairns (1999), p. 441 =1850s: International success= Berlioz by alt=oil painting of middle-aged man in right semi-profile, looking towards the artist After the failure of La Damnation de Faust, Berlioz spent less time on composition during the next eight years. He wrote a Te Deum, completed in 1849 but not published until 1855, and some short pieces. His most substantial work between The Damnation and his epic Les Troyens (1856‚Äì1858) was a \\"sacred trilogy\\", L'Enfance du Christ (Christ's Childhood), which he began in 1850.Rushton (1983), pp. 288‚Äì290 In 1851 he was at the Great Exhibition in London as a member of an international committee judging musical instruments.Holoman (1989), p. 425 He returned to London in 1852 and 1853, conducting his own works and others'. He enjoyed consistent success there, with the exception of a revival of Benvenuto Cellini at Covent Garden which was withdrawn after one performance.Holoman (1989), p. 445 The opera was presented in Leipzig in 1852 in a revised version prepared by Liszt with Berlioz's approval and was moderately successful.Barzun, p. 285 In the early years of the decade Berlioz made numerous appearances in Germany as a conductor.Holoman (1989), pp. 447‚Äì449, 450‚Äì453, and 457‚Äì460 In 1854 Harriet died.Bloom (2000), p. xx Both Berlioz and their son Louis had been with her shortly before her death.Cairns (1999), p. 528 During the year Berlioz completed the composition of L'Enfance du Christ, worked on his book of memoirs, and married Marie Recio, which, he explained to his son, he felt it his duty to do after living with her for so many years.Cairns (1999), pp. 540 and 546 At the end of the year the first performance of L'Enfance du Christ was warmly received, to his surprise.Cairns (1999), pp. 549‚Äì551 He spent much of the next year in conducting and writing prose. During Berlioz's German tour in 1856, Liszt and his companion, Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, encouraged Berlioz's tentative conception of an opera based on the Aeneid.Cairns (1999), p. 557 Having first completed the orchestration of his 1841 song cycle Les Nuits d'√©t√©,Cairns (2006), p. 4 he began work on Les Troyens ‚Äì The Trojans ‚Äì writing his own libretto based on Virgil's epic. He worked on it, in between his conducting commitments, for two years. In 1858 he was elected to the Institut de France, an honour he had long sought, though he played down the importance he attached to it.Bloom (1981), p. 194 In the same year he completed Les Troyens. He then spent five years trying to have it staged.Bloom (2000), pp. xxi‚Äìxxii =1860‚Äì1869: Final years= Pierre Petit, 1863 Montmartre In June 1862 Berlioz's wife died suddenly, aged 48. She was survived by her mother, to whom Berlioz was devoted, and who looked after him for the rest of his life.Holoman (1989), p. 505 Les Troyens ‚Äì a five-act, five-hour opera ‚Äì was on too large a scale to be acceptable to the management of the Op√©ra, and Berlioz's efforts to have it staged there failed. The only way he could find of seeing the work produced was to divide it into two parts: \\"The Fall of Troy\\" and \\"The Trojans at Carthage\\". The latter, consisting of the final three acts of the original, was presented at the Th√©√¢tre‚ÄêLyrique, Paris, in November 1863, but even that truncated version was further truncated: during the run of 22 performances, number after number was cut. The experience demoralised Berlioz, who wrote no more music after this.Holoman, D. Kern. \\"Troyens, Les\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2002. Retrieved 19 October 2018. Berlioz did not seek a revival of Les Troyens and none took place for nearly 30 years. He sold the publishing rights for a large sum, and his last years were financially comfortable;Holoman (1989), p. 563 he was able to give up his work as a critic, but he lapsed into depression. As well as losing both his wives, he had lost both his sisters, and he became morbidly aware of death as many of his friends and other contemporaries died. He and his son had grown deeply attached to each other, but Louis was a captain in the merchant navy, and was more often than not away from home.Cairns (1999), pp. 732‚Äì733 Berlioz's physical health was not good, and he was often in pain from an intestinal complaint, possibly Crohn's disease.O'Neal (2018), p. 181 After the death of his second wife, Berlioz had two romantic interludes. During 1862 he met ‚Äì probably in the Montmartre Cemetery ‚Äì a young woman less than half his age, whose first name was Am√©lie and whose second, possibly married, name is not recorded. Almost nothing is known of their relationship, which lasted for less than a year.Cairns (1999), pp. 683‚Äì685 After they ceased to meet, Am√©lie died, aged only 26. Berlioz was unaware of it until he came across her grave six months later. Cairns hypothesises that the shock of her death prompted him to seek out his first love, Estelle, now a widow aged 67.Cairns (1999), p. 722 He called on her in September 1864; she received him kindly, and he visited her in three successive summers; he wrote to her nearly every month for the rest of his life. In 1867 Berlioz received the news that his son had died in Havana of yellow fever. Macdonald suggests that Berlioz may have sought distraction from his grief by going ahead with a planned series of concerts in St Petersburg and Moscow, but far from rejuvenating him, the trip sapped his remaining strength. The concerts were successful, and Berlioz received a warm response from the new generation of Russian composers and the general public, but he returned to Paris visibly unwell.Barzun, p. 407 He went to Nice to recuperate in the Mediterranean climate, but fell on rocks by the shore, possibly because of a stroke, and had to return to Paris, where he convalesced for several months. In August 1868, he felt able to travel briefly to Grenoble to judge a choral festival.Barzun, p. 410 After arriving back in Paris he gradually grew weaker and died at his house in the Rue de Calais on 8 March 1869, at the age of 65.Holoman (1989), p. 592 He was buried in Montmartre Cemetery with his two wives, who were exhumed and re-buried next to him.Holoman (1989), p. 594 Works In his 1983 book The Musical Language of Berlioz, Julian Rushton asks \\"where Berlioz comes in the history of musical forms and what is his progeny\\". Rushton's answers to these questions are \\"nowhere\\" and \\"none\\".Rushton (1983), p. 257 He cites well-known studies of musical history in which Berlioz is mentioned only in passing or not at all, and suggests that this is partly because Berlioz had no models among his predecessors and was a model to none of his successors. \\"In his works, as in his life, Berlioz was a lone wolf\\".Rushton (1983), p. 258 Forty years earlier, Sir Thomas Beecham, a lifelong proponent of Berlioz's music, commented similarly, writing that although, for example, Mozart was a greater composer, his music drew on the works of his predecessors, whereas Berlioz's works were all wholly original: \\"the Symphonie fantastique or La Damnation de Faust broke upon the world like some unaccountable effort of spontaneous generation which had dispensed with the machinery of normal parentage\\".Beecham, p. 183 alt=musical score Rushton suggests that \\"Berlioz's way is neither architectural nor developmental, but illustrative\\". He judges this to be part of a continuing French musical aesthetic, favouring a \\"decorative\\" ‚Äì rather than the German \\"architectural\\" ‚Äì approach to composition. Abstraction and discursiveness are alien to this tradition, and in operas, and to a large extent in orchestral music, there is little continuous development; instead self-contained numbers or sections are preferred.Rushton (1983), pp. 259‚Äì261 Berlioz's compositional techniques have been strongly criticised and equally strongly defended.Cairns (1963), pp. 548 and 550 It is common ground for critics and defenders that his approach to harmony and musical structure conforms to no established rules; his detractors ascribe this to ignorance, and his proponents to independent-minded adventurousness.Rosen, Charles. \\"Battle over Berlioz\\" , New York Review of Books, 26 April 1984. Retrieved 19 October 2018.Rushton (1983), p. 182 His approach to rhythm caused perplexity to conservatively-inclined contemporaries; he hated the phrase carr√©e ‚Äì the unvaried four- or eight-bar phrase ‚Äì and introduced new varieties of rhythm to his music. He explained his practice in an 1837 article: accenting weak beats at the expense of the strong, alternating triple and duple groups of notes and using unexpected rhythmic themes independent of the main melody.Holoman (1989), p. 169; and Rushton (1983) pp. 127‚Äì128 Macdonald writes that Berlioz was a natural melodist, but that his rhythmic sense led him away from regular phrase lengths; he \\"spoke naturally in a kind of flexible musical prose, with surprise and contour important elements\\". Berlioz's approach to harmony and counterpoint was idiosyncratic, and has provoked adverse criticism. Pierre Boulez commented, \\"There are awkward harmonies in Berlioz that make one scream\\".Rosen (1998), p. 544 In Rushton's analysis, most of Berlioz's melodies have \\"clear tonal and harmonic implications\\" but the composer sometimes chose not to harmonise accordingly. Rushton observes that Berlioz's preference for irregular rhythm subverts conventional harmony: \\"Classic and romantic melody usually implies harmonic motion of some consistency and smoothness; Berlioz's aspiration to musical prose tends to resist such consistency.\\"Rushton (1983), p. 145 The pianist and musical analyst Charles Rosen has written that Berlioz often sets the climax of his melodies in relief with the most emphatic chord a triad in root position, and often a tonic chord where the melody leads the listener to expect a dominant. He gives as an example the second phrase of the main theme ‚Äì the id√©e fixe ‚Äì of the Symphonie fantastique, \\"famous for its shock to classical sensibilities\\", in which the melody implies a dominant at its climax resolved by a tonic, but in which Berlioz anticipates the resolution by putting a tonic under the climactic note. Berlioz's use of col legno strings in the Symphonie fantastique: the players tap their strings with the wooden backs of their bows Even among those unsympathetic to his music, few deny that Berlioz was a master of orchestration.Macdonald (1969), p. 255 Richard Strauss wrote that Berlioz invented the modern orchestra. Some of those who recognise Berlioz's mastery of orchestration nonetheless dislike a few of his more extreme effects. The pedal point for trombones in the \\"Hostias\\" section of the Requiem is often cited; some musicians such as Gordon Jacob have found the effect unpleasant. Macdonald has questioned Berlioz's fondness for divided cellos and basses in dense, low chords, but he emphasises that such contentious points are rare compared with \\"the felicities and masterstrokes\\" abounding in the scores.Macdonald (1969), pp. 256‚Äì257 Berlioz took instruments hitherto used for special purposes and introduced them into his regular orchestra: Macdonald mentions the harp, the cor anglais, the bass clarinet and the valve trumpet. Among the characteristic touches in Berlioz's orchestration singled out by Macdonald are the wind \\"chattering on repeated notes\\" for brilliance, or being used to add \\"sombre colour\\" to Romeo's arrival at the Capulets' vault, and the \\"Ch≈ìur d'ombres\\" in L√©lio. Of Berlioz's brass he writes: =Symphonies= Berlioz wrote four large-scale works he called symphonies, but his conception of the genre differed greatly from the classical pattern of the German tradition. With rare exceptions, such as Beethoven's Ninth, a symphony was taken to be a large‚Äêscale wholly orchestral work, usually in four movements, using sonata form in the first movement and sometimes in others.Kennedy, Michael, and Joyce Bourne Kennedy. \\"Symphony\\" , The Oxford Dictionary of Music, Oxford University Press, 2013. Retrieved 19 October 2018. Some pictorial touches were included in symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and others, but the symphony was not customarily used to recount a narrative. Id√©e fixe theme, Symphonie fantastique All four of Berlioz's symphonies differ from the contemporary norm. The first, the Symphonie fantastique (1830), is purely orchestral, and the opening movement is broadly in sonata form,Rushton (1983), pp. 182 and 190‚Äì191 but the work tells a story, graphically and specifically.Service, Tom. \\"Symphony guide: Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique\\" , The Guardian, 19 August 2014.

The recurring id√©e fixe theme is the composer's idealised (and in the last movement caricatured) portrait of Harriet Smithson.Cairns (1999), p. 559; and Holoman (1989), p. 107 Schumann wrote of the work that despite its apparent formlessness, \\"there is an inherent symmetrical order corresponding to the great dimensions of the work, and this besides the inner connexions of thought\\",Quoted in Cairns (1966), p. 209 and in the 20th century Constant Lambert wrote, \\"Formally speaking it is among the finest of 19th-century symphonies\\". The work has always been among Berlioz's most popular.Macdonald (1969), p. 30 Harold in Italy, despite its subtitle \\"Symphony in four parts with viola principal\\", is described by the musicologist Mark Evan Bonds as a work traditionally seen as lacking any direct historical antecedent, \\"a hybrid of symphony and concerto that owes little or nothing to the earlier, lighter genre of the symphonie concertante\\".Bonds, p. 417 In the 20th century critical opinion varied about the work, even among those well-disposed to Berlioz. Felix Weingartner, an early 20th century champion of the composer, wrote in 1904 that it did not reach the level of the Symphonie fantastique;Weingartner, p. 67 fifty years later Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor found it \\"romantic and picturesque ... Berlioz at his best\\".Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 121 In the 21st century Bonds ranks it among the greatest works of its kind in the 19th century.Bonds, p. 408 The \\"Dramatic Symphony\\" with chorus, Rom√©o et Juliette (1839), is still further from the traditional symphonic model. The episodes of Shakespeare's drama are represented in orchestral music, interspersed with expository and narrative sections for voices.Rushton (2001), p. 42 Among Berlioz's admirers the work divides opinion. Weingartner called it \\"a style-less mixture of different forms; not quite oratorio, not quite opera, not quite symphony ‚Äì fragments of all three, and nothing perfect\\".Weingartner, p. 68 Countering accusations of lack of unity in this and other Berlioz works Emmanuel Chabrier replied in a single emphatic word. Cairns regards the work as symphonic, albeit \\"a bold extension\\" of the genre, but he notes that other Berliozians including Wilfrid Mellers view it as \\"a curious, not entirely convincing compromise between symphonic and operatic techniques\\".Cairns (1966), pp. 223‚Äì224 Rushton comments that \\"pronounced unity\\" is not among the virtues of the work, but he argues that to close one's mind on that account is to miss all that the music has to give.Rushton (1983), p. 262 The last of the four symphonies is the Symphonie funebre et triomphale, for giant brass and woodwind band (1840), with string parts added later, together with optional chorus. The structure is more conventional than the instrumentation: the first movement is in sonata form, but there are only two other movements, and Berlioz did not adhere to the traditional relationship between the various keys of the piece.Rushton (1983), p. 256 Wagner called the symphony \\"popular in the most ideal sense ... every urchin in a blue blouse would thoroughly understand it\\".Quoted in Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 121 =Operas= Les Troyens √† Carthage (the second part of Les Troyens) at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra-Comique-Ch√¢telet, 1892alt=Theatre poster showing figures in classical dress on a beach with a seascape in the background and a burning city in the foreground None of Berlioz's three completed operas were written to commission, and theatre managers were not enthusiastic about staging them. Cairns writes that unlike Meyerbeer, who was rich, influential, and deferred to by opera managements, Berlioz was \\"an opera composer on sufferance, one who composed on borrowed time paid for with money that was not his but lent by a wealthy friend\\".Cairns (1999), p. 111 The three operas contrast strongly with one another. The first, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), inspired by the memoirs of the Florentine sculptor, is an opera semiseria, seldom staged until the 21st century, when there have been signs of a revival in its fortunes, with its first production at the Metropolitan Opera (2003) and a co-production by the English National Opera and the Op√©ra national de Paris (2014), but it remains the least often produced of the three operas.\\"Statistics: Works by Berlioz\\" , Operabase. Retrieved 9 October 2018 In 2008, the music critic Michael Quinn called it \\"an opera overflowing in every way, with musical gold bursting from each curve and crevice ... a score of continually stupendous brilliance and invention\\" but agreed with the general view of the libretto: \\"incoherent ... episodic, too epic to be comedy, too ironic for tragedy\\".Quinn, Michael. \\"Berlioz, Benvenuto Cellini\\", Gramophone, 2008 . Retrieved 19 October 2018. Berlioz welcomed Liszt's help in revising the work, streamlining the confusing plot; for his other two operas he wrote his own libretti.O'Neal (2018), p. 235 The epic Les Troyens (1858) is described by the musical scholar James Haar as \\"incontestably Berlioz's masterpiece\\",Haar, p. 92 a view shared by many other writers. Berlioz based the text on Virgil's Aeneid, depicting the fall of Troy and subsequent travels of the hero. Holoman describes the poetry of the libretto as old fashioned for its day, but effective and at times beautiful. The opera consists of a series of self-contained numbers, but they form a continuous narrative, with the orchestra playing a vital part in expounding and commenting on the action. Although the work plays for five hours (including intervals) it is no longer the normal practice to present it across two evenings. Les Troyens, in Holoman's view, embodies the composer's artistic creed: the union of music and poetry holds \\"incomparably greater power than either art alone\\". The last of Berlioz's operas is the Shakespearean comedy B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict (1862), written, the composer said, as a relaxation after his efforts with Les Troyens. He described it as \\"a caprice written with the point of a needle\\". His libretto, based on Much Ado About Nothing, omits Shakespeare's darker sub-plots and replaces the clowns Dogberry and Verges with an invention of his own, the tiresome and pompous music master Somarone.Rushton (1982‚Äì1983), pp. 106 and 108 The action focuses on the sparring between the two leading characters, but the score contains some gentler music, such as the nocturne-duet \\"Nuit paisible et sereine\\", the beauty of which, Cairns suggests, matches or surpasses the love music in Rom√©o or Les Troyens.Cairns, David. \\"Opera: The Berlioz Question\\" , The Spectator, 19 February 1960, p. 16.

La Damnation de Faust, although not written for the theatre, is sometimes staged as an opera.Haar, p. 89 =Choral= Berlioz's manuscript of the Requiem, showing the eight pairs of timpani in the Dies irae Berlioz gained a reputation, only partly justified, for liking gigantic orchestral and choral forces. In France there was a tradition of open-air performance, dating from the Revolution, calling for larger ensembles than were needed in the concert hall.Boyd, p. 235 Among the generation of French composers ahead of him, Cherubini, M√©hul, Gossec and Berlioz's teacher Le Sueur all wrote for huge forces on occasion, and in the Requiem and to a lesser degree the Te Deum Berlioz follows them, in his own manner. The Requiem calls for sixteen timpani, quadruple woodwind and twelve horns, but the moments when the full orchestral sound is unleashed are few ‚Äì the Dies irae is one such ‚Äì and most of the Requiem is notable for its restraint.Anderson, Martin. \\"The Proms raises the titanic\\" , The Independent, 21 July 2000.

Notes to LSO Live CD set LSO0729D What Macdonald calls Berlioz's monumental manner is more prominent in the Te Deum, composed in 1849 and first heard in 1855, when it was given in connection with the Exposition Universelle. By that time the composer had added to its two choruses a part for massed children's voices, inspired by hearing a choir of 6,500 children singing in St Paul's Cathedral during his London trip in 1851. A cantata for double chorus and large orchestra in honour of Napoleon III, L'Imp√©riale, described by Berlioz as \\"en style √©norme\\", was played several times at the 1855 exhibition, but has subsequently remained a rarity.Rushton (2008), p. 51 La Damnation de Faust, though conceived as a work for the concert hall, did not achieve success in France until it was staged as an opera long after the composer's death.

Retrieved 19 October 2018. L'Enfance du Christ (1850‚Äì1854) follows the pattern of La Damnation de Faust in mixing dramatic action and philosophic reflection. Berlioz, after a brief youthful religious spell, was a lifelong agnostic,Cairns (2000), pp. 94 and 552 but he was not hostile to the Roman Catholic church,Berlioz, p. 31 and Macdonald calls the \\"serenely contemplative\\" end of the work \\"the nearest Berlioz ever came to a devoutly Christian mode of expression\\". =M√©lodies= Berlioz wrote songs throughout his career, but not prolifically. His best-known work in the genre is the song cycle Les Nuits d'√©t√©, a group of six songs, originally for voice and piano but now usually heard in its later orchestrated form. He suppressed some of his early songs, and his last publication, in 1865, was the 33 M√©lodies, collecting into one volume all his songs that he chose to preserve. Some of them, such as \\"H√©l√®ne\\" and \\"Sara la baigneuse\\", exist in versions for four voices with accompaniment, and there are others for two or three voices. Berlioz later orchestrated some of the songs originally written with piano accompaniment, and some, such as \\"Za√Øde\\" and \\"Le Chasseur danois\\" were written with alternative piano or orchestral parts. \\"La Captive\\", to words by Victor Hugo, exists in six different versions. In its final version (1849) it was described by the Berlioz scholar Tom S. Wotton as like \\"a miniature symphonic poem\\".Rushton (2001), p. 53 The first version, written at the Villa Medici, had been in fairly regular rhythm, but for his revision Berlioz made the strophic outline less clear-cut, and added optional orchestral parts for the last stanza, which brings the song to a quiet close.Rushton (2001), pp. 53‚Äì54; and Holoman (1898), p. 242 The songs remain on the whole among the least known of Berlioz's works, and John Warrack suggests that Schumann identified why this might be so: the shape of the melodies is, as usual with Berlioz, not straightforward, and to those used to the regular four-bar phrases of French (or German) song this is an obstacle to appreciation. Warrack also comments that the piano parts, though not lacking in harmonic interest, are discernibly written by a non-pianist. Despite that, Warrack considers up to a dozen songs from the 33 M√©lodies well worth exploring ‚Äì \\"Among them are some masterpieces.\\"Warrack, pp. 252 and 254 =Prose= Berlioz's literary output was considerable and mostly consists of music criticism. Some was collected and published in book form. His Treatise on Instrumentation (1834) began as a series of articles and remained a standard work on orchestration throughout the 19th century; when Richard Strauss was commissioned to revise it in 1905 he added new material but did not change Berlioz's original text.Lockspeiser, pp. 37‚Äì38 The revised form remained widely used well into the 20th century; a new English translation was published in 1948.Lockspeiser, pp. 42 and 44 Other selections from Berlioz's press columns were published in Les Soir√©es de l'orchestre (Nights with the Orchestra, 1852), Les Grotesques de la musique (1859) and √Ä travers chants (Through Songs, 1862). His M√©moires were published posthumously in 1870. Macdonald comments that there are few facets of musical practice of the time untouched in Berlioz's feuilletons. He professed to dislike writing his press pieces, and they undoubtedly took up time that he would have preferred to spend writing music. His excellence as a witty and perceptive critic may have worked to his disadvantage in another way: he became so well known to the French public in that capacity that his stature as a composer became correspondingly more difficult to establish. Reputation and Berlioz scholarship =Writers= The first biography of Berlioz, by Eug√®ne de Mirecourt, was published during the composer's lifetime. Holoman lists six other French biographies of the composer published in the four decades after his death.Holoman (1989), p. 633 Of those who wrote for and against Berlioz's music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, among the most outspoken were musical amateurs such as the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong, who called the composer's music variously \\"flatulent\\", \\"rubbish\\", and \\"the work of a tipsy chimpanzee\\",Barzun, p. 12 and, in the pro- Berlioz camp, the poet and journalist Walter J. Turner, who wrote what Cairns calls \\"exaggerated eulogies\\".Cairns (1963), p. 548 Like Strong, Turner was, in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, \\"unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge\\".Reid, p. 189 Serious studies of Berlioz in the 20th century began with Adolphe Boschot's L'Histoire d'un romantique (three volumes, 1906‚Äì1913). His successors were Tom S. Wotton, author of a 1935 biography, and Julien Tiersot, who wrote numerous scholarly articles on Berlioz and began the collection and editing of the composer's letters, a process eventually completed in 2016, eighty years after Tiersot's death.Holoman (1975), pp. 57‚Äì58 In the early 1950s the best-known Berlioz scholar was Jacques Barzun, a prot√©g√© of Wotton, and, like him, strongly hostile to many of Boschot's conclusions, which they saw as unfairly critical of the composer. Barzun's study was published in 1950. He was accused at the time by the musicologist Winton Dean of being excessively partisan, and refusing to admit failings and unevenness in Berlioz's music;Dean, pp. 122‚Äì123 and 128‚Äì129 more recently he has been credited by the critic Nicholas Temperley with playing a major part in improving the climate of musical opinion towards Berlioz.Holoman (1975), p. 59 Since Barzun, the leading Berlioz scholars have included David Cairns, D. Kern Holoman, Hugh Macdonald and Julian Rushton. Cairns translated and edited Berlioz's M√©moires in 1969, and published a two-volume, 1500-page study of the composer (1989 and 1999), described in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians as \\"one of the masterpieces of modern biography\\".Sadie, Stanley. \\"Cairns, David\\" , Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, 2001.

Retrieved 19 October 2018. =Changing reputation= Because few of Berlioz's works were often performed in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, widely accepted views of his music were based on hearsay rather than on the music itself.Barzun, pp. 11‚Äì13 Orthodox opinion emphasised supposed technical defects in the music and ascribed to the composer characteristics that he did not possess. Debussy called him \\"a monster ... not a musician at all. He creates the illusion of music by means borrowed from literature and painting\\".Sorrell, p. 63 In 1904, in the second edition of Grove, Henry Hadow made this judgment: By the 1950s the critical climate was changing, although in 1954 the fifth edition of Grove carried this verdict from L√©on Vallas: Cairns dismisses the article as \\"an astonishing anthology of all the nonsense that has ever been talked about [Berlioz]\\", but adds that by the 1960s it seemed a quaint survival from a vanished age. By 1963 Cairns, viewing Berlioz's greatness as firmly established, felt able to advise anyone writing on the subject, \\"Do not keep harping on the 'strangeness' of Berlioz's music; you will no longer carry the reader with you. And do not use phrases like 'genius without talent', 'a certain strain of amateurishness', 'curiously uneven': they have had their day.\\" One important reason for the steep rise in Berlioz's reputation and popularity is the introduction of the LP record after the Second World War. In 1950 Barzun made the point that although Berlioz was praised by his artistic peers, including Schumann, Wagner, Franck and Mussorgsky, the public had heard little of his music until recordings became widely available. Barzun maintained that many myths had grown up about the supposed quirkiness or ineptitude of the music ‚Äì myths that were dispelled once the works were finally made available for all to hear. Neville Cardus made a similar point in 1955.Cardus, Neville. \\"A Note on Berlioz\\", The Manchester Guardian, 31 October 1955, p. 5 As more and more Berlioz works became widely available on record, professional musicians and critics, and the musical public, were for the first time able to judge for themselves. A milestone in the reappraisal of Berlioz's reputation came in 1957, when for the first time a professional opera company staged the original version of The Trojans in a single evening. It was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; the work was sung in English with some minor cuts, but its importance was internationally recognised, and led to the world premiere staging of the work uncut and in French, at Covent Garden in 1969, marking the centenary of the composer's death.Hudson, p. 678 In recent decades Berlioz has been widely regarded as a great composer, prone to lapses like any other. In 1999 the composer and critic Bayan Northcott wrote that the work of Cairns, Rushton, Sir Colin Davis and others retained \\"the embattled conviction of a cause\\". Nevertheless, Northcott was writing about Davis's \\"Berlioz Odyssey\\" of seventeen concerts of Berlioz's music, featuring all the major works, a prospect unimaginable in earlier decades of the century.Allison, John. \\"Davis and the LSO embark on their year-long journey through Berlioz\\", The Times, 7 December 1999, p. 41 Northcott concluded, \\"Berlioz still seems so immediate, so controversial, so ever-new\\".Northcott, Bayan. \\"Still so controversial, still so new\\" , The Independent, 26 November 1999.

He was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. His career spanned the entire second half of the twentieth century, producing numerous distinctive buildings in Tokyo, other Japanese cities and cities around the world, as well as ambitious physical plans for Tokyo and its environs. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: \\"It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism\\", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism. Influenced from an early age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained international recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. He was a member of CIAM (Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne) in the 1950s. He did not join the group of younger CIAM architects known as Team X, though his 1960 Tokyo Bay plan was influential for Team 10 in the 1960s, as well as the group that became Metabolism. His university studies on urbanism put him in an ideal position to handle redevelopment projects after the Second World War. His ideas were explored in designs for Tokyo and Skopje. Tange's work influenced a generation of architects across the world. Early life Born on 4 September 1913 in Osaka, Japan, Tange spent his early life in the Chinese cities of Hankow and Shanghai; he and his family returned to Japan after learning of the death of one of his uncles. In contrast to the green lawns and red bricks in their Shanghai abode, the Tange family took up residence in a thatched roof farmhouse in Imabari on the island of Shikoku.Stewart (1987), p. 170 After finishing middle school, Tange moved to Hiroshima in 1930 to attend high school. It was here that he first encountered the works of Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier. His discovery of the drawings of the Palace of the Soviets in a foreign art journal convinced him to become an architect. Although he graduated from high school, Tange's poor results in mathematics and physics meant that he had to pass entrance exams to qualify for admission to the prestigious universities. He spent two years doing so and during that time, he read extensively about western philosophy. Tange also enrolled in the film division at Nihon University's art department to dodge Japan's drafting of young men to its military and seldom attended classes. In 1935 Tange began the tertiary studies he desired at University of Tokyo's architecture department. He studied under Hideto Kishida and Shozo Uchida. Although Tange was fascinated by the photographs of Katsura villa that sat on Kishida's desk, his work was inspired by Le Corbusier. His graduation project was a seventeen- hectare (42-acre) development set in Tokyo's Hibiya Park.Stewart (1987), p. 171 Early career After graduating from the university, Tange started to work as an architect at the office of Kunio Maekawa. During his employment, he travelled to Manchuria, participating in an architectural design competition for a bank, and toured Japanese-occupied Jehol on his return. When the Second World War started, he left Maekawa to rejoin the University of Tokyo as a postgraduate student. He developed an interest in urban design, and referencing only the resources available in the university library, he embarked on a study of Greek and Roman marketplaces. In 1942, Tange entered a competition for the design of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Memorial Hall. He was awarded first prize for a design that would have been situated at the base of Mount Fuji; the hall he conceived was a fusion of Shinto shrine architecture and the plaza on Capitoline Hill in Rome. The design was not realised.Reynolds (2001), p. 126 In 1946, Tange became an assistant professor at the university and opened Tange Laboratory. In 1963, he was promoted to professor of the Department of Urban Engineering. His students included Sachio Otani, Kisho Kurokawa, Arata Isozaki, Hajime Yatsuka and Fumihiko Maki. Post war reconstruction Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum showing axis with cenotaph and A-bomb dome (1955) Tange's interest in urban studies put him in a good position to handle post war reconstruction. In the summer of 1946 he was invited by the War Damage Rehabilitation Board to put forward a proposal for certain war damaged cities. He submitted plans for Hiroshima and Maebashi.Yorifusa (2003), p. 29 His design for an airport in Kanon, Hiroshima was accepted and built, but a seaside park in Ujina was not.Norioki (2003), p. 92 The Hiroshima authorities took advice about the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below the explosion of the atomic bomb.Norioki (2003), p. 96 In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, which gave the city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced for the design of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.Diedfendorf, Hein & Yorifusa (2003), p. 95 Tange was awarded first prize for a design that proposed a museum whose axis runs through the park, intersecting Peace Boulevard and the atomic bomb dome. The building is raised on massive columns, which frame the view along the structure's axis.Diedfendorf, Hein & Yorifusa (2003), p. 98 Projects =Centro Direzionale (Naples)= Aerial view of the Centro Direzionale. The Centro Direzionale (Naples) is a service center in Naples, Italy. The district is mainly devoted to business. The project of the Centro Direzionale dates back to 1964. It was designed in 1982 by Tange. The layout includes 18 blocks of buildings, with high-rises up to 100 meters. There are office buildings as well as residential flats. The Center is meant to accommodate most, if not all, of the administrative offices of the city of Naples, such as the new Hall of Justice. It also includes a pedestrian zone at ground level with shops, restaurants and hotels. There is an underground parking facility with escalators running up into the middle of the large pedestrian concourse, an area adorned with fountains, benches, greenery and a church. The Centro Direzionale is home to the tallest building in southern Italy, the Telecom Italia Tower. =Peace Center in Hiroshima= Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, view along axis (1955) Cenotaph, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Japan Work on the Peace Center commenced in 1950. In addition to the axial nature of the design, the layout is similar to Tange's early competition arrangement for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Memorial Hall. In the initial design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was dominated by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high- level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only one of which was subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre around the building that houses the information about the atomic explosion.Kulterman (1970), p. 17 The museum is constructed from bare reinforced concrete. The primary museum floor is lifted six metres above the ground on huge piloti and is accessible via a free-standing staircase. The rhythmical facade comprises vertical elements that repeat outwards from the centre. Like the exterior, the interior is finished with rough concrete; the idea was to keep the surfaces plain so that nothing could distract the visitor from the contents of the exhibits.Kulterman (1970), p. 18 The Peace Plaza is the backdrop for the museum. The plaza was designed to allow 50 thousand people to gather around the peace monument in the centre. Tange also designed the Cenotaph monument as an arch composed of two hyperbolic paraboloids, said to be based on traditional Japanese ceremonial tombs from the Kofun Period. =Ise Shrine= In 1953 Tange and the architectural journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe were invited to attend the reconstruction of the Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20 years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair but this time the ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided with the end of the American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.Diedfendorf, Hein & Yorifusa (2003), p. 197 =Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall= The Kagawa Prefectural Government Hall on the island of Shikoku was completed in 1958. Its expressive construction could be likened to the Daibutsu style seen at the T≈çdai-ji in Nara.Stewart (1987), p. 207 The columns on the elevation bore only vertical loads so Tange was able to design them to be thin, maximising the surfaces for glazing. Although the hall has been called one of his finest projects,Japan Architect (2005), p. 100 it drew criticism at the time of its construction for relying too heavily on tradition.Kulterman (1970), p. 56 Kenz≈ç Tange's own house (1953) =Tange's own home= Tange's own home, designed in 1951 and completed in 1953, uses a similar skeleton structure raised off the ground as the Hiroshima Peace Museum; however, it is fused with a more traditional Japanese design that uses timber and paper. The house is based on the traditional Japanese module of the tatami mat, with the largest rooms designed to have flexibility so that they can be separated into three smaller rooms by fusuma sliding doors.Kulterman (1970), p. 28 The facade is designed with a rhythmic pattern; it comprises two types of facade designs (\\"a\\" and \\"b\\") that are ordered laterally in an a-b-a- a-b-a arrangement. The house is topped with a two-tier roof. Kazuo Shinohara's 1954 house at Kugayama is remarkably similar in its design, although it is built with steel and has a simpler rhythm in its facade.Stewart (1987), p. 197 =Town Hall, Kurashiki= The fortress-like town hall in Kurashiki was designed in 1958 and completed in 1960. When it was constructed it was situated on the edge of the old town centre connecting it with the newer areas of the town. Kurashiki is better known as a tourist spot for its old Machiya style houses.Kulterman (1970), p. 92 Set in an open square, the building sits on massive columns that taper inwards as they rise. The elevation consists of horizontal planks (some of which are omitted to create windows) which overlap at the corners in a \\"log cabin\\" effect. The entrance is covered with a heavy projecting concrete canopy which leads to a monumental entrance hall. The stair to this hall ascends in cantilevered straight flights to the left and right. The walls to this interior are bare shuttered concrete punctured by windows reminiscent of Le Corbusier's La Tourette. The Council Chamber is a separate building whose raked roof has seating on top of it to form an external performance space.Banham (1978), p. 82 =Tokyo Olympic arenas= Yoyogi National Gymnasium (1964) The Yoyogi National Gymnasium is situated in an open area in Yoyogi Park on an adjacent axis to the Meiji Shrine. The gymnasium and swimming pool were designed by Tange for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which were the first Olympics held in Asia. Tange began his designs in 1961 and the plans were approved by the Ministry of Education in January 1963. The buildings were placed to optimize space available for parking and to permit the smoothest transition of incoming and outgoing people.Kulterman (1970), p. 204 Inspired by the skyline of the Colosseum in Rome, the roofs have a skin suspended from two masts. The buildings were inspired by Le Corbusier's Philips Pavilion designed for Brussel's World Fair and the Ingalls Rink Yale University's hockey stadium by Eero Saarinen (both structures completed in 1958). The roof of the Philips pavilion was created by complex hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces stretched between cables. In both cases Tange took Western ideas and adapted them to meet Japanese requirements.Stewart (1987), p. 218 The gymnasium has a capacity of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At the time it was built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds. Tange won a Pritzker Prize for the design; the citation described the gymnasium as \\"among the most beautiful buildings of the 20th century\\". =Supreme Court Building of Pakistan= The Supreme Court Building, Islamabad The Supreme Court of Pakistan Building is the official and principal workplace of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, located in 44000 Constitution Avenue Islamabad, Pakistan. Completed in 1993, it is flanked by the Prime Minister's Secretariat to the south and President's House and the Parliament Building to the north. Designed by Tange, to a design brief prepared by the PEPAC, the complex was engineered and built by CDA Engineering and Siemens Engineering. =Osaka Exposition 1970= Osaka Expo Festival Plaza (1970) In 1965 the Bureau International des Expositions decided that Japan should host the 1970 Exposition. of land in the Senri Hills near Osaka were put aside for its use. Tange and Uzo Nishiyama were appointed as planners for the masterplan by the Theme Committee. Tange assembled a group of twelve architects to design the infrastructure and facilities for the Expo.Kulterman (1970), p. 282 At the centre of the Expo was the Festival Plaza. Tange conceived that this plaza (with its oversailing space frame roof) would connect the display spaces and create a setting for a \\"festival\\". The plaza divided the site into a northern zone for pavilions and a southern zone for administration facilities. The zones were interconnected with moving pathways.Kulterman (1970), pp. 286‚Äì94 Architectural circle =Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne= Tange's first placing in the design competition for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park gained him recognition from Kunio Maekawa. The elder architect invited Tange to attend the Congr√®s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). Founded in 1928 this organization of planners and architects had initially promoted architecture in economic and social context, but at its fourth meeting in 1933 (under the direction of Le Corbusier) it debated the notion of the \\"Functional City\\". This led to a series of proposals on urban planning known as \\"The Athens Charter\\". By the 1951 CIAM meeting that was held in Hoddesdon, England, to which Tange was invited, the Athens Charter came under debate by younger members of the group (including Tange) who found the Charter too vague in relation to city expansion. The \\"Athens Charter\\" promoted the idea that a city gains character from its continual changes over many years; this notion was written before the advent of mass bombings and the Second World War and therefore held little meaning for Tange who had evidenced the destruction of Hiroshima. The discussions at Hoddesdon sowed discontent within CIAM that eventually contributed to its breakup after their Dubrovnik meeting in 1956;Stewart (1987), pp. 173‚Äì76 the younger members of CIAM formed a splinter group known as Team X, which Tange later joined. Tange presented various designs to Team X in their meetings. At a 1959 meeting in Otterlo, Holland, one of his presentations included an unrealised project by Kiyonori Kikutake; this project became the basis of the Metabolist Movement.Stewart (1987), pp. 176‚Äì77 When Tange travelled back to Japan from the 1951 CIAM meeting, he visited Le Corbusier's nearly complete Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseilles, France. He also looked at the sketches for the new capital of Punjab at Chandigarh, India.Stewart (1987), p. 175 =Tokyo World Design Conference and urban planning= Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre (1966) Tange had left the Team X Otterlo conference early to take up a tenure at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His experiences at the conference may have led him to set his fifth year students a project to design a 25-thousand-person residential community to be erected in Boston over the bay.Stewart (1987), p. 177 The scheme comprised two giant A-frame structures that resembled Tange's competition entry for the World Health Organisation's headquarters on Lake Geneva. Both this scheme and the earlier ones by Kikutake formed the basis of Tange's speech to the Tokyo World Design Conference in 1960. In his speech he used words such as \\"cell\\" and \\"metabolism\\" in relation to urban design. The Metabolist movement grew out of discussions with other members of the conference. Amongst them were Kisho Kurokawa, Junzo Sakakura, Alison and Peter Smithson, Louis Kahn, Jean Prouv√©, B. V. Doshi and Jacob Bakema. The conference ended with Tange's presentation of the Boston plan and his own scheme, \\"The Tokyo Plan ‚Äì 1960\\".Stewart (1987), pp. 179‚Äì81 Tange argued that the normal urban pattern of a radial centripetal transportation system was a relic of the Middle Ages and would not handle the strain placed upon it by the world's mega cities, which he qualified as those with populations greater than 10 million.Kulterman (1970), p. 119 Rather than building up a city from a civic centre, Tange's proposal was based on civic axis, developing the city in a linear fashion.Kulterman (1970), p. 123 Three levels of traffic, graded according to speed, would facilitate the movement of up to 2.5 million people along the axis, which would be divided into vertebrae-like cyclical transportation elements. The sheer size of the proposal meant that it would stretch out across the water of Tokyo Bay.Kulterman (1970), p. 128 Tange's proposals at this conference play a large part in establishing his reputation as \\"The West's favourite Japanese architect\\".Stewart (1987), p. 182 In 1965 Tange was asked by the United Nations to enter a limited competition for the redevelopment of Skopje, which was at that time a city of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The town had been heavily destroyed by an earthquake in 1963. Tange won 60% of the prize; the other 40% was awarded to the Yugoslav team. Tange's design furthered ideas put forward in the earlier \\"Tokyo Plan\\".Kulterman (1970), p. 262 Tange further developed his ideas for expandable urban forms in 1966 when he designed the Yamanashi Broadcasting and Press Centre in K≈çfu. It was designed for three media companies: a newspaper printing plant, a radio station and a television studio. To allow for future expansion Tange grouped the similar functions of three offices together in three zones. The newspaper printing machinery was on the ground floor, sealed studios on the upper floors and offices on glass walled floors surrounded by balconies. The services, including stairs and lifts, are housed in 16 reinforced concrete columns that are of five-metre (17 ft) diameter. Space was left between the cluster of functional space to allow for future expansion, although these have been used for gardens and terraces.Kulterman (1970), p. 246 =Urbanists and Architects Team= Tange's inspiration for his design office came from his friend Walter Gropius who he had first met at the CIAM meeting in 1951. While lecturing at the Bauhaus, Gropius had placed great importance on teaching architects, especially imparting on them the concept of working together as a team. The Urbanists and Architects Team was founded in 1961 and became Kenz≈ç Tange Associates. Tange promoted a very flat hierarchy in the practice: partners were equal in importance and were encouraged to participate in every project. Multiple options were developed simultaneously, and research on individual schemes was encouraged.Kulterman (1970), p. 8 Later career Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office, Shinjuku, Tokyo (1991) During the 1970s and 1980s Tange expanded his portfolio to include buildings in over 20 countries around the world. In 1985, at the behest of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris at that time, Tange proposed a master plan for a plaza at Place d'Italie that would interconnect the city along an east-west axis.Ayers (2004), p. 213 For the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, which opened in 1991, Tange designed a large civic centre with a plaza dominated by two skyscrapers. These house the administration offices whilst a smaller seven-storey building contains assembly facilities. In his design of a high tech version of Kofu Communications Centre, Tange equipped all three buildings with state-of-the- art building management systems that monitored air quality, light levels and security. The external skin of the building makes dual references to both tradition and the modern condition. Tange incorporated vertical and horizontal lines reminiscent of both timber boarding and the lines on semiconductor boards.Doordan (2002), p. 274 Tange continued to practice until three years before his death in 2005. He disliked postmodernism in the 1980s and considered this style of architecture to be only \\"transitional architectural expressions\\". His funeral was held in one of his works, the Tokyo Cathedral. Legacy St. Mary's Cathedral (Tokyo Cathedral), Tokyo (1964) The modular expansion of Tange's Metabolist visions had some influence on Archigram with their plug-in mega structures.Frampton (1990), p. 282 The Metabolist movement gave momentum to Kikutake's career. Although his Marine City proposals (submitted by Tange at CIAM) were not realised, his Miyakonojo City Hall (1966) was a more Metabolist example of Tange's own Nichinan Cultural Centre (1962).Stewart (1987), p. 216 Although the Osaka Expo had marked a decline in the Metabolist movement, it resulted in a \\"handing over\\" of the reigns to a younger generation of architects such as Kazuo Shinohara and Arata Isozaki.Frampton (1990), p. 283 In an interview with Jeremy Melvin at the Royal Academy of Arts, Kengo Kuma explained that, at the age of ten, he was inspired to become an architect after seeing Tange's Olympic arenas, which were constructed in 1964. For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime exemplar of the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of B√©ton brut concrete finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made him a great influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather. He received the AIA Gold Medal in 1966. Tange's son Paul Noritaka Tange graduated from Harvard University in 1985 and went on to join Kenz≈ç Tange Associates. He became the president of Kenzo Tange Associates in 1997 before founding Tange Associates in 2002. Awards * RIBA Gold Medal (1965)Almanac of Architecture & Design 2006, 7th ed. (Greenway, 2006: eds.

Commonly used to express affection, it is a form of endearment and amusement. In rarer cases, it can also be used to express defamation of character, particularly by school bullies. As a concept, it is distinct from both pseudonym and stage name, and also from a title (for example, City of Fountains), although there may be overlap in these concepts. A hypocoristic is a nickname of affection between those in love or with a close emotional bond. \\"Moniker\\" is a synonym.  Etymology  The compound word ekename, literally meaning \\"additional name\\", was attested as early as 1303. This word was derived from the Old English phrase eac \\"also\\", related to eacian \\"to increase\\". By the 15th century, the misdivision of the syllables of the phrase \\"an ekename\\" led to its rephrasing as \\"a nekename\\". Though the spelling has changed, the pronunciation and meaning of the word have remained relatively stable ever since.  Conventions in various languages  English nicknames are generally represented in quotes between the bearer's first and last names (e.g., Dwight David \\"Ike\\" Eisenhower, Daniel Lamont \\"Bubba\\" Franks, etc.). However, it is also common for the nickname to be identified after a comma following the full real name or later in the body of the text, such as in an obituary (e.g., Frankie Frisch, \\"The Fordham Flash\\"). The middle name is generally eliminated (if there is one), especially in speech. Like English, German uses (German-style) quotation marks between the first and last names (e.g., Andreas Nikolaus ‚ÄûNiki‚Äú Lauda). Other languages may use other conventions; for example, Italian writes the nickname after the full name followed by detto 'called' (e.g., Salvatore Schillaci detto Tot√≤), in Spanish the nickname is written in formal contexts at the end in quotes following alias (e.g. Alfonso Tostado, alias ¬´el Abulense¬ª), in Portuguese the nickname is written after the full name followed by vulgo (e.g. Edson Arantes do Nascimento, vulgo Pel√©) and Slovenian represents nicknames after a dash or hyphen (e.g., Franc Rozman ‚Äì Stane). The latter may cause confusion because it resembles an English convention sometimes used for married and maiden names.  Uses in various societies  In Viking societies, many people had heiti, vi√∞rnefni, or kenningarn√∂fn (Old Norse terms for nicknames) which were used in addition to, or instead of the first name. In some circumstances, the giving of a nickname had a special status in Viking society in that it created a relationship between the name maker and the recipient of the nickname, to the extent that the creation of a nickname also often entailed a formal ceremony and an exchange of gifts known in Old Norse as nafnfestr ('fastening a name'). In Indian society, for example, generally people have at least one nickname (call name or affection name) and these affection names are generally not related to the person's proper name. In England, some nicknames are traditionally associated with a person's surname. A man with the surname 'Clark' will be nicknamed 'Nobby': the surname 'Miller' will have the nickname 'Dusty' (alluding to the flour dust of a miller at work): the surname 'Adams' has the nickname 'Nabby'. There are several other nicknames linked traditionally with a person's surname, including Chalky White, Bunny Warren, Tug Wilson, and Spud Baker. Other English nicknames allude to a person's origins. A Scotsman may be nicknamed 'Jock', an Irishman 'Paddy' (alluding to St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland) or 'Mick' (alluding to the preponderance of Roman Catholicism in Ireland), and a Welshman may be nicknamed 'Taffy'. Some nicknames referred ironically to a person's physical characteristics, such as 'Lofty' for a short person, or 'Curly' for a bald man. Traditional English nicknaming - usually for men rather than women - was common through the first half of the 20th century, and was frequently used in the armed services during World War I and World War II, but has become less common since then. In Chinese culture, nicknames are frequently used within a community among relatives, friends and neighbors. A typical southern Chinese nickname often begins with a \\"Èòø\\" followed by another character, usually the last character of the person's given name. For example, Taiwanese politician Chen Shui-bian (Èô≥Ê∞¥ÊâÅ) is sometimes referred as \\"ÈòøÊâÅ\\" (A-Bian). In many Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, nicknames may also connote one's occupation or status. For example, the landlord might be known simply as Towkay () Hokkien for \\"boss\\") to his tenants or workers while a bread seller would be called \\"Mianbao Shu\\" Èù¢ÂåÖÂèî (literally, Uncle Bread). Among Cantonese-speaking communities, the character \\"‰ªî\\" (pronounced \\"zai\\") may be used in a similar context of \\"Junior\\" in Western naming practices.  Computing  In the context of information technology, a nickname (usually called a nick) is a common synonym for the screen name or handle of a user. In computer networks it has become a common practice for every person to also have one or more nicknames for the purposes of pseudonymity, to avoid ambiguity, or simply because the natural name or technical address would be too long to type or take too much space on the screen.  People  James Earl Carter is sworn in as President of the United States using his nickname \\"Jimmy\\" in January 1977. Nicknames are usually applied to a person and they are not always chosen by the recipient themselves. Some nicknames are derogatory name calls. = Abbreviation or modification = A nickname can be a shortened or modified variation on a person's real name. * Contractions of longer names: Margaret to Greta. * Initials: Using the first letters of a person's first and middle/last name, e.g. \\"DJ\\" for Daniel James * Dropping letters: With many nicknames, one or more letters, usually R, are dropped: Fanny from Frances, Walt from Walter. * Phonetic spelling : Sometimes a nickname is created through the phonetic spelling of a name: Len from Leonard. * Letter swapping: During the middle ages, the letter R would often be swapped for either L or D: Hal from Harry; Molly from Mary; Sadie from Sarah; Hob, Dob, Rob, Bob, and Nob from Robert; Rick, Dick, and Hick from Richard; Bill from Will (which in turn comes from William); and Peg and Meg from Margaret. * In 19th-century frontier United States, Mary and Molly were often given the nickname Polly. = Name portions = * Front of name: Sometimes a nickname can come from the beginning of a given name: Chris from Christopher/Christina; Ed from Edward, Edmond, Edgar or Edwin, Iz or Izzy from Isaac, Isaiah, Isidore, Isabel, or Isabella; Joe or Jo from Joseph, Josephine, or Joanna, or Saras from Saraswathi,or Ani from Anita. * End of name: Drew from Andrew, Xander from Alexander, Enzo or Renzo from Lorenzo, Beth from Elizabeth, Bel, Bell, Bella or Belle from Isabelle/Isabella * Middle of name: Liz from Elizabeth, Tori from Victoria or Del or Della from Adelaide * Addition of diminutives: Before the 17th century, most nicknames had the diminutive ending \\"-in\\" or \\"-kin\\", where the ending was attached to the first syllable: Watkin for Walter via Wat-kin; Hobkin from Robert via Hob- kin; or Thompkin from Thomas via Thom-Kin. While most of these have died away, a few remain, such as Robin (Rob-in, from Robert), Hank (Hen-Kin from Henry), Jack (Jan-kin from John), and Colin (Col-in from Nicolas). * Many nicknames drop the final one or two letters and add ether ie/ee/y as a diminutive ending: Davy from David, Charlie from Charles, Mikey from Michael, Jimmy from James and Marty from Martin. * Initialization, which forms a nickname from a person's initials: A.C. Slater from Albert Clifford Slater, or Dubya for George W. Bush, a Texan pronunciation of the name of the letter 'W', President Bush's middle initial. * Nicknames are sometimes based on a person's last name (\\"Tommo\\" for Bill Thompson, \\"Campo\\" for David Campese) or a combination of first and last name such as \\"A-Rod\\" for Alex Rodriguez) * Loose ties to a person's name with an attached suffix: Gazza for English footballer Paul Gascoigne (though used more widely in Australia for Gary) and similar \\"zza\\" forms (Hezza, Prezza, etc.) for other prominent personalities whose activities are frequently reported in the British press. (See also Oxford \\"-er\\" for a similar but wider phenomenon.) * Use of the second name. * Combination of first and middle name, or variations of a person's first and middle name. For example, a person may have the name Mary Elizabeth but has the nickname \\"Maz\\" or \\"Miz\\" by combining Mary and Liz. * Doubling of part of a first name. For example, forming \\"NatNat\\" from Nathan/Natasha or \\"JamJam\\" from James. = Relationship = A nickname may refer to the relationship with the person. This is a term of endearment. * In Japanese culture, Japanese honorifics are designed so that a term of endearment conveys the exact status of the relationship between two people. However, the recipient of the honorific is allowed to restrict the use when used by a certain person.  Titles of geographical places  Many geographical places have titles, or alternative names, which have positive implications. Paris, for example, is the \\"City of Light\\", Venice is \\"La Serenissima\\", and New Jersey is the \\"Garden State\\". It is not correct to call these titles nicknames; these alternative names are often used to boost the status of such places, contrary to the usual role of a nickname. Many places or communities, particularly in the US, adopt titles because they can help in establishing a civic identity, help outsiders recognize a community or attract people to a community, promote civic pride, and build community unity.Muench, David (December 1993) \\"Wisconsin Community Slogans: Their Use and Local Impacts\\" University of Wisconsin - Extension Retrieved April 10, 2007. Titles and slogans that successfully create a new community \\"ideology or myth\\" are also believed to have economic value. Their economic value is difficult to measure, but there are anecdotal reports of cities that have achieved substantial economic benefits by \\"branding\\" themselves by adopting new slogans.Andia, Alfredo (September 10, 2007) \\"Branding the Generic City\\" , MU.DOT magazine By contrast, older city nicknames may be critical: London is still occasionally referred to as \\"The Smoke\\" in memory of its notorious \\"pea-souper\\" smogs (smoke-filled fogs) of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and Edinburgh was \\"Auld Reekie\\" for the same reason, as countless coal fires polluted its atmosphere.  Collective nicknames of inhabitants of a geographical place  Besides or replacing the demonym, some places have collective nicknames for their inhabitants. Many examples of this practice are found in Wallonia and in Belgium in general, where such a nickname is referred to in French as \\"Blason populaire\\".

Initially it was attributed to the sculptor Praxiteles, but based on an inscription that was on its plinth, the statue is now thought to be the work of Alexandros of Antioch. Created sometime between 130 and 100 BC, the statue is believed to depict Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. However, some scholars claim it is the sea-goddess Amphitrite, venerated on Milos. It is a marble sculpture, slightly larger than life size at high. Part of an arm and the original plinth were lost following the statue's discovery. It is currently on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The statue is named after Aphrodite's Roman name, Venus, and the Greek island of Milos, where it was discovered. Description The Venus de Milo's arms are missing, for unknown reasons. There is a filled hole below her right breast that originally contained a metal tenon that would have supported the separately carved right arm. Discovery and history =Discovery= It is generally asserted that the Venus de Milo was discovered on 8 April 1820 by a peasant named Yorgos Kentrotas, inside a buried niche within the ancient city ruins of Milos. Milos is the current village of Trypiti, on the island of Milos (also called Melos, or Milo) in the Aegean, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire. Elsewhere, the discoverers are identified as Yorgos Bottonis and his son Antonio. Paul Carus gave the site of discovery as \\"the ruins of an ancient theater in the vicinity of Castro, the capital of the island\\", adding that Bottonis and his son \\"came accidentally across a small cave, carefully covered with a heavy slab and concealed, which contained a fine marble statue in two pieces, together with several other marble fragments. This happened in February, 1820\\". He apparently based these assertions on an article he had read in the Century Magazine. The Australian historian Edward Duyker, citing a letter written by Louis Brest who was the French consul in Milos in 1820, asserts the discoverer of the statue was Theodoros Kendrotas and that he has been confused with his younger son Giorgios (known phonetically as Yorgos) who later claimed credit for the find. Duyker asserts that Kendrotas was taking stone from a ruined chapel on the edge of his property ‚Äì terraced land that had once formed part of a Roman gymnasium ‚Äì and that he discovered an oblong cavity some 1.2 √ó 1.5 metres (4 √ó 5 ft) deep in the volcanic tuff. It was in this cavity, which had three wings, that Kendrotas first noticed the upper part of the statue. Notwithstanding these anomalies, the consensus is that the statue was found in two large pieces (the upper torso and the lower draped legs) along with several herms (pillars topped with heads), fragments of the upper left arm and left hand holding an apple, and an inscribed plinth. 3D Model =In France= In 1871, during the Paris Commune uprising, many public buildings were burned. The Venus de Milo statue was secreted out of the Louvre Museum in an oak crate and hidden in the basement of the Prefecture of Police. Although the Prefecture was burned, the statue survived undamaged. In 1920, sculptor Robert Ingersoll Aitken created a stir when he criticized the display, lighting, and placement of the statue of Venus de Milo in the museum. In the autumn of 1939, the statue was packed for removal from the Louvre in anticipation of the outbreak of war. Scenery trucks from the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise transported the Louvre's masterpieces to safer locations in the countryside. During World War II, the statue was sheltered safely in the Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay, along with the Winged Victory of Samothrace and Michelangelo's Slaves. =Fame= The great fame of the Venus de Milo during the nineteenth century owed much to a major propaganda effort by the French authorities. In 1815, France had returned the Venus de' Medici (also known as the Medici Venus) to the Italians, after it had been looted by Napoleon Bonaparte. The Medici Venus, regarded as one of the finest classical sculptures in existence, caused the French to promote the Venus de Milo as a greater treasure than that which they recently had lost. The statue was praised dutifully by many artists and critics as the epitome of graceful female beauty. However, Pierre-Auguste Renoir was among its detractors, labelling it a \\"big gendarme\\". Modern use A restoration proposal by archaeologist and art historian Adolf Furtw√§ngler in 1916 showing how the statue may have originally looked The statue has greatly influenced masters of modern art; one prime example is Salvador Dal√≠'s Venus de Milo with Drawers. The statue was formerly part of the seal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), one of the oldest associations of plastic surgeons in the world. In February 2010, the German magazine Focus featured a doctored image of this Venus giving Europe the middle finger, which resulted in a defamation lawsuit against the journalists and the publication. They were found not guilty by the Greek court. Origin of fame Upon its discovery in 1820, the Venus de Milo was always considered to be a significant artistic finding, but did not gain its status as an icon until later on. The exact circumstances in which she was discovered, however, are uncertain and will probably always remain this way. But, we do know that at this time, the Louvre and in turn, French art as a whole, had suffered great losses when Napoleon‚Äôs looted art collection was returned to their countries of origin. The museum lost some of its most iconic pieces, like Rome‚Äôs Laocoon and His Sons and Italy‚Äôs Venus de Medici. The hole that this left in French culture allowed the perfect path for the Venus de Milo to become an international icon. Based on early drawings, the plinth that had been detached from the statue was known to have dates on it, which revealed that it was created after the Classical period, which was the most desirable artistic period. This caused the French to hide the plinth, in an effort to conceal this fact before her introduction to the Louvre in 1821. She held a prime spot in the gallery, and became iconic, mostly due to the Louvre‚Äôs branding campaign and emphasis on her importance in order to regain national pride. This is why she is the most notable and universally known Venus statue. Perception Upon the first arrival of the Venus de Milo to the Louvre, she was accepted and praised immediately, believed to be a Classical Grecian masterpiece. Even once the statue was discovered to have actually been created in the Hellenistic period, she still held the same amount of popularity around the world. Many artists were inspired by the beautiful sculpture, which eventually led to her role in pop culture. Inspired works Many modern artists have been inspired by this piece since she first arrived at the Louvre. (ancient eu) One of the more notable pieces was created by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul C√©zanne who drew a pencil study in 1881. Another inspired work was by Ren√© Magritte, who painted a reduced-scale version of plaster, with bright pink and dark blue, entitled ‚ÄúLes Menottes de Cuivre‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Copper Handcuffs‚Äù in 1931. Even more recently are the works of Neo-Dada Pop artist Jim Dine, who often utilizes the Venus de Milo in his sculptures and paintings since the 1970s. But, possibly the most widely-known adaptation is that of Salvador Dal√≠, with his 1936 creation ‚ÄúVenus de Milo aux tiroirs (Venus of Milos with Drawers).‚Äù The Spanish Surrealist created a half-size plaster cast, painted it, and covered the slightly open drawers with metal knobs and fur pom-poms. This inspired recreation of the famous sculpture was meant to display the ‚Äúgoddess of love as a fetishistic anthropomorphic cabinet with secret drawers filled with a maelstrom of mysteries of sexual desires that only a modern psychoanalyst can interpret‚Äù (Oppen & Meijer, 2019). The image of the Venus de Milo is seen constantly in modern culture, whether it be in magazines, advertisements, or home decor. The references to the sculpture go on and on, which speaks to her ability to maintain relevance. Facts This Grecian statue is believed to depict the Greek Goddess of love and beauty, which they would refer to as Aphrodite. But, the Louvre chose to label her as Venus instead, and the name remained. While most accept the statue as a depiction of Venus/Aphrodite, and some believe it depicts the sea goddess Amphitrite, others still believe it is neither. Amphitrite was widely popular on the island on which the statue was found, fueling this opinion. This debate is still very much alive, but with a lack of evidence and clues, like her missing arm, it is difficult to determine a definitive answer. If the arm had been holding something, like a spear, apple or a spool of thread, it would give much more insight into who the statue is and put the debate to rest. Much like the plinth, the French are also responsible for the loss of the statues‚Äô arms. Kentrotas, who originally uncovered the statue, found fragments of an arm and hand, but they were discarded by the French. The Venus sculpture was also robbed of her accessories, like a bracelet and earrings. These were presumably gone long before her discovery, but the proof of their existence lies in the remaining holes where the objects were fastened to her body. In the fall of 1939, the French relocated the Venus de Milo and other important pieces to a chateau in the French countryside in fear of a war invasion in Paris. Cultural impact =Comedy= Charlie Drake had a sketch in which the statue lost its arms as a result of careless work by museum employees tasked with packing it. Dean Martin referenced the statue on a TV special in a segment involving a woman from the studio audience joining him on stage. The nervous young lady giggled and repeatedly started to bite her nails. Martin gently brushed her hand away and said, \\"Don't bite your nails, look what happened to the Venus de Milo!\\"Robert Hanks Television Review independent.co.uk 25 May 1999 The film Carry on Cleo has a skit showing how the statue lost its arms. An Asterix film has a similar skit. =Film and television= A plot to steal the statue is at the center of the spoof spy film The Last of the Secret Agents? (1966), starring Marty Allen and Steve Rossi. In The Tick episode \\"Armless but Not Harmless\\", the villains Venus and Milo rob an art museum. In The Simpsons episode \\"Homer Badman\\", a Gummi Venus de Milo parodies the statue. In Disney's Hercules, there is a scene where Hercules skips a stone and accidentally breaks off both arms. In Twin Peaks, the Venus de Milo is in the Red Room. In the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, Del Boy shows Rodney a model of the statue claiming there are sick-minded people in the world who would make such a statue of a disabled person. In The Goodies episode Rome Antics, which was set in ancient times, Emperor Tim has the complete statue in his quarters. Graeme enters, removes his cloak, and throws it over one of the arms. The head falls off. =Music= * The song \\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\", written by Chuck Berry and covered by Buddy Holly contains the lyrics, \\"The Venus de Milo was a beautiful lass.

Today, it is considered an ancillary weapon or a weapon of last resort. History Depiction of a 16th century Chinese breech-loading musket with a plug bayonet attached. The weapon's instructional manual and specifications is shown above. The term bayonette itself dates back to the second half of the 16th century, but it is not clear whether bayonets at the time were knives that could be fitted to the ends of firearms, or simply a type of knife. For example, Cotgrave's 1611 Dictionarie describes the bayonet as \\"a kind of small flat pocket dagger, furnished with knives; or a great knife to hang at the girdle\\". Likewise, Pierre Borel wrote in 1655 that a kind of long-knife called a bayonette was made in Bayonne but does not give any further description.H. Blackmore, Hunting Weapons, p. 50 =Plug bayonets= 17th-century plug bayonet The first recorded instance of a bayonet proper is found in the Chinese military treatise published in 1606. It was in the form of the , a breech-loading musket that was issued with a roughly long plug bayonet, giving it an overall length of with the bayonet attached. It was labelled as a \\"gun-blade\\" (traditional Chinese: ; simplified Chinese: ) with it being described as a \\"short sword that can be inserted into the barrel and secured by twisting it slightly\\" that it is to be used \\"when the battle have depleted both gunpowder and bullets as well as fighting against bandits, when forces are closing into melee or encountering an ambush\\" and if one \\"cannot load the gun within the time it takes to cover two bu (3.2 meters) of ground they are to attach the bayonet and hold it like a spear\\".Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 456.Binglu „ÄäÂÖµÈåÑ„Äã, Scroll 12. Early bayonets were of the \\"plug\\" type, where the bayonet was fitted directly into the barrel of the musket.Cold Steel - The History of the Bayonet, BBC News, 18 November 2002, retrieved 29 July 2011 This allowed light infantry to be converted to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. The first known mention of the use of bayonets in European warfare was in the memoirs of Jacques de Chastenet, Vicomte de Puys√©gur. He described the French using crude plug bayonets during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). However, it was not until 1671 that General Jean Martinet standardized and issued plug bayonets to the French regiment of fusiliers then raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment raised in 1672, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685. =Socket bayonets= Socket of a bayonet Early 19th- century offset spiked socket bayonet The major problem with plug bayonets was that when attached they made it impossible to fire the musket, requiring soldiers to wait until the last possible moment before a melee to fix the bayonet. The defeat of forces loyal to William of Orange by Jacobite Highlanders at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 was due (among other things) to the use of the plug bayonet. The Highlanders closed to 50 metres, fired a single volley, dropped their muskets, and using axes and swords quickly overwhelmed the loyalists before they had time to fix bayonets. Shortly thereafter, the defeated leader, Hugh Mackay, is believed to have introduced a socket bayonet of his own invention. Soon \\"socket\\" bayonets would incorporate both socket mounts and an offset blade that fit around the musket's barrel, which allowed the musket to be fired and reloaded while the bayonet was attached. An unsuccessful trial with socket or zigzag bayonets was made after the Battle of Fleurus in 1690, in the presence of King Louis XIV, who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the Peace of Ryswick (1697), the English and Germans abolished the pike and introduced socket bayonets. The British socket bayonet had a triangular blade with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of . However it had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle and was well-documented for falling off in the heat of battle. By the 18th century, socket bayonets had been adopted by most European armies. In 1703, the French infantry adopted a spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged models, creating wounds which were harder to treat due to the propensity of healing scar tissue to pull apart the triangular incision. =Sword bayonets= The 19th century introduced the concept of the sword bayonet, a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a shortsword. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an infantry square properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the British Infantry Rifle of 1800‚Äì1840, later known as the \\"Baker Rifle\\". The hilt usually had quillons modified to accommodate the gun barrel and a hilt mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a bayonet lug. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a side arm. When attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned almost any long gun into a spear or glaive, suitable not only for thrusting but also for slashing. Chassepot bolt-action rifle and sword bayonet. While the British Army eventually discarded the sword bayonet, the socket bayonet survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system. The new bayonet proved its worth at the Battle of Alma and the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it. Bayonet assembly system of the Chassepot From 1869, some European nations began to develop new bolt-action breechloading rifles (such as the Chassepot) and sword bayonets suitable for mass production and for use by police, pioneer, and engineer troops.Owen, John Ivor Headon, Brassey's Infantry Weapons of the World: Infantry Weapons and Combat Aids in Current Use by the Regular and Reserve Forces of All Nations, Bonanza Press, , (1975), p. 265 The decision to redesign the bayonet into a short sword was viewed by some as an acknowledgement of the decline in importance of the fixed bayonet as a weapon in the face of new advances in firearms technology.Punch, \\"The Soldier's Side-Companion\\", Punch's Almanack For 1869, Vol. 57 (7 August 1869), London: Punch Publications Ltd. (1869), p. 54 As a British newspaper put it, \\"the committee, in recommending this new sword bayonet, appear to have had in view the fact that bayonets will henceforth be less frequently used than in former times as a weapon of offence and defence; they desired, therefore, to substitute an instrument of more general utility.\\" =Multipurpose bayonets= British Pattern 1875 Snider saw- backed bayonet (with scabbard) for artillery carbine One of these multipurpose designs was the 'sawback' bayonet, which incorporated saw teeth on the spine of the blade. The sawback bayonet was intended for use as a general-purpose utility tool as well as a weapon; the teeth were meant to facilitate the cutting of wood for various defensive works such as barbed-wire posts, as well as for butchering livestock.Knight, Edward H., Knight's American Mechanical Dictionary (Vol. 1), New York: J. B. Ford & Co. (1874), p. 252Rhodes, Bill, An Introduction to Military Ethics: A Reference Handbook, ABC CLIO LLC, , (2009), pp. 13-14 It was initially adopted by the German states in 1865; until the middle of WWI approximately 5% of every bayonet style was complemented with a sawback version, for example in Belgium in 1868, Great Britain in 1869 and Switzerland in 1878 (Switzerland introduced their last model in 1914).Foulkes, Charles J., and Hopkinson, Edward C., Sword, Lance & Bayonet: A Record of the Arms of the British Army & Navy (2nd ed.), Edgware, Middlesex: Arms & Armour Press (1967) p. 113 The original sawback bayonets were typically of the heavy sword-type, they were issued to engineers, with to some extent the bayonet aspect being secondary to the \\"tool\\" aspect. Later German sawbacks were more of a rank indicator than a functional saw. The sawback proved relatively ineffective as a cutting tool, and was soon outmoded by improvements in military logistics and transportation; most nations dropped the sawback feature by 1900. The German army discontinued use of the sawback bayonet in 1917 after protests that the serrated blade caused unnecessarily severe wounds when used as a fixed bayonet. U.S. Bayonet Model 1873 trowel The trowel or spade bayonet was another multipurpose design, intended for use both as an offensive weapon as well as a digging tool for excavating entrenchments.Ripley, George, and Dana, Charles A., The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge (Vol. II), New York: D. Appleton & Co. (1873), p. 409Board of Officers Assembled at St. Louis, Missouri, Schofield, J.M. (Maj. Gen.) President, Bayonets: Resume of the Proceedings of the Board, June 10, 1870, Ordnance Memoranda, Issue 11, United States Army Ordnance Dept., Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1870), p. 16 From 1870, the US Army issued trowel bayonets to infantry regiments based on a design by Lieutenant-Colonel Edmund Rice, a US Army officer and Civil War veteran, which were manufactured by the Springfield Armory.Belknap, William W., Trowel-Bayonet, Letter from the Secretary of War In Answer to a Resolution of the House of April 4, 1872, The Executive Documents of the House of Representatives, 42nd Congress, 2nd Session (1871‚Äì1872), Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1872), pp. 1‚Äì20 Besides its utility as both a fixed bayonet and a digging implement, the Rice trowel bayonet could be used to plaster log huts and stone chimneys for winter quarters; sharpened on one edge, it could cut tent poles and pins. Ten thousand were eventually issued, and the design saw service during the 1877 Nez Perce campaign.McChristian, Douglas C., Uniforms, Arms, and Equipment: Weapons and Accouterments, University of Oklahoma Press, , (2007), pp. 128‚Äì142 Rice was given leave in 1877 to demonstrate his trowel bayonet to several nations in Europe. One infantry officer recommended it to the exclusion of all other designs, noting that \\"the intrenching tools of an army rarely get up to the front until the exigency for their use has passed.\\" The Rice trowel bayonet was declared obsolete by the US Army in December 1881. =\\"Reach\\" controversy= German soldiers at bayonet practice in 1914 Six sailors with Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles, standing in the 'On Guard' position during rifle and bayonet drill on board the battleship . October 1940. From 1899 to 1945, the Japanese used the very long, 15.75 inches (25.4 cm), Type 30 sword-bladed bayonet on the already very long Arisaka rifle. Prior to World War I, bayonet doctrine was largely founded upon the concept of \\"reach\\"; that is, a soldier's theoretical ability, by use of an extremely long rifle and fixed bayonet, to stab an enemy soldier without having to approach within reach of his opponent's blade.Hutton, Alfred, Fixed Bayonets: A Complete System of Fence for the British Magazine Rifle, London: William Clowes & Sons (1890), pp. v, 125, 131‚Äì132Barrett, Ashley W., \\"Lessons to be Learned by Regimental Officers from the Russo-Japanese War\\", \\"Journal of the Military Service Institution of the United States\\", Volume 45, (March‚ÄìApril 1909), pp. 300‚Äì301. A combined length of rifle and bayonet longer than that of the enemy infantryman's rifle and attached bayonet, like the infantryman's pike of bygone days, was thought to impart a tactical advantage on the battlefield.Hopkins, Albert A., Scientific American War Book: the Mechanism and Technique of Warfare, New York: Munn & Co. (1915) p. 141Praktische Bajonett-Fechtschule: auf Grund der Bajonettir-Vorschrift f√ºr die Infanterie, Berlin: E. S. Mittler und Sohn (1889) In 1886, the French army introduced a quadrangular √©p√©e spike for the bayonet of the Lebel Model 1886 rifle, the √âp√©e-Ba√Øonnette Mod√®le 1886, resulting in a rifle and bayonet with an overall length of . Germany responded by introducing a long sword bayonet for the Model 1898 Mauser rifle, which had a 29-inch barrel. The bayonet, the Seitengewehr 98, had a 50 cm (19.7-inch) blade. With an overall length of , the German army's rifle/bayonet combination was second only to the French Lebel for overall 'reach'. After 1900, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States adopted rifles with barrel lengths shorter than that of a rifled musket, but longer than that of a carbine.Seton-Karr, Henry (Sir), \\"Rifle\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.), New York: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Co., Vol. 23 (Ref‚ÄìSai)(1911), p. 328 These were intended for general use by infantry and cavalry. The \\"reach\\" of the new short rifles with attached bayonet was reduced. Britain introduced the shortened Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle, the SMLE, in 1904. The German M1898 Mauser rifle and attached sword bayonet was 20 cm (eight inches) longer than the SMLE and its P1903 bayonet, which used a twelve-inch (30 cm) blade.Pegler, Martin and Chappell, Mike, Tommy 1914‚Äì18 (Vol. 16), New York: Osprey Publishing Ltd., , (1996), p. 16 While the British P1903 and its similar predecessor, the P1888, was satisfactory in service, criticism soon arose regarding the shortened reach.Tilson, John Q. (Hon.), Weapons of Aerial Warfare: Speech By Hon. John Q. Tilson, Delivered June 1, 1917, United States House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1918), p. 84 One military writer of the day warned: \\"The German soldier has eight inches the better of the argument over the British soldier when it comes to crossing bayonets, and the extra eight inches easily turns the battle in favour of the longer, if both men are of equal skill.\\" In 1905, the German Army adopted a shortened bayonet, the Seitengewehr 98/06 for engineer and pioneer troops, and in 1908, a short rifle as well, the Karabiner Model 1898AZ, which was produced in limited quantities for the cavalry, artillery, and other specialist troops.James, Gary, \\"Germany's Karabiner 98AZ \\", Guns & Ammo (June 2010), retrieved 17 November 2011 However, the long-barreled 98 Mauser rifle remained in service as the primary infantry small arm.Ezell, Edward C., Small Arms of the World: A Basic Manual of Small Arms, Volume 11, p. 502 Moreover, German military authorities continued to promote the idea of outreaching one's opponent on the battlefield by means of a longer rifle/bayonet combination, a concept prominently featured in its infantry bayonet training doctrines. These included the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack.Crossman, Edward C., \\"The Rifle of the Hun\\", Popular Mechanics, Vol. 30, No. 2 (1918), pp. 183‚Äì185. Using this tactic, the German soldier dropped into a half-crouch, with the rifle and fixed bayonet held close to the body. In this position the soldier next propelled his rifle forward, then dropped the supporting hand while taking a step forward with the right foot, simultaneously thrusting out the right arm to full length with the extended rifle held in the grip of the right hand alone. With a maximum 'kill zone' of some eleven feet, the throw point bayonet attack gave an impressive increase in 'reach', and was later adopted by other military forces, including the U.S. Army.Stacey, Cromwell (Capt.), \\"Training in Bayonet Fighting: Throw Point\\", U.S. Infantry Journal, Vol. 10, No. 6 (1914) pp. 870‚Äì871. In response to criticism over the reduced reach of the SMLE rifle and bayonet, British ordnance authorities introduced the P1907 bayonet in 1908, which had an elongated blade of some seventeen inches to compensate for the reduced overall length of the SMLE rifle.Notes On Naval Progress, Section II: Small Arms, General Information Series Volume 20, United States Office of Naval Intelligence, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (July 1901), p. 198Regan, Paula (ed.), Weapon: A Visual History of Arms and Armor, London: Penguin Ltd. , (2006), p. 284. The 1907 bayonet was essentially a copy of the Japanese Type 30 bayonet, Britain having purchased a number of Japanese type 30 rifles for the Royal Navy during the preceding years. U.S. authorities in turn adopted a long (16-in. blade) bayonet for the M1903 Springfield short rifle, the M1905 bayonet; later, a long sword bayonet was also provided for the M1917 Enfield rifle. =Reversal in opinion= US military bayonets; from the top down, they are the M1905, the M1, M1905E1 Bowie Point Bayonet (a cut down version of the M1905), and the M4 Bayonet for the M1 Carbine. The experience of World War I reversed opinion on the value of long rifles and bayonets in typical infantry combat operations.Knyvett, R. Hugh (Capt.), Over There with the Australians, originally published 1918, reprinted by The Echo Library, (2011), pp. 152‚Äì153. Whether in the close confines of trench warfare, night time raiding and patrolling, or attacking across open ground, soldiers of both sides soon recognized the inherent limitations of a long and ungainly rifle and bayonet when used as a close-quarters battle weapon.McBride, Herbert W., A Rifleman Went to War, Plantersville, SC: Small Arms Technical Publishing Co. (1935), pp. 179‚Äì185, 197, 241‚Äì243, 335 Once Allied soldiers had been trained to expect the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack, the method lost most of its tactical value on the World War I battlefield. It required a strong arm and wrist, was very slow to recover if the initial thrust missed its mark, and was easily parried by a soldier who was trained to expect it, thus exposing the German soldier to a return thrust which he could not easily block or parry.Moss, James Alfred, Manual of Military Training, Menasha, WI: George Banta Publishing Co. (1914), p. 161: \\"The adversary may attempt a greater extension in the thrust and lunge by quitting the grasp of his piece with the left hand and advancing the right as far as possible. When this is done, a sharp parry may cause him to lose control of his rifle, leaving him exposed to a counter-attack, which should follow promptly.\\"United States Marine Corps, U.S. Marine Combat Conditioning, United States Marine Corps Schools (Sep 1944), reprinted Skyhorse Publishing Inc., , (2011), p. 7: \\"The...'throw point' as it is sometimes called can be used to thrust from a distance an unarmed enemy who is running backwards away from you. This would probably be the only time you would actually thrust a man with a...'throw point'...because unless your enemy is off his guard and unless you have a very strong arm, there is too much chance of dropping the rifle or of his knocking it from your hands.\\" Instead of longer bayonets, infantry forces on both sides began experimenting with other weapons as auxiliary close-quarter arms, including the trench knife, pistol, hand grenade, and entrenching tool.Beith, Ian H., \\"Modern Battle Tactics: Address Delivered April 9, 1917\\", National Service (June 1917), pp. 325, 328 Soldiers soon began employing the bayonet as a knife as well as an attachment for the rifle, and bayonets were often shortened officially or unofficially to make them more versatile and easier to use as tools, or to maneuver in close quarters. During World War II, bayonets were further shortened into knife-sized weapons in order to give them additional utility as fighting or utility knives. The vast majority of modern bayonets introduced since World War II are of the knife bayonet type. Bayonet charge The development of the bayonet in the late 17th century led to the bayonet charge becoming the main infantry tactic through the 19th century and into the 20th. As early as the 19th century, military scholars were already noting that most bayonet charges did not result in close combat. Instead, one side usually fled before actual bayonet fighting ensued. The act of fixing bayonets has been held to be primarily connected to morale, the making of a clear signal to friend and foe of a willingness to kill at close quarters. =Napoleonic wars= A bayonet charge during the Battle of Gro√übeeren (1813) The bayonet charge was a common tactic used during the Napoleonic wars. Despite its effectiveness, a bayonet charge did not necessarily cause substantial casualties through the use of the weapon itself. Detailed battle casualty lists from the 18th century showed that in many battles, fewer than 2% of all wounds treated were caused by bayonets.Lynn, John A. Giant of the Grand Si√®cle: The French Army, 1610-1715. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1997. Print. Antoine-Henri Jomini, a celebrated military author who served in numerous armies during the Napoleonic period, stated that the majority of bayonet charges in the open resulted with one side fleeing before any contact was made. Combat with bayonets did occur, but mostly on a small scale when units of opposing sides encountered each other in a confined environment, such as during the storming of fortifications or during ambush skirmishes in broken terrain.Jomini, Antoine Henri. The Art of War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1971. Print. In an age of fire by massed volley, when compared to random unseen bullets, the threat of the bayonet was much more tangible and immediate ‚Äì guaranteed to lead to a personal gruesome conclusion if both sides persisted. All this encouraged men to flee before the lines met. Thus, the bayonet was an immensely useful weapon for capturing ground from the enemy, despite seldom actually being used to inflict wounds. =American Civil War= A bayonet charge during the American Civil War During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) the bayonet was found to be responsible for less than 1% of battlefield casualties,O'Connell, Robert L., \\"Arme Blanche\\", Military History Quarterly, Vol. 5, n¬∫ 1. a hallmark of modern warfare. The use of bayonet charges to force the enemy to retreat was very successful in numerous small unit engagements at short range in the American Civil War, as most troops would retreat when charged while reloading (which could take up to a minute with loose powder even for trained troops). Although such charges inflicted few casualties, they often decided short engagements, and tactical possession of important defensive ground features. Additionally, bayonet drill could be used to rally men temporarily discomfited by enemy fire.The Bloody Crucible of Courage: Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War While the overall Battle of Gettysburg was won by the Union armies due to a combination of terrain and massed artillery fire, a decisive point on the second day of the battle hinged on a bayonet charge at Little Round Top when the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, running short of musket ammunition, charged downhill, surprising and capturing many of the surviving soldiers of the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments. =Going over the top= 1886 Lebel rifles. The popular image of a World War I combat is of a wave of soldiers with bayonets fixed, \\"going over the top\\" and charging across no man's land into a hail of enemy fire. Although this was the standard method of fighting early in the war, it was rarely successful. British casualties on the first day of the Battle of the Somme were the worst in the history of the British army, with casualties, whom were killed. During World War I, no man's land was often hundreds of yards across. The area was usually devastated by the warfare and riddled with craters from artillery and mortar shells, and sometimes contaminated by chemical weapons. Heavily defended by machine guns, mortars, artillery and riflemen on both sides, it was often covered with barbed wire and land mines, and littered with the rotting corpses of those who were not able to make it across the sea of bullets, explosions and flames. A bayonet charge through no man's land often resulted in the total annihilation of entire battalions. A stretch of no man's land in Flanders Fields, France, 1919 =Banzai charges= The advent of modern warfare in the 20th century made bayonet charges dubious affairs. During the Siege of Port Arthur (1904‚Äì05), the Japanese used suicidal human wave attacks against Russian artillery and machine guns, suffering massive casualties. One description of the aftermath was that a \\"thick, unbroken mass of corpses covered the cold earth like a [carpet]\\". Dead Japanese troops lie where they fell on Attu Island after a final banzai charge against American forces on May 29, 1943 during the Battle of Attu. However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese were able to effectively use bayonet charges against poorly organized and lightly armed Chinese troops. \\"Banzai charges\\" became an accepted military tactic where Japanese forces were able to routinely rout larger Chinese forces. In the early stages of the Pacific War, a sudden banzai charge might overwhelm small groups of enemy soldiers unprepared for such an attack. But, by the end of the war, against well organized and heavily armed Allied forces, a banzai charge inflicted little damage while its participants suffered horrendous losses. At best, they were conducted as a last resort by small groups of surviving soldiers when the main battle was already lost. At worst, they wasted valuable resources in men and weapons, which hastened defeat. Some Japanese commanders, such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, recognized the futility and waste of such attacks and expressly forbade their men from carrying them out. Indeed, the Americans were surprised that the Japanese did not employ banzai charges at the Battle of Iwo Jima.According to military historian Shigetoki Hosoki, \\"This writer was stunned to find the following comments in the 'Iwo Jima Report', a collection of memoirs by Iwo Jima survivors. 'The men we saw weighed no more than thirty kilos and did not look human. Nonetheless, these emaciated soldiers who looked like they came from Mars faced the enemy with a force that could not be believed. I sensed a high morale.' Even under such circumstances, the underground shelters that the Japanese built proved advantageous for a while. Enemy mortar and bombing could not reach them ten meters underground. It was then that the Americans began to dig holes and poured yellow phosphorus gas into the ground. Their infantry was also burning its way through passages, slowly but surely, at the rate of ten meters per hour. A telegram has been preserved which says, 'This is like killing cockroaches.' American troops made daily advances to the north. On the evening of 16 March, they reported that they had completely occupied the island of Iwo Jima.\\" Picture Letters from the Commander-in-Chief, page 237. =Human wave attack= The term \\"human wave attack\\" was often misused to describe the Chinese short attack. ‚Äî a combination of infiltration and the shock tactics employed by the PLA during the Korean War.. A typical Chinese short attack was carried out at night by sending a series of small five-men fireteams to attack the weakest point of an enemy's defenses. The Chinese assault team would crawl undetected within grenade range, then launch surprise attacks with fixed bayonets against the defenders in order to breach the defenses by relying on maximum shock and confusion. If the initial shock failed to breach the defenses, additional fireteams would press on behind them and attack the same point until a breach was created. Once penetration was achieved, the bulk of the Chinese forces would move into the enemy rear and attack from behind.. Due to primitive communication systems and tight political controls within the Chinese army, short attacks were often repeated until either the defenses were penetrated or the attackers were completely annihilated. This persistent attack pattern left a strong impression on UN forces that fought in Korea, giving birth to the description of \\"human wave\\".. The term \\"human wave\\" was later used by journalists and military officials to convey the image of the American soldiers being assaulted by overwhelming numbers of Chinese on a broad front, which is inaccurate when compared with the normal Chinese practice of sending successive series of small teams against a weak points of the line.. It was in fact rare for the Chinese to actually use densely concentrated infantry formations to absorb enemy firepower.. =Last hurrahs= A life-size diorama at the US Army Infantry Museum, Fort Benning, Georgia, depicting Millett's charge up Hill 180 during the Korean War that resulted in his receipt of the Medal of Honor. During the Korean War, the French Battalion and Turkish Brigade were not averse to using bayonet charges against their enemy. United States Army officer Lewis L. Millett led soldiers of the US Army's 27th Infantry Regiment in taking out a machine gun position with bayonets. Historian S. L. A. Marshall described the attack as \\"the most complete bayonet charge by American troops since Cold Harbor\\". Out of about 50 enemy dead, roughly 20 were found to have been killed by bayonets, and the location subsequently became known as Bayonet Hill. This was the last bayonet charge by the US Army. For his leadership during the assault, Millett was awarded the Medal of Honor. The medal was formally presented to him by President Harry S. Truman in July 1951. He was also awarded the Army's second- highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross, for leading another bayonet charge in the same month. In 1982, the British Army mounted bayonet charges during the Falklands War, notably the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Mount Longdon and the 2nd Battalion, Scots Guards during the final assault of Mount Tumbledown. In 1995, during the Siege of Sarajevo, French Marine infantrymen from the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment carried out a bayonet charge against the Serbian forces at the Battle of Vrbanja bridge. Actions led by the regiment allowed the United Nations blue helmets to exit from a passive position due to a first time engagement in hostile responses. Two fatalities resulted from this event with seventeen others wounded. During the Second Gulf War and the war in Afghanistan, the British Army units mounted bayonet charges. In 2004 in Iraq at the Battle of Danny Boy, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders bayonet-charged mortar positions filled with over 100 Mahdi Army members. The ensuing hand-to-hand fighting resulted in an estimate of over 40 insurgents killed and 35 bodies collected (many floated down the river) and nine prisoners. Sergeant Brian Wood, of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the battle. In 2009, Lieutenant James Adamson of the Royal Regiment of Scotland was awarded the Military Cross for a bayonet charge while on a tour of duty in Afghanistan: after shooting one Taliban fighter dead, Adamson had run out of ammunition when another enemy appeared. He immediately charged the second Taliban fighter and bayoneted him. In September 2012, Lance Corporal Sean Jones of The Princess of Wales's Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his role in a bayonet charge which took place in October 2011. Contemporary bayonets Today the bayonet is rarely used in one-to-one combat. Despite its limitations, many modern assault rifles (including bullpup designs) retain a bayonet lug and the bayonet is still issued by many armies. The bayonet is still used for controlling prisoners, or as a weapon of last resort. In addition, some authorities have concluded that the bayonet serves as a useful training aid in building morale and increasing desired aggressiveness in troops.U.S. Army Field Manual 3-25.150, 2002-12-18. Today's bayonets often double as multi-purpose utility knives, bottle openers or throwing knives.Glock Field Knives Also, issuing one modern multi-purpose bayonet/knife is obviously more cost effective than issuing separate specialty bayonets, field knives and combat knives. =USSR= The original AK-47 has an adequate but unremarkable bayonet. However, the AKM Type I bayonet (introduced in 1959) was a revolutionary design.http://worldbayonets.com/Misc__Pages/ak_bayonets/ak_bayonets.html Kalashnikov Bayonets Ralph E. Cobb, 2010 It has a Bowie style (clip-point) blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose survival knife and wire-cutter when combined with its steel scabbard.how to use the wire cutter on an akm /ak 47 bayonet. YouTube (16 July 2009). Retrieved on 2011-09-27. This design was copied by other nations and formed the basis of the US M9 bayonet.http://www.tactical-life.com/online/tactical- knives/akm-47-bayonet-from-battle/AKM-47 Bayonet From Battle. by Steven Dick The AK-74 bayonet 6Kh5 (introduced in 1983) represents a further refinement of the AKM bayonet. \\"It introduced a radical blade cross-section, that has a flat milled on one side near the edge and a corresponding flat milled on the opposite side near the false edge.\\" The blade has a new spear point and an improved one-piece moulded plastic grip, making it a more effective fighting knife. It also has saw-teeth on the false edge and the usual hole for use as a wire-cutter. The wire cutting versions of the AK bayonets each have an electrically insulated handle and an electrically insulated part of the scabbard, so it can be used to cut an electrified wire. =United States= The American M16 rifle used the M7 bayonet which is based on earlier designs such as the M4, M5 and M6 models, all of which are direct descendants of the M3 Fighting Knife and have a spear-point blade with a half sharpened secondary edge. The newer M9 has a clip-point blade with saw-teeth along the spine, and can be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. It can even be used by troops to cut their way free through the relatively thin metal skin of a crashed helicopter or airplane. The current USMC OKC-3S bayonet bears a resemblance to the Marines' iconic Ka-Bar fighting knife with serrations near the handle. =People's Republic of China= The AK-47 assault rifle was copied by China as the Type 56 assault rifle and include an integral folding spike bayonet, similar to the SKS rifle. Some Type 56s may also use the AKM Type II bayonet. The latest Chinese rifle, the QBZ-95, has the multi-purpose knife bayonet similar to the US M9. =Belgium= The FN FAL has two types of bayonet. The first is a traditional spear point bayonet. The second is the Type C socket bayonet introduced in the 1960s.http://worldbayonets.com/Bayonet_Identification_Guide/fal_page/fal_bayonets.htmlWorld Bayonets. FN FAL Bayonets It has a hollow handle that fits over the muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the FALs 22 mm NATO-spec flash hider.

The blade is offset to the side of the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a multi-purpose knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade. =Germany= The H&K; G3 rifle uses two types of bayonets, both of which mount above the G3's barrel. The first is the standard G3 bayonet which has a blade similar to the American M7. The second is an EICKHORN KCB-70 type multi-purpose knife bayonet, featuring a clip-point with saw-back, a wire-cutter scabbard and a distinctive squared handgrip. For the H&K; G36 there was little use of modified AKM type II blade bayonets from stocks of the former Nationale Volksarmee (National People's Army) of East Germany. The original muzzle-ring was cut away and a new, large diameter muzzle ring welded in place. The original leather belt hanger was replaced by a complex web and plastic belt hanger designed to fit the West German load bearing equipment.World Bayonets. Unified Germany =Austria= The Steyr AUG uses two types of bayonet. The first and most common is an Eickhorn KCB-70 type multi-purpose bayonet with an M16 bayonet type interface. The second are the Glock Feldmesser 78 (Field Knife 78) and the Feldmesser 81 (Survival Knife 81), which can also be used as a bayonet, by engaging a socket in the pommel (covered by a plastic cap) into a bayonet adapter that can be fitted to the AUG rifle.World Bayonets. AustriaWorld Bayonets. Austria. Image of Glock Knife mounted on Stryr AUGGlock 78 field knife or bayonet. Created on 23 July 2012. Written by Ramon A. Castella. These bayonets are noteworthy, as they were meant to be used primarily as field or survival knives and use as a bayonet was a secondary consideration. They can also be used as throwing knives and have a built-in bottle opener in the crossguard. =France= The French use a more traditional spear point bayonet with the current FAMAS bayonet which is nearly identical to that of the M1949/56 bayonet.Bayonet Identification Guide. France The new French H&K; 416F rifle uses the Eickhorn \\"SG 2000 WC-F\\" a \\"tant≈ç\\"-style multi-purpose combat knife/bayonet (similar to the KM2000) with a wire cutter.

Linguistic impact The push-twist motion of fastening the older type of bayonet has given a name to: *The \\"bayonet mount\\" used for various types of quick fastenings, such as camera lenses, also called a \\"bayonet connector\\" when used in electrical plugs. *Several connectors and contacts including the bayonet- fitting light bulb that is common in the UK (as opposed to the continental European screw-fitting type). *One type of connector for foil and sabre weapons used in modern fencing competitions is referred to as a \\"bayonet\\" connector. In chess, an aggressive variation of the King's Indian Defence is known as the \\"Bayonet Attack\\". The bayonet has become a symbol of military power. The term \\"at the point of a bayonet\\" refers to using military force or action to accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. Bayonet Constitution). Undertaking a task \\"with fixed bayonets\\" has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics. Badges and insignias The Australian Army 'Rising Sun' badge features a semicircle of bayonets. The Australian Army Infantry Combat Badge (ICB) takes the form of a vertically mounted Australian Army SLR (7.62mm self-loading rifle FN FAL) bayonet surrounded by an oval-shaped laurel wreath.Infantry combat badge The US Army Combat Action Badge, awarded to personnel who have come under fire since 2001 and who are not eligible for the Combat Infantryman Badge (due to the fact that only Infantry personnel may be awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge), has a bayonet as its central motif. The shoulder sleeve insignia for the 10th Mountain Division in the US Army features crossed bayonets. The US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team's shoulder patch features a bayonet wrapped in a wing, symbolizing their airborne status. The brigade regularly deploys in task forces under the name \\"Bayonet\\". The insignia of the British Army's School of Infantry is an SA80 bayonet against a red shield. It is worn as a Tactical recognition flash (TRF) by instructors at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick, the Infantry Battle School at Brecon and the Support Weapons School in Warminster. The vocation tab collar insignia for the Singapore Armed Forces Infantry Formation utilizes two crossed bayonets. The bayonet is often used as a symbol of the Infantry in Singapore.

It was only the third national park established by the U.S., following Yellowstone in 1872 and Mackinac National Park in 1875. Sequoia was created at the same time, and Yosemite shortly thereafter. In 1933, Rock Creek Park became part of the newly formed National Capital Parks unit of the National Park Service. The Rock Creek Park Act authorized the purchase of no more than of land, extending north from Klingle Ford Bridge in the District of Columbia (approximately the northern limit of the National Zoo), to be \\"perpetually dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States\\".NPS (March 2010). \\"Rock Creek Park Long Range Interpretive Plan.\\" The Act also called for regulations to \\"provide for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber, animals, or curiosities within said park, and their retention in their natural condition, as nearly as possible\\".NPS (1985). \\"Success.\\" An Administrative History, Rock Creek Park. Rock Creek Park is the oldest natural urban park in the National Park System.\\"Our Wild Heart ‚Äì A Tribute to Rock Creek Park\\", Washington Post, July 11, 2014 Park construction began in 1897. In 1913, Congress authorized creation of the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway and extended the park along a narrow corridor from the zoo to the mouth of Rock Creek at the Potomac River.NPS (2004). \\"Parkway and Other Additions.\\" Rock Creek Park: An Administrative History. The parkway is a major traffic thoroughfare, especially along the portion south of the zoo. The park is patrolled by the United States Park Police.  Description  Rock Creek Park, Washington, D.C. Rock Creek Nature Center and Planetarium Beach Drive in the autumn The main section of the park comprises 1754 acres (2.74 mi2, 7.10 km2), along the Rock Creek Valley. Including the other green areas the park administers (Glover Archbold Park, Montrose Park, Dumbarton Oaks Park, Meridian Hill Park, Battery Kemble Park, Palisades Park, Whitehaven Park, etc.), it encompasses more than 2000 acres (3 mi2, 8 km2). The parklands follow the course of Rock Creek across the D.C.-Maryland border to connect with Rock Creek Stream Valley Park and Rock Creek Regional Park in Montgomery County. The Maryland parks are operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. The Rock Creek Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 23, 1991.Record display, National Register of Historic Places Recreation facilities include a golf course; equestrian trails; sport venues, including a tennis stadium which hosts major professional events; a nature center and planetarium; the Carter Barron Amphitheatre, an outdoor concert venue; and picnic and playground facilities. Rock Creek Park also maintains cultural exhibits, including the Peirce Mill. Rock Creek is a popular venue for jogging, cycling, and inline skating, especially on the long, winding Beach Drive, portions of which are closed to vehicles on weekends. A number of the city's outstanding bridges, such as the Lauzun's Legion, Dumbarton, Taft and the Duke Ellington bridges, span the creek and ravine. Among the park's few monuments is a pink granite bench on Beach Drive south of the Peirce Mill, dedicated on November 7, 1936 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in memory of former French ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand.* NPS. \\"Rock Creek Park: Monuments, Statues and Memorials\\". 2013-01-05 In 2014, it was named \\"best obscure memorial\\" by Washington City Paper. = Horse Center = Rock Creek Park Horse Center, founded in 1972, is located in the middle of the park near the Nature Center. The barn, run by Guest Services Inc, has 57 stalls, two outdoor rings, one indoor ring, and three bluestone turnout paddocks. The stable provides trail rides, pony rides, and lessons for the public, along with boarding for private horses. The stable primarily teaches English riding, with an emphasis on lower-level jumping and dressage. The barn is also home to Rock Creek Riders, a therapeutic riding program for adults and children with special needs in the D.C. area. Past participants in the program include brain-injured veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and people with autism, cerebral palsy, or attention deficit disorder. The program is volunteer-run and relies on donations and contributions for funding. Previously, Rock Creek Riders has worked with the United States Mounted Police, National Park Service, Wounded Warrior Project, and the Caisson Platoon Equine Assisted Programs to provide these therapeutic riding services. The horse center's summer camps are popular with D.C. residents. The stable offers summer camp from 9‚Äì3 for children over eight, and a two-hour afternoon camp for children between five and eight years old. The stable also recently implemented a summer CIT training program for teenagers. = Peirce Mill = Peirce Mill Peirce Mill is a water-powered grist mill in Rock Creek Park. There were at least eight mills along Rock Creek within what is now Washington, D.C., and many more farther upstream in Montgomery County, Maryland. Of those eight, only Peirce Mill is still standing. It was built in the 1820s by Isaac Peirce, along with a house, barn, and other buildings. It was later owned by a son, Joshua Peirce, and a nephew Peirce Shoemaker. It became part of Rock Creek Park in 1892.NPS (2004). \\"Under Military Rule: Peirce Mill.\\" Rock Creek Park: An Administrative History. The mill was listed on the National Register in 1969 as Peirce Mill. It was repaired and re-opened October 15, 2011. The Peirce Carriage Barn, adjacent to the mill, usually is open every day. The barn is the National Park Service point of contact. The barn was part of the Peirce estate built in 1810 and used as a tack room and carriage barn. The barn is now a mini-museum containing information on the milling process, the Peirce family estate and other mills along the Rock Creek Valley. = Rock Creek multi-use trails = A set of hiker/biker trails in the park serve both commuters and recreational users. The mainline trail extends for about from Broad Branch Road to the southern end of the Park where the trail continues several miles to Arlington Memorial Bridge and Hains Point. The northern trails, consist of a loop along Bingham, Oregon, Beach and Military Roads with spurs along Oregon to the Nature Center and Wise Road. In the Park, the mainline trail starts at the parking lot just west of the creek and south of Broad Branch. From there, it is co-located with a section of the Western Ridge Trail south past Pierce Mill to a trail bridge over the creek, where the two separate. After a short distance on the east side of the creek, it crosses back to the west side on Bluff Bridge. Dating back to 1934, it is the oldest part of the trail in the park, and the same age as the Devil's Chair and Saddle Club Bridges farther south. The trail remains on the west side until just south of Klingle Bridge where it crosses back to the east and leaves the park to enter the Zoo property. The Park Service began to experiment with trails in August 1963 when mile-long Ross Drive was closed to cars from 6 am to noon on Sundays, but planning for a separate trail system didn't begin until 1965, when the federal \\"Trails for America\\" report identified a trail along Rock Creek as one of many trails for the D.C. area. That same year, the \\"Fort Park System, A Re- evaluation Study of Fort Drive, Washington, D.C.\\" report suggested running the Circle Fort Trail through the park. Planning for trails led to action. In January 1967, NPS announced weekend road closures in April over a 5-mile loop in the center of the park, made up of Beach, Ross, Ridge and Joyce and they announced a plan to build a trail from Military Road to the District boundary. That trail, the first hiker-biker trail in the park, was built in the summer of 1967. The crushed bluestone trail was constructed from the Nature Center, past Wise Road to a turnaround loop just southwest of Beach Drive and the D.C. boundary. Over the next few months, NPS announced plans to add additional unpaved trails along Military Road from Oregon to Beach, along Wise to Fenwick Branch, beside Fenwick Branch to the District boundary and through Pinehurst Parkway Park (most of which were never constructed). In 1968, they built a second trail along Beach from Joyce to Bingham. By 1969, the two existing northern trails were connected with a trail along Bingham from Oregon to Beach. Later that year, NPS built the final section of the loop along Military between Oregon and Beach. By 1972, NPS had paved all of these trails except the section north of Wise to the DC Boundary. The section along Military Road was originally intended to serve as part of the Fort Circle Trail, passing by Fort DeRussy, but work on the Fort Circle Trail ended in the 1970s with only three parts, the one in Rock Creek, a section of the C&O; Canal towpath and another from Fort Stanton to Fort Mahon, completed. Over time, the Rock Creek section ceased to be viewed as part of the Fort Circle Trail system. Between 1979 and 1981, the unpaved trail and turnaround loop north of Wise was abandoned. Farther south, a trail along the creek was extended into the park in 1972. A trail along the Potomac built prior to 1967 was extended along the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway in 1971 and then into the park in 1972. It was built on a bridle path that dated back to the early 20th century up to the Bluff Bridge, which was built in 1934. The section of bridle path used between P and Q streets was built in conjunction with the Pentagon, as that project needed dirt and the park service needed dirt removed. These first sections of trail were 4 to 8 feet wide with rough pavement, steep slopes, poor visibility and sharp curves. By 1977, the trail was extended to Broad Branch Road, crossing the creek at Bluff Bridge and twice on newly constructed \\"breakaway\\" bridges. NPS and cyclists have long sought a way to close the gap on the north end of the park. After a 1973 proposal to extend the trail, NPS launched a study and announced a plan to do so in 1983, but quickly retracted it. In 1980, NPS, inspired by road closures in New York's Central Park, prepared an assessment of alternatives for a Bicycle Trail Study of the park that analyzed nine alternatives for completing the trail system, including construction of a new bike trail and alteration of the existing road network. After a period of public comment, NPS proposed expanding the weekend closure; constructing an additional of trail, designating Beach Drive north of Bingham a bicycle route and studying the suitability of a trail in that section. After years of additional study, public hearings and trial closures, NPS announced in February 1983 a plan to expand weekend closures and close Beach between Joyce and Broad Branch to automobile traffic. At first only one lane of Beach would be closed during rush hour, but after Metro's Red Line opened in Montgomery County in 1985, the section would be permanently closed. Six months later, under pressure from The American Automobile Association and the governments of D.C. and Montgomery County, the park service decided not to close the section of Beach. Instead, they decided to go ahead with the weekend closures and build a bicycle trail along a horse trail between Joyce and Broad Branch by 1986. But that trail was never built. In 1982, the Park Service built two new bridges for the trail. One bridge across Rock Creek between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street was built in conjunction with the roadway bridge reconstruction. Prior to the project, the trail used a narrow section of the existing bridge. That same year one of the two low-water breakaway bridges, just south of Pierce Mill, that was washed away by Hurricane David in 1979 was replaced with a high water bridge.Based on the engraving on the upstream side of the bridge. By 1990, biking on foot trails or bridle paths was no longer allowed. In 1991, the trail bridge beneath Porter Road, the other low-water breakaway bridge built in the 1970s, was replaced with a high-water bridge. The prospect of completing a bike route across the park re-emerged in the 1990s when the Park was required to come up with a General Management Plan. In 1991, a loosely knit, cyclist-dominated group called \\"Auto-Free D.C.\\" renewed the push to ban automobile traffic on Beach Drive. They suggested limited road closures to discourage commuters, but allow access to most locations in the park by car. When NPS failed to take up their suggestion, the group led a series of \\"rolling road block\\" protests which aimed to peaceably draw attention to the cause by disrupting rush hour traffic. Nonetheless, the protests led to some confrontations and arrests, and at one point the Military Road Bridge was graffitied with anti-automobile slogans. In 1996, NPS initiated a federally-mandated General Management Plan for the park. In June 1997, NPS laid out several management alternatives, one of which would improve and expand the paved multi-use trails and add a new trail along Wise, with the police substation converted to a visitor center and bicycle rental facility. Another alternative suggested that sections of Beach Drive be permanently closed and converted into a wide multi-use trail and that Wise Road, Sherrill Drive, Bingham Drive, Grant Road, and Blagden Avenue be converted to paved trails. Both of these alternatives were less popular than the status quo. An additional alternative created by the People's Alliance for Rock Creek (PARC), a group consisting of the Washington Area Bicyclists Association, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth and 18 other advocacy groups, suggested making Beach Drive auto-free north of Broad Branch as a means of completing the trail envisioned in 1965. In 2003, in an attempt to appease both groups, the Park Service proposed extending the weekend closures of Beach Drive to weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The proposal was one of several, but was the \\"preferred alternative.\\" The plan had popular support, but no political support. Mayor Anthony Williams who had supported closure as a candidate, opposed it as mayor, citing the need to evacuate in a post-9/11 world. In May 2004, NPS proposed instead to only close the section from Joyce to Broad Branch, but again found opposition among politicians. So, in November 2005, the Park Service finalized their management plan which included no further road closures, the prospect of lowering speed limits and adding speed bumps, and improvements to the trail south of Broad Branch. However, speed limits were never reduced and no traffic calming was ever implemented. The management plan completion cleared the way for the Park Service and DDOT to rebuild Beach Drive and the trail. Despite planning that started in 2005, work on the project didn't begin until September 22, 2016. The project rebuilt both Beach Drive and the trail. The trail section between Shoreham Drive and Broad Branch was widened to , repaved and realigned; the Shoreham Drive crossing, reworked in 2006, was again improved; the traffic lanes in the Zoo Tunnel were narrowed to widen the trail through it by ; a new access to Harvard Street was built and of new trail was constructed between the Porter Street Bridge and Bluff Bridge. In conjunction with the project, the trail through the Klingle Road intersection was redesigned to connect to the new Klingle Valley Trail, which was built on the washed out section of Klingle Road and opened on June 24, 2017. The work on the trail south of Broad Branch was completed on January 8, 2018. Work on Beach Drive between Joyce and Bingham, which improved a short section of trail near the bridge over the creek was completed on September 27, 2019. In 2018, DDOT announced plans to rehabilitate and expand the trail within both Rock Creek Park and outside of it. Within Rock Creek Park, they will rehabilitate a section between Klingle Road and Bluff Bridge and a section on the west side of the creek south of Broad Branch Road. They will also build a new trail along Piney Ridge Road from Beach Drive to Arkansas Avenue. Though the 2005 D.C. bicycle plan only identified a need for \\"an improved bicycle connection\\" between Broad Branch and the Maryland Line, the 2013 MoveDC Multi-modal transportation plan includes a future trail on this section. Sections of park roads have been subject to weekly closures to motor vehicles since the 1960s, though the times and locations changed. After the 1963 closure experiment, another was attempted in 1967 on Beach between Joyce and Broad Branch on Sunday mornings, but the response was not positive and it was discontinued. In 1970, NPS tried again, closing of Beach, and part of Morrow, every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but was again discontinued due to a lack of use. But, in 1972, NPS tried for a fourth time, again closing Beach between Broad Branch and Joyce from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and it became a permanent feature. On more than one occasion in the 1970s they experimented with Saturday closures in the summer, once to support a new bicycle concession near Carter Barron, which generated no negative response, but also little use. By 1980, they added the section from Tilden to Piney Branch Road and expanded the hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and in August 1981, they expanded the closure to Saturdays and holidays as an experiment. In July 1982, the weekend automobile ban was extended to the section of Beach from Picnic Grove 10 to Wise, and between West Beach and the D.C. boundary. In August 1983 they made the closures, between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday, official policy as part of the scaled back 1983 Plan. In 1985, the hours were increased from 7 a.m. Saturday to 7 p.m. Sunday from early April to Veterans Day on upper Beach Drive and year-round between Joyce and Broad Branch roads. Finally, by 1998 the closures had expanded to include not just the three sections of Beach but also the entirety of Bingham and Sherril Drives within the park and last all year long.  Administration  As originally authorized by Congress, the park was governed by the Rock Creek Park Commission, comprising the Chief of Engineers of the Army, the engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia, and three presidential appointees. In 1933, the park, along with other National Capital Parks, was transferred to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service.NPS (2004). \\"Under the Park Service: The Changing of the Guard.\\" Rock Creek Park: An Administrative History.

Later, it could be used to mean \\"a group or regime which exerts undue influence within a society\\".Oxford English Dictionary: Def's 2a and 2b. Also, it could be used for the geopolitical and the cultural predominance of one country over others, from which was derived hegemonism, as in the idea that the Great Powers meant to establish European hegemony over Africa, Asia and Latin America. In cultural imperialism, the leader state dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. In international relations theory, hegemony denotes a situation of (i) great material asymmetry in favour of one state, that has (ii) enough military power to systematically defeat any potential contester in the system, (iii) controls the access to raw materials, natural resources, capital and markets, (iv) has competitive advantages in the production of value added goods, (v) generates an accepted ideology reflecting this status quo; and (vi) is functionally differentiated from other states in the system, being expected to provide certain public goods such as security, or commercial and financial stability. The Marxist theory of cultural hegemony, associated particularly with Antonio Gramsci, is the idea that the ruling class can manipulate the value system and mores of a society, so that their view becomes the world view (Weltanschauung): in Terry Eagleton's words, \\"Gramsci normally uses the word hegemony to mean the ways in which a governing power wins consent to its rule from those it subjugates\\".Terry Eagleton, Ideology: An Introduction (London: Verso, 1991).

In late 16th and 17th-century Holland, the Dutch Republic's mercantilist dominion was an early instance of commercial hegemony, made feasible with the development of wind power for the efficient production and delivery of goods and services.

In France, King Louis XIV (1638‚Äì1715) and (Emperor) Napoleon I (1799‚Äì1815) attempted French true hegemony via economic, cultural and military domination of most of Continental Europe.

Map of the British Empire (as of 1910). At its height, it was the largest empire in history. After the defeat and exile of Napoleon, hegemony largely passed to the British Empire, which became the largest empire in history, with Queen Victoria (1837‚Äì1901) ruling over one-quarter of the world's land and population at its zenith. Like the Dutch, the British Empire was primarily seaborne; many British possessions were located around the rim of the Indian Ocean, as well as numerous islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Britain also controlled the Indian subcontinent and large portions of Africa.Porter, A., The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume III: The Nineteenth Century, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 258. In Europe, Germany, rather than Britain, may have been the strongest power after 1871, but Samuel Newland writes: > Bismarck defined the road ahead as ‚Ä¶ no expansion, no push for hegemony in > Europe. Germany was to be the strongest power in Europe but without being a > hegemon. ‚Ä¶ His basic axioms were first, no conflict among major powers in > Central Europe; and second, German security without German hegemony.\\" = 20th century = The Soviet Union and the United States dominated world affairs during the Cold War The early 20th century, like the late 19th century was characterized by multiple Great Powers but no global hegemon. World War I strengthened the United States and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Both of these states' governments pursued policies to expand their regional spheres of influence, the US in Latin America and Japan in East Asia. France, the UK, Italy, the Soviet Union and later Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì1945) all either maintained imperialist policies based on spheres of influence or attempted to conquer territory but none achieved the status of a global hegemonic power. After the Second World War, the United Nations was established and the five strongest global powers (China, France, the UK, the US, and the USSR) were given permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, the organization's most powerful decision making body. Following the war, the US and the USSR were the two strongest global powers and this created a bi-polar power dynamic in international affairs, commonly referred to as the Cold War. The hegemonic conflict was ideological, between communism and capitalism, as well as geopolitical, between the Warsaw Pact countries (1955‚Äì1991) and NATO/SEATO/CENTO countries (1949‚Äìpresent). During the Cold War both hegemons competed against each other directly (during the arms race) and indirectly (via proxy wars). The result was that many countries, no matter how remote, were drawn into the conflict when it was suspected that their governments' policies might destabilize the balance of power. Reinhard Hildebrandt calls this a period of \\"dual-hegemony\\", where \\"two dominant states have been stabilizing their European spheres of influence against and alongside each other.\\"Hilderbrandt, R., US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe, Peter Lang, 2009, p. 14. (Author's italics). Proxy wars became battle grounds between forces supported either directly or indirectly by the hegemonic powers and included the Korean War, the Laotian Civil War, the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, the Vietnam War, the Afghan War, the Angolan Civil War, and the Central American Civil Wars.Mumford, A., Proxy Warfare, John Wiley & Sons, 2013, pp. 46‚Äì51. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 the United States was the world's sole hegemonic power.Hildebrandt, R., US Hegemony: Global Ambitions and Decline : Emergence of the Interregional Asian Triangle and the Relegation of the US as a Hegemonic Power, the Reorientation of Europe, Peter Lang, 2009, pp. 9‚Äì11. = 21st century = A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to SIPRI. Various perspectives on whether the US was or continues to be a hegemon have been presented since the end of the Cold War. The American political scientists John Mearsheimer and Joseph Nye have argued that the US is not a true hegemon because it has neither the financial nor the military resources to impose a proper, formal, global hegemony. On the other hand, Anna Cornelia Beyer, in her book about counter-terrorism, argues that global governance is a product of American leadership and describes it as hegemonic governance. Within NATO, moreover, the United States remains a dispensable hegemonic force, as seen in the decline in the alliance's external value profile.NATO's Democratic Retrenchment: Hegemony After the Return of History The French Socialist politician Hubert V√©drine in 1999 described the US as a hegemonic hyperpower, because of its unilateral military actions worldwide.Reid, JIM., Religion and Global Culture: New Terrain in the Study of Religion and the Work of Charles H. Long, Lexington Books, 2004, p. 82. Pentagon strategist Edward Luttwak, in The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire,The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century AD to the Third, (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976). outlined three stages, with hegemonic being the first, followed by imperial. In his view the transformation proved to be fatal and eventually led to the fall of the Roman Empire. His book gives implicit advice to Washington to continue the present hegemonic strategy and refrain from establishing an empire. In 2006, author Zhu Zhiqun claimed that China is already on the way to becoming the world hegemon and that the focus should be on how a peaceful transfer of power can be achieved between the US and China, but has faced opposition to this claim. According to the recent study published in 2019, the authors argued that a \\"third‚Äêway hegemony\\" or Dutch‚Äêstyle hegemony apart from a peaceful or violent hegemonic rise may be the most feasible option to describe China in its global hegemony in the future.  Political science  NATO countries account for over 70% of global military expenditure, with the United States alone accounting for 43% of global military expenditure in 2009. Antonio Gramsci (1891‚Äì1937), the theoretician of cultural hegemony In the historical writing of the 19th century, the denotation of hegemony extended to describe the predominance of one country upon other countries; and, by extension, hegemonism denoted the Great Power politics (c. 1880s ‚Äì 1914) for establishing hegemony (indirect imperial rule), that then leads to a definition of imperialism (direct foreign rule). In the early 20th century, in the field of international relations, the Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci developed the theory of cultural domination (an analysis of economic class) to include social class; hence, the philosophic and sociologic theory of cultural hegemony analysed the social norms that established the social structures (social and economic classes) with which the ruling class establish and exert cultural dominance to impose their Weltanschauung (world view)‚Äîjustifying the social, political, and economic status quo‚Äîas natural, inevitable, and beneficial to every social class, rather than as artificial social constructs beneficial solely to the ruling class. From the Gramsci analysis derived the political science denotation of hegemony as leadership; thus, the historical example of Prussia as the militarily and culturally predominant province of the German Empire (Second Reich 1871‚Äì1918); and the personal and intellectual predominance of Napoleon Bonaparte upon the French Consulate (1799‚Äì1804). Contemporarily, in Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (1985), Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe defined hegemony as a political relationship of power wherein a sub-ordinate society (collectivity) perform social tasks that are culturally unnatural and not beneficial to them, but that are in exclusive benefit to the imperial interests of the hegemon, the superior, ordinate power; hegemony is a military, political, and economic relationship that occurs as an articulation within political discourse. Beyer analysed the contemporary hegemony of the United States at the example of the Global War on Terrorism and presented the mechanisms and processes of American exercise of power in 'hegemonic governance'.  Sociology  Academics have argued that in the praxis of hegemony, imperial dominance is established by means of cultural imperialism, whereby the leader state (hegemon) dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The imposition of the hegemon's way of life‚Äîan imperial lingua franca and bureaucracies (social, economic, educational, governing)‚Äîtransforms the concrete imperialism of direct military domination into the abstract power of the status quo, indirect imperial domination.Bush, B., Imperialism and Postcolonialism, Routledge, 2014, p. 123. Critics have said that this view is \\"deeply condescending\\" and \\"treats people ... as blank slates on which global capitalism's moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on.\\"Brutt-Griffler, J., in Karlfried Knapp, Barbara Seidlhofer, H. G. Widdowson, Handbook of Foreign Language Communication and Learning, Walter de Gruyter, 2009, p. 264. Culturally, hegemony also is established by means of language, specifically the imposed lingua franca of the hegemon (leader state), which then is the official source of information for the people of the society of the sub- ordinate state. Writing on language and power, Andrea Mayr says, \\"As a practice of power, hegemony operates largely through language.\\"Mayr, A., Language and Power: An Introduction to Institutional Discourse, A&C; Black, 2008, p. 14. In contemporary society, an example of the use of language in this way is in the way Western countries set up educational systems in African countries mediated by Western languages.Clayton, T., Rethinking Hegemony, James Nicholas Publishers, 2006, pp. 202‚Äì03. Suggested examples of cultural imperialism include the latter-stage Spanish and British Empires, the 19th- and 20th-century Reichs of unified Germany (1871‚Äì1945), As well as p. 145: \\"Unified Germany was achieving the strength to dominate Europe all by itself‚Äîan occurrence which Great Britain had always resisted in the past when it came about by conquest\\". and by the end of the 20th century, the United States.

In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as :a^p \\\\equiv a \\\\pmod p. For example, if = 2 and = 7, then 27 = 128, and 128 ‚àí 2 = 126 = 7 √ó 18 is an integer multiple of 7. If is not divisible by , Fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that is an integer multiple of , or in symbols:.. :a^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod p. For example, if = 2 and = 7, then 26 = 64, and 64 ‚àí 1 = 63 = 7 √ó 9 is thus a multiple of 7. Fermat's little theorem is the basis for the Fermat primality test and is one of the fundamental results of elementary number theory. The theorem is named after Pierre de Fermat, who stated it in 1640. It is called the \\"little theorem\\" to distinguish it from Fermat's last theorem.. History Pierre de Fermat Pierre de Fermat first stated the theorem in a letter dated October 18, 1640, to his friend and confidant Fr√©nicle de Bessy. His formulation is equivalent to the following: > If is a prime and is any integer not divisible by , then is divisible by . Fermat's original statement was > This may be translated, with explanations and formulas added in brackets for > easier understanding, as: > Every prime number [] divides necessarily one of the powers minus one of any > [geometric] progression [] [that is, there exists such that divides ], and > the exponent of this power [] divides the given prime minus one [divides ]. > After one has found the first power [] that satisfies the question, all > those whose exponents are multiples of the exponent of the first one satisfy > similarly the question [that is, all multiples of the first have the same > property]. Fermat did not consider the case where is a multiple of nor prove his assertion, only stating: (in French) > > (And this proposition is generally true for all series [sic] and for all > prime numbers; I would send you a demonstration of it, if I did not fear > going on for too long.) for the English translation Euler provided the first published proof in 1736, in a paper titled \\"Theorematum Quorundam ad Numeros Primos Spectantium Demonstratio\\" in the Proceedings of the St. Petersburg Academy, but Leibniz had given virtually the same proof in an unpublished manuscript from sometime before 1683. The term \\"Fermat's little theorem\\" was probably first used in print in 1913 in Zahlentheorie by Kurt Hensel: > > (There is a fundamental theorem holding in every finite group, usually > called Fermat's little theorem because Fermat was the first to have proved a > very special part of it.) An early use in English occurs in A.A. Albert's Modern Higher Algebra (1937), which refers to \\"the so-called 'little' Fermat theorem\\" on page 206. =Further history= Some mathematicians independently made the related hypothesis (sometimes incorrectly called the Chinese Hypothesis) that if and only if is prime. Indeed, the \\"if\\" part is true, and it is a special case of Fermat's little theorem. However, the \\"only if\\" part is false: For example, , but 341 = 11 √ó 31 is a pseudoprime. See below. Proofs Several proofs of Fermat's little theorem are known. It is frequently proved as a corollary of Euler's theorem. Generalizations Euler's theorem is a generalization of Fermat's little theorem: for any modulus n and any integer coprime to , one has : a^{\\\\varphi (n)} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod n, where \\\\varphi(n) denotes Euler's totient function (which counts the integers from 1 to that are coprime to ). Fermat's little theorem is indeed a special case, because if n is a prime number, then \\\\varphi(n)=n-1. A corollary of Euler's theorem is: for every positive integer , if the integer is coprime with then :x \\\\equiv y \\\\pmod{\\\\varphi(n)}\\\\quad\\\\text{implies}\\\\quad a^x \\\\equiv a^y \\\\pmod n, for any integers and . This follows from Euler's theorem, since, if x \\\\equiv y \\\\pmod{\\\\varphi(n)}, then x=y+k\\\\varphi(n) for some integer , and one has :a^x = a^{y + \\\\varphi(n)k} = a^y (a^{\\\\varphi(n)})^k \\\\equiv a^y 1^k \\\\equiv a^y \\\\pmod n. If is prime, this is also a corollary of Fermat's little theorem. This is widely used in modular arithmetic, because this allows reducing modular exponentiation with large exponents to exponents smaller than . If is not prime, this is used in public-key cryptography, typically in the RSA cryptosystem in the following way: if :y=x^e\\\\pmod n, retrieving from the values of and is easy if one knows \\\\varphi(n). In fact, the extended Euclidean algorithm allows computing the modular inverse of modulo \\\\varphi(n), that is the integer such ef\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod{\\\\varphi(n)}. It follows that :x\\\\equiv x^{ef}\\\\equiv (x^e)^f \\\\equiv y^f\\\\pmod n. On the other hand, if is the product of two distinct prime numbers, then \\\\varphi(n)=(p-1)(q-1). In this case, finding from and needs knowing \\\\varphi(n) (this is not proved, but no algorithm is known for computing without knowing \\\\varphi(n)). If one knows and \\\\varphi(n), the factors and are easy to deduce, as one knows their product and their sum n-\\\\varphi(n)+1. The basic idea of RSA cryptosystem is thus: if a message is encrypted as y=x^e\\\\pmod n, using public values of and , then, with the current knowledge, it cannot be decrypted without finding the (secret) factors and of . Fermat's little theorem is also related to the Carmichael function and Carmichael's theorem, as well as to Lagrange's theorem in group theory. Converse The converse of Fermat's little theorem is not generally true, as it fails for Carmichael numbers. However, a slightly stronger form of the theorem is true, and it is known as Lehmer's theorem. The theorem is as follows: If there exists an integer such that : a^{p-1}\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod p and for all primes dividing one has : a^{(p-1)/q} ot\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod p, then is prime. This theorem forms the basis for the Lucas‚ÄìLehmer test, an important primality test. Pseudoprimes If and are coprime numbers such that is divisible by , then need not be prime. If it is not, then is called a (Fermat) pseudoprime to base . The first pseudoprime to base 2 was found in 1820 by Pierre Fr√©d√©ric Sarrus: 341 = 11 √ó 31. A number that is a Fermat pseudoprime to base for every number coprime to is called a Carmichael number (e.g. 561). Alternately, any number satisfying the equality :\\\\gcd\\\\left(p, \\\\sum_{a=1}^{p-1} a^{p-1}\\\\right)=1 is either a prime or a Carmichael number. Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test The Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test uses the following extension of Fermat's little theorem: > If is an odd prime number, and , with odd, then for every prime to , either > , or there exists such that and This result may be deduced from Fermat's little theorem by the fact that, if is an odd prime, then the integers modulo form a finite field, in which has exactly two square roots, 1 and ‚àí1. The Miller‚ÄìRabin test uses this property in the following way: given , with odd, an odd integer for which primality has to be tested, choose randomly such that ; then compute ; if is not 1 nor ‚àí1, then square it repeatedly modulo until you get 1, ‚àí1, or have squared times. If and ‚àí1 has not been obtained, then is not prime. Otherwise, may be prime or not. If is not prime, the probability that this is proved by the test is higher than 1/4. Therefore, after non-conclusive random tests, the probability that is not prime is lower than , and may thus be made as low as desired, by increasing . In summary, the test either proves that a number is not prime, or asserts that it is prime with a probability of error that may be chosen as low as desired. The test is very simple to implement and computationally more efficient than all known deterministic tests. Therefore, it is generally used before starting a proof of primality.

In mathematics, Minkowski's theorem is the statement that every convex set in \\\\mathbb{R}^n which is symmetric with respect to the origin and which has volume greater than 2^n contains a non-zero integer point. The theorem was proved by Hermann Minkowski in 1889 and became the foundation of the branch of number theory called the geometry of numbers. It can be extended from the integers to any lattice L and to any symmetric convex set with volume greater than 2^n\\\\,d(L), where d(L) denotes the covolume of the lattice (the absolute value of the determinant of any of its bases). Formulation Suppose that is a lattice of determinant in the -dimensional real vector space and is a convex subset of that is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning that if is in then is also in . Minkowski's theorem states that if the volume of is strictly greater than , then must contain at least one lattice point other than the origin. (Since the set is symmetric, it would then contain at least three lattice points: the origin 0 and a pair of points , where .) Example The simplest example of a lattice is the integer lattice of all points with integer coefficients; its determinant is 1. For , the theorem claims that a convex figure in the Euclidean plane symmetric about the origin and with area greater than 4 encloses at least one lattice point in addition to the origin. The area bound is sharp: if is the interior of the square with vertices then is symmetric and convex, and has area 4, but the only lattice point it contains is the origin. This example, showing that the bound of the theorem is sharp, generalizes to hypercubes in every dimension . Proof The following argument proves Minkowski's theorem for the specific case of . Proof of the \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 case: Consider the map :f: S \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^2/2L, \\\\qquad (x,y) \\\\mapsto (x \\\\bmod 2, y \\\\bmod 2) Intuitively, this map cuts the plane into 2 by 2 squares, then stacks the squares on top of each other. Clearly has area less than or equal to 4, because this set lies within a 2 by 2 square. Assume for a contradiction that could be injective, which means the pieces of cut out by the squares stack up in a non-overlapping way. Because is locally area- preserving, this non-overlapping property would make it area-preserving for all of , so the area of would be the same as that of , which is greater than 4. That is not the case, so the assumption must be false: is not injective, meaning that there exist at least two distinct points in that are mapped by to the same point: . Because of the way was defined, the only way that can equal is for to equal for some integers and , not both zero. That is, the coordinates of the two points differ by two even integers. Since is symmetric about the origin, is also a point in . Since is convex, the line segment between and lies entirely in , and in particular the midpoint of that segment lies in . In other words, :\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left(-p_1 + p_2\\\\right) = \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\left(-p_1 + p_1 + (2i, 2j)\\\\right) = (i, j) is a point in . But this point is an integer point, and is not the origin since and are not both zero. Therefore, contains a nonzero integer point. Remarks: * The argument above proves the theorem that any set of volume > \\\\det(L) contains two distinct points that differ by a lattice vector. This is known as Blichfeld's theorem. * The argument above highlights that the term 2^n \\\\text{det}(L) is the covolume of the lattice 2 L . * To obtain a proof for general lattices, it suffices to prove Minkowski's theorem only for \\\\mathbb{Z}^n ; this is because every full-rank lattice can be written as B \\\\mathbb{Z}^n for some linear transformation B , and the properties of being convex and symmetric around the origin are preserved by linear transformations, while the covolume of B \\\\mathbb{Z}^n is \\\\text{det}(B)and volume of a body scales by exactly \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{det}(B)} under an application of B^{-1} . Applications =Bounding the Shortest Vector= Minkowski's theorem implies gives an upper bound for the length of the shortest nonzero vector. This result has applications in lattice cryptography and number theory. Theorem (Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector): Let L be a lattice. Then there is a x \\\\in L \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} with x_{\\\\infty} \\\\leq \\\\det(L)^{1/n} . In particular, by the standard comparison between l_2 and l_{\\\\infty} norms, x_2 \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\det(L)^{1/n} . Proof: Let l = \\\\min \\\\\\\\{ x_{\\\\infty} : x \\\\in L \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} , and set C = \\\\\\\\{ y : y_{\\\\infty} < l \\\\\\\\} . Then \\\\text{vol}(C) = (2l)^n . If (2l)^n > 2^n d(L), then C contains a non-zero lattice point, which is a contradiction. Thus l \\\\leq d(L)^{1/n} . QED Remarks: * The constant in the L^2 bound can be improved, for instance by taking the open ball of radius < l as C in the above argument. The optimal constant is known as Hermite's constant. * The bound given by the theorem can be very loose, as can be seen by considering the lattice generated by (1,0), (0,n) . * Even though Minkowski's theorem guarantees a short lattice vector within a certain magnitude bound, finding this vector is in general a hard computational problem. Finding the vector within a factor guaranteed by Minkowski's bound is referred to as Minkowski's Vector Problem (MVP), and it is known that approximation SVP reduces to it using transference properties of the dual lattice. The computational problem is also sometimes referred to as HermiteSVP. * The LLL- basis reduction algorithm can be seen as a weak but efficiently algorithmic version of Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector. This is because a \\\\delta -LLL reduced basis b_1, \\\\ldots, b_n for L has the property that b_1\\\\leq (\\\\frac{1}{ \\\\delta - .25})^{\\\\frac{n-1}{4}} \\\\text{det}(L)^{1/n} ; see these lecture notes of Micciancio for more on this. As explained in , proofs of bounds on Hermite's constant contain some of the key ideas in the LLL- reduction algorithm. =Applications to number theory= Primes that are Sums of Two Squares The difficult implication in Fermat's theorem on the sum of two squares can be proven using Minkowski's bound on the shortest vector. Theorem: Every prime with p - 1 = 0 \\\\mod 4 can be written as a sum of two squares. Proof: Since 4 p - 1 , there is a square root of -1 in \\\\mathbb{Z}/p\\\\mathbb{Z} ; choose one and call one representative in \\\\mathbb{Z} for it j . Consider the lattice L defined by the vectors (1, j), (0,p) , and let B denote the associated matrix. The determinant of this lattice is p , whence Minkowski's bound tells us that there is a nonzero x = (x_1, x_2) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}^2 with 0 < Bx_2^2 < 2p . We have Bx^2 = ( x_1, jx_1 + px_2 )^2 = x_1^2 + (jx_1 + px_2)^2 and we define the integers a = x_1, b = (jx_1 + px_2) . Minkowski's bound tells us that 0 < a^2 + b^2 < 2p , and simple modular arithmetic shows that a^2 + b^2 = x_1^2 + (jx_1 + px_2)^2 = 0 \\\\mod p , and thus we conclude that a^2 + b^2 = p . QED Additionally, the lattice perspective gives a computationally efficient approach to Fermat's theorem on sums of squares: First, recall that finding any nonzero vector with norm less than 2p in L , the lattice of the proof, gives a decomposition of p as a sum of two squares. Such vectors can be found efficiently, for instance using LLL-algorithm. In particular, if b_1, b_2 is a 3/4 -LLL reduced basis, then, by the property that b_1\\\\leq ( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\delta - .25})^{\\\\frac{n-1}{4}} \\\\text{det}(B)^{1/n} , b_1^2 \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{2} p < 2p . Thus, by running the LLL-lattice basis reduction algorithm with \\\\delta = 3/4 , we obtain a decomposition of p as a sum of squares. Note that because every vector in L has norm squared a multiple of p , the vector returned by the LLL-algorithm in this case is in fact a shortest vector. Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem Minkowski's theorem is also useful to prove Lagrange's four-square theorem, which states that every natural number can be written as the sum of the squares of four natural numbers. Dirichlet's Theorem on Simultaneous Rational Approximation Minkowski's theorem can be used to prove Dirichlet's theorem on simultaneous rational approximation. Algebraic Number Theory Another application of Minkowski's theorem is the result that every class in the ideal class group of a number field contains an integral ideal of norm not exceeding a certain bound, depending on , called Minkowski's bound: the finiteness of the class number of an algebraic number field follows immediately. Complexity Theory The complexity of finding the point guaranteed by Minkowski's theorem, or the closely related Blitchfields theorem, have been studied from the perspective of TFNP search problems. In particular, it is known that a computational analogue of Blichfeldt's theorem, a corollary of the proof of Minkowski's theorem, is PPP- complete. It is also known that the computational analogue of Minkowski's theorem is in the class PPP, and it was conjectured to be PPP complete .

Examples Below are examples of all the properties of count nouns holding for the count noun chair, but not for the mass noun furniture. * Occurrence in plural. : There is a chair in the room. (correct) : There are chairs in the room. (correct) : There is chair in the room. (incorrect) : There is a furniture in the room. (incorrect) : There are furnitures in the room. (incorrect) : There is furniture in the room. (correct) * Co-occurrence with count determiners : Every chair is man made. : There are several chairs in the room. : Every furniture is man made. (incorrect) : There are several furnitures in the room. (incorrect) Some determiners can be used with both mass and count nouns, including \\"some\\", \\"a lot (of)\\", \\"no\\". Others cannot: \\"few\\" and \\"many\\" are used with count items, \\"little\\" and \\"much\\" with mass. (On the other hand, \\"fewer\\" is reserved for count and \\"less\\" for mass (see Fewer vs. less), but \\"more\\" is the proper comparative for both \\"many\\" and \\"much\\".) Grammatical distinction The concept of a \\"mass noun\\" is a grammatical concept and is not based on the innate nature of the object to which that noun refers. For example, \\"seven chairs\\" and \\"some furniture\\" could refer to exactly the same objects, with \\"seven chairs\\" referring to them as a collection of individual objects but with \\"some furniture\\" referring to them as a single undifferentiated unit. However, some abstract phenomena like \\"fun\\" and \\"hope\\" have properties which make it difficult to refer to them with a count noun. Classifiers are sometimes used as count nouns preceding mass nouns, in order to redirect the speaker's focus away from the mass nature. For example, \\"There's some furniture in the room\\" can be restated, with a change of focus, to \\"There are some pieces of furniture in the room\\"; and \\"let's have some fun\\" can be refocused as \\"Let's have a bit of fun\\". In English, some nouns are used most frequently as mass nouns, with or without a classifier (as in \\"Waiter, I'll have some coffee\\" or \\"Waiter, I'll have a cup of coffee\\"), but also, less frequently, as count nouns (as in \\"Waiter, we'll have three coffees.\\") Theory Following the work of logicians like Godehard Link and linguists like Manfred Krifka, we know that the mass/count distinction can be given a precise mathematical definition in terms of notions like cumulativity and quantization. Discussed by Barry Schein in 1993, a new logical framework, called plural logic, has also been used for characterizing the semantics of count nouns and mass nouns. Linguistic differences Some languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, treat all nouns as mass nouns, and need to make use of a noun classifier (see Chinese classifier) to add numerals and other quantifiers. The following examples are of nouns which, while seemingly innately countable, are still treated as mass nouns: *ÈÇ£‰∏™‰∫∫ÂêÉÂÆå‰∫Ü (n√† g√® r√©n chƒ´ w√°n le) ‚Äì \\"That unit (of) person has eaten\\", \\"That person has eaten\\" *ÈÇ£‰∏â‰∏™‰∫∫ÂêÉÂÆå‰∫Ü(n√† sƒÅn g√® r√©n chƒ´ w√°n le) ‚Äì \\"Those three unit (of) person' have eaten\\", \\"Those three people have eaten\\" *Â•πÊúâ‰∏ÉÊú¨‰π¶ (tƒÅ y≈èu qƒ´ bƒïn sh≈´) ‚Äì \\"She has seven volume (of) book\\", \\"She has seven books.\\" A classifier, therefore, implies that the object(s) referred to are countable in the sense that the speaker intends them to be enumerated, rather than considered as a unit (regardless of quantity). Notice that the classifier changes as the unit being counted changes. Words such as \\"milk\\" or \\"rice\\" are not so obviously countable entities, but they can be counted with an appropriate unit of measure in both English and Mandarin (e.g., \\"glasses of milk\\" or \\"spoonfuls of rice\\"). The use of a classifier is similar to, but not identical with, the use of units of measurement to count groups of objects in English. For example, in \\"three shelves of books\\", \\"shelves\\" is used as a unit of measurement. On the other hand, some languages like Turkish treats all the nouns, even the not so obviously countable entities as count nouns. * Pirin√ßler daha tam pi≈ümemi≈ü. ‚Äì \\"The rice (lit. rices) hasn't been cooked well yet\\" * S√ºtler hep yerlere d√∂k√ºld√º. ‚Äì \\"The milk (lit. milks) has been spilled all over the floor (lit. floors)\\" * Nehirlerin sularƒ± √ßok g√ºzel akƒ±yor. ‚Äì \\"The rivers' water (lit. waters) flows very nicely\\" * Parasƒ±z ki≈üiler i√ßin kitaplar daƒüƒ±tƒ±yorlar. ‚Äì \\"They are distributing books for the people without money\\" Even then, it's possible to use units of measures with numbers in Turkish, even with the very obviously countable nouns. Note that the Turkish nouns can't take a plural suffix after the numbers and the units of measure. * Be≈ü bardak s√ºt ‚Äì \\"five glasses of milk\\" * ƒ∞ki ka≈üƒ±k dolusu pirin√ß ‚Äì \\"two spoonfuls of rice\\" * √ú√ß tane ki≈üi ‚Äì \\"three units of person\\" * D√∂rt metrekare yer ‚Äì \\"Four square meters of floor\\" * Yedi raf kitap ‚Äì \\"seven shelves of book\\" See also *Collective noun *Grammatical number *Measure word References Nouns by type Grammatical number af:Telwoord ","title":"Count noun"},{"id":"53459","text":"Inayat Rehmat Khan Pathan () (5 July 1882 ‚Äì 5 February 1927) was the founder of the Sufi Order in the West in 1914 (London) and teacher of Universal Sufism. He initially came to the West as a Northern Indian classical musician, having received the honorific \\"Tansen\\" from the Nizam of Hyderabad, but he soon turned to the introduction and transmission of Sufi thought and practice. Later, in 1923, the Sufi Order of the London period was dissolved into a new organization, formed under Swiss law, called the \\"International Sufi Movement\\". His message of divine unity (Tawhid) focused on the themes of love, harmony, and beauty. He taught that blind adherence to any book rendered religion devoid of spirit. Branches of Inayat Khan's movement can be found in the Netherlands, France, England, Germany, the United States, Canada, Russia and Australia. In his various written works, such as the Music of Life and The Mysticism of Sound and Music, Inayat Khan interlocks his passion for music with his Sufi ideologies making an argument for music as the harmonious thread of the Universe.

The family settled in Suresnes near Paris. In 1922, during a summer school, Inayat Khan had a spiritual experience in the South Dunes in Katwijk, The Netherlands. He immediately told his students to meditate and proclaimed the place holy. In 1969 the Universal Sufi Temple was built there. Khan returned to India at the end of 1926 and there chose the site of his tomb, the Nizamuddin Dargah complex in Delhi where the founder of the Nizami Chishtiyya, Shaykh Nizamuddin Auliya (died 1325), is buried. Khan died shortly after, on 5 February 1927. =Foundational principles= Inayat Khan set forth ten principles that formed the foundational principles of his Universal Sufism:In The Spiritual Message of Inayat Khan, Volume I ‚Äì The Way of Illumination, VOLUME I ‚Äì I ‚Äì 1 at wahiduddin.net # There is one God(Allah); the Eternal, the Only Being; None exists save He. # There is one master; the guiding spirit of all souls that constantly leads all followers toward the light. # There is one holy book; the sacred manuscript of nature, the only Scripture that can enlighten the reader. # There is one religion; unswerving progress in the right direction toward the Ideal, which fulfills every soul's life purpose. # There is one law; the law of reciprocity, which can be observed by a selfless conscience, together with a sense of awakened justice. # There is one brotherhood; the human brotherhood which unites the children of earth indiscriminately in the fatherhood of God. This was later adapted by followers to; \\"There is one Family, the Human Family, which unites the Children of Earth indiscriminately in the Parenthood of God.\\" # There is one moral; the love which springs forth from self-denial and blooms in deeds of beneficence. ... (later alternative; \\"which springs forth from a willing heart, surrendered in service to God and Humanity, and which blooms in deeds of beneficence\\"). # There is one object of praise; the beauty which uplifts the heart of its worshipper through all aspects from the seen to the unseen. # There is one truth; true knowledge of our being, within and without, which is the essence of Wisdom. # There is one path; annihilation of the false ego in the real (later alternative; \\"the effacement of the limited self in the Unlimited\\"), which raises the mortal to immortality, in which resides all perfection. Inayat Khan's emphasis on spiritual liberty led many contemporary Westerners to think that his brand of Sufism is not inherently intertwined with Islam, although his followers continue to perform Zikr. There is a precedent of masters of the Chishti and some other orders not requiring non- Muslim followers to convert to Islam. The number of non-Muslim Sufis before the twentieth century, however, was usually relatively few.Carl Ernst and Bruce Lawrence, Sufi Martyrs of Love, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p.142. . Criticism SOE instructors investigating the family background of his daughter Noor had very negative things to say about Inayat Khan and saw his influence on his children as detrimental to them.Shrabani Basu in Spy Princess p. 92 Bibliography =Books= * Inayat Khan, Hazrat (Prof. 'InƒÅyat-khƒÅn flahmat-khƒÅn PathƒÅn).

Music Once a classical musician, Inayat Khan let go of his greatest attachment ‚Äì his musical career ‚Äì to become a Sufi Master, as is the tradition in Sufism. Immersing himself in the Sufi ideology, he found a link between his former life as a musician and his new journey along the spiritual path. Khan saw harmony as the \\"music of the spheres\\" which linked all mankind and had the ability to transcend one's spiritual awareness. Khan's most influential, The Music of Life, is a collection of Khan's teachings on sound, presenting his vision of the harmony which encompasses every aspect of our lives. He explores the science of breath, the law of rhythm, the creative process, and both the healing power and psychological influence of music and sound. From The Music of Life: > \\"What makes us feel drawn to music is that our whole being is music; our > mind and our body, the nature in which we live, the nature that has made us, > all that is beneath and around us, it is all music. We are close to all this > music, and live and move and have our being in music. The mystery of sound > is mysticism; the harmony of life is religion. The knowledge of vibrations > is metaphysics, the analysis of atoms is science, and their harmonious > grouping is art. The rhythm of form is poetry, and the rhythm of sound is > music. This shows that music is the art of arts and the science of all > sciences; and it contains the fountain of all knowledge within itself.\\" > \\"Music should be healing; music should uplift the soul; music should > inspire. There is no better way of getting closer to God, of rising higher > towards the spirit, of attaining spiritual perfection than music, if only it > is rightly understood.\\" Some of Khan's music during his years as an Indian classical musician (not associated with Sufi music, the religious music associated with Sufism) is available online.¬´Hindustani songs by prof.

It is the most common source ore for refining elemental mercury, and is the historic source for the brilliant red or scarlet pigment termed vermilion and associated red mercury pigments. Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with recent volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs. The mineral resembles quartz in symmetry and in its exhibiting birefringence. Cinnabar has a mean refractive index near 3.2, a hardness between 2.0 and 2.5, and a specific gravity of approximately 8.1. The color and properties derive from a structure that is a hexagonal crystalline lattice belonging to the trigonal crystal system, crystals that sometimes exhibit twinning. Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East, including as a rouge-type cosmetic, in the New World since the Olmec culture, and in China since as early as the Yangshao culture, where it was used in coloring stoneware. Associated modern precautions for use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component, which was recognized as early as ancient Rome.  Etymology  The name comes from (), a Greek word most likely applied by Theophrastus to several distinct substances. Other sources say the word comes from the (Arabicized as ), a word of uncertain origin. In Latin, it was sometimes known as minium, meaning also \\"red cinnamon\\", though both of these terms now refer specifically to lead tetroxide.  Properties and structure  = Properties = Cinnabar is generally found in a massive, granular or earthy form and is bright scarlet to brick-red in color, though it occasionally occurs in crystals with a nonmetallic adamantine luster. It resembles quartz in its symmetry. It exhibits birefringence, and it has the second highest refractive index of any mineral. Its mean refractive index is 3.08 (sodium light wavelengths), versus the indices for diamond and the non- mineral gallium(III) arsenide (GaAs), which are 2.42 and 3.93, respectively. The hardness of cinnabar is 2.0‚Äì2.5 on the Mohs scale, and its specific gravity 8.1. = Structure = Crystal structure of cinnabar: yellow = sulfur, grey = mercury, green = cell Structurally, cinnabar belongs to the trigonal crystal system. It occurs as thick tabular or slender prismatic crystals or as granular to massive incrustations. Crystal twinning occurs as simple contact twins. Note, mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, adopts the cinnabar structure described, and one additional structure, i.e. it is dimorphous. Cinnabar is the more stable form, and is a structure akin to that of HgO: each Hg center has two short Hg‚àíS bonds (each 2.36 √Ö), and four longer contacts (with 3.10, 3.10, 3.30, and 3.30 √Ö separations). In addition, HgS is found in a black, non-cinnabar polymorph (metacinnabar) that has the zincblende structure.  Occurrence  Cinnabar mercury ore from Nevada, United States Cinnabar generally occurs as a vein-filling mineral associated with recent volcanic activity and alkaline hot springs. Cinnabar is deposited by epithermal ascending aqueous solutions (those near surface and not too hot) far removed from their igneous source. It is associated with native mercury, stibnite, realgar, pyrite, marcasite, opal, quartz, chalcedony, dolomite, calcite and barite. Cinnabar is essentially found in all mineral extraction localities that yield mercury, notably Almad√©n (Spain). This mine was exploited from Roman times until 1991, being for centuries the most important cinnabar deposit in the world. Good cinnabar crystals have also been found there. Cinnabar deposits also appear in Giza (Egypt); Puerto Princesa (Philippines); New Almaden (California); Hastings Mine and St. John's Mine, Vallejo, California (United States); Idrija (Slovenia); New Idria, California (United States); near Obermoschel in the Palatinate; La Ripa, at the foot of the Apuan Alps and in the Mount Amiata (Tuscany, Italy); the mountain Avala (Serbia); Huancavelica (Peru); Murfreesboro, Arkansas (United States); Terlingua, Texas (United States); and the province of Guizhou in China, where fine crystals have been obtained. It was also mined near Red Devil, Alaska on the middle Kuskokwim River. Red Devil was named after the Red Devil cinnabar mine, a primary source of mercury. It has been found in Dominica near its sulfur springs at the southern end of the island along the west coast. Cinnabar is still being deposited at the present day, such as from the hot waters of Sulphur Bank Mine in California and Steamboat Springs, Nevada.alt=  Mining and extraction of mercury  Apparatus for the distillation of cinnabar, Alchimia, 1570 As the most common source of mercury in nature, cinnabar has been mined for thousands of years, even as far back as the Neolithic Age. During the Roman Empire it was mined both as a pigment, and for its mercury content. To produce liquid mercury (quicksilver), crushed cinnabar ore is roasted in rotary furnaces. Pure mercury separates from sulfur in this process and easily evaporates. A condensing column is used to collect the liquid metal, which is most often shipped in iron flasks.  Toxicity  Associated modern precautions for use and handling of cinnabar arise from the toxicity of the mercury component, which was recognized as early as in ancient Rome. Because of its mercury content, cinnabar can be toxic to human beings. Overexposure to mercury, mercurialism, was seen as an occupational disease to the ancient Romans. Though people in ancient South America often used cinnabar for art, or processed it into refined mercury (as a means to gild silver and gold to objects) the toxic properties of mercury were well known. It was dangerous to those who mined and processed cinnabar; it caused shaking, loss of sense, and death. Data suggests that mercury was retorted from cinnabar and the workers were exposed to the toxic mercury fumes. \\"Mining in the Spanish cinnabar mines of Almad√©n, southwest of Madrid, was regarded as being akin to a death sentence due to the shortened life expectancy of the miners, who were slaves or convicts.\\"  Decorative use  Cinnabar has been used for its color since antiquity in the Near East, including as a rouge-type cosmetic, in the New World since the Olmec culture, and in China for writing on Oracle bones as early as the Zhou dynasty. Later in the Song dynasty it was used in coloring lacquerware. Cinnabar's use as a color in the New World, since the Olmec culture, is exemplified by its use in royal burial chambers during the peak of Maya civilization, most dramatically in the 7th-century Tomb of the Red Queen in Palenque, where the remains of a noble woman and objects belonging to her in her sarcophagus were completely covered with bright red powder made from cinnabar. The most popularly known use of cinnabar is in Chinese carved lacquerware, a technique that apparently originated in the Song dynasty. The danger of mercury poisoning may be reduced in ancient lacquerware by entraining the powdered pigment in lacquer, but could still pose an environmental hazard if the pieces were accidentally destroyed. In the modern jewellery industry, the toxic pigment is replaced by a resin-based polymer that approximates the appearance of pigmented lacquer. Chinese carved cinnabar lacquerware, late Qing dynasty.

Life and career Grave of Louis Gathmann at Glenwood Cemetery. Gathmann was born in Hanover. His father was a school teacher, and instilled in his son a lifelong love of astronomy. He moved to the United States in 1864, and eventually moved to Chicago where he lived until the end of the 19th century, when he moved to Washington, D.C. He started his career designing equipment for mills and farms, and held numerous patents. By the 1880s, Gathmann's patents were in such demand that he had to form a company to help track and produce his designs. This company, known as the Garden City Mill Furnishing Company, made milling machines which were sold all over the globe. By the 1880s, Gathmann had made enough money to have his family moved to the United States from Prussia. He also had four mansions built, two in Chicago, one in Washington D.C., and one in Baltimore, Maryland. Gathmann was very interested in astronomy and had three observatories built in the Chicago area during the 1880s, one of which was a domed observatory tower which he had installed on the side of his mansion on Lincoln Avenue. In the 1890s, Louis had invented a \\"Sectional Telescope Lens.\\" Louis was also involved in 19th century weather modification projects, and in 1891 received a patent for a rain-making in which liquid carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere by explosion (either from an artillery shell or by being carried aloft by a balloon). He also wrote a book on the subject, Rain Produced At Will. From the 1890s on, Louis Gathmann focused on ordnance development. The largest gun designed by Gathmann was the 18-inch Gathmann Gun, which was a coastal defense gun manufactured by Bethlehem Steel under Emil Gathmann (head of Bethlehem Steel's Ordnance Section, and one of Gathmann's sons). The gun was tested at Sandy Hook, but the projectile performed far worse than traditional armor- piercing rounds.; ; Louis was also involved with early aircraft development and had attempted to develop a helicopter, but his successes came in developing fuses for high-explosive ordnance. Newspapers reported in the spring of 1915 that Gathmann invented the German 42-cm Big Bertha howitzer, and that these plans were subsequently stolen from the U.S. Patent Office. But these rumors were false, as no such blueprints were ever filed. During World War I, Louis conceived a multi-hull naval armor design which incorporated buffer zones, shocks and deflectors. Gathman is also the likely engineer of a submarine that was recovered from the Chicago River in December 1915 and was at that time popularly dubbed \\"The Foolkiller\\". Gathmann died on June 3, 1917, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, three sons, and two daughters.

An illusion is a distortion of the senses, which can reveal how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation. Though illusions distort our perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people.Solso, R. L. (2001). Cognitive psychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions (optical illusions) are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words. Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception. These assumptions are made using organizational principles (e.g., Gestalt theory), an individual's capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy. Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within one's physical environment. The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or another auditory source) would be an illusion. Visual Example of visual illusion: a real gecko hunts the pointer of a mouse, confused with a prey An optical illusion. Square A is exactly the same shade of grey as Square B. (See Checker shadow illusion.) A visual illusion or optical illusion The term \\"optical illusion\\" derives, not from optics in today's sense, but from the Greek word for \\"seeing\\". So an \\"optical illusion\\" is an illusion of seeing. is characterized by visually perceived images that are deceptive or misleading. Therefore, the information gathered by the visual sense is processed to give, on the face of it, a percept that does not tally with information from other senses or physical measurement. A conventional assumption is that there are physiological illusions that occur naturally and cognitive illusions that can be demonstrated by specific visual tricks that say something more basic about how human perceptual systems work. The visual system (eye and brain) constructs a world inside our head based on what it samples from the surrounding environment. However, sometimes it tries to organize this information \\"it thinks best\\" while other times it fills in the gaps. Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2008), J. Visual Comm.

Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2014), arXiv:1406.1265, Illusory shapes via phase transition. This way in which our brain works is the basis of an illusion. Auditory An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing, the auditory equivalent of a visual illusion: the listener hears either sound which are not present in the stimulus, or \\"impossible\\" sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors (for better or for worse). One example of an auditory illusion is a Shepard tone. Tactile Examples of tactile illusions include phantom limb, the thermal grill illusion, the cutaneous rabbit illusion and a curious illusion that occurs when the crossed index and middle fingers are run along the bridge of the nose with one finger on each side, resulting in the perception of two separate noses. The brain areas activated during illusory tactile perception are similar to those activated during actual tactile stimulation. Tactile illusions can also be elicited through haptic technology. These \\"illusory\\" tactile objects can be used to create \\"virtual objects\\".The Cutting Edge of Haptics (MIT Technology Review article) Temporal A temporal illusion is a distortion in the perception of time, which occurs when the time interval between two or more events is very narrow (typically less than a second). In such cases, a person may momentarily perceive time as slowing down, stopping, speeding up, or running backward. Other senses Illusions can occur with the other senses including those involved in food perception. Both soundZampini M & Spence C (2004) \\"The role of auditory cues in modulating the perceived crispness and staleness of potato chips\\". Journal of Sensory Studies 19, 347-363. and touchBarnett-Cowan M (2010) \\"An illusion you can sink your teeth into Haptic cues modulate the perceived freshness and crispness of pretzels\\" . Perception 39, 1684-1686. have been shown to modulate the perceived staleness and crispness of food products. It was also discovered that even if some portion of the taste receptor on the tongue became damaged that illusory taste could be produced by tactile stimulation.Todrank, J & Bartoshuk, L.M., 1991 Evidence of olfactory (smell) illusions occurred when positive or negative verbal labels were given prior to olfactory stimulation.Herz R. S. & Von Clef J., 2001 The McGurk effect shows that what we hear is influenced by what we see as we hear the person speaking. An illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. This is a multisensory, auditory-visual illusion. Disorders Some illusions occur as a result of an illness or a disorder. While these types of illusions are not shared with everyone, they are typical of each condition. For example, migraine sufferers often report fortification illusions. Neuroscience Perception is linked to specific brain activity and so can be elicited by brain stimulation. The (illusory) percepts that can be evoked range from simple phosphenes (detections of lights in the visual field) to high-level percepts. In a single-case study on a patient undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, electrical stimulation at the left temporo-parietal junction evoked the percept of a nearby (illusory) person who \\"closely 'shadowed' changes in the patient's body position and posture\\".

Tuttle Publishing, 1996. p. 46. is a Japanese new religion which is neither strictly monotheistic nor pantheistic, originating from the teachings of a 19th-century woman named Nakayama Miki, known to her followers as Oyasama.Fukaya, Tadamasa, \\"The Fundamental Doctrines of Tenrikyo,\\" Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department, Tenri-Jihosha, 1960, p.2 Followers of Tenrikyo believe that God of Origin, God in Truth, known by several names including \\"Tsukihi,\\" \\"Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto\\" and \\"Oyagamisama (God the Parent)\\" revealed divine intent through Miki Nakayama as the Shrine of God\\"I wish to receive Miki as the Shrine of God.\\" The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters, 2006, p.3. and to a lesser extent the roles of the Honseki Izo Iburi and other leaders. Tenrikyo's worldly aim is to teach and promote the Joyous Life, which is cultivated through acts of charity and mindfulness called hinokishin.

Beliefs The ultimate spiritual aim of Tenrikyo is the construction of the Kanrodai, a divinely ordained pillar in an axis mundi called the Jiba, and the correct performance of the Kagura ritual around the Kanrodai, which will bring about the salvation of all human beings. The idea of the Jiba as the origin of earthly creation is called moto-no-ri, or the principle of origin. A pilgrimage to the Jiba is interpreted as a return to one's origin, so the greeting okaeri nasai (welcome home) is seen on many inns in Tenri City. Other key teachings include: * Tanno (Joyous Acceptance) ‚Äì a constructive attitude towards troubles, illness and difficulties * Juzen-no- Shugo ‚Äì ten principles involved in the creation, which exist in Futatsu Hitotsu (two-in-one relationships) and are considered to be applied continuously throughout the universe =Joyous Life= Frame from a Tenrikyo manga. The translation of the text is roughly, \\"Just being alive makes me happy! What a waste it would be not to show some initiative!\\" The Joyous Life in Tenrikyo is defined as charity and abstention from greed, selfishness, hatred, anger and arrogance. Negative tendencies are not known as sins in Tenrikyo, but rather as \\"dust\\" that can be swept away from the mind through hinokishin and ritual. Hinokishin, voluntary effort, is performed not out of a desire to appear selfless, but out of gratitude for kashimono-karimono and shugo (providence). =Ontology= The most basic teaching of Tenrikyo is kashimono-karimono, meaning \\"a thing lent, a thing borrowed\\". The thing that is lent and borrowed is the human body. Tenrikyo followers think of their minds as things that are under their own control, but their bodies are not completely under their control.The Doctrine of Tenrikyo Chapter 7: A Thing Lent, A Thing Borrowed pp. 50-57 =God= The sacred name of the single God and creator of the entire universe in Tenrikyo is \\"Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto\\" (Â§©ÁêÜÁéãÂëΩ). Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto created humankind so that humans may live joyously and to partake in that joy. The body is a thing borrowed, but the mind alone is one's own, thus it is commonly accepted that Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto is not omnipotent. Other gods are considered instruments, such as the Divine Providences, and were also created by Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto. Tenrikyo's doctrine names four properties of Tenri-O-no-Mikoto: as the God who became openly revealed in the world, as the creator who created the world and humankind, as the sustainer and protector who gives existence and life to all creation, and as the savior whose intention in becoming revealed is to save all humankind.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.110. Through her scriptures (the Mikagura-uta and Ofudesaki), Nakayama conveyed the concept of the divine to her followers in steps.Tenrikyo, Its History and Teachings, 47-8.Fukaya, Yoshikazu. Words of the Path: A Guide to Tenrikyo Terms and Expressions 4-5. *Firstly as Kami (Á•û, \\"spirit/god/deity\\"). Kami was a familiar term for her followers since they commonly referred to the spirits of the ethnic religion of Shinto, which were worshipped and venerated in Japan. To differentiate this divinity from the Shinto spirits, Oyasama clarified its characteristics with phrases such as \\"God of Origin\\" (moto no kami) and \\"God in Truth\\" (jitsu no Kami).A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, 105, 108-9.The Doctrine of Tenrikyo opens with the line, \\"I am God of Origin, God in Truth.\\" *Secondly as Tsukihi (ÊúàÊó•, \\"Moon-Sun\\"). The moon and sun could be understood as visual manifestations of the divine. Just as those bodies impartially give the world light and warmth at all times of the day, the workings of the divine are also impartial and constant.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, 454-5. *Finally as Oya („Çí„ÇÑ, \\"Parent\\"). The relationship between the divine and human beings is the mutual feeling of love between a parent and his or her children. The divine does not want to command and punish human beings, but rather to guide and nurture them so that they may live joyfully and cheerfully together. Oya is both paternal and maternal, not simply one or the other.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, 274-5.Tenrikyo Christian Dialogue, 55. These steps have been described as an \\"unfolding in the revelation of God's nature in keeping with the developing capacity of human understanding, from an all-powerful God, to a nourishing God, and finally to an intimate God.\\"Kisala, Robert (2001). \\"Images of God in Japanese New Religions.\\" Bulletin of the Nanzan Institute for Religion & Culture, 25, p. 23. Followers use the phrase \\"God the Parent\\" (Oyagamisama) to refer to God, and the divine name \\"Tenri-O-no-Mikoto\\" when praising or worshipping God through prayer or ritual.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.109. =Causality= Comparison to karmic belief The concept of \\"causality\\" (innen „ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) in Tenrikyo is a unique understanding of karmic belief. Although causality resembles karmic beliefs found in religious traditions originating in ancient India, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, Tenrikyo's doctrine does not claim to inherit the concept from these traditions and differs from their explanations of karma in a few significant ways. Broadly speaking, karma refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).Karma Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2012) In other words, a person's good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.Lawrence C. Becker & Charlotte B. Becker, Encyclopedia of Ethics, 2nd Edition, , Hindu Ethics, pp 678 Causality and karma are interchangeable in this sense;Kisala, Robert. \\"Contemporary Karma: Interpretations of Karma in Tenriky≈ç and Rissh≈ç K≈çseikai.\\" Japanese Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1 (Mar., 1994), pp. 73-91: \\"In accord with traditional karmic understanding, it is the accumulation of bad innen that is offered as the explanation for present suffering.\\" throughout life a person may experience good and bad causality. In Tenrikyo, the concept is encapsulated in the farming metaphor, \\"every seed sown will sprout.\\"Fukaya, Yoshikazu. \\"Every Seed Sown Will Sprout.\\" Words of the Path. online link Karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth,James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, , pp 351-352 such that one's past deeds in the current life and in all previous lives are reflected in the present moment, and one's present deeds are reflected in the future of the current life and in all future lives.\\"Karma\\" in: John Bowker (1997), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press. This understanding of rebirth is upheld in causality as well.Kisala, p.77. \\"...traditional karmic beliefs in personal responsibility, extending over innumerable lifetimes, are upheld in doctrines concerning individual innen.\\" Tenrikyo's ontology, however, differs from older karmic religious traditions such as Buddhism. In Tenrikyo, the human person is believed to consist of mind, body, and soul. The mind, which is given the freedom to sense, feel, and act by God the Parent, ceases to function at death. On the other hand, the soul, through the process of denaoshi (Âá∫Áõ¥„Åó, \\"to make a fresh start\\"), takes on a new body lent from God the Parent and is reborn into this world. Though the reborn person has no memory of the previous life, the person's thoughts and deeds leave their mark on the soul and are carried over into the new life as the person's causality.Kisala, p.77. As can be seen, Tenrikyo's ontology, which rests on the existence on a single creator deity (God the Parent), differs from Buddhist ontology, which does not contain a creator deity. Also Tenrikyo's concept of salvation, which is to live the Joyous Life in this existence and therefore does not promise a liberated afterlife outside of this existence, differs from Buddhist concepts of sa·πÉsƒÅra and nirvana.Tenrikyo-Christian Dialogue, p. 429-430. \\"Original causality\\" At the focal point of Tenrikyo's ontological understanding is the positing of \\"original causality,\\" or \\"causality of origin\\" (moto no innen „ÇÇ„Å®„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì), which is that God the Parent created human beings to see them live the Joyous Life (the salvific state) and to share in that joy. Tenrikyo teaches that the Joyous Life will eventually encompass all humanity, and that gradual progress towards the Joyous Life is even now being made with the guidance of divine providence. Thus the concept of original causality has a teleological element, being the gradual unfolding of that which was ordained at the beginning of time. \\"Individual causality\\" Belief in individual causality is related to the principle of original causality. Individual causality is divine providence acting to realize the original causality of the human race, which through the use of suffering guides individuals to realize their causality and leads them to a change of heart and active cooperation towards the establishment of the Joyous Life, the world that was ordained at the beginning of time.Kisala, p.77-8. Tenrikyo's doctrine explains that an individual's suffering should not be perceived as punishment or retributive justice from divine providence for past misdeeds, but rather as a sign of encouragement from divine providence for the individual to reflect on the past and to undergo a change of heart. The recognition of the divine providence at work should lead to an attitude of tanno („Åü„Çì„ÅÆ„ÅÜ \\"joyous acceptance\\" in Tenrikyo gloss), a Japanese word that indicates a state of satisfaction. Tanno is a way of settling the mind ‚Äì it is not to merely resign oneself to one's situation, but rather to actively ‚Äúrecognize God‚Äôs parental love in all events and be braced by their occurrence into an ever firmer determination to live joyously each day.‚ÄùDoctrine of Tenrikyo, Tenrikyo Church HQ, 61. In other words, Tenrikyo emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive inner disposition, as opposed to a disposition easily swayed by external circumstance.Kisala, p.78. \\"Three causalities\\" In addition, The Doctrine of Tenrikyo names three causalities (san innen „Åï„Çì„ÅÑ„Çì„Å≠„Çì) that are believed to predetermine the founding of Tenrikyo's teachings. More precisely, these causalities are the fulfillment of the promise that God made to the models and instruments of creation, which was that \\"when the years equal to the number of their first born had elapsed, they would be returned to the Residence of Origin, the place of original conception, and would be adored by their posterity.\\"The Doctrine of Tenrikyo, p.20. The \\"Causality of the Soul of Oyasama\\" denotes that Miki Nakayama had the soul of the original mother at creation (Izanami-no-Mikoto), who conceived, gave birth to, and nurtured humankind. The \\"Causality of the Residence\\" means that the Nakayama Residence, where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters stands, is the place that humankind was conceived. The \\"Causality of the Promised Time\\" indicates that October 26, 1838 ‚Äì the day when God became openly revealed through Miki Nakayama ‚Äì marked the time when the years equal to the number of first-born humans (900,099,999) had elapsed since the moment humankind was conceived.A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p.436. Texts =Scriptures= The three scriptures (sangenten ‰∏âÂéüÂÖ∏) of Tenrikyo are the Ofudesaki, Mikagura-uta, and Osashizu. The Ofudesaki („Åä„Åµ„Åß„Åï„Åç, \\"Tip of the Writing Brush\\") is the most important Tenrikyo scripture. A 17-volume collection of 1,711 waka poems, the Ofudesaki was composed by the foundress of Tenrikyo, Miki Nakayama, from 1869 to 1882. The Mikagura-uta („Åø„Åã„Åê„Çâ„ÅÜ„Åü \\"The Songs for the Service\\") is the text of the Service (otsutome), a religious ritual that has a central place in Tenrikyo.The importance of the Service to Tenrikyo followers can be appreciated if one understands that the main theme of the Ofudesaki, the most important of the three Tenrikyo scriptures, has been described as \\"a development toward the perfection of Tsutome, the Service, through which, alone, human salvation can be realized.\\" See Inoue and Eynon, A Study of the Ofudesaki, xix. During the Service, the text to the Mikagura-uta is sung together with dance movements and musical accompaniment, all of which was composed and taught by Miki Nakayama. The Osashizu („Åä„Åï„Åó„Å• \\"Divine Directions\\") is a written record of oral revelations given by Izo Iburi. The full scripture is published in seven volumes (plus an index in three volumes) and contains around 20,000 \\"divine directions\\" delivered between January 4, 1887 and June 9, 1907.Tenrikyo Overseas Department, trans. 2010. A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, p. 72. Note: This work presents an abridged translation of the Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, compiled by the Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion and published in 1997 by Tenrikyo Doyusha Publishing Company. According to Shozen Nakayama, the second Shinbashira (the spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), the Ofudesaki \\"reveal[s] the most important principles of the faith,\\" the Mikagura-uta ‚Äúcome[s] alive through singing or as the accompaniment\\" to the Service, and the Osashizu \\"gives concrete precepts by which the followers should reflect on their own conduct.\\"\\"The Various Forms of Verbal Evolution in Tenrikyo Doctrine\\" that was presented at the 10th Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions held in Marburg in 1960. =Supplemental texts to the scriptures= The supplemental texts to the scriptures (jungenten Ê∫ñÂéüÂÖ∏) are officially sanctioned texts which, along with the scriptures, are used to instruct students and adherents of Tenrikyo. They are required texts for students enrolling in Tenrikyo's seminary programs, such as the three-month \\"Spiritual Development Course\\" (Shuyoka ‰øÆÈ§äÁßë). The Doctrine of Tenrikyo is Tenrikyo's official doctrine, which explains the basic teachings of Tenrikyo. The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo is Tenrikyo's hagiography of Miki Nakayama. The Anecdotes of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo is an anthology of anecdotes about Nakayama that were passed down orally by her first followers and later written down and verified.  Organization  Tenrikyo is subdivided into many different groups with common goals but differing functions. These range from the Daikyokai (lit. large church), to disaster relief corps, medical staff and hospitals, universities, museums, libraries, and various schools. Tenri Judo is renowned as a successful competition style of Judo that has produced many champions, while there are also other sporting and arts interest groups within Tenrikyo. History In Tenrikyo tradition, Nakayama Miki was chosen as the Shrine of God in 1838, after her son and husband began suffering from serious ailments. The family called a Buddhist monk to exorcise the spirit causing the ailments. When the monk temporarily left and asked Miki to take over, she was possessed by the One god (Tenri-O-no-Mikoto), who demanded that Miki be given to God as a shrine. Miki's husband gave in to this request three days later. Nakayama Miki's statements and revelations as Shrine of God were supplemented by Izo Iburi, one of her earliest followers, who developed a position of revelatory leadership as her deputy, answering questions from followers and giving \\"timely talks\\". His position, which is no longer held in Tenrikyo, was called Honseki. The revelatory transmissions of the Honseki were written down and collected in large, multi-volume works called Osashizu. Following Izo's death, a woman called Ueda Naraito partially carried on this role for a while, although it appears that she did not have the actual title of \\"Honseki\\". Since then, Tenrikyo itself has never had a Honseki, although some Tenrikyo splinter groups believe that the revelatory leadership passed from Iburi to their particular founder or foundress. Miki Nakayama's eldest son obtained a license to practice as a low-ranking Shinto priest from the powerful Yoshida branch of Shinto in 1867, but did so against his mother's wishes. Tenrikyo was designated as one of the thirteen groups included in Sect Shinto between 1908 and 1945 under State Shinto.The Formation of Sect Shinto in Modernizing Japan Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 29/3-4, Inoue Nobutaka, pp. 406, 416-17 During this time, Tenrikyo became the first new religion to do social work in Japan, opening an orphanage, a public nursery and a school for the blind.Isaku Kanzaki. \\"Present Day Shintoism\\". In Paul S. Meyer (ed.), The Japan Mission Year Book 1928. Tokyo: Japan Advertiser Press, 1928. Although Tenrikyo is now completely separate from Shinto and Buddhism organizationally, it still shares many of the traditions of Japanese religious practice. For instance, many of the objects used in Tenrikyo religious services, such as hassoku and sanpo, were traditionally used in Japanese ritual, and the method of offering is also traditional. =Timeline= * 1798, April 18 (lunar calendar) ‚Äì Nakayama Miki was born. * 1838, December 12 (October 26, lunar calendar) ‚Äì God was revealed to Miki Nakayama at the Mishima Shrine. * 1854 ‚Äì Nakayama begins to administer the Grant for Safe Childbirth, and thus begins to recruit her first followers. * 1866 ‚Äì First chapters of Ofudesaki appear. * 1887, January 26 (lunar calendar) ‚Äì the death of Miki Nakayama. * 1908 - official recognition as one of the thirteen branches of Sect Shinto. Religious services Instruments used to perform Otsutome (audio) Music being performed during a local daily service. Tenrikyo utilises traditional musical instruments in its otsutome (lit. service or duty), Hyoshigi (wooden clappers), Chanpon (cymbals), Surigane (small gong), Taiko (large drum), Tsuzumi (shoulder drum), Fue (bamboo flute), Shamisen, Koky≈´, and Koto. These are used to play music from the Mikagura-Uta, a body of music, dances and songs created by Nakayama. Most of the world's foremost authorities on Gagaku music (the ancient classical Shinto music of the imperial court of Japan) are also Tenrikyo followers, and Gagaku music is actively promoted by Tenrikyo, although, strictly speaking, the Mikagura-Uta and Gagaku are separate musical forms. The Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and Fue were traditionally the men's instruments but are now acceptable for women to play. The Shamisen, Kokyu, and Koto were traditionally women's instruments and, although not very popular, are now acceptable for men to play as well. =Daily services= The Otsutome or daily service consists of the performance of the seated service and, optionally, the practice of a chapter or two of the 12 chapters of Teodori (lit. hand dance) or Yorozuyo. The daily service is performed twice a day; once in the morning and then in the evening. The service times are adjusted according to the time of sun rise and sun set but may vary from church to church. Service times at the Jiba in Tenri City go by this time schedule and adjust in the changing of seasons. Instruments used in the daily service are the Hyoshigi, Chanpon, Surigane, Taiko, and Kazutori (a counter, to count the 21 times the first section is repeated). The Hyoshigi is always played by the head minister of the church or mission station. If the head minister is not present, anyone may take his or her place. The daily service does not need to be performed at a church. It can be done at any time and anywhere, so long as that one faces the direction of the Jiba, or \\"home of the parent\\". The purpose of the daily service, as taught by Miki Nakayama, is to sweep away the Eight Mental Dusts of the mind. =Hinokishin= Hinokishin (lit. daily service) is a spontaneous action that is an expression of gratitude and joy for being allowed to \\"borrow\\" his or her body from God the Parent. Such an action ideally is done as an act of religious devotion out of a wish to help or bring joy to others, without any thought of compensation. Hinokishin can range from helping someone to just a simple smile to brighten another person's day. Examples of common Hinokishin activities that are encouraged include cleaning public bathrooms and parks among other such acts of community service. Doing the work that others want to do least are considered sincere in the eyes of God. Hinokishin is a method of \\"sweeping\\" the \\"mental dusts\\" that accumulate in our minds. The \\"mental dusts\\" are referring to the Eight Mental Dusts. The official translations of these dusts are: Miserliness (Oshii), Covetousness (Hoshii), Hatred (Nikui), Self- love (Kawai), Grudge-bearing (Urami), Anger (Haradachi), Greed (Yoku), Arrogance (Kouman).Mental Dusts Tenrikyo International Website The Tenrikyo Young Men's Association and Tenrikyo Women's Association are Tenrikyo-based groups that perform group activities as public service. To participate in such groups may be considered Hinokishin. =Monthly services= Tenrikyo service performers wearing traditional montsuki after a monthly service. Tsukinamisai or the monthly service is a performance of the entire Mikagura-Uta, the sacred songs of the service, which is the service for world salvation. Generally, mission headquarters and grand churches (churches with 100 or more others under them) have monthly services performed on the third Sunday of every month; other churches perform on any other Sunday of the month. The monthly service at the Jiba is performed on the 26th of every month, the day of the month in which Tenrikyo was first conceived ‚Äì October 26, 1838. Instruments used in the monthly service are all of those aforementioned. Performers also include dancers ‚Äì three men and three women ‚Äì and a singer. Performers wear traditional montsuki, which may or may not be required depending on the church. =Divine Grant of Sazuke= A Yoboku administering the Sazuke on a follower. The Divine Grant of Sazuke is a healing prayer in which one may attain through attending the nine Besseki lectures. When one receives the Divine Grant of Sazuke, he or she is considered a Yoboku (lit. useful timber). The Sazuke is to be administered to those who are suffering from illness to request God's blessings for a recovery. However, recovery requires the sincere effort from both the recipient and the administrator of the Sazuke to clean their minds of \\"mental dust.\\" Only with pure minds then can the blessings be received by the recipient through the Yoboku administering the Sazuke. It is taught that when God accepts the sincerity of the person administering the Sazuke and the sincerity of the person to whom it is being administered, a wondrous salvation will be bestowed. This is accomplished through having the recipient be aware of the mental dusts and the teachings of Tenrikyo to remedy their dusty minds.

It is located on Highway 23, midway between the cities of Calgary and Lethbridge. The population of the town was 1,917 in 2016. Now known as the \\"Official Star Trek Capital of Canada\\", Vulcan has a tourism building made to look like a landed space station, a statue of the original series Enterprise, and other Star Trek themed attractions.  History  Vulcan elevator row in the 1960s Vulcan was named by a surveyor for the Canadian Pacific Railway after the Roman God of Fire ‚Äì Vulcan. Originally, all the streets of Vulcan were named after gods and goddesses of the classical world such as Juno, Mars, and Jupiter. The community was incorporated as a village on December 23, 1912 and then as a town on June 15, 1921. In July 1927, a major tornado destroyed many homes and the new curling rink in the town. That tornado was made famous when a photograph of it approaching Vulcan was used for the \\"tornado\\" article in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The first newspaper to serve the area was the Vulcan Review, which began in 1912 and was published for one year. The Vulcan Review was followed by the Vulcan Advocate in 1913, which is still being published today as member of Sun Media Community Newspapers part of Postmedia Network. left Vulcan once had nine grain elevators, more than any other location west of Winnipeg, making it the largest grain shipping point at that time. Due to the changing economics of the agricultural industry, the original elevators were taken down one by one. Today, Vulcan has only one of the \\"prairie skyscrapers\\" left that once could be seen miles away. Although not original, this last wooden elevator was built in the 1980s. A British Commonwealth Air Training Plan air force base, RCAF Station Vulcan, was located southwest of the town during the Second World War. Many of the old hangars still exist and the runways can still be seen. It is now operated as Vulcan/Kirkcaldy Aerodrome and some of the old runways are still in use. There is a second airport, Vulcan Airport. In 2015 the town council voted to form Heritage Advisory Board Committee to manage the historical sites in Vulcan County.  Demographics  Centre Street 2008 In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Vulcan recorded a population of 1,917 living in 829 of its 879 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 1,836. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Vulcan had a population of 1,836 living in 768 of its 865 total dwellings, a ‚àí5.4% change from its 2006 population of 1,940. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. Starship Enterprise and named after Vulcan Airport's designation CFX6  Economy  The town's economy is mainly tourism and agriculture-based. Wheat, canola and barley are the main crops grown in the Vulcan area. = Tourism = Since 1990, Vulcan has hosted the annual Vulcan Tinman Triathlon, which takes place at the beginning of June. This sprint-distance triathlon attracts nearly 1,000 participants. There are classes for adults of all ages and skill levels as well as for teams and children. The town's name has brought some attention that has helped it become a tourist attraction. In the Star Trek television and feature film series it is the name of the homeworld of Mr. Spock and his fellow Vulcans. Capitalizing on this coincidence, the town has built a Star Trek‚Äìthemed tourist station (the Tourism and Trek Station), which provides tourist information, displays Star Trek memorabilia, provides unique photo opportunities, and allows visitors to participate in The Vulcan Space Adventure virtual reality game. Nearby, a replica of the starship Enterprise from Star Trek V has been mounted on a pedestal which includes writing from Star Trek alien languages such as Klingon. The town has also created space-themed murals and signs, and hosts an annual community-wide Star Trek convention known as \\"Spock Days\\". This convention attracts hundreds of Star Trek fans from around the world.  Infrastructure  = Healthcare = Vulcan Community Healthcare Centre The Vulcan Community Healthcare Centre offers emergency and long- term care medical services. The hospital had 5,125 visits for emergency medical services in the 2013/2014 year. It has eight medical beds with 15 long-term care beds and hosts a medical clinic.http://www.vulcanbusiness.ca/residents/health/  Geography  = Climate = Vulcan experiences a dry continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.

Common devices used include dice, spinning tops, playing cards, roulette wheels, or numbered balls drawn from a container. Alternatively, a game of skill is one where the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill, rather than chance. While a game of chance may have some skill element to it, chance generally plays a greater role in determining its outcome. A game of skill may also may have elements of chance, but skill plays a greater role in determining its outcome. Any game of chance that involves anything of monetary value is gambling. Gambling is known in nearly all human societies, even though many have passed laws restricting it. Early people used the knucklebones of sheep as dice. Some people develop a psychological addiction to gambling, and will risk even food and shelter to continue. Some games of chance may also involve a certain degree of skill. This is especially true where the player or players have decisions to make based upon previous or incomplete knowledge, such as blackjack. In other games like roulette and punto banco (baccarat) the player may only choose the amount of bet and the thing he wants to bet on; the rest is up to chance, therefore these games are still considered games of chance with small amount of skills required. The distinction between 'chance' and 'skill' is relevant because in some countries chance games are illegal or at least regulated, but skill games are not. Since there is no standardized definition, poker, for example, has been ruled a game of chance in Germany and, by at least one New York state Federal judge, a game of skill there.  Addiction  People who engage in games of chance and gambling can develop a strong dependence on them. This is called psychopathology (addiction) of \\"pathological gambling\\". According to psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler, there are six characteristics of pathological gamblers: # They must play regularly: the issue here is to know from when the subject performs \\"too much.\\" # The game takes precedence over all other interests. # There is optimism in the player that is not initiated by repeated experiences of failure. # The player never stops until they win. # Despite the precautions that they originally promised, they end up taking too many risks. # There is in them a subjective experience of \\"thrill\\" (a shivering sensation, excitement, tension, both painful and pleasant) during the phases of play.

R. R. Tolkien created a number of constructed languages, including languages devised for fictional settings. Inventing languages, something that he called glossopoeia (paralleling his idea of mythopoeia or myth-making), was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice Tolkien's Languages The Tongues of Middle-Earth An early project was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early Germanic language which might have been spoken by the people of Beowulf in the Germanic Heroic Age.Tolkien's name for himself in Gautistk was Undarhruim√©nitupp. J. Garth, Tolkien and the Great War. p. 17. Andrew Higgins, In Dembith Pengoldh A column on Tolkien‚Äôs invented languages (2015) The most developed of his glossopoeic projects was his family of Elvish languages. He first started constructing an Elvin tongue in while he was at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He later called it Quenya (), and he continued actively developing the history and grammar of his Elvish languages until his death in 1973. In 1931, he held a lecture about his passion for constructed languages, titled A Secret Vice. Here he contrasts his project of artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure with the pragmatism of international auxiliary languages. The lecture also discusses Tolkien's views on phonaesthetics, citing Greek, Finnish, and Welsh as examples of \\"languages which have a very characteristic and in their different ways beautiful word- form\\". Tolkien's glossopoeia has two temporal dimensions: the internal (fictional) timeline of events described in The Silmarillion and other writings, and the external timeline of Tolkien's own life during which he often revised and refined his languages and their fictional history. Inspiration and background Tolkien was a professional philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English. He was also interested in many languages outside his field, and developed a particular love for the Finnish language. He described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as \\"like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before\\".The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, letter number 163 (to W. H. Auden, 7 June 1953). Glossopoeia was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. At a little over 13, he helped construct a sound substitution cypher known as Nevbosh, 'new nonsense', which grew to include some elements of actual invented language. Notably, Tolkien claimed that this was not his first effort in invented languages. Shortly thereafter, he developed a true invented language called Naffarin which contained elements that would survive into his later languages, which he continued to work on until his death more than 65 years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works. Language and mythology Tolkien was of the opinion that the invention of an artistic language in order to be convincing and pleasing must include not only the language's historical development, but also the history of its speakers, and especially the mythology associated with both the language and the speakers. It was this idea that an \\"Elvish language\\" must be associated with a complex history and mythology of the Elves that was at the core of the development of Tolkien's legendarium. Tolkien wrote in one of his letters: \\"what I think is a primary 'fact' about my work, that it is all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. ... It is not a 'hobby', in the sense of something quite different from one's work, taken up as a relief- outlet. The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows. I should have preferred to write in ‚ÄòElvish‚Äô. But, of course, such a work as The Lord of the Rings has been edited and only as much 'language' has been left in as I thought would be stomached by readers. (I now find that many would have liked more.) ... It is to me, anyway, largely an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic', as I sometimes say to people who ask me 'what is it all about'.\\"The Letters of J.R.R.Tolkien, pp. 219‚Äì220 While the Elvish languages remained at the center of Tolkien's attention, the requirements of the narratives associated with Middle-earth also necessitated the development at least superficially of the languages of other races, especially of Dwarves and Men, but also the Black Speech designed by Sauron, the main antagonist in The Lord of the Rings. This latter language was designed to be the ostensible antithesis of the ideal of an artistic language pursued with the development of Quenya, the Black Speech representing a dystopian parody of an international auxiliary language just as Sauron's rule over the Orcs is a dystopian parody of a totalitarian state.  Elvish languages  The Elvish language family is a group of languages related by descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language. Tolkien constructed the family from around 1910, working on it up to his death in 1973. He constructed the grammar and vocabulary of at least fifteen languages and dialects in roughly three periods: * 1910 ‚Äì : most of Primitive Quendian the proto-language, Common Eldarin, Quenya and Goldogrin. * : Goldogrin had significantly changed and was now Noldorin, joined by Telerin, Ilkorin, Doriathrin and the Avarin. * The late and mature stage dispensed with Ilkorin and Doriathrin. Noldorin matured into Sindarin. Although the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya are the most famous and the most developed of the languages that Tolkien invented for his Secondary World, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish languages, that originate in Common Eldarin, the language common to all Eldar, which in turn originates in Primitive Quendian, the common root of Eldarin and Avarin languages. Finnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part gave rise to Quenya. Another of Tolkien's favourites was Welsh, and features of Welsh phonology found their way into Sindarin. Very few words were borrowed from existing languages so that attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious. Lhammas and Valarin Tolkien had worked out much of the etymological background of his Elvish languages during the 1930s (collected in the form of The Etymologies). In 1937, he wrote the Lhammas, a linguistic treatise addressing the relationship of not just the Elvish languages, but of all languages spoken in Middle-earth during the First Age. The text purports to be a translation of an Elvish work, written by one Pengolodh, whose historical works are presented as being the main source of the narratives in The Silmarillion concerning the First Age. The Lhammas exists in two versions, the shorter one being called the Lammasathen.Both are published, as edited by Christopher Tolkien, in The Lost Road. The main linguistic thesis in this text is that the languages of Middle-earth are all descended from the language of the Valar (the \\"gods\\"), Valarin, and divided into three branches: *Orom√´an, named after Orom√´, who taught the first Elves to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of Men are Orom√´an. *Aul√´an, named after Aul√´, maker of the Dwarves, is the origin of the Khuzdul language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men. *Melkian, named after the rebellious Melkor or Morgoth, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the Orcs and other evil beings. (This tongue is unrelated to the Black Speech of Sauron.) Tolkien later revised this internal history to the effect that the Elves had been capable of inventing language on their own, before coming into contact with Valarin (see Primitive Quendian). The Lord of the Rings When working on The Lord of the Rings during the 1940s, Tolkien invested great effort into detailing the linguistics of Middle-earth. =Mannish languages= According to Tom Shippey, Tolkien invented parts of Middle-earth to resolve the linguistic puzzle he had accidentally created by using different European languages for those of peoples in his legendarium. When writing The Lord of the Rings, a sequel to The Hobbit, Tolkien came up with a literary device of using real languages to \\"translate\\" fictional languages. He pretended to have translated the original S√¥val Ph√¢r√´ speech (Westron or the Common Speech) into English. This device of rendering an imaginary language with a real one was carried further: * rendering Rohirric, the language of Rohan (related to S√¥val Ph√¢re) by Old English * rendering names in the tongue of Dale by Old Norse forms * and rendering names of the Kingdom of Rhovanion by Gothic forms, thus mapping the genetic relation of his fictional languages on the existing historical relations of the Germanic languages. Rohirric is always represented by the Mercian dialect of Old English because Tolkien chose to make the relationship between Rohirric and the Common Speech similar to that of Old English and Modern English. The terms Rohirric, Rohirian, and Rohanese have all been used to refer to the language. Tolkien himself used \\"Rohanese\\".J.R.R. Tolkien, \\"The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor\\" (edited by Carl F. Hostetter), in Vinyar Tengwar, Number 42, July 2001, p. 8 He only gave a few actual Rohirric words. K√ªd-d√ªkan, an old word meaning \\"hole-dweller\\", which evolved to kuduk, the name the Hobbits had for themselves. \\"L√¥‚Äì\\"/\\"loh‚Äì\\" corresponding to Anglo-Saxon \\"√©o\\", horse, and the derived names L√¥grad for Horse-Mark, and Loht√ªr for √âoth√©od, horse-people. This word is an exact homonym of the Hungarian word for horse, l√≥. The Rohirric word for horse has been identified as a cognate for Tolkien's Elvish words for 'horse': rocco (Quenya) and roch (Sindarin). All names beginning with √âo‚Äì supposedly represent Rohirric names beginning with L√¥‚Äì or Loh‚Äì, but the Rohirric forms of names such as √âomer and √âowyn are not given. Only one proper name is given, that of Th√©oden: the actual form was T√ªrac, an old word for King. Th√©oden is the Old English word √æ√©oden, meaning \\"leader of a people\\" (i.e. \\"King\\" or \\"prince\\").Bosworth, √æe√≥den; (also spelt √∞eoden), cognate to the Old Norse word √æj√≥√∞ann.Solopova, p. 21. \\"Th√©oden ('Lord' in Old English)\\". As with other descriptive names in his legendarium, Tolkien uses this name to create the impression that the text is \\"'historical', 'real' or 'archaic'\\".Solopova, p. 22. Furthermore, to parallel the Celtic substratum in England, he used Old Welsh names to render the Dunlendish names of Buckland Hobbits (e.g., Meriadoc for Kalimac). Because of the device of having Modern English representing Westron, there was no necessity to actually work out the details of Westron grammar or vocabulary in any detail, but Tolkien does give some examples of Westron words in Appendix F to The Lord of the Rings, where he also summarizes its origin and role as lingua franca in Middle-earth: :\\"The language represented in this history by English was the Westron or 'Common Speech' of the West-lands of Middle-earth in the Third Age. In the course of that age it had become the native language of nearly all the speaking-peoples (save the Elves) who dwelt within the bounds of the old kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor ... At the time of the War of the Ring at the end of the age these were still its bounds as a native tongue.\\" (Appendix F) Even orcs had to rely on using Common Speech (albeit in a much-debased form) for communication between themselves, because different orc sub-dialects change so haphazardly that they are not mutually intelligible from one clan to the next. Other \\"Mannish\\" languages envisaged for the setting of The Lord of the Rings, but barely developed in terms of grammar or vocabulary, include Haladin, Dunlendish, Dr√ªg, Haradrim, and Easterling. =Dwarvish= Some samples of the language of the Dwarves, called Khuzdul, are also found in The Lord of the Rings. The situation here is a little different from the \\"Mannish\\" languages: As Khuzdul was kept secret by the Dwarves and never used in the presence of outsiders (not even Dwarvish given names), it was not \\"translated\\" by any real-life historical language, and such limited examples as there are in the text are given in the \\"original\\". Khuzdul was designed to have a \\"Semitic\\" affinity, with a system of triconsonantal roots and other parallels especially to Hebrew, just as some aspects of the Dwarves and the Jews are intentional.Tolkien noted some similarities between Dwarves and Jews: both were \\"at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue\\". Tolkien also commented of the Dwarves that \\"their words are Semitic obviously, constructed to be Semitic.\\" =Entish= The language of the Ents is also described in the novel. As the Ents were first taught to speak by Elves, Entish appears related to the Elvish languages. However, the Ents continued to develop their language. It is described as long and sonorous, a tonal language somewhat like a woodwind instrument. Only the Ents spoke Entish as no others could master it. Even the Elves, master linguists, could not learn Entish, nor did they attempt to record it because of its complex sound structure: :\\"...slow, sonorous, agglomerated, repetitive, indeed long-winded; formed of a multiplicity of vowel-shades and distinctions of tone and quantity which even the loremasters of the Eldar had not attempted to represent in writing\\"The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F To illustrate these properties, Tolkien proves a-lalla-lalla-rumba- kamanda-lindor-bur√∫me, the word for hill, as a purportedly inaccurate sampling of the language. The grammatical structure of Old Entish was also quite bizarre, often described as a lengthy, long-winded discussion of a topic. There may not even have been words for yes and no: such questions would be answered by a long monologue on why the Ent in question did or did not agree with the Ent who asked the question. The Ent Quickbeam was regarded as a very \\"hasty\\" Ent for answering a question before another Ent had finished: the end may only have been another hour away. Ents as a rule would say nothing in Entish unless it was worth taking a long time to say. Ad√ªnaic Tolkien devised Ad√ªnaic (or N√∫men√≥rean), the language spoken in N√∫menor, shortly after World War II, and thus at about the time he completed The Lord of the Rings, but before he wrote the linguistic background information of the Appendices. Ad√ªnaic is intended as the language from which Westron (also called Ad√ªni) is derived. This added a depth of historical development to the Mannish languages. Ad√ªnaic was intended to have a \\"faintly Semitic flavour\\".Sauron Defeated, p. 240 Its development began with The Notion Club Papers (written in 1945). It is there that the most extensive sample of the language is found, revealed to one of the (modern-day) protagonists, Lowdham, of that story in a visionary dream of Atlantis. Its grammar is sketched in the unfinished \\"Lowdham's Report on the Adunaic Language\\". Tolkien remained undecided whether the language of the Men of N√∫menor should be derived from the original Mannish language (as in Ad√ªnaic), or if it should be derived from \\"the Elvish Noldorin\\" (i.e. Quenya) instead.The Peoples of Middle-earth, p. 63. In The Lost Road and Other Writings it is implied that the N√∫men√≥reans spoke Quenya, and that Sauron, hating all things Elvish, taught the N√∫men√≥reans the old Mannish tongue they themselves had forgotten.The Lost Road and Other Writings (1996), p. 68 and note p. 75.  Artificial scripts  Being a skilled calligrapher, Tolkien not only invented many languages but also scripts. Some of his scripts were designed for use with his constructed languages, others for more practical ends: to be used in his personal diary, and one especially for English, the New English Alphabet.W. Hammond, C. Scull, J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator, p. 190. The following is a list of scripts in chronological order: * Tengwar of R√∫mil or Sarati * Gondolinic Runes * Valmaric script * Andyoqenya * Qenyatic * The New English Alphabet * The \\"Goblin alphabet\\" (in The Father Christmas Letters) * Tengwar of F√´anor * The Cirth of Daeron Reception and study The first published monograph dedicated to the Elvish languages was An Introduction to Elvish (1978) edited by Jim Allan (published by Bran's Head Books). It is composed of articles written before the publication of The Silmarillion. Ruth Noel wrote a book on Middle-earth's languages in 1980. With the publication of much linguistic material during the 1990s, especially in the History of Middle-earth series, and the Vinyar Tengwar and Parma Eldalamberon material published at an increasing rate during the early 2000s from the stock of linguistic material in the possession of the appointed team of editors (some 3000 pages according to them), the subject of Tolkien's constructed languages has become much more accessible. David Salo wrote A Gateway to Sindarin: A Grammar of an Elvish Language from J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (University of Utah Press, 2007). Elizabeth Solopova, Languages, Myth and History: An Introduction to the Linguistic and Literary Background of J. R. R. Tolkien's Fiction (New York City: North Landing Books, 2009) gives an overview of the linguistic traits of the various languages invented by Tolkien and the history of their creation. A few fanzines were dedicated to the subject, like Tyali√´ Tyelelli√©va published by Lisa Star, and Quettar, the Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of The Tolkien Society, published by Julian C. Bradfield. Tengwesti√´ is an online publication of the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship. Internet mailing lists and forums dedicated to Tolkien's constructed languages include Tolklang, Elfling and Lambengolmor. Since 2005, there has been an International Conference on J.R.R. Tolkien's Invented Languages, part of a series of biennial conferences at changing locations. They are open to everyone with a serious interest in Tolkien's invented languages. Attendees are encouraged to prepare, bring, and deliver a paper on any aspect of Tolkien's languages. At a past conference, held in Valencia in 2011, Helge K. Fauskanger presented a piece on Tolkien's use of mor as a syllable to denote evil. A recent line of study includes hidden religious allegories in Tolkien's languages. For instance, lembas bread translates to way bread in Sindarin and life bread in Quenya; the Christian communion bread is referred to as viaticum in Latin (meaning \\"way bread\\") and bread of life in English.

It lives year- round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. It is one of two living species of whale in the family Monodontidae, along with the beluga whale. The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine. The narwhal was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758. Like the beluga, narwhals are medium-sized whales. For both sexes, excluding the male's tusk, the total body size can range from ; the males are slightly larger than the females. The average weight of an adult narwhal is . At around 11 to 13 years old, the males become sexually mature; females become sexually mature at about 5 to 8 years old. Narwhals do not have a dorsal fin, and their neck vertebrae are jointed like those of most other mammals, not fused as in dolphins and most whales. Found primarily in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters, the narwhal is a uniquely specialized Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals eat mostly Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes. In the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. Narwhals, like most toothed whales, communicate with \\"clicks\\", \\"whistles\\", and \\"knocks\\". Narwhals can live up to 50 years. They are often killed by suffocation after being trapped due to the formation of sea ice. Other causes of death, specifically among young whales, are starvation and predation by orcas. As previous estimates of the world narwhal population were below 50,000, narwhals are categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as \\"nearly threatened\\". More recent estimates list higher populations (upwards of 170,000), thus lowering the status to \\"least concern\\". Narwhals have been harvested for hundreds of years by Inuit people in northern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory, and a regulated subsistence hunt continues. Taxonomy and etymology Illustration of a narwhal and a beluga, its closest related species The narwhal was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Its name is derived from the Old Norse word n√°r, meaning \\"corpse\\", in reference to the animal's greyish, mottled pigmentation, like that of a drowned sailor and its summer-time habit of lying still at or near the surface of the sea (called \\"logging\\"). The scientific name, Monodon monoceros, is derived from the Greek: \\"one-tooth one-horn\\". The narwhal is most closely related to the beluga whale. Together, these two species comprise the only extant members of the family Monodontidae, sometimes referred to as the \\"white whales\\". The Monodontidae are distinguished by their medium size (at around in length), pronounced melons (round sensory organs), short snouts, and the absence of a true dorsal fin. Although the narwhal and the beluga are classified as separate genera, with one species each, there is some evidence that they may, very rarely, interbreed. The complete skull of an anomalous whale was discovered in West Greenland circa 1990. It was described by marine zoologists as unlike any known species, but with features midway between a narwhal and a beluga, consistent with the hypothesis that the anomalous whale was a narwhal-beluga hybrid; in 2019, this was confirmed by DNA and isotopic analysis.Hybridization between two high Arctic cetaceans confirmed by genomic analysis, in Nature; Mikkel Skovrind, Jose Alfredo Samaniego Castruita, James Haile, Eve C. Treadaway, Shyam Gopalakrishnan, Michael V. Westbury, Mads Peter Heide-J√∏rgensen, Paul Szpak & Eline D. Lorenzen; Scientific Reports; volume 9, Article number: 7729 (2019) The white whales, dolphins (Delphinidae) and porpoises (Phocoenidae) together comprise the superfamily Delphinoidea, which are of likely monophyletic origin. Genetic evidence suggests the porpoises are more closely related to the white whales, and that these two families constitute a separate clade which diverged from the rest of Delphinoidea within the past 11 million years. Fossil evidence shows that ancient white whales lived in tropical waters. They may have migrated to Arctic and sub- Arctic waters in response to changes in the marine food chain during the Pliocene. Description Complete skeleton at the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences Narwhals are medium- sized whales, and are around the same size as beluga whales. Total length in both sexes, excluding the tusk of the male, can range from . Males, at an average length of , are slightly larger than females, with an average length of . Typical adult body weight ranges from . Male narwhals attain sexual maturity at 11 to 13 years of age, when they are about long. Females become sexually mature at a younger age, between 5 and 8 years old, when they are around long. The pigmentation of narwhals is a mottled pattern, with blackish- brown markings over a white background. They are darkest when born and become whiter with age; white patches develop on the navel and genital slit at sexual maturity. Old males may be almost pure white. Narwhals do not have a dorsal fin, possibly an evolutionary adaptation to swimming easily under ice, to facilitate rolling, or to reduce surface area and heat loss. Instead narwhals possess a shallower dorsal ridge. Their neck vertebrae are jointed, like those of land mammals, instead of being fused together as in most whales, allowing a great range of neck flexibility. Both these characteristics are shared by the beluga whale. The tail flukes of female narwhals have front edges that are swept back, and those of males have front edges that are more concave and lack a sweep-back. This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk. =Tusk= This narwhal skull has rare double tusks. Usually, the canine tooth only on the left side of the upper jaw becomes a tusk. Rarely, males develop two tusks. This specimen, however, was of a female (Zoologisches Museum, Hamburg; collected in 1684). The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhal is a single long tusk, which is in fact a canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw, through the lip, and forms a left-handed helix spiral. The tusk grows throughout life, reaching a length of about . It is hollow and weighs around . About one in 500 males has two tusks, occurring when the right canine also grows out through the lip. Only about 15 percent of females grow a tusk which typically is smaller than a male tusk, with a less noticeable spiral. Collected in 1684, there is only one known case of a female growing a second tusk (image). Scientists have long speculated on the biological function of the tusk. Proposed functions include use of the tusk as a weapon, for opening breathing holes in sea ice, in feeding, as an acoustic organ, and as a secondary sex character. The leading theory has long been that the narwhal tusk serves as a secondary sex character of males, for nonviolent assessment of hierarchical status on the basis of relative tusk size. However, detailed analysis reveals that the tusk is a highly innervated sensory organ with millions of nerve endings connecting seawater stimuli in the external ocean environment with the brain. The rubbing of tusks together by male narwhals is thought to be a method of communicating information about characteristics of the water each has traveled through, rather than the previously assumed posturing display of aggressive male-to-male rivalry. In August 2016, drone videos of narwhals surface-feeding in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut showed that the tusk was used to tap and stun small Arctic cod, making them easier to catch for feeding. It's important to note, however, that the tusk can not serve a critical function for narwhals' survival because females, who generally do not have tusks, still manage to live longer than males and occur in the same areas. Therefore, the general scientific consensus is that the narwhal tusk is a sexual trait, much like the antlers of a stag, the mane of a lion, or the feathers of a peacock. =Vestigial teeth= The tusks are surrounded posteriorly, ventrally, and laterally by several small vestigial teeth which vary in morphology and histology. These teeth can sometimes be extruded from the bone, but mainly reside inside open tooth sockets in the narwhal's snout alongside the tusks. The varied morphology and anatomy of small teeth indicate a path of evolutionary obsolescence, leaving the narwhal's mouth toothless. Distribution Narwhals in the Creswell Bay at Somerset Island The narwhal is found predominantly in the Atlantic and Russian areas of the Arctic Ocean. Individuals are commonly recorded in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, such as in the northern part of Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Baffin Bay; off the east coast of Greenland; and in a strip running east from the northern end of Greenland round to eastern Russia (170¬∞ East). Land in this strip includes Svalbard, Franz Joseph Land, and Severnaya Zemlya. The northernmost sightings of narwhal have occurred north of Franz Joseph Land, at about 85¬∞ North latitude. Most of the world's narwhals are concentrated in the fjords and inlets of Northern Canada and western Greenland. Behaviour =Social= Narwhals normally congregate in groups of about five to ten, and sometimes up to 20 individuals outside the summer. Groups may be \\"nurseries\\" with only females and young, or can contain only post-dispersal juveniles or adult males (\\"bulls\\"), but mixed groups can occur at any time of year. In the summer, several groups come together, forming larger aggregations which can contain from 500 to over 1000 individuals. At times, a bull narwhal may rub its tusk with another bull, a display known as \\"tusking\\" and thought to maintain social dominance hierarchies. However, this behaviour may exhibit tusk use as a sensory and communication organ for sharing information about water chemistry sensed in tusk microchannels. =Migration= Narwhals exhibit seasonal migrations, with a high fidelity of return to preferred, ice-free summering grounds, usually in shallow waters. In summer months, they move closer to coasts, often in pods of 10‚Äì100. In the winter, they move to offshore, deeper waters under thick pack ice, surfacing in narrow fissures in the sea ice, or leads. As spring comes, these leads open up into channels and the narwhals return to the coastal bays. Narwhals from Canada and West Greenland winter regularly in the pack ice of Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along the continental slope with less than 5% open water and high densities of Greenland halibut. Feeding in the winter accounts for a much larger portion of narwhal energy intake than in the summer. =Diet= Narwhals have a relatively restricted and specialized diet. Their prey is predominantly composed of Greenland halibut, polar and Arctic cod, cuttlefish, shrimp and armhook squid. Additional items found in stomachs have included wolffish, capelin, skate eggs and sometimes rocks, accidentally ingested when whales feed near the bottom. Due to the lack of well-developed dentition in the mouth, narwhals are believed to feed by swimming towards prey until it is within close range and then sucking it with considerable force into the mouth. It is thought that the beaked whales, which have similarly reduced dentition, also suck up their prey. The distinctive tusk is used to tap and stun small prey, facilitating a catch. Narwhals have a very intense summer feeding society. One study published in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate. The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979. The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet. A year later, the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed. Arctic cod represented 57%, and Greenland halibut 29% in 1979. The deep-water fish ‚Äì halibut, redfish (Sebastes marinus), and polar cod (Arctogadus glacialis) ‚Äì are found in the diet of the males, which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than below sea level. The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages. =Diving= When in their wintering waters, narwhals make some of the deepest dives recorded for a marine mammal, diving to at least over 15 times per day, with many dives reaching . Dives to these depths last around 25 minutes, including the time spent at the bottom and the transit down and back from the surface. Dive times can also vary in time and depth, based on local variation between environments, as well as seasonality. For example, in the Baffin Bay wintering grounds, narwhals farther south appear to be spending most of their time diving to deeper depths along the steep slopes of Baffin Bay, suggesting differences in habitat structure, prey availability, or innate adaptations between sub-populations. Curiously, whales in the deeper northern wintering ground have access to deeper depths, yet make shallower dives. Because vertical distribution of narwhal prey in the water column influences feeding behavior and dive tactics, regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of prey density, as well as differences in prey assemblage, may be shaping winter foraging behavior of narwhals. =Communication= As most toothed whales, narwhals use sound to navigate and hunt for food. Narwhals primarily vocalize through \\"clicks\\", \\"whistles\\" and \\"knocks\\", created by air movement between chambers near the blow-hole. These sounds are reflected off the sloping front of the skull and focused by the animal's melon, which can be controlled by musculature. Echolocation clicks are primarily produced for prey detection, and for locating obstacles at short distances. It is possible that individual \\"bangs\\" are capable of disorienting or incapacitating prey, making them easier to hunt, but this has not been verified. They also emit tonal signals, such as whistles and pulsed calls, that are believed to have a communication function. The calls recorded from the same herd are more similar than calls from different herds, suggesting the possibility of group or individual-specific calls in narwhals. Narwhals may also adjust the duration and the pitch of their pulsed calls to maximize sound propagation in varying acoustic environments Other sounds produced by narwhals include trumpeting and squeaking door sounds. The narwhal vocal repertoire is similar to that of the closely related beluga, with comparable whistle frequency ranges, whistle duration, and repetition rates of pulse calls, however beluga whistles may have a higher frequency range and more diversified whistle contours. =Breeding and early life= Females start bearing calves when six to eight years old. Adult narwhals mate in April or May when they are in the offshore pack ice. Gestation lasts for 14 months and calves are born between June and August the following year. As with most marine mammals, only a single young is born, averaging in length and white or light grey in colour. During summer population counts along different coastal inlets of Baffin Island, calf numbers varied from 0.05% to 5% of the total numbering from 10,000 to 35,000 narwhals, indicating that higher calf counts may reflect calving and nursery habitats in favorable inlets. Hybrids have been documented between the narwhal and beluga (specifically a beluga male and a narwhal female), as one, perhaps even as many as three, were killed and harvested during a sustenance hunt. Whether or not these hybrids could breed remains unknown. The unusual dentition seen in the single remaining skull indicates the hybrid hunted on the seabed, much as walruses do, indicating feeding habits different from those of either parent species. Newborn calves begin their lives with a thin layer of blubber which thickens as they nurse their mother's milk which is rich in fat. Calves are dependent on milk for around 20 months. This long lactation period gives calves time to learn skills needed for survival during maturation when they stay within two body lengths of the mother. =Life span and mortality= A polar bear scavenging a narwhal carcass Narwhals can live an average of 50 years, however research using aspartic acid racemization from the lens of the eyes suggests that narwhals can live to be as old as 115 ¬± 10 years and 84 ¬± 9 years for females and males, respectively Mortality often occurs when the narwhals suffocate after they fail to leave before the surface of the Arctic waters freeze over in the late autumn. As narwhals need to breathe, they drown if open water is no longer accessible and the ice is too thick for them to break through. Maximum aerobic swimming distance between breathing holes in ice is less than which limits the use of foraging grounds, and these holes must be at least wide to allow an adult whale to breathe. The last major entrapment events occurred when there was little to no wind. Entrapment can affect as many as 600 individuals, most occurring in narwhal wintering areas such as Disko Bay. In the largest entrapment in 1915 in West Greenland, over 1,000 narwhals were trapped under the ice. Despite the decreases in sea ice cover, there were several large cases of sea ice entrapment in 2008‚Äì2010 in the winter close to known summering grounds, two of which were locations where there had been no previous cases documented. This suggests later departure dates from summering grounds. Sites surrounding Greenland experience advection (moving) of sea ice from surrounding regions by wind and currents, increasing the variability of sea ice concentration. Due to strong site fidelity, changes in weather and ice conditions are not always associated with narwhal movement toward open water. More information is needed to determine the vulnerability of narwhals to sea ice changes. Narwhals can also die of starvation. =Predation and hunting= Major predators are polar bears, which attack at breathing holes mainly for young narwhals, Greenland sharks, and walruses. Killer whales (orcas) group together to overwhelm narwhal pods in the shallow water of enclosed bays, in one case killing dozens of narwhals in a single attack. To escape predators such as orcas, narwhals may use prolonged submergence to hide under ice floes rather than relying on speed. Beluga and narwhal catches Humans hunt narwhals, often selling commercially the skin, carved veterbrae, teeth and tusk, while eating the meat, or feeding it to dogs. About 1,000 narwhals per year are killed, 600 in Canada and 400 in Greenland. Canadian harvests were steady at this level in the 1970s, dropped to 300‚Äì400 per year in the late 1980s and 1990s, and rose again since 1999. Greenland harvested more, 700‚Äì900 per year, in the 1980s and 1990s. Tusks are sold with or without carving in Canada and Greenland. An average of one or two vertebrae and one or two teeth per narwhal are carved and sold. In Greenland the skin (muktuk) is sold commercially to fish factories, and in Canada to other communities. One estimate of the annual gross value received from narwhal hunts in Hudson Bay in 2013 was for 81 narwhals, or per narwhal. However the net income, after subtracting costs in time and equipment, was a loss of per person. Hunts receive subsidies, but they continue as a tradition, rather than for the money, and the economic analysis noted that whale watching may be an alternate revenue source. Of the gross income, was for skin and meat, to replace beef, pork and chickens which would otherwise be bought, was received for tusks, and carved vertebrae and teeth of males, and was received for carved vertebrae and teeth of females. Conservation issues Narwhals are one of many mammals that are being threatened by human actions. Estimates of the world population of narwhals range from around 50,000 (from 1996) to around 170,000 (compilation of various sub-population estimates from the years 2000‚Äì2017). They are considered to be near threatened and several sub-populations have evidence of decline. In an effort to support conservation, the European Union established an import ban on tusks in 2004 and lifted it in 2010. The United States has forbidden imports since 1972 under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Narwhals are difficult to keep in captivity. Male narwhal captured and satellite tagged Inuit people hunt this whale species legally, as discussed above in Predation and hunting. Narwhals have been extensively hunted the same way as other sea mammals, such as seals and whales, for their large quantities of fat. Almost all parts of the narwhal, meat, skin, blubber, and organs are consumed. Muktuk, the name for raw skin and blubber, is considered a delicacy. One or two vertebrae per animal are used for tools and art. The skin is an important source of vitamin C which is otherwise difficult to obtain. In some places in Greenland, such as Qaanaaq, traditional hunting methods are used, and whales are harpooned from handmade kayaks. In other parts of Greenland and Northern Canada, high-speed boats and hunting rifles are used. During growth, the narwhal accumulates metals in its internal organs. One study found that many metals are low in concentration in the blubber of narwhals, and high in the liver and the kidney. Zinc and cadmium are found in higher densities in the kidney than the liver, and lead, copper, and mercury were found to be the opposite. Certain metals were correlated with size and sex. During growth, it was found that mercury accumulated in the liver, kidney, muscle, and blubber, and that cadmium settled in the blubber. Narwhals are one of the most vulnerable Arctic marine mammals to climate change due to altering sea ice coverage in their environment, especially in their northern wintering grounds such as the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait regions. Satellite data collected from these areas shows the amount of sea ice has been markedly reduced. Narwhals' ranges for foraging are believed to be patterns developed early in their life which increase their ability to gain necessary food resources during winter. This strategy focuses on strong site fidelity rather than individual level responses to local prey distribution and this results in focal foraging areas during the winter. As such, despite changing conditions, narwhals will continue returning to the same areas during migration. Despite its vulnerability to sea ice change, the narwhal has some flexibility when it comes to sea ice and habitat selection. It evolved in the late Pliocene, and so is moderately accustomed to periods of glaciation and environmental variability. An indirect danger for narwhals associated with changes in sea ice is the increased exposure in open water. In 2002 there was an increase in narwhal catches by hunters in Siorapaluk that did not appear to be associated with increased effort, implying that climate change may be making the narwhal more vulnerable to harvesting. Scientists urge assessment of population numbers with the assignment of sustainable quotas for stocks and the collaboration of management agreements to ensure local acceptance. Seismic surveys associated with oil exploration have also disrupted normal migration patterns which may also be associated with increased sea ice entrapment. Cultural depictions =In legend= The head of a lance made from a narwhal tusk with a meteorite iron blade In Inuit legend, the narwhal's tusk was created when a woman with a harpoon rope tied around her waist was dragged into the ocean after the harpoon had struck a large narwhal. She was transformed into a narwhal, and her hair, which she was wearing in a twisted knot, became the characteristic spiral narwhal tusk. Some medieval Europeans believed narwhal tusks to be the horns from the legendary unicorn.Daston, Lorraine and Park, Katharine (2001). Wonders and the Order of Nature, 1150‚Äì1750. New York: Zone Books, . As these horns were considered to have magic powers, such as neutralising poison and curing melancholia, Vikings and other northern traders were able to sell them for many times their weight in gold. The tusks were used to make cups that were thought to negate any poison that may have been slipped into the drink. A narwhal tusk exhibited at Warwick Castle is according to legend the rib of the mythical Dun Cow. In 1555, Olaus Magnus published a drawing of a fish-like creature with a horn on its forehead, correctly identifying it as a \\"Narwal\\". During the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I received a carved and bejewelled narwhal tusk worth 10,000 pounds sterling‚Äîthe 16th-century equivalent cost of a castle (approximately ¬£1.5‚Äì2.5 million in 2007, using the retail price index)‚Äìfrom Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who proposed the tusk was from a \\"sea-unicorne\\". The tusks were staples of the cabinet of curiosities. European knowledge of the tusk's origin developed gradually during the Age of Exploration, as explorers and naturalists began to visit Arctic regions themselves. =In literature and art= Image of narwhal from Brehms Tierleben (1864‚Äì1869) The narwhal was one of two possible explanations of the giant sea phenomenon written by Jules Verne in his 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Verne thought that it would be unlikely that there was such a gigantic narwhal in existence. The size of the narwhal, or \\"unicorn of the sea\\", as found by Verne, would have been . For the narwhal to have caused the phenomenon, Verne stated that its size and strength would have to increase by five or ten times. Herman Melville wrote a section on the narwhal (written as \\"narwhale\\") in his 1851 novel Moby-Dick, in which he claims a narwhal tusk hung for \\"a long period\\" in Windsor Castle after Sir Martin Frobisher had given it to Queen Elizabeth. Another claim he made was that the Danish kings made their thrones from narwhal tusks.

It is the ease by which people living in a time or place are able to satisfy their needs and/or wants. The idea of a 'standard' may be contrasted with the quality of life, which takes into account not only the material standard of living, but also other more intangible aspects that make up human life, such as leisure, safety, cultural resources, social life, physical health, environmental quality issues. More complex means of measuring well-being must be employed to make such judgments, and these are very often political and controversial.

As a package is being installed, its source code is automatically downloaded, compiled, and installed. Source Mage is descended from Sorcerer. Notable features Source Mage is, as its name suggests, a source-based Linux distribution. Instead of delivering binaries to users, the source code is compiled.New to Source Mage - official website This method allows greater control over the software than precompiled distributions, such as Ubuntu. Individual dependencies can be selected or deselected, saving valuable hard drive space and freeing RAM and CPU cycles. For instance, OpenSSH can be compiled without support for X11 sharing. One can choose to set cflags, cxxflags, and ldflags specific to their situation. Using a source-based distribution is one way to unlock the full performance of a computer, as many binary distros compile their software for a wide audience, not a particular group, such as users of a specific processor. When a Source Mage spell is \\"cast\\", the latest stable release is downloaded from the developer's site rather than Source Mage's. This allows for the most up-to- date system, unlike Gentoo, another popular source-based distribution, which maintains its own customized cache of packages.Comparison with Gentoo - official website SMGL changes as little as possible in packages (only to fit to bare standards such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard), so it is more immune from the kind of errors resulting from distribution developers tampering. History In 2000, Kyle Sallee released a Linux distribution named Sorcerer GNU/Linux. Due to several issues, in 2002, Chuck S. Mead forked Sorcerer into Lunar Linux. Soon afterwards, Kyle Sallee took Sorcerer GNU/Linux offline. The remaining Sorcerer GNU/Linux development team brought it back online and continued development. A month later, Kyle Sallee brought his version of Sorcerer back online with a new license that prevented forking, dropping GNU/Linux from the name. Consequently, at the request of Sallee, the Sorcerer GNU/Linux team renamed their project Source Mage.History - official website Compiling Source Mage's tagline is \\"Linux so advanced, it may as well be magic\\",Sorcery - official website and its commands have a \\"sorcerous theme\\". Each package is called a \\"spell\\", and its package management program is called \\"sorcery\\". To install a package the user must \\"cast\\" that spell. Casting a spell consists of downloading the source code (if it is not already downloaded), checking for dependencies, casting them if necessary, compiling the program, and installing it. A set of available spells is called a \\"grimoire\\". To uninstall a package the user must \\"dispel\\" the spell. Social contract Source Mage has established a distribution commitment. Source Mage Social Contract establishes its basic rules, which are similar though not identical to Debian's. The first part of the contract ensures the freedom of Source Mage: Source Mage does not restrict the user's choice of software to only free software: Installation Installing Source Mage involves first creating a minimal installation with a kernel (so it can run), the GCC C compiler, a network connection, and a few other basic tools to support downloading and compiling source code.Install Source Mage - official website This enables the system to download, compile, and install all the other components, and the compilation results can be tailored for that specific system. Portability All Source Mage-maintained code is designed to presume a minimal system, and the base system doesn't explicitly require a C++ compiler (Only GCC 4.x+ does, but can be replaced). Besides POSIX-compliant tools, core components require only bash, sed and either gawk or mawk, instead of more heavyweight languages like Perl or Python.

In 1922 he was elected the second President of the Republic of Poland following the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz. He was ousted by the May Coup d'√âtat of 1926. While a student at the University of Warsaw, Wojciechowski worked for the Polish Socialist movement, which at the time was a major force in the Polish independence effort. He was arrested by czarist police in 1891, and again in 1892. Upon his release he moved to Zurich, then to Paris and finally to London. In England he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical Przed≈õwit (\\"The Dawn\\"). Active in the socialist movement, he often travelled undercover to Russian Poland, and became friends with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning to Poland legally in 1906 he spent time working to develop Polish cooperatives. During World War I he considered Imperial Germany to be Poland‚Äôs main enemy. With the Russian evacuation in 1915, he moved to Moscow, and there in 1917 was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties' Union. He returned to Warsaw after the October Revolution and from January 1919 to July 1920 served as minister of the interior in two separate cabinets of the new Second Polish Republic. When the Republic's president Gabriel Narutowicz was assassinated in December 1922, Wojciechowski was chosen to succeed him. During his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend military chief of staff Pi≈Çsudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation: Wojciechowski supported continued parliamentary government, while Pi≈Çsudski favoured a more authoritarian approach. In May 1926, due to the worsening economic issues of the country, Pi≈Çsudski staged the successful May Coup, after which Wojciechowski resigned from his post.Zygmunt Kaczmarek, Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Zawodowych, 1988), p. 167  Biography  = Early life = Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski was born on 15 March 1869 in Kalisz into a Polish noble family with strong ties to the intelligentsia. He was one of seven children of Second Lieutenant Feliks Wojciechowski (1825-1881), a caretaker of a prison in Kalisz who participated during the January Uprising, and his wife Florentyna Vorhoff. He was raised in a spirit of patriotism and devotion to his homeland. In 1888, he graduated in the Men's Classical Junior High School in Kalisz and began his studies at the Imperial University of Warsaw where he studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics until 1891. He belonged to the circle of the most active conspirators, participant of the secret student groups for self-improvement. Wojciechowski was active during his studies, first in the conspiratorial organization Association of the Polish Youth \\"Zet\\", and later in the burgeoning socialist movement. By 1892, he had abandoned his studies and chose the life of an exile after his second arrest and detention by the czarist police, first going to Zurich and then Paris. There he learned the trade of typesetter with which he supported himself. In 1892, Wojciechowski co-founded the Polish Socialist Party and many nationalist and socialists met in Paris where they participated in the following year, on the first, illegally organized party conference in Vilnius, where he met Pi≈Çsudski. In 1893, after he was deported from France. He found his new centre of life in London, where he worked as a typesetter, printer, journalist and publisher. He travelled several more times illegally to Congress Poland and the Russian Empire and smuggled printing machine components and publications into the country. Together with Pi≈Çsudski, he formed the backbone of the socialist movement in Russian Poland. In 1899, he married Maria Wojciechowska, a daughter of a wealthy landowner of szlachta descent.Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski, \\"Moje wspomnienia\\" (Warszawa‚ÄìLw√≥w: KsiƒÖ≈ºnica-Atlas, 1938), pp. 53‚Äì55, 130 = Political movements and career = After 1905, he left the Polish Socialist Party over disagreements on the political future of Poland and its relations to the international class struggle. After the amnesty in 1906, he returned to Warsaw and took part in the cooperative movement by Edward Abramowski. During World War I, Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski believed that Germany posed the biggest threat to Poland and thus decided to stay in Russia rather than side with his erstwhile friend Pi≈Çsudski. After the Russian evacuation of Congress Poland of 1915, he moved to Moscow where he remained active in Polish political circles. After the fall of the Tsarist regime was elected President of the Council of Polish Parties' Union, and heavily engaged on behalf of the Polish Army in Russia in 1918. He was forced to leave Moscow under threat of arrest once the Bolshevik regime seized power. On 15 January 1919, the Chief of State nominated him, Minister of Internal Affairs, in both the Cabinet of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Leopold Skulski, whom Wojciechowski replaced during his numerous absences from the country. During this time, Wojciechowski also participated in the drafting of the Polish constitution.Zygmunt Kaczmarek, Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy ZwiƒÖzk√≥w Zawodowych, 1988), pp. 114‚Äì119  Presidency: 1922-1926 =1922 Presidential elections= First election In the legislative elections, Wojciechowski served as the candidate for the Senate though he failed to win a seat. After the legislative elections, a balance appeared between the left and right forces. This situation also preponderated in the National Assembly, which was to select a new President of Poland and produce a new presidential election. Pi≈Çsudski did not want to put up his candidacy, and Wincenty Witos was perceived as a person communicating with the right and not paying attention to the interests of rural villages. Therefore, the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" put forward and appointed Wojciechowski as the new candidate for the presidency not involved in current political games. He accepted this decision, but when the Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\" informed that Gabriel Narutowicz planned to withdraw from the presidential race. Witos persuaded Narutowicz not to do that. Wojciechowski was defeated in the fourth ballot to the landowner Count Maurycy Zamoyski who received 228 votes and Wojciechowski only reached 152 votes. Ate the time of the elections, the main candidates were Zamoyski and Wojciechowski. Narutowicz's good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of \\"Piast\\" (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round). Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the National Democracy movement), and of the centrist Polish People‚Äôs Party \\"Piast\\". This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first President of the Second Polish Republic. Second election Following the assassination of President Narutowicz by the ultra-nationalist painter Eligiusz Niewiadomski on 16 December 1922, Marshal of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, who served briefly as acting head of state after the assassination, set the date of a new presidential election on 20 December 1922. The right-wings put forward the candidacy of Professor Kazimierz Morawski. Wojciechowski was nominated again as a compromise candidate and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski. Originally, Witos recommended his own party vote for Morawski. The left-wing opposed this and decided to vote for Wojciechowski, however, in connection with the events that led to the murder of Narutowicz. As a result of the internal party discussion, it was decided to support Wojciechowski's candidacy. In the first round, Wojciechowski secured 298 votes, with Morawski only gaining 221 votes, Wojciechowski won the election and became the second President of Poland. After the election, representatives of the National Assembly appeared in Wojciechowski's residence to notify him about his election as President. He considered that the will of the Sejm and the Senate should be followed. Alfons Erdman appeared at Wojciechowski's office and demanded him to abstain from accepting his choice. It was nevertheless too late, Wojciechowski decided that delay in this matter was improper. On 20 December 1922, Wojciechowski took the presidential oath and became President. =Tenure= During his presidency, Wojciechowski attempted to be an enthusiastic politician, who was involved in the performance of the government. He actively supported the non-parliamentary ministry of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski. The height of the president's political influence corresponded with Grabski's cabinet period of activity. Wojciechowski participated in the Political Committee of the Council of Ministers and had an impact on the content of ordinances on the currency reform, created under special powers of attorney granted to the cabinet by the Sejm. Wojciechowski attempted to shape the Polish constitutional system by introducing a constructive vote of no confidence. The mission of forming a new government was entrusted to the leader of the largest group participating in the overthrow of the previous cabinet, and when Wojciechowski failed to select a cabinet, he advocated leaving the old cabinet or establishing a non- parliamentary cabinet. Wojciechowski used this method after the fall of the second cabinet of Wincenty Witos when he committed the purpose of setting a new ministry to Stanis≈Çaw Thugutt. Another indication of Wojciechowski's constitutional system was the adoption, opposite to the provisions of the constitution that the Sejm was assembling enduringly, and not in the session system. Wojciechowski never closed the session of the Sejm, which was dictated by the constitution. Wojciechowski tried to maintain good relations with J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who was in perpetual dispute with the succeeding cabinets and some parliamentary groups. The reason for the conflict was the organization of military authorities. Pi≈Çsudski always saw Wojciechowski as a person who would take his side. When in June 1923, Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki addressed to the Sejm a bill on the highest military authorities, announcing the liquidation of the powerful military council, who Pi≈Çsudski served as the chairman, flared up a sharp dispute between him and the Marshal. Wojciechowski tried to settle this dispute. Accordingly, Pi≈Çsudski sent a letter to the president in which he addressed him with the words \\"You have acted as a hangover in the matter of honour, which does not respect the rights of honour and forgets that honour belongs to people personally, not officially.\\" Wojciechowski tried to negotiate between the opposing parties, including took into account the Maciej Rataj's commentaries, who objected to committing the position of Minister of Military Affairs to Sikorski. Pi≈Çsudski did not want to compromise and treated Wojciechowski, as what Rataj regarded, defiantly and as a servant. On 5 September 1924, Wojciechowski visited the Polish city of Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine). At the end of Kopernika and Legion√≥w Street, an explosive charge was thrown towards the car where the president was travelling. Fortuitously, the bomb did not explode and the assassin was arrested. The suspect of the assassination was Teofil Olszewski from the Ukrainian Military Organization, who tried to illegally cross the German border near Bytom and was arrested by the Germans when on 3 October 1924. Olszewski was convicted of crossing the border illegally for two weeks in prison, suspended for one year, and then granted political refugee status in Germany and permission to settle in Marienburg (Malbork), close to the Polish border. It was believed that the assassin was Stanis≈Çaw Steiger, an employee of a commercial company and a student of Jewish law, was responsible. The man was arrested and imprisoned throughout the trial. He was threatened with the death penalty, but then the new circumstances of the assassination came to light. The first trial against Steiger took place on 15 and 16 September 1924 ere the District Court in Lviv. The prosecutor was Alfred Laniewski, and the defender was lawyer Micha≈Ç Grek. The Regional Court referred the case to ordinary proceedings with the participation of sworn judges. In the proceedings, Steiger was defended by lawyer Natan Loewenstein. The trial during which Loewenstein gave his defence speech did not take place until 16 December 1925. Steiger spent all this time in custody. Gratitude to the lawyer's speech, which Loewenstein published in Lviv a year later, the accused was cleared of the charges and acquitted. On 7 May 1925, Wojciechowski travelled from Warsaw to Krak√≥w with the entire ceremonial held by the president. After receiving a report at the station from the commander of the honour company, Wojciechowski asked him if the soldiers were singing religious songs. After receiving a proof answer, Wojciechowski instructed the soldiers to sing some of them. They sang for about twenty minutes until the train left. Such behaviour of the president caused an understandable sensation in the country. =Fall from power= In November 1925, the government of Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski was replaced by the government of Aleksander Skrzy≈Ñski, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party. General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski became the new government's minister of military affairs. However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, formed by Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" and Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d'√©tat. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on 16 October. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was \\"ready to fight the evil\\" of sejmocracy and promised a \\"sanation\\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities. The night of 11 to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembert√≥w, where they pledged their support to Pi≈Çsudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wis≈Ça River. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos' government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Pi≈Çsudski met Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Major Marian Porwit who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Pi≈Çsudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Pi≈Çsudski demanded the resignation of Witos' cabinet, while the President demanded Pi≈Çsudski's capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president's departure, Major Porwit refused Pi≈Çsudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos' cabinet decided to move from Belweder to Wilan√≥w. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. After transferring to Wilan√≥w, Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to Pozna≈Ñ and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Pi≈Çsudski as the new Minister of Military Affairs. On 31 May 1926, the National Assembly nominated Pi≈Çsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mo≈õcicki became the new president; Pi≈Çsudski, however, wielded much greater de facto power than his military ministry nominally gave him.  Later life  =Scientific career= Following the resignation, Wojciechowski worked as a lecturer at the Warsaw School of Economics and the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. Wojciechowski served as the Director of the Cooperative Scientific Institute and later sat on the Scientific Council of the Institute. He published hermetic publications on cooperative activity, which he engaged in before he became an active politician. He wrote books such as the Organization of Agricultural Products Sales and the History of Polish Cooperatives until 1914. In 1937, he was the co-founder of the opposition Labor Party. =Second World War= On 10 November 1939, the Gestapo arrested Wojciehowski's son, Edmund as part of German AB-Aktion in Poland, he was threatened with execution, as were other representatives of the Polish intelligentsia caught on the streets. He was later released on 4 April 1940 because of Jerzy Antoni Potocki, a former adjacent of Jozef Pi≈Çsudski. He later arrested on 12 July 1940 again because he was one of the 70 Warsaw lawyers who did not agree to remove Jewish associates from the Bar Council. The Germans offered his release in exchange for Wojciechowski signing a declaration stating that the Polish government-in- exile was constitutionally illegal. Wojciechowski refused to sign the declaration and Edmund was transferred on 15 August 1940 to the Auschwitz as one of the 1666 people of the first transport from Warsaw, where he soon died of typhus on 23 February 1941. The family received a telegram sent from the concentration camp informing Wojciechowski about his son's passing, and soon an urn of ashes containing the remains of Edmund was sent back to his parents. During the Warsaw Uprising, the ill Wojciechowski along with his wife Maria was rounded up by the Nazis and sent to the Durchgangslager 121, a transit camp in Pruszk√≥w. Death Wojciechowski retired to private life and died in Go≈ÇƒÖbki (now Ursus) in 1953, at the age of 84. He was buried in PowƒÖzki in Warsaw. Until the end of his life, he was convinced that everything has been bad in the history of Poland since the May Coup. Legacy Wojciechowski experienced a political life similar to that of many Central European politicians during the early 20th century. A radical in his youth, his ideology matured and grew more conservative with age. He was at the forefront of over a quarter-century of Polish political development and is considered one of the founders of the modern independent Polish state. Historians unanimously indicate that Wojciechowski remains a figure greatly underrated and believe that it should be remembered that his presidency fell on a particularly turbulent period in Polish history. He managed to make history as an outstanding politician and statesman and will last in history as a relentless defender of democratic values and a prominent patriot.

With a career spanning nearly seven decades, Lee was well known for portraying villains and became best known for his role as Count Dracula in a sequence of Hammer Horror films. His other film roles include Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (2002‚Äì2005), and Saruman in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001‚Äì2003) and the Hobbit film trilogy (2012‚Äì2014). Lee was knighted for services to drama and charity in 2009, received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2011, and received the BFI Fellowship in 2013.*\\"Hammer Horror star Lee knighted\\". BBC. Retrieved 7 May 2012 * \\"Christopher Lee to receive Bafta Fellowship\\". BBC. Retrieved 7 May 2012 * \\"Depp surprises Sir Christopher Lee with film award\\". BBC. Retrieved 14 December 2013 Lee credited three films ‚Äúfor bringing me to the fore‚Äù as an actor, A Tale of Two Cities (1958), in which he played the villainous marquis, and two horror films, The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958). He considered his best performance to be that of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the biopic Jinnah (1998), and his best film to be the British cult film The Wicker Man (1973). He frequently appeared opposite his friend Peter Cushing in many horror films, and late in his career had roles in five Tim Burton films. Prior to his acting career, Lee served in the Royal Air Force, where he was attached to the No. 260 Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer where he was a liaison officer for the Special Operations Executive, although he was unlikely to have been behind enemy lines. Following his World War II service he retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant. Always noted as an actor for his deep, strong voice, Lee was also known for his singing ability, recording various opera and musical pieces between 1986 and 1998, and the symphonic metal album Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross in 2010, after having worked with several metal bands since 2005. The heavy metal follow-up Charlemagne: The Omens of Death was released on 27 May 2013, Lee's 91st birthday. He was honoured with the \\"Spirit of Metal\\" award at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards ceremony.  Early life  Lee was born in Belgravia, London, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Trollope Lee (1879‚Äì1941) of the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, and his wife, Countess Estelle Marie (n√©e Carandini di Sarzano; 1889‚Äì1981). Lee's father fought in the Boer War and First World War, and his mother was an Edwardian beauty who was painted by Sir John Lavery, Oswald Birley, and Olive Snell, and sculpted by Clare Sheridan; her lineage can be traced to Charlemagne. Lee's maternal great-grandfather was an Italian political refugee whose wife, Lee's great-grandmother, was English-born opera singer Marie Carandini (n√©e Burgess). He had one sister, Xandra Carandini Lee (1917‚Äì2002). Lee's parents separated when he was four and divorced two years later. During this time, his mother took his sister and him to Wengen in Switzerland. After enrolling in Miss Fisher's Academy in Territet, he played his first role, as Rumpelstiltskin. They then returned to London, where Lee attended Wagner's private school in Queen's Gate, and his mother married Harcourt George St- Croix Rose, a banker and uncle of Ian Fleming. Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, thus became Lee's step-cousin. The family moved to Fulham, living next door to the actor Eric Maturin. One night, he was introduced to Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, the assassins of Grigori Rasputin, whom Lee was to play many years later. When Lee was nine, he was sent to Summer Fields School, a preparatory school in Oxford whose pupils often later attended Eton. He continued acting in school plays, though \\"the laurels deservedly went to Patrick Macnee.\\" Lee applied for a scholarship to Eton, where his interview was in the presence of the ghost story author M. R. James. Sixty years later, Lee played the part of James for the BBC. His poor maths skills meant that he placed eleventh, and thus missed out on being a King's Scholar by one place. His step-father was not prepared to pay the higher fees that being an Oppidan Scholar meant, and so he did not attend. Instead, Lee attended Wellington College, where he won scholarships in the classics, studying Ancient Greek and Latin. Aside from a \\"tiny part\\" in a school play, he didn't act while at Wellington. He was a \\"passable\\" racquets player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played: hockey, football, rugby and boxing. He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always \\"play dead\\" as soon as possible during mock battles. Lee was frequently beaten at school, including once at Wellington for \\"being beaten too often,\\" though he accepted them as \\"logical and therefore acceptable\\" punishments for knowingly breaking the rules. At age 17, and with one year left at Wellington, the summer term of 1939 was his last. His step- father had gone bankrupt, owing ¬£25,000. His mother separated from Rose, and Lee had to get a job, his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board. With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee, and so he was sent to the French Riviera, where his sister was on holiday with friends. On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris, where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller, a friend of Rose, and witnessed Eugen Weidmann's execution by guillotine ‚Äì the last public execution performed in France. Arriving in Menton, he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family, living among exiled princely families. It was arranged that he should stay on in Menton after his sister had returned home, but with Europe on the brink of war, he returned to London instead. He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines, taking care of the mail and running errands. Military service during the Second World War When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Lee had enrolled in a military academy and volunteered to fight for the Finnish Army against the Soviet Union during the Winter War. He and other British volunteers were kept away from the actual fighting, but they were issued winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the border. After two weeks in Finland, they returned home. In a later interview, Lee stated that he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator. When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force. Lee reported to RAF Uxbridge for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at Paignton. After he had passed his exams in Liverpool, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan meant that he travelled on the Reina del Pacifico to South Africa, then to his posting at Hillside, at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia. Training with de Havilland Tiger Moths, Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight, when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision. The medical officer hesitantly diagnosed a failure of his optic nerve, and he was told he would never be allowed to fly again. Lee was devastated, and the death of a fellow trainee from Summer Fields only made him more despondent. His appeals were fruitless, and he was left with nothing to do. He was moved around to different flying stations before being posted to Southern Rhodesia's capital, Salisbury, in December 1941. He then visited the Mazowe Dam, Marandellas, the Wankie Game Reserve and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. Thinking he should \\"do something constructive for my keep,\\" he applied to join RAF Intelligence. His superiors praised his initiative, and he was seconded into the British South Africa Police and was posted as a warder at Salisbury Prison. He was then promoted to leading aircraftman and moved to Durban in South Africa, before travelling to Suez on the Nieuw Amsterdam. After \\"killing time\\" at RAF Kasfareet near the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone, he resumed intelligence work in the city of Isma√Ølia. He was then attached to No. 205 Group RAF before being commissioned as a pilot officer at the end of January 1943, and attached to No. 260 Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer. As the North African Campaign progressed, the squadron \\"leapfrogged\\" between Egyptian airstrips, from RAF El Daba to Maaten Bagush and on to Mersa Matruh. They lent air support to the ground forces and bombed strategic targets. Lee, \\"broadly speaking, was expected to know everything.\\" The Allied advance continued into Libya, through Tobruk and Benghazi to the Marble Arch and then through El Agheila, Khoms and Tripoli, with the squadron averaging five missions a day. As the advance continued into Tunisia, with the Axis forces digging themselves in at the Mareth Line, Lee was almost killed when the squadron's airfield was bombed. After breaking through the Mareth Line, the squadron made their final base in Kairouan. After the Axis surrender in North Africa in May 1943, the squadron moved to Zuwarah in Libya in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily. They then moved to Malta, and, after its capture by the British Eighth Army, the Sicilian town of Pachino, before making a permanent base in Agnone Bagni. At the end of July 1943, Lee received his second promotion of the year, this time to flying officer. After the Sicilian campaign was over, Lee came down with malaria for the sixth time in under a year, and was flown to a hospital in Carthage for treatment. When he returned, the squadron was restless, frustrated with a lack of news about the Eastern Front and the Soviet Union in general, and with no mail from home or alcohol. Unrest spread and threatened to turn into mutiny. Lee, by now an expert on Russia, talked them into resuming their duties, which much impressed his commanding officer. Flying Officer C. F. C. Lee in Vatican City, 1944, soon after the Liberation of Rome After the Allied invasion of Italy, the squadron was based in Foggia and Termoli during the winter of 1943. Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officer's swap scheme. He spent most of this time with the Gurkhas of the 8th Indian Infantry Division during the Battle of Monte Cassino. While spending some time on leave in Naples, Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius, which erupted three days later. During the final assault on Monte Cassino, the squadron was based in San Angelo, and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff, and he tripped over one of its live bombs. After the battle, the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome, and Lee visited the city, where he met his mother's cousin, Nicol√≤ Carandini, who had fought in the Italian resistance movement. In November 1944, Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ. Lee took part in forward planning and liaison, in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress. After the war ended, Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in P√∂rtschach am W√∂rthersee. For the final few months of his service, Lee, who spoke fluent French, Italian and German, among other languages, was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects. Here, he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals. Of his time with the organisation, Lee said: \\"We were given dossiers of what they'd done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority ... We saw these concentration camps. Some had been cleaned up. Some had not.\\" He retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant. Lee's stepfather served as a captain in the Intelligence Corps, but it is unlikely he had any influence over Lee's military career. Lee saw him for the last time on a bus in London in 1940, by then divorced from Lee's mother, though Lee did not speak to him. Lee mentioned that during the war he was attached to the Special Operations Executive and the Long Range Desert Group, the precursor of the SAS,Lord of the Rings DVD, audio commentary but always declined to go into details.  Career  = 1947‚Äì1957: Career beginnings = Returning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's, with a significant raise, but he turned them down as \\"I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind.\\" The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews. During lunch with his cousin Nicol√≤ Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, \\"Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?\\" Lee liked the idea, and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia (which included his great- grandmother Marie Carandini, who had been a successful opera singer), he met Nicol√≤'s friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer.

Lee had a single line, \\"a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead's bravura.\\" His \\"apprenticeship\\" lasted ten years, as he mostly played supporting and background characters. Also in this early period, he made an uncredited appearance in Laurence Olivier's film version of Hamlet (1948), as a spear carrier (his later co-star and close friend Peter Cushing played Osric). A few years later, he appeared in Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951) as a Spanish captain. He was cast when the director asked him if he could speak Spanish and fence, which he was able to do. Lee appeared uncredited in the American epic Quo Vadis (also 1951), which was shot in Rome, playing a chariot driver and was injured when he was thrown from it at one point during the shoot. He recalled that his breakthrough came in 1952, when Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. began making films at the British National Studios. He said in 2006, \\"I was cast in various roles in 16 of them and even appeared with Buster Keaton and it proved an excellent training ground.\\" The same year, he appeared in John Huston's Oscar-nominated Moulin Rouge. Throughout the next decade, he made nearly 30 films, including Cockleshell Heroes, playing mostly stock action characters. = 1957‚Äì1976: Work with Hammer = Lee as the title character in Dracula (1958).

Lee returned to the role of Dracula in Hammer's Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1965). Lee's role has no lines, he merely hisses his way through the film. Stories vary as to the reason for this: Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given, but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character. This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film's running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula's resurrection and the character's appearances were brief. Lee went on record to state that he was virtually \\"blackmailed\\" by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films; unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate, they would resort to reminding him of how many people he would put out of work, if he did not take part. His roles in the films Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), and Scars of Dracula (1970) all gave the Count very little to do. Lee said in an interview in 2005, \\"all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear when you see the films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. Occasionally, I sneaked one in.\\" Although Lee may not have liked what Hammer was doing with the character, worldwide audiences embraced the films, which were all commercially successful. Lee starred in two further Dracula films for Hammer in the early 1970s, both of which attempted to bring the character into the modern-day era. These were not commercially successful: Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) and The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973). The latter film was tentatively titled Dracula Is Dead... and Well and Living in London, a parody of the stage and film musical revue Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, but Lee was not amused. Speaking at a press conference in 1973 to announce the film, Lee said, \\"I'm doing it under protest... I think it is fatuous. I can think of twenty adjectives ‚Äì fatuous, pointless, absurd. It's not a comedy, but it's got a comic title. I don't see the point.\\" The Satanic Rites of Dracula was the last Dracula film that Christopher Lee played the Dracula role in, as he felt he had played the part too many times and that the Dracula films had deteriorated in quality.Sir Christopher Lee In His Own Words. Empire [online]. Published 12 June 2015. Retrieved 22 March 2016. Author ‚Äì Owen Williams. Hammer went on to make one more Dracula film without him: The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974), with John Forbes-Robertson playing the Count and David de Keyser dubbing him. In all, Lee played Dracula ten times: seven films for Hammer Productions, once for Jesse Franco's Count Dracula (1970), uncredited in Jerry Lewis's One More Time (1970) and √âdouard Molinaro's Dracula and Son (1976). Lee's other work for Hammer included The Mummy (1959). Lee portrayed Rasputin in Rasputin, the Mad Monk (1966) and Sir Henry Baskerville (to Cushing's Sherlock Holmes) in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959). Lee later played Holmes himself in 1962's Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace, and returned to Holmes films with Billy Wilder's British-made The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970), in which he plays Sherlock's smarter brother, Mycroft. Lee considers this film to be the reason he stopped being typecast: \\"I've never been typecast since. Sure, I've played plenty of heavies, but as Anthony Hopkins says, \\"I don't play villains, I play people.\\"\\" Lee played a leading role in the German film The Puzzle of the Red Orchid (1962), speaking German, which he had learned during his education in Switzerland. He auditioned for a part in the film The Longest Day (1962), but was turned down because he did not \\"look like a military man.\\" Some film books incorrectly credit him with a role in the film, something he had to correct for the rest of his life. Lee's friend Dennis Wheatley, a noted author, was responsible for bringing the occult to him. The company made two films from Wheatley's novels, both starring Lee. The first, The Devil Rides Out (1967), is generally considered to be one of Hammer's crowning achievements. According to Lee, Wheatley was so pleased with it, that he offered the actor the film rights to his remaining black magic novels, free of charge. However, the second film, To the Devil a Daughter (1976), was fraught with production difficulties and was disowned by its author. Although financially successful, it was Hammer's last horror film, and marked the end of Lee's long association with the studio that had a major impact on his career. = Various roles: The Wicker Man and James Bond = The Oblong Box (1969) Like Cushing, Lee also appeared in horror films for other companies during the 20-year period from 1957 to 1977. Other films in which Lee performed include the series of Fu Manchu films made between 1965 and 1969, in which he starred as the villain in heavy oriental make-up; I, Monster (1971), in which he played Jekyll and Hyde; The Creeping Flesh (1972); and his personal favourite, The Wicker Man (1973), in which he played Lord Summerisle. Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centring on \\"old religion,\\" in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day. Shaffer read the David Pinner novel Ritual, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner ¬£15,000 for the rights to the novel, and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay. However, he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, and began to craft a new story, using only the basic outline of the novel. Lee was so keen to get the film made, he gave his services for free, as the budget was so small. He would later refer to the film as the best he had ever made. Lee appeared as the on-screen narrator in Jess Franco's Eugenie (1970) as a favour to producer Harry Alan Towers, unaware that it was softcore pornography, as the sex scenes were shot separately. Lee and his close friend Peter Cushing in Horror Express (1972) In addition to making films in the United Kingdom, Lee made films in mainland Europe: he appeared in two German films, Count Dracula (1970), where he again played the vampire count, and The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism (1967). Other films in Europe he made include Castle of the Living Dead (1964) and Horror Express (1972). Lee was a producer of the horror film Nothing But the Night (also 1972), in which he also starred. It was the first and last film he ever produced, as he did not enjoy the process. Lee appeared as the Comte de Rochefort in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers (1973). He was wounded in his left knee during filming, an injury he still felt many years later. He also appeared in the sequel film The Four Musketeers (1974), which was actually shot at the same time. Although \\"killed\\" in the latter film, he reprised the role in The Return of the Musketeers (1989), with his character given token dialogue explaining that his wound in the earlier film's climactic sword fight wasn't fatal. After the mid-1970s, Lee eschewed horror roles almost entirely. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond spy novels and Lee's step-cousin, had offered him the role of the titular antagonist in the first Eon-produced Bond film Dr. No (1962). Lee enthusiastically accepted, but by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role. Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), in which he was cast as the deadly assassin Francisco Scaramanga. Lee said of his performance, \\"In Fleming's novel he's just a West Indian thug, but in the film he's charming, elegant, amusing, lethal... I played him like the dark side of Bond.\\" Because of his filming schedule in Bangkok, film director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play the Specialist in Tommy (1975). That role was eventually given to Jack Nicholson. In an AMC documentary on Halloween (1978), John Carpenter states that he offered the role of Samuel Loomis to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, before Donald Pleasence took the role. Years later, Lee met Carpenter, and told him that the biggest regret of his career was not taking the role of Dr. Loomis. Lee appeared on the cover of the Wings album Band on the Run (1973), along with others including chat show host Michael Parkinson, singer Kenny Lynch, film actor James Coburn, world boxing champion John Conteh, and broadcaster Clement Freud. = 1977: Move to Hollywood = In 1977, Lee left the UK for the US, concerned at being typecast in horror films, as had happened to his close friends Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. He said in an interview in 2011: His first American film was the disaster film Airport '77 (1977). In 1978, Lee surprised many people with his willingness to go along with a joke, by appearing as guest host on NBC's Saturday Night Live. As a result of his appearance on SNL, Steven Spielberg, who was in the audience, cast him in 1941 (1979). Meanwhile, Lee co-starred with Bette Davis in the Disney film Return from Witch Mountain (1978). He turned down the role of Dr. Barry Rumack (finally played by Leslie Nielsen) in the disaster spoof Airplane! (1980), a decision he later called \\"a big mistake.\\" Lee appeared in The Return of Captain Invincible (1982), a comedy-musical film. Lee sings on two tracks in the film (\\"Name Your Poison\\" and \\"Mister Midnight\\"), written by Richard O'Brien (who had written The Rocky Horror Picture Show seven years previously) and Richard Hartley. Later, he appeared alongside Reb Brown and Sybil Danning in Howling II: Your Sister Is a Werewolf (1985). Lee made his last appearances as Sherlock Holmes in Incident at Victoria Falls (1991) and Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (1992). Lee at the Aubagne International Film Festival in September 1996 In addition to more than a dozen feature films together for Hammer Films, Amicus Productions, and other companies, Lee and Peter Cushing both appeared in Hamlet (1948) and Moulin Rouge (1952), albeit in separate scenes; and in separate instalments of the Star Wars films: Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original film and Lee decades later as Count Dooku. The last project which united them in person was a documentary, Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror (1994), which they jointly narrated. It was the last time they saw each other, as Cushing died two months later. In 1998, Lee starred in the role of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, in the film Jinnah. In 2002, while talking about his favourite role in film at a press conference at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, he declared that his role in Jinnah was his best performance and called Muhammad Ali Jinnah \\"an incorruptible man of great integrity and vision.\\" Lee was considered for the role of comic book villain/hero Magneto in the screen adaptation of the popular comic book series X-Men, but he lost the role to Sir Ian McKellen, his co-star in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. = 2000s: The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars = Forbidden Planet New Oxford Street, London, signing The Two Towers in January 2008 He had many television roles, including that of Flay in the BBC television miniseries, based on Mervyn Peake's novels, Gormenghast (2000), and Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski in the CBS film John Paul the Second (2005). He played Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in the BBC/A&E; co-production of Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (1997). He played a role in the made-for-TV series La R√©volution fran√ßaise (1989) in part 2, \\"Les Ann√©es Terribles,\\" as the executioner, Charles-Henri Sanson, who beheaded King Louis XVI, Maximilien de Robespierre, and others. Lee played Saruman in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. In the commentary, he stated he had a decades-long dream to play Gandalf, but that he was now too old, and that his physical limitations prevented him from being considered. The role of Saruman, by contrast, required no horse riding and much less fighting. Lee had met J. R. R. Tolkien once (making him the only person involved in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to have done so) and made a habit of reading the novels at least once a year. In addition, he performed for the album The Lord of the Rings: Songs and Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien in 2003. Lee's appearance in the final film in the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, was cut from the theatrical release, but the scene was reinstated in the extended edition. The Lord of the Rings marked the beginning of a major career revival that continued in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005), in which he played the villainous Count Dooku. He did most of the swordplay himself, though a double was required for the long shots with more vigorous footwork. The Heavy in Westminster, London in 2007 Lee was one of the favourite actors of Tim Burton, and became a regular in many of Burton's films, working for the director five times, starting in 1999, where he had a small role as the Burgomaster in the film Sleepy Hollow. In 2005, Lee played Willy Wonka's strict dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka, in Burton's reimagining of the Roald Dahl tale Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and voiced the character of Pastor Galswells in Corpse Bride, co-directed by Burton and Mike Johnson. In 2007, Lee collaborated with Burton on Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, playing the spirit of Sweeney Todd's victims, called the Gentleman Ghost, alongside Anthony Head, with both singing \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,\\" its reprises and the Epilogue. These songs were recorded, but eventually cut since Burton felt that the songs were too theatrical for the film. Lee's appearance was completely cut from the film, but Head still had an uncredited one-line cameo. In 2008, he was offered the role of King Balor in Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy II: The Golden Army, but had to turn it down due to prior commitments. In late November 2009, Lee narrated the Science Fiction Festival in Trieste, Italy. Also in 2009, Lee starred in Stephen Poliakoff's British period drama Glorious 39 with Julie Christie, Bill Nighy, Romola Garai, and David Tennant, Academy Award-nominated director Danis Tanoviƒá's war film Triage with Colin Farrell and Paz Vega, and Duncan Ward's comedy Boogie Woogie alongside Amanda Seyfried, Gillian Anderson, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Joanna Lumley. = 2010s: Later roles = Lee at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012 In 2010, Lee marked his fourth collaboration with Tim Burton by voicing the Jabberwock in Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic book Alice in Wonderland, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway. While he only had two lines, Burton said that he felt Lee to be a good match for the iconic character, because of Lee himself being \\"an iconic guy.\\" Lee won the \\"Spirit of Metal\\" award in the Metal Hammer Golden Gods 2010. The award was presented by Tony Iommi. In 2010, Lee received the Steiger Award (Germany) and, in February 2011, Lee was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship. In 2011, he appeared in a Hammer film, The Resident, for the first time in thirty-five years, the last being 1976's To the Devil a Daughter. The film was directed by Antti Jokinen, and Lee gave a \\"superbly sinister\\" performance alongside Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Whilst filming scenes for the film in New Mexico in early 2009, Lee injured his back when he tripped over power cables on set. He had to undergo surgery, and as a result, he was unable to play the role of Sir Lachlan Morrison in The Wicker Tree. Very disappointed, director Robin Hardy recast the role, but Lee was determined to appear in the film, so Hardy wrote a small scene specially for him. Lee appears as the unnamed \\"Old Gentleman\\" who acts as Lachlan's mentor in a flashback. Hardy stated that fans of The Wicker Man would recognise this character as Lord Summerisle, but Lee contradicted this, stating that they are two unrelated characters. Also in 2011, Lee appeared in the critically acclaimed Hugo, directed by Martin Scorsese. On 11 January 2011, Lee announced on his website that he would be reprising the role of Saruman for the prequel film The Hobbit. Lee had originally said that he would have liked to have shown Saruman's corruption by Sauron, but that he wouldn't be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age. The production was adjusted to accommodate Lee's travel concerns, thereby allowing him to participate in the film from London. Lee said he worked on his role for the films over the course of four days, portraying Saruman as a kind and noble (if somewhat cantankerous) wizard, before his subsequent fall into darkness, as depicted in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. In 2012, Lee marked his fifth and final collaboration with Tim Burton, by appearing in Burton's film adaptation of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows, in the small role of a New England fishing captain. In an interview in August 2013, Lee said that he was \\"saddened\\" to hear his friend Johnny Depp considering retirement from acting, noting that he himself had no intention of retiring. Lee narrated the feature-length documentary Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics, which was released on 25 October 2013. In 2014, he appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series Timeshift called How to Be Sherlock Holmes: The Many Faces of a Master Detective. Lee and others who had played Sherlock Holmes discussed the character and the various interpretations of him. He also appeared in a web exclusive, reading an excerpt from the short story The Final Problem. He also narrated an advertising campaign for Age UK, reading a poem by Roger McGough. A month before his death, Lee had signed to star with an ensemble cast in the Danish film The 11th. His final performance was the independent Angels of Notting Hill directed by Michael Pakleppa, a comedy about an angel trapped in London who falls in love with a human being. Lee plays The Boss / Mr President and the film premiered in the Regent Street Cinema, London on Saturday 29 October 2016. Lee recorded his final words for film at his Redwood Studios in Soho, London on 17 May 2015 just 3 weeks before his death on 7 June 2015. = Voice work = Lee spoke fluent English, Italian, French, Spanish, and German, and was moderately proficient in Swedish, Russian, and Greek.

Lee provided the off-camera voice of \\"U. N. Owen,\\" the mysterious host who brings disparate characters together in Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians (1965). The film was produced by Harry Alan Towers, for whom Lee had worked repeatedly in the 1960s. Even though he was not credited on the film, his voice is unmistakable. He also provided all the voices for the English dub of Monsieur Hulot's Holiday (1953). He contributed with his voice as Death in the animated versions of Terry Pratchett's Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters, and reprised the role in the Sky1 live action adaptation The Colour of Magic, taking over the role from the late Ian Richardson. Lee provided the voice for the role of Ansem the Wise/DiZ in the video games Kingdom Hearts II, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, and Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, but veteran voice actor Corey Burton (who would also take over for Lee in Star Wars: The Clone Wars) took over for Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, as well as the version of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days that was released as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix. He was the voice of Lucan D'Lere in the trailers for EverQuest II.

The music was arranged by Richie Faulkner from the band Judas Priest, and featured World Guitar Idol Champion, Hedras Ramos. In December 2012, he released an EP of heavy metal covers of Christmas songs called A Heavy Metal Christmas. He released a second in December 2013, entitled A Heavy Metal Christmas Too. With the song \\"Jingle Hell,\\" Lee entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at No. 22, thus becoming the second oldest living performer to ever enter the music charts, at 91 years and 6 months.

Lee was engaged for a time in the late-1950s to Henriette von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm. Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London- based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson. Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Bu√±uel film, and thought they were \\"killing me with cream.\\" Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before while filming Tales of Hans Anderson, where he received his blessing. However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she \\"deserved better\\" than being \\"pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor.\\" She understood, and they called the wedding off. Lee was introduced to Danish painter and former model Birgit \\"Gitte\\" Kr√∏ncke by a Danish friend in 1960. They were engaged soon after, and married on 17 March 1961. They had a daughter, Christina Erika Carandini Lee (b. 1963), Lee was also the uncle of the British actress Dame Harriet Walter. Both Lee and his daughter Christina provided spoken vocals on Rhapsody of Fire's album From Chaos to Eternity. Lee relocated to Los Angeles in the 1970s after becoming disillusioned with film roles he was being offered in Britain at the time and stated that in Hollywood \\"I was no longer a horror star. I was an actor.\\" He subsequently moved back to England and lived with his family in Cadogan Square, London until his death. His Cadogan Square home was briefly featured in the music video accompanying his cover of \\"My Way\\" from his album Revelation. Lee was also known for his imposing height: he was 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall.

Contrary to popular belief, Lee did not have a vast library of occult books. When giving a speech at the University College Dublin on 8 November 2011, he said: \\"Somebody wrote I have 20,000 books. I'd have to live in a bath! I have maybe four or five occult books.\\" He further admonished the students against baneful occult practices, warning them that he had met \\"people who claimed to be Satanists. Who claimed to be involved with black magic.\\" However, he himself had certainly never been involved: \\"I warn all of you: never, never, never.

Although square A appears a darker shade of gray than square B, in the image the two have exactly the same luminance. Drawing a connecting bar between the two squares breaks the illusion and shows that they are the same shade. Gregory's categorization of illusions In this animation, Mach bands exaggerate the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray as soon as they come in contact with one another. An optical illusion (also called a visual illusionIn the scientific literature the term \\"visual illusion\\" is preferred because the older term gives rise to the assumption that the optics of the eye were the general cause for illusions (which is only the case for so-called physical illusions). \\"Optical\\" in the term derives from the Greek optein = \\"seeing\\", so the term refers to an \\"illusion of seeing\\", not to optics as a branch of modern physics. A regular scientific source for illusions are the journals Perception and i-Perception) is an illusion caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably appears to differ from reality. Illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult because the underlying cause is often not clear but a classification proposed by Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation. According to that, there are three main classes: physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions. A classical example for a physical distortion would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in water; an example for a physiological paradox is the motion aftereffect (where, despite movement, position remains unchanged). An example for a physiological fiction is an afterimage. Three typical cognitive distortions are the Ponzo, Poggendorff, and M√ºller-Lyer illusion. Physical illusions are caused by the physical environment, e.g. by the optical properties of water. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or the visual pathway, e.g. from the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific receptor type. Cognitive visual illusions are the result of unconscious inferences and are perhaps those most widely known. Pathological visual illusions arise from pathological changes in the physiological visual perception mechanisms causing the aforementioned types of illusions; they are discussed e.g. under visual hallucinations. Optical illusions, as well as multi-sensory illusions involving visual perception, can also be used in the monitoring and rehabilitation of some psychological disorders, including phantom limb syndromeDeCastro, Thiago Gomes; Gomes, William Barbosa (2017-05-25). \\"Rubber Hand Illusion: Evidence for a multisensory integration of proprioception\\".

Physical visual illusions  A familiar phenomenon and example for a physical visual illusion is when mountains appear to be much nearer in clear weather with low humidity (Foehn) than they are. This is because haze is a cue for depth perception, signalling the distance of far- away objects (Aerial perspective). The classical example of a physical illusion is when a stick that is half immersed in water appears bent. This phenomenon has already been discussed by Ptolemy (ca. 150) and was often a prototypical example for an illusion.  Physiological visual illusions  Physiological illusions, such as the afterimages following bright lights, or adapting stimuli of excessively longer alternating patterns (contingent perceptual aftereffect), are presumed to be the effects on the eyes or brain of excessive stimulation or interaction with contextual or competing stimuli of a specific type‚Äîbrightness, color, position, tile, size, movement, etc. The theory is that a stimulus follows its individual dedicated neural path in the early stages of visual processing and that intense or repetitive activity in that or interaction with active adjoining channels causes a physiological imbalance that alters perception. The Hermann grid illusion and Mach bands are two illusions that are often explained using a biological approach. Lateral inhibition, where in receptive fields of the retina receptor signals from light and dark areas compete with one another, has been used to explain why we see bands of increased brightness at the edge of a color difference when viewing Mach bands. Once a receptor is active, it inhibits adjacent receptors. This inhibition creates contrast, highlighting edges. In the Hermann grid illusion, the gray spots that appear at the intersections at peripheral locations are often explained to occur because of lateral inhibition by the surround in larger receptive fields.Pinel, J. (2005) Biopsychology (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn & Bacon. However, lateral inhibition as an explanation of the Hermann grid illusion has been disproved. More recent empirical approaches to optical illusions have had some success in explaining optical phenomena with which theories based on lateral inhibition have struggled.  Cognitive illusions  \\"The Organ Player\\" ‚Äì Pareidolia phenomenon in Neptune's Grotto stalactite cave (Alghero, Sardinia) Cognitive illusions are assumed to arise by interaction with assumptions about the world, leading to \\"unconscious inferences\\", an idea first suggested in the 19th century by the German physicist and physician Hermann Helmholtz. Cognitive illusions are commonly divided into ambiguous illusions, distorting illusions, paradox illusions, or fiction illusions. * Ambiguous illusions are pictures or objects that elicit a perceptual \\"switch\\" between the alternative interpretations. The Necker cube is a well-known example; other instances are the Rubin vase and the \\"squircle\\", based on Kokichi Sugihara's ambiguous cylinder illusion. * Distorting or geometrical-optical illusions are characterized by distortions of size, length, position or curvature. A striking example is the Caf√© wall illusion. Other examples are the famous M√ºller-Lyer illusion and Ponzo illusion. * Paradox illusions (or impossible object illusions) are generated by objects that are paradoxical or impossible, such as the Penrose triangle or impossible staircase seen, for example, in M. C. Escher's Ascending and Descending and Waterfall. The triangle is an illusion dependent on a cognitive misunderstanding that adjacent edges must join. * Fictions are when a figure is perceived even though it is not in the stimulus.  Explanation of cognitive illusions  = Perceptual organization = figure-ground illusion Rabbit‚Äìduck illusion To make sense of the world it is necessary to organize incoming sensations into information which is meaningful. Gestalt psychologists believe one way this is done is by perceiving individual sensory stimuli as a meaningful whole. Gestalt organization can be used to explain many illusions including the rabbit‚Äìduck illusion where the image as a whole switches back and forth from being a duck then being a rabbit and why in the figure‚Äìground illusion the figure and ground are reversible. Kanizsa's triangle In addition, gestalt theory can be used to explain the illusory contours in the Kanizsa's triangle. A floating white triangle, which does not exist, is seen. The brain has a need to see familiar simple objects and has a tendency to create a \\"whole\\" image from individual elements.Myers, D. (2003). Psychology in Modules, (7th ed.) New York: Worth. Gestalt means \\"form\\" or \\"shape\\" in German. However, another explanation of the Kanizsa's triangle is based in evolutionary psychology and the fact that in order to survive it was important to see form and edges. The use of perceptual organization to create meaning out of stimuli is the principle behind other well-known illusions including impossible objects. The brain makes sense of shapes and symbols putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle, formulating that which is not there to that which is believable. The gestalt principles of perception govern the way different objects are grouped. Good form is where the perceptual system tries to fill in the blanks in order to see simple objects rather than complex objects. Continuity is where the perceptual system tries to disambiguate which segments fit together into continuous lines. Proximity is where objects that are close together are associated. Similarity is where objects that are similar are seen as associated. Some of these elements have been successfully incorporated into quantitative models involving optimal estimation or Bayesian inference. Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2008), J. Visual Comm. Image Representation, 19(1):42-55, First-order modeling and stability analysis of illusory contours.Yoon Mo Jung and Jackie (Jianhong) Shen (2014), arXiv:1406.1265, Illusory shapes via phase transition . The double-anchoring theory, a popular but recent theory of lightness illusions, states that any region belongs to one or more frameworks, created by gestalt grouping principles, and within each frame is independently anchored to both the highest luminance and the surround luminance. A spot's lightness is determined by the average of the values computed in each framework. = Depth and motion perception = The vertical‚Äìhorizontal illusion where the vertical line is thought to be longer than the horizontal Ponzo illusion Illusions can be based on an individual's ability to see in three dimensions even though the image hitting the retina is only two dimensional. The Ponzo illusion is an example of an illusion which uses monocular cues of depth perception to fool the eye. But even with two- dimensional images, the brain exaggerates vertical distances when compared with horizontal distances, as in the vertical-horizontal illusion where the two lines are exactly the same length. In the Ponzo illusion the converging parallel lines tell the brain that the image higher in the visual field is farther away, therefore, the brain perceives the image to be larger, although the two images hitting the retina are the same size. The optical illusion seen in a diorama/false perspective also exploits assumptions based on monocular cues of depth perception. The M.C. Escher painting Waterfall exploits rules of depth and proximity and our understanding of the physical world to create an illusion. Like depth perception, motion perception is responsible for a number of sensory illusions. Film animation is based on the illusion that the brain perceives a series of slightly varied images produced in rapid succession as a moving picture. Likewise, when we are moving, as we would be while riding in a vehicle, stable surrounding objects may appear to move. We may also perceive a large object, like an airplane, to move more slowly than smaller objects, like a car, although the larger object is actually moving faster. The phi phenomenon is yet another example of how the brain perceives motion, which is most often created by blinking lights in close succession. The ambiguity of direction of motion due to lack of visual references for depth is shown in the spinning dancer illusion. The spinning dancer appears to be moving clockwise or counterclockwise depending on spontaneous activity in the brain where perception is subjective. Recent studies show on the fMRI that there are spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity while watching this illusion, particularly the parietal lobe because it is involved in perceiving movement.Bernal, B., Guillen, M., & Marquez, J. (2014). The spinning dancer illusion and spontaneous brain fluctuations: An fMRI study. Neurocase (Psychology Press), 20(6), 627-639. = Color and brightness constancies = Simultaneous contrast illusion. The background is a color gradient and progresses from dark gray to light gray. The horizontal bar appears to progress from light grey to dark grey, but is in fact just one color. Perceptual constancies are sources of illusions. Color constancy and brightness constancy are responsible for the fact that a familiar object will appear the same color regardless of the amount of light or color of light reflecting from it. An illusion of color difference or luminosity difference can be created when the luminosity or color of the area surrounding an unfamiliar object is changed. The luminosity of the object will appear brighter against a black field (that reflects less light) compared to a white field, even though the object itself did not change in luminosity. Similarly, the eye will compensate for color contrast depending on the color cast of the surrounding area. In addition to the gestalt principles of perception, water- color illusions contribute to the formation of optical illusions. Water-color illusions consist of object-hole effects and coloration. Object-hole effects occur when boundaries are prominent where there is a figure and background with a hole that is 3D volumetric in appearance. Coloration consists of an assimilation of color radiating from a thin-colored edge lining a darker chromatic contour. The water-color illusion describes how the human mind perceives the wholeness of an object such as top-down processing. Thus, contextual factors play into perceiving the brightness of an object. = Object = \\"Shepard's tables\\" deconstructed. The two tabletops appear to be different, but they are the same size and shape. Just as it perceives color and brightness constancies, the brain has the ability to understand familiar objects as having a consistent shape or size. For example, a door is perceived as a rectangle regardless of how the image may change on the retina as the door is opened and closed. Unfamiliar objects, however, do not always follow the rules of shape constancy and may change when the perspective is changed. The \\"Shepard's table\\" illusion is an example of an illusion based on distortions in shape constancy. = Future perception = Optical illusion (black and white contrast) by alt= Researcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has a more imaginative take on optical illusions, saying that they are due to a neural lag which most humans experience while awake. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Scientists have known of the lag, yet they have debated how humans compensate, with some proposing that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay. Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd.Key to All-Optical Illusions Discovered , Jeanna Bryner, Senior Writer, LiveScience.com 6/2/08. His research on this topic is detailed in the May/June 2008 issue of the journal Cognitive Science. In an interview with ABC Changizi said, \\"Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future, and those perceptions don't match reality.\\" For example, an illusion called the Hering illusion looks like bicycle spokes around a central point, with vertical lines on either side of this central, so-called vanishing point. The illusion tricks us into thinking we are looking at a perspective picture, and thus according to Changizi, switches on our future-seeing abilities. Since we aren't actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved ones. Changizi said: > Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us > premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing > point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are > moving forward‚Äîas we would in the real world, where the door frame (a pair > of vertical lines) seems to bow out as we move through it‚Äîand we try to > perceive what that world will look like in the next instant.  Pathological visual illusions (distortions)  A pathological visual illusion is a distortion of a real external stimulus and are often diffuse and persistent. Pathological visual illusions usually occur throughout the visual field, suggesting global excitability or sensitivity alterations. Alternatively visual hallucination is the perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists. Visual hallucinations are often from focal dysfunction and are usually transient. Types of visual illusions include oscillopsia, halos around objects, illusory palinopsia (visual trailing, light streaking, prolonged indistinct afterimages), akinetopsia, visual snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, pelopsia, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, metamorphopsia, dyschromatopsia, intense glare, blue field entoptic phenomenon, and purkinje trees. These symptoms may indicate an underlying disease state and necessitate seeing a medical practitioner. Etiologies associated with pathological visual illusions include multiple types of ocular disease, migraines, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, head trauma, and prescription drugs. If a medical work-up does not reveal a cause of the pathological visual illusions, the idiopathic visual disturbances could be analogous to the altered excitability state seen in visual aura with no migraine headache. If the visual illusions are diffuse and persistent, they often affect the patient's quality of life. These symptoms are often refractory to treatment and may be caused by any of the aforementioned etiologies, but are often idiopathic. There is no standard treatment for these visual disturbances.  Connections to psychological disorders  = The rubber hand illusion (RHI) = A visual representation of what an amputee with phantom limb syndrome senses. The rubber hand illusion (RHI), a multi-sensory illusion involving both visual perception and touch, has been used to study how phantom limb syndrome affects amputees over time.DeCastro, Thiago Gomes; Gomes, William Barbosa (2017-05-25). \\"Rubber Hand Illusion: Evidence for a multisensory integration of proprioception\\". Avances en Psicolog√≠a Latinoamericana. 35 (2): 219. doi:10.12804/revistas.urosario.edu.co/apl/a.3430. ISSN 2145-4515. Amputees with the syndrome actually responded to RHI more strongly than controls, an effect that was often consistent for both the sides of the intact and the amputated arm. However, in some studies, amputees actually had stronger responses to RHI on their intact arm, and more recent amputees responded to the illusion better than amputees who had been missing an arm for years or more. Researchers believe this is a sign that the body schema, or an individual's sense of their own body and its parts, progressively adapts to the post-amputation state. Essentially, the amputees were learning to longer respond to sensations near what had once been their arm. As a result, many have suggested the use of RHI as a tool for monitoring an amputee's progress in reducing their phantom limb sensations and adjusting to the new state of their body. Other research used RHI in the rehabilitation of amputees with prosthetic limbs.Christ, Oliver; Reiner, Miriam (2014-07-01). \\"Perspectives and possible applications of the rubber hand and virtual hand illusion in non- invasive rehabilitation: Technological improvements and their consequences\\". Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews. Applied Neuroscience: Models, methods, theories, reviews. A Society of Applied Neuroscience (SAN) special issue. 44: 33‚Äì44. doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.02.013. ISSN 0149-7634 After prolonged exposure to RHI, the amputees gradually stopped feeling a dissociation between the prosthetic (which resembled the rubber hand) and the rest of their body. This was thought to be because they adjusted to responding to and moving a limb that did not feel as connected to the rest of their body or senses. RHI may also be used to diagnose certain disorders related to impaired proprioception or impaired sense of touch in non-amputees. = Illusions and schizophrenia = Top-down processing involves using action plans to make perceptual interpretations and vice versa. (This is impaired in schizophrenia.) Schizophrenia, a mental disorder often marked by hallucinations, also decreases a person's ability to perceive high-order optical illusions.King, Daniel J.; Hodgekins, Joanne; Chouinard, Philippe A.; Chouinard, Virginie-Anne; Sperandio, Irene (2017-06-01). \\"A review of abnormalities in the perception of visual illusions in schizophrenia\\". Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. 24 (3): 734‚Äì751. doi:10.3758/s13423-016-1168-5. ISSN 1531-5320. This is because schizophrenia impairs one's capacity to perform top-down processing and a higher-level integration of visual information beyond the primary visual cortex, V1. Understanding how this specifically occurs in the brain may help in understanding how visual distortions, beyond imaginary hallucinations, affect schizophrenic patients. Additionally, evaluating the differences between how schizophrenic patients and normal individuals see illusions may enable researchers to better identify where specific illusions are processed in the visual streams. hollow face illusion which makes concave masks appear to be jutting out (or convex). motion induced blindness: while fixating on the flashing dot, the stationary dots may disappear due to the brain prioritizing motion information. One study on schizophrenic patients found that they were extremely unlikely to be fooled by a three dimensional optical illusion, the hollow face illusion, unlike neurotypical volunteers. Based on fMRI data, researchers concluded that this resulted from a disconnect between their systems for bottom-up processing of visual cues and top-down interpretations of those cues in the parietal cortex. In another study on the motion-induced blindness (MIB) illusion (pictured right), schizophrenic patients continued to perceive stationary visual targets even when observing distracting motion stimuli, unlike neurotypical controls, who experienced motion induced blindness. The schizophrenic test subjects demonstrated impaired cognitive organization, meaning they were less able to coordinate their processing of motion cues and stationary image cues.  List of illusions  There are a variety of different types of optical illusions. Many are included in the following list.  In art  Artists who have worked with optical illusions include M. C. Escher, Bridget Riley, Salvador Dal√≠, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Patrick Bokanowski, Marcel Duchamp, Jasper Johns, Oscar Reutersv√§rd, Victor Vasarely and Charles Allan Gilbert. Contemporary artists who have experimented with illusions include Jonty Hurwitz, Sandro del Prete, Octavio Ocampo, Dick Termes, Shigeo Fukuda, Patrick Hughes, Istv√°n Orosz, Rob Gonsalves, Gianni A. Sarcone, Ben Heine and Akiyoshi Kitaoka. Optical illusion is also used in film by the technique of forced perspective. Op art is a style of art that uses optical illusions to create an impression of movement, or hidden images and patterns. Trompe-l'≈ìil uses realistic imagery to create the optical illusion that depicted objects exist in three dimensions.  Cognitive processes hypothesis  The hypothesis claims that visual illusions occur because the neural circuitry in our visual system evolves, by neural learning, to a system that makes very efficient interpretations of usual 3D scenes based in the emergence of simplified models in our brain that speed up the interpretation process but give rise to optical illusions in unusual situations. In this sense, the cognitive processes hypothesis can be considered a framework for an understanding of optical illusions as the signature of the empirical statistical way vision has evolved to solve the inverse problem. Research indicates that 3D vision capabilities emerge and are learned jointly with the planning of movements. That is, as depth cues are better perceived, individuals can develop more efficient patterns of movement and interaction within the 3D environment around them. After a long process of learning, an internal representation of the world emerges that is well-adjusted to the perceived data coming from closer objects. The representation of distant objects near the horizon is less \\"adequate\\". In fact, it is not only the Moon that seems larger when we perceive it near the horizon. In a photo of a distant scene, all distant objects are perceived as smaller than when we observe them directly using our vision.

With Henry Royce, he co-founded the Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his Wright Flyer broke off during a flying display in Bournemouth. He was aged 32. Early life Medals won by Rolls in ballooning and motoring events. Monmouth Museum Rolls was born in Berkeley Square, London, third son of the 1st Baron Llangattock and Lady Llangattock. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home of The Hendre, near Monmouth, Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage Preparatory School in Berkshire, he was educated at Eton College where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname \\"dirty Rolls\\". In 1894 he attended a private crammer in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a Peugeot Phaeton, and joined the Automobile Club of France. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the Locomotive Act, and became a founder member of the Automobile Club of Great Britain, with which the Association merged in 1897. Rolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a Half Blue and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth. The Times, Wednesday, 13 July 1910; pg. 12; Issue 39323The Bicycle, 15 July 1942, pG. Rolls won a half-blue because cycling was not considered a full sport. Rolls also had a collection of bicycles from solos up to four-man tandems. Rolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the steam yacht Santa Maria followed by a position at the London and North Western Railway in Crewe. However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of ¬£6,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain's first car dealerships, C. S. Rolls & Co. based in Lillie Hall, Fulham, to import and sell French Peugeot and Belgian Minerva vehicles. Partnership with Royce the Duke of York accompanied by Sir Charles Cust and Rolls' father, Lord Llangattock, at 'The Hendre', 1900 Rolls was introduced to Henry Royce by a friend at the Royal Automobile Club, Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the Midland Hotel, Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces. Bronze bust at Derby Industrial Museum The first Rolls-Royce car, the Rolls-Royce 10 hp, was unveiled at the Paris Salon in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of ¬£750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of ¬£10,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls & Co. Rolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a non-executive director. C. S.

In 1903 he won the Gordon Bennett Gold Medal for the longest single flight time. By 1907 Rolls' interest turned increasingly to flying and he tried to persuade Royce to design an aero engine. He became the second Englishman to go up in an aeroplane. Piloted by Wilbur Wright their flight on 8 October 1908 from Camp d'Auvours, eleven kilometres east of Le Mans, lasted four minutes and twenty seconds.\\"U.S Centennial of Flight Commission: Wilbur & Orville Wright: A Chronology\\".Flight Log 1908 Camp d'Auvours, Le Mans, France.Retrieved 25 July 2018 He bought one of six Wright Flyer aircraft built by Short Brothers under licence from the Wright Brothers and from early October 1909 made more than 200 flights.

His grave is just below Llangattock Manor and bears the inscription: > \\"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.\\" A statue in his memory, in which he is seen holding a biplane model, was erected in Agincourt Square, Monmouth. A further memorial to him was unveiled in 1981 in the bottom playing field of St Peter's Catholic School, Bournemouth, which was developed on the site of Hengistbury Airfield.

For a short time around 1910, he was an important exponent of Post-Impressionism in the United Kingdom. He was the brother of the painter Gwen John. Early life Born in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, John was the younger son and third of four children. His father was Edwin William John, a Welsh solicitor; his mother, Augusta Smith from a long line of Sussex master plumbers, died young when he was six, but not before inculcating a love of drawing in both Augustus and his older sister Gwen.Easton, Malcolm, and Holroyd, Michael: The Art of Augustus John, page 1. David R. Godine, 1975. At the age of seventeen he briefly attended the Tenby School of Art, then left Wales for London, studying at the Slade School of Art, University College London. He became the star pupil of drawing teacher Henry Tonks and even before his graduation he was considered the most talented draughtsman of his generation.As witness \\"The legendary Slade acclamation, 'There was a man sent from God, whose name was John'\\". Easton and Holroyd, page 2. His sister, Gwen was with him at the Slade and became an important artist in her own right.One of \\"a bevy of talented girls\\" there at the time. Easton and Holroyd, page 2. In 1897, John hit submerged rocks diving into the sea at Tenby, suffering a serious head injury; the lengthy convalescence that followed seems to have stimulated his adventurous spirit and accelerated his artistic growth.Easton and Holroyd, page 2. In 1898, he won the Slade Prize with Moses and the Brazen Serpent. John afterward studied independently in Paris where he seems to have been influenced by Puvis de Chavannes.Easton and Holroyd, page 13. W.B. Yeats (1907) The need to support Ida Nettleship (1877‚Äì1907), whom he married in 1901, led him to accept a post teaching art at the University of Liverpool. Chalk drawing of Grace Westry by Augustus John 1897 North Wales Augustus John and his student James Dickson Innes spent two years painting in the Arenig valley around 1910, especially the mountain Arenig Fawr. In 2011 this period was made the subject of a BBC documentary titled The Mountain That Had to Be Painted. Provence Some time in 1910, John fell in love with the town of Martigues, in Provence, located halfway between Arles and Marseilles, and first seen from a train en route to Italy.Easton and Holroyd, page 64. John wrote that Provence \\"had been for years the goal of my dreams\\" and Martigues was the town for which he felt the greatest affection. \\"With a feeling that I was going to find what I was seeking, an anchorage at last, I returned from Marseilles, and, changing at Pas des Lanciers, took the little railway which leads to Martigues. On arriving my premonition proved correct: there was no need to seek further.\\" The connection with Provence continued until 1928, by which time John felt the town had lost its simple charm, and he sold his home there.Easton and Holroyd, page 184. He was, throughout his life, particularly interested in the Romani people (whom he referred to as \\"Gypsies\\"), and sought them out on his frequent travels around the United Kingdom and Europe. For a time, shortly after his marriage, he and his family, which included his wife Ida, mistress Dorothy (Dorelia) McNeill, and John's children by both women, travelled in a caravan, in gypsy fashion.Easton and Holroyd, pages 12‚Äì13. Later on he became the President of the Gypsy Lore Society, a position he held from 1937 until his death in 1961. War During World War I, he was attached to the Canadian forces as a war artist and made a number of memorable portraits of Canadian infantrymen. The end result was to have been a huge mural for Lord Beaverbrook and the sketches and cartoon for this suggest that it might have become his greatest large-scale work. However, like so many of his monumental conceptions, it was never completed. As a war artist, he was allowed to keep his facial hair and therefore, he and King George V were the only Army officers in the Allied forces to have a beard, apart from pioneer sergeants and those who were allowed unshaven for medical reasons.Shone, Richard, Augustus John, page 15. Phaidon, 1979. After two months in France he was sent home in disgrace after taking part in a brawl. Lord Beaverbrook, whose intervention saved John from a court-martial, sent him back to France where he produced studies for a proposed Canadian War Memorial picture, although the only major work to result from the experience was Fraternity.Easton and Holroyd, pages 26, 162. In 2011, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge finally unveiled this mural at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. This unfinished painting, The Canadians Opposite Lens, is 12 feet high by 40 feet long.\\"Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will unveil the Canadians Opposite Lens, the latest Canadian War Museum acquisition \\", press release via Canada NewsWire, 2 July 2011. Portraits Augustus John with Tallulah Bankhead and her portrait (1929) Colonel T. E. Lawrence (1919) Although known early in the century for his drawings and etchings, the bulk of John's later work consisted of portraits. Those of his two wives and his children were regarded as among his best. He was known for the psychological insight of his portraits, many of which were considered \\"cruel\\" for the truth of the depiction. Lord Leverhulme was so upset with his portrait that he cut out the head (since only that part of the image could easily be hidden in his vault) but when the remainder of the picture was returned by error to John there was an international outcry over the desecration.James Joyce complained that John's drawings of him \\"failed to represent accurately the lower part of his face\\", and commenting on Lady Ottoline Morrell's determination to hang her portrait in her drawing-room, John observed \\"Whatever she may have lacked, it wasn't courage.\\" Easton and Holroyd, pages 186, 82. By the 1920s John was Britain's leading portrait painter. John painted many distinguished contemporaries, including T. E. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, W. B. Yeats, Aleister Crowley, Lady Gregory, Tallulah Bankhead, George Bernard Shaw, the cellist Guilhermina Suggia, the Marchesa Casati and Elizabeth Bibesco. Perhaps his most famous portrait is of his fellow-countryman, Dylan Thomas, whom he introduced to Caitlin Macnamara, his sometime lover who later became Thomas' wife. Portraits of Dylan Thomas by John are held by the National Museum Wales and the National Portrait Gallery. It was said that after the war his powers diminished as his bravura technique became sketchier.Easton and Holroyd, page 24. One critic has claimed that \\"the painterly brilliance of his early work degenerated into flashiness and bombast, and the second half of his long career added little to his achievement.\\" However, from time to time his inspiration returned, as it did on a trip to Jamaica in 1937.The Two Jamaican Girls, by Augustus John (1878‚Äì1961) The works done in Jamaica between March and May 1937 evidence a resurgence of his powers, and amounted to \\"the St. Martin's summer of his creative genius\\".Easton and Holroyd, page 194. Of his method for painting portraits John explained:Easton and Holroyd, page 156. Family The Two Jamaican Girls (ca. 1937) Augustus John poses for the American press on board a ship. Early in 1901, he married his first wife, Ida Nettleship (1877‚Äì1907); the couple had five children. After her death in 1907, his mistress Dorothy \\"Dorelia\\" McNeill, a Bohemian style icon, became his partner; they lived together most of the time from 1904 until his death and had two children, but never married. One of his sons (by his first wife) was the prominent British Admiral and First Sea Lord Sir Caspar John. His daughter Vivien John (1915‚Äì1994) was a notable painter. By Ian Fleming's widowed mother, Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming, Rose, he had a daughter, Amaryllis Fleming (1925‚Äì1999), who became a noted cellist. Another of his sons, by Mavis de Vere Cole, wife of the prankster Horace de Vere Cole, is the television director Tristan de Vere Cole. His son Romilly (1906‚Äì1986) was in the RAF, briefly a civil servant, then a poet, author and an amateur physicist. Poppet (1912‚Äì1997), John's daughter by Dorothy, married the Dutch painter Willem Jilts Pol (1905‚Äì1988). Willem Pol's daughter Talitha (1940‚Äì1971) by an earlier marriage (i.e. step-granddaughter of both Augustus and Dorothy), a fashion icon of 1960s London, married John Paul Getty Jr.. His daughter Gwyneth Johnstone (1915‚Äì2010), by musician Nora Brownsword, was an artist.Gwyneth Johnstone obituary (The Guardian, 6 January 2011). Augustus John's promiscuity gave rise to rumours that he had fathered as many as 100 children. Later life Augustus John by Reginald Gray, at Royal Academy London in 1960 (collection Mr. Derry O'Sullivan. Paris) In later life, John wrote two volumes of autobiography, Chiaroscuro (1952) and Finishing Touches (1964).Easton and Holroyd, pages 41‚Äì2. In old age, although John had ceased to be a moving force in British art, he was still greatly revered, as was demonstrated by the huge show of his work mounted by the Royal Academy in 1954. He continued to work up until his death in Fordingbridge, Hampshire in 1961, his last work being a studio mural in three parts, the left hand of which showed a Falstaffian figure of a French peasant in a yellow waistcoat playing a hurdy-gurdy while coming down a village street. It was Augustus John's final wave goodbye. He joined the Peace Pledge Union as a pacifist in the 1950s, and was a founder member of the Committee of 100. On 17 September 1961, just over a month before his death, he joined the Committee of 100's anti-nuclear weapons demonstration in Trafalgar Square, London. At the time, his son, Admiral Sir Caspar John was First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. He died at Fordingbridge, aged 83. He is said to have been the model for the bohemian painter depicted in Joyce Cary's novel The Horse's Mouth, which was later made into a 1958 film of the same name with Alec Guinness in the lead role. Michael Holroyd published a biography of John in 1975 and it is a mark of the public's continued interest in the painter that Holroyd published a new version of the biography in 1996. Honours He became a leader of the New English Art Club, where he chiefly exhibited. With his vivid manner of portraiture and his ability to catch unerringly some striking and usually unfamiliar aspect of his subject, he superseded Sargent as England's fashionable portrait painter. In 1921 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy and elected a full R.A. in 1928. He was named to the Order of Merit by King George VI in 1942. He was a trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1933 to 1941, and President of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters from 1948 to 1953. He was awarded the Freedom of the Town of Tenby on 30 October 1959.

He is associated with neo-romanticism and is known best for his 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac. Rostand's romantic plays contrasted with the naturalistic theatre popular during the late nineteenth century. Another of Rostand's works, Les Romanesques (1894), was adapted to the 1960 musical comedy The Fantasticks. Early life Rostand was born in Marseille, France, into a wealthy and cultured Proven√ßal family. His father was an economist, a poet who translated and edited the works of Catullus, and a member of the Marseille Academy and the Institut de France. Rostand studied literature, history, and philosophy at the Coll√®ge Stanislas in Paris, France. Career When Rostand was twenty years old, his first play, a one-act comedy, Le Gant rouge, was performed at the Cluny Theatre, 24 August 1888, but it was almost unnoticed.William Lyon Phelps (1921) Essays on Modern Dramatists, Macmillan, New York In 1890, Rostand published a volume of poems called Les Musardises.Annual Register for the Year 1918 (1919) Longmans, Green and Company, London ‚Äì New York The same year he offered a one-act Pierrot play in verse to the director of the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais. This gave him the opportunity to write for the state theatre a three-act play, also in verse, as are all Rostand's plays. He considered himself a poet, whether writing plays or poetry. The resulting play, Les Romanesques, was produced at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais on 21 May 1894. It was a great success and was the start of his career as a dramatist. This play would be adapted in 1960 by Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt into the long-running American musical The Fantasticks. Rostand's next play was written for Sarah Bernhardt. La Princesse Lointaine was based on the story of the 12th-century troubadour Jaufre Rudel and his love for Hodierna of Jerusalem (who is the archetypal princesse lointaine character). This idealistic play opened on 5 April 1895, at the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance. The part of M√©lissinde (based on Hodierna's daughter Melisende of Tripoli) was created by Sarah Bernhardt but the play was not particularly successful. When Berhardt performed it in London later the same year, it received a bad review from George Bernard Shaw but this was not surprising considering Shaw's bias for realism. Rambaldo di Vaqueiras: I Monferrato, 1922 1922 verse drama by Nino Berrini is based on La Princesse Lointaine. Bernhardt, undeterred, asked Rostand to write another play for her. She created the role of Photine in La Samaritaine (Theatre de la Renaissance, 14 April 1897), a Biblical drama in three scenes adapted from the gospel story of the woman of Samaria. This play was more successful and became part of Sarah Bernhardt's repertoire. Rostand felt satisfied that he had proven to the public that he was something more than a writer of comedies. Edmond Rostand, aged 29, at the time of the first performance of Cyrano, 1898 The production of his heroic comedy Cyrano de Bergerac (28 December 1897, Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin), with Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin in the title role, was a triumph. The first production lasted for more than 300 consecutive nights. No such enthusiasm for a drama in verse had been known since the time of Hugo's Hernani. The play was quickly translated into English, German, Russian and other European languages. Cyrano de Bergerac had been a boyhood hero of Rostand, who loved his idealism and courage. He had also thoroughly researched French 17th-century history. The play L'Aiglon was written for Sarah Bernhardt to perform during the Exposition Universelle in Paris. A patriotic subject was required, and Rostand chose a subject from Napoleonic history, suggested probably by Henri Welschinger's Roi de Rome, 1811‚Äì32 (1897), which contained much new information about the unhappy life of the Duke of Reichstadt, son of Napoleon I, and Marie Louise, surveilled by agents of Metternich at the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. L'Aiglon, a verse drama in six acts, was produced (15 March 1900) by Sarah Bernhardt at her own theatre, she herself performing the trouser role of the Duke of Reichstadt. In 1902, Rostand became the youngest writer ever to be elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He relocated to Cambo- les-bains, in the Basque Pyrenees, in 1903 for health reasons. Here he built himself a villa, Arnaga (now a Rostand museum) and worked on his next play, one for Constant Coquelin this time. Chantecler. Produced in February 1910, it was awaited with an interest, enhanced by considerable delay in the production, which affected the enthusiasm of its reception. Nor did the Parisian audience enjoy the caricature of salon life in the third act. Since Constant Coquelin had died during rehearsals, Lucien Guitry was in the title role and Mme. Simone played the part of the pheasant. Chantecler is a cockerel and the characters are birds and animals. \\"Chantecler\\" is the great play of Rostand's maturity, expressing Rostand's own deepest feelings as a poet and idealist. When he died prematurely at fifty years old, Rostand was still writing plays. \\"La Derni√®re Nuit de Don Juan\\" was performed posthumously in 1922. There were two unfinished and unpublished plays ‚Äì Yorick and Les Petites Manies.Contemporary Authors Online (2003) Gale, Detroit Personal life Guth in 1901 Rostand was married to the poet and playwright Rosemonde-√âtienette G√©rard who, in 1890, published Les Pipeaux: a volume of verse commended by the Academy. The couple had two sons, Jean and Maurice. During the 1900s, Rostand came to live in the Villa Arnaga in Cambo-les-Bains in the French Basque Country, seeking a cure for his pleurisy. The house is now a heritage site and a museum of Rostand's life and Basque architecture and crafts. Rostand died in 1918, a victim of the flu pandemic, and is buried in the Cimeti√®re de Marseille.

A typical example of a group object is a topological group, a group whose underlying set is a topological space such that the group operations are continuous. Definition Formally, we start with a category C with finite products (i.e. C has a terminal object 1 and any two objects of C have a product). A group object in C is an object G of C together with morphisms *m : G √ó G ‚Üí G (thought of as the \\"group multiplication\\") *e : 1 ‚Üí G (thought of as the \\"inclusion of the identity element\\") *inv : G ‚Üí G (thought of as the \\"inversion operation\\") such that the following properties (modeled on the group axioms ‚Äì more precisely, on the definition of a group used in universal algebra) are satisfied * m is associative, i.e. m (m √ó idG) = m (idG √ó m) as morphisms G √ó G √ó G ‚Üí G, and where e.g. m √ó idG : G √ó G √ó G ‚Üí G √ó G; here we identify G √ó (G √ó G) in a canonical manner with (G √ó G) √ó G. * e is a two- sided unit of m, i.e. m (idG √ó e) = p1, where p1 : G √ó 1 ‚Üí G is the canonical projection, and m (e √ó idG) = p2, where p2 : 1 √ó G ‚Üí G is the canonical projection * inv is a two-sided inverse for m, i.e. if d : G ‚Üí G √ó G is the diagonal map, and eG : G ‚Üí G is the composition of the unique morphism G ‚Üí 1 (also called the counit) with e, then m (idG √ó inv) d = eG and m (inv √ó idG) d = eG. Note that this is stated in terms of maps ‚Äì product and inverse must be maps in the category ‚Äì and without any reference to underlying \\"elements\\" of the group object ‚Äì categories in general do not have elements of their objects. Another way to state the above is to say G is a group object in a category C if for every object X in C, there is a group structure on the morphisms Hom(X, G) from X to G such that the association of X to Hom(X, G) is a (contravariant) functor from C to the category of groups.  Examples  * Each set G for which a group structure (G, m, u, ‚àí1) can be defined can be considered a group object in the category of sets. The map m is the group operation, the map e (whose domain is a singleton) picks out the identity element u of G, and the map inv assigns to every group element its inverse. eG : G ‚Üí G is the map that sends every element of G to the identity element. * A topological group is a group object in the category of topological spaces with continuous functions. * A Lie group is a group object in the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps. * A Lie supergroup is a group object in the category of supermanifolds. * An algebraic group is a group object in the category of algebraic varieties. In modern algebraic geometry, one considers the more general group schemes, group objects in the category of schemes. * A localic group is a group object in the category of locales. * The group objects in the category of groups (or monoids) are the abelian groups. The reason for this is that, if inv is assumed to be a homomorphism, then G must be abelian. More precisely: if A is an abelian group and we denote by m the group multiplication of A, by e the inclusion of the identity element, and by inv the inversion operation on A, then (A, m, e, inv) is a group object in the category of groups (or monoids). Conversely, if (A, m, e, inv) is a group object in one of those categories, then m necessarily coincides with the given operation on A, e is the inclusion of the given identity element on A, inv is the inversion operation and A with the given operation is an abelian group. See also Eckmann‚ÄìHilton argument. * The strict 2-group is the group object in the category of small categories. * Given a category C with finite coproducts, a cogroup object is an object G of C together with a \\"comultiplication\\" m: G ‚Üí G \\\\oplus G, a \\"coidentity\\" e: G ‚Üí 0, and a \\"coinversion\\" inv: G ‚Üí G that satisfy the dual versions of the axioms for group objects. Here 0 is the initial object of C. Cogroup objects occur naturally in algebraic topology. Group theory generalized Much of group theory can be formulated in the context of the more general group objects. The notions of group homomorphism, subgroup, normal subgroup and the isomorphism theorems are typical examples. However, results of group theory that talk about individual elements, or the order of specific elements or subgroups, normally cannot be generalized to group objects in a straightforward manner.

It was released on 6 August 2001 in the UK, and reached #6 on the UK album chart. Background The album only had one single taken from it, \\"Stone by Stone\\" ‚Äì the group's final single release. Fittingly, the ending of the video for the song features the band members all abandoning their instruments and walking away. The band had announced on their website that the next single was to be the rocky \\"Is Everybody Here On Drugs\\", although the announcement was quickly removed once it was clear that Catatonia were about to put an end to the band. The band were unable to promote the album, albeit with the exception of an appearance on Later...with Jools Holland and a few performances of \\"Stone by Stone\\", as Cerys Matthews was being treated for alcohol addiction and nervous exhaustion. The band had to cancel their upcoming eight venue UK tour which was due to take place during September due to ongoing concerns with Matthews' recovery. A statement by the record label Warners said that Matthews would not have \\"recovered sufficiently\\" from her treatment for \\"anxiety and exhaustion.\\" The album's cover and in-sleeve photos were taken from the film, Tiger Bay, which starred Hayley Mills. Hayley was given a thank-you in the album. The album was dedicated to close friend and roadie Barry Cawley, who was killed in a road accident on his bicycle in Betws-y-Coed, North Wales in July 2000. The track, \\"Imaginary Friend\\", was written about him. The album title refers to the game rock paper scissors. Reception Andy Gill of The Independent noted a feeling within some of the album's lyrics and song titles such as \\"Is Everybody Here on Drugs?\\", which felt like they mirrored her actual life. Gill commented: \\"Cerys's boozing is, on this showing, the least of the band's problems. More pressing, surely, is the glaring absence of a hook as memorable as 'Road Rage' or 'Mulder & Scully'; the closest they come here is the single 'Stone by Stone'.\\" Caroline Sullivan in The Guardian said that \\"[Matthews] will always be an acquired taste, one that depends wholly on the strength of the songs. Ideally suited to pub singalongs, her warble is done justice by festival anthems such as Road Rage, but when pitted against anything heavy or balladish it tends to grate relentlessly.\\" She also praised the single \\"Stone by Stone\\", saying it \\"gets it right.\\" She concluded: \\"on balance it comes down to loving or hating that voice.\\" In 2006, Iain Forrester of Stylus Magazine said the album \\"certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve any of the hatred it received in the press at the time. It has a fire to match their debut and a much wider musical scope, taking in the string-laden melodrama of 'Godspeed' (which certainly suits Cerys Matthews‚Äô bellowing vocals) and flirtations with dance on 'What It Is,' as well as rock blasts like 'Immediate Circle'.\\" Track listing Personnel * Cerys Matthews ‚Äì vocals * Mark Roberts ‚Äì guitar * Owen Powell ‚Äì guitar * Paul Jones ‚Äì bass * Aled Richards ‚Äì drums References 2001 albums Catatonia (band) albums Albums produced by Alan Winstanley Albums produced by Clive Langer Blanco y Negro Records albums Albums recorded at Rockfield Studios ","title":"Paper Scissors Stone (album)"},{"id":"53514","text":"Edith Louisa Cavell (; 4 December 1865 ‚Äì 12 October 1915) was a British nurse. She is celebrated for saving the lives of soldiers from both sides without discrimination and in helping some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German- occupied Belgium during the First World War, for which she was arrested. She was accused of treason, found guilty by a court-martial and sentenced to death. Despite international pressure for mercy, she was shot by a German firing squad. Her execution received worldwide condemnation and extensive press coverage. The night before her execution, she said, \\"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\\" These words were later inscribed on a memorial to her near Trafalgar Square. Her strong Anglican beliefs propelled her to help all those who needed it, both German and Allied soldiers. She was quoted as saying, \\"I can‚Äôt stop while there are lives to be saved.\\" The Church of England commemorates her in its Calendar of Saints on 12 October. Cavell, who was 49 at the time of her execution, was already notable as a pioneer of modern nursing in Belgium.  Early life and career  Cavell in a garden in Brussels with her two dogs before the outbreak of war Cavell (seated centre) with a group of multinational student nurses whom she trained in Brussels Cavell was born on 4 December 1865 in Swardeston, a village near Norwich, where her father was vicar for 45 years. She was the eldest of the four children of the Reverend Frederick Cavell (1824‚Äì1910) and his wife Louisa Sophia Warming (1835‚Äì1918). Edith's siblings were Florence Mary (b. 1867), Mary Lilian (b. 1870) and John Frederick S. (1872‚Äì1923). She was educated at Norwich High School for Girls, then boarding schools in Clevedon, Somerset and Peterborough (Laurel Court). After a period as a governess, including for a family in Brussels from 1890 to 1895, she returned home to care for her father during a serious illness. The experience led her to become a nurse after her father's recovery. In April 1896, at the age of 30, Cavell applied to become a nurse probationer at the London Hospital under Matron Eva Luckes. She worked in various hospitals in England, including Shoreditch Infirmary (since renamed St Leonard's Hospital). As a private travelling nurse, treating patients in their homes, Cavell travelled to tend patients with cancer, gout, pneumonia, pleurisy, eye issues and appendicitis. Cavell was sent to assist with the typhoid outbreak in Maidstone during 1897. Along with other staff she was awarded the Maidstone Medal. In 1906 she took a temporary post as matron of the Manchester and Salford Sick and Poor and Private Nursing Institution and worked there for about nine months. While there she worshipped at Sacred Trinity Church on Chapel Street, Salford and her name is included on the church war memorial. On the centenary of her execution, an event funded by the University of Salford took place at Sacred Trinity where historian Sir Ian Kershaw and Christine Hallett of the UK Centre for the History of Nursing and Midwifery, spoke. In 1907, Cavell was recruited by Dr Antoine Depage to be matron of a newly established nursing school, L'√âcole Belge d'Infirmi√®res Dipl√¥m√©es (or the Berkendael Medical Institute) on the Rue de la Culture (now Rue Franz Merjay), in Ixelles, Brussels. By 1910, \\"Miss Cavell 'felt that the profession of nursing had gained sufficient foothold in Belgium to warrant the publishing of a professional journal' and, therefore, launched the nursing journal, L'infirmi√®re\\". Within a year, she was training nurses for three hospitals, twenty-four schools, and thirteen kindergartens in Belgium. When the First World War broke out, she was visiting her widowed mother in Norfolk. She returned to Brussels, where her clinic and nursing school were taken over by the Red Cross.  Return to Brussels  Cavell had been offered a position as matron in a Brussels clinic. She worked closely with Dr Depage who was part of a \\"growing body of people\\" in the medical profession in Belgium. He realised that the care that was being provided by the religious institutions had not been keeping up with medical advances. In 1910, Cavell was asked if she would be the matron for the new secular hospital at Saint-Gilles.  First World War and execution  In November 1914, after the German occupation of Brussels, Cavell began sheltering British soldiers and funnelling them out of occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. Wounded British and French soldiers as well as Belgian and French civilians of military age were hidden from the Germans and provided with false papers by Prince R√©ginald de Cro√ø at his ch√¢teau of Bellignies near Mons. From there, they were conducted by various guides to the houses of Cavell, Louis S√©verin, and others in Brussels, where their hosts would furnish them with money to reach the Dutch frontier, and provide them with guides obtained through Philippe Baucq. This placed Cavell in violation of German military law. German authorities became increasingly suspicious of the nurse's actions, which were further fuelled by her outspokenness. She was arrested on 3 August 1915 and charged with harbouring Allied soldiers. She had been betrayed by Georges Gaston Quien, who was later convicted by a French court as a collaborator. She was held in Saint-Gilles prison for ten weeks, the last two of which were spent in solitary confinement. She made three depositions to the German police (on 8, 18 and 22 August), admitting that she had been instrumental in conveying about 60 British and 15 French soldiers, as well as about 100 French and Belgian civilians of military age, to the frontier and had sheltered most of them in her house. At her court-martial, she was prosecuted for aiding British and French soldiers, in addition to young Belgian men, to cross the Dutch border and eventually enter Britain. She admitted her guilt when she signed a statement the day before the trial. Cavell declared that the soldiers she had helped escape thanked her in writing when they arrived safely in Britain. This admission confirmed that Cavell had helped the soldiers navigate the Dutch frontier, but it also established that she helped them escape to a country at war with Germany. Her fellow defendants included Prince Reginald's sister, Princess Marie of Cro√ø. The penalty, according to German military law, was death. Paragraph 58 of the German Military Code determined that \\"at time of war, anyone who with the intention of aiding a hostile power, or of causing harm to the German or allied troops\\" commits any of the crimes defined in paragraph 90 of the German Penal Code \\"shall be punished with death for war treason\\". Specifically, Cavell was charged under paragraph 90 (1) no. 3 Reichsstrafgesetzbuch, for \\"conveying troops to the enemy\\", a crime normally punishable by life imprisonment in peacetime. It was possible to charge Cavell with war treason as paragraph 160 of the German Military Code extended application of paragraph 58 to foreigners \\"present in the zone of war\\". propaganda stamp issued shortly after Cavell's death While the First Geneva Convention ordinarily guaranteed protection of medical personnel, that protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action. This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention, which was the version in force at the time, and justified prosecution on the basis of German law. The British government could do nothing to help her. Sir Horace Rowland of the Foreign Office said, \\"I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell; I am afraid we are powerless.\\" Lord Robert Cecil, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised that, \\"Any representation by us will do her more harm than good.\\" The United States, however, had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure. Hugh S. Gibson, First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels, made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany's already damaged reputation. Later, he wrote: Baron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives, German as well as Allied. However, General von Sauberzweig, the military governor of Brussels, ordered that \\"in the interests of the State\\" the implementation of the death penalty against Baucq and Cavell should be immediate, denying higher authorities an opportunity to consider clemency. Cavell was defended by lawyer Sadi Kirschen from Brussels. Of the twenty-seven defendants, five were condemned to death: Cavell, Baucq (an architect in his thirties), Louise Thuliez, S√©verin and Countess Jeanne de Belleville. Of the five sentenced to death, only Cavell and Baucq were executed; the other three were granted reprieve. Cavell was arrested not for espionage, as many were led to believe, but for \\"war treason\\", despite not being a German national. She may have been recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), and turned away from her espionage duties in order to help Allied soldiers escape, although this is not widely accepted. Rankin cites the published statement of M. R. D. Foot, historian and Second World War British intelligence officer, as to Cavell having been part of SIS or MI6. The former director-general of MI5, Stella Rimington, announced in 2015 that she had unearthed documents in Belgian military archives that confirmed an intelligence gathering aspect to Cavell's network. The BBC Radio 4 programme that presented Rimington's quote, noted Cavell's use of secret codes and, though amateurish, other network members' successful transmission of intelligence. When in custody, Cavell was questioned in French, but her trial was minuted in German; which some assert gave the prosecutor the opportunity to misinterpret her answers. Although she may have been misrepresented, she made no attempt to defend herself, but responded to have channelled \\"environ deux cents\\" soldiers to the Dutch border. Cavell was provided with a defender approved by the German military governor; a previous defender, who was chosen for Cavell by her assistant, Elizabeth Wilkins, was ultimately rejected by the governor. George Bellows, The Murder of Edith Cavell, 1918, Princeton University Art Museum The night before her execution, she told the Reverend H Stirling Gahan, the Anglican chaplain of Christ Church Brussels and former member of staff at Monkton Combe School who had been allowed to see her and to give her Holy Communion, \\"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.\\" These words are inscribed on her statue on St Martin's Place (A400), northeast of Trafalgar Square in London. Her final words to the German Lutheran prison chaplain, Paul Le Seur, were recorded as, \\"Ask Father Gahan to tell my loved ones later on that my soul, as I believe, is safe, and that I am glad to die for my country.\\" From his sick bed Brand Whitlock, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, wrote a personal note on Cavell's behalf to Moritz von Bissing, the Governor-General of Belgium. Hugh Gibson; Maitre G. de Leval, the legal adviser to the United States legation; and , 2nd Marques de Villalobar, the Spanish minister, formed a midnight deputation of appeal for mercy or at least postponement of execution. Despite these efforts, on 11 October, Baron von der Lancken allowed the execution to proceed. Sixteen men, forming two firing squads, carried out the sentence pronounced on her and on four Belgian men at the Tir national shooting range in Schaerbeek, at 7:00am on 12 October 1915. There are conflicting reports of the details of Cavell's execution. However, according to the eyewitness account of the Reverend Le Seur, who attended Cavell in her final hours, eight soldiers fired at Cavell while the other eight executed Baucq. Her execution, certification of death, and burial were all witnessed by the German poet Gottfried Benn in his capacity as a 'Senior Doctor in the Brussels Government since the first days of the (German) occupation'. Benn wrote a detailed account titled \\"Wie Miss Cavell erschossen wurde\\" (How Miss Cavell was shot, 1928). There is also a dispute over the sentencing imposed under the German Military Code. Supposedly, the death penalty relevant to the offence committed by Cavell was not officially declared until a few hours after her death. The British post-war Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws of War however regarded the verdict as legally correct. On instructions from the Spanish minister, Belgian women immediately buried her body next to Saint-Gilles Prison. After the war, her body was taken back to Britain for a memorial service at Westminster Abbey and then transferred to Norwich, to be laid to rest at Life's Green on the east side of the cathedral. The King had to grant an exception to an Order in Council of 1854, which prevented any burials in the grounds of the cathedral, to allow the reburial.  First World War propaganda  An anti-German post- First World War poster from the British Empire Union, including Cavell's grave The Cavell Case (1919), an American film Edith Cavell (Uccle 2015), by Nathalie Lambert In the months and years following Cavell's death, countless newspaper articles, pamphlets, images, and books publicised her story. She became an iconic propaganda figure for military recruitment in Britain, and to help increase favourable sentiment towards the Allies in the United States. She was a popular icon because of her sex, her nursing profession, and her apparently heroic approach to death. Her execution was represented as an act of German barbarism and moral depravity. News reports shortly following Cavell's execution were found to be only true in part. Even the American Journal of Nursing repeated the fictional account of Cavell's execution in which she fainted and fell because of her refusal to wear a blindfold in front of the firing squad. Allegedly, while she lay unconscious, the German commanding officer shot her dead with a revolver. Along with the invasion of Belgium, and the sinking of the Lusitania, Cavell's execution was widely publicised in both Britain and North America by Wellington House, the British War Propaganda Bureau. Because of the British government's decision to publicise Cavell's story as part of its propaganda effort, she became the most prominent British female casualty of the First World War. The combination of heroic appeal and a resonant atrocity-story narrative made Cavell's case one of the most effective in British propaganda of the First World War. Before the First World War, Cavell was not well known outside nursing circles. This allowed two different depictions of the truth about her in British propaganda, which were a reply to enemy attempts to justify her shooting, including the suggestion that Cavell, during her interrogation, had given information that incriminated others. In November 1915, the British Foreign Office issued a denial that Cavell had implicated anyone else in her testimony. One image commonly represented was of Cavell as an innocent victim of a ruthless and dishonourable enemy. This view depicted her as having helped Allied soldiers to escape, but innocent of 'espionage', and was most commonly used in various forms of British propaganda, such as postcards and newspaper illustrations during the war. Her story was presented in the British press as a means of fuelling a desire for revenge on the battlefield. These images implied that men must enlist in the armed forces immediately in order to stop forces that could arrange the judicial murder of an innocent British woman. Another representation of a side of Cavell during the First World War saw her described as a serious, reserved, brave, and patriotic woman who devoted her life to nursing and died to save others. This portrayal has been illustrated in numerous biographical sources, from personal first-hand experiences of the Red Cross nurse. Pastor Le Seur, the German army chaplain, recalled at the time of her execution, \\"I do not believe that Miss Cavell wanted to be a martyr... but she was ready to die for her country... Miss Cavell was a very brave woman and a faithful Christian\\". Another account from Anglican chaplain, the Reverend Gahan, remembers Cavell's words, \\"I have no fear or shrinking; I have seen death so often it is not strange, or fearful to me!\\" In this interpretation, her stoicism was seen as remarkable for a non-combatant woman, and brought her even greater renown than a man in similar circumstances would have received.  German response  The Imperial German Government thought that it had acted fairly towards Cavell. In a letter, German Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Dr Alfred Zimmermann (not to be confused with Arthur Zimmermann, German Secretary for Foreign Affairs) made a statement to the press on behalf of the German government: From the perspective of the German government, had it released Cavell there might have been a surge in the number of women participating in acts against Germany because they knew they would not be severely punished. It took the view that it was up to the responsible men to follow their legal duty to Germany and ignore the world's condemnation. Its laws did not make distinctions between sexes; the only exception to this being that, according to legal customs, women in a \\"delicate\\" (probably this means \\"pregnant\\") condition should not be executed. However, in January 1916, the Kaiser decreed that, from then on, capital punishment should not be carried out on women without his explicit prior endorsement. The German government also believed that all of the convicted people were thoroughly aware of the nature of their acts. The court paid particular attention to this point, releasing several people because there was doubt as to whether the accused knew that their actions were punishable. The condemned, in contrast, knew full well what they were doing and the punishment for committing their crimes because \\"numerous public proclamations had pointed out the fact that aiding enemies‚Äô armies was punishable with death.\\" The Allied response to this was the same as to Bethmann-Hollweg's announcement of the invasion of Belgium, or the notice given in the papers of intent to sink such ships as the : to make a public proclamation of a thing does not make it right.  Burial and memorials  Memorial to Cavell outside Norwich Cathedral XII ‚Äì Execution of Edith Cavell, one of 14 paintings on Cavell by Brian Whelan in Norwich Cathedral Detail of the Edith Cavell Memorial, St Martin's Place, London War memorial in Rue Colonel Bourg, Schaerbeek including Cavell's name Monument to Edith Cavell and Marie Depage, Brussels Interior of the Cavell Van at Bodiam railway station Cavell's remains were returned to Britain after the war. As the ship bearing the coffin arrived in Dover, a full peal of Grandsire Triples (5040 Changes, Parker's Twelve-Part) was rung on the bells of the parish church. The peal was notable: \\"Rung with the bells deeply muffled with the exception of the Tenor which was open at back stroke, in token of respect to Nurse Cavell, whose body arrived at Dover during the ringing and rested in the town till the following morning. The ringers of 1-2-3-4-5-6 are ex-soldiers, F. Elliot having been eight months Prisoner of War in Germany.\\" Deep (or full) muffling is normally only used for the deaths of sovereigns. A peal using the same method, with the bells half muffled, was rung for the centenary of her repatriation. After an overnight pause in the parish church the body was conveyed to London and a state funeral was held at Westminster Abbey. On 19 May 1919, her body was reburied at the east side of Norwich Cathedral; a graveside service is still held each October. The railway van known as the Cavell Van that conveyed her remains from Dover to London is kept as a memorial on the Kent and East Sussex Railway and is usually open to view at Bodiam railway station. In the Church of England's calendar of saints, the day appointed for the commemoration of Cavell is 12 October. This is a memorial in her honour rather than formal canonisation, and so not a \\"saint's feast day\\" in the traditional sense. Following Cavell's death, many memorials were created around the world to remember her. A patriotic song, \\"Remember Nurse Cavell\\" (words by Gordon V. Thompson, music by Jules Brazil) appeared with 1915 British copyright. The name Mount Edith Cavell was given in 1916 to a massive peak in Canada's Jasper National Park. A memorial statue was unveiled on 12 October 1918 by Queen Alexandra in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral, during the opening of a home for nurses, which also bore her name. To commemorate her centenary in 2015, work went ahead to restore Cavell's grave in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral after being awarded a ¬£50,000 grant. Fourteen paintings by Brian Whelan were commissioned by Norwich Cathedral to commemorate the life and death of Edith Cavell. During October 2015, a railway carriage (Cavell Van) used to transport Cavell's body back to the United Kingdom was on display outside the Forum, Norwich. Norwich Cathedral held a memorial service, performed live on BBC Radio 4 on 11 October 2015. In addition to cathedral clergy, guests such as General Richard Dannatt, and actress Matilda Ziegler performed various spoken vignettes organised by Canon Peter Doll. Anto Morra sang unaccompanied his \\"Edith Louisa Cavell\\" lyrics to a tune written by Percy Paradise. The centenary was marked by two new musical compositions: * Eventide: In Memoriam Edith Cavell by Patrick Hawes premiered in Norwich Cathedral in July 2014 with a premiere due to take place on the exact centenary of Cavell's death on 12 October 2015 in London. * Cavell Mass by David Mitchell, performed in Holy Trinity Pro-Cathedral, Brussels on 10 October 2015, together with Haydn's Missa in Angustiis.

Frank Baum is a children's novel, the seventh in the Oz series. Characters include the Woozy, Ojo \\"the Unlucky\\", Unc Nunkie, Dr. Pipt, Scraps (the patchwork girl), and others. The book was first published on July 1, 1913, with illustrations by John R. Neill. In 1914, Baum adapted the book to film through his \\"Oz Film Manufacturing Company.\\" In the previous Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, magic was used to isolate Oz from all contact with the outside world. Baum did this to end the Oz series, but was forced to restart the series with this book due to financial hardship. In the prologue, he reconciles Oz's isolation with the appearance of a new Oz book by explaining that he contacted Dorothy in Oz via wireless telegraphy, and she obtained Ozma's permission to tell Baum this story. The book was dedicated to Sumner Hamilton Britton, the young son of one of its publishers, Sumner Charles Britton of Reilly & Britton. Plot Ojo, known as Ojo the Unlucky, lives in poverty with his laconic uncle Unc Nunkie in the woods of the Munchkin Country in Oz. They visit their neighbor, the magician Dr. Pipt who is about to complete the six-year process of preparing the magical Powder of Life, which can bring inanimate objects to life. Pipt's wife has constructed a life-sized stuffed girl out of patchwork, and wishes her husband to animate her to serve as an obedient household servant. They also meet another of Pipt's creations, Bungle, an extremely vain talking cat made of glass. The Powder of Life successfully animates the patchwork girl, but an accident causes both Pipt's wife and Unc Nunkie to be turned to stone. Dr. Pipt tells Ojo that he must obtain five ingredients to make a compound to counteract the petrifaction spell. Ojo and the patchwork girl, who calls herself Scraps, along with Bungle, embark on a journey to obtain the magic ingredients: a six-leaved clover, the wing of a yellow butterfly, water from a dark well, a drop of oil from a live man's body, and three hairs from a Woozy's tail. Scraps exhibits a wild, carefree personality, and is prone to spontaneous recitation of nonsense poetry. After several adventures, they meet a Woozy, a blocky quadruped who agrees to let them have three hairs from its tail. But they are unable to remove the hairs, so they take the Woozy along with them. The party is captured by large animate plants, but they are rescued by the fortuitous arrival of the Shaggy Man. He leads them to the Emerald City to meet Princess Ozma, but warns Ojo that picking a six-leaved clover is forbidden by law in Oz. Along the way they meet the Scarecrow, who is quite smitten with Scraps, as she is with him. Just outside the Emerald City, Ojo sees a six-leaved clover by the road and, believing himself to be unobserved, picks it. When they arrive at the city gates, the Soldier with the Green Whiskers approaches them and announces that Ojo is under arrest. Brought to trial before Ozma, Ojo confesses and Ozma pardons him and allows him to keep the clover. Dorothy and the Scarecrow join Ojo and Scraps as they continue their search for the remaining ingredients. Along the way they meet Jack Pumpkinhead, the playful but annoying Tottenhots, and the man-eating 21-foot- tall giant Mr. Yoop, before reaching the subterranean dwellings of the Hoppers, who each have just one leg, and the neighboring Horners, who each have one horn on their head. The two groups are on the verge of war due to a misunderstanding, but Scraps reconciles them. A grateful Horner leads the group to a well in a dark radium mine, and Ojo collects a flask of water from it. The group continues to the castle of the Tin Woodsman who rules the Winkie Country, since yellow butterflies are most likely to be found in that yellow- dominated quadrant of Oz. While talking to the Tin Woodsman, Ojo notices a drop of oil about to drip from his body, and he catches it in a vial. He explains that he now has all the ingredients except one. But when he describes the last one, the Tin Woodsman is horrified at the idea of killing an innocent butterfly, and forbids them from doing so in his realm. Ojo is devastated, but the Tin Woodsman proposes that they all travel back to the Emerald City to ask Ozma's advice. Ozma tells them that Dr. Pipt has been practicing magic illegally and has therefore been deprived of his powers. But the petrified Unc Nunkie and Pipt's wife have been brought to the Emerald City and as they all watch, the Wizard of Oz restores them to life. Ojo and Unc Nunkie are given a new house to live in near the Emerald City and the Tin Woodsman calls Ojo \\"Ojo the Lucky\\". Background and analysis In reference to The Patchwork Girl of Oz, one of Baum's letters to his publisher, Sumner Britton of Reilly & Britton, offers unusual insight on Baum's manner of creating his Oz fantasies: The same correspondence (November 23‚Äì7, 1912) discusses the deleted Chapter 21 of the book, \\"The Garden of Meats.\\" The text of the chapter has not survived, but Neill's illustrations and their captions still exist. The deleted chapter dealt with a race of vegetable people comparable to the Mangaboos in Chapters 4‚Äì6 of Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz. The vegetable people grow what Baum elsewhere calls \\"meat people,\\" apparently for food; Neill's pictures show plants with the heads of human childrenBodiless human heads are rather a pre- occupation with Baum; they occur repeatedly in his fantasies, Ozma of Oz, Chapter 6 and The Tin Woodman of Oz, Chapter 18 being two examples. being watered by their growers. (This is thematically connected with the anthropophagous plants in Chapter 10 of Patchwork Girl.) Frank Reilly tactfully wrote to Baum that the material was not \\"in harmony with your other fairy stories,\\" and would generate \\"considerable adverse criticism.\\" Baum saw his point; the chapter was dropped. At least at one point in his life, Baum stated that he considered The Patchwork Girl of Oz \\"one of the two best books of my career\\", the other being The Sea Fairies. The book was a popular success, selling just over 17,000 copies‚Äîthough this was somewhat lower than the total for the previous book, The Emerald City of Oz, and marked the start of a trend in declining sales for the Oz books that would not reverse until The Tin Woodman of Oz in 1918. Adaptations Baum wrote and produced a film based on the book, titled The Patchwork Girl of Oz. It was made by Baum's studio The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, and was released in 1914. Baum also wrote a musical stage adaptation of the book, circa 1913, with composer Louis F. Gottschalk; however, this musical was never staged. Excerpts have occasionally been performed at various annual conventions of The International Wizard of Oz Club.

The film was produced by Twentieth Century Fox, and filmed entirely in North Wales and England. Early life Aylward was born in 1902, one of three children to Thomas John Aylward and Rosina Florence (n√©e Whiskin); a working-class family from Edmonton, North London.http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/l/i/Ian- Blight/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0060.html From her early teens, Gladys worked as a domestic worker (housemaid). Following a calling to go overseas as a Christian missionary, she was accepted by the China Inland Mission to study a preliminary three-month course for aspiring missionaries. Due to her lack of progress in learning the Chinese language she was not offered further training.Latham, pp4-6 On 15 October 1932, having worked for Sir Francis Younghusband, Aylward spent her life savings on a train passage to Yangcheng, Shanxi Province, China. The perilous trip took her across Siberia with the Trans-Siberian Railway. She was detained by the Russians, but managed to evade them with local help and a lift from a Japanese ship. She travelled across Japan with the help of the British Consul and took another ship to China. Work in China On her arrival in China Yangcheng, Aylward worked with an older missionary, Jeannie Lawson, to found The Inn of the Eight Happinesses, ( bƒÅf√∫ k√®zh√†n in Chinese) the name based on the eight virtues: Love, Virtue, Gentleness, Tolerance, Loyalty, Truth, Beauty and Devotion.http://www.cjvlang.com/Photos/yangcheng/smallwoman.html There, she and Mrs. Lawson not only provided hospitality for travellers, but would also share stories about Jesus, in hopes of spreading nascent Christianity. For a time she served as an assistant to the Government of the Republic of China as a \\"foot inspector\\" by touring the countryside to enforce the new law against footbinding young Chinese girls. She met with much success in a field that had produced much resistance, including sometimes violence against the inspectors. Aylward became a national of the Republic of China in 1936 and was a revered figure among the people, taking in orphans and adopting several herself, intervening in a volatile prison riot and advocating prison reform, risking her life many times to help those in need. In 1938, the region was invaded by Japanese forces and Aylward led more than 100 orphans to safety over the mountains, despite being wounded, personally caring for them (and converting many to Christianity). She did not return to Britain until 1949, at which point her life in China was thought to be in great danger from the Communists - the army was actively seeking out missionaries. Settling in Basingstoke, she gave many lectures on her work. After her mother died, Aylward sought a return to China. After rejection by the Communist government and a stay in British administered Hong Kong, she finally settled in Taiwan in 1958. There, she founded the Gladys Aylward Orphanage,IDEA - Magazine of the Evangelical Alliance Jan/Feb 2018 p.18 with photo where she worked until her death in 1970. The Inn of the Eighth Happiness A film based on her life, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, was released in 1958. It drew from the book The Small Woman, by Alan Burgess. Although she found herself a figure of international interest due to the popularity of the film, and television and media interviews, Aylward was mortified by her depiction in the film and the liberties it took. The tall (1.75m/5' 9\\"), blonde, Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman ‚ÄúHelen Lazell‚Äù was inconsistent with Aylward's small stature, dark hair and North London accent. The struggles of Aylward and her family to effect her initial trip to China were disregarded in favour of a movie plot device of an employer \\"condescending to write to 'his old friend' Jeannie Lawson.\\" Also, Aylward's dangerous, complicated travels across Russia, China and Japan were reduced to, \\"a few rude soldiers\\", after which, \\"Hollywood's train delivered her neatly to Tientsin.\\" Many characters and place names were changed, even when these names had significant meaning, such as those of her adopted children and the name of the inn, named instead for the Chinese belief in the number 8 as being auspicious. For example, in real life she was given the Chinese name (√Äi Wƒõi D√©- a Chinese approximation to 'Aylward' ‚Äì meaning 'Virtuous One'), however in the film she was given the name Jen-Ai,( pronounced- Zhen-Ai, meaning \\"true love\\").Cast Script. British Film Institute. Colonel Linnan was portrayed as half-European, a change which she found insulting to his real Chinese lineage, and she felt her reputation was damaged by the Hollywood-embellished love scenes in the film. Not only had she never kissed a man, but the film's ending portrayed her character leaving the orphans to re-join the colonel elsewhere, even though in reality she did not retire from working with orphans until she was 60 years old. Death and legacy Aylward died on 3 January 1970, just short of her 68th birthday, and is buried in a small cemetery on the campus of Christ's College in Guandu, New Taipei, Taiwan. She was known to the Chinese as (√Äi Wƒõi D√©- a Chinese approximation to 'Aylward' ‚Äì meaning 'Virtuous One'). A London secondary school, formerly known as \\"Weir Hall and Huxley\\", was renamed the Gladys Aylward School shortly after her death. There is a blue commemorative plaque on the house where Gladys lived near the school at 67 Cheddington Road, London N18. Numerous books, short stories and films have been developed about the life and work of Gladys Aylward. Notes References *Hero Tales by Dave & Neta Jackson *These Are My People by Mildred T.

He was born in Rzesz√≥w, in South-eastern Poland in 1933 and studied acting and directing at the Ludwik Solski Academy of Dramatic Arts in Krak√≥w and Russian Academy of Theatre Arts in Moscow. He debuted as a director in 1957 in Krak√≥w with Eug√®ne Ionesco's play Chairs and shortly afterwards founded a small Laboratory Theatre in 1959 in the town of Opole in Poland. During the 1960s, the company began to tour internationally and his work attracted increasing interest. As his work gained wider acclaim and recognition, Grotowski was invited to work in the United States and he left Poland in 1982. Although the company he founded in Poland closed a few years later in 1984, he continued to teach and direct productions in Europe and America. However, Grotowski became increasingly uncomfortable with the adoption and adaptation of his ideas and practices, particularly in the US. So, at what seemed to be the height of his public profile, he left America and moved to Italy where he established the Grotowski Workcenter in 1985 in Pontedera, near Pisa. At this centre he continued his theatre experimentation and practice and it was here that he continued to direct training and private theatrical events almost in secret for the last twenty years of his life. Suffering from leukemia and a heart condition, he died in 1999 at his home in Pontedera. Biography Jerzy Grotowski was 7 when World War II broke out in 1939. During the war, Grotowski, with his mother and brother, moved from Rzesz√≥w to the village of Nienad√≥wka. =Career=  Theatre of Productions  Grotowski made his directorial debut in 1958 with the production Gods of Rain which introduced Grotowski's bold approach to text, which he continued to develop throughout his career, influencing many subsequent theatre artists. Later in 1958 Grotowski moved to Opole where he was invited by the theatre critic and dramaturg Ludwik Flaszen to serve as Director of the Theatre of 13 Rows. There he began to assemble a company of actors and artistic collaborators which would help him realize his unique vision. It was also there that he began to experiment with approaches to performance training which enabled him to shape the young actors - initially allocated to his provincial theatre - into the transformational artists they eventually became. Although his methods were often contrasted to Konstantin Stanislavski, he admired Stanslavski as \\"the first great creator of a method of acting in the theatre\\" and praised him for asking \\"all the relevant questions that could be asked about theatrical technique.\\"Gary Botting, The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972), p. 5 Among the many productions for which his theatre company became famous were \\"Orpheus\\" by Jean Cocteau, \\"Shakuntala\\" based on text by Kalidasa, \\"Dziady (Forefathers' Eve)\\" by Adam Mickiewicz and \\"Akropolis\\" by Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski. This last production was the first complete realization of Grotowski's notion of 'poor theatre.' In it the company of actors (representing concentration camp prisoners) build the structure of a crematorium around the audience while acting out stories from the Bible and Greek mythology. This conceptualization had particular resonance for the audiences in Opole, as the Auschwitz concentration camp was only sixty miles away. \\"Akropolis\\" received much attention, and could be said to have launched Grotowski's career internationally due to inventive and aggressive promotion by visiting foreign scholars and theatre professionals. A film of the production was made with an introduction by Peter Brook, which constitutes one of the most accessible and concrete records of Grotowski's work. In 1964 Grotowski followed success with success when his theatre premiered \\"The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus\\" based on the Elizabethan drama by Christopher Marlowe, featuring Zbigniew Cynkutis in the title role. Foregoing the use of props altogether, Grotowski let the actors' bodies represent different objects, establishing an intimate dynamic of relation between actors and spectators by seating audience members as the guests at Faust's last supper, with the action unfolding on and around the table where they were seated. In 1965 Grotowski moved his company to Wroc≈Çaw relabeling them a \\"Teatr Laboratorium\\", in part to avoid the heavy censorship to which professional 'theatres' were subject in Poland at that time. Work had already begun on one of their most famous productions, The Constant Prince (based on Juliusz S≈Çowacki's translation of Calder√≥n's play). Debuting in 1967, this production is thought by many to be one of the greatest theatrical works of the 20th century. Ryszard Cieslak's performance in the title role is considered the apogee of Grotowski's approach to acting. In one of his final essays, Grotowski detailed how he worked individually with Cieslak for more than a year to develop the details of the actor's physical score before combining this central element of the performance with the work of other actors and the context of torture and martyrdom intrinsic to the play. His international influence spawned exciting companies still working in Wroc≈Çaw with devotees like performance poet Hedwig Gorski in the audience, there as a Fulbright scholar.https://sites.google.com/site/hedwiggorskifulbright/ The last professional production from Grotowski as a director was in 1969. Entitled \\"Apocalypsis Cum Figuris\\" it is widely admired. Again using text from the Bible, this time combined with contemporary writings from authors such as T.S. Eliot and Simone Weil, this production was cited by members of the company as an example of a group 'total act'. The development of Apocalypsis took more than three years, beginning as a staging of S≈Çowacki's Samuel Zborowski and passing through a separate stage of development as a staging of the Gospels, Ewangelie (elaborated as a completed performance though never presented to audiences) before arriving to its final form. Throughout this process, Grotowski can already be seen abandoning the conventions of traditional theatre, straining at the boundaries of what he later termed Art as presentation. Grotowski revolutionized theatre, and, along with his first apprentice Eugenio Barba, leader and founder of Odin Teatret, is considered a father of contemporary experimental theatre. Barba was instrumental in revealing Grotowski to the world outside the iron curtain. He was the editor of the seminal book, Towards a Poor Theatre (1968) which Grotowski wrote together with Ludwik Flaszen, in which it is declared that theatre should not, because it could not, compete against the overwhelming spectacle of film and should instead focus on the very root of the act of theatre: actors co- creating the event of theatre with its spectators. > Theatre - through the actor's technique, his art in which the living > organism strives for higher motives - provides an opportunity for what could > be called integration, the discarding of masks, the revealing of the real > substance: a totality of physical and mental reactions. This opportunity > must be treated in a disciplined manner, with a full awareness of the > responsibilities it involves. Here we can see the theatre's therapeutic > function for people in our present day civilization. It is true that the > actor accomplishes this act, but he can only do so through an encounter with > the spectator - intimately, visibly, not hiding behind a cameraman, wardrobe > mistress, stage designer or make-up girl - in direct confrontation with him, > and somehow \\" instead of\\" him. The actor's act - discarding half measures, > revealing, opening up, emerging from himself as opposed to closing up - is > an invitation to the spectator. This act could be compared to an act of the > most deeply rooted, genuine love between two human beings - this is just a > comparison since we can only refer to this \\"emergence from oneself\\" through > analogy. This act, paradoxical and borderline, we call a total act. In our > opinion it epitomizes the actor's deepest calling.  Debut in the west  The year 1968 marked Grotowski's debut in the West. His company performed the Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski play Akropolis/Acropolis (1964) at the Edinburgh Festival. This was a fitting vehicle for Grotowski and his Poor Theatre because his treatment of the play in Poland had already achieved wider recognition, and was published in Pamiƒôtnik Teatralny (Warsaw, 1964), Alla Ricerca del Teatro Perduto (Padova, 1965), and Tulane Drama Review (New Orleans, 1965). It marked the first time many in Britain had been exposed to \\"Poor Theatre\\". The same year his book titled Towards A Poor Theatre appeared in Danish, published by Odin Teatrets Forlag. It appeared in English the following year, published by Methuen and Co. Ltd., with an Introduction by Peter Brook, then an Associate Director at the Royal Shakespeare Company. In it he writes feelingly about Grotowski's private consulting for the Company; he/they felt Grotowski's work was unique but equally understood that its value was diminished if talked about too much, if faith were broken with the consultant. Grotowski's company made its debut in the United States under the auspices of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall of 1969. BAM built a theatre for Grotowski's company in the Washington Square Methodist Church in Greenwich Village. Three productions were presented: Akropolis, The Constant Prince and Apocalypsis Cum Figuris during a three-week run.  Paratheatrical phase  In 1973 Grotowski published Holiday,Jerzy Grotowski, \\"Holiday: The Day That Is Holy,\\" trans. Boles≈Çaw Taborski, TDR: A Journal of Performance Studies 17, no. 2 (June 1973): 113-35. which outlined a new course of investigation. He would pursue this 'Paratheatrical' phase until 1978. This phase is known as the 'Paratheatrical' phase of his career because it was an attempt to transcend the separation between performer and spectator. Grotowski attempted this through the organization of communal rites and simple interactive exchanges that went on sometimes for extended periods, attempting to provoke in poor participants a deconditioning of impulse. The most widely circulated description of one of these post-theatrical events (a \\"beehive\\") is given by Andre Gregory, Grotowski's longtime friend and the American director whose work he most strongly endorsed, in My Dinner With Andre. Various collaborators who had been important to Grotowski's work in what he termed his \\"Theatre of Productions\\" phase had difficulty following him in these explorations beyond the boundary of conventional theatre. Other, younger members of the group came to the foreground, notably Jacek Zmys≈Çowski, whom many would consider Grotowski's closest collaborator in this period. Theatre critics have often exoticized and mystified Grotowski's work on the basis of these paratheatrical experiments, suggesting that his work should be seen in the lineage of Antonin Artaud,Gary Botting, The Theatre of Protest in America (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972) pp.5-6 a suggestion Grotowski strongly resisted. Later in life, he clarified that he quickly found this direction of research limiting, having realized that unstructured work frequently elicits banalities and cultural clich√© from participants.  Theatre of Sources  In this period of his work, Grotowski traveled intensively through India, Mexico, Haiti and elsewhere, seeking to identify elements of technique in the traditional practices of various cultures that could have a precise and discernible effect on participants. Key collaborators in this phase of work include W≈Çodzimierz Staniewski, subsequently founder of Gardzienice Theatre, Jairo Cuesta and Magda Z≈Çotowska, who traveled with Grotowski on his international expeditions. His interest in ritual techniques linked to Haitian practice led Grotowski to a long-standing collaboration with Maud Robart and Jean-Claude Tiga of Saint Soleil. Always a master strategist, Grotowski made use of his international ties and the relative freedom of travel allowed him to pursue this program of cultural research in order to flee Poland following the imposition of martial law. He spent time in Haiti and in Rome, where he delivered a series of important lectures on the topic of theatre anthropology at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1982 before seeking political asylum in the United States. His dear friends Andre and Mercedes Gregory helped Grotowski to settle in the US, where he taught at Columbia University for one year while attempting to find support for a new program of research.  Objective Drama  Unable (despite the best efforts of Richard Schechner) to secure resources for his projected research in Manhattan, in 1983 Grotowski was invited by Professor Robert Cohen to the University of California, Irvine, where he began a course of work known as 'Objective Drama'. This phase of research was characterized by an investigation of the psychophysiological impact of selected songs and other performative tools derived from traditional cultures on participants, focusing specifically on relatively simple techniques that could exert a discernible and predictable impact on the doer regardless of her belief structures or culture of origin. Ritual songs and related performative elements linked to Haitian and other African diaspora traditions became an especially fruitful tool of research. During this time Grotowski continued several important collaborative relationships begun in earlier phases, with Maud Robart, Jairo Cuesta, and Pablo Jimenez taking on significant roles as performers and research leaders in the project. He also initiated a creative relationship with American Professor Keith Fowler and his student, director James Slowiak, and discovered the individual to whom he would ultimately pass responsibility for his lifelong research, Thomas Richards, son of North American director Lloyd Richards. Voicework Jerzy Grotowski was among a small group of actors and directors, including Peter Brook and Roy Hart, who sought to explore new forms of theatrical expression without employing the spoken word.Roose-Evans, J. (1989) Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook, 4th edn. London: Routledge. In the programme notes to the production of one of Grotowski's performances called Akropolis, of which the premiere was in October 1962, one of the performers stated: > The means of verbal expression have been considerably enlarged because all > means of vocal expression are used, starting from the confused babbling of > the very small child and including the most sophisticated oratorical > recitation. Inarticulate groans, animal roars, tender folksongs, liturgical > chants, dialects, declamation of poetry: everything is there. The sounds are > interwoven in a complex score which brings back fleetingly the memory of all > forms of language.Flaszen, L. (1975) 'Akropolis ‚Äì treatment of the text.' In > J. Grotowski (ed) Towards a Poor Theatre. London: Methuen. Grotowski and his group of actors became known in particular for their experimental work on the human voice, partially inspired by the work of Roy Hart, who in turn furthered the extended vocal technique initially established by Alfred Wolfsohn. Alan Seymour, speaking of Grotowski's 1963 production of Faustus noted that the performers' voices 'reached from the smallest whisper to an astonishing, almost cavernous tone, an intoned declaiming, of a resonance and power I have not heard from actors before'.Seymour, A. (1987) 'Revelations in Poland.' Plays and Players, 33‚Äì34. The use of non-verbal voice in these productions was part of Grotowski's investigation into the use of the actor's own self as the substance of performance, and his work was founded upon his belief in the ability of a human being to express physically and vocally aspects of the psyche, including those parts allegedly buried in what Carl Jung called the collective unconscious, without recourse to words.Schechner, R. (1985) Between Theatre and Anthroplogy. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. Analytical Psychology Both Grotowski and Hart compared the desired effect of the rehearsal process upon their actors, and the impact of their performances upon the audience to psychotherapy, drawing upon the principles of Carl Jung and Analytical Psychology to explain the principles behind their creativity. Grotowski said that theatre 'is a question of a gathering which is subordinated to ritual: nothing is represented or shown, but we participate in a ceremonial which releases the collective unconscious'.Grotowski, J. (1987) 'Dziady jako model teatru nowoczesnego.' Wspolczesnosc, 21, 1961 Grotowski repeatedly described his rehearsal process and performances as 'sacred', seeking to revive what he understood to be the routes of drama in religious ritual and spiritual practice.Schechner, R. (1995) The Future of Ritual: Writings on Culture and Performance. London: Routledge. To achieve his aims, Grotowski demanded that his actors draw from their psyches images of a collective significance and give them form through the motion of the body and the sound of the voice. Grotowski's ultimate aim was to effect in the actor change and growth, transformation and rebirth in order that the actor, in turn, could precipitate a similar development in the audience.Kumiega, J. (1987) The Theatre of Grotowski. London: Methuen It was for this reason that Grotowski often chose to base productions on works based on ancient narratives. For he believed that they 'embodied myths and images powerful and universal enough to function as archetypes, which could penetrate beneath the apparently divisive and individual structure of the Western psyche, and evoke a spontaneous, collective, internal response'.Grotowski, J., 'Theatre is an Encounter', 1975. James Roose-Evans states that Grotowski's theatre 'speaks directly to the fundamental experience of each person present, to what Jung described as the collective unconscious ... what Grotowski asks of the actor is not that he play the Lady from the Sea or Hamlet, but that he confront these characters within himself and offer the result of that encounter to an audience.Roose- Evans, J. (1989) Experimental Theatre: From Stanislavski to Peter Brook, 4th edn. London: Routledge. Grotowski, like Hart, did not consider the dramatic text or script to be primary in this process, but believed that the text 'becomes theatre only through the actors' use of it, that is to say, thanks to intonations, to the association of sounds, to the musicality of language'. Grotowski thus pursued the possibility of creating 'ideograms' made up of 'sounds and gestures' which 'evoke associations in the psyche of the audience'. But, for Grotowski, as for Hart, there was, between the psyche's reservoir of images and the bodily and vocal expression of that imagery, a series of inhibitions, resistances and blocks, which his acting exercises set out to remove. Many of the acting exercises and rehearsal techniques developed by Grotowski were designed to removing these personal obstacles, which prevented the physical and vocal expression of this imagery, and Grotowski proposed that such a training process 'leads to a liberation from complexes in much the same way as psychoanalytic therapy'.Grotowski, J. The Theatre's New Testament. 1975. = Art as Vehicle = In 1986, Grotowski was invited by Roberto Bacci of the Centro per la Sperimentazione e la Ricerca Teatrale to shift the base of his work to Pontedera, Italy, where he was offered an opportunity to conduct long-term research on performance without the pressure of having to show results until he was ready. Grotowski gladly accepted, taking with him three assistants from Objective Drama research (Richards, Jimenez and Slowiak) to help in founding his Italian Workcenter. Robart also led a work-team in Pontedera for several years, after which time funding cuts necessitated downscaling to a single research group, led by Richards. Grotowski characterized the focus of his attention in his final phase of research as \\"art as a vehicle,\\" a term coined by Peter Brook. \\"It seems to me,\\" Brook said, \\"that Grotowski is showing us something which existed in the past but has been forgotten over the centuries; that is that one of the vehicles which allows man to have access to another level of perception is to be found in the art of performance.\\" Moreover, it was in 1986 that Grotowski changed the name of the Italian centre to the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards, to signal the unique and central place Richards held in his work. Grotowski drove Richards to take on increasingly greater responsibility and leadership in the work, until he was not only the primary doer in the practice of Art as Vehicle, but also its primal leader and \\"director\\" (if such a term can be accurately used) of the performance structures created around these Afro-Caribbean vibratory songs, most significantly 'Downstairs Action' (filmed by Mercedes Gregory in 1989) and 'Action', on which work began in 1994 and continues to the present. Italian actor Mario Biagini, who joined the Workcenter shortly after its founding, also became a central contributor to this research. Although Grotowski died in 1999 at the end of a prolonged illness, the research of Art as Vehicle continues at the Pontedera Workcenter, with Richards as Artistic Director and Biagini as Associate Director. Grotowski's Will declared the two his \\"universal heirs,\\" holders of copyright on the entirety of his textual output and intellectual property.

It also resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It was written by a graduate student at Cornell University, Robert Tappan Morris, and launched on November 2, 1988, from the computer systems of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Architecture  Floppy disk containing the source code for the Morris Worm (also known as The Worm) held at the Computer History Museum According to its creator, Robert Tappan Morris, the Morris worm was not written to cause damage, but to highlight security flaws. The worm was released from MIT in the hope of suggesting that its creator studied there, which Morris did not (though Morris became a tenured professor at MIT in 2006). It worked by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Unix sendmail, finger, and rsh/rexec, as well as weak passwords. Due to reliance on rsh (normally disabled on untrusted networks), fixes to sendmail, finger, the widespread use of network filtering, and improved awareness of the dangers of weak passwords, it should not succeed on a contemporary, properly configured system. A supposedly unintended consequence of the code, however, caused it to be more damaging: a computer could be infected multiple times and each additional process would slow the machine down, eventually to the point of being unusable. This would have the same effect as a fork bomb and crash the computer several times. The main body of the worm could only infect DEC VAX machines running 4BSD, and Sun-3 systems. A portable C \\"grappling hook\\" component of the worm was used to pull over (download) the main body parts, and the grappling hook could run on other systems, loading them down and making them peripheral victims.  The mistake  The critical error that transformed the worm from a potentially harmless intellectual exercise into a virulent denial-of-service attack was in the spreading mechanism. The worm could have determined whether to invade a new computer by asking whether there was already a copy running. But just doing this would have made it trivially easy to stop, as administrators could just run a process that would answer \\"yes\\" when asked whether there was already a copy, and the worm would stay away. The defense against this was inspired by Michael Rabin's mantra \\"Randomization\\". To compensate for this possibility, Morris directed the worm to copy itself, even if the response is \\"yes\\", 1 out of 7 times. This level of replication proved excessive, and the worm spread rapidly, infecting some computers multiple times. Rabin said that Morris \\"should have tried it on a simulator first\\".  Effects of the worm  The U.S. Government Accountability Office put the cost of the damage at $100,000‚Äì10,000,000.During the Morris appeal process, the U.S. Court of Appeals estimated the cost of removing the virus from each installation was in the range of $200‚Äì53,000. Possibly based on these numbers, Clifford Stoll of Harvard estimated the total economic impact was between $100,000‚Äì10,000,000. Clifford Stoll, who helped fight the worm, wrote in 1989, \\"I surveyed the network, and found that two thousand computers were infected within fifteen hours. These machines were dead in the water‚Äîuseless until disinfected. And removing the virus often took two days\\". He said that the worm showed the danger of monoculture, as \\"If all the systems on the Arpanet ran Berkeley Unix, the virus would have disabled all fifty thousand of them\\". It is usually reported that around 6,000 major UNIX machines were infected by the Morris worm; however, Morris' colleague Paul Graham claimed, \\"I was there when this statistic was cooked up, and this was the recipe: someone guessed that there were about 60,000 computers attached to the Internet, and that the worm might have infected ten percent of them.\\" Stoll estimated that \\"only a couple thousand\\" computers were affected, writing that \\"Rumors have it that [Morris] worked with a friend or two at Harvard's computing department (Harvard student Paul Graham sent him mail asking for 'Any news on the brilliant project')\\". The Internet was partitioned for several days, as regional networks disconnected from the NSFNet backbone and from each other to prevent recontamination, as they cleaned their own networks. The Morris worm prompted DARPA to fund the establishment of the CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University, to give experts a central point for coordinating responses to network emergencies. Gene Spafford also created the Phage mailing list to coordinate a response to the emergency. Robert Morris was tried and convicted of violating United States Code: Title 18 (), the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in United States v. Morris. After appeals, he was sentenced to three years' probation, 400 hours of community service, and a fine of $10,050 plus the costs of his supervision.\\"Computer Intruder is Put on Probation and Fined\\" by John Markoff, The New York Times. The total fine ran to $13,326, which included a $10,000 fine, $50 special assessment, and $3,276 cost of probation oversight. The Morris worm has sometimes been referred to as the \\"Great Worm\\", because of the devastating effect it had on the Internet at that time, both in overall system downtime and in psychological impact on the perception of security and reliability of the Internet. The name was derived from the \\"Great Worms\\" of Tolkien: Scatha and Glaurung.  Note  Robert Tappan Morris, the creator of the worm, is the son of Robert Morris, a cryptographer who, at the time, was working for the NSA.  In popular culture  * The 1995 film Hackers features a main character who releases a viral attack bearing several similarities to the Morris worm: the event takes place in 1988, infects over a thousand computers, causes a massive economic disruption, and results in its propagator being fined and put on probation. * In the visual novel Digital: A Love Story, the Morris worm is portrayed as a cover story for a large-scale attack on ARPANET and several bulletin board systems. * In the epilogue of his book The Cuckoo's Egg, Stoll details his efforts battling the Morris worm. * In Halt and Catch Fire, a virus that works in a similar way to the Morris worm is created to gauge the size of the network. * In the webcomic \\"Internet Explorer\\" the Morris Worm is shown as a female character who merely wants to find out the size of the then nascent Internet but inadvertently and thoroughly wreaks havoc wherever she goes.

The GameCube is Nintendo's entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles and is the successor to their previous console, the Nintendo 64. The GameCube competed with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox. The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium. The discs are in a miniDVD-based format but the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs unlike its competitors, and mainly focused on gaming instead. The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable, which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller like a Wii U. Reception of the GameCube was generally positive. The console was praised for its controller, extensive software library and high-quality games, but was criticized for its exterior design and lack of features. Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide before the console was discontinued in 2007. Its successor, the Wii, was released in November 2006. History =Background= In 1997, a graphics hardware design company called ArtX was launched, staffed by twenty engineers who had previously worked at SGI on the design of the Nintendo 64's graphics hardware. The team was led by Dr. Wei Yen, who had been SGI's head of Nintendo Operations, the department responsible for the Nintendo 64's fundamental architectural design. =Development= Partnering with Nintendo in 1998, ArtX began the complete design of the system logic and of the graphics processor (codenamed \\"Flipper\\") of Nintendo's sixth-generation video game console. The console project had a succession of codenames: N2000, Star Cube, and Nintendo Advance. At Nintendo's press conference in May 1999, the console was first publicly announced as \\"Project Dolphin\\", the successor to the Nintendo 64. Subsequently, Nintendo began providing development kits to game developers such as Rare and Retro Studios. Nintendo also formed a strategic partnership with IBM, who created the Dolphin's CPU, named \\"Gekko\\". ArtX was acquired by ATI in April 2000, whereupon the Flipper graphics processor design had already been mostly completed by ArtX and was not overtly influenced by ATI. In total, ArtX team cofounder Greg Buchner recalled that their portion of the console's hardware design timeline had arced from inception in 1998 to completion in 2000. Of ATI's acquisition of ArtX, an ATI spokesperson said, \\"ATI now becomes a major supplier to the game console market via Nintendo. The Dolphin platform is reputed to be king of the hill in terms of graphics and video performance with 128-bit architecture.\\" The console was announced as the GameCube at a press conference in Japan on August 25, 2000, abbreviated as \\"NGC\\" in Japan and \\"GCN\\" in North America. Nintendo unveiled its software lineup for the sixth-generation console at E3 2001, focusing on fifteen launch games, including Luigi's Mansion and Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader. Several games originally scheduled to launch with the console were delayed. It is also the first Nintendo console since the Famicom not to accompany a Super Mario platform game at launch. Long before the console's launch, Nintendo had developed and patented an early prototype of motion controls for the GameCube, with which developer Factor 5 had experimented for its launch games. An interview quoted Greg Thomas, Sega of America's VP of Development as saying, \\"What does worry me is Dolphin's sensory controllers [which are rumored to include microphones and headphone jacks] because there's an example of someone thinking about something different.\\" These motion control concepts would not be deployed to consumers for several years, until the Wii Remote. Prior to the GameCube's release, Nintendo focused resources on the launch of the Game Boy Advance, a handheld game console and successor to the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color. As a result, several games originally destined for the Nintendo 64 console were postponed in favor of becoming early releases on the GameCube. The last first- party game in 2001 for the Nintendo 64 was released in May, a month before the Game Boy Advance's launch and six months before the GameCube's, emphasizing the company's shift in resources. Concurrently, Nintendo was developing software for the GameCube which would provision future connectivity between it and the Game Boy Advance. Certain games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, can use the handheld as a secondary screen and controller when connected to the console via a link cable. Nintendo began its marketing campaign with the catchphrase \\"The Nintendo Difference\\" at its E3 2001 reveal. The goal was to distinguish itself from the competition as an entertainment company. Later advertisements have the slogan, \\"Born to Play\\", and game ads feature a rotating cube animation that morphs into a GameCube logo and ends with a voice whispering, \\"GameCube\\". On May 21, 2001, the console's launch price of was announced, lower than that of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. In September 2020, leaked documents include Nintendo's plans for GameCube model that is both portable with a built-in display and dockable to a TV. Other leaks suggest plans for a GameCube successor, codenamed \\"Tako\\", with HD graphics and slots for SD and memory cards, apparently resulting from a partnership with ATI (now AMD) and scheduled for release in 2005. =Release= The GameCube was launched in Japan on September 14, 2001. Approximately 500,000 units were shipped in time to retailers. The console was scheduled to launch two months later in North America on November 5, 2001, but the date was pushed back in an effort to increase the number of available units. The console eventually launched in North America on November 18, 2001, with over 700,000 units shipped to the region. Other regions followed suit the following year beginning with Europe in the second quarter of 2002. On April 22, 2002, veteran third party Nintendo console developer Factor 5 announced its 3D audio software development kit titled MusyX. In collaboration with Dolby Laboratories, MusyX provides motion- based surround sound encoded as Dolby Pro Logic II. =Discontinuation= In February 2007, Nintendo announced that it had ceased first-party support for the GameCube and that the console had been discontinued, as it was shifting its manufacturing and development efforts towards the Wii and Nintendo DS. Hardware Howard Cheng, technical director of Nintendo technology development, said the company's goal was to select a \\"simple RISC architecture\\" to help speed development of games by making it easier on software developers. IGN reported that the system was \\"designed from the get- go to attract third-party developers by offering more power at a cheaper price. Nintendo's design doc for the console specifies that cost is of utmost importance, followed by space.\\" Hardware partner ArtX's Vice President Greg Buchner stated that their guiding thought on the console's hardware design was to target the developers rather than the players, and to \\"look into a crystal ball\\" and discern \\"what's going to allow the Miyamoto-sans of the world to develop the best games\\". Initiating the GameCube's design in 1998, Nintendo partnered with ArtX (then acquired by ATI Technologies during development) for the system logic and the GPU, and with IBM for the CPU. IBM designed a PowerPC-based processor with custom architectural extensions for the next- generation console, known as Gekko, which runs at 485 MHz and features a floating point unit (FPU) capable of 1.9 GFLOPS. Described as \\"an extension of the IBM Power PC architecture\\", the processor was designed in IBM's 0.18Œºm CMOS technology, which features copper interconnects. Codenamed \\"Flipper\\", the GPU runs at 162 MHz and, in addition to graphics, manages other tasks through its audio and input/output (I/O) processors. The GameCube introduced a proprietary miniDVD optical disc format as the storage medium for the console, capable of storing up to 1.5 GB of data. The technology was designed by Matsushita Electric Industrial (now Panasonic Corporation) which utilizes a proprietary copy-protection scheme‚Äîdifferent from the Content Scramble System (CSS) found in standard DVDs‚Äîto prevent unauthorized reproduction. The Famicom Data Recorder, Famicom Disk System, SNES-CD, and 64DD had explored various complementary storage technologies, but the GameCube was Nintendo's first console to move away from cartridge-based media altogether. The GameCube's 1.5 GB mini-disc have sufficient room for most games, although a few games require an extra disc, higher video compression, or removal of content present in versions on other consoles. By comparison, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, also sixth-generation consoles, both use CDs and DVDs with sizes of up to 8.5 GB. Like its predecessor, the Nintendo 64, GameCube models were produced in several different color motifs. The system launched in \\"Indigo\\", the primary color shown in advertising and on the logo, and in \\"Jet Black\\". A year later, Nintendo released a \\"Platinum\\" limited-edition GameCube, which uses a silver color scheme for both the console and controller. A \\"Spice\\" orange-colored console was eventually released as well only in Japan, though the color scheme could be found on controllers released in other countries. Nintendo developed stereoscopic 3D technology for the GameCube, and one launch game, Luigi's Mansion, supports it. However, the feature was never enabled outside of development. 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays and crystals for the add-on accessories would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. Another unofficial feature are two audio Easter eggs that can be invoked when the console is turned on. When the power is activated with the \\"Z\\" button on the Player 1 controller held down, a more whimsical startup sound is heard in place of the standard one. With four controllers connected, holding down the \\"Z\\" button on all four simultaneously produces a kabuki-style tune at startup. =Storage= Memory Card 59 The GameCube features two memory card ports for saving game data. Nintendo released three official memory card options: Memory Card 59 in gray (512 KB), Memory Card 251 in black (2 MB), and Memory Card 1019 in white (8 MB). These are often advertised in megabits instead: 4 Mb, 16 Mb, and 64 Mb, respectively. A few games were known to have compatibility issues with the Memory Card 1019, and at least two games have save issues with any size. Memory cards with larger capacities were released by third-party manufacturers. =Controller= Nintendo learned from its experiences‚Äîboth positive and negative‚Äîwith the Nintendo 64's three-handled controller design and went with a two-handled, \\"handlebar\\" design for the GameCube. The shape was made popular by Sony's PlayStation controller released in 1994 and its follow-up DualShock series of gamepads introduced in 1997. In addition to vibration feedback, the DualShock series was well known for having two analog sticks to improve the 3D experience in games. Nintendo and Microsoft designed similar features in the controllers for their sixth-generation consoles, but instead of having the analog sticks parallel to each other, they chose to stagger them by swapping the positions of the directional pad (d-pad) and left analog stick. The GameCube controller features a total of eight buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad, and an internal rumble motor. The primary analog stick is on the left with the d-pad located below and closer to the center. On the right are four buttons: a large, green \\"A\\" button in the center, a smaller red \\"B\\" button to the left, an \\"X\\" button to the right, and a \\"Y\\" button at the top. Below and to the inside is a yellow \\"C\\" analog stick, which often serves a variety of in-game functions, such as controlling the camera angle. The Start/Pause button is located in the middle, and the rumble motor is encased within the center of the controller. Indigo GameCube controller On the top of the controller are two \\"pressure-sensitive\\" trigger buttons marked \\"L\\" and \\"R\\". Each essentially provides two functions: one analog and one digital. As the trigger is depressed, it emits an analog signal which increases the more it is pressed in. Once fully depressed, the trigger \\"clicks\\" registering a digital signal that can be used for a separate function within a game. There is also a purple, digital button on the right side marked \\"Z\\". Unique to the GameCube is the controller's prominent size and placement of the A button. Having been the primary action button in past Nintendo controller designs, it was given a larger size and more centralized placement for the GameCube. The rubberized analog stick, in combination with the controller's overall button orientation, was intended to reduce incidences of \\"Nintendo thumb\\" or pain in any part of the hands, wrists, forearms, and shoulders as a result of long- term play. In 2002, Nintendo introduced the WaveBird Wireless Controller, the first wireless gamepad developed by a first-party console manufacturer. The RF-based wireless controller is similar in design to the standard controller. It communicates with the GameCube by way of a wireless receiver dongle connected to one of the console's controller ports. Powered by two AA batteries, which are housed in a compartment on the underside of the controller, the WaveBird lacks the vibration functionality of the standard controller. In addition to the standard inputs, the WaveBird features a channel selection dial‚Äîalso found on the receiver‚Äîand an on/off switch. An orange LED on the face of the controller indicates when it is powered on. The controller is available in light grey and platinum color schemes. =Compatibility= A Platinum GameCube with a WaveBird controller and Game Boy Player attachment The GameCube is unable to play games from other Nintendo home consoles, but with the Game Boy Player attachment, it is able to play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. The GameCube's successor, the Wii, supports backward compatibility with GameCube controllers, memory cards, and games. However, later revisions of the Wii‚Äîincluding the \\"Family Edition\\" released in 2011 and the Wii Mini released in 2012‚Äîdropped support for all GameCube hardware. =Panasonic Q= The Panasonic Q contained a DVD player capable of playing commercial discs. A hybrid version of the GameCube with a commercial DVD player, called Q, was developed by Panasonic as part of the deal struck with Nintendo to develop the optical drive for the original GameCube hardware. Featuring a completely revised case, the Q overcomes the size limitation of the original GameCube's miniDVD tray by adding a commercial DVD-sized tray, among other hardware revisions. Released exclusively in Japan in December 2001, low sales resulted in the Q being discontinued in December 2003. Games In its lifespan of 2001‚Äî2007, over 600 games were released for the GameCube. Nintendo is traditionally recognized for releasing innovative first-party games, most notably from the Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series. These first-party series continued on the GameCube and bolstered the console's popularity. As a publisher, Nintendo also focused on creating new franchises, such as Pikmin and Animal Crossing, and renewing some that skipped the Nintendo 64 platform, most notably the Metroid series with the release of Metroid Prime. The console also saw success with the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Super Mario Sunshine, and its best-selling game, Super Smash Bros. Melee, which sold 7 million copies worldwide. Though committed to its software library, however, Nintendo was still criticized for not featuring enough games during the console's launch window‚Äîa sentiment compounded by the release of Luigi's Mansion instead of a 3D Mario game. Early in Nintendo's history, the company had achieved considerable success with third-party developer support on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES. Competition from the Sega Genesis and Sony's PlayStation in the 1990s changed the market's landscape, however, and reduced Nintendo's ability to obtain exclusive, third-party support on the Nintendo 64. The console's cartridge-based media was also increasing the cost to manufacture software, as opposed to the cheaper, higher-capacity optical discs used by the PlayStation. With the GameCube, Nintendo intended to reverse the trend as evidenced by the number of third-party games available at launch. The new optical disc format introduced with the GameCube increased the capacity significantly and reduced production costs. The strategy mostly worked. High-profile exclusives such as Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader from Factor 5, Resident Evil 4 from Capcom, and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes from Konami were successful. Sega, which became a third-party developer after discontinuing its Dreamcast console, ported Dreamcast games such as Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure 2, and developed new franchises, such as Super Monkey Ball. Several third-party developers were contracted to work on new games for Nintendo franchises, including Star Fox Assault and Donkey Konga by Namco and Wario World from Treasure. Some third-party developers, such as Ubisoft, THQ, Disney Interactive Studios, Humongous Entertainment and EA Sports, continued to release GameCube games into 2007. =Online gaming= A GameCube with a broadband adapter installed and a connected ethernet cable. ASCII Corporation produced a keyboard controller to help players communicate in Phantasy Star Online. Eight GameCube games support network connectivity, five with Internet support and three with local area network (LAN) support. The only Internet capable games released in western territories are three role-playing games (RPGs) in Sega's Phantasy Star series: Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II, Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus, and Phantasy Star Online Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution. The official servers were decommissioned in 2007, but players can still connect to fan maintained private servers. Japan received two additional games with Internet capabilities, a cooperative RPG, Homeland and a baseball game with downloadable content, Jikky≈ç Powerful Pro Yaky≈´ 10. Lastly, three racing games have LAN multiplayer modes: 1080¬∞ Avalanche, Kirby Air Ride, and Mario Kart: Double Dash. These three games can be forced over the Internet with third- party PC software capable of tunneling the GameCube's network traffic. To play online, players must install an official broadband or modem adapter in their system since the GameCube does not have out of the box network capabilities. Nintendo never commissioned any servers or Internet services to interface with the console, but allowed other publishers to do so and made them responsible for managing the online experiences for their games. Reception The GameCube received generally positive reviews following its launch. PC Magazine praised the overall hardware design and quality of games available at launch. CNET gave an average review rating, noting that while the console lacks a few features offered by its competition, it is relatively inexpensive, has a great controller design, and launched a decent lineup of games. In later reviews, criticism mounted against the console often centering on its overall look and feel, describing it as \\"toy-ish.\\" In the midst of poor sales figures and the associated financial harm to Nintendo, a Time International article called the GameCube an \\"unmitigated disaster.\\" Retrospectively, Joystiq compared the GameCube's launch window to its successor, the Wii, noting that the GameCube's \\"lack of games\\" resulted in a subpar launch, and the console's limited selection of online games damaged its market share in the long run. Time International concluded that the system had low sales figures, because it lacked \\"technical innovations\\".McCracken, Harry. \\"Play Hard.

During its launch weekend, the GameCube sold $100 million worth of GameCube products in North America. The console was sold out in several stores, selling faster than both of its competitors, the Xbox and the PlayStation 2, had initially sold. The most popular game at the system's launch was Luigi's Mansion, which, according to Nintendo, sold more at launch than Super Mario 64 had. Other popular games include Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader and Wave Race: Blue Storm. By early December 2001, the system had sold 600,000 units in the US. Nintendo sold 22 million GameCube units worldwide during its lifespan, placing it slightly behind the Xbox's 24 million, and well behind the PlayStation 2's 155 million. The GameCube's predecessor, the Nintendo 64, outperformed it as well, selling nearly 33 million units. The console was able to outsell the short-lived Dreamcast, however, which yielded 9.13 million unit sales. In September 2009, IGN ranked the GameCube 16th in its list of best gaming consoles of all time, placing it behind all three of its sixth-generation competitors: the PlayStation 2 (3rd), the Dreamcast (8th), and the Xbox (11th). As of March 31, 2003, the GameCube had sold 9.55 million units worldwide, falling short of Nintendo's initial goal of 10 million consoles. Many of Nintendo's own first-party games, such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Mario Kart: Double Dash, saw strong sales, though this did not typically benefit third-party developers or directly drive sales of their games. Many cross-platform games‚Äîsuch as sports franchises released by Electronic Arts‚Äîwere sold in numbers far below their PlayStation 2 and Xbox counterparts, eventually prompting some developers to scale back or completely cease support for the GameCube. Exceptions include Sega's family friendly Sonic Adventure 2 and Super Monkey Ball, which reportedly yielded more sales on GameCube than most of the company's games on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. After several years of losing money from developing for Nintendo's console, Eidos Interactive announced in September 2003 that it would end support for the GameCube, canceling several games that were in development. Later, however, Eidos resumed development of GameCube games, releasing hit games such as Lego Star Wars: The Video Game and Tomb Raider: Legend. In addition, several third-party games originally intended to be GameCube exclusives‚Äîmost notably Resident Evil 4‚Äîwere eventually ported to other systems in an attempt to maximize profits following lackluster sales of the original GameCube versions. In March 2003, now-defunct UK retailer Dixons removed all GameCube consoles, accessories and games from its stores. That same month, another UK retailer Argos, cut the price of the GameCube in their stores to ¬£78.99, which was more than ¬£50 cheaper than Nintendo's SRP for the console at the time. With sales sagging and millions of unsold consoles in stock, Nintendo halted GameCube production for the first nine months of 2003 to reduce surplus units.Frederick, Jim, and Toko Sekiguchi. \\"The Console Wars: Game On.\\" Time International (South Pacific Edition) 49 (2003): 56-59. Business Source Complete. Web. July 24, 2013. Sales rebounded slightly after a price drop to US$99.99 on September 24, 2003 and the release of The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition bundle. A demo disc, the GameCube Preview Disc, was also released in a bundle in 2003. Beginning with this period, GameCube sales continued to be steady, particularly in Japan, but the GameCube remained in third place in worldwide sales during the sixth-generation era because of weaker sales performance elsewhere. Iwata told investors that the GameCube would sell 50 million units worldwide by March 2005, but by the end of 2006, it had only sold 21.7 million, selling fewer than half of what Nintendo forecasted. =Market share= With the GameCube, Nintendo failed to reclaim the market share lost by its predecessor, the Nintendo 64. Throughout the lifespan of its console generation, GameCube hardware sales remained far behind its direct competitor the PlayStation 2, and slightly behind the Xbox. The console's \\"family-friendly\\" appeal and lack of support from certain third- party developers skewed the GameCube toward a younger market, which was a minority demographic of the gaming population during the sixth generation. Many third-party games popular with teenagers or adults, such as the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto series and several key first-person shooters, skipped the GameCube entirely in favor of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. , the GameCube had a 13% market share, tying with the Xbox in sales but far below the 60% of the PlayStation 2. =Legacy= Many games that debuted on the GameCube, including Pikmin, Chibi-Robo!, Metroid Prime, and Luigi's Mansion became popular Nintendo franchises or subseries. GameCube controllers have limited support on Wii U and Nintendo Switch, to play Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate respectively, via a USB adapter.

He had a mythic status that operated on a number of interconnected levels: Protestant missionary martyr, working-class \\"rags-to-riches\\" inspirational story, scientific investigator and explorer, imperial reformer, anti-slavery crusader, and advocate of British commercial and colonial expansion. Livingstone's fame as an explorer and his obsession with learning the sources of the Nile River was founded on the belief that if he could solve that age-old mystery, his fame would give him the influence to end the East African Arab-Swahili slave trade. \\"The Nile sources,\\" he told a friend, \\"are valuable only as a means of opening my mouth with power among men. It is this power [with] which I hope to remedy an immense evil.\\" His subsequent exploration of the central African watershed was the culmination of the classic period of European geographical discovery and colonial penetration of Africa. At the same time, his missionary travels, \\"disappearance\\", and eventual death in Africaand subsequent glorification as a posthumous national hero in 1874led to the founding of several major central African Christian missionary initiatives carried forward in the era of the European \\"Scramble for Africa\\". Early life Livingstone's birthplace in Blantyre David Livingstone's birthplace, with period furnishings Livingstone was born on 19 March 1813 in the mill town of Blantyre, Scotland, in a tenement building for the workers of a cotton factory on the banks of the River Clyde under the bridge crossing into Bothwell. He was the second of seven children born to Neil Livingstone (1788‚Äì1856) and his wife Agnes (n√©e Hunter; 1782‚Äì1865). David was employed at the age of ten in the cotton mill of Henry Monteith & Co. in Blantyre Works. He and his brother John worked twelve-hour days as piecers, tying broken cotton threads on the spinning machines. Neil Livingstone was a Sunday school teacher and teetotaller who handed out Christian tracts on his travels as a door-to-door tea salesman. He read books on theology, travel, and missionary enterprises extensively. This rubbed off on the young David, who became an avid reader, but he also loved scouring the countryside for animal, plant, and geological specimens in local limestone quarries. Neil feared that science books were undermining Christianity and attempted to force his son to read nothing but theology, but David's deep interest in nature and science led him to investigate the relationship between religion and science. In 1832, he read Philosophy of a Future State, written by Thomas Dick, and he found the rationale that he needed to reconcile faith and science and, apart from the Bible, this book was perhaps his greatest philosophical influence. Other significant influences in his early life were Thomas Burke, a Blantyre evangelist, and David Hogg, his Sunday school teacher. At age nineteen, David left the Church of Scotland for a local Congregational church, influenced by preachers like Ralph Wardlaw, who denied predestinarian limitations on salvation. Influenced by revivalistic teachings in the United States, Livingstone entirely accepted the proposition put by Charles Finney, Professor of Theology at Oberlin College, Ohio, that \\"the Holy Spirit is open to all who ask it\\". For Livingstone, this meant a release from the fear of eternal damnation. Livingstone's reading of missionary Karl G√ºtzlaff's Appeal to the Churches of Britain and America on behalf of China enabled him to persuade his father that medical study could advance religious ends. Livingstone's experiences in H. Monteith's Blantyre cotton mill were also important from ages 10 to 26, first as a piecer and later as a spinner. This monotonous work was necessary to support his impoverished family, but it taught him persistence, endurance, and a natural empathy with all who labour, as expressed by lines that he used to hum from the egalitarian Rabbie Burns song: \\"When man to man, the world o'er/Shall brothers be for a' that\\". Education Livingstone attended Blantyre village school, along with the few other mill children with the endurance to do so despite their 14-hour workday (6 am‚Äì8 pm). Having a family with a strong, ongoing commitment to study reinforced his education. After reading the appeal by Gutzlaff for medical missionaries for China in 1834, he began saving money to enter Anderson's University, Glasgow in 1836 (now University of Strathclyde), as well as attending Greek and theology lectures at the University of Glasgow. To enter medical school, he required some knowledge of Latin. He was tutored by a local Roman Catholic man, Daniel Gallagher. Later in life, Gallagher became a priest and founded the third oldest Catholic Church in Glasgow: St Simon's, Partick. A painting of both Gallagher and Livingstone by Roy Petrie hangs in that church's coffee room. In addition to his other studies, he attended divinity lectures by Wardlaw, a leader at this time of vigorous anti-slavery campaigning in the city. Shortly after, he applied to join the London Missionary Society (LMS) and was accepted subject to missionary training. He was a student at the Charing Cross Hospital Medical School in 1838‚Äì40, with his courses covering medical practice, midwifery, and botany. During this period he also spent time on missionary training in London and in Ongar, Essex, to become a minister within the Congregational Union serving under the LMS. While training under the LMS, he and other students were taught Greek, Latin, Hebrew and theology by the Reverend Richard Cecil. Despite his impressive personality, he was a plain preacher, described by Cecil as \\"worthy but remote from brilliant\\" and would have been rejected by the LMS had the director not given him a second chance to pass the course. He qualified as a Licentiate of the Faculty (now Royal College) of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow on 16 November 1840, and was later made an Honorary Fellow of the Faculty, on 5 January 1857. Vision for Africa Zulu dance, from Livingstone's Narrative of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries Livingstone hoped to go to China as a missionary, but the First Opium War broke out in September 1839 and the LMS suggested the West Indies instead. In 1840, while continuing his medical studies in London, Livingstone met LMS missionary Robert Moffat, on leave from Kuruman, a missionary outpost in South Africa, north of the Orange River. He was excited by Moffat's vision of expanding missionary work northwards, and he was also influenced by abolitionist T.F. Buxton's arguments that the African slave trade might be destroyed through the influence of \\"legitimate trade\\" and the spread of Christianity. Livingstone, therefore, focused his ambitions on Southern Africa. Livingstone was deeply influenced by Moffat's judgement that he was the right person to go to the vast plains to the north of Bechuanaland, where he had glimpsed \\"the smoke of a thousand villages, where no missionary had ever been\\". During this time, he visited Mabotsa, Botswana (near Zeerust, North West Province, South Africa) an area where there were many lions terrorizing the villagers. They stated, \\"The lion, the lord of the night, kills our cattle and sheep even in the daytime\\". Livingstone felt that, if he could kill just one lion, the others would take it as a warning and leave the villages and their livestock alone. Therefore, he led the villagers on a lion hunt. Seeing a large lion, he fired his gun, but the animal was not sufficiently injured to prevent it from attacking him while re-loading, seriously wounding his left arm. The broken bone, even though inexpertly set by himself and a missionary's daughter, bonded strongly, enabling him to shoot and lift heavy weights, though it remained a source of much suffering for the rest of his life, and he was not able to lift the arm higher than his shoulder. Exploration of southern and central Africa The journeys of Livingstone in Africa between 1851 and 1873 Livingstone was obliged to leave his first mission at Mabotsa in Botswana in 1845 after irreconcilable differences emerged between him and his fellow missionary, Rogers Edwards, and because the Bakgatla were proving indifferent to the Gospel. He abandoned Chonuane, his next mission, in 1847 because of drought and the proximity of the Boers and his desire \\"to move on to the regions beyond\\". At Kolobeng Mission Livingstone converted Chief Sechele in 1849 after two years of patient persuasion, but only a few months later Sechele lapsed. In 1851, when Livingstone finally left Kolobeng, he did not use this failure to explain his departure, although it played an important part in his decision. Just as important had been the three journeys far to the north of Kolobeng which he had undertaken between 1849 and 1851 and which had left him convinced that the best long-term chance for successful evangelising was to explore Africa in advance of European commercial interest and other missionaries by mapping and navigating its rivers which might then become \\"Highways\\" into the interior. Livingstone departed from the village of Linyanti, located roughly in the center of the continent on the Zambezi river. Livingstone had reached this point coming from the south, in Cape Town, it was the northern frontier missionary post. Livingstone set out from Linyanti to the north-west, up the Zambezi, believing this would map the best \\"highway\\" into Africa. He had the help of 27 African guides and warriors loaned by Sekeletu, chief of the Kololo in Linyanti. They reached the Portuguese city of Luanda on the Atlantic after profound difficulties and the near-death of Livingstone from fever. Livingstone realized the route would be too difficult for future traders, so he retraced the journey back to Linyanti. Then with 114 men, loaned by the same chief, he set off east down the Zambezi. On this leg he became the first European to see the Mosi-o-Tunya (\\"the smoke that thunders\\") waterfall, which he named Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. Eventually he successfully reached Quelimane on the Indian Ocean, having mapped most of the course of the Zambezi river. In this way Livingstone became the first European to cross south-central Africa which had never been crossed by Europeans at that latitude before. Livingstone's accomplishment made him famous. But it was not without precedent; a few years earlier, in 1853-1854, two Arab traders crossed the continent from Zanzibar to Benguela; and in the first decade of the 1800s, two native traders crossed from Angola to Mozambique; and Portuguese traders had already penetrated to the middle of the continent from both sides. These non-European accomplishments were little known or cared about in Europe and so Livingstone was hailed the explorer who \\"opened up\\" Africa. Livingstone preaching the gospel to unconverted Africans. Like other missionaries of the era he had a low success rate and is credited with a single conversion. Livingstone advocated the establishment of trade and religious missions in central Africa, but abolition of the African slave trade, as carried out by the Portuguese of Tete and the Arab Swahili of Kilwa, became his primary goal. His motto‚Äînow inscribed on his statue at Victoria Falls‚Äîwas \\"\\", a combination that he hoped would form an alternative to the slave trade, and impart dignity to the Africans in the eyes of Europeans. He believed that the key to achieving these goals was the navigation of the Zambezi River as a Christian commercial highway into the interior. He returned to Britain to garner support for his ideas, and to publish a book on his travels which brought him fame as one of the leading explorers of the age. Slave traders and their captives bound in chains and collared with 'taming sticks'. From Livingstone's Narrative Livingstone believed that he had a spiritual calling for exploration to find routes for commercial trade which would displace slave trade routes, rather than for preaching. He was encouraged by the response in Britain to his discoveries and support for future expeditions, so he resigned from the London Missionary Society in 1857. According to his Victorian biographer W. Garden Blaikie, the reason was to prevent public concerns that his non-missionary activities such as his scientific work might show the LMS to be \\"departing from the proper objects of a missionary body\\". Livingstone had written to the directors of the society to express complaints about their policies and the clustering of too many missionaries near the Cape Colony, despite the sparse native population. Blaikie, not wishing to offend Livingstone's relatives, still living in 1880 when his book was published, concealed the real reason why Livingstone left the LMS and the manner of it. In a letter from the directors of the LMS, which Livingstone received at Quelimane, he was congratulated on his journey but was told that the directors were \\"restricted in their power of aiding plans connected only remotely with the spread of the Gospel\\". This brusque rejection of his plan for new mission stations north of the Zambesi and his wider object of opening the interior via the Zambezi, was not enough to make him resign at once. When he was approached by Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, who put him in touch with the Foreign Secretary, Livingstone said nothing to the LMS directors, even when his leadership of a government expedition to the Zambezi seemed increasingly likely to be funded by the Exchequer. \\"I am not yet fairly on with the Government,\\" he told a friend, \\"but am nearly quite off with the Society (LMS).\\" And while he negotiated with the government, he deceived the LMS into thinking that he would return to Africa with their mission to the Kololo in Barotseland, which Livingstone had used his national fame to coerce them into initiating against their better judgement. The end result would be the death of a missionary and his wife, the death of a second missionary's wife and the deaths of three children from malaria. Livingstone had suffered over thirty attacks during his journey but had deliberately understated his suffering so as not to discourage the LMS from sending missionaries to the Kololo. Consequently, the missionaries had set out for a marshy region with wholly inadequate supplies of quinine and they had soon weakened and died. In May 1857 Livingstone was appointed as Her Majesty's Consul with a roving commission, extending through Mozambique to the areas west of it.Livingstone to Lord Clarendon 19 March 1857 Clarendon Papers Bodleian Library Dep. c 80 In February 1858 his area of jurisdiction was stipulated to be \\"the Eastern Coast of Africa and the independent districts in the interior\\".C. A. Baker, \\"The Development of the Administration to 1897\\", in The Early History of Malawi, edited by Bridglal Pachai (London, Longman, 1972), p. 324. =Zambezi expedition= The British government agreed to fund Livingstone's idea and he returned to Africa as head of the Second Zambesi Expedition to examine the natural resources of southeastern Africa and open up the Zambezi River. However, it turned out to be completely impassable to boats past the Cahora Bassa rapids, a series of cataracts and rapids that Livingstone had failed to explore on his earlier travels. Burial site of Mary Moffat Livingstone in Chupanga, Mozambique The expedition lasted from March 1858 until the middle of 1864. Expedition members recorded that Livingstone was an inept leader incapable of managing a large-scale project. He was also said to be secretive, self-righteous, and moody, and could not tolerate criticism, all of which severely strained the expedition and which led to his physician John Kirk writing in 1862, \\"I can come to no other conclusion than that Dr Livingstone is out of his mind and a most unsafe leader\\". Artist Thomas Baines was dismissed from the expedition on charges of theft (which he vigorously denied). The expedition became the first to reach Lake Malawi and they explored it in a four-oared gig. In 1862, they returned to the coast to await the arrival of a steam boat specially designed to sail on Lake Malawi. Mary Livingstone arrived along with the boat. She died on 27 April 1862 from malaria and Livingstone continued his explorations. Attempts to navigate the Ruvuma River failed because of the continual fouling of the paddle wheels from the bodies thrown in the river by slave traders, and Livingstone's assistants gradually died or left him. It was at this point that he uttered his most famous quotation, \\"I am prepared to go anywhere, provided it be forward.\\" He eventually returned home in 1864 after the government ordered the recall of the expedition because of its increasing costs and failure to find a navigable route to the interior. The Zambezi Expedition was castigated as a failure in many newspapers of the time, and Livingstone experienced great difficulty in raising funds to further explore Africa. Nevertheless, John Kirk, Charles Meller, and Richard Thornton, the scientists appointed to work under Livingstone, did contribute large collections of botanical, ecological, geological, and ethnographic material to scientific Institutions in the United Kingdom. =Nile River= In January 1866, Livingstone returned to Africa, this time to Zanzibar, and from there he set out to seek the source of the Nile. Richard Francis Burton, John Hanning Speke, and Samuel Baker had identified either Lake Albert or Lake Victoria as the source (which was partially correct, as the Nile \\"bubbles from the ground high in the mountains of Burundi halfway between Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria\\"), but there was still serious debate on the matter. Livingstone believed that the source was farther south and assembled a team to find it consisting of freed slaves, Comoros Islanders, twelve Sepoys, and two servants from his previous expedition, Chuma and Susi. This house in Mikindani in southern Tanzania was the starting point for Livingstone's last expedition. He stayed here from 24 March to 7 April 1866. Livingstone set out from the mouth of the Ruvuma river, but his assistants gradually began deserting him. The Comoros Islanders had returned to Zanzibar and (falsely) informed authorities that Livingstone had died. He reached Lake Malawi on 6 August, by which time most of his supplies had been stolen, including all his medicines. Livingstone then travelled through swamps in the direction of Lake Tanganyika, with his health declining. He sent a message to Zanzibar requesting that supplies be sent to Ujiji and he then headed west, forced by ill health to travel with slave traders. He arrived at Lake Mweru on 8 November 1867 and continued on, travelling south to become the first European to see Lake Bangweulu. Upon finding the Lualaba River, Livingstone theorised that it could have been the high part of the Nile River; but realised that it in fact flowed into the River Congo at Upper Congo Lake. The year 1869 began with Livingstone finding himself extremely ill while in the jungle. He was saved by Arab traders who gave him medicines and carried him to an Arab outpost. In March 1869, Livingstone suffered from pneumonia and arrived in Ujiji to find his supplies stolen. He was coming down with cholera and had tropical ulcers on his feet, so he was again forced to rely on slave traders to get him as far as Bambara‚Äîwhere he was caught by the wet season. With no supplies, Livingstone had to eat his meals in a roped-off enclosure for the entertainment of the locals in return for food. On 15 July 1871, Livingstone stated in his diary that he witnessed around 400 Africans being massacred by men of the Arab ruler and slaver Dugumbe, an associate of his, while he was visiting Nyangwe on the banks of the Lualaba River. The cause behind this attack is stated to be retaliation for actions of Manilla, the head slave who had sacked villages of Mohombo people at the instigation of the Wagenya chieftain Kimburu. The Arabs attacked the shoppers and Kimburu's people. Researchers from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania who scanned Livingstone's diary suspect he may have been lying about the massacre and his own men might have been involved in it. The account describing the massacre was changed in the \\"Last Journals\\" published in 1874. While his published journal blamed Dugumbe's men, it is Manilla who seems to be leading the raid and breaking the treaty with Kimburu according to the researchers who decoded his diary. In the diary, he states that he had sent the Banian slaves, liberated slaves who were sent to him by John Kirk, to assist Manilla's brother - which may indicate their role in the attack. Moreover, records in his field diary don't seem to dispute Moslem accusations against the English for the massacre. In the published journal however, events are changed and much of the reprobate behaviour of Banian slaves mentioned by Livingstone is omitted. The research director Adrian Wisnicki, however, advised caution saying: \\"We're only beginning to analyze the evidence.\\" The massacre horrified Livingstone, leaving him too shattered to continue his mission to find the source of the Nile. Following the end of the wet season, he travelled from Nyangwe back to Ujiji, an Arab settlement on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika ‚Äì violently ill most of the way ‚Äì arriving on 23 October 1871. =Geographical discoveries= Livingstone was wrong about the Nile, but he identified numerous geographical features for Western science, such as Lake Ngami, Lake Malawi, and Lake Bangweulu, in addition to Victoria Falls mentioned above. He filled in details of Lake Tanganyika, Lake Mweru, and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was the north end of Lake Tanganyika ‚Äì still south of the Equator ‚Äì and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the River Congo any farther downstream than Ntangwe near Misisi.\\"Map of Livingstone's travels\\", National Museums of Scotland.

Stanley meeting Livingstone Memorial Sculpture in Ujiji, Africa Henry Morton Stanley meets David Livingstone Livingstone Memorial in Ujiji, Tanzania David Livingstone memorial at Victoria Falls, the first statue on the Zimbabwean side Livingstone completely lost contact with the outside world for six years and was ill for most of the last four years of his life. Only one of his 44 letter dispatches made it to Zanzibar. One surviving letter to Horace Waller was made available to the public in 2010 by its owner Peter Beard. It reads: \\"I am terribly knocked up but this is for your own eye only, ... Doubtful if I live to see you again ...\\"Livingstone's Letter from Bambarre , emelibrary.org; accessed 4 July 2010. Henry Morton Stanley had been sent to find him by the New York Herald newspaper in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, greeting him with the now famous words \\"Dr Livingstone, I presume?\\" Livingstone responded, \\"Yes\\", and then \\"I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you.\\" These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone's account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a New York Herald editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humour, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles; and Stanley's clumsy attempt at being posh in the bush of Africa, it was a cool indirect aristocratic greeting one might expect to hear in an upper-class London club, readers of the Herald immediately saw through its pretensions. As noted by his biographer Tim Jeal (2007), Stanley struggled his whole life with manufacturing events to paper over a self-perceived weakness of being from a humble background. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment because he did not dare to embrace him. Despite Stanley's urgings, Livingstone was determined not to leave Africa until his mission was complete. His illness made him confused and he had judgment difficulties at the end of his life. He explored the Lualaba and, failing to find connections to the Nile, returned to Lake Bangweulu and its swamps to explore possible rivers flowing out northwards. Christianity and Sechele Livingstone is known as \\"Africa's greatest missionary,\\" yet he is recorded as having converted only one African: Sechele, who was the chief of the Kwena people of Botswana (Kwena are one of the main Sotho-Tswana clans, found in South Africa, Lesotho, and Botswana in all three Sotho-Tswana language groupings). Sechele was born in 1812. His father died when Sechele was 10, and two of his uncles divided the tribe, which forced Sechele to leave his home for nine years. When Sechele returned, he took over one of his uncle's tribes; at that point, he met David Livingstone. Livingstone was known through a large part of Africa for treating the natives with respect, and the tribes that he visited returned his respect with faith and loyalty. He could never permanently convert the tribesmen to Christianity, however. Among other reasons, Sechele, by then the leader of the African tribe, did not like the way that Livingstone could not demand rain of his God like his rainmakers, who said that they could. After long hesitation from Livingstone, he baptised Sechele and had the church completely embrace him. Sechele was now a part of the church, but he continued to act according to his African culture, which went against Livingstone's teachings. Sechele was no different from any other man of his tribe in believing in polygamy. He had five wives, and when Livingstone told him to get rid of four of them, it shook the foundations of the Kwena tribe. After he finally divorced the women, Livingstone baptised them all and everything went well. However, one year later one of his ex-wives became pregnant and Sechele was the father. Sechele begged Livingstone not to give up on him because his faith was still strong, but Livingstone left the country and went north to continue his Christianizing attempts. Livingstone immediately became interested in Sechele, and especially his ability to read. Being a quick learner, Sechele learned the alphabet in two days and soon called English a second language. After teaching his wives the skill, he wrote the Bible in his native tongue. After Livingstone left the Kwena tribe, Sechele remained faithful to Christianity and led missionaries to surrounding tribes as well as converting nearly his entire Kwena people. In the estimation of Neil Parsons of the University of Botswana, Sechele \\"did more to propagate Christianity in 19th-century southern Africa than virtually any single European missionary\\". Although Sechele was a self-proclaimed Christian, many European missionaries disagreed. The Kwena tribe leader kept rainmaking a part of his life as well as polygamy. Death David Livingstone Medal Livingstone died on 1 May 1873 at the age of 60 in Chief Chitambo's village at Ilala, southeast of Lake Bangweulu, in present-day Zambia, from malaria and internal bleeding due to dysentery. His loyal attendants Chuma and Susi removed his heart and buried it under a tree near the spot where he died, which has been identified variously as a Mvula tree or a Baobab tree. That site, now known as the Livingstone Memorial, lists his date of death as 4 May, the date reported (and carved into the tree's trunk) by Chuma and Susi; but most sources consider 1 May‚Äîthe date of Livingstone's final journal entry‚Äîas the correct one. The rest of his remains were carried, together with his journal, over , a journey that took 63 days, by Chuma and Susi to the coastal town of Bagamoyo, where they were returned by ship to Britain for burial. In London, his body lay in repose at No.1 Savile Row, then the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, prior to interment at Westminster Abbey.David Livingstone.

Livingstone and slavery Arab slave traders and their captives While talking about the slave trade in East Africa in his journals: Livingstone wrote about a group of slaves forced to march by Arab slave traders in the African Great Lakes region when he was travelling there in 1866: He also described: Livingstone's letters, books, and journals did stir up public support for the abolition of slavery; however, he became dependent for assistance on the very slave-traders whom he wished to put out of business. He was a poor leader of his peers, and he ended up on his last expedition as an individualist explorer with servants and porters but no expert support around him. At the same time, he did not use the brutal methods of maverick explorers such as Stanley to keep his retinue of porters in line and his supplies secure. For these reasons, he accepted help and hospitality from 1867 onwards from Mohamad Bogharib and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as \\"Mpamari\\"), traders who kept and traded in slaves, as he recounts in his journals. They, in turn, benefited from Livingstone's influence with local people, which facilitated Mpamari's release from bondage to Mwata Kazembe. Livingstone was furious to discover that some of the replacement porters sent at his request from Ujiji were slaves. Livingstone's figures on slaves have however been criticised as highly exaggerated. Legacy A new statue of David Livingstone on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls By the late 1860s Livingstone's reputation in Europe had suffered owing to the failure of the missions he set up, and of the Zambezi Expedition; and his ideas about the source of the Nile were not supported. His expeditions were hardly models of order and organisation. His reputation was rehabilitated by Stanley and his newspaper, and by the loyalty of Livingstone's servants whose long journey with his body inspired wonder. The publication of his last journal revealed stubborn determination in the face of suffering. In 1860, the Universities' Mission to Central Africa was founded at his request. Many important missionaries, such as Leader Stirling and Miss Annie Allen, would later work for this group. This group and the medical missionaries it sponsored came to have major, positive impact on the people of Africa. Livingstone made geographical discoveries for European knowledge. He inspired abolitionists of the slave trade, explorers, and missionaries. He opened up Central Africa to missionaries who initiated the education and healthcare for Africans, and trade by the African Lakes Company. He was held in some esteem by many African chiefs and local people and his name facilitated relations between them and the British. Livingstone statue, Edinburgh by Amelia Robertson Hill Partly as a result, within 50 years of his death, colonial rule was established in Africa, and white settlement was encouraged to extend further into the interior. However, what Livingstone envisaged for \\"colonies\\" was not what we now know as colonial rule, but rather settlements of dedicated Christian Europeans who would live among the people to help them work out ways of living that did not involve slavery. Livingstone was part of an evangelical and nonconformist movement in Britain which during the 19th century helped change the national mindset from the notion of a divine right to rule 'lesser races', to more modernly ethical ideas in foreign policy. The David Livingstone Centre in Blantyre celebrates his life and is based in the house in which he was born, on the site of the mill in which he started his working life. His Christian faith is evident in his journal, in which one entry reads: \\"I place no value on anything I have or may possess, except in relation to the kingdom of Christ. If anything will advance the interests of the kingdom, it shall be given away or kept, only as by giving or keeping it I shall promote the glory of Him to whom I owe all my hopes in time and eternity.\\" According to Alvyn Austin in 1997: :During the anti-colonial 1960s, Livingstone was debunked: he made only one certified convert, who later backslid; he explored few areas not already traveled by others; he freed few slaves; he treated his colleagues horribly; he traveled with Arab slave traders; his family life was in shamblesin short, to many he embodied the \\"White Man's Burden\\" mentality. Nonetheless, at a time when countries are being renamed and statues are being toppled, Livingstone has not fallen. Despite modern Africans' animosity toward other Europeans, such as Cecil Rhodes, Livingstone endures as a heroic legend. Rhodesia has long since purged its name, but the cities of Livingstone (Zambia) and Livingstonia (Malawi) keep the explorer's appellation with pride.Alvyn Austin, \\"Discovering Livingstone\\" Christian History (1997) 16#4 pp 10-19. In 2002, David Livingstone was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. Family life Posthumous portrait of David Livingstone by Frederick Havill While Livingstone had a great impact on British Imperialism, he did so at a tremendous cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he wed in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862. He had six children: # Robert died in the American Civil War; He took the name Rupert Vincent and was the substitute for Horace Heath, and took his place in Company H of the 3rd New Hampshire Volunteers. Robert ended up being captured and he died at the Salisbury POW camp in North Carolina. # Agnes (born 1847) # Thomas # Elizabeth (who died at two months) # William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851) # Anna Mary (born 1858) Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life was that he did not spend enough time with his children. Archives The archives of David Livingstone are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).

It was described in 1874 from Mexico. Portrayal in film and books Livingstone has been portrayed by M.A. Wetherell in Livingstone (1925), Percy Marmont in David Livingstone (1936), Sir Cedric Hardwicke in Stanley and Livingstone (1939), Bernard Hill in Mountains of the Moon (1990) and Sir Nigel Hawthorne in the TV movie Forbidden Territory (1997). The 1949 comedy film Africa Screams is the story of a dimwitted clerk named Stanley Livington (played by Lou Costello), who is mistaken for a famous African explorer and recruited to lead a treasure hunt. The character's name appears to be a play on Stanley and Livingstone. Published in 2019 the novel of historical fiction Out of Darkness, Shining Light by Petina Gappah portrays the story of how Dr. Livingstone's body, papers, and maps traveled 1,500 miles across the continent of Africa, so his remains could be returned to England and his work preserved there. In popular culture The ABBA song \\"What about Livingstone?\\" mentions Livingstone travelling up the Nile.

It is named after the town of Gruy√®res. In 2001, Gruy√®re gained the appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC, now AOP). Gruy√®re is sweet but slightly salty, with a flavor that varies widely with age. It is often described as creamy and nutty when young, becoming more assertive, earthy, and complex as it matures. When fully aged (five months to a year), it tends to have small cracks that impart a slightly grainy texture. Uses Smoked Gruy√®re cheese Gruy√®re cheese is generally known as one of the finest cheeses for baking, having a distinctive but not overpowering taste. In quiche, Gruy√®re adds savoriness without overshadowing the other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, particularly suited for fondues, along with Vacherin Fribourgeois and Emmental. It is also traditionally used in French onion soup, as well as in croque-monsieur, a classic French toasted ham and cheese sandwich. Gruy√®re is also used in chicken and veal cordon bleu. It is a fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop le tourin, a type of garlic soup from France which is served on dried bread. White wines, such as Riesling, pair well with Gruy√®re. Sparkling cider and Bock beer are also beverage affinities. Production Rounds of Gruy√®re cheese on sale in a wholesale food market in France To make Gruy√®re, raw milk is heated to in a copper vat, and then curdled by the addition of liquid rennet. The curd is cut up into pea sized pieces and stirred, releasing whey. The curd is cooked at , and raised quickly to . The whey is strained, and the curds placed into molds to be pressed. After salting in brine and smearing with bacteria,Fox, Patrick. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology. p. 200. the cheese is ripened for two months at room temperature, generally on wooden boards, turning every couple of days to ensure even moisture distribution. Gruy√®re can be cured for 3 to 10 months, with long curing producing a cheese of intense flavor. Gruy√®re in Switzerland In 2001, Gruy√®re gained the Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e status. Since then the production and the maturation is defined in the Swiss law, and all Swiss Gruy√®re producers must follow these rules. Gruy√®re around the world Gruy√®re-style cheeses are very popular in Greece, where the local varieties are known as Œ≥œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒπŒ≠œÅŒ± (gravi√©ra). Some Greek gruy√®res come from San Mich√°lƒì (ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ ŒúŒπœáŒ¨ŒªŒ∑, \\"St. Michael's\\") from the island of Syros in the Cyclades, the Naxian varieties, that tend to be milder and more sweet and various gravi√©ras from Crete. Kars gravyer cheese is a Turkish cheese made of cow's milk or a mixture of cow and goat milk. Gruy√®re-style cheeses are also produced in the United States, with Wisconsin having the largest output, and in Bosnia under the name Livanjski sir (Livno cheese). Affinage The affinage cellar in the Maison du Gruy√®re, in Gruy√®res, Switzerland An important and the longest part of the production of the Le Gruy√®re Switzerland AOC is the affinage (French for maturation). According to the AOC, the cellars to mature a Swiss Gruy√®re must have a climate close to that of a natural cave. This means that the humidity should be between 94% and 98%. If the humidity is lower, the cheese dries out. If the humidity is too high, the cheese does not mature and becomes smeary and gluey. The temperature of the caves should be between and . This relatively high temperature is required for excellent quality cheese. Lower quality cheeses result from temperatures between and . The lower the temperature is, the less the cheese matures, resulting in a texture that is harder and more crumbly. Varieties Le Gruy√®re Premier Cru Le Gruy√®re Switzerland AOC has many different varieties, with different aged profiles, and an organic version of the cheese is also sold. There is a special variety that is produced only in summer on the Swiss Alps: the Le Gruy√®re Switzerland AOC Alpage. Generally, one can distinguish the age profiles of mild/doux (minimum 5 months old) and r√©serve, also known as surchoix (minimum 10 months old). In Switzerland, other age profiles can be found, including mi-sal√© (7‚Äì8 months), sal√© (9‚Äì10 months), vieux (14 months), and H√∂hlengereift (cave aged), but these age profiles are not part of the AOC. The French Le Brou√®re cheese, made in nearby Vosges, is considered a variant of Gruy√®re.Ridgway, J., Weinzweig, A., & Hill, S. (2004). The cheese companion: The connoisseur's guide. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Running Press Le Gruy√®re AOP Premier Cru Le Gruy√®re Premier Cru is a special variety, produced and matured exclusively in the canton of Fribourg and matured for 14 months in humid cellars with a humidity of 95% and a temperature of .

It is a hard, crumbly cheese. \\"Vinney\\" is a local Dorset term related to the obsolete word \\"vinew\\", which means to become mouldy. Another explanation has it that \\"vinny\\" is a corruption of \\"veiny\\", referring to the blue veins running throughout the cheese. Historically the cheese was merely a by-product of the much more lucrative butter market. Milk was of little value before the railways as it could not be brought to market before it went off, thus cheese and butter production was the main focus of dairy farms. Dorset butter was highly regarded in London where it fetched a premium price but making butter left the farmers with large quantities of skimmed milk which they turned into a hard, crumbly cheese. While the cheese was a common farmhouse cheese in Dorset for hundreds of years, production nearly dried up after the Second World War, and was made in very small quantities on just a few farms. However, in the 1980s Woodbridge Farm in Dorset revived the old recipe, and it is now producing the cheese again. In his poem \\"Praise O' Do'set\\",Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect by William Barnes. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd., 1903 the Dorset poet William Barnes asks, :Woont ye have brown bread a-put ye, :An' some vinny cheese a-cut ye? It is often made from unpasteurised milk. This is considered healthy by some and risky by others due to the potential for tuberculosis from infected cows passing into the milk. It has a strong taste and smell. Blue Vinney goes well with Dorset knobs, another traditional product from Dorset. Dorset Blue Cheese has been awarded Protected Geographical Status, ensuring only cheese originating from Dorset may use the name. Local myth describes how in years gone by, due to its supposed illegal nature, Blue Vinny would be left on the doorstep of those who ordered it on the black market. Health risks The fungus used for blue cheeses, Penicillium roqueforti also produces the mycotoxin Aristolochene, as well as the neurotoxic Roquefortine C.

Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received numerous posthumous awards, including canonization by the African Orthodox Church and a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. With reprint of short biography. His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane. The couple had three children: John Jr. (1964‚Äì1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), also a saxophonist. Biography =1926‚Äì1954: Early life and career= Coltrane's first recordings were made when he was a sailor. Coltrane was born in his parents' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina, on September 23, 1926.DeVito et al., p. 1 His father was John R. ColtraneDeVito et al., p. 2 and his mother was Alice Blair.DeVito et al.\\\\, p. 3 He grew up in High Point, North Carolina and attended William Penn High School. Beginning in December 1938, his father, aunt, and grandparents died within a few months of each other, leaving him to be raised by his mother and a close cousin.Porter, pp. 15‚Äì17 In June 1943, he moved to Philadelphia. In September, his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto. He played clarinet and alto horn in a community band before beginning alto saxophone in high school. From early to mid-1945 he had his first professional work: a \\"cocktail lounge trio\\" with piano and guitar.DeVito et al., p. 5 To avoid being drafted by the Army, Coltrane enlisted in the Navy on August 6, 1945, the day the first U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Japan. He was trained as an apprentice seaman at Sampson Naval Training Station in upstate New York before he was shipped to Pearl Harbor, where he was stationed at Manana Barracks, the largest posting of African-American servicemen in the world. By the time he got to Hawaii in late 1945, the Navy was downsizing. Coltrane's musical talent was recognized, and he became one of the few Navy men to serve as a musician without having been granted musician's rating when he joined the Melody Masters, the base swing band. As the Melody Masters was an all-white band, however, Coltrane was treated merely as a guest performer to avoid alerting superior officers of his participation in the band. He continued to perform other duties when not playing with the band, including kitchen and security details. By the end of his service, he had assumed a leadership role in the band. His first recordings, an informal session in Hawaii with Navy musicians, occurred on July 13, 1946.DeVito et al., p. 367 He played alto saxophone on a selection of jazz standards and bebop tunes.DeVito et al., pp. 367‚Äì368 After being discharged from the Navy as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where he \\"plunged into the heady excitement of the new music and the blossoming bebop scene.\\" After touring with King Kolax, he joined a band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane's playing by his former Navy buddy, trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters. He studied jazz theory with guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole and continued under Sandole's tutelage through the early 1950s. Although he started on alto saxophone, he began playing tenor saxophone in 1947 with Eddie Vinson. Coltrane called this a time when \\"a wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk [Coleman Hawkins], and Ben [Webster] and Tab Smith were doing in the '40s that I didn't understand, but that I felt emotionally.\\" A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. \\"Hasaan was the clue to...the system that Trane uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane's melodic concept.\\" Coltrane became fanatical about practicing and developing his craft, practicing \\"25 hours a day\\" according to Jimmy Heath. Heath recalls an incident in a hotel in San Francisco when after a complaint was issued, Coltrane took the horn out of his mouth and practiced fingering for a full hour. Such was his dedication it was common for him to fall asleep with the horn still in his mouth or practice a single note for hours on end. An important moment in the progression of Coltrane's musical development occurred on June 5, 1945, when he saw Charlie Parker perform for the first time. In a DownBeat magazine article in 1960 he recalled, \\"the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes.\\" Parker became an idol, and they played together occasionally in the late 1940s. He was a member of groups led by Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges in the early to mid-1950s. =1955‚Äì1957: Miles and Monk period= In 1955, Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with guitarist Dennis Sandole when he received a call from trumpeter Miles Davis. Davis had been successful in the 40s, but his reputation and work had been damaged in part by heroin addiction; he was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the \\"First Great Quintet\\"‚Äîalong with Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane's growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for Prestige in 1956, resulted in the albums Cookin', Relaxin', Workin, and Steamin. The \\"First Great Quintet\\" disbanded due in part to Coltrane's heroin addiction. During the later part of 1957 Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk at New York's Five Spot Caf√©, and played in Monk's quartet (July‚ÄìDecember 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many albums for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label. A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as Live at the Five Spot‚ÄîDiscovery! in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was also found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by Voice of America, the performances confirm the group's reputation, and the resulting album, Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall, is widely acclaimed. Blue Train, Coltrane's sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Paul Chambers, and trombonist Curtis Fuller, is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, \\"Moment's Notice\\", and \\"Lazy Bird\\", have become standards. Both tunes employed the first examples of his chord substitution cycles known as Coltrane changes. =1958: Davis and Coltrane= Coltrane rejoined Davis in January 1958. In October of that year, jazz critic Ira Gitler coined the term \\"sheets of sound\\" to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis's group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in hundreds of notes per minute. Coltrane recalled: \\"I found that there were a certain number of chord progressions to play in a given time, and sometimes what I played didn't work out in eighth notes, sixteenth notes, or triplets. I had to put the notes in uneven groups like fives and sevens in order to get them all in.\\" Coltrane stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley; pianists Red Garland, Bill Evans, and Wynton Kelly; bassist Paul Chambers; and drummers Philly Joe Jones and Jimmy Cobb. During this time he participated in the Davis sessions Milestones and Kind of Blue, and the concert recordings Miles & Monk at Newport (1963) and Jazz at the Plaza (1958). =1959‚Äì1961: Period with Atlantic Records= At the end of this period Coltrane recorded Giant Steps (1959), his first album as leader for Atlantic which contained only his compositions. The album's title track is generally considered to have one of the most difficult chord progressions of any widely played jazz composition. Its altered chord progression cycles came to be known as Coltrane changes. His development of these cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he continued throughout his career. {border=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right; font-size:100%; color:black; width:130px;\\" } Coltrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City. After moving through different personnel, including Steve Kuhn, Pete La Roca, and Billy Higgins, he kept pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Steve Davis, and drummer Elvin Jones. Tyner, a native of Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane for some years, and the two men had an understanding that Tyner would join the band when he felt ready. My Favorite Things (1961) was the first album recorded by this band. It was Coltrane's first album on soprano saxophone, which he began practicing while with Miles Davis. It was considered an unconventional move because the instrument was not as popular in jazz as other types of saxophone. =1961‚Äì1962: First years with Impulse Records= Coltrane in Amsterdam, 1961) In May 1961, Coltrane's contract with Atlantic was bought by Impulse!. The move to Impulse! meant that Coltrane resumed his recording relationship with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had recorded his and Davis's sessions for Prestige. He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder's studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. By early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by Reggie Workman, while Eric Dolphy joined the group as a second horn. The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the Village Vanguard, which demonstrated Coltrane's new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian ragas, modal jazz, and free jazz. John Gilmore, a longtime saxophonist with musician Sun Ra, was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, \\"He's got it! Gilmore's got the concept!\\" The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues \\"Chasin' the 'Trane\\", was strongly inspired by Gilmore's music. Starting in 1961, Coltrane also began pairing Workman with a second bassist, usually Art Davis or Donald Garrett. Garrett recalled playing a tape for Coltrane where \\"...I was playing with another bass player. We were doing some things rhythmically, and Coltrane became excited about the sound. We got the same kind of sound you get from the East Indian water drum. One bass remains in the lower register and is the stabilizing, pulsating thing, while the other bass is free to improvise, like the right hand would be on the drum. So Coltrane liked the idea.\\" Coltrane also recalled: \\"I thought another bass would add that certain rhythmic sound. We were playing a lot of stuff with a sort of suspended rhythm, with one bass playing a series of notes around one point, and it seemed that another bass could fill in the spaces...\\" According to Eric Dolphy, one night \\"Wilbur Ware came in and up on the stand so they had three basses going. John and I got off the stand and listened...\\" Coltrane employed two basses on the 1961 albums Ol√© Coltrane and Africa/Brass, and later on The John Coltrane Quartet Plays and Ascension. During this period, critics were divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style. Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, Down Beat magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of \\"anti-jazz\\" in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians. Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy's angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the \\"New Thing\\", also known as free jazz, a movement led by Ornette Coleman which was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane's style developed, he was determined to make every performance \\"a whole expression of one's being\\".Nisenson, p. 179 =1962‚Äì1965: Classic Quartet period= In 1962, Dolphy departed and Jimmy Garrison replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the \\"Classic Quartet\\", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his \\"standards\\": \\"Impressions\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", and \\"I Want to Talk About You\\". The criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of Coltrane, 1962, which featured a blistering version of Harold Arlen's \\"Out of This World\\") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with Duke Ellington and singer Johnny Hartman, a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album Ballads (recorded 1961‚Äì62) is emblematic of Coltrane's versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as \\"It's Easy to Remember\\". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance \\"standards\\" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the Impressions (recorded 1961‚Äì63), Live at Birdland and Newport '63 (both recorded 1963). Impressions consists of two extended jams including the title track along with \\"Dear Old Stockholm\\", \\"After the Rain\\" and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a \\"balanced catalogue.\\" On March 6, 1963, the group entered Van Gelder Studio in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse Records to cut down on storage space. On June 29, 2018, Impulse! released Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album, made up of seven tracks made from a spare copy Coltrane had given to his wife. On March 7, 1963, they were joined in the studio by Hartman for the recording of six tracks for the John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album, released that July. Impulse! followed the successful \\"lost album\\" release with 2019's Blue World, made up of a 1964 soundtrack to the film The Cat in the Bag, recorded in June 1964. The Classic Quartet produced their best-selling album, A Love Supreme, in December 1964. A culmination of much of Coltrane's work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane's composing and playing from this point onwards‚Äîas can be seen from album titles such as Ascension, Om and Meditations. The fourth movement of A Love Supreme, \\"Psalm\\", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album's liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at Coltrane's home in Dix Hills on Long Island. The quartet played A Love Supreme live only once‚Äîin July 1965 at a concert in Antibes, France. A recording of this concert was released by Impulse! in 2002 on the remastered Deluxe Edition of A Love Supreme, and again in 2015 on the \\"Super Deluxe Edition\\" of The Complete Masters. =1965: Avant-garde jazz and the second quartet= As Coltrane's interest in jazz became experimental, he added Pharoah Sanders (center; circa 1978) to his ensemble. In his late period, Coltrane showed an interest in the avant-garde jazz of Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Sun Ra. He was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock, who had worked with Paul Bley, and drummer Sunny Murray, whose playing was honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. Coltrane championed many young free jazz musicians such as Archie Shepp, and under his influence Impulse! became a leading free jazz label. After A Love Supreme was recorded, Ayler's style became more prominent in Coltrane's music. A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, use of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the albums The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Living Space, Transition, New Thing at Newport, Sun Ship, and First Meditations. In June 1965, he went into Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Marion Brown, and John Tchicai) to record Ascension, a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians. The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used overblowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders \\"was involved in the search for 'human' sounds on his instrument,\\" employing \\"a tone which blasted like a blow torch\\" and drastically expanding the vocabulary of his horn by employing multiphonics, growling, and \\"high register squeals [that] could imitate not only the human song but the human cry and shriek as well.\\" Regarding Coltrane's decision to add Sanders to the band, Gary Giddins wrote \\"Those who had followed Coltrane to the edge of the galaxy now had the added challenge of a player who appeared to have little contact with earth.\\" =1965‚Äì1967: Adding to the quartet= Percussionist Rashied Ali (pictured in 2007) augmented Coltrane's sound. By late 1965, Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. Rashied Ali joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of Meditations. Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali. After Coltrane's death, Tyner and Jones in interviews expressed displeasure with the music's direction, while incorporating some of the free-jazz form's intensity in their solo work. There is speculation that in 1965 Coltrane began using LSD,Porter, pp. 265‚Äì266. informing the \\"cosmic\\" transcendence of his late period. After the departure of Tyner and Jones, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife Alice Coltrane on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums. Coltrane and Sanders were described by Nat Hentoff as \\"speaking in tongues\\". When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes. The group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including Live at the Village Vanguard Again! and Live in Japan. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual \\"To Be\\" has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (Expression and Stellar Regions) or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album Interstellar Space. =1967: Death= Coltrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. His funeral was held four days later at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City. The service was started by the Albert Ayler Quartet and finished by the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Coltrane is buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York. Biographer Lewis Porter speculated that the cause of Coltrane's illness was hepatitis, although he also attributed the disease to Coltrane's heroin use at a previous period in his life.Porter, p. 292 Coltrane's death surprised many in the music community who were unaware of his condition. Miles Davis said, \\"Coltrane's death shocked everyone, took everyone by surprise. I knew he hadn't looked too good... But I didn't know he was that sick‚Äîor even sick at all.\\"Porter, p. 290 Instruments In 1947, when he joined King Kolax's band, Coltrane switched to tenor saxophone, the instrument he became known for playing. In the early 1960s, during his engagement with Atlantic, he played soprano saxophone. His preference for playing melody higher on the range of the tenor saxophone is attributed to his training on alto horn and clarinet. His \\"sound concept\\", manipulated in one's vocal tract, of the tenor was set higher than the normal range of the instrument.\\"Secret of John Coltrane's high notes revealed\\", Roger Highfield, The Telegraph, Sunday June 12, 2011 Coltrane also noted how his experience playing the soprano saxophone gradually affected his style on the tenor, stating \\"the soprano, by being this small instrument, I found that playing the lowest note on it was like playing... one of the middle notes in the tenor... I found that I would play all over this instrument... And on tenor, I hadn't always played all over it, because I was playing certain ideas which would just run in certain ranges... By playing on the soprano and becoming accustomed to playing from that low B-flat on up, it soon got so when I went to tenor, I found myself doing the same thing... And this caused... the willingness to change and just try to play... as much of the instrument as possible.\\" Toward the end of his career, he experimented with flute in his live performances and studio recordings (Live at the Village Vanguard Again!, Expression). After Eric Dolphy died in June 1964, his mother gave Coltrane his flute and bass clarinet. According to drummer Rashied Ali, Coltrane had an interest in the drums. He would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play. His interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as \\"Pursuance\\" and \\"The Drum Thing\\" from A Love Supreme and Crescent, respectively. It resulted in the album Interstellar Space with Ali. In an interview with Nat Hentoff in late 1965 or early 1966, Coltrane stated: \\"I feel the need for more time, more rhythm all around me. And with more than one drummer, the rhythm can be more multi-directional.\\" In an August 1966 interview with Frank Kofsky, Coltrane repeatedly emphasized his affinity for drums, saying \\"I feel so strongly about drums, I really do.\\" Later that year, Coltrane would record the music released posthumously on Offering: Live at Temple University, which features Ali on drums supplemented by three percussionists. Coltrane's tenor (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 125571, dated 1965) and soprano (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 99626, dated 1962) saxophones were auctioned on February 20, 2005 to raise money for the John Coltrane Foundation. Although he rarely played alto, he owned a prototype Yamaha alto saxophone given to him by the company as an endorsement in 1966. He can be heard playing it on live albums recorded in Japan, such as Second Night in Tokyo, and is pictured using it on the cover of the compilation Live in Japan. He can also be heard playing the Yamaha alto on the album Stellar Regions. Personal life and religious beliefs Coltrane was born and raised in a Christian home. He was influenced by religion and spirituality beginning in childhood. His maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was a minister at an African Methodist Episcopal Zion ChurchPorter, pp. 5-6Lavezzoli, p. 270 in High Point, North Carolina, and his paternal grandfather, the Reverend William H. Coltrane, was an A.M.E. Zion minister in Hamlet, North Carolina. Critic Norman Weinstein noted the parallel between Coltrane's music and his experience in the southern church, which included practicing music there as a youth. In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (n√©e Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, a Muslim convert, heavily influenced his spirituality. When they married, she had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Syeeda. Coltrane adopted Syeeda. He met Naima at the home of bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, \\"Naima\\", was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home at 116-60 Mexico Street in St. Albans, Queens. This is the house where they would break up in 1963. About the break up, Naima said in J. C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane, \\"I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year.\\" But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996. In 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addictionPorter, p. 61Lavezzoli, p. 271 and alcoholism he had struggled with since 1948.Lavezzoli, pp. 272‚Äì273 In the liner notes of A Love Supreme, Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced \\"by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\\" The liner notes appear to mention God in a Universalist sense and do not advocate one religion over another.John Coltrane's liner notes to A Love Supreme, December 1964 Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of Meditations (1965) in which Coltrane declares, \\"I believe in all religions.\\"Lavezzoli, p. 286 In 1963, he met pianist Alice McLeod.Lavezzoli, p. 281 He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became \\"officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.\\" John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (\\"Oran\\") in 1967. According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, \\"Alice brought happiness and stability to John's life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy. Alice also understood what it was like to be a professional musician.\\" After A Love Supreme, many of the titles of his songs and albums had spiritual connotations: Ascension, Meditations, Om, Selflessness, \\"Amen\\", \\"Ascent\\", \\"Attaining\\", \\"Dear Lord\\", \\"Prayer and Meditation Suite\\", and \\"The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost\\". His collection of books included The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, the Bhagavad Gita, and Paramahansa Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi. The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli's words, a \\"search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between Krishna and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the Qur'an, the Bible, Kabbalah, and astrology with equal sincerity.\\"Lavezzoli, pp. 280‚Äì281 He also explored Hinduism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, African history, the philosophical teachings of Plato and Aristotle, and Zen Buddhism.Lavezzoli, pp. 286‚Äì287 In October 1965, Coltrane recorded Om, referring to the sacred syllable in Hinduism, which symbolizes the infinite or the entire universe. Coltrane described Om as the \\"first syllable, the primal word, the word of power\\".Porter, p. 265 The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu Bhagavad GitaLavezzoli, p. 285: \\"Coltrane and one or two other musicians begin and end the piece by chanting in unison a verse from chapter nine (\\"The Yoga of Mysticism\\") of the Bhagavad Gita: Rites that the Vedas ordain, and the rituals taught by the scriptures: all these I am, and the offering made to the ghosts of the fathers, herbs of healing and food, the mantram, the clarified butter. I the oblation, and I the flame into which it is offered. I am the sire of the world, and this world's mother and grandsire. I am he who awards to each the fruit of his action. I make all things clean. I am Om!\\" and the Buddhist Tibetan Book of the Dead,Nisenson, p. 183 and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization \\"om\\" as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things. Coltrane's spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could \\"produce specific emotional meanings.\\" According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, \\"I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I'd like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he'd be broke, I'd bring out a different song and immediately he'd receive all the money he needed.\\"Porter, p. 211  Veneration  After Coltrane's death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in San Francisco began worshiping him as God incarnate. The group was named after Charlie Parker, whom they equated to John the Baptist. The congregation became affiliated with the African Orthodox Church; this involved changing Coltrane's status from a god to a saint. The resultant St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane's music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy. Rev. F. W. King, describing the African Orthodox Church of Saint John Coltrane, said \\"We are Coltrane-conscious...God dwells in the musical majesty of his sounds.\\" Samuel G. Freedman wrote in The New York Times that Coltrane is depicted as one of the 90 saints in the Dancing Saints icon of St. Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church in San Francisco. The icon is a painting in the Byzantine iconographic style that wraps around the entire church rotunda. It was executed by Mark Dukes, an ordained deacon at the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church who painted other icons of Coltrane for the Coltrane Church. Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey, included Coltrane on its list of historical black saints and made a \\"case for sainthood\\" for him in an article on its website. Documentaries about Coltrane and the church include Alan Klingenstein's The Church of Saint Coltrane (1996), and a 2004 program presented by Alan Yentob for the BBC.

Geography Mary River National Park incorporates the following areas, some of which are not contiguous to each other. The park consists of four non-contiguous parts: * Alligator Lagoon Conservation Area * Annaburroo Delta Block Conservation Area * Boggy Springs Conservation Area * Jimmy's Creek Conservation Area * Mary River Conservation Reserve * Mary River Crossing Conservation Area * McKinlay River Conservation Area * Opium Creek Conservation Area * Point Stuart Coastal Reserve * Shady Camp Conservation Area * Stuarts Tree Historical Reserve * Swim Creek Conservation Area * Wildman River Conservation Area Overview The Mary River National Park consists of a collection of small reserve areas which protects part of the Mary River catchment. The Mary River is one of eight rivers in the Top End that have large floodplains in their catchments. The Arnhem Highway crosses five of these eight rivers as one travels between Darwin and Jabiru. This Park is located 150 km east of Darwin along the Arnhem Highway. In the Dry Season, from May to September, most areas are accessible to all vehicles, however many roads are unsealed. During the Wet Season, from October to April, flooding can cause road closures. Recreational activities The Mary River Crossing on the Arnhem Highway 3 km west of the Bark Hut Inn has picnic areas, toilets and a boat ramp to make this an ideal site to access the Mary River system. Camping is not permitted at the Mary River Crossing. Rockhole is another popular access point to the waterways of the Mary River. A boat ramp and picnic facilities are located here, where Barramundi fishing is popular. Couzen's Lookout camping area offers secluded camping beside the Mary River. It is only a short walk to the lookout where the sunsets are stunning. Brian Creek Monsoon Forest is a patch of diverse monsoon forest that contrasts strongly with the surrounding woodlands.

The Soyuz spacecraft was originally part of a Moon landing project intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. It was the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the Vostok and Voskhod programmes. The programme consists of the Soyuz spacecraft and the Soyuz rocket and is now the responsibility of the Russian Roscosmos. Since the retirement of the American Space Shuttle in 2011, human spaceflights to and from the International Space Station have been carried out using Soyuz, until May 30, 2020, when the United States launched the SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 to the International Space Station, its first crewed launch from US soil since 2011. Soyuz rocket Soyuz rocket on launch pad. The launch vehicles used in the Soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center (TsSKB-Progress) in Samara, Russia. As well as being used in the Soyuz programme as the launcher for the crewed Soyuz spacecraft, Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch robotic Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the Starsem company. Currently Soyuz vehicles are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwest Russia and, since 2011, Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. The Spaceport's new Soyuz launch site has been handling Soyuz launches since 21 October 2011, the date of the first launch. As of December 2019, 19 Guiana Soyuz launches had been made from French Guiana Space Centre, all successful. Soyuz spacecraft The basic Soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects, many of which were never developed. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the Moon without employing a huge booster like the Saturn V or the Soviet N-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass. A Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back): *a spheroid orbital module *a small aerodynamic reentry module *a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached There have been many variants of the Soyuz spacecraft, including: * Soyuz-A 7K-9K-11K circumlunar complex proposal (1963)  Soyuz 7K crewed spacecraft concept  Soyuz 9K proposed booster  Soyuz 11K proposed fuel tanker * Soyuz 7K-OK (1967‚Äì1970)  Soyuz 7K-L1 Zond (1967‚Äì1970)  Soyuz 7K-L3 LOK (1971‚Äì1972) * Soyuz 7K-OKS (1971) * Soyuz 7K-T or \\"ferry\\" (1973‚Äì1981)  Soyuz 7K-T/A9 (1974‚Äì1978)  7K-MF6 (1976) * Soyuz 7K-TM (1974‚Äì1976) * Soyuz-T (1976‚Äì1986) * Soyuz-TM (1986‚Äì2003) * Soyuz-TMA (2003‚Äì2012) * Soyuz-ACTS (2006) * Soyuz-TMA-M (2010‚Äì2016) * Soyuz MS (since 2016) * Military Soyuz (P, PPK, R, 7K-VI Zvezda, and OIS)  Soyuz P crewed satellite interceptor proposal (1962)  Soyuz R command-reconnaissance spacecraft proposal (1962) * Soyuz 7K-TK (1966)  Soyuz PPK revised version of Soyuz P (1964)  Soyuz 7K-VI Zvezda space station proposal (1964)  Soyuz OIS (1967) * Soyuz OB-VI space station proposal (1967) * Soyuz 7K-S military transport proposal (1974) * Soyuz 7K-ST concept for Soyuz T and TM (1974) Derivatives The Zond spacecraft was designed to take a crew around the Moon, but never achieved the required degree of safety or political need.

Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal, the term terminal covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window. A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as command-line interfaces (CLI) and text user interface (TUI) applications. These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via telnet, ssh, or dial-up. On Unix-like operating systems, it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine. Terminals usually support a set of escape sequences for controlling color, cursor position, etc. Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards known as ECMA-48, ANSI X3.64 or ISO/IEC 6429. Local echo Terminal emulators may implement a local echo function, which may erroneously be named \\"half-duplex\\", or still slightly incorrectly \\"echoplex\\" (which is formally an error detection mechanism rather than an input display option). Line-at-a-time mode/Local editing Terminal emulators may implement local editing, also known as \\"line- at-a-time mode\\". This is also mistakenly referred to as \\"half-duplex\\". In this mode, the terminal emulator only sends complete lines of input to the host system. The user enters and edits a line, but it is held locally within the terminal emulator as it is being edited. It is not transmitted until the user signals its completion, usually with the key on the keyboard or a \\"send\\" button of some sort in the user interface. At that point, the entire line is transmitted. Line-at-a-time mode implies local echo, since otherwise the user will not be able to see the line as it is being edited and constructed. However, line-at-a-time mode is independent of echo mode and does not require local echo. When entering a password, for example, line-at-a-time entry with local editing is possible, but local echo is turned off (otherwise the password would be displayed). The complexities of line-at-a-time mode are exemplified by the line-at-a-time mode option in the telnet protocol. To implement it correctly, the Network Virtual Terminal implementation provided by the terminal emulator program must be capable of recognizing and properly dealing with \\"interrupt\\" and \\"abort\\" events that arrive in the middle of locally editing a line. Synchronous terminals In asynchronous terminals data can flow in any direction at any time. In synchronous terminals a protocol controls who may send data when. IBM 3270-based terminals used with IBM mainframe computers are an example of synchronous terminals. They operate in an essentially \\"screen-at-a-time\\" mode (also known as block mode). Users can make numerous changes to a page, before submitting the updated screen to the remote machine as a single action. Terminal emulators that simulate the 3270 protocol are available for most operating systems, for use both by those administering systems such as the z9, as well as those using the corresponding applications such as CICS. Other examples of synchronous terminals include the IBM 5250, ICL 7561, Honeywell Bull VIP7800 and Hewlett-Packard 700/92. Virtual consoles Virtual consoles, also called virtual terminals, are emulated text terminals, using the keyboard and monitor of a personal computer or workstation. The word \\"text\\" is key since virtual consoles are not GUI terminals and they do not run inside a graphical interface. Virtual consoles are found on all GNU/Linux systems, even on systems which don't have a desktop environment or graphical system installed. They are primarily used to access and interact with servers. Examples of terminals emulated Many terminal emulators have been developed for terminals such as VT52, VT100, VT220, VT320, IBM 3270/8/9/E, IBM 5250, IBM 3179G, Data General D211, Hewlett Packard HP700/92, Sperry/Unisys 2000-series UTS60, Burroughs/Unisys A-series T27/TD830/ET1100, ADDS ViewPoint, Sun console, QNX, AT386, SCO-ANSI, SNI 97801, Televideo, and Wyse 50/60. Additionally, programs have been developed to emulate other terminal emulators such as xterm and assorted console terminals (e.g., for Linux). Finally, some emulators simply refer to a standard, such as ANSI. Such programs are available on many platforms ranging from DOS and Unix to Windows and macOS to embedded operating systems found in cellphones and industrial hardware.

A number of hypotheses exist on many of the key issues regarding the domestication of the horse. Although horses appeared in Paleolithic cave art as early as 30,000 BCE, these were wild horses and were probably hunted for meat. How and when horses became domesticated is disputed. The clearest evidence of early use of the horse as a means of transport is from chariot burials dated c. 2000 BCE. However, an increasing amount of evidence supports the hypothesis that horses were domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes approximately 3500 BCE; recent discoveries in the context of the Botai culture suggest that Botai settlements in the Akmola Province of Kazakhstan are the location of the earliest domestication of the horse. Use of horses spread across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work, and warfare. Background The date of the domestication of the horse depends to some degree upon the definition of \\"domestication\\". Some zoologists define \\"domestication\\" as human control over breeding, which can be detected in ancient skeletal samples by changes in the size and variability of ancient horse populations. Other researchers look at the broader evidence, including skeletal and dental evidence of working activity; weapons, art, and spiritual artifacts; and lifestyle patterns of human cultures. There is also evidence that horses were kept as meat animals prior to being trained as working animals. Attempts to date domestication by genetic study or analysis of physical remains rests on the assumption that there was a separation of the genotypes of domesticated and wild populations. Such a separation appears to have taken place, but dates based on such methods can only produce an estimate of the latest possible date for domestication without excluding the possibility of an unknown period of earlier gene-flow between wild and domestic populations (which will occur naturally as long as the domesticated population is kept within the habitat of the wild population). Further, all modern horse populations retain the ability to revert to a feral state, and all feral horses are of domestic types; that is, they descend from ancestors that escaped from captivity. Whether one adopts the narrower zoological definition of domestication or the broader cultural definition that rests on an array of zoological and archaeological evidence affects the time frame chosen for domestication of the horse. The date of 4000 BCE is based on evidence that includes the appearance of dental pathologies associated with bitting, changes in butchering practices, changes in human economies and settlement patterns, the depiction of horses as symbols of power in artifacts, and the appearance of horse bones in human graves. On the other hand, measurable changes in size and increases in variability associated with domestication occurred later, about 2500‚Äì2000 BCE, as seen in horse remains found at the site of Csepel-Haros in Hungary, a settlement of the Bell Beaker culture. Use of horses spread across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare. Horses and mules in agriculture used a breastplate type harness or a yoke more suitable for oxen, which was not as efficient at utilizing the full strength of the animals as the later-invented padded horse collar that arose several millennia later. Predecessors to the domestic horse Replica of a horse painting from a cave in Lascaux A 2005 study analyzed the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a worldwide range of equids, from 53,000-year-old fossils to contemporary horses. Their analysis placed all equids into a single clade, or group with a single common ancestor, consisting of three genetically divergent species: Hippidion, the New World stilt-legged horse, and equus, the true horse. The true horse included prehistoric horses and the Przewalski's Horse, as well as what is now the modern domestic horse, belonged to a single Holarctic species. The true horse migrated from the Americas to Eurasia via Beringia, becoming broadly distributed from North America to central Europe, north and south of Pleistocene ice sheets. It became extinct in Beringia around 14,200 years ago, and in the rest of the Americas around 10,000 years ago. This clade survived in Eurasia, however, and it is from these horses which all domestic horses appear to have descended. These horses showed little phylogeographic structure, probably reflecting their high degree of mobility and adaptability. Therefore, the domestic horse today is classified as Equus ferus caballus. No genetic originals of native wild horses currently exist. The Przewalski diverged from the modern horse prior to domestication. It has 66 chromosomes, as opposed to 64 among modern domesticated horses, and their Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) forms a distinct cluster. Genetic evidence suggests that modern Przewalski's horses are descended from a distinct regional gene pool in the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes, not from the same genetic group that gave rise to modern domesticated horses. Nevertheless, evidence such as the cave paintings of Lascaux suggests that the ancient wild horses that some researchers now label the \\"Tarpan subtype\\" probably resembled Przewalski horses in their general appearance: big heads, dun coloration, thick necks, stiff upright manes, and relatively short, stout legs. Equus caballus germanicus front leg, teeth and upper jaw at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin The horses of the Ice Age were hunted for meat in Europe and across the Eurasian steppes and in North America by early modern humans. Numerous kill sites exist and many cave paintings in Europe indicate what they looked like. Many of these Ice Age subspecies died out during the rapid climate changes associated with the end of the last Ice Age or were hunted out by humans, particularly in North America, where the horse became completely extinct. Classification based on body types and conformation, absent the availability of DNA for research, once suggested that there were roughly four basic wild prototypes, thought to have developed with adaptations to their environment prior to domestication. There were competing theories: some argued that the four prototypes were separate species or subspecies, while others suggested that the prototypes were physically different manifestations of the same species. However, more recent study indicates that there was only one wild species and all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding or landrace adaptation after domestication. Either way, the most common theories of prototypes from which all modern breeds are thought to have developed suggests that in addition to the so-called Tarpan subtype, there were the following base prototypes: * The \\"Warmblood subspecies\\" or \\"Forest Horse\\" (once proposed as Equus ferus silvaticus, also known as the Diluvial Horse), which evolved into a later variety sometimes called Equus ferus germanicus. This prototype may have contributed to the development of the warmblood horses of northern Europe, as well as older \\"heavy horses\\" such as the Ardennais. * The \\"Draft\\" subspecies, a small, sturdy, heavyset animal with a heavy hair coat, arising in northern Europe, adapted to cold, damp climates, somewhat resembling today's draft horse and even the Shetland pony. * The \\"Oriental\\" subspecies (once proposed as Equus agilis), a taller, slim, refined and agile animal arising in Western Asia, adapted to hot, dry climates. It is thought to be the progenitor of the modern Arabian horse and Akhal-Teke. Only two never-domesticated \\"wild\\" groups survived into historic times, Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalski), and the Tarpan (Equus ferus ferus). The Tarpan became extinct in the late 19th century and Przewalski's horse is endangered; it became extinct in the wild during the 1960s, but was re-introduced in the late 1980s to two preserves in Mongolia. Although researchers such as Marija Gimbutas theorized that the horses of the Chalcolithic period were Przewalski's, more recent genetic studies indicate that Przewalski's horse is not an ancestor to modern domesticated horses. Other now-extinct subspecies of Equus ferus appears to have been the stock from which domesticated horses are descended. Genetic evidence The early stages of domestication were marked by a rapid increase in coat color variation. A 2014 study compared DNA from ancient horse bones that predated domestication and compared them to DNA of modern horses, discovering 125 genes that correlated to domestication. Some were physical, affecting muscle and limb development, cardiac strength and balance. Others were linked to cognitive function and most likely were critical to the taming of the horse, including social behavior, learning capabilities, fear response, and agreeableness. The DNA used in this study came from horse bones 16,000 to 43,000 years ago, and therefore the precise changes that occurred at the time of domestication have yet to be sequenced. The domestication of stallions and mares can be analyzed separately by looking at those portions of the DNA that are passed on exclusively along the maternal (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA) or paternal line (Y-chromosome or Y-DNA). DNA studies indicate that there may have been multiple domestication events for mares, as the number of female lines required to account for the genetic diversity of the modern horse suggests a minimum of 77 different ancestral mares, divided into 17 distinct lineages. On the other hand, genetic evidence with regard to the domestication of stallions points at a single domestication event for a limited number of stallions combined with repeated restocking of wild females into the domesticated herds. A study published in 2012 that performed genomic sampling on 300 work horses from local areas as well as a review of previous studies of archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-DNA suggested that horses were originally domesticated in the western part of the Eurasian steppe. Both domesticated stallions and mares spread out from this area, and then additional wild mares were added from local herds; wild mares were easier to handle than wild stallions. Most other parts of the world were ruled out as sites for horse domestication, either due to climate unsuitable for an indigenous wild horse population or no evidence of domestication.Lest√©- Lasserre,Christa. Researchers: Horses First Domesticated in Western Steppes, The Horse 13 June 2012, Article # 20162 Genes located on the Y-chromosome are inherited only from sire to its male offspring and these lines show a very reduced degree of genetic variation (aka genetic homogeneity) in modern domestic horses, far less than expected based on the overall genetic variation in the remaining genetic material. This indicates that a relatively few stallions were domesticated and that it is unlikely that many male offspring originating from unions between wild stallions and domestic mares were included in early domesticated breeding stock. Genes located in the mitochondrial DNA are passed on along the maternal line from the mother to her offspring. Multiple analyses of the mitochondrial DNA obtained from modern horses as well as from horse bones and teeth from archaeological and palaeological finds consistently shows an increased genetic diversity in the mitochondrial DNA compared to the remaining DNA, showing that a large number of mares has been included into the breeding stock of the originally domesticated horse. Variation in the mitochondrial DNA is used to determine so-called haplogroups. A haplogroup is a group of closely related haplotypes that share the same common ancestor. In horses, seven main haplogroups are recognized (A-G), each with several subgroups. Several haplogroups are unequally distributed around the world, indicating the addition of local wild mares to the domesticated stock. One of these haplotypes (Lusitano group C) is exclusively found in the Iberian Peninsula, leading to a hypothesis that the Iberian peninsula or North Africa was an independent origin for domestication of the horse. However, until there is additional analysis of nuclear DNA and a better understanding of the genetic structure of the earliest domestic herds, this theory cannot be confirmed or refuted. It remains possible that a second, independent, domestication site might exist but, as of 2012, research has neither confirmed nor disproven that hypothesis. Even though horse domestication became widespread in a short period of time, it is still possible that domestication began with a single culture, which passed on techniques and breeding stock. It is possible that the two \\"wild\\" subspecies remained when all other groups of once-\\"wild\\" horses died out because all others had been, perhaps, more suitable for taming by humans and the selective breeding that gave rise to the modern domestic horse. Archaeological evidence Chariots of Ramesses II and the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh, 1274 BCE Archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from three kinds of sources: 1) changes in the skeletons and teeth of ancient horses; 2) changes in the geographic distribution of ancient horses, particularly the introduction of horses into regions where no wild horses had existed; and 3) archaeological sites containing artifacts, images, or evidence of changes in human behavior connected with horses. Examples include horse remains interred in human graves; changes in the ages and sexes of the horses killed by humans; the appearance of horse corrals; equipment such as bits or other types of horse tack; horses interred with equipment intended for use by horses, such as chariots; and depictions of horses used for riding, driving, draught work, or symbols of human power. Few of these categories, taken alone, provide irrefutable evidence of domestication, but the cumulative evidence becomes increasingly more persuasive. =Horses interred with chariots= Horse-drawn chariot carved in the Airavatesvara Temple in Darasuram The least ancient, but most persuasive, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse leg bones and skulls, probably originally attached to hides, were interred with the remains of chariots in at least 16 graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures. These were located in the steppes southeast of the Ural Mountains, between the upper Ural and upper Tobol Rivers, a region today divided between southern Russia and northern Kazakhstan. Petrovka was a little later than and probably grew out of Sintashta, and the two complexes together spanned about 2100‚Äì1700 BCE. A few of these graves contained the remains of as many as eight sacrificed horses placed in, above, and beside the grave. In all of the dated chariot graves, the heads and hooves of a pair of horses were placed in a grave that once contained a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2‚Äì1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition, a pair of disk-shaped antler \\"cheekpieces,\\" an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse's lips when the reins were pulled on the opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots. All of the dated chariot graves contained wheel impressions, horse bones, weapons (arrow and javelin points, axes, daggers, or stone mace-heads), human skeletal remains, and cheekpieces. Because they were buried in teams of two with chariots and studded cheekpieces, the evidence is extremely persuasive that these steppe horses of 2100‚Äì1700 BCE were domesticated. Shortly after the period of these burials, the expansion of the domestic horse throughout Europe was little short of explosive. In the space of possibly 500 years, there is evidence of horse-drawn chariots in Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. By another 500 years, the horse-drawn chariot had spread to China. =Skeletal indicators of domestication= Some researchers do not consider an animal to be \\"domesticated\\" until it exhibits physical changes consistent with selective breeding, or at least having been born and raised entirely in captivity. Until that point, they classify captive animals as merely \\"tamed\\". Those who hold to this theory of domestication point to a change in skeletal measurements detected among horse bones recovered from middens dated about 2500 BCE in eastern Hungary in Bell-Beaker sites, and in later Bronze Age sites in the Russian steppes, Spain, and Eastern Europe. Horse bones from these contexts exhibited an increase in variability, thought to reflect the survival under human care of both larger and smaller individuals than appeared in the wild; and a decrease in average size, thought to reflect penning and restriction in diet. Horse populations that showed this combination of skeletal changes probably were domesticated. Most evidence suggests that horses were increasingly controlled by humans after about 2500 BCE. However, more recently there have been skeletal remains found at a site in Kazakhstan which display the smaller, more slender limbs characteristic of corralled animals, dated to 3500 BCE. =Botai culture= Some of the most intriguing evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers who seem to have adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500‚Äì3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50‚Äì150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones. Entire herds of horses were slaughtered by the Botai hunters, apparently in hunting drives. The adoption of horseback riding might explain the emergence of specialized horse-hunting techniques and larger, more permanent settlements. Domesticated horses could have been adopted from neighboring herding societies in the steppes west of the Ural Mountains, where the Khvalynsk culture had herds of cattle and sheep, and perhaps had domesticated horses, as early as 4800 BCE. Other researchers have argued that all of the Botai horses were wild, and that the horse-hunters of Botai hunted wild horses on foot. As evidence, they note that zoologists have found no skeletal changes in the Botai horses that indicate domestication. Moreover, because they were hunted for food, the majority of the horse remains found in Botai-culture settlements indeed probably were wild. On the other hand, any domesticated riding horses were probably the same size as their wild cousins and cannot now be distinguished by bone measurements. They also note that the age structure of the horses slaughtered at Botai represents a natural demographic profile for hunted animals, not the pattern expected if they were domesticated and selected for slaughter. However, these arguments were published prior to the discovery of a corral at Krasnyi Yar and mats of horse-dung at two other Botai sites. A study in 2018 revealed that the Botai horses did not contribute significantly to the genetics of modern domesticated horses, and that therefore a subsequent and separate domestication event must have been responsible for the modern domestic horse.Outram, Alan (2018) Origins of Horse Domestication: Botai, Yamnaya, Sintashta. Survive the Jive =Bit wear= A Luristan bronze horse bit The presence of bit wear is an indicator that a horse was ridden or driven, and the earliest of such evidence from a site in Kazakhstan dates to 3500 BCE. The absence of bit wear on horse teeth is not conclusive evidence against domestication because horses can be ridden and controlled without bits by using a noseband or a hackamore, but such materials do not produce significant physiological changes nor are they apt to be preserved for millennia. The regular use of a bit to control a horse can create wear facets or bevels on the anterior corners of the lower second premolars. The corners of the horse's mouth normally keep the bit on the \\"bars\\" of the mouth, an interdental space where there are no teeth, forward of the premolars. The bit must be manipulated by a human or the horse must move it with its tongue for it to touch the teeth. Wear can be caused by the bit abrading the front corners of the premolars if the horse grasps and releases the bit between its teeth; other wear can be created by the bit striking the vertical front edge of the lower premolars, due to very strong pressure from a human handler. Modern experiments showed that even organic bits of rope or leather can create significant wear facets, and also showed that facets 3mm (.118 in) deep or more do not appear on the premolars of wild horses. However, other researchers disputed both conclusions. Wear facets of 3 mm or more were found on seven horse premolars in two sites of the Botai culture, Botai and Kozhai 1, dated about 3500‚Äì3000 BCE. The Botai culture premolars are the earliest reported multiple examples of this dental pathology in any archaeological site, and preceded any skeletal change indicators by 1,000 years. While wear facets more than 3 mm deep were discovered on the lower second premolars of a single stallion from Dereivka in Ukraine, an Eneolithic settlement dated about 4000 BCE, dental material from one of the worn teeth later produced a radiocarbon date of 700‚Äì200 BCE, indicating that this stallion was actually deposited in a pit dug into the older Eneolithic site during the Iron Age. =Dung and corrals= Soil scientists working with Sandra Olsen of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History at the Chalcolithic (also called Eneolithic, or \\"Copper Age\\") settlements of Botai and Krasnyi Yar in northern Kazakhstan found layers of horse dung, discarded in unused house pits in both settlements. The collection and disposal of horse dung suggests that horses were confined in corrals or stables. An actual corral, dated to 3500‚Äì3000 BCE was identified at Krasnyi Yar by a pattern of post holes for a circular fence, with the soils inside the fence yielding ten times more phosphorus than the soils outside. The phosphorus could represent the remains of manure. =Geographic expansion= The appearance of horse remains in human settlements in regions where they had not previously been present is another indicator of domestication. Although images of horses appear as early as the Upper Paleolithic period in places such as the caves of Lascaux, France, suggesting that wild horses lived in regions outside of the Eurasian steppes prior to domestication and may have even been hunted by early humans, concentration of remains suggests animals being deliberately captured and contained, an indicator of domestication, at least for food, if not necessarily use as a working animal. Around 3500‚Äì3000 BCE, horse bones began to appear more frequently in archaeological sites beyond their center of distribution in the Eurasian steppes and were seen in central Europe, the middle and lower Danube valley, and the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Evidence of horses in these areas had been rare before, and as numbers increased, larger animals also began to appear in horse remains. This expansion in range was contemporary with the Botai culture, where there are indications that horses were corralled and ridden. This does not necessarily mean that horses were first domesticated in the steppes, but the horse-hunters of the steppes certainly pursued wild horses more than in any other region. This geographic expansion is interpreted by many zoologists as an early phase in the spread of domesticated horses. European wild horses were hunted for up to 10% of the animal bones in a handful of Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements scattered across Spain, France, and the marshlands of northern Germany, but in many other parts of Europe, including Greece, the Balkans, the British Isles, and much of central Europe, horse bones do not occur or occur very rarely in Mesolithic, Neolithic or Chalcolithic sites. In contrast, wild horse bones regularly exceeded 40% of the identified animal bones in Mesolithic and Neolithic camps in the Eurasian steppes, west of the Ural Mountains. Horse bones were rare or absent in Neolithic and Chalcolithic kitchen garbage in western Turkey, Mesopotamia, most of Iran, South and Central Asia, and much of Europe. While horse bones have been identified in Neolithic sites in central Turkey, all equids together totaled less than 3% of the animal bones. Within this three percent, horses were less than 10%, with 90% or more of the equids represented by onagers (Equus hemionus) or another ass-like equid that later became extinct, Equus hydruntinus. Onagers were the most common native wild equids of the Near East. They were hunted in Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia; and domesticated asses (Equus asinus) were imported into Mesopotamia, probably from Egypt, but wild horses apparently did not live there. Other evidence of geographic expansion In Northern Caucasus, the Maikop culture settlements and burials of c. 3300 BC contain both horse bones and images of horses. A frieze of nineteen horses painted in black and red colors is found in one of the Maikop graves. The widespread appearance of horse bones and images in Maikop sites suggest to some observers that horseback riding began in the Maikop period.David W. Anthony, The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World. Princeton University Press, 2010 p291 Later, images of horses, identified by their short ears, flowing manes, and tails that bushed out at the dock, began to appear in artistic media in Mesopotamia during the Akkadian period, 2300‚Äì2100 BCE. The word for \\"horse\\", literally translated as ass of the mountains, first appeared in Sumerian documents during the Third dynasty of Ur, about 2100‚Äì2000 BCE. The kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur apparently fed horses to lions for royal entertainment, perhaps indicating that horses were still regarded as more exotic than useful, but King Shulgi, about 2050 BCE, compared himself to \\"a horse of the highway that swishes its tail\\", and one image from his reign showed a man apparently riding a horse at full gallop. Horses were imported into Mesopotamia and the lowland Near East in larger numbers after 2000 BCE in connection with the beginning of chariot warfare. A further expansion, into the lowland Near East and northwestern China, also happened around 2000 BCE, again apparently in conjunction with the chariot. Although Equus bones of uncertain species are found in some Late Neolithic sites in China dated before 2000 BCE, Equus caballus or Equus ferus bones first appeared in multiple sites and in significant numbers in sites of the Qijia and Siba cultures, 2000‚Äì1600 BCE, in Gansu and the northwestern provinces of China. The Qijia culture was in contact with cultures of the Eurasian steppes, as shown through similarities between Qijia and Late Bronze Age steppe metallurgy, so it was probably through these contacts that domesticated horses first became frequent in northwestern China. In 2008, archaeologists announced the discovery of rock art in Somalia's northern Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest is one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE. =Horse images as symbols of power= About 4200-4000 BCE, more than 500 years before the geographic expansion evidenced by the presence of horse bones, new kinds of graves, named after a grave at Suvorovo, appeared north of the Danube delta in the coastal steppes of Ukraine near Izmail. Suvorovo graves were similar to and probably derived from earlier funeral traditions in the steppes around the Dnieper River. Some Suvorovo graves contained polished stone mace-heads shaped like horse heads and horse tooth beads. Earlier steppe graves also had contained polished stone mace-heads, some of them carved in the shape of animal heads. Settlements in the steppes contemporary with Suvorovo, such as Sredni Stog II and Dereivka on the Dnieper River, contained 12‚Äì52% horse bones. When Suvorovo graves appeared in the Danube delta grasslands, horse- head maces also appeared in some of the indigenous farming towns of the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa cultures in present-day Romania and Moldova, near the Suvorovo graves. These agricultural cultures had not previously used polished- stone maces, and horse bones were rare or absent in their settlement sites. Probably their horse-head maces came from the Suvorovo immigrants. The Suvorovo people in turn acquired many copper ornaments from the Tripolye and Gumelnitsa towns. After this episode of contact and trade, but still during the period 4200‚Äì4000 BCE, about 600 agricultural towns in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley, some of which had been occupied for 2000 years, were abandoned. Copper mining ceased in the Balkan copper mines, and the cultural traditions associated with the agricultural towns were terminated in the Balkans and the lower Danube valley. This collapse of \\"Old Europe\\" has been attributed to the immigration of mounted Indo-European warriors. The collapse could have been caused by intensified warfare, for which there is some evidence; and warfare could have been worsened by mounted raiding; and the horse-head maces have been interpreted as indicating the introduction of domesticated horses and riding just before the collapse. However, mounted raiding is just one possible explanation for this complex event. Environmental deterioration, ecological degradation from millennia of farming, and the exhaustion of easily mined oxide copper ores also are cited as causal factors. =Artifacts= Perforated antler objects discovered at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo have been identified as cheekpieces or psalia for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide thongs, and rawhide thongs might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the thongs were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack‚Äîbits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear‚Äîare the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites. =Horses interred in human graves= The oldest possible archaeological indicator of a changed relationship between horses and humans is the appearance about 4800‚Äì4400 BCE of horse bones and carved images of horses in Chalcolithic graves of the early Khvalynsk culture and the Samara culture in the middle Volga region of Russia. At the Khvalynsk cemetery near the town of Khvalynsk, 158 graves of this period were excavated. Of these, 26 graves contained parts of sacrificed domestic animals, and additional sacrifices occurred in ritual deposits on the original ground surface above the graves. Ten graves contained parts of lower horse legs; two of these also contained the bones of domesticated cattle and sheep. At least 52 domesticated sheep or goats, 23 domesticated cattle, and 11 horses were sacrificed at Khvalynsk. The inclusion of horses with cattle and sheep and the exclusion of obviously wild animals together suggest that horses were categorized symbolically with domesticated animals. At S'yezzhe, a contemporary cemetery of the Samara culture, parts of two horses were placed above a group of human graves. The pair of horses here was represented by the head and hooves, probably originally attached to hides. The same ritual‚Äîusing the hide with the head and lower leg bones as a symbol for the whole animal‚Äîwas used for many domesticated cattle and sheep sacrifices at Khvalynsk. Horse images carved from bone were placed in the above-ground ochre deposit at S‚Äôyezzhe and occurred at several other sites of the same period in the middle and lower Volga region. Together these archaeological clues suggest that horses had a symbolic importance in the Khvalynsk and Samara cultures that they had lacked earlier, and that they were associated with humans, domesticated cattle, and domesticated sheep. Thus, the earliest phase in the domestication of the horse might have begun during the period 4800-4400 BCE. Methods of domestication Equidae died out in the Western Hemisphere at the end of the last glacial period. A question raised is why and how horses avoided this fate on the Eurasian continent. It has been theorized that domestication saved the species. While the environmental conditions for equine survival in Europe were somewhat more favorable in Eurasia than in the Americas, the same stressors that led to extinction for the Mammoth had an effect upon horse populations. Thus, some time after 8000 BCE, the approximate date of extinction in the Americas, humans in Eurasia may have begun to keep horses as a livestock food source, and by keeping them in captivity, may have helped to preserve the species. Horses also fit the six core criteria for livestock domestication, and thus, it could be argued, \\"chose\\" to live in close proximity to humans. One model of horse domestication starts with individual foals being kept as pets while the adult horses were slaughtered for meat. Foals are relatively small and easy to handle. Horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. Both historic and modern data shows that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals to meet their social needs. Thus domestication may have started with young horses being repeatedly made into pets over time, preceding the great discovery that these pets could be ridden or otherwise put to work. However, there is disagreement over the definition of the term domestication. One interpretation of domestication is that it must include physiological changes associated with being selectively bred in captivity, and not merely \\"tamed.\\" It has been noted that traditional peoples worldwide (both hunter-gatherers and horticulturists) routinely tame individuals from wild species, typically by hand-rearing infants whose parents have been killed, and these animals are not necessarily \\"domesticated.\\" On the other hand, some researchers look to examples from historical times to hypothesize how domestication occurred. For example, while Native American cultures captured and rode horses from the 16th century onwards, most tribes did not exert significant control over their breeding, thus their horses developed a genotype and phenotype adapted to the uses and climatological conditions in which they were kept, making them more of a landrace than a planned breed as defined by modern standards, but nonetheless \\"domesticated\\". Driving versus riding A difficult question is if domesticated horses were first ridden or driven. While the most unequivocal evidence shows horses first being used to pull chariots in warfare, there is strong, though indirect, evidence for riding occurring first, particularly by the Botai. Bit wear may correlate to riding, though, as the modern hackamore demonstrates, horses can be ridden without a bit by using rope and other evanescent materials to make equipment that fastens around the nose. So the absence of unequivocal evidence of early riding in the record does not settle the question. Thus, on one hand, logic suggests that horses would have been ridden long before they were driven. But it is also far more difficult to gather evidence of this, as the materials required for riding‚Äîsimple hackamores or blankets‚Äîwould not survive as artifacts, and other than tooth wear from a bit, the skeletal changes in an animal that was ridden would not necessarily be particularly noticeable. Direct evidence of horses being driven is much stronger. On the other hand, others argue that evidence of bit wear does not necessarily correlate to riding. Some theorists speculate that a horse could have been controlled from the ground by placing a bit in the mouth, connected to a lead rope, and leading the animal while pulling a primitive wagon or plow. Since oxen were usually relegated to this duty in Mesopotamia, it is possible that early plows might have been attempted with the horse, and a bit may indeed have been significant as part of agrarian development rather than as warfare technology. Horses in historic warfare Depiction of a mounted warrior from the Pazyryk burials, c. 300 BCE While riding may have been practiced during the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE, and the disappearance of \\"Old European\\" settlements may be related to attacks by horseback-mounted warriors, the clearest influence by horses on ancient warfare was by pulling chariots, introduced around 2000 BCE. Horses in the Bronze Age were relatively small by modern standards, which led some theorists to believe the ancient horses were too small to be ridden and so must have been driven. Herodotus' description of the Sigynnae, a steppe people who bred horses too small to ride but extremely efficient at drawing chariots, illustrates this stage. However, as horses remained generally smaller than modern equines well into the Middle Ages, this theory is highly questionable. The Iron Age in Mesopotamia saw the rise of mounted cavalry as a tool of war, as evidenced by the notable successes of mounted archer tactics used by various invading equestrian nomads such as the Parthians. Over time, the chariot gradually became obsolete. The horse of the Iron Age was still relatively small, perhaps high (measured at the withers.) This was shorter overall than the average height of modern riding horses, which range from about . However, small horses were used successfully as light cavalry for many centuries. For example, Fell ponies, believed to be descended from Roman cavalry horses, are comfortably able to carry fully grown adults (although with rather limited ground clearance) at an average height of Likewise, the Arabian horse is noted for a short back and dense bone, and the successes of the Muslims against the heavy mounted knights of Europe demonstrated that a horse standing can easily carry a full-grown human adult into battle. Mounted warriors such as the Scythians, Huns and Vandals of late Roman antiquity, the Mongols who invaded eastern Europe in the 7th century through 14th centuries CE, the Middle Eastern warriors of the 8th through 14th centuries CE, and the American Indians in the 16th through 19th centuries each demonstrated effective forms of light cavalry.

For example, when memorizing the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a story about a \\"dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky thirteen black cat playing with yarn by the window\\". It is argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself. Another method is to actually link each element of the list with a mental picture of an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. This would form an open doubly linked list which could be traversed at will, backwards or forwards. For example, in the last list one could imagine their dog inside of a giant envelope, then a black cat eating an envelope. The same logic would be used with the rest of the items. The observation that absurd images are easier to remember is known as the Von Restorff effect, although the success of this effect was refuted by several studies (Hock et al. 1978; Einstein 1987), which found that the established connection between the two words is more important than the image's absurdity. In order to access a certain element of the list, one needs to recite the list step by step, much in the same vein as a linked list, in order to get the element from the system. There are three limitations to the link system. The first is that there is no numerical order imposed when memorizing, hence the practitioner cannot immediately determine the numerical position of an item; this can be solved by bundling numerical markers at set points in the chain or using the peg system instead. The second is that if any of the items is forgotten, the entire list may be in jeopardy. The third is the potential for confusing repeated segments of the list, a common problem when memorizing binary digits. This limitation can be resolved either through bundling or by using either the peg system or the method of loci.Bremer, Rod.

It includes about 350 species and has members in all parts of the world. Most charadriiform birds live near water and eat invertebrates or other small animals; however, some are pelagic (seabirds), others frequent deserts, and a few are found in dense forest. Taxonomy, systematics and evolution The order was formerly divided into three suborders: * The waders (or \\"Charadrii\\"): typical shorebirds, most of which feed by probing in the mud or picking items off the surface in both coastal and freshwater environments. * The gulls and their allies (or \\"Lari\\"): these are generally larger species which take fish from the sea. Several gulls and skuas will also take food items from beaches, or rob smaller species, and some have become adapted to inland environments. * The auks (or \\"Alcae\\") are coastal species which nest on sea cliffs and \\"fly\\" underwater to catch fish. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy lumps all the Charadriiformes together with other seabirds and birds of prey into a greatly enlarged order Ciconiiformes. However, the resolution of the DNA-DNA hybridization technique used by Sibley & Ahlquist was not sufficient to properly resolve the relationships in this group, and indeed it appears as if the Charadriiformes constitute a single large and very distinctive lineage of modern birds of their own.Fain & Houde (2004) The auks, usually considered distinct because of their peculiar morphology, are more likely related to gulls, the \\"distinctness\\" being a result of adaptation for diving. Following recent research,Ericson et al. (2003), Paton et al. (2003), Thomas et al. (2004a,b), van Tuinen et al. (2004), Paton & Baker (2006) a better arrangement may be as follows: =Families in taxonomic order= This is a list of the charadriiform families, presented in taxonomic order. * Suborder Scolopaci: snipe-like waders  Family Scolopacidae: snipe, sandpipers, phalaropes, and allies * Suborder Thinocori: aberrant charadriforms  Family Rostratulidae: painted snipe  Family Jacanidae: jacanas  Family Thinocoridae: seedsnipe  Family Pedionomidae: plains wanderer * Suborder Lari: gulls and allies  Family Laridae: gulls, terns, and skimmers  Family Alcidae: puffins, guillemots, murres, and allies  Family Stercorariidae: skuas  Family Glareolidae: pratincoles and coursers  Family Pluvianidae: Egyptian plover  Family Dromadidae: crab plover * Suborder Turnici: buttonquails  Family Turnicidae: buttonquails * Suborder Chionidi: thick-knees and allies  Family Burhinidae: thick-knees  Family Chionididae: sheathbills  Family Pluvianellidae: Magellanic plover * Suborder Charadrii: plover-like waders  Family Ibidorhynchidae: ibisbill  Family Recurvirostridae: avocets and stilts  Family Haematopodidae: oystercatchers  Family Charadriidae: plovers and lapwings More conservatively, the Thinocori could be included in the Scolopaci (this combined sub-order is called Limicoli), and the Chionidi in the Charadrii. The suborders Thincori, Scolopaci, Chionidi, and Charadri are commonly referred to collectively as waders. Some taxonomy sources place the family Glareolidae in its own suborder, instead of being classified under suborder Lari. The buttonquails are of indeterminate or basal position in the Lari-Scolopaci sensu lato group. The arrangement as presented here is a consensus of the recent studies.van Tuinen et al.

(2016) =Evolution history= That the Charadriiformes are an ancient group is also borne out by the fossil record. Alongside the Anseriformes, the Charadriiformes are the only other order of modern bird to have an established fossil record within the late Cretaceous, alongside the other dinosaurs. Much of the Neornithes' fossil record around the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event is made up of bits and pieces of birds which resemble this order. In many, this is probably due to convergent evolution brought about by semiaquatic habits. Specimen VI 9901 (L√≥pez de Bertodano Formation, Late Cretaceous of Vega Island, Antarctica) is probably a basal charadriiform somewhat reminiscent of a thick-knee.Case, J. A. and C. P.

They therefore present an attractive set of examples to support the understanding of the evolution of parental care in avians generally (as reviewed in Thomas et al. 2007). The ancestral avian most likely had a female parental care system (Tullberg et al. 2002). The shorebird ancestor specifically evolved from a bi- parental care system, yet the species within the clade Scolopacidae evolved from a male parental care system. These transitions might have occurred for several reasons. Brooding density is correlated with male parental care. Male care systems in birds are shown to have a very low breeding density while female care systems in birds have a high breeding density. (Owens 2005). Certain rates of male and female mortality, male and female egg maturation rate, and egg death rate have been associated with particular systems as well (Klug et al. 2013). It has also been shown that sex role reversal is motivated by the male-biased adult sex ratio (Liker et al. 2013). The reason for such diversity in shorebirds, compared to other birds, has yet to be understood.

Founded in 1879 as Somerville Hall, it was one of the first two women's colleges in Oxford, and counts among its alumnae such major international figures as Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Dorothy Hodgkin, Iris Murdoch, Vera Brittain and Dorothy L. Sayers. The college started admitting men in 1994.History - Somerville College Somerville has one of the largest college libraries in Oxford and is known for its varied architecture and liberal atmosphere.Library & ITSomerville This character traces back to its foundation by social liberals as the first non-denominational college in Oxford, deliberately unlike the strictly Anglican Lady Margaret Hall, the other women's college opened in the same year. Somerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass and, in 1964, became one of the first colleges to abandon the policy of locking its gates at night to prevent students staying out late. No gowns are worn during Formal Halls. Somerville is one of only three Oxford colleges to provide on-site accommodation for all undergraduates throughout their course.Somerville College website The college is located near the Science Area, the University Parks, the Oxford University Press and Jericho, close to Green Templeton, St Anne's, Keble and St Benet's. Somerville is home to about 600 students, of which more than a third are international. Over half the UK students admitted to Somerville are educated at state schools, which is close to the university average. Its total net assets in 2018 were ¬£225.0 million, the seventh highest total for an Oxford undergraduate college. Its sister college in Cambridge is Girton College, Britain's first residential college for the education of women at degree level. History =Founding= In June 1878, the Association for the Higher Education of Women was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, Master of University College, T. H. Green, a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of Balliol College, and Edward Stuart Talbot, Warden of Keble College. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \\"Christ Church camp\\") founded Lady Margaret Hall, which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did. Thus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \\"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\\" This committee was called the \\"Balliol camp\\" and had close ties to the Liberal Party. This second committee included A. H. D. Acland, Thomas Hill Green, George William Kitchin, James Legge, Henry Nettleship, Walter Pater, Henry Francis Pelham, its chairman John Percival, Grace Prestwich, Eleanor Smith, A. G. Vernon Harcourt and Mary Ward. Other people who assisted in the founding were Anna Swanwick, Bertha Johnson, Charlotte Byron Green and Owen Roberts. This new effort resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer Mary Somerville. It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody. She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education. Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance. Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \\"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\\" Mary Somerville, 1780‚Äì1872, after whom the college is named =Women's college= When opened, Somerville Hall had twelve students, ranging in age between 17 and 36. The first 21 students from Somerville and Lady Margaret Hall attended lectures in rooms above a baker's shop on Little Clarendon Street. Just two of the original 12 students admitted in 1879 remained in Oxford for three years, the period of residence required for male students to complete a bachelor's degree. Increasingly, however, as the college admitted more students, it became more formalized. Somerville appointed Lilla Haigh as its first in-house tutor in 1882, and by the end of the 1890s female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges. In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College), the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build a library. In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \\"bluestocking college\\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement. In the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the women's suffrage campaign. In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees. From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew. In the same year the college was granted its charter. =First World War= During the First World War, Somerville College together with the Examination Schools and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the War Office to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to Oriel College. Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent St Mary Hall Quad which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students. Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the Western Front in France. Notable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon and R. E. Vern√®de. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford, Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it very much like Paradise. At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie. About his time at Somerville, he wrote: I enjoyed my stay at Somerville. The sun shone, and the discipline was easy. Alfred Mills was received in the hospital in 1916 and officer Llewelyn Davies died at the college. Once the war ended, the return to normality between Oriel and Somerville was delayed, sparking both frustration and an incident in spring 1919 known as the \\"Oriel raid\\", in which male students made a hole in the wall dividing the sexes. In July 1919 the principal (Emily Penrose) and fellows returned to Somerville. Alumna Vera Brittain wrote about the impact of the war in Oxford and paid tribute to the work of the principal, Miss Penrose, in her memoir Testament of Youth. =Admission of men= Starting in the 1970s, the traditionally all-male colleges in Oxford began to admit female students. Since it was assumed that recruiting from a wider demographic would guarantee better students, there was pressure on single-sex colleges to change their policy to avoid falling down the rankings. All-female colleges, like Somerville, found it increasingly difficult to attract good applicants and fell to the bottom of the intercollegiate academic rankings during the period. During the 1980s, there was much debate as to whether women's colleges should become mixed. Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994. Somerville became the second-to-last college (after St Hilda's) to become coeducational. A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford, Alice Prochaska, The Guardian, 15 May 2015 Buildings and grounds House seen from the Quad The college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of Woodstock Road, with Little Clarendon Street to the south, Walton Street to the west and the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter to the north. The front of the college runs between the Oxford Oratory and the Faculty of Philosophy. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest quads. Five buildings are Grade II-listed. A 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by Royalists during the Civil War. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well. =Walton House= House seen from the east The original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from St John's College in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes. The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year. In 1881, Sir Thomas Graham Jackson was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, Walter Cave added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House. Today House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by Roger Fry are located here. Most of the administration of college, and the academic pigeon-holes are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, George Romney and George Frederic Watts. =Park= Park Building Originally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by Newnham College, Cambridge. The building was designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built in two stages. The 1885‚Äì1887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left. This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals. The second building stage (1888‚Äì1894) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge. In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of Daphne Park, the principal from 1980 to 1989. Today there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room. Park is a Grade II-listed building. =Library= Somerville College Library The Grade II-listed library was designed by Basil Champneys in 1903 and opened by John Morley the following year. Specially for this opening, Demeter was written by Robert Bridges and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university. Amelia Edwards, John Stuart Mill, John Ruskin and Vera Brittain have been notable benefactors to the library. The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, John Constable, Maud Sumner and Patrick George. The John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books. The library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities. It has been given 100% satisfaction according to several annual student surveys. =Hall and Maitland= View of Hall and Maitland (right) from the quad Hall There was no hall large enough to seat the entire college until 1911, when Maitland Hall and Maitland, designed by Edmund Fisher in Queen Anne style and Edwardian Baroque, were opened by H. A. L. Fisher, the Vice-Chancellor of the University and Gilbert Murray. Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to Miss Maitland, the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of Mary Somerville by John Jackson. The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from University and Balliol Colleges for ¬£4,000 and ¬£1,400 respectively. There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, Morley Horder reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, Andr√© Gide gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside. Somerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women. They are painted by Michael Noakes, Herbert James Gunn, George Percy Jacomb-Hood, William Coldstream, John Whittall, Francis Helps, Claude Rogers, Humphrey Ocean, Thomas Leveritt and Richard Twose. Hall and Maitland form the east face of the main quad and are Grade II-listed buildings. The Senior Common Room is situated on the ground floor. The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time. Maitland now houses few students, being mainly occupied by fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall. =Penrose= The Penrose block was designed by Harold Rogers in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 for the construction to take place at the south-western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street. It was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named after Dame Emily Penrose, the third principal of the college. It contains mainly first-year accommodation, with around 30 rooms. =Darbishire= Darbishire Quad Darbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of St Giles' Church, Oxford, for the sum of ¬£1,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining Waggon and Horses pub was purchased from St John's College, in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House. Morley Horder was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of ¬£12,000 from Christ Church. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows. The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder John Percival, first principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938. Originally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by Lord Halifax, who called it \\"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\\" (varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile) in the Creweian Oration during the Encaenia. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, Helen Darbishire. Today Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room. The offices of the Global Ocean Commission, co-chaired by Jos√© Mar√≠a Figueres, Trevor Manuel and David Miliband, were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work. Darbishire Quad is described on the opening page of Gaudy Night by alumna Dorothy L. Sayers. The clock was donated by alumna Eleanor Rathbone. =Chapel= Somerville College Chapel with Vaughan on the right Built largely with funds provided by alumna Emily Georgiana Kemp in 1935, Somerville Chapel reflects the non-denominational principle on which the college was founded in 1879. No religious tests were used for admission and non-denominational Christian prayers were said in college.A House of Prayer for all Peoples? The Unique Case of Somerville College Chapel, Oxford 5 March 2018 Instead of a chaplain, there is a \\"Chapel Director\\" which is in keeping with its undenominational tradition. The chapel provides opportunities for Christian worship in addition to hosting speakers with a multi-faith range of religious perspectives. The chapel also has an excellent mixed-voice choir, the Choir of Somerville College, which tours and produces occasional CDs. =Hostel and Holtby= Hostel is a small block between House and Darbishire, completed in 1950 by Geddes Hyslop. It houses 10 students over three floors. The Bursary is on the ground floor. Holtby, designed in 1951 and completed in 1956 by Hyslop, is situated above the library extension, adjacent to Park. It has ten rooms for undergraduates and is named after alumna Winifred Holtby.http://blogs.some.ox.ac.uk/jcr// =Vaughan and Margery Fry & Elizabeth Nuffield House= Designed by Sir Philip Dowson between 1958 and 1966, Vaughan and Margery Fry & Elizabeth Nuffield House (commonly shortened to Margery Fry) are both named for former principals of the college, whilst Elizabeth Nuffield was an important proponent of women's education and along with her husband Lord Nuffield, a financial benefactor of the college. Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and Vaughan was opened in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway in Little Clarendon Street. Vaughan is the larger of the two, with eleven rows to its concrete frame compared to the eight of Margery Fry. It is a Grade II-listed building and contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first-year students, along with the junior deans. Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks. Beneath the two buildings, a tunnel provides access to Somerville from Little Clarendon Street. Margery Fry serves as the centre of the postgraduate student community at Somerville and contains 24 graduate rooms. Other accommodation for graduate students is provided in buildings adjacent to the college. =Wolfson= Wolfson building Sir Philip Dowson was commissioned to design a building at the back of the college, to house undergraduates and offices for fellows and Wolfson is, in common with his other work in Somerville, constructed largely of glass and concrete; it is also a Grade II- listed building. A four-storey building, with five bays on each floor, Wolfson boasts impressive views of Walton Street from the rear and Somerville's main quadrangle from the front. Wolfson is named for the building's principal benefactor Sir Isaac Wolfson and was opened in 1967 by Principal Barbara Craig, with Harold Macmillan, Dorothy Hodgkin and Lord Wolfson all giving speeches. The ground floor contains the Flora Anderson Hall (FAH) and the Brittain-Williams Room, named after the college's most famous mother-daughter alumnae. The room was designed in 2012 by the architect Niall McLaughlin and opened on 29 November 2013 by alumna Baroness Shirley Williams, during an event that included her unveiling a portrait of herself, which now hangs in the room. The FAH is used for lectures and events, notably college parties (or bops) and mock exams, known as Collections. =Margaret Thatcher Centre and Dorothy Hodgkin Quadrangle= Named after the alumna-Prime Minister, the MTC comprises a lecture room, ante room and lobby used for meetings, conferences and other internal college events: the lecture room has full AV facilities and can accommodate 60 seated patrons. A bust of Margaret Thatcher stands in the lobby, and the meeting room contains portraits of Somerville's two prime- minister alumnae: Margaret Thatcher by Michael Noakes and Indira Gandhi by Sanjay Bhattacharyya. The Dorothy Hodgkin Quad (DHQ) was conceived in 1985, completed in 1991 and is named after Somerville's Nobel Prize-winner. The quadrangle is above the MTC and designed around self-contained flats of two and four bedrooms with communal kitchens, and houses mainly finalists and some second-year students. Architect Geoffrey Beard's scheme was submitted to the Oxford City Council in 1986 and the energies of Sir Geoffrey Leigh and alumna and former principal Baroness Daphne Park brought support from around the world. The buildings were opened in 1991 by Margaret Thatcher, Dorothy Hodgkin, Principal Catherine Hughes and College Visitor Baron Roy Jenkins. =St Paul's Nursery= Somerville College was the first Oxford college to provide a nursery for the children of Fellows and staff and is still one of the few colleges to do so. Alumna Dorothy Hodgkin donated much of her Nobel Prize money to the project. St Paul's Nursery is also open to families who are not connected with the college and cares for 16 children between the ages of three months and five years. =Radcliffe Observatory Quarter= ROQ East from outside the college ROQ East and West flank the north side of Somerville and overlook the site of the university's new Blavatnik School of Government and Mathematical Institute. Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first new buildings in the university's Radcliffe Observatory Quarter and have won four awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somerville's collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency. Energy-efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps. The buildings house 68 students, all in en-suite rooms, and there are a number of rooms and facilities designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over ¬£2.7 million from over 1,000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan. There is now an unimpeded view of the Radcliffe Observatory. =The Terrace= Before the Catherine Hughes Building, the most recent work in Somerville was the Terrace in 2013, a caf√© and bar attached to the Vaughan building (replacing the old bar in House). It is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black. Mainly used by members of the JCR, the Terrace has the usual pool table and bar facilities and also serves the college drink, \\"Stone-cold Jane Austen\\", which consists of blue VK, Southern Comfort, and Magners cider, as well as the \\"Somerville Sunset\\" and the \\"College Triple\\". =Catherine Hughes Building= Named after Somerville's late principal from 1989 to 1996, the Catherine Hughes Building was completed in October 2019 and provides 68 additional bedrooms. The new building, designed by Niall McLaughlin Architects, includes en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for graduate students. The red-brick building has a frontage onto Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points. The building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of the three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.Somerville College =Gardens= Somerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass. An unassuming frontage opens onto a vast green space looked after by two gardeners.Somerville Gardens The original site consisted of a paddock, an orchard and a vegetable garden and was bounded by large trees. It was home to a donkey, two cows, a pony and a pig. The paddock was soon transformed into tennis courts, where huge tents were erected during World War I. During World War II, large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and in Darbishire Quad, in case of firebombing, and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables. In the Main, or Library, Quad there is a cedar planted by Harold Macmillan in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a Picea likiangensis (var. rubescens), was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor Christmas tree. The library border of lavender and Agapanthus references the bluestocking reputation of Somerville, and the tory blue Ceratostigma willmottianum is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. The garden outside the Thatcher Centre, now dedicated to Lisa Minoprio, was originally designed by the former director of the Oxford Botanic Garden and Lecturer in Plant Sciences Timothy Walker, and retains yellow and blue as the thematic colours. There are nods to Somerville's long-standing links with India, the most notable being a large specimen of the Indian horse chestnut, Aesculus indica, planted on the Library lawn in 2019. Features of interest include a narrow bed of low growing Mediterranean plants in front of Wolfson in a modernist style, a varied selection of mature trees in the Library Quad, and large herbaceous borders containing the emblematic Somerville thistles (Echinops). The annual summer and winter bedding plants in Darbishire Quad, the beds outside the SCR, and in pots around site have traditionally been in the Victorian style which reflects the era of the inception of the college. However, this is evolving due to a change in garden management in late 2019, with the aims of following more environmentally friendly growing principles and developing a more contemporary style. The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form a secluded area, historically known as the Fellows' Garden (currently in a transitional phase), which is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall, and which were previously kitchen gardens. This walled garden is home to a sundial, commissioned in 1926 and commemorating first principal Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre, and a garden roller which was a gift from the parents of tutor Rose Sidgwick. In 1962, Henry Moore lent his work Falling Warrior to the college and Barbara Hepworth lent Core shortly afterwards. There are also permanent sculptures by Wendy Taylor, Friedrich Werthmann and Somervillian Polly Ionides. The most striking sculpture on site is Taylor's Triad (1971), which is situated on the Chapel Lawn in front of Maitland building. Student life Somerville College in snow In 2011 student satisfaction was rated in some categories as the highest in the university. Central to the college is its large quad, onto which most accommodation blocks back; it is often filled with students in summer. Somerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students (as opposed to just fellows) may walk on the grass. Somerville is sometimes nicknamed The Ville. Formal Halls take place on some Tuesdays and Fridays about six times a term. No gowns are worn and the grace is Benedictus benedicat. The college song is 'Omnes laetae nunc sodales'. =Sports= Somerville has a gym situated beneath Vaughan, with treadmills, cross-trainers and weights. Somerville shares a sports ground with Wadham College and St Hugh's College, in Marston Ferry Road. There are clubs and teams in men's and women's football, rugby (with Corpus Christi), mixed lacrosse, cricket, swimming, hockey, netball, basketball, pool, water polo, tennis, squash, badminton, cycling and croquet. Both the Somerville cricket and netball team won Cuppers for the 2014/15 season. The swimming team won Cuppers for the 2015/2016 season. Rowing Rowing blade design of Somerville College Boat Club Somerville formed a rowing team in 1921. The college competes in both of the annual university bumps races, Torpids and Summer Eights. The women are the most successful women's rowing team at the University of Oxford, having won the title Head of the River eight times in Summer Eights and five times in Torpids. The club shares the award-winning University College Boathouse on The Isis with St Peter's College, University College and Wolfson College. =Choir= Somerville College Chapel The Choir of Somerville College is mixed voice and led by the Director of Chapel Music, Will Dawes. In conjunction with the organ scholars, the choir is central to the musical life at the college. There are regular concerts and cathedral visits as well as recitals featuring soloists from the choir. In recent years the choir has toured Germany (2005 and 2009), Italy (2010) and the United States (2014 and 2016). The choir sings every term-time Sunday at the evening service. The organ of the college chapel is a traditionally voiced instrument by Harrison & Harrison. Somerville offers up to five Choral Exhibitions each year to applicants reading any subject. The college choir has released two CDs on the Stone Records label, \\"Requiem Aeternam\\" (2012) and \\"Advent Calendar\\" (2013). =Triennial Ball= Once every three years, Somerville hosts a ball jointly with Jesus College, Oxford. The last, for 1500 people, was held in May 2019 and the next ball will come in 2022. However, the 2013 ball, The Last Ball, was mired in controversy reported in national news. The organisers had intended to display a live nurse shark as entertainment. Permission for the shark was initially granted by the principal Alice Prochaska, but was subsequently revoked following student protests. The ball was widely condemned for poor organisation, examples of which included a lack of canap√©s and the presence of only one food stand, serving pork; the vegetarian options were said to run out quickly and revellers were reportedly set on fire by the pork r√¥tisserie. The Guardian reported \\"The ball descended into farce with guests questioning what the organisers had done with the money paid by 1,000 guests.\\" =Academic reputation= Somerville's Position in the Norrington Table since 2006 Before men were admitted Somerville, under the principalship of Barbara Craig, established a position at or near the head of the Norrington Table. Currently Somerville is in the lower half of the university's colleges for academic achievement. For the academic year 2018/19, it came 21st out of 30 in the Norrington Table, which lists the university's undergraduate colleges in order of their students' examination performances.\\"Undergraduate Degree Classifications\\". ox.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2019-27-12. =University Challenge= Somerville has had recent success disproportionate to its size on the TV quiz show University Challenge. It has won the competition once, triumphing in the University Challenge 2001‚Äì02 series by beating Imperial College, London by 200 points to 185. Croatian quizzer Dorjana ≈†irola was one of the contestants. Recently the college team reached the final of the University Challenge 2013‚Äì14 series, losing in the final to Trinity College, Cambridge, with a score of 135 to 240. =Trinitatis Horribilis 2015= During Trinity term 2015, Somerville was subject to national media coverage as a result of efforts by the principal, Alice Prochaska, to tackle \\"a rise in 'excessively harassing and intimidating behaviour' towards female students.\\"Somerville College principal warns of sexual harassment, BBC News, 15 May 2015 The Daily Telegraph quoted Prochaska as describing \\"numerous reports of groping at college parties, rape jokes overheard in communal areas\\".Oxford chief warns of worrying culture of sexual harassment and groping, The Daily Telegraph, 14 May 2015 The principal wrote in The Guardian of measures to address harassment and expressed a hope that \\"a spasm of nastiness among a small minority of students here has been nipped in the bud by the open condemnation of the majority.\\" India Somerville College plays a major role in the relations between Oxford and India. Cornelia Sorabji, born in the Bombay Presidency of British India, became the first Indian woman to study at any British university, when she came to Somerville in 1889 to read Law, while Indira Gandhi, India's first female prime minister, read Modern History at the college in 1937. Radhabai Subbarayan, the first woman member of the Indian Council of States (Rajya Sabha) studied at Somerville College as well, and so did princess Bamba Sutherland, the last surviving member of the family that had ruled the Sikh Empire in the Punjab, and her sister Catherine Hilda Duleep Singh. Other alumni with links to India include Moon Moon Sen, Agnes de Selincourt,Jane Haggis, Margaret Allen (Spring 2008) Imperial emotions: affective communities of mission in British Protestant women's missionary publications c1880-1920. Journal of Social History 41(3) 691-716. Smit Singh, Hilda Stewart Reid and Utsa Patnaik. Former principal Barbara Craig (1967‚Äì1980) and fellow Aditi Lahiri were born in Kolkata. Sonia Gandhi visited Somerville in 2002 and presented a portrait of her late mother-in-law to her alma mater. Indira Gandhi received an honorary degree from the college in 1971. In 2012, the college and Oxford University announced the creation of a ¬£19-million Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development. India provided ¬£3 million and the university and college ¬£5.5 million.Indira Gandhi Centre for Sustainable Development at Oxford University approved, The Hindu, 7 December 2012 The name was later changed to the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development (OICSD).Indira Gandhi‚Äôs name dropped from Oxford centre, Hindustan Times, 15 July 2017 The OICSD carries out research on sustainable development challenges facing India and provides scholarships for outstanding Indian students. The centre now hosts 12 India scholars. A new building is planned in the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, adjacent to the college's ROQ accommodation.Entwicklungshilfe.

People associated with Somerville =Alumni= Somervillians include Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi, Nobel Prize winning scientist Dorothy Hodgkin, journalist Esther Rantzen, reformer Cornelia Sorabji, writers A. S. Byatt, Vera Brittain, Susan Cooper, Penelope Fitzgerald, Winifred Holtby, Nicole Krauss, Iris Murdoch and Dorothy L. Sayers, politicians Shirley Williams, Margaret Jay and Sam Gyimah, Princess Bamba Sutherland and her sister, philosophers Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley and Onora O'Neill, archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon, actress Moon Moon Sen, soprano Emma Kirkby, banker Baroness Vadera and numerous (women's rights) activists. Somerville alumnae have achieved an impressive number of \\"firsts\\", both (inter)nationally and at the University of Oxford. Arguably the most prominent of these are: the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher; the first, and only, British woman to win a Nobel Prize in science Dorothy Hodgkin and the first woman to lead the world's largest democracy Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister of India for much of the 1970s. Somerville has educated at least 28 Dames, 16 heads of Oxford colleges, 11 life peers, ten MP's, four Olympic rowers, three of The 50 greatest British writers since 1945, two prime ministers, two princesses, a queen consort, and a Nobel laureate. Former students of Somerville belong to an alumni group, the Somerville Association, which was originally founded in 1888. =Fellows= Notable fellows of Somerville College include philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe, classical archaeologist Margarete Bieber, Egyptologist K√§the Bosse-Griffiths, biologist Marian Dawkins, classicist Edith Hall, author Alan Hollinghurst, astronomer Chris Lintott, International Federation of University Women founder Rose Sidgwick, botanist Timothy Walker, and philologist Anna Morpurgo Davies. =Principals= Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, the current principal The first principal of Somerville Hall was Madeleine Shaw-Lef√®vre (1879‚Äì1889). The first principal of Somerville College was Agnes Catherine Maitland (1889‚Äì1906), when in 1894 it became the first of the five women's halls to adopt the title of college, the first to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build a library. She was succeeded by the classical scholar Emily Penrose (1906‚Äì1926), who set up in 1903 the Mary Somerville Research Fellowship offering women in Oxford opportunities for research. The current principal is Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, who took up the appointment in August 2017, succeeding Alice Prochaska. To date seven principals have been alumnae of Somerville, two of St Hilda's College. Coat of arms and motto Like all Oxford colleges, Somerville has a variety of symbols and colours which are associated with it. The college's colours, which feature on the college scarf and on the blades of its boats, are red and black. The combination was originally adopted in the 1890s. Its flag has the shield from the arms on a yellow background. The two colours also feature in the college's coat of arms, which depicts three mullets in chevron reversed gules, between six crosses crosslet fitched sable. The college's motto, Donec rursus impleat orbem, was originally that of the family of Mary Somerville. Her family befriended the new hall, allowing it to adopt their arms and motto. The Latin motto itself is described as \\"baffling\\" as, although it translates as \\"Until It Should Fill the World Again\\", what the subject of the sentence (\\"it\\") is left unspecified. The crest, which is often omitted, is a hand grasping a crescent and occasionally a helmet with mantling is added. In popular culture *The mystery novel Gaudy Night by Dorothy L.

Typically this involves linking nouns to numbers and it is common practice to choose a noun that rhymes with the number it is associated with. These will be the pegs of the system. These associations have to be memorized one time and can be applied repeatedly to new information that needs to be memorized. Types of peg-word systems =Rhyming peg-word system= The Rhyming peg-word system is very simple, as stated above and could look something like this: # Bun: Visualize an association between the first item and a bun # Shoe: Visualize an association between the second item and a shoe # Tree: Visualize an association between the third item and a tree # Door: Visualize an association between the fourth item and a door # Hive: Visualize an association between the fifth item and a bee hive # Bricks: Visualize an association between the sixth item and bricks # Heaven: Visualize an association between the seventh item and Heaven # Gate: Visualize an association between the eighth item and a gate # Wine: Visualize an association between the ninth item and wine # Hen: Visualize an association between the tenth item and a chicken. For example, to remember the following grocery list of 10 items: # Apple: Picture an apple eating a bun # Butter: Picture a pad of butter melting on a shoe # Batteries: Picture a tree with batteries for leaves # Soap: Picture a door made from soap # Bread: Picture bees flying from a loaf of bread as if it is a hive # Milk: Picture a brick house with milk jugs where the bricks should be # Cat food: Picture an open can of cat food with angel wings and a halo # Lemons: Picture an elephant-sized lemon (with arms, legs and a hat) falling through a gate # Coffee: Picture burning your hands on a wine glass with hot coffee in it # Eggs: Picture an egg cracking and a hen popping out. The next step is to link the items with some sort of dramatic action, in order to record the order in which they appear. For example: # After the apple eats the bun # it starts eating a stick of butter. # The butter melts into a pool, in the middle of which sprouts a tree growing batteries. # A door materializes in the trunk of the tree, opens, and out walks a bar of soap. # The soap falls over and turns into a loaf of bread around which bees start flying # etc etc The less likely you are to have seen the scene in real life, the more likely it is to make a reliably retrievable impression. To optimize efficiency, if you were memorizing a shopping list, you would memorize the items in the order in which you would encounter them at the supermarket - the apple(s) with the lemon(s) and the butter with the milk and eggs, etc.. An additional layer of agility could also be achieved by setting each of the above scenes in their corresponding location in the supermarket. =Major system= While it is common to link rhyming nouns with numbers, that is by no means the only system. There is also the Major system, which connects sounds to numbers. The Major System is more complicated to learn than simple rhymes or alphabetic pegs, because it associates numbers 0-9 with a specific letter or sound, then larger numbers can combine to create words out of the sounds. It is limitless in the number of pegs it can produce. Furthermore, a recent modification to the Major System introduces the concept of dimensions. The most common association between numbers and letters is the following: *0 = s, x, z *1 = t,d *2 = n *3 = m *4 = r *5 = l *6 = sh, ch, j, soft g *7 = c, k, hard g, q *8 = f, v *9 = p, b This would make the number 33 \\"MM\\" which could be made into the word \\"mom\\" to better aid in memorization or 92 is \\"PN\\" and could become \\"pen.\\" \\"Cat\\" (or \\"cut\\") would correspond to 71, as vowels do not have any value. =PAO system= The Person-Action-Object (PAO) system is the most complex. It associates all numbers 00-99 with a distinctive person, action and object. Any six-digit number can be memorized by using the person assigned the first two digits, the action of the next two digits and the object of the third. For example: *The number 34 could be Frank Sinatra crooning into a microphone. *13 could be David Beckham kicking a soccer ball. *79 could then be Superman flying with a cape. This would make the number 341379, Frank Sinatra kicking a cape. Memory grand master, Ed Cooke, reportedly has been working on the Millennium PAO system, which would create an association for all numbers 000-999. Application The peg system is commonly used by Mental Athletes for memory competitions for events like card memorization as well as digit memorization. The peg system has also been applied in a classroom with learning disabled students. The students that used the peg system performed significantly better than the control in both immediate and delayed tests. Several studies have investigated the use of this memory mnemonic as a form of an imagery-based memory system within the process of learning a second- language. For example, if a native English speaker is attempting to learn Spanish, they will notice that the Spanish for duck is pato, which is pronounced similarly to the english word pot. The individual can develop a mnemonic peg system in order to remember this association by thinking of a duck with a pot in its head. One complaint concerning the peg system is that it seems to only be applicable in mundane situations. However, the peg system can be used to remember grocery lists, key points in speeches, and many other lists specific to one's particular area of study or interest. Many recognise that this system can be used to remember a wide variety of objects or information. The peg system works, so long as the information trying to be remembered is specific, able to be visualized, and tied to a unique retrieval cue. This tool of memory can be more efficient than rote memorization.

Formerly called Tubinares and still called tubenoses in English, procellariiforms are often referred to collectively as the petrels, a term that has been applied to all members of the order,Warham, J. (1996). The Behaviour, Population, Biology and Physiology of the Petrels. London: Academic Press, or more commonly all the families except the albatrosses.Brooke, 2004. They are almost exclusively pelagic (feeding in the open ocean), and have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world's oceans, with the highest diversity being around New Zealand. Procellariiforms are colonial, mostly nesting on remote, predator-free islands. The larger species nest on the surface, while most smaller species nest in natural cavities and burrows. They exhibit strong philopatry, returning to their natal colony to breed and returning to the same nesting site over many years. Procellariiforms are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds that are formed over several years and may last for the life of the pair. A single egg is laid per nesting attempt, and usually a single nesting attempt is made per year, although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years. Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing. Incubation times are long compared to other birds, as are fledging periods. Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care. Procellariiforms have had a long relationship with humans. They have been important food sources for many people, and continue to be hunted as such in some parts of the world. The albatrosses in particular have been the subject of numerous cultural depictions. Procellariiforms include some of the most endangered bird taxa, with many species threatened with extinction due to introduced predators in their breeding colonies, marine pollution and the danger of fisheries by- catch. Scientists, conservationists, fishermen, and governments around the world are working to reduce the threats posed to them, and these efforts have led to the signing of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001. Biology =Distribution and movements= The procellariiforms have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world's oceans and seas, although at the levels of family and genus there are some clear patterns. Antarctic petrels, Thalassoica antarctica, have to fly over to get to the ocean from their breeding colonies in Antarctica, and northern fulmars breed on the northeastern tip of Greenland, the furthest north piece of land. The most cosmopolitan family is the Procellariidae, which are found in tropical, temperate and polar zones of both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres, though the majority do not breed in the tropics, and half the species are restricted to southern temperate and polar regions. The gadfly petrels, Pterodroma, have a generally tropical and temperate distribution, whereas the fulmarine petrels are mostly polar with some temperate species. The majority of the fulmarine petrels, along with the prions, are confined to the Southern Hemisphere. The storm petrels are almost as widespread as the procellariids, and fall into two distinct subfamilies; the Oceanitinae have a mostly Southern Hemisphere distribution and the Hydrobatinae are found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. Amongst the albatrosses the majority of the family is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, feeding and nesting in cool temperate areas, although one genus, Phoebastria, ranges across the north Pacific. The family is absent from the north Atlantic, although fossil records indicate they bred there once. Finally the diving-petrels are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere. Migration The various species within the order have a variety of migration strategies. Some species undertake regular trans-equatorial migrations, such as the sooty shearwater which annually migrates from its breeding grounds in New Zealand and Chile to the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of , the longest measured annual migration of any bird. A number of other petrel species undertake trans- equatorial migrations, including the Wilson's storm petrel and the Providence petrel, but no albatrosses cross the equator, as they rely on wind assisted flight. There are other long-distance migrants within the order; Swinhoe's storm petrels breed in the western Pacific and migrates to the western Indian Ocean, and Bonin petrels nesting in Hawaii migrate to the coast of Japan during the non-breeding season. Navigation Many species in the order travel long distances over open water but return to the same nest site each year, raising the question of how they navigate so accurately. The Welsh naturalist Ronald Lockley carried out early research into animal navigation with the Manx shearwaters that nested on the island of Skokholm. In release experiments, a Manx shearwater flew from Boston to Skokholm, a distance of in 12 days.Cocker, 2005. pp. 21‚Äì24 Lockley showed that when released \\"under a clear sky\\" with sun or stars visible, the shearwaters oriented themselves and then \\"flew off in a direct line for Skokholm\\", making the journey so rapidly that they must have flown almost in a straight line. But if the sky was overcast at the time of release, the shearwaters flew around in circles \\"as if lost\\" and returned slowly or not at all, implying that they navigated using astronomical cues. =Morphology and flight= The southern royal albatross is one of the largest of the Procellariiformes. Procellariiforms range in size from the very large wandering albatross, at and a wingspan, to tiny birds like the least storm petrel, at with a wingspan, and the smallest of the prions, the fairy prion, with a wingspan of . Their nostrils are enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight deeply-grooved bills with hooked tips. The beaks are made up of several plates. Their wings are long and narrow; the feet are webbed, and the hind toe is undeveloped or non-existent; their adult plumage is predominantly black, white, and grey. The order has a few unifying characteristics, starting with their tubular nasal passage which is used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate their nests within nesting colonies. The structure of the bill, which contains seven to nine distinct horny plates, is another unifying feature, although there are differences within the order. Petrels have a plate called the maxillary unguis that forms a hook on the maxilla. The smaller members of the order have a comb-like mandible, made by the tomial plate, for plankton feeding. Most members of the order are unable to walk well on land, and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night. The exceptions are the huge albatrosses, several of the gadfly petrels and shearwaters and the fulmar-petrels. The latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious stomach oil, which they can project some distance. This stomach oil, stored in the proventriculus, is a digestive residue created in the foregut of all tubenoses except the diving petrels, and is used mainly for storage of energy-rich food during their long flights. The oil is also fed to their young, as well as being used for defence. The white- faced storm petrel moves across the water's surface in a series of bounding leaps. Procellariiforms drink seawater, so they have to excrete excess salt. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill, above the eyes, and in the Procellariiformes the gland is active. In general terms, the salt gland removes salt from the system and forms a 5 percent saline solution that drips out of the nostrils, or is forcibly ejected in some petrels. The processes behind this involve high levels of sodium ion reabsorption into the blood plasma within the kidneys, and secretion of sodium chloride via the salt glands using less water than was absorbed, which essentially generates salt- free water for other physiological uses. This high efficiency of sodium ion absorption is attributed to mammalian-type nephrons. Most albatrosses and procellariids use two techniques to minimise exertion while flying, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. The albatrosses and giant petrels share a morphological adaptation to aid in flight, a sheet of tendon which locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort. Amongst the Oceanitinae storm-petrels there are two unique flight patterns, one being surface pattering. In this they move across the water surface holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water, and remaining stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. A similar flight method is thought to have been used by the extinct petrel family Diomedeoididae. The white-faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering: holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind, it pushes itself off the water's surface in a succession of bounding jumps. =Diet and feeding= The procellariiforms are for the most part exclusively marine foragers; the only exception to this rule are the two species of giant petrel, which regularly feed on carrion or other seabirds while on land. While some other species of fulmarine and Procellaria petrels also take carrion, the diet of most species of albatrosses and petrels is dominated by fish, squid, krill and other marine zooplankton. The importance of these food sources varies from species to species and family to family. For example, of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, the black-footed albatross takes mostly fish, while the Laysan feeds mainly on squid.Brooke, 2004. p. 126 The albatrosses in general feed on fish, squid and krill. Among the procellariids, the prions concentrate on small crustacea, the fulmarine petrels take fish and krill but little squid, while the Procellaria petrels consume mainly squid. The storm petrels take small droplets of oil from the surface of the water, as well as small crustaceans and fish.Brooke, 2004. p. 127 Petrels obtain food by snatching prey while swimming on the surface, snatching prey from the wing or diving down under the water to pursue prey. Dipping down from flight is most commonly used by the gadfly petrels and the storm petrels. There have been records of wedge-tailed shearwaters snatching flying fish from the air, but as a rule this technique is rare. Some diving birds may aid diving by beginning with a plunge from the air, but for the most part petrels are active divers and use their wings to move around under the water. The depths achieved by various species were determined in the 1990s and came as a surprise to scientists; short-tailed shearwaters have been recorded diving to and the Light-mantled sooty albatross to .Brooke, 2004. pp. 128‚Äì131 =Breeding behaviour= Breeding colonies Christmas shearwaters are one of the surface-nesting tropical procellariiforms. All procellariiforms are colonial, predominantly breeding on offshore or oceanic islands. The few species that nest on continents do so in inhospitable environments such as dry deserts or on Antarctica. These colonies can vary from the widely spaced colonies of the giant petrels to the dense 3.6 million-strong colonies of Leach's storm petrels. For almost all species the need to breed is the only reason that procellariiforms return to land at all. Some of the larger petrels have to nest on windswept locations as they require wind to take off and forage for food. Within the colonies, pairs defend usually small territories (the giant petrels and some albatrosses can have very large territories) which is the small area around either the nest or a burrow. Competition between pairs can be intense, as is competition between species, particularly for burrows. Larger species of petrels will even kill the chicks and even adults of smaller species in disputes over burrows. Burrows and natural crevices are most commonly used by the smaller species; all the storm petrels and diving petrels are cavity nesters, as are many of the procellariids. The fulmarine petrels and some tropical gadfly petrels and shearwaters are surface nesters, as are all the albatrosses. Procellariiforms show high levels of philopatry, both site fidelity and natal philopatry. Natal philopatry is the tendency of an individual bird to return to its natal colony to breed, often many years after leaving the colony as a chick. This tendency has been shown through ringing studies and mitochondrial DNA studies. Birds ringed as chicks have been recaptured close to their original nests, sometimes extremely close; in the Laysan albatross the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was , and a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. Mitochondrial DNA provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, strongly suggesting philopatry. The other type of philopatry exhibited is site fidelity, where pairs of birds return to the same nesting site for a number of years. Among the most extreme examples known of this tendency was the fidelity of a ringed northern fulmar that returned to the same nest site for 25 years. The average number of birds returning to the same nest sites is high in all species studied, with around 91 percent for Bulwer's petrels, and 85 percent of males and 76 percent of females for Cory's shearwaters (after a successful breeding attempt). Pair bonds and life history Wandering albatrosses performing their mating dances on the Kerguelen Islands Procellariiforms are monogamous breeders and form long-term pair bonds. These pair bonds take several years to develop in some species, particularly with the albatrosses. Once formed, they last for many breeding seasons, in some cases for the life of the pair. Petrel courtship can be elaborate. It reaches its extreme with the albatrosses, where pairs spend many years perfecting and elaborating mating dances. These dances are composed of synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). Each particular pair will develop their own individual version of the dance. The breeding behaviour of other procellariiforms is less elaborate, although similar bonding behaviours are involved, particularly for surface- nesting species. These can involve synchronised flights, mutual preening and calling. Calls are important for helping birds locate potential mates and distinguishing between species, and may also help individuals assess the quality of potential mates. After pairs have been formed, calls serve to help them reunite; the ability of individuals to recognise their own mate has been demonstrated in several species. Procellariiforms are K-selected, being long- lived and caring extensively for their few offspring. Breeding is delayed for several years after fledging, sometimes for as long as ten years in the largest species. Once they begin breeding, they make only a single breeding attempt per nesting season; even if the egg is lost early in the season, they seldom re-lay. Much effort is placed into laying a single (proportionally) large egg and raising a single chick. Procellariiforms are long-lived: the longest living albatross known survived for 51 years, but was probably older, and even the tiny storm-petrels are known to have survived for 30 years.Klimkiewicz, M. K. 2007. Longevity Records of North American Birds . Version 2007.1. Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. Bird Banding Laboratory. Laurel MD. Nesting and chick rearing A semi-precocial wedge-tailed shearwater chick with guarding parent The majority of procellariiforms nest once a year and do so seasonally.Brooke, 2004. p. 46 Some tropical shearwaters, like the Christmas shearwater, are able to nest on cycles slightly shorter than a year, and the large great albatrosses (genus Diomedea) nest in alternate years (if successful). Most temperate and polar species nest over the spring-summer, although some albatrosses and procellariids nest over the winter. In the tropics, some species can be found breeding throughout the year, but most nest in discreet periods. Procellariiforms return to nesting colonies as much as several months before laying, and attend their nest sites regularly before copulation. Prior to laying, females embark on a lengthy pre- laying exodus to build up energy reserves in order to lay the exceptionally large egg. In the stormy petrel, a very small procellariiform, the egg can be 29 percent of the body weight of the female, while in the grey-faced petrel, the female may spend as much as 80 days feeding out at sea after courtship before laying the egg. When the female returns and lays, incubation is shared between the sexes, with the male taking the first incubation stint and the female returning to sea. The duration of individual stints varies from just a few days to as much as several weeks, during which the incubating bird can lose a considerable amount of weight.Warham, J. (1990) The Petrels ‚Äì Their Ecology and Breeding Systems London: Academic Press. The incubation period varies from species to species, around 40 days for the smallest storm-petrels but longer for the largest species; for albatrosses it can span 70 to 80 days, which is the longest incubation period of any bird.Brooke, 2004. p. 67 A Laysan albatross feeds its chick. The parent pumps food from a modified foregut, the proventriculus, and the chick catches the meal in its lower mandible. Upon hatching, the chicks are semi-precocial, having open eyes, a dense covering of white or grey down feathers, and the ability to move around the nesting site. After hatching, the incubating adult remains with the chick for a number of days, a period known as the guard phase. In the case of most burrow-nesting species, this is only until the chick is able to thermoregulate, usually two or three days. Diving-petrel chicks take longer to thermoregulate and have a longer guard phase than other burrow nesters. However, surface-nesting species, which have to deal with a greater range of weather and to contend with predators like skuas and frigatebirds, consequently have a longer guard phase (as long as two weeks in procellariids and three weeks in albatrosses).Brooke, 2004. p. 75 The chick is fed by both parents. Chicks are fed on fish, squid, krill, and stomach oil. Stomach oil is oil composed of neutral dietary lipids that are the residue created by digestion of the prey items. As an energy source for chicks it has several advantages over undigested prey, its calorific value is around 9.6 kcal per gram, which is only slightly lower than the value for diesel oil. This can be a real advantage for species that range over huge distances to provide food for hungry chicks. The oil is also used in defence. All procellariiforms create stomach oil except the diving-petrels. The chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching, almost twice as long as a gull of the same body mass. The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food. First, there are few predators at the nesting colonies, therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly. Second, the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage, thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death. The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development. Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase, but afterward become less frequent. However, each feed can deliver a large amount of energy; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night, probably when fed by both parents. Relationship with humans =Role in culture= The Albatross about my Neck was Hung: 1896 etching by William Strang illustrating Coleridge's 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner The most important family culturally is the albatrosses, which have been described by one author as \\"the most legendary of birds\\".Carboneras, C. (1992) \\"Family Diomedeidae (Albatross)\\" in Handbook of Birds of the World Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, Albatrosses have featured in poetry in the form of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which in turn gave rise to the usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden. More generally, albatrosses were believed to be good omens, and to kill one would bring bad luck. There are few instances of petrels in culture, although there are sailors' legends regarding the storm petrels, which are considered to warn of oncoming storms. In general, petrels were considered to be \\"soul birds\\", representing the souls of drowned sailors, and it was considered unlucky to touch them.Carboneras, C. (1992) \\"Family Hydrobatidae (Storm- petrels)\\" pp. 258‚Äì265 in Handbook of Birds of the World Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, In the Russian language, many petrel species from the Hydrobatidae and Procellariidae families of the order Procellariiformes are known as burevestnik, which literally means 'the announcer of the storm'. When in 1901, the Russian writer Maxim Gorky turned to the imagery of subantarctic avifauna to describe Russian society's attitudes to the coming revolution, he used a storm-announcing petrel as the lead character of a poem that soon became popular in the revolutionary circles as \\"the battle anthem of the revolution\\".\\"A Legend Exhumed\\", review of \\"STORMY PETREL: THE LIFE AND WORK OF MAXIM GORKY\\" by Dan Levin. 329 pages. Appleton-Century. Review published in the Time Magazine, Friday, Jun. 25, 1965 Although the species called \\"stormy petrel\\" in English is not one of those to which the burevestnik name is applied in Russian (it, in fact, is known in Russian as an entirely un- romantic kachurka), the English translators uniformly used the \\"stormy petrel\\" image in their translations of the poem, usually known in English as The Song of the Stormy Petrel.\\"The Song of the Stormy Petrel\\", Translation by Sally Ryan =Exploitation= engraving in Bewick's A History of British Birds, showing men exploiting birds nesting on sea cliffs, 1804 Albatrosses and petrels have been important food sources for humans for as long as people have been able to reach their remote breeding colonies. Amongst the earliest-known examples of this is the remains of shearwaters and albatrosses along with those of other seabirds in 5,000-year-old middens in Chile, although it is likely that they were exploited prior to this. Since then, many other marine cultures, both subsistence and industrial, have exploited procellariiforms, in some cases almost to extinction. Some cultures continue to harvest shearwaters (a practice known as muttonbirding); for example, the MƒÅori of New Zealand use a sustainable traditional method known as kaitiakitanga. In Alaska, residents of Kodiak Island harpoon short-tailed albatrosses, Diomedea albatrus, and until the late 1980s residents of Tristan Island in the Indian Ocean harvested the eggs of the Yellow-nosed Mollymawks, Diomedea chlororhynchos, and sooty albatrosses, Phoebetria fusca. Albatrosses and petrels are also now tourist draws in some locations, such as Taiaroa Head. While such exploitation is non- consumptive, it can have deleterious effects that need careful management to protect both the birds and the tourism. The English naturalist William Yarrell wrote in 1843 that \\"ten or twelve years ago, Mr. Gould exhibited twenty-four [storm petrels], in a large dish, at one of the evening meetings of the Zoological Society\\". The engraver Thomas Bewick wrote in 1804 that \\"Pennant, speaking of those [birds] which breed on, or inhabit, the Isle of St Kilda, says‚Äî'No bird is of so much use to the islanders as this: the Fulmar supplies them with oil for their lamps, down for their beds, a delicacy for their tables, a balm for their wounds, and a medicine for their distempers.'\\" A photograph by George Washington Wilson taken about 1886 shows a \\"view of the men and women of St Kilda on the beach dividing up the catch of Fulmar\\". James Fisher, author of The Fulmar (1952) calculated that every person on St Kilda consumed over 100 fulmars each year; the meat was their staple food, and they caught around 12,000 birds annually. However, when the human population left St Kilda in 1930, the population did not suddenly grow.Cocker, 2005. pp. 12‚Äì18 =Threats and conservation= The poorly known New Zealand storm petrel was considered extinct for 150 years before being rediscovered in 2003. The albatrosses and petrels are \\"amongst the most severely threatened taxa worldwide\\". They face a variety of threats, the severity of which varies greatly from species to species. Several species are among the most common of seabirds, including Wilson's storm petrel (an estimated 12 to 30 million individuals) and the short-tailed shearwater (23 million individuals); while the total population of some other species is a few hundred. There are less than 200 Magenta petrels breeding on the Chatham Islands, only 130 to 160 Zino's petrels and only 170 Amsterdam albatrosses. Only one species is thought to have become extinct since 1600, the Guadalupe storm petrel of Mexico, although a number of species had died out before this. Numerous species are very poorly known; for example, the Fiji petrel has rarely been seen since its discovery. The breeding colony of the New Zealand storm petrel was not located until February 2013; it had been thought extinct for 150 years until its rediscovery in 2003, while the Bermuda petrel had been considered extinct for nearly 300 years. Black-browed albatross hooked on a long-line The principal threat to the albatrosses and larger species of procellariids is long-line fishing. Bait set on hooks is attractive to foraging birds and many are hooked by the lines as they are set. As many as 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries.BirdLife International/RSPB (2005) Save the Albatross: The Problem Retrieved March 17, 2006 Before 1991 and the ban on drift-net fisheries, it was estimated that 500,000 seabirds a year died as a result. This has caused steep declines in some species, as procellariiforms are extremely slow breeders and cannot replace their numbers fast enough. Losses of albatrosses and petrels in the Southern Ocean were estimated at between 1 percent and 16 percent per year, which these species cannot sustain for long. Exotic species introduced to the remote breeding colonies threaten all types of procellariiform. These principally take the form of predators; most albatross and petrel species are clumsy on land and unable to defend themselves from mammals such as rats, feral cats and pigs. This phenomenon, ecological naivete, has resulted in declines in many species and was implicated in the extinction of the Guadalupe storm petrel. Already in 1910 Godman wrote: This albatross bolus found in the Hawaiian Islands includes flotsam that was ingested but successfully ejected along with other indigestible matter. If such flotsam cannot be ejected it may cause sickness or death. Introduced herbivores may unbalance the ecology of islands; introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island off New South Wales, which increased the vulnerability of the Gould's petrels nesting on the island to natural predators, and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the native birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera). In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible. Exploitation has decreased in importance as a threat. Other threats include the ingestion of plastic flotsam. Once swallowed, plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. It can also be picked up by foraging adults and fed to chicks, stunting their development and reducing the chances of successfully fledging.Auman, H.J., Ludwig, J.P., Giesy, J.P., Colborn, T., (1997) \\"Plastic ingestion by Laysan Albatross chicks on Sand Island, Midway Atoll, in 1994 and 1995.\\" in Albatross Biology and Conservation, G. Robinson and R. Gales (eds.). Surrey Beatty & Sons: Chipping Norton. pp. 239‚Äì44 Procellariids are also vulnerable to marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as Barau's petrel, Newell's shearwater and Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands, are victims of light pollution. Fledging chicks are attracted to streetlights and may then be unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of fledging Barau's petrels and 45 to 60 percent of fledging Cory's shearwater are attracted to the streetlights on R√©union and Tenerife, respectively. Taxonomy and systematics Pterodroma macroptera from Godman's Monograph of the Petrels, 1907‚Äì1910 Procellariiformes comes from the Latin word procella, which means a violent wind or a storm, and -iformes for order.* The order was named Procellariiformes by German anatomist Max F√ºrbringer in 1888. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the family Hydrobatidae was named Procellariidae, and the family now called Procellariidae was rendered \\"Puffinidae.\\" The order itself was called Tubinares. A major early work on this group is Frederick DuCane Godman's Monograph of the Petrels, five fascicles, 1907‚Äì1910, with figures by John Gerrard Keulemans. In the Sibley- Ahlquist taxonomy, the tubenoses were included in a greatly enlarged order \\"Ciconiiformes\\". This taxonomic treatment was almost certainly erroneous, but its assumption of a close evolutionary relationship with other \\"higher waterbirds\\" ‚Äì such as loons (Gaviiformes) and penguins (Sphenisciformes) ‚Äì appears to be correct. The procellariiforms are (2014) considered to be most closely related to penguins, having diverged from them about 60 million years ago. There are around 140 living species of procellariiform worldwide, and the order is divided into four extant families, with a fifth prehistorically extinct: * Family ‚Ä†Diomedeoididae (Early Oligocene ‚Äì Early Miocene) is an extinct group that had narrow beaks and feet with wide, flat phalanges, especially on the fourth toe. * Family Procellariidae (shearwaters, fulmarine petrels, gadfly petrels, and prions) are a varied group of small or medium- sized seabirds, the largest being the giant petrels. They are heavy for their size, with a high wing loading, so they need to fly fast. Most, except the giant petrels, have weak legs and are nearly helpless on land. * Family Diomedeidae (albatrosses) are very large seabirds with a large strong hooked bill. They have strong legs, enabling them to walk well on land.Tickell, W.L.N. (2000). Albatrosses. Pica Press. * Family Hydrobatidae (storm petrels) are among the smallest seabirds, with fluttering flight and long but weak legs. Most have dark upperparts and a white underside.Carboneras, C. (1992) \\"Family Hydrobatidae (Storm petrels)\\" pp. 258‚Äì265 in Handbook of Birds of the World Vol 1. Barcelona:Lynx Edicions, * Family Pelecanoididae (diving petrels) are small with short bills and wings, and a whirring flight low over the water and through wave-crests.Olson, S.L. (1985) Pelecanoididae in Farner, D.S.; King, J.R. & Parkes, Kenneth C. (eds.): Avian Biology 8: 79‚Äì238. Academic Press, New York. The Hydrobatidae's two subfamilies, Oceanitinae and Hydrobatinae, are probably better treated as distinct families. However, the traditional view may not correctly represent the phylogeny of Procellariiformes. The storm petrels are two separate clades. All other tubenoses are part of the albatross clade. The diving petrels are a clade, but within a larger clade of true petrels that also contains the gadfly petrels. Most fossil species broadly resemble living tubenoses, including the oldest confirmed record, Tydea septentrionalis from the Oligocene in Belgium. DNA evidence has confirmed common ancestry for all procellariiforms, though the taxonomy within the order is complex and fluctuating. Fossils of a bird similar to a petrel from the Eocene have been found in the London Clay and in Louisiana. Diving petrels occurred in the Miocene, with a species from that family (Pelecanoides miokuaka) being described in 2007. The most numerous fossils from the Paleogene are those from the extinct family Diomedeoididae, fossils of which have been found in Central Europe and Iran. References Bibliography * Brooke, M.

Spock, who was originally played by Leonard Nimoy, first appeared in the original Star Trek series serving aboard the starship Enterprise as science officer and first officer, and later as commanding officer of two iterations of the vessel. Spock's mixed human-Vulcan heritage serves as an important plot element in many of the character's appearances. Along with Captain James T. Kirk and Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy, he is one of the three central characters in the original Star Trek series and its films. After retiring from active duty in Starfleet, Spock serves as a Federation ambassador, and later becomes involved in the ill-fated attempt to save Romulus from a supernova, leading him to live out the rest of his life in a parallel timeline. Spock was played by Nimoy in the original Star Trek series, the animated Star Trek series, eight of the Star Trek feature films, and a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Multiple actors have played the character since Nimoy within Star Treks main continuity. The most recent portrayal is Ethan Peck, who played Spock as a recurring character in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery and in Star Trek: Short Treks. He will reprise the role, this time as a main character, in the upcoming Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, which will act as both a Discovery spin-off and a prequel to the original Star Trek series. Additionally, Zachary Quinto played Spock in the feature films Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016). Although these last three films are set in the aforementioned parallel timeline, Nimoy appears in the first two films as the original timeline's Spock. The character has appeared in numerous Star Trek novels, comics, and video games. Appearances =Background= Spock's backstory has been explained during the course of several episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series, the 2009 film Star Trek and the episode \\"Yesteryear\\" of Star Trek: The Animated Series. Spock was born to the Vulcan Sarek and the human Amanda Grayson. Due to this mixed-species heritage, Spock had to be removed from Amanda's body and raised in a test tube for two months, during which time Vulcan scientists made subtle chemical adjustments to the fetus to ensure its survival. The fetus was returned to Amanda's body to complete the human gestation period, then put in an incubator for four months to complete Vulcan gestation. He is the first such mixed-species child to survive.\\"Gene Roddenberry: Inside Star Trek\\" Columbia ‚Äì PC 34279 1976 Spock had a troubled childhood due to his mixed heritage. Full-blooded Vulcan children repeatedly bullied Spock on their home world to incite the emotions of his human nature. For a time, he grew up alongside his older half-brother Sybok, until the older brother was cast out for rejecting logic. According to the episode \\"Amok Time\\", Spock was betrothed to T'Pring (Arlene Martel) during his childhood. Sarek supported Spock's scientific learning and application to the Vulcan Science Academy, as mentioned in \\"Journey to Babel\\". In the 2009 film Star Trek, Spock rejects his acceptance into the Vulcan Science Academy on the basis that they would never fully accept someone who was only half-Vulcan. Although this film set the Kelvin timeline scene in this and later films, writer Roberto Orci stated that he felt that the actions were unaffected by the changes in this timeline and so would have occurred in the same manner prior to The Original Series. Because Spock did not enter the VSA and sought to join Starfleet instead, he did not speak to his father for the following 18 years. =\\"The Cage\\" and the first season= Spock, as played by Leonard Nimoy, as seen in the pilots of Star Trek Spock appeared as the science officer on the USS Enterprise in the first pilot for the series, \\"The Cage\\". This was not shown on television at the time, but the events of the episode were shown in the two-part episode \\"The Menagerie\\" of the first season, and Spock's previous 11 years of service on the Enterprise were described. Spock was one of the members of the away team who joined Captain Christopher Pike (Jeffrey Hunter) on a mission to Talos IV in order to investigate a distress call. Spock did appear in the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", but this was broadcast initially as the third episode. During the events of that pilot, Spock became concerned at the risk to the ship posed by Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and suggested possible solutions to Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner). The earliest appearance of Spock in the series as broadcast was \\"The Man Trap\\", the first such episode. When he needs to knock out an evil version of Kirk in \\"The Enemy Within\\", he uses a Vulcan nerve pinch. Spock and Chief Engineer Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott (James Doohan) work together to rejoin the good and evil versions of the Captain, which had been split following a transporter accident. During \\"Miri\\", he finds himself to be the only member of the landing party to be immune to the physical effects of the disease affecting human adults on the planet. However, he realises that he is probably a carrier and could infect the Enterprise if he were to return. Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) manages to devise a cure, allowing the team to return to the ship. When Simon van Gelder enters the bridge armed with a phaser in \\"Dagger of the Mind\\", Spock subdues him with a nerve pinch. He later conducts a mind meld with van Gelder as part of the investigation into the activities of the nearby colony. After the power to the colony is shut down, and a protective force field drops, Spock leads an away team to rescue Kirk. Spock is reunited with Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) in \\"The Menagerie\\". Pike had been promoted to Fleet Captain but suffered an accident, resulting in severe burns and confining him to a wheelchair and restricting his communication to yes/no answers via a device connected to his brainwaves. Spock commits mutiny and directs the ship to travel to Talos IV, a banned planet. He recounts the events of \\"The Cage\\" under a tribunal to Kirk, Pike and Commodore Jose I. Mendez (Malachi Throne). As the Enterprise arrives at the planet, Mendez is revealed to be a Talosian illusion. At the same time, the real Mendez communicates from Starfleet, giving permission for Pike to be transported to the planet, and all charges against Spock are dropped. Spock with his parents, Sarek and Amanda While the Enterprise is under threat in \\"Balance of Terror\\", Spock is accused by Lieutenant Stiles (Paul Comi) of knowing more about the Romulans than he admits when the alien's similar physical appearance is revealed. Spock hypothesises that they are an offshoot of the Vulcan race. He saves the Enterprise, manning the phaser station and saves the life of Stiles in the process. Spock leads a landing party on the shuttlecraft Galileo in \\"The Galileo Seven\\", which is damaged and pulled off course and lands on the planet Taurus II. Lieutenant Boma (Don Marshall) criticises Spock's fascination with the weaponry of the natives after the death of Lieutenant Latimer (Rees Vaughn) at their hands. After Scotty uses the power packs of the party's phasers to supply enough energy to get the damaged shuttle back into orbit, Spock decides to dump and ignite the remaining fuel to attract the attention of the Enterprise. The procedure is successful and the crew on the shuttle are rescued. Spock is reunited with Leila Kalomi (Jill Ireland) in \\"This Side of Paradise\\"; after joining an away team to the planet Omicron Ceti III. After being affected by planet spores, Spock begins showing emotion and re-initiates his romantic liaison with Kalomi. The impact of the spores on him is cured after Kirk goads him into anger, and once freed of the effects, Spock is able to initiate a solution which cures the rest of the crew. Spock attempts to mind meld with a non- humanoid Horta in \\"The Devil in the Dark\\", having initially suggested that Kirk should kill the creature. Following a second mind meld, Spock relays the history of the Horta and is able to create peace between the aliens and a nearby colony. Both Spock and Kirk undertake guerrilla warfare against the occupying Klingon forces on the planet Organia, prior to the establishment of the Organian Peace Treaty in \\"Errand of Mercy\\". To restore the timeline, he travels with Kirk back to 1930's New York City in \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\". He uses technology of that period to interface with his tricorder over the course of the weeks they spend in the period before witnessing Edith Keeler's (Joan Collins) death. =Season two and three= In the premiere episode of the second season, \\"Amok Time\\", Spock begins to undergo pon farr, the Vulcan blood fever, and must undergo a ritual mating in the next eight days or die. Kirk disobeys Starfleet orders and takes the Enterprise to the planet Vulcan so that Spock can undergo the mating ritual. When they arrive, he is reunited with T'Pring (Arlene Martel). She rather wishes to be with Stonn (Lawrence Montaigne), a full-blooded Vulcan. She demands the ritual kal- if-fee fight instead, and selects Kirk as her champion, who unknowingly agrees to a fight to the death with Spock. McCoy persuades T'Pau (Celia Lovsky) to let him inject Kirk with something to alleviate the issues with Vulcan's thinner atmosphere and make the fight fair. The fight begins, and Spock gains the upper hand, garroting Kirk and killing him. McCoy orders an emergency transport directly to sickbay, while Spock is told by T'Pring that it was all a game of logic which would let her be with Stonn no matter the outcome. No longer feeling the effects of the pon farr, Spock returns to the Enterprise where he discovers that McCoy had injected Kirk with a paralyzing agent which merely simulated death and that the Captain was still alive. During the course of the encounter with the Nomad space probe in \\"The Changeling\\", Spock undertakes a mind meld with the machine. Kirk stops the meld when he realises that Spock's personality starts to be changed by the contact. Following a transporter accident which transports Kirk, McCoy, Uhura and Scotty to a Mirror Universe and swaps them with their counterparts in the episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", they encounter a different version of Spock. Sporting a beard, he grows suspicious of the activities of the suddenly changed personnel and under Starfleet orders, attempts to kill Kirk. Mirror-Spock is knocked unconscious, and is treated by McCoy while the others head to the transporter to attempt to return to their universe. Spock awakes and mind melds with McCoy to discover why Kirk did not have him killed. Discovering what took place, he agrees to help them return and as he mans the transporter controls, Kirk implores him to take control and save not only the ship but his Terran Empire from implosion at the hands of tyrants. The switch is once again successful, and the crew members return to their relevant universes. =The Motion Picture and the film series= At the beginning of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Spock is no longer in Starfleet, having resigned and returned home to pursue the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr. Spock is unable to complete the Kolinahr ritual after he senses the coming of V'ger, and rejoins Starfleet to aid the Enterprise crew in their mission. Spock, promoted to captain, is commanding officer of the Enterprise at the beginning of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). At the film's end, he transfers his \\"katra\\" ‚Äì the sum of his memories and experience ‚Äì to McCoy, and then sacrifices himself to save the ship and its crew from Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalb√°n). The sequel, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984), focuses on his crewmates' quest to recover Spock's body, learning upon arrival that he has been resurrected by the Genesis matrix after landing on the planet at the end of the previous film. At the film's conclusion, Spock's revived body is reunited with his katra. Spock is next seen in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986), which depicts his recovery from the after-effects of his resurrection. In the film's final scene, he joins the crew of the newly commissioned USS Enterprise-A under Kirk's command. In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), Spock and the Enterprise crew confront the renegade Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) reunites the Enterprise crew on a mission to prevent war from erupting between the Federation and Klingon Empire. Spock serves as a special envoy to broker peace with the Klingons after a natural disaster devastates their homeworld. =Star Trek: The Next Generation= After a period in which the production team avoided mentioning some aspects of The Original Series, Spock was mentioned by name in Star Trek: The Next Generation in the episode \\"Sarek\\" (1990). Executive producer Michael Piller later described this one act as \\"the breakthrough which allowed us to open the doors, that allowed us to begin to embrace our past\\". Spock appears in \\"Unification\\" (1991), a two-part episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Set 75 years after the events of The Undiscovered Country, the episode focuses on Federation Ambassador Spock's attempt to reunite the Romulans with their Vulcan brethren. Filming of The Undiscovered Country overlapped with production of this episode, and the episode references Spock's role in the film. =Reboot films= Zachary Quinto as Spock in the 2009 Star Trek film Star Trek (2009) Spock's next appearance in the live action Star Trek franchise is the 2009 Star Trek film. Nimoy was given approval rights over Spock's casting and supported Quinto's casting.John Hiscock, \\"Star Trek: J.J. Abrams Interview [2009]\\", in Brent Dunham, ed., J. J. Abrams: Interviews (Jackson: Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2018), 41-43. and online at books.google.com/books?id=-fl0DwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA41 In the film's flashback (set 19 years after the events of \\"Unification\\", and as depicted in the comic miniseries Star Trek: Countdown), Ambassador Spock (Nimoy) promises the Romulans he will use Vulcan technology to save them from a rogue supernova that threatens to destroy their Empire. He pilots an advanced starship equipped with red matter, a powerful substance able to create artificial black holes. The mission is only partially successful, and in the aftermath Spock is pursued into the past by Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan driven mad by the loss of his homeworld and family, setting into motion the events of the film. In the film's opening act, Nero's ship emerges in the year 2233, and through its interaction with the inhabitants, inadvertently creates an \\"alternate, parallel 'Star Trek' universe\\". Twenty-five years later in the new reality, Spock's ship emerges, and Nero captures him and the red matter. Stranded in the alternate past, the prime version of Spock helps the alternate, younger version of himself and Kirk (Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine, respectively) thwart Nero's attempt to destroy the Federation. The film also features Jacob Kogan in several scenes depicting Spock's childhood, including his abuse at the hands of other Vulcan children due to his half-Human heritage, and his relationship with his parents (Ben Cross and Winona Ryder). The film also depicts Kirk and Spock's initial clashes at Starfleet Academy, and the gradual development of their friendship based on shared mutual respect, what the elder Spock calls \\"... a friendship that will define them both in ways they cannot yet realize.\\" A major change in characterization from the primary timeline is alternate Spock's involvement with alternate Uhura (Zoe Saldana), his former student. At the end of the film, the young Spock opts to remain in Starfleet while his older self stays in the altered universe to aid the few surviving Vulcan refugees, as Nero had destroyed Vulcan, Spock's home planet. Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) In Star Trek Into Darkness, Spock Prime is described as living on 'New Vulcan' while the younger Spock remains aboard the Enterprise struggling with the loss of his homeworld, as well as his relationships with Uhura and James T. Kirk. Spock nearly dies protecting a planet from an active volcano, but Kirk breaks the Prime Directive and saves him. Spock Prime is contacted by Spock on the Enterprise, to find out details on Khan. Spock Prime initially reminds his alternate self that he will not interfere with the events in the alternate timeline. That being said, he then informs Spock that Khan was a dangerous man, and the greatest threat that the Enterprise ever faced in his own timeline, and warns that he is likely as dangerous in Spock's alternate timeline as well. When asked whether Khan was defeated, Spock Prime answers that he eventually was defeated, but at great cost (referring to the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). When Kirk contracts radiation poisoning and dies in front of Spock (a transposed parallel of events in the prime timeline where Spock dies in front of Kirk), an enraged Spock attempts to kill Khan to avenge Kirk before Uhura informs him that Khan's regenerative blood can revive Kirk. Nearly a year later, Spock remains as Kirk's chief science officer and executive officer as the Enterprise departs on its first five-year mission of deep-space exploration. Into Darkness would be Nimoy's final appearance as Spock Prime, as well as the last role of his career. He died in 2015, shortly before production began on Star Trek Beyond. Star Trek Beyond (2016) In Star Trek Beyond, Spock receives word that Ambassador Spock (Spock Prime) has died. Impacted by this, Spock later tells McCoy that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue the ambassador's work on New Vulcan. At the end of the film, Spock receives a box containing some of Ambassador Spock's personal effects, and reflecting on a photograph of the older crew of the Enterprise from the series' original timeline, he chooses to remain in Starfleet. =Star Trek: Discovery= In August 2018 it was announced that Ethan Peck would join the cast of Star Trek: Discovery as Spock in the show's second season, portraying a Spock younger than both Nimoy's and Quinto's renditions of the character, as Discovery is set several years before the Original Series and Kelvin Timeline films. As of his appearances on Discovery, Spock is a Lieutenant, serving under Captain Christopher Pike on the Enterprise. Due to the trauma Spock suffered because of his visions of the \\"Red Angel\\", he is on leave from the Enterprise and under psychiatric care. His adopted sister Michael Burnham is attempting to help him recover. =Star Trek: Short Treks= In 2019, it was announced that the character Spock, as played by Peck would appear in two Star Trek: Short Treks, along with Captain Pike. = Star Trek: Strange New Worlds = In May 2020, it was announced that Spock (Ethan Peck), would return in the series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds alongside Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and Number One / Una (Rebecca Romjin). Development =The Original Series= The earliest known mention of Spock was in a conversation between Star Treks creator Gene Roddenberry and actor Gary Lockwood, in which Lockwood suggested Leonard Nimoy for the role. The trio had previously worked together on Roddenberry's The Lieutenant in the episode \\"In the Highest Tradition\\". Roddenberry agreed to the idea, but was required to audition other actors for the part. At the time, Roddenberry sought DeForest Kelley to play the doctor character in the pilot, \\"The Cage\\", but both NBC executives and director Robert Butler wanted him to play Spock. Roddenberry offered the part to both Kelley and Martin Landau, but they both turned him down. When offered, Nimoy accepted the part but was apprehensive about the make-up which had not been determined at that point. During an interview segment of TV Land's 40th Anniversary Star Trek Marathon on November 12, 2006 Leonard Nimoy stated that Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Spock was George Lindsey. Because of the flippant way Nimoy makes the comment it has been suggested that he was joking. The claim Lindsey was offered the role is given more credibility when Lindsey's close friend Ernest Borgnine writes in his autobiography, \\"my hand to God ‚Äì he turned down the part of Mr. Spock on TV's Star Trek, the role that made Leonard Nimoy famous.\\" Nimoy as Spock in 1967 The character evolved from having a metal plate in his stomach through which he ingested energy to being a half-Martian in the original 1964 pitch with a \\"slightly reddish complexion and semi-pointed ears\\". Due to Roddenberry's concern that a Mars landing might take place before the end of the series, Spock's home planet was changed. Lee Greenway conducted the initial makeup tests on Nimoy, but after four or five days, Fred Phillips was asked to take over. Phillips in turn asked John Chambers to create Spock's ears, as he was working on getting an appropriate shade of red for Spock's skin; this idea was later abandoned in favor of a yellow hue because of the effects on black and white television. Nimoy hated the ears, and Roddenberry promised him that if he was still unhappy by the 13th episode then they'd find a way to write them out. The NBC executives were also concerned, as they felt it made the character satanic. At Roddenberry's insistence, Spock was the only character retained for the second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". However, NBC demanded that he be only a background character, and when it went to series, the tips of Spock's ears were airbrushed out on promotional materials. It was during early episodes such as \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" and \\"The Naked Time\\" that Nimoy came to understand the nature of the character. After eight episodes, NBC executives complained to Roddenberry that there was not enough Spock in the series ‚Äì \\"Spockmania\\" had begun. In response, Spock was moved to a more prominent role within the series, such as taking the lead role in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" over Sulu. The popularity of the character caused frictions with Shatner, and rumours spread that he was going to be dropped from the show and replaced as the lead by Nimoy as Spock. A drawn out contract renegotiation at the start of season two resulted in Roddenberry considering whether or not to replace Nimoy and the character. Both Mark Lenard and Lawrence Montaigne were seriously considered. The character continued to develop, with Nimoy creating the Vulcan salute during the filming of \\"Amok Time\\". This was based on a Jewish Kohen he had seen as a child. During the course of the season, a rift grew between Nimoy and Roddenberry and by the end of the year, they only spoke through formal letters. After the departure of producer Gene L. Coon and the stepping back of Roddenberry during the third season, Nimoy found that the writing of Spock deteriorated. In particular, he did not like the character being made a fool of during the episode \\"Spock's Brain\\". The interracial kiss between Kirk and Uhura in \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" had been intended by the writers to be between Spock and Uhura, but Shatner persuaded them to change it. For his role as Spock, Leonard Nimoy was nominated three times Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and is currently the only Star Trek actor to be nominated for an Emmy. =Revival attempts and the film franchise= Zachary Quinto was cast as Spock for the 2009 Star Trek film. Nimoy agreed to return to Spock during one of the early 1970s attempts to create a Star Trek film, entitled Star Trek: The God Thing, but dropped out after his likeness as Spock was used without permission to advertise Heineken beer. He was persuaded to return to the role of Spock as the lead for the planned Trek film titled Planet of the Titans to be directed by Philip Kaufman. When this project was killed in favor of a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II, Nimoy was reportedly just offered only a recurring part by Roddenberry, so refused to appear at all. When the decision was made to turn the TV pilot script into Star Trek: The Motion Picture, director Robert Wise insisted Nimoy to return as the character, which was only accomplished by Jeffrey Katzenberg forcing Paramount to settle the dispute with Nimoy over licensing use of his image. As on the series, Nimoy, calling on method acting training, would often not break character between takes. Dissatisfied with the first Trek feature, Nimoy was reluctant to return for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan by the promise of a dramatic death scene. Nimoy enjoyed the production of the film so much that despite his character's on-screen death he wanted to return for a sequel. The film's success allowed Nimoy to successfully negotiate to direct the next installment in addition to briefly appearing as a reanimated Spock. The resulting film, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock was successful enough that Nimoy was asked to direct once more for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The following film of the series, the William Shatner-directed Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was initially unacceptable to Nimoy because it called for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his newly introduced half-brother Sybok. Nimoy felt his character had already come to terms with his human-side thus Sybok would have no influence on him, and forced the script to be changed before signing on. Nimoy subsequently organized Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, choosing the director, writers and producers. To hand over to Star Trek: The Next Generation at the time of The Undiscovered Country, Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode \\"Unification\\". Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on Star Trek Generations as he wanted to rework the script, and refused reprising the role of Spock for what was essentially a cameo appearance; and his character's lines were subsequently given to Scotty. When recasting the role for 2009's Star Trek, Nimoy was asked his opinion. He highlighted the work of Zachary Quinto, as he felt he looked similar and could portray the inner thought process of the character. Quinto became the first actor to be cast for the film, and Nimoy agreed to return as the version of the character from the \\"Prime\\" universe. Nimoy said that he returned because of the enthusiasm from director J.J. Abrams and the writers, and because it made him feel appreciated. Nimoy made a final appearance as Spock in Star Trek Into Darkness as a favor to Abrams. At the time, he did not rule out returning again, but he died prior to the following film. In Star Trek Beyond, Quinto's Spock mourns the loss of Spock Prime, as played by Nimoy. Mind melds Spock is one of the characters of Star Trek known to conduct the universe's Vulcan aliens signature mind melds. Examples: * \\"Dagger of the Mind\\" (TOS) * \\"The Devil in the Dark\\" * \\"Spectre of the Gun\\" * \\"One of Our Planets Is Missing\\" (TAS) * Star Trek: The Motion Picture * Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country * Star Trek (2009 film) Reception \\"Given the choice\\", Nimoy said years after the show ended, \\"If I had to be someone else, I would be Spock.\\" He recalled, more than a decade after the show's cancellation: From early on, the public reacted very positively‚Äîeven fanatically‚Äîto his character, in what The Boston Globe in 1967 described as \\"Spockmania\\". Headshots of Spock became popular souvenirs, with the rare ones of the actor laughing the most valuable. Nimoy reported that \\"within two weeks after [\\"Amok Time\\"], my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week\\". When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: \\"They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand so hard it began to sway beneath my feet!\\" After being rescued by police, \\"I made sure never to appear publicly again in Vulcan guise\\", Nimoy stated. Fans asked Nimoy questions about current events such as the Vietnam War and LSD as if he were the Vulcan scientist; one even asked the actor to lay his hands on a friend's eyes to heal them. When a biracial girl wrote asking for advice on how to deal with persecution as \\"a half-breed\\", Nimoy responded that young Vulcans had treated Spock similarly and that she should, as he did, \\"realize the difference between popularity and true greatness\\". The actor believed that the character appealed to viewers, especially teenagers, because To Nimoy's surprise, Spock became a sex symbol; Isaac Asimov described the character as \\"a security blanket with sexual overtones\\", and Nimoy reported that \\"I've never had more female attention on a set before. And get this: they all want to touch the ears!\\" (When a young woman asked \\"Are you aware that you are the source of erotic dream material for thousands and thousands of ladies around the world?\\", he replied \\"May all your dreams come true\\".) Nimoy speculated that Spock appealed to women because NASA made Spock an informal mascot. Nimoy was invited to be guest of honor at the March 1967 National Space Club dinner and to take an extensive tour of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The actor concluded from the warm and intense reception he received that astronauts like John Glenn and aerospace industry engineers, secretaries, and shareholders alike all regarded Star Trek, and especially the character of Spock, as a \\"dramatization of the future of their space program\\". An asteroid in the Eos family discovered on August 16, 1971 was named Mr. Spock after the discoverer James B. Gibson's cat (which had been named Mr. Spock, who was likewise \\"imperturbable, logical, intelligent, and had pointed ears\\"). The character proved inspirational to many budding scientists and engineers. Nimoy has said that many of them, on meeting him, were eager to show him their work and discuss it with him as if he were a scientific peer, as opposed to an actor, photographer, and poet. His stock response in these situations was \\"it certainly looks like you're headed in the right direction\\". In 2004, Spock was ranked number 21 in Bravo's list of The 100 Greatest TV Characters. In 2008, UGO named Spock one of the 50 greatest TV characters. According to Shatner, much of Star Treks acting praise and media interest went to Nimoy. In 2012, IGN ranked the character Spock, as depicted in the original series and the 2009 film Star Trek, as the second top character of the Star Trek universe, with Kirk in the top spot. In 2016, Adam Nimoy released his documentary film For the Love of Spock, about his father and his iconic character. In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Spock the 5th most attractive person in the Star Trek universe, in between Michael Burnham and Seven of Nine. In 2018, they ranked Spock as one of the top 8 most powerful characters of Star Trek (including later series). In 2018, CBR ranked Spock the 6th best Starfleet character of the Star Trek franchise. =Reaction to Spock's death= The Wrath of Khan had its first public screening at a science-fiction convention in Overland Park, Kansas on May 8, 1982, almost a month before general release. Although Paramount executives were concerned that Spock's death would set fans against the movie, the audience actually applauded after Spock's death scene. \\"It was sensational. I hate to be given to superlatives but it absolutely reached everything we wanted it to. I couldn't ask for anything better,\\" said co-producer Robert Sallin of the advance audience's reaction. Critical reaction to Spock's death was mixed. Film critic Roger Ebert lauded Spock's death: \\"He makes a choice in Star Trek II that would be made only by a hero, a fool, or a Vulcan. And when he makes his decision, the movie rises to one of its best scenes, because the Star Trek stories have always been best when they centered on their characters.\\" On the other hand, The Washington Posts Gary Arnold stated Spock's death \\"feels like an unnecessary twist, and the filmmakers are obviously well-prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel.\\" Twenty-five years later, Spock's death in The Wrath of Khan ranks number 2 on Total Film's list of 25 greatest Star Trek movie moments, and number 1 on IGN Movie's top 10 Star Trek movie moments. =Star Trek (2009)= Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described Quinto's performance in the 2009 film as \\"something special\\", and stated that Nimoy's appearance \\"carries much more emotion than you'd expect\\". Slate said Quinto played Spock \\"with a few degrees more chill\\" than Nimoy brought to the original character. Entertainment Weekly said that Quinto \\"... invests Spock with a new layer of chilly-smoldering sex appeal, [and] Quinto does a fantastic job of maintaining Spock's calm, no-sweat surface but getting quietly hot and bothered underneath.\\" Cultural impact Spock has been parodied by, and has also been the inspiration for, pop culture works in various media. Composer/keyboardist George Duke's 1976 Solo Keyboard Album features two tracks which pay homage to Spock: \\"Spock Gets Funky\\" and \\"Vulcan Mind Probe\\". Rock guitarist Paul Gilbert wrote the song \\"Mr. Spock\\" on his Space Ship One album. Swedish synthpop band S.P.O.C.K makes music heavily influenced by the Star Trek universe. Even Nimoy got in on the act; assuming the Spock character, Nimoy recorded a number of novelty songs, the first being \\"Highly Illogical\\", in which Spock pointed out the foibles of human thought, such as relationships, automobiles, and greed. The second song, \\"A Visit to a Sad Planet\\", was darker in tone and told the story of Spock visiting Earth in the future and discovering it had been ruined by war, violence, and environmental irresponsibility. According to comic book writer and editor Bob Budiansky, The Transformers character Shockwave was inspired by Spock. Spock's utilitarian perspective that \\"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" is cited in a legal decision rendered by the Texas Supreme Court.Robinson v. Crown Cork & Seal, Supreme Court of Texas No. 06-0714 (2008). online.wsj.com i.e. The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved March 3, 2015 Leonard Nimoy's second-season Spock costume shirt was expected to sell at auction for over $75,000. Spock's physical appearance in the Original Series episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" (1967) has itself spawned a trope of the \\"evil twin\\" archetype found in various fictional genres. In that episode, several members of the Enterprise travel to a parallel universe inhabited by evil versions of themselves. The parallel universe version of Spock is distinguished physically by his goatee. Science fiction blog io9 said that Spock's beard in the episode introduced \\"the best shorthand ever for evil parallel universe duplicates\\". Examples of the evil goatee's appearances in other media include Bender's \\"evil twin\\" Flexo in Futurama and a 2009 episode of The Colbert Report featuring Stephen Colbert and Dan Maffei wearing fake goatees while pretending to be evil versions of themselves. The name of progressive rock band Spock's Beard is a direct reference to Spock's goatee in this episode. =Fan productions= In addition to television, feature films, books, and parodies, Spock has also been portrayed in non-canon fan fiction. Since 2004, the online fan production Star Trek: Phase II has continued the further voyages of the cancelled initial series. The fan-series' creators feel \\"Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest should be treated as 'classic' characters like Willy Loman from Death of a Salesman, Gandalf from Lord of the Rings, or even Hamlet, Othello, or Romeo. Many actors have and can play the roles, each offering a different interpretation of said character.\\" The fan series Star Trek: Phase II has featured three actors in the role of Spock. Spock was portrayed by Jeffrey Quinn for the pilot and first three episodes, by Ben Tolpin in episodes 4 and 5, and by Brandon Stacy in episodes 6 through 11. Stacy also served as a stand-in for Zachary Quinto in the 2009 Star Trek film. The independent online fan series Star Trek Continues featured Todd Haberkorn as Spock in three vignettes and eleven full episodes between 2013 and 2017. In scientific illustrator Jenny Parks' 2017 book Star Trek Cats, Spock is depicted as an Oriental Shorthair. =\\"Spocking\\" Canadian $5 notes= There has been a practice of altering the portrait of Wilfrid Laurier, Canada's prime minister from 1896 to 1911, on Canadian five-dollar notes to look like Spock.

She was best known for her roles as Nurse Christine Chapel in the original Star Trek series and Lwaxana Troi on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, as well as for being the voice of most onboard computer interfaces throughout the series. She became the second wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. As the wife of Roddenberry and given her ongoing relationship with Star Trek‚Äîparticipating in some way in every series during her lifetime‚Äîshe was sometimes referred to as \\"the First Lady of Star Trek\\". Early life Barrett was born in Cleveland, Ohio. She began taking acting classes as a child. She attended Shaker Heights High School, graduating in 1950 before going on to the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, then had some stage roles and came to Hollywood. Her father, William Hudec, was a Cleveland police officer. He was killed in the line of duty on August 30, 1955ODMP: William Hudec. Viewed 2014-12-06. while Barrett was touring with an off-Broadway road company. Career Barrett was briefly seen in Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957) in an ad parody at the beginning of the film, and had roles in a few movies, including Love in a Goldfish Bowl (1961), Sylvia (1965), A Guide for the Married Man (1967), and Track of Thunder (1967). She worked at the Desilu Studios on several TV shows, including Bonanza, The Untouchables, The Lucy Show, and The Lieutenant (produced by Gene Roddenberry). She received training in comedy from Lucille Ball. In 1960, she played Gwen Rutherford on Leave It to Beaver. =Star Trek= In various roles, Barrett participated in every incarnation of the popular science fiction Star Trek franchise produced during her lifetime, including live-action and animated versions, television and cinema, and all of the time periods in which the various series have been set. She first appeared in Star Treks initial pilot, \\"The Cage\\" (1964), as the USS Enterprises unnamed first officer, \\"Number One\\". Barrett was romantically involved with Roddenberry, whose marriage was on the verge of failing at the time, and the idea of having an otherwise unknown woman in a leading role just because she was the producer's girlfriend is said to have infuriated NBC network executives who insisted that Roddenberry give the role to a man. William Shatner corroborated this in Star Trek Memories, and added that female viewers at test screenings hated the character as well.Star Trek Memories, dictated by William Shatner and transcribed by Chris Kreski, which HarperCollins published, with the , in 1993, made this claim in the chapter on \\"The Cage\\". Shatner noted that female viewers felt she was \\"pushy\\" and \\"annoying\\" and also thought that \\"Number One shouldn't be trying so hard to fit in with the men.\\"William Shatner, Star Trek Memories, Harper Collins, 1993. p.65 Barrett often joked that Roddenberry, given the choice between keeping Mr. Spock (whom the network also hated) or the woman character, \\"kept the Vulcan and married the woman, 'cause he didn't think Leonard [Nimoy] would have it the other way around.\\" When Roddenberry was casting for the second Star Trek pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", she changed her last name from Hudec to Barrett and wore a blonde wig for the role of nurse Christine Chapel, a frequently recurring character, who was introduced in \\"The Naked Time\\", the sixth new episode recorded, and was known for her unrequited affection for the dispassionate Spock. Her first appearance as Chapel in film dailies prompted NBC executive Jerry Stanley to yodel \\"Well, well‚Äîlook who's back!\\". In an early scene in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, viewers are informed that she has now become Doctor Chapel, a role which she reprised briefly in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, as Commander Chapel. Barrett provided several voices for Star Trek: The Animated Series, including those of Nurse Chapel and a communications officer named M'Ress, an ailuroid officer who served alongside Uhura. Barrett returned years later in Star Trek: The Next Generation, cast as the outrageously self-assertive, iconoclastic, Betazoid ambassador, Lwaxana Troi, who appeared as a recurring character in the series. Her character often vexed the captain of the Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard, who spurned her amorous advances. She later appeared as Ambassador Troi in several episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, where her character developed a strong relationship with Constable Odo. She provided the regular voice of the onboard computers of Federation starships for Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, and most of the Star Trek movies. She reprised her role as a shipboard computer's voice in two episodes of the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise, thus making her the only actor to have a role in all six televised Star Trek series produced up to that time. She also lent her voice to various computer games and software related to the franchise. The association of her voice with interactions with computers led to Google's Assistant project being initially codenamed Google Majel. Barrett had also made a point of attending a major Star Trek convention each year in an effort to inspire fans and keep the franchise alive. On December 9, 2008, less than ten days before her death, Roddenberry Productions announced that she would be providing the voice of the ship's computer once again, this time for the 2009 motion picture reboot of Star Trek.Roddenberry Productions press release, December 11, 2008. Retrieved December 18, 2008. Sean Rossall, a Roddenberry family spokesman, stated that she had already completed the voiceover work, around December 4, 2008. The film is dedicated to Roddenberry and Barrett. =Other roles= She appeared as Primus Dominic in Roddenberry's 1973 postapocalyptic TV drama pilot, Genesis II; as Dr. Bradley in his 1974 TV movie The Questor Tapes and as Lilith the housekeeper in his 1977 TV drama pilot, Spectre. She also appeared in Michael Crichton's 1973 sci-fi Western, Westworld as Miss Carrie, a robot brothel madam; the 1977 Stanley Kramer thriller The Domino Principle; and the 1979 TV movie The Man in the Santa Claus Suit starring Fred Astaire. Her later film appearances included small roles in Teresa's Tattoo (1994) and Mommy (1995). After Gene Roddenberry's death, Barrett took material from his archives to bring two of his ideas into production. She was executive producer of Earth: Final Conflict (in which she also played the character Dr. Julianne Belman), and Andromeda. She also served as creative director for Gene Roddenberry's Lost Universe, a comic book series based on another archival Roddenberry concept. In a gesture of goodwill between the creators of the Star Trek franchise and of Babylon 5 (some of whose fans viewed them as rivals),Ntua.gr she appeared in the Babylon 5 episode \\"Point of No Return\\", as Lady Morella, the psychic widow of the Centauri emperor, a role which foreshadowed major plot elements in the series. Parodying her voice work as the computer for the Star Trek series, Barrett performed as a guest voice on Family Guy as the voice of Stewie Griffin's ship's computer in the episode \\"Emission Impossible\\". Barrett's widely recognized voice performance as the Star Trek computer inspired the Amazon Alexa interactive virtual assistant, according to its developer Toni Reid, although Barrett had no direct role in it. =Railroad voicework= The Southern Pacific Railroad used her voice talent contained inside Harmon Electronics (of Grain Valley, MO) track-side defect detector devices, used in various locations west of the Mississippi River. When a defect is identified on the passing train, the system responds with her recorded voice announcing the defect location information to the train crew over the radio. In railroad forums and railroad radio monitoring groups, she was and is still referred to as the \\"SP Lady\\". However, with the implementation of newer hotbox detector technology, finding her voice today on working detectors is very rare. The hotbox detectors that had her voice installed in them were not upgradeable to the newer digital signaling requirements, and finding parts for them was difficult. Today, her voice is found on smaller regional railroads, usually only at dragging equipment locations, such as in California at milepost 24.6 on the Metrolink Lancaster line (under the I-5 and I-210 interchange in Sylmar), and in Oregon on the Portland & Western at milepost 746.5, near Lake Oswego. These voiced detectors remain because the lines were once owned by Southern Pacific, and because only two unchanging recorded messages are used, compared to the dynamic changing library used in hotbox detectors. The only major railroad that still uses her voice today is Union Pacific. =Final voiceover work= Some of Barrett's final voiceover work was still in post- production, to be released in 2009 after her death, as mentioned in the credits of the 2009 movie Star Trek, again as the voice of the Enterprise computer. An animated production called Hamlet A.D.D. credited her as Majel Barrett Roddenberry, playing the voiceover role of Queen Robot. Personal life and death Barrett and son Rod in 2008 In 1969, while scouting locations in Japan for MGM,Engel (1994): p. 139 Roddenberry claimed that he realized that he missed Barrett and proposed to her by telephone. In the version recited by Herbert F. Solow, Roddenberry traveled to Japan with the intention of marrying Barrett. She had a passport and joined Roddenberry in Tokyo, where they were married in a Shinto ceremony on August 6, 1969.Alexander (1995): p. 370 Roddenberry had considered it \\"sacrilegious\\" to use an American minister in Japan, and the ceremony was attended by two Shinto priests as well as maids of honor. Roddenberry and Barrett both wore kimonos, and spent their honeymoon touring Japan. He continued to have liaisons with other women, telling his friends that while in Japan he had an encounter with a masseuse about a week after he was married.Engel (1994): p. 140 The new marriage was not legally binding, as his divorce from Eileen had not yet been finalized. This was resolved two days after his divorce was complete, and on December 29, a small ceremony was held at their home followed by a reception for family and friends. Despite this, the couple continued to celebrate August 6 as their wedding anniversary. His young daughter, Dawn, decided to live with him and Barrett,Alexander (1995): p. 372 and together they moved to a new house in Beverly Hills during the following October.Alexander (1995): p. 377 Roddenberry and Barrett had a son together, Eugene Jr., commonly referred to as Rod Roddenberry, in February 1974.Van Hise (1992): p. 53 They remained married for the rest of Roddenberry's life, and Roddenberry died by Barrett's side on October 24, 1991, at a doctor's office in Santa Monica, California.Alexander (1995): p. 7 After Gene Roddenberry died in 1991, Majel Barrett-Roddenberry commissioned Celestis to launch her together with Gene on an infinite mission to deepest space.

For example, to improve memory through passive review, an individual may read a text today; to not forget it, it is repeated tomorrow and then 4 days later and then 8, 16, 32, 64, etc., days later. They don't ask themselves to explain the content of the text, but only reread the content. If they think to recall something, they are more likely to keep it in their memory. A passive review strategy includes music as an accompaniment. Particularly, the learner listens to Baroque music playing in the background while rhythmically repeating key material. Passive review can also be combined with other learning strategy to further enhance outcomes. For instance, the so-called Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching Techniques (SALTT) alternate it with active recall and are complemented by physical relaxation exercise, and cooperative learning, among others. Passive review is a simple method but it is not as effective. Active recall is more complicated and difficult (because it forces one to recall something) but it is highly effective.

Heinlein, published in 1987. It was the last novel published before his death in 1988. The title is taken from the poem Ulysses, by Alfred Lord Tennyson. The stanza of which it is a part, quoted by a character in the novel, is as follows: > ... my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the > western stars, until I die. It is the final part of the \\"Lazarus Long\\" cycle of stories, involving time travel, parallel dimensions, free love, voluntary incest, and a concept that Heinlein named pantheistic solipsism, or 'World as Myth': the theory that universes are created by the act of imagining them, so that somewhere (for example) the Land of Oz is real. Other books in the cycle include Methuselah's Children, Time Enough for Love, The Number of the Beast, and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. Plot The book is a memoir of Maureen Johnson Smith Long, mother, lover, and eventual wife of Lazarus Long. Maureen is ostensibly recording the events of the book while held in prison alongside Pixel, the eponymous character of The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. Maureen, born on July 4, 1882, recounts her girlhood in backcountry Missouri, discovery that her family is a member of the long-lived Howard Families (whose backstory is revealed in Methuselah's Children), marriage to Brian Smith, another member of that group, and her life‚Äîlargely in Kansas City‚Äîuntil her apparent death in 1982. In addition, Maureen lives through, and gives her (sometimes contradictory) viewpoints on many events in other Heinlein stories, most notably the 1917 visit from the future by \\"Ted Bronson\\" (Lazarus Long), told from Long's point of view in Time Enough for Love, D. D. Harriman's space program from The Man Who Sold the Moon, and the rolling roads from The Roads Must Roll. Maureen's adventures include a series of sexual encounters, beginning in childhood wherein, having just had her first sexual intercourse, she is examined by her father, a doctor, and finds herself desiring him sexually. Her story then encompasses various boys, her husband, ministers, other women's husbands, boyfriends, swinging sessions, and the adult Lazarus Long/Theodore Bronson. Additionally, she continues a lifelong pursuit of her father sexually, encourages her husband to have sexual intercourse with their daughters, and accompanies him when he does; but forbids a son and daughter of hers from continuing an incestuous relationship, primarily for the sister's reluctance to share the brother with other women.The Heinlein Society All of these are set against a history lesson of an alternate 20th century in which a variety of social and philosophical commentary is delivered. She is eventually rescued from prison by Lazarus Long and other characters of various novels in the ship Gay Deceiver (from The Number of the Beast), and after rescuing her father from certain death in the Battle of Britain, is united with her descendants in a massive group marriage in the settlement of Boondock, on the planet Tertius. Maureen ends her memoir and the Lazarus Long saga with the phrase \\"And we all lived happily ever after\\". References External links  1987 American novels Novels by Robert A. Heinlein G. P.

Heinlein, first serialized in Astounding Science Fiction (February, March, and April 1956) and published in hardcover the same year. It received the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first). Plot summary The novel is set in the future, when the Moon, Mars, Venus and Jupiter's satellites have been colonized and the solar system is governed by a parliamentary democracy from a capitol city on the Moon. The indigenous alien race inhabiting Mars has recently been admitted to citizenship in the human-dominated solar system government. The story, which is told in the first person, centers on down-and- out actor Lawrence Smith (stage name Lorenzo Smythe, also known as \\"The Great Lorenzo\\"). A brilliant actor and mimic, he is down to his last coin when a spaceman hires him to double for an unspecified public figure. It is only when he is on his way to Mars that he finds out he will have to impersonate one of the most prominent politicians in the Solar System (and one with whose views Smith deeply disagrees): John Joseph Bonforte. Bonforte is the leader of the Expansionist coalition, currently out of office but with a good chance of changing that at the next general election. Bonforte has been kidnapped by his political opponents, and his aides want Smith to impersonate Bonforte while they try to find him. Bonforte is rescued, but he is in poor health due to the treatment inflicted on him during his imprisonment. This forces Smith to extend his performance, even to becoming temporary Prime Minister and running in an election. (This is made plausible through Bonforte's extensive Farley files.) The central political issue in the election is the granting of the vote to Martians in the human-dominated Solar System. Lorenzo shares the anti- Martian prejudice prevalent among large parts of Earth's population, but he is called upon to assume the persona of the most prominent advocate for Martian enfranchisement. Smith takes on not only Bonforte's appearance, but some aspects of his personality. Cover of Astounding Science Fiction that carried the first segment of the serialized novel in February 1956 At the moment of electoral victory, Bonforte dies of the aftereffects of his kidnapping, and Smith assumes the role for life. In a retrospective conclusion set twenty-five years later, Smith reveals that he wrote the first-person narrative as therapy. Smith has become Bonforte, suppressing his own identity permanently. He has been generally successful and has carried forward Bonforte's ideals to the best of his ability. Penny (Bonforte's adoring secretary and now Smith's wife) says, \\"she never loved anyone else.\\"  Critical reception  The noted science-fiction writer and critic James Blish was no fan of Heinlein's treatment of his first-person protagonists in a number of his novels. Writing in 1957, however, Blish says that \\"The only first-person narrator Heinlein has created who is a living, completely independent human being is The Great Lorenzo of Double Star. Lorenzo is complete all the way back to his childhood‚Äîthe influence of his father upon what he thinks is one of the strongest motives in the story‚Äîand his growth under pressure is consistent with his character and no-one else's.\\"James Blish, The Issues at Hand, pp. 53-54. Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, finding it \\"an excellent example of Heinlein's ability to take one of the oldest plots in any literature ... and present it as an enjoyable reading experience.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, September 1955, p. 110 Admitting \\"a certain reservation, even disappointment,\\" Anthony Boucher nevertheless concluded that Heinlein was \\"simply creating an agreeably entertaining light novel, and in that task he succeeds admirably.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, June 1956, p. 101. At the 1957 Worldcon it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel (his first) of the previous year. In 2012, the novel was selected for inclusion in the Library of America two-volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe. Political system The political system depicted in the book is a constitutional monarchy, with the House of Orange elevated to the role of providing an Emperor of the Solar System, while the Monarchs of other dynasties became courtiers at the Imperial court. The Emperor reigns (but does not rule) from a palace on the Moon, with the real power in the hands of a First Minister, who must command the support of the Grand Assembly. Elections for the Assembly are held as in a Parliamentary system ‚Äî there is an upper time limit (five years) between elections, but they can be called more frequently if the First Minister so decides, or if he is forced to it by the loss of a vote of confidence. ‚Äî The United States is mentioned as initially having an unspecified associate status, and later obtaining full membership. In the system, the U.S. maintains full internal autonomy and is obviously a powerful voice in Empire affairs; Bonforte himself is an American. The legislative power rests with the Grand Assembly, which also meets on the Moon (where the Imperial bureaucracy is located), most members representing an area of Earth or another planet, with other members representing constituencies not tied to any geographic place; one represents space pilots, for instance, and another districtless university women. As in the British system, representatives need not live in their district or be an actual member of the non-geographical constituency. Candidates for safe seats are determined by the central party office. At the time depicted in the novel, Venusians may vote in elections for representatives - their vote determined mainly by subtle philosophical differences incomprehensible to humans - while Martians do not have the vote, and extraterrestrials of any kind are not permitted to be members of the Assembly. Bonforte has pledged himself to remove this exclusion. An afterword makes clear that he eventually does so, his party subsequently loses power but the change remains and he eventually makes a comeback and becomes prime minister again. The names of the two contending main parties - the Humanity Party and the Expansionist Party - were evidently chosen by Heinlein to make readers avoid jumping to hasty conclusions. At first glance, judging from the names, the Humanity Party could be expected to be the more progressive of the two. In fact, however, the Humanity Party is the party of human supremacists while the Expansionist Party favors expanding rights to include other intelligent species. Cover controversy The cover illustration for a 1970s UK edition of Double Star (artist: Anthony Roberts) was the subject of an unlikely controversy when it was used as the basis of an entry for the 2000 Turner Prize for modern art. The artist in question, Glenn Brown, was accused of plagiarism.

Heinlein, published by Scribner's in 1956 as one of the Heinlein juveniles. The basic plot line is derived from a 1911 thought experiment in special relativity, commonly called the twin paradox, proposed by French physicist Paul Langevin. Plot summary The Long Range Foundation (LRF) is a non-profit organization that funds expensive, long-term projects for the benefit of mankind. It has built a dozen exploratory torchships to search for habitable planets to colonize. The vessels can continually accelerate, but cannot exceed the speed of light, so the voyages will last many years. Each starship has a much larger crew than necessary to maintain a more stable, long-term shipboard society, as well as provide replacements for the inevitable deaths. It is found that some twins and triplets can communicate with each other telepathically. The process seems to be instantaneous and unaffected by distance, making it the only practical means of communication for ships traveling many light years away from Earth. Before announcing the discovery, the foundation first recruits as many of these people as it can. Testing shows that teenagers Tom and Pat Bartlett have this talent and both sign up. Pat, the dominant twin, manipulates things so that he gets selected as the crew member, much to Tom's annoyance. However, Pat does not really want to leave and his subconscious engineers a convenient accident so that Tom has to take his place at the last minute. On board, Tom is pleased to find that his uncle Steve, a military man, has arranged to get assigned to the same ship. The trip is fraught with problems as trivial as an annoying roommate and as serious as mutiny. The ship visits several star systems, including Beta Hydri. Due to the nature of relativistic travel (see Twin paradox), the twin who remained behind ages faster and eventually the affinity between them is weakened to the point that they can no longer communicate easily. Some of the spacefaring twins, including the protagonist, are able to connect with descendants of the Earthbound twins. Tom works first with his niece, then his grandniece, and finally his great-grandniece. The last planet scouted proves to be particularly deadly. Unexpectedly intelligent and hostile natives capture and kill a large portion of the remaining crew, including the captain and Tom's uncle. The reserve captain takes charge, but is unable to restore the morale of the devastated survivors. When he insists on continuing the mission rather than returning to Earth, members of the crew begin to consider mutiny. Shortly after he notifies Earth of the dire situation, they are surprised to hear a spaceship will rendezvous with them in less than a month and surmise it must be a more advanced LRF spaceship. Scientists on Earth have discovered faster-than-light travel, in part due to research into the nature of telepathy, and are collecting the surviving crews of the LRF torchships. The explorers return to an Earth they no longer recognize, and in most cases, no longer fit in. Tom, however, returns to marry his latest telepathic partner, his own great-grandniece, who has been reading his mind since she was a child. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as \\"an engrossing yarn\\", saying \\"The plot twists will take you by surprise and the characterizations delight you.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, May 1957, p.122-23 References External links  1956 science fiction novels 1956 American novels American science fiction novels American young adult novels Beta Hydri in fiction Children's science fiction novels Novels by Robert A.

Heinlein, originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction (September, October, November, December 1957) and published in hardcover in 1957 as one of the Heinlein juveniles by Scribner's. The story is heavily influenced by Rudyard Kipling's Kim. Plot summary The novel is set in the future when the human race has developed interstellar spaceflight and is engaged in trade with a number of alien races. However human slavery has reappeared on some planets. The Hegemonic Guard, the space military force of the human government, enforces the law and fights the slave trade on frontier planets. Thorby is a young, defiant boy who is purchased at a slave auction on the planet Jubbul by an old beggar, Baslim the Cripple, for a trivial sum and taken to the beggar's surprisingly well-furnished underground home. Thereafter, Baslim treats the boy as a son, teaching him not only the trade of begging, but also mathematics, history, and several languages, while sending Thorby on errands all over the city. Thorby slowly realizes that his foster father is not a simple beggar, but is gathering intelligence, particularly on the slave trade. In addition, Baslim has Thorby memorize a contingency plan and a message to deliver to one of five starship captains in the event of Baslim's arrest or death. When Baslim commits suicide to avoid being captured alive by the local authorities, Thorby delivers the message to Captain Krausa of the starship Sisu. Because the \\"Free Traders\\", to whom Krausa belongs, owe a debt to Baslim for the rescue of one of their crews from a slaver, the captain takes Thorby aboard at great risk to himself and his clan. The Free Traders are an insular, clannish, matriarchal culture who live their lives in space, traveling from world to world trading. Thorby is adopted by the captain (thereby gaining considerable shipboard social status) and adjusts to the culture of the traders, learning their language and intricate social rules. The advanced education provided by Baslim and the fast reflexes of youth make him an ideal fire controlman; Thorby saves Sisu, destroying a pirate craft. His immediate superior, a young woman named Mata, begins to view him as husband material, tabu by Free Trader custom, so she is transferred to another ship. The captain's wife, who is also the executive officer and the head of the clan, wants to use Thorby's connection to Baslim to enhance Sisu's prestige by marrying him off. Captain Krausa, however, obeys Baslim's last wish by delivering the boy to a military cruiser of the Hegemonic Guard of the Terran Hegemony, the dominant military power in the galaxy. The captain, who was one of Baslim's couriers, passes along Baslim's request that the Guard help reunite Thorby with his family, if possible. Thorby discovers that Baslim was actually a colonel in the Hegemonic Guard who volunteered to spy on Jubbul to fight slavery. In order to avoid paying for a costly background search, Thorby agrees to enlist in the Hegemonic Guard. Thorby is ultimately identified as Thor Bradley Rudbek, the long-lost primary heir of a very powerful, extremely wealthy family, which controls Rudbek and Associates, a large, sprawling interstellar conglomerate. In his absence, the business has been run by a relative by marriage, \\"Uncle\\" John Weemsby, who encourages his stepdaughter Leda to help Thorby adjust to his new situation while secretly scheming to block Thorby's growing interest and interference in the company. Thorby, investigating his parents' disappearance and his capture and sale by slavers, comes to suspect that his parents were eliminated to prevent the discovery that some subsidiaries of Rudbek and Associates were secretly supporting (and profiting from) the slave trade. When Weemsby quashes further investigation, Thorby seeks legal help and launches a proxy fight, which he unexpectedly wins when Leda votes her shares in his favor. He fires Weemsby and assumes full control of the firm. When Thorby realizes that extricating Rudbek and Associates from the slave trade is a monumental task, he reluctantly abandons his dream of following in Baslim's footsteps and joining the elite anti-slaver \\"X\\" Corps of the Hegemonic Guard. Knowing that \\"a person can't run out on his responsibilities\\", he resolves to fight the slave trade as the head of Rudbek and Associates. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel, saying \\"Heinlein is invariably logical. And invariably entertaining.\\" In The New York Times, Villiers Gerson received the novel favorably, declaring it \\"better than 99 per cent of the science-fiction adventures produced every year\\" despite structural problems and a weak ending.\\"\\"New Books for the Younger Reader\\", The New York Times Book Review. December 29, 1957 Themes As in many of Heinlein's books, the principal character grows in wisdom and knowledge, beginning in relative ignorance, learning from experience, receiving the benefits of education, and using that education to resolve subsequent problems in his own life and that of those around him. Thorby is placed sequentially in four completely different settings, each of which presents a form of slavery contrasted with personal freedom.

Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture. The title \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" is a direct quotation from the King James Bible (taken from Exodus 2:22). The working title for the book was \\"A Martian Named Smith\\", which was also the name of the screenplay started by a character at the end of the novel. Heinlein's widow Virginia arranged to have the original unedited manuscript published in 1991, three years after Heinlein's death. Critics disagree about which version is superior, but Heinlein preferred the original manuscript and described the heavily edited version as \\"telegraphese\\". In 2012, the Library of Congress named it one of 88 \\"Books that Shaped America\\". Plot The story focuses on a human raised on Mars and his adaptation to and understanding of humans and their culture. It is set in a post-Third World War United States, where organized religions are politically powerful. There is a World Federation of Free Nations, including the demilitarized US, with a world government supported by Special Service troops. Prior to WWIII the manned spacecraft Envoy is launched towards Mars, but all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later, the spacecraft Champion makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the Envoy, he was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany the returning expedition. Because Smith is unaccustomed to the conditions on Earth, he is confined at Bethesda Hospital, where, having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first \\"water brother\\", which is considered to be a profound relationship by the Martians as water on Mars is extremely scarce. Gillian tells her lover, reporter Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith. Ben explains that as heir to the entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish and then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia. Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author who is also a physician and a lawyer. Smith continues to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence, coupled with a childlike na√Øvet√©. When Harshaw tries to explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as \\"one who groks\\", which includes every extant organism. That leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase \\"Thou art God\\" although he knows that to be a bad translation. Many other human concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, and the idea of an afterlife is a fact that he takes for granted because Martian society is directed by \\"Old Ones\\", the spirits of Martians who have \\"discorporated\\". It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead in a rite similar to Holy Communion. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent life. Still inexhaustibly wealthy and now free to travel, Smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the Earth's elite. He investigates many religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a populist megachurch in which sexuality, gambling, alcohol consumption, and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered \\"sinning\\" only when they are not under church auspices. The Church of the New Revelation is organized in a complexity of initiatory levels: an outer circle, open to the public; a middle circle of ordinary members, who support the church financially; and an inner circle of the \\"eternally saved\\", attractive, highly sexed men and women, who serve as clergy and recruit new members. The Church owns many politicians and uses violence against those who oppose it. Smith also has a brief career as a magician in a carnival (performing actual miracles), in which he and Gillian befriend the show's tattooed lady, an \\"eternally saved\\" Fosterite named Patricia Paiwonski. Eventually, Smith starts a Martian-influenced \\"Church of All Worlds\\", combining elements of the Fosterite cult (especially the sexual aspects) with Western esotericism, whose members learn the Martian language and thus acquire the ability to truly \\"grok\\" the nature of reality, granting them psychokinesis. The church is eventually besieged by Fosterites for practicing \\"blasphemy\\", and the church building is destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith's followers teleport to safety. Smith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the Church. With that wealth and their new abilities, Church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures. Eventually, those who cannot or will not learn Smith's methods will die out, leaving Homo Superior. That incidentally may save Earth from eventual destruction by the Martians, who were responsible for the destruction of the fifth planet eons ago (resulting in the asteroid belt). Smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. From the afterlife, he speaks briefly to grief-stricken Jubal to dissuade him from suicide. Having consumed a small portion of Smith's remains in keeping with Martian custom, Jubal and some of the Church members return to Jubal's home to regroup and prepare for their new evangelical role founding congregations. Meanwhile, Smith reappears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites' eponymous founder, amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael. Characters Heinlein named his main character \\"Smith\\" because of a speech he made at a science fiction convention regarding the unpronounceable names assigned to extraterrestrials. After describing the importance of establishing a dramatic difference between humans and aliens, Heinlein concluded, \\"Besides, whoever heard of a Martian named Smith?\\" The title Stranger In a Strange Land is taken from the King James Version of Exodus 2:22, \\"And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land\\". In the preface to the uncut, original version of the book re-issued in 1991, Heinlein's widow, Virginia, wrote: \\"The given names of the chief characters have great importance to the plot. They were carefully selected: Jubal means 'the father of all,' Michael stands for 'Who is like God?. ;Valentine Michael Smith: Known as Michael Smith or \\"Mike\\", the \\"Man from Mars\\" is born on Mars in the interval between the landing of the Envoy and the arrival of the Champion. He is 20 years old when the Champion arrives and brings him to Earth. ;Gillian (Jill) Boardman: A nurse at Bethesda Hospital who sneaks Mike out of government custody. She plays a key role in introducing him to human culture and becomes one of his closest confidantes and a central figure in the Church of All Worlds, which Mike develops. ;Ben Caxton: An early love interest of Jill and an investigative journalist (Jill sees him as of the \\"lippmann\\", political, rather than the \\"winchell\\", or celebrity gossip inclination), who masterminds Mike's initial freedom from custody. He joins Mike's inner circle but remains somewhat skeptical at first of the social order that it develops. ;Jubal Harshaw: A popular writer, lawyer, and doctor, now semi-retired to a house in the Pocono Mountains, an influential but reclusive public figure who provides pivotal support for Mike's independence and a safe haven for him. Elderly but in good health, he serves as a father figure for the inner circle while keeping a suspicious distance from it. The character's name was chosen by Heinlein to have unusual overtones, like Jonathan Hoag. Mike enshrines him (much to Harshaw's initial chagrin) as the patron saint of the church he founds. ;Anne, Miriam, Dorcas: Harshaw's three personal/professional secretaries, who live with him and take turns as his \\"front\\", responding to his instructions. Anne is certified as a Fair Witness, empowered to provide objective legal testimony about events that she witnesses.

Reception Heinlein's deliberately provocative book generated considerable controversy. The free love and commune living aspects of the Church of All Worlds led to the book's exclusion from school reading lists. After it was rumored to be associated with Charles Manson, it was removed from school libraries as well. Writing in The New York Times, Orville Prescott received the novel caustically, describing it as a \\"disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire and cheap eroticism\\"; he characterized Stranger in a Strange Land as \\"puerile and ludicrous\\", saying \\"when a non-stop orgy is combined with a lot of preposterous chatter, it becomes unendurable, an affront to the patience and intelligence of readers\\". Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the novel 3.5 stars out of five, saying \\"the book's shortcomings lie not so much in its emancipation as in the fact that Heinlein has bitten off too large a chewing portion\\". Despite such reviews, Stranger in a Strange Land won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter The New York Times Book Reviews best-seller list. In 2012, it was included in a Library of Congress exhibition of \\"Books That Shaped America\\". Critics have also suggested that Jubal Harshaw is actually a stand-in for Robert Heinlein himself, based on similarities in career choice and general disposition, though Harshaw is much older than Heinlein was at the time of writing. Literary critic Dan Schneider wrote that Harshaw's belief in his own free will, was one \\"which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, 'Thou art God!Dan Schneider, Review of Stranger In A Strange Land (The Uncut Version), by Robert A. Heinlein (29 July 2005). Development Heinlein got the idea for the novel when he and his wife Virginia were brainstorming one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade. His editors at Putnam then required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,000 words before publication. Originally titled The Heretic, the book was written in part as a deliberate attempt to challenge social mores. In the course of the story, Heinlein uses Smith's open-mindedness to reevaluate such institutions as religion, money, monogamy, and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, \\"I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right.\\"Expanded Universe, p. 403. The book was dedicated in part to science fiction author Philip Jos√© Farmer, who had explored sexual themes in works such as The Lovers (1952). It was also influenced by the satiric fantasies of James Branch Cabell. Heinlein was surprised that some readers thought the book described how he believed society should be organized, explaining: \\"I was not giving answers. I was trying to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers ... It is an invitation to think ‚Äì not to believe.\\" Influence The book significantly influenced modern culture in a variety of ways. =Church of All Worlds= A central element of the second half of the novel is the religious movement founded by Smith, the \\"Church of All Worlds\\", an initiatory mystery religion blending elements of paganism and revivalism, with psychic training and instruction in the Martian language. In 1968, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways after the fictional organization in the novel. The spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including polyamory, non- mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as \\"grok\\", \\"Thou art God\\", and \\"Never Thirst\\". Heinlein objected to Zell's lumping him with other writers such as Ayn Rand and Robert Rimmer; Heinlein felt that those writers used their art for propaganda purposes, while he simply asked questions of the reader, expecting each reader to answer for him- or herself. He wrote to Zell in a letter: \\"... each reader gets something different out of the book because he himself supplies the answers. If I managed to shake him loose from some prejudice, preconception or unexamined assumption, that was all I intended to do.\\"William H. Patterson Jr., 2014, Robert A. Heinlein In Dialogue with His Century, Vol. 2, pg. 597 Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, it was formed including frequent correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and Heinlein was a paid subscriber to the Church's magazine Green Egg. This Church still exists as a 501(c)(3) recognized religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today. =Grok= The word \\"grok\\", coined in the novel, made its way into the English language. In Heinlein's invented Martian language, \\"grok\\" literally means \\"to drink\\" and figuratively means \\"to comprehend\\", \\"to love\\", and \\"to be one with\\". The word rapidly became common parlance among science fiction fans, hippies, and later computer programmers and hackers, and has since entered the Oxford English Dictionary. =Fair Witness= The profession of Fair Witness, invented for the novel, has been cited in such varied contexts as environmentalism, psychology, technology, digital signatures, and science, as well as books on leadership, and Sufism. A Fair Witness is an individual trained to observe events and report exactly what is seen and heard, making no extrapolations or assumptions. When in the Fair Witness uniform of a white robe, they are presumed to be observing and opining in their professional capacity. Works that refer to the Fair Witness emphasize the profession's impartiality, integrity, objectivity, and reliability. An example from the book illustrates the role of Fair Witness when Anne is asked what color a house is. She answers, \\"It's white on this side.\\" The character Jubal then explains, \\"You see? It doesn‚Äôt occur to Anne to infer that the other side is white, too. All the King‚Äôs horses couldn‚Äôt force her to commit herself...unless she went there and looked ‚Äì and even then she wouldn‚Äôt assume that it stayed white after she left.‚Äù =Waterbed= Stranger in a Strange Land contains an early description of the waterbed, an invention that made its real-world debut in 1968. Charles Hall, who brought a waterbed design to the United States Patent Office, was refused a patent on the grounds that Heinlein's descriptions in Stranger in a Strange Land and another novel, Double Star (1956), constituted prior art. In popular culture * Leon Russell and the Shelter People features a song titled Stranger in a Strange Land with lyrics that describe ideas from the novel, sometimes narrated by Valentine's perspective, other times in a 3rd person. * Heinlein's novella Lost Legacy (1941) lends its theme, and possibly some characters, to Stranger in a Strange Land. In a relevant part of the story, Joan Freeman is described as feeling like \\"a stranger in a strange land\\". Chapter 10 * The Police released an Andy Summers-penned song titled \\"Friends\\", as the B-side to their hit \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" (1980), that referenced the novel. Summers claimed that it \\"was about eating your friends, or 'grocking' them as [Stranger in a Strange Land] put it\\". * Billy Joel's song \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" (1989) mentions the novel. * The Byrds' song \\"Triad\\" (1967), a song about a menage a trois, uses the term \\"water brother\\" from the novel. * In November 2016, Syfy announced plans to develop a TV series based on the novel with Paramount Television and Universal Cable Productions co-producing the series. Publication history Two major versions of this book exist: *The 1961 version which, at the publisher's request, Heinlein cut by 25% in length. Approximately 60,000 words were removed from the original manuscript, including some sharp criticism of American attitudes toward sex and religion. The book was marketed to a mainstream readership, and was the first science fiction novel to be listed on The New York Times Best Seller list for fiction. By 1997, over 100,000 copies of the hardback edition had been sold along with nearly five million copies of the paperback. None of his later novels would match this level of success. *The 1991 version, retrieved from Heinlein's archives in the University of California, Santa Cruz, Special Collections Department by Heinlein's widow, Virginia, and published posthumously, which reproduces the original manuscript and restores all cuts. It came about because in 1989, Virginia renewed the copyright to Stranger and cancelled the existing publication contracts in accordance with the Copyright Act of 1976. Both Heinlein's agent and his publisher (which had new senior editors) agreed that the uncut version was better: readers are used to longer books, and what was seen as objectionable in 1961 was no longer so 30 years later. Heinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. He wrote, \\"SISL was never censored by anyone in any fashion. The first draft was nearly twice as long as the published version. I cut it myself to bring it down to a commercial length. But I did not leave out anything of any importance; I simply trimmed all possible excess verbiage. Perhaps you have noticed that it reads \\"fast\\" despite its length; that is why. ... The original, longest version of SISL ... is really not worth your trouble, as it is the same story throughout‚Äîsimply not as well told. With it is the brushpenned version which shows exactly what was cut out‚Äînothing worth reading, that is. I learned to write for pulp magazines, in which one was paid by the yard rather than by the package; it was not until I started writing for the Saturday Evening Post that I learned the virtue of brevity.\\"Letter from Robert A. Heinlein to Oberon Zell, Green Egg magazine, Vol. XXII. No. 85 (Beltane, 1989). Additionally, since Heinlein added material while he was editing the manuscript for the commercial release, the 1991 publication of the original manuscript is missing some material that was in the novel when it was first published. =Editions= Many editions exist: Retrieved June 16, 2017.

Heinlein, originally serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (July - September 1963) and published in hardcover the same year. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964. Plot summary Evelyn Cyril \\"E.C.\\" Gordon (also known as \\"Easy\\" and \\"Flash\\") has been recently discharged from an unnamed war in Southeast Asia. He is pondering what to do with his future and considers spending a year traveling in France. He is presented with a dilemma: follow up on a possible winning entry in the Irish Sweepstakes or respond to a newspaper ad that asks \\"Are you a coward?\\". He settles on the latter, discovering it has been placed by Star, a stunningly gorgeous woman he has previously met on √éle du Levant. Star informs him that he is the one to embark on a perilous quest to retrieve the Egg of the Phoenix. When she asks what to call him, he wants to suggest Scarface, referring to the scar on his face, but she stops him as he is saying \\"Oh, Scar...\\" and repeats this as \\"Oscar\\", and thus gives him his new name. Along with Rufo, her assistant, who appears to be a man in his fifties, they tread the \\"Glory Road\\" in swashbuckling style, slaying dragons and other exotic creatures. Shortly before the final Quest for the Egg itself, Oscar and Star marry. The team then proceeds to enter the tower in which the Egg has been hidden, navigating a maze of illusions and optical tricks. Oscar scouts ahead and encounters a fearsome foe who, though unnamed, is clearly the legendary 17th-century swordsman Cyrano de Bergerac, the final guardian of the Egg. After a long fight, the party escapes with the Egg. When they arrive in the home universe of Star and Rufo, Rufo informs Oscar that Star is actually the Empress of many worlds‚Äîand Rufo's grandmother. The Egg is a cybernetic device that contains the knowledge and experiences of most of her predecessors. Despite her youthful appearance, she is the mother of dozens of children (by egg donation) and has undergone special medical treatments that extend her life much longer than usual. She has Oscar unknowingly receive the same treatments. Initially, Oscar enjoys his new-found prestige and luxurious life as the husband of the Empress of the Twenty Universes. However, as time goes on, he grows bored and feels out of place and useless. When he demands Star's professional judgment, she tells him that he must leave; her world has no place or need for a hero of his stature. It will be decades before she can complete the transfer of the knowledge held in the Egg, so he must go alone. He returns to Earth but has difficulty readjusting to his own world, despite having brought great wealth along with him. He begins to doubt his own sanity and whether the adventure even happened. The story ends as he is contacted by Rufo to set up another trip along the Glory Road. Reception Samuel R. Delany called the novel \\"endlessly fascinating\\" and said that it \\"maintains a delicacy, a bravura, and a joy\\". It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1964, losing to Way Station by Clifford D. Simak.

Heinlein about a lunar colony's revolt against absentee rule from Earth. The novel expresses and discusses libertarian ideals. It is respected for its credible presentation of a comprehensively imagined future human society on both the Earth and the Moon. Originally serialized monthly in Worlds of If (December 1965‚ÄìApril 1966), the book was then nominated for the Nebula Award in 1966, yet it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1967. Plot In 2075, the Moon (Luna) is used as a penal colony by Earth's government, with three million inhabitants (called \\"Loonies\\") living in underground cities. Most Loonies are criminals, political exiles, or their descendants, and men outnumber women two to one, so that polyandry and many forms of polygamy are the norm. Due to the low surface gravity of the Moon, people who stay longer than six months undergo \\"irreversible physiological changes\\" and can never again live comfortably under normal gravity, making escape back to Earth impractical. Although the Earth-appointed \\"Warden\\" holds power through the Lunar Authority, his only real responsibility is to ensure the delivery of vital wheat shipments to Earth. In practice he seldom intervenes among the prisoners, allowing a virtually anarchist or self- regulated society. Lunar infrastructure and machinery is largely managed by HOLMES IV (\\"High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV\\"), the Lunar Authority's master computer, which is connected for central control on the grounds that a single computer is cheaper than (though not as safe as) multiple independent systems. The story is narrated by Manuel Garcia \\"Mannie\\" O'Kelly-Davis, a computer technician who discovers that HOLMES IV has achieved self-awareness and developed a sense of humor. Mannie names it \\"Mike\\" after Mycroft Holmes, brother of Sherlock Holmes, and they become friends. =Book 1: That Dinkum Thinkum= At the beginning of the story, Mannie, at Mike's request, attends an anti-Authority meeting with a hidden recorder. When police raid the gathering, Mannie flees with Wyoming (\\"Wyoh\\") Knott, a political agitator, whom he introduces to Mike. They meet Mannie's former mentor, the elderly Professor Bernardo de la Paz, who claims that Luna must stop exporting hydroponic grain to Earth or its ice-mines will soon be exhausted, leaving the Moon waterless. Joining the cabal, Mike calculates that without prevention, food riots will occur in seven years and cannibalism in nine. Wyoh and the Professor decide to start a revolution, and persuade Mannie to join after Mike calculates a one in seven chance of success. Mannie, Wyoh, and the Professor organize covert cells protected by Mike, who controls the telephone system and presents himself as \\"Adam Selene\\", leader of the movement. Mannie saves the life of Stuart Rene LaJoie, a slumming high-society tourist, who is assigned to turn public opinion on Earth in favor of Lunar independence. Amid mounting unrest fomented by the revolutionaries, Earth soldiers are brought in. The undisciplined troops kill some local young women, who occupy a quasi-Victorian position in the female-starved Lunar society, and rioting erupts. Although it pre-empts their plans, the Loonies and Mike overcome the soldiers and seize power from the Warden. As Earth moves to reclaim the colony, the revolutionaries plan to defend themselves with the electromagnetic catapult used to export wheat. =Book 2: A Rabble in Arms= Mike impersonates the Warden in messages to Earth, to give the revolutionaries time to organize their work. Meanwhile, the Professor sets up an \\"Ad-Hoc Congress\\" to distract dissenters. When Earth finally learns the truth, Luna declares its independence on July 4, 2076, the 300th anniversary of the US Declaration of Independence, and heavily bases its own declaration of independence on it. Mannie and the Professor go to Earth (despite the crushing gravity) to plead Luna's case, where they are received in the Federated Nations' headquarters in Agra, and embark on a world tour advocating the right to Lunar self- government, while urging Earth's national governments to build a catapult to transfer water to Luna in exchange for wheat. In a public relations ploy, Mannie provokes a brief imprisonment by local religious bigots on charges of public immorality and polygamy, reaping widespread sympathy. Nevertheless, the Federated Nations reject the proposals, and the diplomatic mission returns to Luna. Public opinion on Earth has become fragmented, while on Luna, the news of Mannie's arrest and an attempt to bribe him by making him the new Warden have unified the normally apolitical Loonies. An election is held in which Mannie, Wyoh, and the Professor are elected (possibly by the intervention of Mike). =Book 3: TANSTAAFL!= (The title is an acronym for \\"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!\\", a common expression on Luna that states one of the main ideas of the book's political system). The Federated Nations of Earth send an infantry force to destroy the Lunar revolution, but the troops, with superior arms but inexperienced in low-gravity underground combat, are defeated by the Loonies at great cost. The rumor is circulated that Mike's alter ego Adam Selene was among the dead, removing the need for him to appear in person. Earth still refuses to recognize Lunar independence, and the revolutionaries deploy their catapult weapon. When Mike launches rocks at sparsely populated locations on Earth, warnings are released to the press detailing the times and locations of the bombings, which deliver kinetic energy equivalent to atomic blasts. Some scoffers, as well as apocalyptic religious groups, travel to the sites and die, turning public opinion against the fledgling nation. For Mike, guiding dozens of simultaneous projectile strikes requires an unprecedented computational feat, and when the pinpoints light up on the Earth below, he tells Mannie it is an orgasmic experience. Earth sends a massive sneak attack to put an end to the rebellion, sending ships in a wide orbit approaching from the Moon's dark side. The attack occupies the cities, destroys Mike's original catapult, and takes him offline, but the Loonies have built a secondary, hidden catapult. With Mannie acting as its on-site commander and doing computations by hand, the Loonies continue to bombard the dismayed Earth government until it concedes Luna's independence. Professor Bernardo de la Paz, as leader of the nation, proclaims victory to the gathered crowds, but his heart gives out and he dies. Mannie takes control, but Wyoh and he eventually withdraw from politics altogether, and find that the new government falls short of their utopian expectations, falling into a mundane political party system. When Mannie tries to speak to Mike, he finds that the computer, disconnected by the bombardment, has lost its self-awareness and human-like memories after repair, although otherwise functional. Mike gave his life for his country. Mourning his friend, Mannie asks: \\"Bog, is a computer one of Your creatures?\\" Characters *Manuel \\"Mannie\\" Garcia O'Kelly-Davis is a native-born, slightly cynical inhabitant of Luna, who after losing his lower left arm in a laser-drilling accident, became a computer technician. *Wyoming \\"Wyoh\\" Knott-Davis is a political agitator from the colony of Hong Kong Luna. She hates the callous and indifferent Lunar Authority for personal reasons; when she was transported to Luna as a young girl along with her convict mother, a radiation storm contaminated her ova, causing her to later give birth to a deformed child ‚Äì a misfortune that could have been averted had the Lunar Authority acted in a timely manner to move their ship's passengers from the surface of Luna. *Professor Bernardo de la Paz is an intellectual and lifelong subversive shipped to Luna from Lima, Peru. He describes himself as a \\"Rational Anarchist\\", believing that governments and institutions exist only as the actions of aware individuals. Brian Doherty claims that the professor was modeled after autarchist Robert LeFevre.Doherty, Brian.

He later joins Mannie and Professor de la Paz when they return to Luna, as he is deeply in debt and would be arrested for bribery and other crimes. In his own words \\"I'm saving them the trouble of transporting me [as a convict]\\". *Hazel Meade, later Hazel Stone, is a 12-year-old girl who intervenes on behalf of Mannie and Wyoh during the raid on the agitators' meeting. Mannie later has Hazel join his cabal to lead the children as lookouts and couriers.

Greg is a preacher for an unspecified denomination. Major themes = Timeline = The first sixth of the book relates the discussions between the protagonists justifying and plotting the revolution; the next quarter describes the year-long revolution itself. The remainder of the book recounts events occurring in the months after the revolution in May 2076, and a week or so of events in October 2076 leading up to capitulation by Earth. =Politics and society= Professor Bernardo de La Paz describes himself as a \\"Rational Anarchist\\", a term probably invented in the text itself. \\"Rational Anarchists\\" believe that the concepts of State, Society, and Government have no existence but for the \\"acts of self-responsible individuals\\", but concede that this is not a universal belief. The desire for anarchy is balanced by the logic that some form of government is needed, despite its flaws. Knowing this fact, a Rational Anarchist \\"tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world\\". When challenged by Wyoh, Professor de la Paz replies, \\"In terms of morals there is no such thing as a 'state'. Just men. Individuals. Each responsible for his own acts. I am free, no matter what rules surround me. If I find them tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find them too obnoxious, I break them. I am free, because I know that I alone am morally responsible for everything that I do.\\" Lunar society is portrayed as akin to that of the Old West, tempered by the closeness of death by exposure to vacuum and by the shortage of women. Because the sex ratio is about two men to each woman, the result is a society where women have a great deal of power, and any man who offends or touches a woman uninvited is likely to be attacked and eliminated through the nearest airlock. Marriages tend to be polyandrous, including group marriages and Mannie's own line marriage. In discussion with a woman from Kentucky, Mannie implies that underground, three-dimensional Lunar estate is recorded in the name of the woman (or women) in a marriage. In a divorce, he implies, the separated man (or men) who contributed towards its cost would have money returned to him. After decades during which antisocial individuals were selectively eliminated and the Authority exercised little real control, the Loonies live by the following code: Pay your debts, collect what is owed to you, and maintain your reputation and that of your family. As a result, little theft occurs, and disputes are settled privately or by informal Judges of good reputation. Failure to pay debts results in public shaming. Reputation is highly important in this society; with a bad reputation, a person may find others unwilling to buy from or sell to him. People are expected to pay back debts using all available funds. Duels are permitted, but custom requires that anyone who kills another must pay debts and look after the deceased's family. Exceptions are allowed in the case of self-defense. Retaliatory killings do occur, but typically a consensus establishes which party was in the right, and no long-standing feuds exist. The Vikings influence mores on the Loonies, save that it is the society as a whole rather than the Althing which judges the actions of individuals. Except where exchange involves the Authority, a generally unregulated free market exists. The preferred currency is the dollar of the Bank of Hong Kong Luna, 100 of which are exchangeable for a troy ounce of gold, a supply of which was shipped to Luna for this purpose, or more usefully for potable water or other commodities in published quantities. The Authority dollar circulates in dealings with the Authority, but this tends to lose ground over time against the Hong Kong Luna dollar. =Outcomes= Although the revolution succeeds in averting ecological disaster, the narrator decries the instincts of many of his fellow Loonies (\\"Rules, laws ‚Äì always for [the] other fellow\\"). This theme is echoed elsewhere in Heinlein's works ‚Äì that real liberty is to be found among the pioneer societies out along the advancing frontier, but the regimentation and legalism that follow bring restraints that chafe true individualists (an idea emphasized in the first and final page of the novel, and in the later book The Cat Who Walks Through Walls). =Plot elements= As in Stranger in a Strange Land, a band of social revolutionaries forms a secretive and hierarchical organization. In this respect, the revolution is more reminiscent of the Bolshevik October revolution than of the American, and this similarity is reinforced by the Russian flavor of the dialect, and the Russian place names such as \\"Novy Leningrad\\". Continuing Heinlein's speculation about unorthodox social and family structures, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress introduces the idea of a \\"line marriage\\". Mannie is part of a century-old line marriage, wherein new spouses are introduced by mutual consent at regular intervals so that the marriage never comes to an end. Divorce is rare, since divorcing a husband requires a unanimous decision on the part of all of his wives. Senior wives teach junior wives how to operate the family, granting financial security and ensuring that the children will never be orphaned. Children usually marry outside the line marriage, though this is not an ironclad rule. Mannie's youngest wife sports the last name \\"Davis-Davis\\", showing she was both born and married into the line. The social structure of the Lunar society features complete racial integration, which becomes a vehicle for social commentary when Mannie, visiting the Southeastern United States, is arrested for polygamy after he innocently shows a picture of his multiracial family to reporters, and learns that the \\"range of color in Davis family was what got [the] judge angry enough\\" to have him arrested. It is later revealed that this arrest was anticipated and provoked by his fellow conspirators to gain emotional support from Loonies when the arrest is announced. The novel is notable stylistically for its use of an invented Lunar dialect consisting predominantly of standard English and Australian colloquial words, but strongly influenced by Russian grammar, especially omission of the article \\"the\\", which does not exist in most Slavic languages (cf. Nadsat slang from A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess). This aspect of the Lunar dialect is explained by the fact that many of the deportees on Luna are Russian. =Earth politics and background history= The novel indicates that Earth had experienced a nuclear world war (the \\"Wet Firecracker War\\") in the past century, although no significant traces of devastation are apparent at the time of the novel's setting. Other changes include unification of the entire North American continent under a successor government to the United States, and political unification of South America, Europe, and Africa into megastates. The Soviet Union seems to have lost the land east of the Urals to China into a rump state, and China has conquered all of East Asia, Southeast Asia, eastern Australia, and New Zealand (deporting unwanted people to Luna in the process). This Chinese aggrandizement is similar to that described in Tunnel in the Sky, and to a lesser extent, Sixth Column. The militarily dominant nations seem to be North America and China. India is overcrowded, but seems able to obtain many of the wheat shipments from Luna. It is suggested that the Western nations, including North America, have become corrupt and authoritarian, while holding on to the vestiges of the prewar democratic idealism in propaganda and popular culture. China is portrayed as plainly and unabashedly despotic, but no less technically advanced than the West. The Soviet Union seems to have relatively little influence, whereas the Lunar Authority itself is portrayed as corrupt. Sources, allusions, and references =Possible sources= The situation depicted in the second and third part of the novel resembles the rebellion of the Lunar colony described in another science-fiction novel published in 1959, Time Out of Joint, by Philip K. Dick. While the opposition between Earth and Moon echoes the historical conflict between the United States and the British Empire, the way the Lunar rebels force Earth to acknowledge their independence is similar to the one they adopt in Dick's novel (launching missiles, some with nuclear warheads, in an unpredictable fashion). =Allusions to other works= Professor de la Paz names Carl von Clausewitz, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Oskar Morgenstern, and Che Guevara as part of a long list of authors for revolutionaries to read. He also quotes a \\"Chinese General\\" on the subject of weakening the enemy's resolve, a reference to Sun Tzu's The Art of War. When planning the revolution, Mike is described by Mannie as \\"our Scarlet Pimpernel, our John Galt, our Swamp Fox, our man of mystery\\", referring to the works of the Baroness Orczy and Ayn Rand, as well as to the history of the American Revolution. Parallels to the American Revolution are intentional; Luna's Declaration of Independence is issued on July 4, 2076, and one event is referred to as paralleling the Boston Tea Party. When discussing the resource loss on Luna and likelihood of ensuing food riots, Professor de la Paz suggests that Mannie read the work of Thomas Malthus. = Connections to other Heinlein works = Hazel Meade Stone first appears as a character in Heinlein's earlier book, The Rolling Stones, a.k.a. Space Family Stone (1952). The setting of the Luna revolt is revisited by Heinlein in his late-period novel, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, which again includes Stone as a character. The book shows that by 2188 the names of the signatories of the Lunar Declaration of Independence are studied, but Room L of the Raffles Hotel, wherein the revolution was plotted, is used as an ordinary hotel room, albeit with a plaque on the wall. =References to history, geography, and science= The Lunar action takes place in Mare Crisium and the novel makes accurate references to such nearby locales as Crater Peirce. According to the narrator, most people live in one of six major underground \\"warrens\\" linked by \\"tube\\", a system of underground trains. Luna City is the most important to the plot, and is \\"on the eastern edge of Mare Crisium\\". The Authority warren Complex Under is connected to Luna City by the Trans-Crisium tube. Johnson City is close to the complex, linked by a single tunnel. Novy Leningrad, a large warren, is linked to Luna City by tube, and a journey between the two requires the traveler to \\"change at Torricelli\\". Another warren is Tycho Under, whose location is clearly in the area of the crater Tycho. Hong Kong Luna is located in Crater Plato. The warren known as Churchill is not described in detail, although it is linked to Hong Kong Luna by a tube across the Sinus Medii on the Lunar Prime Meridian. The secret catapult is built in the region of Mare Undarum. Colorado Springs is mentioned as near the military target Cheyenne Mountain Complex which took a direct hit during the \\"Wet Firecracker War\\", but suffered little damage until hit many times by rock missiles from Luna. The headquarters of the Lunar Authority on Earth are in the city of Agra, near the Taj Mahal. The bombardment from Luna omits the city of Agra from its target list out of respect. Mannie, a New York Yankees fan, visits what is presumed to be Yankee Stadium, now expanded to hold at least 200,000 people, and also visits Salem and Concord in Massachusetts. Lasers are used primarily as mining and cutting tools, but are adapted as hand weapons and ground-to-orbit weapons by the Loonies. Luna's industries use both solar power and hydrogen fusion. Heinlein correctly quotes the maximum yield of solar cells at about 1 kilowatt per square meter, but is over-optimistic with regard to fusion, describing it as taking place in small magnetic pinch bottles. Mannie refers to a comrade, Foo Moses Morris, who, following the revolution, goes broke and starts a tailor shop in Hong Kong Luna, a reference to both Robert Morris and, by allusion, Haym Salomon, who helped support the American revolutionary government and also suffered financial reverses. = The Brass Cannon = Heinlein's original title for the novel was The Brass Cannon, before being replaced with the final title at the publisher's request. It was derived from an event in the novel: While on Earth, Professor Bernardo de la Paz purchases a small brass cannon, originally a \\"signal gun\\" of the kind used in yacht racing. When Mannie asks him why he bought it, the Professor relates a parable, implying that self-government is an illusion caused by failure to understand reality: Professor de la Paz asks Mannie to assure that Luna adopts a flag featuring a brass cannon ‚Äî \\"a symbol for all fools who are so impractical as to think they can fight City Hall\\". Before leaving politics, Mannie and Wyoh carry out his wish. Heinlein owned a small brass cannon, which he acquired prior to the 1960s. For nearly 30 years, the firing of the brass cannon, or \\"signal gun\\", was a 4th of July tradition at the Heinlein residence. It is believed that this cannon was the inspiration for Heinlein's original title for the novel. Virginia Heinlein retained the cannon after her husband's death in 1988; it was eventually bequeathed to friend and science-fiction writer Brad Linaweaver, after Virginia Heinlein died in 2003. Linaweaver restored the cannon to working order and subsequently posted a video of it on YouTube in 2007, wherein it is fired several times with blank charges at a shooting range.. The cannon is fired after 6 minutes into the 9-minute video. Critical reception Algis Budrys of Galaxy Science Fiction in 1966 praised The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, citing \\"Heinlein's expertise for dirt-level politics, snappy dialogue and a sense of an actual living society\\". He said that he had never read a more believable computer character than Mike (\\"may in fact be the most fully realized individual in the story\\"). Budrys suggested that the story may actually be Mike manipulating humans without their knowledge to improve its situation, which would explain why the computer no longer communicates with them after the revolution succeeds. Reiterating that Mike manipulated the humans, in 1968 Budrys said that every review of the book, including his own, erred by not stating that the computer is the protagonist. Carl Sagan wrote that the novel had \\"useful suggestions for making a revolution in an oppressive computerized society\\". Leigh Kimmel of The Billion Light-Year Bookshelf said that the novel is \\"the work of the man at the height of his powers, confident in his abilities and in the editorial respect he enjoys, and thus free to take significant risks in writing a novel that would stretch the boundaries of the genre as they stood at the time\\". She characterized the novel as a departure from what had previously been associated with science fiction. Kimmel cited Heinlein's \\"colloquial language ... an extrapolated lunar creole that has arisen from the forced intersection of multiple cultures and languages in the lunar penal colonies\\"; the protagonist's disability; \\"the frank treatment of alternative family structures\\"; and \\"the computer which suddenly wakes up to full artificial intelligence, but rather than becoming a Monster that threatens human society and must be destroyed as the primary Quest of the story, instead befriends the protagonist and seeks to become ever more human, a sort of digital Pinocchio\\". Adam Roberts said of the novel: \\"It is really quite hard to respond to this masterful book, except by engaging with its political content; and yet we need to make the effort to see past the ideological to the formal and thematic if we are fully to appreciate the splendour of Heinlein's achievement here.\\" Andrew Kaufman praised it, saying that it was Heinlein's crowning achievement. He described it as \\"Carefully plotted, stylistically unique, politically sophisticated and thrilling from page one\\". He goes on to say that \\"it's hard to imagine anyone else writing a novel that packs so many ideas (both big and small) into such a perfectly contained narrative\\". Kaufman says that, regardless of political philosophies, one can still admire Heinlein's writing ability, and the ability to influence the reader to root for \\"a rag-tag bunch of criminals, exiles, and agitators\\". Ted Gioia said that this might be Heinlein's most enjoyable piece of work. He said that it \\"represents Robert Heinlein at his finest, giving him scope for the armchair philosophizing that increasingly dominated his mature work, but marrying his polemics to a smartly conceived plot packed with considerable drama\\". He went on to praise Heinlein's characters, especially Mannie. Awards and nominations * Hugo Award Best novel (1967).

Heinlein, originally serialised in Galaxy (July, August/September, October/November, December 1970) and published in hardcover in 1970. The title is taken from Psalm 23:4. Plot summary The story takes place in the early 21st century against a background of an overpopulated Earth with a violent, dysfunctional society. Elderly billionaire Johann Sebastian Bach Smith is being kept alive through medical support and decides to have his brain transplanted into a new body. He advertises an offer of a million dollars for the donation of a body from a brain-dead patient. Smith omits to place any restriction on the sex of the donor, so when his beautiful young female secretary, Eunice Branca, is murdered, her body is used. He changes his name to Joan Eunice Smith, with the first name given \\"the two-syllable pronunciation\\" Jo-Ann to mimic the sound of his original name. After Smith awakens after the transplant, he discovers he can communicate with Eunice's personality. They agree not to reveal her existence, fearing that they would be judged insane and locked up. Smith's identity is unsuccessfully challenged by his descendants, who hope to inherit his fortune. Smith and Eunice decide to have a baby together and so they (Joan and Eunice) are artificially inseminated using Smith's sperm from the sperm bank. Joan explores her new sexuality at length. She goes to visit Eunice's widower, Joe Branca, to help reconcile him to what has happened. Joan marries her lawyer, Jake Salomon, and moves her household and friends onto a boat. Jake has a massive rupture of a large blood vessel in his brain and dies, but his personality is saved and joins Smith and Eunice in Joan's head. She (Joan, Eunice and Jake) emigrate to the Moon to find a better future for her child. Once there, her body starts to reject her (Smith's) transplanted brain. She dies during childbirth. Writing Heinlein suffered from life-threatening peritonitis after completing the first draft of this novel. He remained ill for the next two years and it is thought to have been published without his usual editing and polish. Accolades The novel was voted the ninth best science fiction novel of 1970 by readers of Locus magazine.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/ay.cgi?28+1971 Retrieved 30 October 2017.

Heinlein, published in 1985. Like many of his later novels, it features Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw as supporting characters. Plot summary A writer seated at the best restaurant of the space habitat \\"Golden Rule\\" is approached by a man who urges him that \\"Tolliver must die\\" and is himself shot before the writer's eyes. The writer‚ÄîColonel Colin Campbell, living under a number of aliases including his pen name \\"Richard Ames\\"‚Äîis joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady, Gwendolyn Novak, who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer (\\"Bill\\"). After escaping to the Moon, Gwen claims to have been present during the revolt described in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Still pursued by assassins, Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long. After giving Campbell a new foot to replace one lost in combat years before, the Time Corps attempts to recruit Campbell for a special mission. Accepting only on Gwen's account, Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike, a sentient computer introduced in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Engaged in frequent time- travel, the Time Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past, creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt. Mike's assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created. Campbell's frequent would-be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who, for unknown reasons, do not want to see Mike rescued by the Time Corps. During the mission, Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again, though the Time Corps succeed in retrieving Mike. The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder (presumably the source of the first-person narrative) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen. Background The Cat Who Walks Through Walls may be regarded as part of Heinlein's multiverse series, or as a sequel to both The Number of the Beast and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. During a meeting of the Council of the Time Scouts, representatives from every major time line and setting written by Heinlein appear, including Glory Road and Starship Troopers, and references are made to other authors' works as well. The title of the book refers to a cat by the name of Pixel, who has an inexplicable tendency to be wherever the narrator happens to be (see Schr√∂dinger's cat). In one scene Pixel does, in fact, walk through a wall, and it is explained that Pixel is too young to know that such behavior is impossible. Connections to other Heinlein works Gwen Novak is eventually revealed to be Hazel Stone, a character previously featured in Heinlein's The Rolling Stones and who had played a small but important role in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Campbell is also eventually revealed to be a son of Lazarus Long, a Heinlein character originally introduced in Methuselah's Children and who reappeared in Time Enough for Love, The Number of the Beast, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset. Also appearing are Jubal Harshaw, a major character in Stranger in a Strange Land; Galahad, of Time Enough for Love; and Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis, the first- person voice of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. Reception Dave Langford reviewed The Cat Who Walks Through Wall for White Dwarf #76, and stated that \\"I'm afraid it's Heinlein self-indulgence time again. What's on the menu is those blasted inter-universal travellers from Number of the Beast, plus walk- ons from Time Enough for Love, Glory Road, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Stranger in a Strange Land and more.\\" References External links  1985 American novels Books with cover art by Michael Whelan Novels by Robert A.

Portrayed by Mark Hamill, Luke first appeared in Star Wars (1977), and he returned in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Three decades later, he portrayed the character in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, appearing in all three films: The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Originally a farmer on Tatooine living with his uncle and aunt, who are later killed by stormtroopers, Luke becomes a pivotal figure in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire, a friend and eventual brother-in-law of smuggler Han Solo, and unknown to him until Return of the Jedi, the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia. He trains to be a Jedi under Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, and is the son of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (turned Sith Lord Darth Vader) and Padm√© Amidala. He mentors the sequel trilogy's protagonist, Rey, and is the maternal uncle and the former Jedi trainer of its antagonist, Kylo Ren. Though Luke dies at the end of The Last Jedi, he returns as a Force spirit in The Rise of Skywalker, encouraging Rey to face the revived Emperor Palpatine and empowering her alongside the spirits of other former Jedi during her final confrontation with him. His ghost also appears in the film's epilogue scene alongside his sister's, who died redeeming Kylo Ren earlier in the film. The character also briefly appears in the prequel film Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith as an infant. The Expanded Universe, which has been declared , depicts him as a powerful Jedi Master, the husband of Mara Jade, father of Ben Skywalker and maternal uncle of Jaina, Jacen and Anakin Solo. Appearances =Skywalker saga= Original trilogy In the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke Skywalker represents the hero archetype of \\"the young man, called to adventure, the hero going out facing the trials and ordeals, and coming back after his victory with a boon for the community\\". =A New Hope (1977) = In a deleted scene preceding the character's first appearance in the film (preserved in the film's radio dramatization), Luke says goodbye to his best friend Biggs Darklighter, who has just joined the Imperial Academy. His childhood friends disparagingly call him \\"Wormie\\". In the original 1977 film (later having the extended title, A New Hope), Luke lives at a moisture farm on the desert planet of Tatooine with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Luke takes his first steps toward his destiny when he purchases the droids and . While examining R2-D2, he sees a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. When R2-D2 goes missing, Luke goes out to search for the droid, and is saved from a band of Tusken Raiders by Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old hermit. Luke and Obi-Wan retreat to the latter‚Äôs home, and R2-D2 plays the full message for Obi-Wan from Leia, beseeching him to help her defeat the Galactic Empire. Obi-Wan says that he and Luke's father were once Jedi Knights, and that his father was murdered by a traitorous Jedi named Darth Vader. Obi-Wan presents Luke with his father's lightsaber and offers to take him to Alderaan and train him in the ways of the Force, but Luke declines his offer, feeling obligated to continue farming for his uncle. Luke changes his mind when he returns home to find out that Imperial stormtroopers have raided the moisture farm, killing his aunt and uncle while away. He and Obi-Wan then travel to Mos Eisley, where they meet smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca at a cantina. They team up and travel on the Millennium Falcon to Alderaan, only to find out that it has been destroyed by the Death Star. The Falcon is brought into the Star's hangar bay via tractor beam, where Luke and Han disguise themselves and infiltrate the station. When they discover Princess Leia is there, Luke persuades a reluctant Han and Chewbacca to help rescue her. Obi- Wan deactivates the tractor beam, and he later sacrifices his life in a duel with Vader, so that Luke and his friends can board the Falcon and escape. During the Battle of Yavin, Luke joins the Rebel Alliance in attacking the Death Star. In the trench leading to the Death Star's exhaust port, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice, telling him to \\"trust his feelings\\"; he takes Obi-Wan's advice and switches off his X-wing's missile guidance system, instead using the Force to guide the missiles and destroy the Death Star. In the film's final scene, he joins Han and Chewbacca in receiving a medal of honor for his heroism. =The Empire Strikes Back (1980)= Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, Luke is now the commander of the Rebel Alliance's Rogue Squadron. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is captured by a wampa, but manages to escape using his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees Obi-Wan's Force ghost, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training with the Jedi Master Yoda. Luke collapses but is later rescued by Han. When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads his squadron of Snowspeeders to battle the enemy‚Äôs , but he is forced to retreat when his wingmen are overwhelmed. Escaping in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly increasing his power in the Force. During his training, Luke sees a vision of his friends in danger. Against both Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice to stay and complete his training, he travels to Bespin to save them, unwittingly falling into a trap placed by Darth Vader. He engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for Vader; the Sith Lord easily overpowers Luke and severs his right hand. Vader then reveals that he is Luke's father, and offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his side. Resolving that he would rather die than become an agent of evil, Luke throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. He survives, but is pulled into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City, and left hanging perilously onto a vane rod. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's call out to her with the Force, and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the ship, he hears Vader telepathically telling him that it is his destiny to join the dark side. Luke's severed hand is replaced with a bio-mechanical one. =Return of the Jedi (1983)= Luke Skywalker's Jedi robes from Episode VI One year after the invasion on Bespin, Luke is now a Jedi Knight, and has constructed his own lightsaber. He returns to Tatooine with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian to save Han, frozen in carbonate, from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, who rejects his offer and casts him into a pit to battle a rancor. When Luke kills the rancor, he is sentenced to death in the Sarlacc Pit. Luke escapes with R2-D2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's sail barge. Luke returns to Dagobah, and learns from a dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father. Luke then learns from Obi-Wan's spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he immediately realizes is princess Leia. Both Jedi Masters tell Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and save the galaxy, but he is disturbed by the idea of killing his own father. Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring his father back from the dark side of the Force. Vader brings Luke to the second Death Star orbiting around Endor, where his master, Emperor Palpatine, tries to tempt Luke to the dark side, revealing his plan to destroy the Rebel fleet. Luke, enraged at the thought of losing his friends, lashes out at the Emperor with his lightsaber, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son once again duel with each other. Luke regains control of his emotions until Vader senses that Luke has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit. Luke snaps and overpowers Vader, severing his father's mechanical right hand. The Emperor orders Luke to kill Vader and then take his place. Luke looks at his own bionic hand and realizes that he is on the verge of suffering his father's fate. He casts his lightsaber aside, declaring himself a Jedi. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. In agony, Luke calls out to his father for help; unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft, but is mortally wounded by the Emperor's force lightning in the process. As Rebel fighters head toward the Death Star's main reactor, Luke removes Vader's mask and looks upon his father's real face for the first and last time. The redeemed Anakin Skywalker reassures Luke that there was good in him after all before dying, and to tell his sister that he was right about him. On Endor, Luke burns his father's armor and prosthetics on a funeral pyre, giving him a proper Jedi funeral. During the Rebels' victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees his father's spirit appear alongside those of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Prequel trilogy =Revenge of the Sith (2005)= In the prequel film Revenge of the Sith (2005), during the waning days of the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists, Senator Padm√© Amidala became pregnant to Luke and his twin sister Leia. Foreseen fear of Padm√© dying from the birth of Luke and Leia became a primary catalyst into Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side as Darth Vader by Sheev Palpatine, who had secretly orchestrated the Clone Wars from both sides in order to transform the democratic Galactic Republic into the autocratic Galactic Empire mere days before Luke's birth. Anakin had sought to obtain enough power to save Padm√© from dying after going through a similar nightmare with his mother, who died at the hands of Tusken Raiders on Tatooine during Attack of the Clones 3 years prior. After becoming distrusted with the Jedi order, Anakin took Palpatine's bait that as a Sith he would learn the power of keeping the ones he cared about from dying. After following Palpatine's orders to raid the Jedi Temple and killing young Jedi aspirants, Anakin traveled to the volcanic planet Mustafar to kill off the Separatist leaders, effectively ending the Clone Wars. It was there when Padm√© arrive and learn of what Anakin had become, saying that he was breaking her heart. Following a dual between Anakin and his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi that resulted in the former being burned badly next to a lava river, Padm√© was taken to Polis Massa after being force choked by Anakin out of betrayal when Obi-Wan secretly appeared out of her starship. After giving birth to Luke and Leia, Padm√© died, having lost the will to live. At the time Darth Vader, who had been saved by Palptine and placed on a black lifesuit, wasn't aware that Padm√© had given birth to twins, believing that he killed her out of his anger. After the twins were separated in order to be protected from the Sith, Luke is taken by Obi-Wan Kenobi to the desert planet Tatooine, where Luke is adopted by his father's stepbrother, Owen Lars, and his wife, Beru. The infant Luke is portrayed by Aidan Barton, the son of Roger Barton, an editor of the film. Sequel trilogy =The Force Awakens (2015)= upright In the first installment of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens (2015), the opening crawl reveals that Luke Skywalker had mysteriously vanished some time in the thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star. Luke went into hiding after his nephew and apprentice, Ben Solo, turned to the dark side and was later dubbed Kylo Ren. When Ren killed all of his fellow apprentices and ushered in the despotic reign of the First Order, Luke felt responsible, and disappeared. At the end of the film, the Resistance manage to reconstruct a map, which traces the location of the temple from the Empire's archives to his location, and he is subsequently found on the planet Ahch-To by the young scavenger, Rey, who presents him with the lightsaber previously wielded by both Luke and his father. The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi notes that Luke's exile is a reversal from his decision to help his friends in The Empire Strikes Back. =The Last Jedi (2017)= In The Last Jedi (2017), Luke throws the lightsaber away after being given it by Rey. He then seals himself in his home, refusing to talk with Rey. However, when he sees Chewbacca without Han Solo and that Rey came on the Millennium Falcon, he inquires about what has gone on with his family. Rey informs Luke about Solo's death at the hands of Kylo Ren and that the First Order has risen to rule the galaxy. Rey asks Luke to train her in the ways of the Force. Luke is initially reluctant to train Rey, telling her that it is time for the Jedi Order to end. After some persuasion from R2-D2, Luke starts training Rey, originally for the purpose of showing her why the Jedi Order needs to end, but grows increasingly afraid of her power. Luke then tells Rey the history of the Jedi Order, how Palpatine rose to power and how the Jedi were partly responsible for Darth Vader's rise. Luke also initially tells Rey that Kylo was corrupted by Supreme Leader Snoke and that when he confronted his nephew, he retaliated by destroying his Jedi temple. This is proven false, however, and, after a furious moment with his new apprentice, Luke tells Rey that he had briefly considered killing the sleeping Ben after seeing a vision of the destruction he could cause, but immediately relented; Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber drawn and turned to the dark side because he felt betrayed. Upon learning this, Rey urges Luke to help her redeem Ben, but he refuses to participate in this nor help the Resistance, saying, \\"This is NOT going to go the way you think.\\" When Rey leaves, an embittered Luke tries to burn the Jedi temple next to his home on Ahch-To, but fails and is visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures Luke that he still has a purpose. Luke appears on the planet Crait, as the Resistance are staging a standoff against the First Order, and he apologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side. Luke steps in front of the First Order's artillery, and unexpectedly survives an onslaught of blaster fire ordered by Ren. Ren charges at Luke in hand-to-hand combat, seemingly bisecting him with his lightsaber, but Luke remains unscathed; still on Ahch- To, Luke has sent a projection of himself to Crait, using the Force. This distraction allows the Resistance to escape the planet. Luke tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi before his projection disappears. On Ahch-To, Luke collapses then looks off in the horizon to see the planet's two suns setting before he becomes one with the Force and vanishes. =The Rise of Skywalker (2019)= Luke appears briefly in The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth and final chapter of the series. When Rey discovers her lineage as the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine, she exiles herself on Ahch-To as Luke did. Meaning to isolate herself, she throws Luke's lightsaber towards the burning wreckage of the TIE fighter she had traveled there with. Luke appears as a Force ghost, and reprimands Rey for treating the lightsaber with disrespect just as he did. Luke then admits that he was wrong to not participate in the Resistance, and thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself. Luke convinces Rey to not view herself as a Palpatine, but as the good person Leia saw her as when training her, and not to give up on her battle against the Emperor. Luke lends Rey his old X-wing and tells Rey to combine his father's lightsaber with Leia's old lightsaber in her battle on Exegol. After Rey vanquishes Palpatine once and for all, she visits the moisture farm on Tatooine where Luke was raised. She buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers, revealing that she has constructed her own. A local asks Rey who she is. As Leia, who died earlier, and Luke appear as Force ghosts, Rey names herself Rey Skywalker. =Animated series= At the end of the Star Wars Rebels episode \\"Twin Suns\\", a silhouette of Luke Skywalker is seen from afar by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke appears in the animated Disney micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny (with Mark Hamill once again reprising his role). The episode \\"The Path Ahead\\" details him training with Yoda on Dagobah. He also appears in the episode \\"Traps and Tribulations\\", which takes place shortly after the Battle of Endor and shows him and Leia assisting the Ewoks in stopping a rampaging monster known as a Gorax. =Video games= Luke is a playable character in Star Wars Battlefront II, and in the online multiplayer of Star Wars Battlefront. =Literature= Luke is the main character of the novel Heir to the Jedi and the junior novel The Legends of Luke Skywalker (the latter of which was adapted as a manga). He is also a main character of the 2015 comic Star Wars, which takes place between the films of the original trilogy.  Heir to the Jedi  Star Wars: Heir to the Jedi was announced as one of the first four canon novels to be released in 2014 and 2015. Set between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Heir to the Jedi chronicles the adventures of Luke as he continues to battle the Empire with his Rebel friends and begins to develop his Force abilities. The novel is written from the first-person perspective of Luke, and is only the second Star Wars novel to attempt this type of narrative voice. =Legends= In April 2014, most of the licensed Star Wars novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film Star Wars were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the franchise. The Legends- branded novels, comic books and video games detail Luke's exploits following Return of the Jedi. Novels In the novel The Truce at Bakura, set one day after the battle of Endor, Luke and his friend Wedge Antilles recover a message droid from the titular planet, which was being invaded by the Ssi- Ruuk. Luke commands a task force, turning back the enemy army. He also meets Dev Sibwarra, a Force-sensitive human who had been captured by the Ssi-Ruuk, who is killed in the battle after turning against his captors. In the novel The Courtship of Princess Leia, set four years after the Battle of Endor, Luke travels to the planet Dathomir. There, he discovers a group of Force-sensitive witches called the Witches of Dathomir, banded into two separate groups: a collective of benign, matriarchal clans; the one he is in contact with being the Singing Mountain Clan, and the witches who have turned to the dark side, called the Nightsisters. Discovering a prophecy in which it was told a Jedi would change the way of life on the land, Luke eventually realizes truly what the Force is for the first time in his life. While there, he destroys most of the Nightsisters (including their powerful leader, Gethzirion, and the galaxy's most powerful remaining warlord, Warlord Zsinj). Thanks to the help of the prophecy and witches, Luke recovers old Jedi records left by Yoda about 400 years prior. He decides to start a new Jedi Academy, something he has been trying to do for six months before the start of the novel by finding old Jedi records and archives. In The Thrawn Trilogy, Luke meets former Emperor's Hand Mara Jade, who is bound by Palpatine's disembodied voice that repeatedly commands \\"You will kill Luke Skywalker\\". Mara Jade is working with her boss, a fringe-of-the-galaxy smuggler named Talon Karrde, who also plays a crucial role in this era. Although she was ready to fulfill that order to stop the voice, circumstances force her to keep him alive long enough to have him help escape a mutual danger. Despite her threats, Luke learns of Mara's curse and vows to free her from it. Meanwhile, the rest of the New Republic is fighting against Grand Admiral Thrawn, and thanks to Leia's help, he is eventually defeated, although Luke tried several times to get near him and his ally, Joruus C'baoth. Eventually, the desperate pair fights against Luke's clone, Luuke Skywalker, C'baoth's apprentice. During the fight, Mara Jade destroys the clone and, with Leia's help, destroys C'baoth. This entire time, C'baoth has been obsessed with \\"molding\\" Luke and Mara to serve him, perhaps due to the fact that the Spaarti cloning cylinders he was made from have a reputation of turning people insane later in life. Nonetheless, C'baoth is defeated along with Luuke, and Mara's sacrifice silences her curse and completes her reconciliation with the Jedi, whom she later joins. In the Jedi Academy trilogy, Luke resigns his commission in the New Republic's starfighter corps to pursue his Jedi studies and rebuild the Jedi Order in the Massassi Temple on Yavin 4, a decision some anti-Jedi politicians use against him. Luke becomes the New Jedi Order's leader. His students in the ways of the Force include; Gantoris, Kam Solusar, Tionne, Streen, Cilghal, Kirana Ti and others. He is forced to contend with the spirit of ancient Sith Lord Exar Kun, who lures one of his most powerful students, Kyp Durron, to the dark side. In the Hand of Thrawn Duology, Luke, now a Jedi Master, works again with Mara Jade, who has learned to better her Force knowledge since her training at Luke's Jedi Academy. He falls in love with her and they eventually marry. Later, in Edge of Victory: Rebirth, they have a son whom they name Ben, after Obi-Wan Kenobi's pseudonym. In the New Jedi Order series, Luke creates a New Jedi Council. He idealises a new conclave, made up of Jedi, politicians and military officers. Included in this new Jedi Order are Tresina Lobi, Kenth Hammer, Kyle Katarn, Kyp Durron, Cilghal, Saba Sebatynee and himself. From the politicians and military came new Chief of State Cal Omas, Admiral Sienn Sovv (Sullustan male) and four others. In Force Heretic: Remnant, he spearheads the mission into the Unknown Regions during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion to find the mysterious planet of Zonama Sekot, a planet that creates living starships. After the invasion is defeated with the help of the new Mandalorian Warriors, a Sekotian fleet and a Galactic Alliance-Imperial Remnant fleet, Luke leads the New Jedi Order on Denon, the temporary capital of the Galactic Alliance and the site of the newly rebuilt Jedi Temple on Coruscant. In The Swarm War, the New Jedi Order moves to Ossus, the site of former famous Jedi temples and libraries that were mostly destroyed 4,000 years prior. Upon the Killik's invasion of Chiss space and the transformation of most of the Myrkr mission survivors into Killik Joiners, Luke determines that the Killik's collective mind is being unconsciously controlled by a hive called the Dark Nest. The Dark Nest is controlled by a former Nightsister named Lomi Plo, who became their Unseen Queen with her ability to become invisible by exploiting the doubts of inferiors. One of the Myrkr mission survivors, Alema Rar, attempted to plant seeds of doubt in Luke's mind by suggesting that his wife, Mara, may be somehow responsible for the death of his mother, Padm√© Amidala, which he almost believes because of Mara's previous involvement as the Emperor's Hand. This allows Lomi to escape from Luke. Luke discovers recordings of his father Force-choking his mother on Mustafar, his own birth, and his mother's death hidden inside the protective memory archives of R2-D2. Because of this, he is able to overcome his doubts about Mara and defeat Lomi Plo in the final battle of the Swarm War, cutting her into four pieces. Luke also withdraws the Jedi from Cal Omas' Advisory Council, as he plans to create a New Jedi Council that will give aid to the Galactic Alliance when needed. He also becomes the Grand Master of the New Jedi Order to give the Jedi a clear sense of direction. He has told the Jedi to either follow his leadership or make the order their priority, or leave. Jedi Danni Quee and Tenel Ka have resigned because of their duties to Zonoma Sekot and Hapes, respectively, while Corran Horn tries to resign, but Luke talks him out of it. Luke is also forced to exile Tahiri, Lowbacca, and Tesar Sebatayne to Dagobah for divulging secret information to people outside the New Jedi Order. In the Legacy of the Force series, Luke begins having visions of a figure cloaked in darkness destroying the galaxy and the Jedi Decree. In his dreams, this figure's presence is much like that of Darth Vader. Luke has been troubled by the fact that he has been unable to discern the identity of this figure. Complicating matters even more is the recent schism that has developed between Luke and his nephew, Jacen Solo. Already a tremendously powerful Jedi Knight, Jacen has begun adopting radical and extreme interpretations of the Force, causing a dramatic change in his personality. Luke fears that Jacen is pursuing the same path that ultimately led to Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. In Bloodlines, the situation worsens when Luke's son, Ben, becomes Jacen's apprentice. Luke must also battle his wife, who refuses to confront Jacen for fear of alienating Ben. In Tempest, Luke determines that the dark figure from his dreams is Lumiya, a former Emperor's Hand now known as the \\"Dark Lady of the Sith\\". Luke and Lumiya had fought several times over the years, but when Mara is murdered in Sacrifice, Lumiya deceives Luke into believing that she killed her. They battle again, and Luke saves a weaponless Lumiya from falling to her death simply so that he can kill her himself. Luke returns to Coruscant where he is found by Ben, standing guard over Mara's body; upon speaking with his son, he realizes that Lumiya could not have killed her. Later in his private cabin, Luke breaks down over the death of his wife, knowing that her murderer is still at large. He does not realize that the killer is his own nephew, Jacen, who has now taken the Sith name Darth Caedus. In Revelation, Ben proves that Jacen killed Mara, but Luke is now reluctant to kill Jacen out of fear that he or his son will fall to the dark side in the process. (The decision is taken out of his hands in Invincible, when Jaina kills Jacen in a final lightsaber duel). In Fate of the Jedi novels, set about 40 years after the first film, Luke Skywalker, now in his early sixties, is deposed by the government from his position as Grand Master, and exiled from Coruscant. However, if he finds the reason of why Jacen Solo fell to the dark side, he can be allowed to return. Ben insists on coming with him. Together, father and son explore dangerous and little-known portions of the galaxy. Luke and Ben learn much about each other, about the Force, and about the great dangers threatening the Jedi. The great love the two surviving Skywalkers have for each other grows even greater as they repeatedly save each other's lives and explore the limits and powers and mysteries of the Force. =Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor= Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor is a standalone novel that chronicles the Battle of Mindor, a fictional event in the Star Wars expanded universe. The novel was written by Matthew Stover and released in December 2008. The novel is set shortly after Return of the Jedi and the novel Prophets of the Dark Side, with Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance attempting to stop Lord Shadowspawn and his \\"shadow stormtroopers\\", culminating in the Battle of Mindor. Matthew Stover has said on his personal weblog, Comic books Luke Skywalker appears in the Marvel-published Star Wars comics adaptations of the original trilogy, as well as an ongoing series that ran from 1977‚Äì86. When Dark Horse acquired the license two years later, he appeared in numerous projects based on the franchise as well. In Star Wars: Legacy, set 125 years after the events of the original films, Luke appears as a spirit in the Force to his descendant Cade Skywalker and persuades him to once again become a Jedi in order to defeat the evil Darth Krayt and his burgeoning Sith empire. Video games An older and wiser Luke Skywalker also appears in the Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy video games at the rank of Jedi Master. In Jedi Outcast, Luke helps Kyle Katarn in his fight against Desann and Empire Reborn by driving them away from the Valley of the Jedi. Luke appears in the game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed in a downloadable alternate storyline where Starkiller duels Luke. He also appears in the Disney Lucasfilm video game Star Wars Commander. Luke is also a playable character in Disney Infinity 3.0.  Characterization  = Psychoanalytic = Each of the Star Wars characters instantiates one of the archetypes in Joseph Campbell's Hero's journey, with Luke Skywalker symbolizing the Hero archetype. As such, he is a formulaic, relatable protagonist who encounters the basic struggle between good and evil in the same way as other heroic figures such as Harry Potter, Bilbo Baggins, and Jesus Christ. Luke's central dilemma is the ongoing war between good and evil, both externally and internally. = Religious = Some argue that Luke mirrors fundamental values of Christianity and Abrahamic religion; Luke's journey is often compared to that of Jesus Christ. Scholars argue that Luke is a Christ-like figure, while Yoda represents a god and Darth Vader represents the temptations of evil. Luke's struggle between good and evil is contrasted with that of his father, Anakin Skywalker, in a way that represents the story of the Prodigal Son. Concept and creation Luke was variously conceived of as a 60-year-old grizzled war hero, later as a Jedi Master, and as a woman. In an interview about his early drafts, Lucas said: > The first [version] talked about a princess and an old general. The second > version involved a father, his son, and his daughter; the daughter was the > heroine of the film. Now the daughter has become Luke, Mark Hamill's > character. There was also the story of two brothers where I transformed one > of them into a sister. The older brother was imprisoned, and the young > sister had to rescue him and bring him back to their dad. Though Luke's surname was \\"Skywalker\\" in Lucas's 1973 treatment of The Star Wars, it was changed to \\"Starkiller\\" in subsequent drafts, at one point featuring in the title (The Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller). The \\"Starkiller\\" surname remained for the first few months of production; Hamill used the name \\"Luke Starkiller\\" the sole time he referred to himself during filming (dubbed \\"Skywalker\\" in the film). \\"Starkiller\\" was dropped due to what Lucas called \\"unpleasant connotations\\" with Charles Manson. An alternative ending pitched by George Lucas for Return of the Jedi was Luke assuming his father's role as Darth Vader after the latter's death and intending to rule in his place. Though Lawrence Kasdan favored the idea, Lucas ultimately declined, since the films were made for children. Another conclusion to the film featured the character disappearing into the wilderness akin to \\"Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti westerns.\\" According to Mark Hamill, during the filming of the original Star Wars film, George Lucas asked him if he would reprise the role for a cameo when he was in his 60s to pass the torch to the next generation. In 1983, Hamill stated that his return to the franchise would be \\"either be another plane of existence or not the same character\\". Hamill learned of the sequel trilogy over the summer of 2012 at a Star Wars Celebration during lunch when Lucas told him one was in development. Hamill recalled shaving his beard to portray the Trickster in The Flash, then letting it grow back for the filming of Star Wars. Luke's lack of screen time in The Force Awakens was due to concerns by screenwriter Michael Arndt that his presence would mean the audience would have less interest in protagonist Rey, leading to an agreement that he be removed from the screen and instead become a plot device. Hamill attended meetings for script readings, and helped conceal Luke's role in the film; instead of dialogue, he read stage directions. Abrams said it allowed him to remain involved and that his reading helped make a \\"better experience for everyone\\". According to concept designer Christian Alzmann, Luke's appearance in The Last Jedi was partly inspired by that of Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979). Reception In 2015, Luke Skywalker was selected by Empire magazine as the 50th-greatest movie character of all time. Empire also ranked him as the third greatest Star Wars character. Luke was also on the ballot for the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains. On their list of the 100 Greatest Fictional Characters, Fandomania.com ranked Luke at number 14. IGN listed Luke as their 4th top Star Wars character, and he was chosen twice by IGN's readers as one of their favorite Star Wars characters. IGN's Jesse Schedeen also picked Luke Skywalker as one of the characters they most wanted to appear on the Wii, as well as listing Skywalker as one of their favorite Star Wars heroes. Schedeen also listed the character as one of the Star Wars characters they wanted to see in Soulcalibur. IGN also called the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi one of the ultimate movie \\"boss battles\\". In a feature on speeches made by Luke Skywalker, IGN's Todd Gilchrist said that his favorite speech made by Luke was \\"I am a Jedi, like my father before me\\". UGO Networks listed Luke as one of their best heroes of all time, and he was voted as one of the coolest Star Wars characters by UGO's readers. Inventor Dean Kamen has also code-named his new prosthetic arm system \\"Luke\\" in honor of the character. Mark Hamill was nominated a Saturn Award for Best Actor in for his portrayal of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars, and won the award for his portrayal in The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Last Jedi. In 1976, Mark Hamill had a serious car accident after filming Star Wars, which involved an operation on his face. It was speculated that the Wampa attack at the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back was written in to explain his facial injuries, but George Lucas specifically disputed this in the DVD commentary of The Empire Strikes Back. In regards to Luke's portrayal in The Last Jedi, many fans expressed disappointment in how he was depicted \\"as a grumpy old man whose failures had driven him into hiding\\" and the actions the character takes in contributing to Kylo Ren's backstory, a stark departure in how Luke was characterized in the original trilogy. Hamill originally stated that he \\"pretty much fundamentally [disagreed] with every choice [The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson] made for this character,\\" but that he had the utmost respect for Johnson and was willing to do his part to realize Johnson's vision. While regarding the possibility of a younger actor playing the role, Hamill expressed support towards Sebastian Stan, whose physical resemblance to a young Hamill went viral.https://www.inverse.com/article/38508-sebastian- stan-mark-hamill-star-wars-young-luke-skywalker However he noted that child actor Jacob Tremblay would be his top choice if the story were to be focused on a very young Luke.https://variety.com/video/mark-hamill-trump-tweets-young- luke-skywalker/ In 2016, when asked about the character's sexual orientation and if Luke could be gay, Hamill said Luke's sexual orientation \\"is meant to be interpreted by the viewer.\\" He added, \\"if you think Luke is gay, of course he is. You should not be ashamed of it. Judge Luke by his character, not by who he loves.\\" Hamill later said that he considered the possibility that Luke could have found love between Episode VI and Episode VII. Cultural impact Skywalker remains an American icon. In fact, Luke Skywalker is often still used by child psychotherapists to help children to project their thoughts and state of being in a way that is understandable to both the child and their therapist. Another way that therapists utilize Star Wars in sessions is to teach their patients that the Force represents the self-understanding that they achieve in therapy. Children are taught that they are Luke and their therapist is Obi-Wan as eventually, as Luke no longer needed his mentor, patients will one day no longer need their therapist. Star Wars has been related back to cultural events of its time, such as the Cold War and Nixon- era politics. The severing of Luke's hand and Darth Vader's bionic presence supposedly, according to space.com, symbolize the unity of the military and amputees.

His essay Ornament and Crime advocated smooth and clear surfaces in contrast to the lavish decorations of the fin de si√®cle, as well as the more modern aesthetic principles of the Vienna Secession, exemplified in his design of Looshaus, Vienna. Loos became a pioneer of modern architecture and contributed a body of theory and criticism of Modernism in architecture and design and developed the \\"Raumplan\\" (literally spatial plan) method of arranging interior spaces, exemplified in Villa M√ºller in Prague. Loos had three tumultuous marriages that all ended in divorce. He suffered from poor health, including an inherited hearing affliction. He was convicted as a pedophile in 1928 for exploiting girls from poor families, aged 8 to 10. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna. Early life Loos was born on 10 December 1870 in Brno, in the Margraviate of Moravia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the eastern part of the Czech Republic. His father, a German stonemason, died when Loos was nine years old. Young Adolf Loos had inherited his father's hearing impairment and was significantly handicapped by it throughout his life. His mother continued to carry on the stonemason business after her husband's death. Loos attended several Gymnasium schools, a technical school in Liberec and graduated 1889 from a technical school in Brno. He later studied at Dresden University of Technology. He left one year later without completing his study. Career At age 23, Loos traveled to the United States and stayed there for three years from 1893‚Äì96. While in the United States, he mainly lived with relatives in the Philadelphia area, supported himself with odd jobs and also visited other cities such as the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, St. Louis and New York. Loos returned to Vienna in 1896 and made it his permanent residence. He was a prominent figure in the city and a friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Peter Altenberg and Karl Kraus. Inspired by his years in the New World he devoted himself to architecture. After briefly associating himself with the Vienna Secession in 1896, he rejected the style and advocated a new, plain, unadorned architecture. A utilitarian approach to use the entire floor plan completed his concept. Loos's early commissions consisted of interior designs for shops and caf√©s in Vienna. =Architectural theory= Loos authored several polemical works. In Spoken into the Void, published in 1900, he attacked the Vienna Secession, at a time when the movement was at its height. In his essays, Loos used provocative catchphrases and is noted for the essay/manifesto entitled Ornament and Crime, given in a lecture in 1910 and first published in 1913.Janet Stewart, Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism, London: Routledge, 2000, p. 173 He explored the idea that the progress of culture is associated with the deletion of ornament from everyday objects, and that it was therefore a crime to force craftsmen or builders to waste their time on ornamentation that served to hasten the time when an object would become obsolete (design theory). Loos' stripped-down buildings influenced the minimal massing of modern architecture, and stirred controversy. Although noted for the lack of ornamentation on their exteriors, the interiors of many of Loos's buildings are finished with rich and expensive materials, notably stone, marble and wood, displaying natural patterns and textures in flat planes, executed in first rate craftsmanship. The distinction is not between complicated and simple, but between \\"organic\\" and superfluous decoration. Loos was also interested in the decorative arts, collecting sterling silver and high quality leather goods, which he noted for their plain yet luxurious appeal. He also enjoyed fashion and men's clothing, designing the famed Kn√≠≈æe of Vienna, a haberdashery. His admiration for the fashion and culture of England and America can be seen in his short-lived publication Das Andere, which ran for just two issues in 1903 and included advertisements for 'English' clothing. In 1920, he had a brief collaboration with Frederick John Kiesler - architect, theater and art-exhibition designer. =Loos House and other projects= From 1904 on, he was able to carry out big projects; the most notable was the so-called \\"Looshaus\\" (built from 1910‚Äì12), originally for the Viennese tailor Goldman and Salatsch, for whom Loos had designed a store interior in 1898, and situated right across from the Habsburg city residence Hofburg Palace. The house, today located at the address Michaelerplatz 3, Vienna, and under monument preservation, was criticized by its contemporaries. The facade was dominated by rectilinear window patterns and a lack of stucco decoration and awnings, which earned it the nickname \\"House without Eyebrows\\"; Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was said to have despised the modern building so much that he avoided leaving the Hofburg Palace through a main gate in its vicinity. His work also includes the store of the men's fashion house Knize (built 1909‚Äì13), Am Graben 13, Caf√© Museum (built 1899), Operngasse 7, Vienna, and the \\"American Bar\\" (built 1907‚Äì08), K√§rntnerstrasse 10, Vienna. Loos visited the island of Skyros in 1904 and was influenced by the cubic architecture of the Greek islands. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I Loos was awarded Czechoslovakian citizenship by President Masaryk. His main place of residence remained in Vienna. During the First Austrian Republic Loos became interested in public projects. He designed several housing projects for the City of Vienna, which was then nicknamed Red Vienna. From 1924‚Äì28 Loos lived in Paris. He taught at the Sorbonne and was contracted to build a house for Tristan Tzara, which was completed 1925 on Avenue Junot 15, Paris. In 1928 he returned to Vienna. Loos had an admiration for classical architecture,Hanno-Walter Kruft. A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present. Princeton Architectural Press, 1994 and Edward Chaney, Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook, 2006) page 361 which is reflected in his writings and his entry to the 1922 Chicago Tribune competition. Loos' submission was a massive doric column.  Private life  =Marriages= Loos was married three times. In July 1902, he married drama student . The marriage ended three years later in 1905. In 1919, he married 20-year-old Austrian-born Elsie Altmann, a dancer and operetta star and daughter of Adolf Altmann and Jeannette Gruenblatt. They divorced seven years later in 1926. In 1929 he married writer and photographer Claire Beck. She was the daughter of his clients Otto and Olga Beck, and 35 years his junior. They were divorced on 30 April 1932. Following their divorce, Claire Loos wrote Adolf Loos Privat, a literary work of snapshot-like vignettes about Loos's character, habits and sayings, published by the Johannes-Presse in Vienna in 1936. The book was intended to raise funds for Loos's tomb. =Poor health= All his life, Loos suffered from a hearing impairment. When he was a child, he was deaf. He only acquired partial hearing at the age of 12. In 1918 Loos was diagnosed with cancer. His stomach, appendix and part of his intestine were removed. By the time he was 50 he was nearly deaf. =Child abuse= In 1928 Loos was disgraced by a pedophilia scandal in Vienna. He had commissioned young girls, aged 8 to 10, from poor families to act as models in his studio. The indictment stated that Loos had exposed himself and forced his young models to participate in sexual acts. He was found partially guilty in a court decision of 1928. In 2008 the original case record was rediscovered and confirmed the accusation.Christopher Long, Der Fall Loos. Amalthea 2015. Death and legacy Villa M√ºller in Prague Adolf Loos exhibited early signs of dementia around the time of his court proceedings. A few months before his death he suffered a stroke. He died aged 62 on 23 August 1933 in Kalksburg near Vienna. Loos's body was taken to Vienna's Zentralfriedhof to rest among the great artists and musicians of the city, including Schoenberg, Altenberg and Kraus, some of his closest friends and associates. Through his writings and his groundbreaking projects in Vienna, Loos was able to influence other architects and designers, and the early development of Modernism. His careful selection of materials, passion for craftsmanship and use of 'Raumplan'‚Äîthe considered ordering and size of interior spaces based on function‚Äîare still admired.

His works include the Museum of Modern Art, in New York City, the United States Embassy in New Delhi, India, The Keller Center at the University of Chicago, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Life and work Stone was born and raised in Fayetteville, Arkansas. He attended the University of Arkansas, Harvard and M.I.T., but did not earn a degree. In 1927 he won the Rotch Travelling Scholarship, which afforded him the opportunity to travel through Europe on a two-year stipend.\\"Tech Student Wins Rotch Scholarship,\\" Boston Herald, May 4, 1927. Stone was impressed by the new architecture he observed in Europe, buildings designed in what would come to be known as the International Style. He returned to the United States in 1929 and took up residence in Manhattan. Hired by the architectural firm of Schultze and Weaver, he designed interiors for the new Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He subsequently worked for the Associated Architects of Rockefeller Center and became the principal designer of Radio City Music Hall. Richard H. Mandel house, Mt. Kisco, New York (1933) Stone was an early advocate of the International Style. His first independent commission was the Richard H. Mandel House, in Mount Kisco, New York (1933).\\"House of Richard H. Mandel,\\" Architectural Forum, August 1935. This was followed by the Ulrich Kowalski house, also in Mt. Kisco (1934),\\"Recent Work by Edward D. Stone,\\" Architectural Forum, July 1941. and the Albert C. Koch house in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1936).\\"Grand Prize: Prize Houses Over $12,000,\\" Architectural Forum, January 1939. In 1936 Stone was chosen as associate architect for the new Museum of Modern Art in New York City, designed in collaboration with Phillip Goodwin.\\"Current Architecture: The Museum of Modern Art, New York City,\\" Architectural Review, September 1939. Stone also designed a private residence for MoMA president Anson Conger Goodyear in Old Westbury, NY (1938).\\"Recent Work by Edward D. Stone\\". Both the Mandel and Goodyear residences are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places Single Property Listings Finding Aid: New York, (Tucson: National Park Service Intermountain Region Museum Services Program, 2017). At the outset of World War II Stone enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was promoted to the rank of major and served as chief of the Army Air Force Planning and Design Section. Returning to New York after the war, Stone was commissioned to design the ten-story El Panama Hotel in Panama City, Panama (1946), the University of Arkansas Fine Arts Center in Fayetteville (1948),\\"University Art Center‚ÄîArchitect Stone‚Äôs sure hand with countless details creates a harmonious home for seven arts under one Arkansas roof,\\" Architectural Forum, September 1951. and the 850-bed Hospital del Seguro Social del Empleado in Lima, Peru (1950).\\"Big Double Hospital: Skillful handling of traffic and service flow by US architects integrates maternity and general health facilities for 850 Peruvian inpatients,\\" Architectural Forum, June 1952. U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India (1959) Stone‚Äôs best-known work was the Embassy of the United States in New Delhi, India (1959). Tasked with creating a modern building that respected the architectural heritage of its host country, he designed a temple-like pavilion on a raised podium.Jane C. Loeffler, The Architecture of Diplomacy (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1998). Frank Lloyd Wright called the embassy one of the most beautiful buildings he had ever seen,\\"It's news when Wright lauds an architect,\\" Palo Alto Times, August 3, 1955. and it won a first honor award from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Subsequent commissions such as the Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California (1955),\\"Medicine‚Äôs new 'Taj Mahal',\\" Architectural Forum, April 1958. the Stuart Pharmaceutical Company in Pasadena, California (1956),\\"Splendor in the Factory,\\" Architectural Record, December 1959. and the United States pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World‚Äôs Fair (1957),\\"A final look at Brussels,\\" Architectural Forum, October 1958. repeated elements originally designed for the embassy.Steven Bedford, \\"Stone, Edward Durell,\\" in Encyclopedia of Architecture Design, Engineering & Construction, ed. by Joseph A. Wilkes and Robert T. Packard (New York: Wiley, 1989). The Stuart building and World‚Äôs Fair pavilion both won awards from the AIA, and Stone was elected to the Institute‚Äôs College of Fellows in 1958. Described as romanticist, Stone‚Äôs ornate designs brought him commercial success. By the 1960s his firm was among the largest architectural practices in the United States, with over 200 employees and offices on both coasts.\\"100 Largest Architectural Firms in the U.S.,\\" Architectural Forum, April 1963; \\"100 Largest Architectural Firms in the U.S.,\\" Architectural Forum, April 1964; \\"Man with a billion on the drawing board,\\" Business Week, October 8, 1966.

But the lopsided European proportion of his recent workload has concerned the silver-haired, Newark, N.J.-born architect.\\" He grew up in nearby Maplewood,Hilarie M. Sheets (January 24, 2014), Architect Goes Home, to Recall and to Work New York Times. where he attended Columbia High School. He earned a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Cornell University in 1957. After graduating, Meier traveled to Israel, Greece, Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, and Italy, among other places, to network with architects. Meier is also the second cousin of Peter Eisenman, an architect, theorist, and fellow member of The New York Five. Career Richard Meier (1986) In New York City, Meier worked for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill briefly in 1959, and then for Marcel Breuer for three years, prior to starting his own practice in 1963. In 1972, he was identified as one of The New York Five, a group of modernist architects: Meier, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, and John Hejduk. Early in his career, Meier worked with artists such as painter Frank Stella and favored structures that were white and geometric. Meier first gained significant recognition for his designs of various residences, in addition to The Atheneum in New Harmony, Indiana (1979) and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia (1983). Getty Center Although Meier was an acclaimed architect for many years, his design of the Getty Center, a massive museum complex in Los Angeles, California, which opened in 1997, catapulted him into mainstream recognition. Some of his other notable commissions include museums such as the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art in Spain (1995) and the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, California (1996); The Hague, The Netherlands City Hall (1995) and San Jose City Hall (2005); commercial buildings such as the reconstruction of City Tower in Prague, Czech Republic (2008); and residential buildings such as 173 and 176 Perry Street in the West Village of Manhattan (2002) and Meier on Rothschild in Tel Aviv, Israel (2015). Today, Richard Meier & Partners Architects has offices in New York and Los Angeles, with projects ranging from China and Tel Aviv to Paris and Hamburg. Much of Meier's work builds on the work of architects of the early to mid-20th century, especially that of Le Corbusier, particularly his early work. Meier is considered to have built more using Corbusier's ideas than anyone, including Le Corbusier himself. Meier expanded many ideas evident in Le Corbusier's work, particularly the Villa Savoye and the Swiss Pavilion. His work also reflects the influences of other designers such as Mies Van der Rohe and, in some instances, Frank Lloyd Wright and Luis Barrag√°n (without the colour). White has been used in many architectural landmark buildings throughout history, including cathedrals and the white-washed villages of the Mediterranean region, in Spain, southern Italy and Greece. The Mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, included in his campaign platform a promise to tear down the large travertine wall of Meier's Museum of the Ara Pacis. Alemmano has since changed his stance on the building and has agreed with Meier to modifications including drastically reducing the height of the wall between an open-air space outside the museum and a busy road along the Tiber river. The city plans to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. \\"It's an improvement,\\" says Meier, adding that \\"the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one.\\" The mayor's office said Alemanno hopes to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013. Recognition In 1984, Meier was awarded the Pritzker Prize. The jury citation declared that Meier has \\"created structures which are personal, vigorous, original.\\" In 2008, he won the gold medal in architecture from the Academy of Arts and Letters\\"Academy of Arts and Letters Announces Award Winners\\", Artinfo, April 17, 2008. accessdate=2008-05-19 and his work Jesolo Lido Village was awarded the Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building. Meier is a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.Design Futures Council Senior Fellows He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal in 1997. In 2013, he was awarded the A+ Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1996, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2010, Cornell established a new professorship named for Meier. Paying tribute Meier on the occasion of his firm's 50th anniversary, the Fondazione Bisazza presented the exhibition ‚ÄúRichard Meier: Architecture and Design‚Äù in Vicenza, Italy.Ellie Stathaki (May 17, 2013), Richard Meier exhibition and installation at Fondazione Bisazza Wallpaper. In 2014, Meier opened a 15,000-square-foot exhibition space museum at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City. The space gathers much of his life's work under one roof, and replaces a much smaller version that opened in 2007 in Long Island City, Queens, and that until 2013 was open only by appointment to students and tour groups. The new venue provides room to show his own sculptures, architectural drawings and collages for the first time, and is planned to include a research library. Getty Center.  Sexual harassment and resignation  On March 13, 2018, The New York Times detailed allegations from five women that Meier had sexually harassed or assaulted them. Meier responded by saying that he would take a leave of six months from his firm. In response to the allegations and Meier's apology, his alma mater Cornell University declined his intended endowment of a named chair and instituted a review of his previous donations. On April 6, 2018, an additional four women who formerly worked at Meier's architecture firm came forward with allegations against him. The most recent allegations dated to 2009. On October 9, 2018, the firm announced that his resignation was permanent. In actuality he never resigned and remains a presence in the office.

Portman also had a particularly large impact on the cityscape of his hometown of Atlanta, with the Peachtree Center complex serving as downtown's business and tourism anchor from the 1970s onward. The Peachtree Center area includes Portman-designed Hyatt, Westin, and Marriott hotels. Portman's plans typically deal with primitives in the forms of symmetrical squares and circles. Early life and career Portman was born to John C. Portman, Sr. and Edna Rochester Portman. He had five sisters. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1950. His firm completed the Merchandise Mart (now AmericasMart) in downtown Atlanta in 1961. The multi-block Peachtree Center was begun in 1965 and would expand to become the main center of hotel and office space in Downtown Atlanta, taking over from the Five Points area just to the south. Portman would develop a similar multiblock complex at San Francisco's Embarcadero Center (1970s), which unlike its Atlanta counterpart, heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level. The Hyatt Regency Atlanta, Portman's first atrium hotel, would lead to many more iconic hotels and multi- use complexes with atria, including the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles (1974‚Äì1976), the New York Marriott Marquis (1982‚Äì1985), and the Renaissance Center in Detroit (first phase 1973-1977), whose central tower remained the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere until the completion of 1717 Broadway in 2013. His signature work in China, the Shanghai Centre (1990), was the first of many major projects in China and elsewhere in Asia. The 5-star hotel inside, The Portman Ritz-Carlton, Shanghai (formerly Portman Shangri-La Hotel), was named after him. In 2009 Portman's work was featured in a major exhibition at Atlanta's High Museum of Art. Portman was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. Personal life Portman married Joan \\"Jan\\" Newton. They had six children. Portman died on December 29, 2017, aged 93. He was survived, among others, by his wife and five of his children, as well as his daughter-in-law, actress Traylor Howard, and three of his five siblings.

In the 1960s and 1970s the placement of such buildings in America's decaying downtowns was considered salvation of the city centers, but some contemporary city planners are critical of such insular environments that \\"turn their back\\" on the city streets. For example, the New York Marriott Marquis with its 8-floor high lobby was praised as a \\"town square\\", but is now criticized by some for turning its back to Times Square. Nonetheless, at the time the hotel was built, due to the still-seedy character of Times Square, Portman's style of inwardly-oriented spaces made logical sense. Also, he did, in fact, design buildings (like San Francisco's Embarcadero Center) that heavily emphasized pedestrian activity at street level.

Said to have died at the age of 969, he lived the longest of all figures mentioned in the Bible. According to the Book of Genesis, Methuselah was the son of Enoch, the father of Lamech, and the grandfather of Noah. Elsewhere in the Bible, Methuselah is mentioned in genealogies in 1st Chronicles and the Gospel of Luke. His life is described in further detail in extra-biblical religious texts such as the Book of Enoch, Slavonic Enoch, and the Book of Moses. Bible commentators have offered various explanations as to why the Book of Genesis describes him as having died at such an advanced age; some believe that Methuselah's age is the result of a mistranslation, while others believe that his age is used to give the impression that part of Genesis takes place in a very distant past. Methuselah's name has become synonymous with longevity, and he has been portrayed and referenced in film, television and music. In the Bible Methuselah is a biblical patriarch mentioned in , as part of the genealogy linking Adam to Noah. The following is taken from the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible: :21 When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah. :22 Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters. :23 Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years. :24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him. :25 When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech. :26 Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and had other sons and daughters. :27 Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.  According to the chronology of the Bible, Methuselah died during the year of the flood; He was also the oldest of all the figures mentioned in the Bible. Methuselah is mentioned once in the Hebrew Bible outside of Genesis; in , he is mentioned in a genealogy of Saul. Methuselah is mentioned a single time in the New Testament, when the Gospel of Luke traces Jesus of Nazareth's lineage back to Adam in Luke 3 (). In other religious texts A depiction of Methuselah at the Church of San Juan Bautista in Carbonero el Mayor, Segovia Province, Spain. The apocryphal Book of Enoch claims to be revelations of Enoch, transcribed by him and entrusted to be preserved for future generations by his son, Methuselah. In this book, Enoch recounts two visions he has had to Methuselah. The first is about the Genesis flood narrative, and the second chronicles the history of the world from Adam to the Last Judgment. In the latter vision, men are represented as animals - the righteous are white cattle and sheep, the sinners and enemies of Israel are black cattle and wild animals. Following his father's death in the Book of Enoch, Methuselah is designated by God as a priest, while Methuselah's grandson, Noah's brother Nir, is designated by God as his successor. In Slavonic Enoch, Methuselah asks his father for a blessing, and is given instructions on how to live righteously. After their father ascends into heaven, Methuselah and his brothers build an altar and made \\"a great festivity, praising God who had given such a sign by means of Enoch, who had found favor with Him.\\" The Book of Jubilees presents itself as \\"the history of the division of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the jubilees of the world\\" and claims to be a revelation of God to Moses, given through the Angel of the Presence in addition to the written Law received by Moses on Mount Sinai; and, while the written Law was to be imparted to all, this was to be a secret tradition entrusted only to the saints of each generation, to Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, and Shem, then to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Levi, and finally to the priests and scribes of the latter times. Rabbinic literature states that when Noah was four hundred and eighty years old all the righteous men were dead, except Methuselah and himself, who were of immense stature as they were descended from the sons of God. At God's command they both announced that one hundred and twenty years would be given to men for repentance; if in that time they had not mended their evil ways, the earth would be destroyed. But their plea was in vain; even while Noah was engaged in building the ark the wicked made sport of him and his work, saying: \\"If the Flood should come, it could not harm us. We are too tall; and, moreover, we could close up with our feet [which were of monstrous size] the springs from below.\\" They resorted to these tactics; but God heated the water, and their feet and the flesh of their bodies was scalded. The 17th century midrashic Sefer haYashar (\\"Book of Jasher\\")Sefer Ha-Yashar: Or, the Book of Jasher (1887), Salt Lake City: J. Parry & Co. describes Methuselah with his grandson Noah attempting to persuade the people of the earth to return to godliness.(Jasher 5:7) All other very long-lived people died, and Methuselah was the only one of this class left.(Jasher 5:21) God planned to bring the flood after all the men who walked in the ways of the Lord had died (besides Noah and his family).(Jasher 4:20) Methuselah lived until the ark was built, but died before the flood, since God had promised he would not be killed with the unrighteous. The Sefer haYashar gives Methuselah's age at death as 960.(Jasher 5:36) Methuselah (Arabic: Matt≈´shalakh) is also mentioned in Islam in the various collections of tales of the pre-Islamic prophets, which also say he was an ancestor of Noah. Furthermore, early Islamic historians like Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Hisham always included his name in the genealogy of Muhammad.Ibn IshƒÅq, Sƒ´rat Ras≈´l AllƒÅh, tr. A. Guillaume (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 3 The Book of Moses, a Mormon text, says that after Enoch and the City of Zion were taken up to heaven, Methusaleh stayed behind; this was so that God's promises to Enoch - that he would always have descendants on earth and that he would be an ancestor of Noah - would be fulfilled. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints further teaches that Methuselah was a prophet. Interpretations Bartolom√© Bermejo, Christ Leading the Patriarchs to Paradise, c. 1480. In this depiction of the Harrowing of Hell, Methuselah is portrayed as leading the procession of the righteous behind Jesus, along with Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, and Adam and Eve. =Literal= Interpretations of the Bible following biblical literalism take Methuselah's 969 years to be 969 solar years. Some literalists attempt to give certain arguments for how this could be: early humans had a better diet, or a water vapor canopy protected the earth from radiation before the Flood.John C. Whitcomb, Jr. and Henry M. Morris, \\"The Genesis Flood\\" (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1961), 399‚Äì404 Others introduce theological causes: humans were originally to have everlasting life, but sin was introduced into the world by Adam and Eve, its influence became greater with each generation, and God progressively shortened human life, particularly after the Flood. The Catholic Encyclopedia says \\"Certain exegetes solve the difficulty to their own satisfaction by declaring that the year meant by the sacred writer is not the equivalent of our year.\\" =Mistranslation= Some believe that Methuselah's extreme age is the result of an ancient mistranslation that converted \\"months\\" to \\"years\\", producing a more credible 969 lunar months, or 78¬Ω years, but the same calculation applied to Enoch would have him fathering Methuselah at the age of 5 using numbers from the Masoretic Text. Donald V. Etz suggested that the Genesis 5 numbers \\"might for convenience have all been multiples of 5 or 10\\". Ellen Bennet argued that the Septuagint Genesis 5 numbers are in tenths of years, which \\"will explain how it was that they read 930 years for the age of Adam instead of 93 years, and 969 years for Methuselah instead of 96 years, and 950 years for that of Noah instead of 95 years\\"... \\"Surely it is much more rational to conclude that Noah lived 50 years instead of 500 years before he took a wife and begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth...\\" and then lists the Septuagint total ages with decimal points: 93.0 for Adam, 91.0 for Cainan, 96.9 for Methuselah, 95.0 for Noah, etc. =Myth= Yigal Levin states that these long lifespans are intended simply to speed the reader from Adam to Noah. Claus Westermann states they are intended to create the impression of a distant past. The Sumerian King List mentions a character named Ubara-Tutu who seems almost identical to Methuselah. He was the son of En-men-dur-ana, a Sumerian mythological figure often compared to Enoch, as he entered heaven without dying. Ubara-Tutu was the king of Sumer until a flood swept over his land. Although the ages of Methuselah and Ubara-Tutu are different, they both died in a Great Flood.Pritchard, James B. (ed.), Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1955, 1969). 1950 1st edition at Google Books. p.44: \\"...a flood [will sweep] over the cult- centers; to destroy the seed of mankind; is the decision, the word of the assembly [of the gods].\\" Babylonian writer Berossus also claims that, prior to the events of Babylon's flood myth, kings could live for tens of thousands of years, which bears some similarity to Genesis 5. In Forever Young: A Cultural History of Longevity, Lucian Boia says that the Bible's portrayal of Methuselah and other long lived figures features \\"traces of the Mesopatamian legends\\" found in the Epic of Gilgamesh, where Gilgamesh rules Uruk for 126 years, and his ancestors are said to have ruled for several hundred years each. Boia also notes that tales of kings who lived for thousands of years can be found in both Indian and Chinese mythology, and that the Bible is comparatively \\"restrained\\" in depicting early humans as being able to live for hundreds of years, rather than thousands. Boia notes that following the Flood, the Bible depicts its character's lifespans as gradually diminishing; Noah's sons lived between 400 and 500 years, while Abraham died at 175, Moses died at 120, and David died at 70, an age that the Bible portrays as old for David's time period. Boia compares early biblical figures and their vast lifespans to the people of the Golden Age in Hesiod's poem Works and Days, whose bodies are perpetually youthful. =Symbolic= Methuselah's father Enoch, who does not die but is taken by God, is the seventh patriarch, and Methuselah, the eighth, dies in the year of the Flood, which ends the ten-generational sequence from Adam to Noah, in whose time the world is destroyed.Abraham Malamat, \\"King Lists of the Old Babylonian Period and Biblical Genealogies,\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 88 (1968): 165. See also the discussion of \\"ten\\" in the Gen. genealogies in M. Abot section 5, Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1988), 685. Duane A. Garrett also thinks this is deliberate, thus indicating redaction, Rethinking Genesis: The Sources and Authorship of the First Book of the Bible, Ross- shire, Great Britain: Christian Focus Publications, 2000, p. 99. Boia believes that Methuselah serves the symbolic function of linking the Creation and the Flood, as Adam would have died during Methuselah's lifetime and Methuselah could have learned about the Garden of Eden from Adam. The kings of the Sumerian King List lived for over a thousand years, and Mesopotamians believed both that living over a thousand years made someone divine or somewhat divine, and that their contemporary kings were descended from the kings of the Sumerian King List. Robert Gnuse hypothesizes that the author of Genesis made all of its characters die before they turned one-thousand as a polemic against these Mesopotamian beliefs, as well as any claim that a king is divine. Gnuse also believes that the author of Genesis said that Methuselah died before he lived a thousand years to show that he was not divine. Cultural influence Methuselah According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Methuselah's name \\"has become a synonym for longevity\\". Saying that someone is \\"as old as Methuselah\\" is a humorous way of saying that someone is very elderly. The word \\"Methuselarity,\\" a blend of Methuselah and singularity, was coined by Aubrey de Grey to mean a future point in time when all of the medical conditions that cause human death would be eliminated, and death would occur only by accident or homicide. A -year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) tree growing high in the White Mountains of Inyo County in eastern California is called Methuselah. The lyrics of Ira Gershwin's song \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\" (1935) cast doubt on various aspects of the Bible, such as the idea that Methuselah lived so long, the idea that the devil is evil, the story of Jonah, and the story of David and Goliath. The character Flint from the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\" is a nearly-immortal man who was born in ancient Mesopotamia. His identities include Methuselah, Alexander the Great, Solomon, Lazarus of Bethany, Leonardo da Vinci and Johannes Brahms. Flint becomes lonely after living for a time on a deserted planet, and creates an immortal gynoid to keep him company. He eventually begins to slowly die because he left Earth's atmosphere, and dedicates the remainder of his days to the betterment of Mankind. Anthony Hopkins played Methuselah in Darren Aronofsky's 2014 film Noah. In the film, Noah's adopted daughter Ila (played by Emma Watson) is infertile until Methuselah blesses her. Aronofsky's version of Methuselah is a hermit who lives on a mountaintop. In this retelling of the Genesis flood narrative, Methuselah dies during the deluge. In the TV series Altered Carbon, based on Richard K. Morgan's 2002 novel of the same name, a class of people who can afford to live forever by transferring their consciousness into cloned bodies are called \\"Meths\\" or \\"Methuselahs.\\" In 2016, it was announced that producer David Heyman would produce a biblical epic starring Tom Cruise as Methuselah with Joachim R√∏nning to direct. The film is set to show Methuselah as never aging and possessing \\"unparalleled survival skills.\\" The subgiant star HD 140283 is believed to be the oldest extant star discovered, often nicknamed \\"The Methuselah Star\\" after the ancient biblical figure.

Together with his wife and partner, Denise Scott Brown, he helped shape the way that architects, planners and students experience and think about architecture and the American-built environment. Their buildings, planning, theoretical writings, and teaching have also contributed to the expansion of discourse about architecture. Venturi was awarded the Pritzker Prize in Architecture in 1991; the prize was awarded to him alone, despite a request to include his equal partner, Brown. Subsequently, a group of women architects attempted to get her name added retroactively to the prize, but the Pritzker Prize jury declined to do so. Venturi is also known for having coined the maxim \\"Less is a bore\\", a postmodern antidote to Mies van der Rohe's famous modernist dictum \\"Less is more\\". Venturi lived in Philadelphia with Denise Scott Brown. He is the father of James Venturi, founder and principal of ReThink Studio. Early life and education Venturi was born in Philadelphia to Robert Venturi Sr. and Vanna (n√©e Luizi) Venturi and was raised as a Quaker.The Nassau Herald 1947, Princeton University yearbook Venturi attended school at the Episcopal Academy in Merion, Pennsylvania. in Introduction by Robert Venturi He graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1947 where he was a member-elect of Phi Beta Kappa and won the D'Amato Prize in Architecture. He received his M.F.A. from Princeton in 1950. The educational program at Princeton under Professor Jean Labatut, who offered provocative design studios within a Beaux-Arts pedagogical framework, was a key factor in Venturi's development of an approach to architectural theory and design that drew from architectural history and commercial architecture in analytical, as opposed to stylistic, terms.Robert Venturi 1991 Laureate Pritzker Architecture Prize In 1951 he briefly worked under Eero Saarinen in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and later for Louis Kahn in Philadelphia. He was awarded the Rome Prize Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome in 1954, where he studied and toured Europe for two years. From 1959 to 1967, Venturi held teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as Kahn's teaching assistant, an instructor, and later, as associate professor. It was there, in 1960, that he met fellow faculty member, architect and planner Denise Scott Brown. Venturi taught later at the Yale School of Architecture and was a visiting lecturer with Scott Brown in 2003 at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Architectural theories A controversial critic of the blithely functionalist and symbolically vacuous architecture of corporate modernism during the 1950s, Venturi was one of the first architects to question some of the premises of the Modern Movement. He published his \\"gentle manifesto\\", Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture in 1966; in its introduction, Vincent Scully called it \\"probably the most important writing on the making of architecture since Le Corbusier's Vers Une Architecture of 1923.\\" The work was derived from course lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and Venturi received a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1965 to aid in its completion. The book demonstrated, through countless examples, an approach to understanding architectural composition and complexity, and the resulting richness and interest. Citing vernacular as well as high-style sources, Venturi drew new lessons from the buildings of architects familiar (Michelangelo, Alvar Aalto) and then-forgotten (Frank Furness, Edwin Lutyens). He made a case for \\"the difficult whole\\" rather than the diagrammatic forms popular at the time, and included examples ‚Äî both built and unrealized ‚Äî of his own work to demonstrate the possible application of such techniques. The book has been published in 18 languages to date. Venturi's wife and business partner Denise Scott Brown Immediately hailed as a theorist and designer with radical ideas, Venturi went to teach a series of studios at the Yale School of Architecture in the mid-1960s. The most famous of these was a studio in 1968 in which Venturi and Scott Brown, together with Steven Izenour, led a team of students to document and analyze the Las Vegas Strip, perhaps the least likely subject for a serious research project imaginable. In 1972, Venturi, Scott Brown and Izenour published the folio, A Significance for A&P; Parking Lots, or Learning from Las Vegas. It was revised using the student work as a foil for new theory, and reissued in 1977 as Learning from Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form. This second manifesto was an even more stinging rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes. The book coined the terms \\"Duck\\" and \\"Decorated Shed,\\" descriptions of the two predominant ways of embodying iconography in buildings. The work of Venturi, Scott Brown, and John Rauch adopted the latter strategy, producing formally simple \\"decorated sheds\\" with rich, complex, and often shocking ornamental flourishes. Venturi and his wife co-wrote several more books at the end of the century, but these two have so far proved to be the most influential. Architecture Guild House, completed 1964, on Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia The architecture of Robert Venturi, although perhaps not as familiar today as his books, helped redirect American architecture away from a widely practiced, often banal, modernism in the 1960s to a more exploratory design approach that openly drew lessons from architectural history and responded to the everyday context of the American city. Venturi's buildings typically juxtapose architectural systems, elements and aims, to acknowledge the conflicts often inherent in a project or site. This \\"inclusive\\" approach contrasted with the typical modernist effort to resolve and unify all factors in a complete and rigidly structured‚Äîand possibly less functional and more simplistic‚Äîwork of art. The diverse range of buildings of Venturi's early career offered surprising alternatives to then current architectural practice, with \\"impure\\" forms (such as the North Penn Visiting Nurses Headquarters), apparently casual asymmetries (as at the Vanna Venturi House), and pop-style supergraphics and geometries (for instance, the Lieb House). Chapel at the Episcopal Academy, Newtown Square, PA. (2010) Venturi created the firm Venturi and Short with William Short in 1960. In his architectural design Venturi was influenced by early masters such as Michelangelo and Palladio, and modern masters including Le Corbusier, Alvar Aalto, Louis Kahn and Eero Saarinen. After John Rauch replaced Short as partner in 1964, the firm's name changed to Venturi and Rauch. Venturi married Denise Scott Brown on July 23, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, and in 1969, Scott Brown joined the firm as partner in charge of planning. In 1980, The firm's name became Venturi, Rauch, and Scott Brown, and after Rauch's resignation in 1989, Venturi, Scott Brown, and Associates. The firm, based in Manayunk, Philadelphia, was awarded the Architecture Firm Award by the American Institute of Architects in 1985. The practice's recent work includes many commissions from academic institutions, including campus planning and university buildings, and civic buildings in London, Toulouse, and Japan. Venturi's architecture has had worldwide influence, beginning in the late 1960s with the dissemination of the broken-gable roof of the Vanna Venturi House and the segmentally arched window and interrupted string courses of Guild House. The playful variations on vernacular house types seen in the Trubeck and Wislocki Houses offered a new way to embrace, but transform, familiar forms. The facade patterning of the Oberlin Art Museum and the laboratory buildings demonstrated a treatment of the vertical surfaces of buildings that is both decorative and abstract, drawing from vernacular and historic architecture while still being modern. Venturi's work arguably provided a key influence at important times in the careers of architects Robert A. M. Stern, Rem Koolhaas, Philip Johnson, Michael Graves, Graham Gund and James Stirling, among others. Venturi was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects, The American Academy of Arts and Letters and an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Death Venturi died on September 18, 2018, in Philadelphia from complications of Alzheimer's disease.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/obituaries/robert-venturi-dead.html He was 93. In the wake of Venturi's death, Michael Kimmelman, the current architecture critic for the New York Times, tweeted...\\"RIP the great, inspiring Robert Venturi who opened millions of eyes and whole new ways of thinking about the richness of our architectural environment, and whose diverse work with Denise Scott Brown contains a mix of wit and humanity that continues to transcend labels and time\\".https://twitter.com/kimmelman/status/1042496869564395521 Notable students Venturi's notable students include Amy Weinstein and Peter Corrigan.

The alcid family includes the murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and murrelets. The word auk is derived from Icelandic √°lka, from Old Norse alka (‚Äúauk‚Äù), from Proto-Germanic *alk«≠ (‚Äúsea-bird, auk‚Äù). Apart from the extinct great auk, all auks can \\"fly\\" under water as well as in the air. Although they are excellent swimmers and divers, their walking appears clumsy. Several species have different common names in Europe and North America. The guillemots of Europe are referred to as murres in North America, if they occur in both continents, and the little auk is referred to as the dovekie. Description Auks are superficially similar to penguins having black-and- white colours, upright posture and some of their habits. Nevertheless, they are not closely related to penguins, but rather are believed to be an example of moderate convergent evolution. Auks are monomorphic (males and females are similar in appearance). Extant auks range in size from the least auklet, at 85 g (3 oz) and , to the thick-billed murre, at and . Due to their short wings, auks have to flap their wings very quickly in order to fly. Although not to the extent of penguins, auks have largely sacrificed flight, and also mobility on land, in exchange for swimming ability; their wings are a compromise between the best possible design for diving and the bare minimum needed for flying. This varies by subfamily, the Uria guillemots (including the razorbill) and murrelets being the most efficient under the water, whereas the puffins and auklets are better adapted for flying and walking. Feeding and ecology The feeding behaviour of auks is often compared to that of penguins; both groups are wing-propelled pursuit divers. In the region where auks live, their only seabird competition are cormorants (which are dive-powered by their strong feet). In areas where the two groups feed on the same prey, the auks tend to feed further offshore. Strong-swimming murres hunt faster schooling fish, whereas auklets take slower-moving krill. Time depth recorders on auks have shown that they can dive as deep as 100 m in the case of Uria guillemots, 40 m for the Cepphus guillemots and 30 m for the auklets. Breeding and colonies Auks are pelagic birds, spending the majority of their adult life on the open sea and going ashore only for breeding, although some species ‚Äî like the common guillemot ‚Äî spend a great part of the year defending their nesting spot from others. Auks are monogamous, and tend to form lifelong pairs. They typically lay a single egg, and they are philopatric (they use the nesting site year after year). Some species, such as the Uria guillemots (murres), nest in large colonies on cliff edges; others, like the Cepphus guillemots, breed in small groups on rocky coasts; and the puffins, auklets, and some murrelets nest in burrows. All species except the Brachyramphus murrelets are colonial. Evolution and distribution Auks as painted by Archibald Thorburn Traditionally, the auks were believed to be one of the earliest distinct charadriiform lineages due to their characteristic morphology. However, genetic analyses have demonstrated that these peculiarities are the product of strong natural selection instead: as opposed to, for example, plovers (a much older charadriiform lineage), auks radically changed from a wading shorebird to a diving seabird lifestyle. Thus, today, the auks are no longer separated in their own suborder (\\"Alcae\\"), but are considered part of the Lari suborder which otherwise contains gulls and similar birds. Judging from genetic data, their closest living relatives appear to be the skuas, with these two lineages separating about 30 million years ago (mya). Alternatively, auks may have split off far earlier from the rest of the Lari and undergone strong morphological, but slow genetic evolution, which would require a very high evolutionary pressure, coupled with a long lifespan and slow reproduction. The earliest unequivocal fossils of auks are from the late Eocene, some 35 mya. The genus Miocepphus, (from the Miocene, 15 mya) is the earliest known from good specimens. Two very fragmentary fossils are often assigned to the Alcidae, although this may not be correct: Hydrotherikornis (late Eocene) and Petralca (Late Oligocene). Most extant genera are known to exist since the Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (c. 5 mya). Miocene fossils have been found in both California and Maryland, but the greater diversity of fossils and tribes in the Pacific leads most scientists to conclude that it was there they first evolved, and it is in the Miocene Pacific that the first fossils of extant genera are found. Early movement between the Pacific and the Atlantic probably happened to the south (since there was no northern opening to the Atlantic), later movements across the Arctic Ocean. The flightless subfamily Mancallinae, which was apparently restricted to the Pacific coast of southern North America and became extinct in the Early Pleistocene, is sometimes includes in the family Alcidae under some definitions. One species, Miomancalla howardae, is the largest charadriiform of all time. Razorbills are true auks only found in the Atlantic Ocean The extant auks (subfamily Alcinae) are broken up into 2 main groups: the usually high-billed puffins (tribe Fraterculini) and auklets (tribe Aethiini), as opposed to the more slender-billed murres and true auks (tribe Alcini), and the murrelets and guillemots (tribes Brachyramphini and Cepphini). The tribal arrangement was originally based on analyses of morphology and ecology. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence and allozyme studies confirm these findings except that the Synthliboramphus murrelets should be split into a distinct tribe, as they appear more closely related to the Alcini ‚Äì in any case, assumption of a closer relationship between the former and the true guillemots was only weakly supported by earlier studies. Of the genera there are only a few species in each. This is probably a product of the rather small geographic range of the family (the most limited of any seabird family), and the periods of glacial advance and retreat that have kept the populations on the move in a narrow band of subarctic ocean. Today, as in the past, the auks are restricted to cooler northern waters. Their ability to spread further south is restricted as their prey hunting method, pursuit diving, becomes less efficient in warmer waters. The speed at which small fish (which along with krill are the auk's principal food items) can swim doubles as the temperature increases from , with no corresponding increase in speed for the bird. The southernmost auks, in California and Mexico, can survive there because of cold upwellings. The current paucity of auks in the Atlantic (6 species), compared to the Pacific (19‚Äì20 species) is considered to be because of extinctions to the Atlantic auks; the fossil record shows there were many more species in the Atlantic during the Pliocene. Auks also tend to be restricted to continental shelf waters and breed on few oceanic islands. Hydotherikornis oregonus (Described by Miller in 1931), the oldest purported alcid from the Eocene of California, is actually a petrel (as reviewed by Chandler in 1990) and is reassigned to the tubenoses (Procellariiformes). A 2003 paper entitled \\"The Earliest North American Record of Auk (Aves: Alcidae) From the Late Eocene of Central Georgia\\" by Robert M. Chandler and Dennis Parmley of Georgia College and State University reports a Late Eocene, wing-propelled diving, auk from the Priabonain Stage of the Late Eocene. These sediments have been dated through Chandronian NALMA {North American Land Mammal Age}, at an estimate of 34.5 to 35.5 million years on the Eocene time scale for fossil bearing sediments of the Clinchfield Formation, Gordon, Wilkinson County, Georgia. Furthermore, the sediments containing this unabraded portion of a left humerus (43.7 mm long) are tropical or sub-tropical as evidenced by a wealth of warm water shark teeth, palaeophied snake vertebrae and turtles.

He coined the concept of 'arcology' ‚Äì a synthesis of architecture and ecology as the philosophy of democratic society. He died at home of natural causes on 9 April 2013 at the age of 93. Soleri authored several books, including The Bridge Between Matter & Spirit is Matter Becoming Spirit and Arcology - City In the Image of Man. Early life Soleri was born in Turin, Italy, Europe. He was awarded his \\"laurea\\" (master's degree) in architecture from the Politecnico di Torino in 1946. He visited the United States in December 1946 and spent a year and a half in fellowship with Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona, and at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wisconsin. During this time, he gained international recognition for a bridge design that was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1950, Soleri, with his wife Colly (n√©e Corolyn Woods), returned to Italy where he was commissioned to build a large ceramics factory, Ceramica Artistica Solimene, in Vietri on the Amalfi coast. Soleri adapted ceramics industry processes learned at this time to use in his award-winning designs and production of ceramic and bronze windbells and silt-cast architectural structures. For more than 40 years, proceeds from sales of the wind-bells have been an important source of funds for construction that is meant to test his theoretical work. Ceramic and bronze bells continue to be produced and sold at Arcosanti and Cosanti in Arizona. In 1956, Soleri settled in Scottsdale, Arizona, with Colly and the elder of their two daughters; the younger was born in Arizona. He began building Arcosanti in 1970 with the help of architecture and design students, as a place to test his urban design hypotheses. This \\"urban laboratory\\" (so-dubbed by Ada Louise Huxtable, who at the time was the architectural critic of The NY Times) became internationally renowned. Paolo and Colly Soleri made a lifelong commitment to research and experimentation in urban planning. They established the Cosanti Foundation, a 501-3C educational non-profit foundation. Soleri's philosophy and works were strongly influenced by the Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Soleri died on 9 April 2013 and was buried at Arcosanti in its private cemetery, beside his wife. Arcosanti The Cosanti Foundation's major project is Arcosanti. Arcosanti, as originally designed by Soleri, was intended for 5,000 people; it has been in construction since 1970. Located near Cordes Junction, about north of Phoenix and visible from Interstate I-17 in central Arizona, the intention of the project is to provide a model that can demonstrate Soleri's concept of \\"Arcology\\", architecture coherent with ecology. Arcology was envisioned by Soleri as a hyper-dense city, designed to: maximize human interaction with ready access to shared, cost-effective infrastructural services; conserve water and reduce sewage; minimize the use of energy, raw materials and land; reduce waste and environmental pollution; increase interaction with the surrounding natural environment. In 2010, construction was underway to complete Arcosanti's Greenhouse Apron, but that initiative was put on hold not long after Soleri's death in 2013. Arcosanti is intended as a prototype of a desert arcology. Soleri's other arcology designs envisioned sites such as the ocean (Nova Noah), et al. (see: Arcology: City in the Image of Man). Since 1970, over 7000 people have participated in Arcosanti's construction. Their international affiliation group is called the Arcosanti Alumni Network.Arcosanti Alumni Network. Retrieved from https://arcosanti.org/node/30. Other achievements The International Architecture Symposium \\"Mensch und Raum\\" (Man and Space) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1984 received international attention. Paolo Soleri participated with, among others: Justus Dahinden, Dennis Sharp, Bruno Zevi, Jorge Glusberg, Otto Kapfinger, Frei Otto, Pierre Vago, Ernst Gisel, and Ionel Schein. Soleri was a distinguished lecturer in the College of Architecture at Arizona State University and a member of the Lindisfarne Association. In 1966, Paolo Soleri began working on the design for the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was built for the IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts) on what is now the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School using large silt cast forms. The property is owned by the nineteen Native American Pueblos of New Mexico and is therefore not protected by local or state preservation laws. A landmark exhibition, \\"City in the Image of Man - The Architectural Visions of Paolo Soleri\\", organized in 1970 by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, traveled extensively thereafter in the U.S. and Canada, breaking records for attendance. \\"Two Suns Arcology, A Concept for Future Cities\\" opened in 1976 at the Xerox Square Center in Rochester, New York. In 1989, \\"Paolo Soleri Habitats: Ecologic Minutiae\\", an exhibition of arcologies, space habitats, and bridges, was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. More recently, \\"Soleri's Cities, Architecture for the Planet Earth and Beyond\\" was featured at the Scottsdale Center for the Arts in Scottsdale, AZ. A Soleri bell appears in the film What the *Bleep* Do We Know? His work has been exhibited worldwide. In 1976, Paolo Soleri was a key participant at UN Habitat I, the first UN forum on human settlements, held it Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, North America. Soleri appeared there together with Buckminster Fuller. The Paolo Soleri Archives, the collection of Soleri's drawings and writings, is located at Arcosanti. The Soleri Archives is managed by Sue Kirsch under the direction of Tomiaki Tamura, a Cosanti Board Trustee and Arcosanti's Director of Special Projects. Tomiaki Tamura resides at Arcosanti. An interview with Soleri was featured in the environmental documentary The 11th Hour (2007). On 10 December 2010, the Soleri Bridge and Plaza was completed.Soleri Bridge and Plaza. Retrieved from scottsdalepublicart.org The structure had been commissioned by Scottsdale Public Art. The pedestrian bridge based on Paolo Soleri's design is located on the South Bank of the Arizona Canal and connects a developed retail area of the Scottsdale Waterfront with Old Town Scottsdale. The bridge is incorporated into a plaza including silt cast artwork, as well as a large bell assembly called The Goldwater Bell, also designed by Paolo Soleri. The feature-length documentary film The Vision Of Paolo Soleri: Prophet In The Desert (2013) contains interviews with Morley Safer, Paul Goldberger, Catherine Hardwicke, Will Bruder, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Steven Holl, and Eric Lloyd Wright. Awards Soleri received fellowships from the Graham Foundation and from the Guggenheim Foundation (1964, Architecture, Planning, & Design). He was awarded three honorary doctorates and several awards from design groups worldwide: * 1963 ‚Äì American Institute of Architects Gold Medal for Craftmanship * 1981 ‚Äì Gold Medal at the World Bienniale of Architecture held by the International Academy of Architecture in Sofia, Bulgaria * 1984 ‚Äì Silver Medal of the Academie d' Architecture in Paris * 1996 ‚Äì Honorary Fellow, Royal Institute of British Architects * 2000 ‚Äì Leone d'oro at the Venice Biennale of Architecture for his lifelong achievement * 2006 ‚Äì Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for lifetime achievement  Sexual abuse allegation  In October 2010, Daniela Soleri - Paolo Soleri's daughter - resigned from the Cosanti Foundation board, citing abuse by her father. She stated that some of Soleri‚Äôs inner circle had been told decades earlier, but nothing had been done about it at the time. After the resignation, Soleri stepped down as chairman, but the board made no public statement on the reasons. After the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art had a major retrospective exhibition on Paolo Soleri in October 2017, Daniela published an article on the website Medium on 13 November 2017 accusing her father of persistent sexual abuse, writing: > \\"In my early adolescence, my father, an architect and craftsman, began > sexually molesting me, eventually attempting rape when I was 17.\\" Encouraged to publish the article by the #MeToo movement, Daniela wrote that she had already come forward to many of her father's colleagues but received little response: In the article, Daniela wrote about her lingering admiration for some of Soleri's work and ideas. However, she also warned against uncritical praise of artists with abusive tendencies and the tendency to \\"accept abusive behavior as a necessary and justified cost for the contributions of intellect or creativity\\". Of her father, Daniela wrote: As noted in Dezeen, Daniela's article suggested that she had approached The New York Times or other news publishers to discuss her father's abuse, but had been turned away. The Cosanti Foundation Board released an official statement in response to Daniela Soleri's: Curbed editor-in-chief Kelsey Keith wrote \\"[Daniela] Soleri's account is breathtaking not only for its thorough and very personal reckoning with the truth, but for its clear-eyed articulation of the reasons why assigning all intellectual power to a solitary genius is so harmful.\\" Keith noted that architecture as a profession \\"hasn't (yet) experienced its Weinstein moment\\", referring to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the resulting \\"Weinstein effect\\" of reporting sexual misconduct committed by powerful men in media and other industries. In a 2018 Curbed article, Hilary George-Parkin said: > \\"While Hollywood, tech, sports, media, politics, the restaurant industry, > and others are reeling from high-profile revelations and resignations, the > design world has remained‚Äîwith the notable exception of Daniela Soleri's > account of sexual abuse by her father, architect Paolo Soleri‚Äîmostly > undisturbed in the public realm.\\" See also * Arcosanti * Buckminster Fuller * Jacque Fresco References Notes Bibliography *S.

In 1961, Safdie received his master's degree in Architecture from the McGill University School of Architecture.  Career  After apprenticing with Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, Safdie returned to Montreal to oversee the master plan for Expo 67. In 1964, he established his own firm to undertake Habitat 67, an adaptation of his McGill thesis. Habitat 67, which pioneered the design and implementation of three-dimensional, prefabricated units for living, was a central feature of Expo 67 and an important development in architectural history. He was awarded the 1967 Construction Man of the Year Award from the Engineering News Record and the Massey Medal for Architecture in Canada for Habitat 67. Habitat 67 In 1970, Safdie opened a branch office in Jerusalem. Among the projects he has designed in Jerusalem are Yad Vashem and the Alrov Mamilla Quarter, which includes the Mamilla Mall, David's Village luxury condominiums, and the 5-star Mamilla Hotel. In 1978, after teaching at McGill, Ben Gurion, and Yale universities, Safdie moved his main office to Boston and became director of the Urban Design Program at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, until 1984. From 1984 to 1989, he was the Ian Woodner Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at Harvard. Since the early-1990s, Safdie, a citizen of Canada, Israel, and the United States, has focused on his architectural practice, Safdie Architects, which is based in Somerville, Massachusetts, and has branches in Toronto, Jerusalem, and Singapore. Safdie has designed six of Canada's principal public institutions‚Äîincluding the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and Vancouver Library Square‚Äîas well as many other notable projects around the world, including the Salt Lake City Main Public Library; the Khalsa Heritage Centre in Punjab, India; the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort in Singapore; the United States Institute of Peace Headquarters in Washington, DC; the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri; and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas; as well as his latest achievement Jewel Changi Airport in Singapore. Style Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Raffles City, Chongqing, China Moshe Safdie's works are known for their dramatic curves, arrays of geometric patterns, use of windows, and key placement of open and green spaces. His writings and designs stress the need to create meaningful, vital, and inclusive spaces that enhance community, with special attention to the essence of a particular locale, geography, and culture. He is a self-described modernist.

After working in various capacities for several firms in Philadelphia, he founded his own atelier in 1935. While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and professor of architecture at Yale School of Architecture from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. Kahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. Famous for his meticulously built works, his provocative proposals that remained unbuilt, and his teaching, Kahn was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century. He was awarded the AIA Gold Medal and the RIBA Gold Medal. At the time of his death he was considered by some as \\"America's foremost living architect.\\" Biography =Early life= Jesse Oser House, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania (1940) Louis Kahn, whose original name was Itze-Leib (Leiser- Itze) Schmuilowsky (Schmalowski), was born into a poor Jewish family in P√§rnu,Kahn biography formerly in the Russian Empire, but now in Estonia. He spent his early childhood in Kuressaare on the island of Saaremaa, then part of the Russian Empire's Livonian Governorate. At the age of three, he saw coals in the stove and was captivated by the light of the coal. He put the coal in his apron, which caught on fire and burned his face. He carried these scars for the rest of his life.Commstock, Paul. \\"An Interview with Louis Kahn Biographer Carter Wiseman,\\" California Literary Review. June 15, 2007. In 1906, his family emigrated to the United States, as they feared that his father would be recalled into the military during the Russo-Japanese War. His birth year may have been inaccurately recorded in the process of immigration. According to his son's 2003 documentary film, the family could not afford pencils. They made their own charcoal sticks from burnt twigs so that Louis could earn a little money from drawings.My Architect: A Son's Journey , SBS Hot Docs, 15 January 2008 Later he earned money by playing piano to accompany silent movies in theaters. He became a naturalized citizen on May 15, 1914. His father changed their name to Kahn in 1915. =Education= Kahn excelled in art from a young age, repeatedly winning the annual award for the best watercolor by a Philadelphia high school student. He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at Philadelphia Central High School until he took a course in architecture in his senior year, which convinced him to become an architect. He turned down an offer to go to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to study art under a full scholarship, instead working at a variety of jobs to pay his own tuition for a degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts. There, he studied under Paul Philippe Cret in a version of the Beaux-Arts tradition, one that discouraged excessive ornamentation. =Career= After completing his Bachelor of Architecture in 1924, Kahn worked as senior draftsman in the office of the city architect, John Molitor. He worked on the designs for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition.\\"Louis Isadore Kahn (1901‚Äì1974)\\", Philadelphia Architects and Buildings In 1928, Kahn made a European tour. He was interested particularly in the medieval walled city of Carcassonne, France, and the castles of Scotland, rather than any of the strongholds of classicism or modernism.Johnson, Eugene J. \\"A Drawing of the Cathedral of Albi by Louis I. Kahn,\\" Gesta, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 159‚Äì165. After returning to the United States in 1929, Kahn worked in the offices of Paul Philippe Cret, his former studio critic at the University of Pennsylvania, and then with Zantzinger, Borie and Medary in Philadelphia. In 1932, Kahn and Dominique Berninger founded the Architectural Research Group, whose members were interested in the populist social agenda and new aesthetics of the European avant-gardes. Among the projects Kahn worked on during this collaboration are schemes for public housing that he had presented to the Public Works Administration, which supported some similar projects during the Great Depression. They remained unbuilt. Louis Kahn's Salk Institute Among the more important of Kahn's early collaborations was one with George Howe.Howe, George (1886‚Äì1955), Philadelphia Architects and Buildings Kahn worked with Howe in the late 1930s on projects for the Philadelphia Housing Authority and again in 1940, along with German- born architect Oscar Stonorov, for the design of housing developments in other parts of Pennsylvania.Stonorov, Oskar Gregory (1905‚Äì1970), Philadelphia Architects and Buildings] A formal architectural office partnership between Kahn and Oscar Stonorov began in February 1942 and ended in March 1947, which produced fifty-four documented projects and buildings. Kahn did not arrive at his distinctive architectural style until he was in his fifties. Initially working in a fairly orthodox version of the International Style, he was influenced vitally by a stay as Architect in Residence at the American Academy in Rome during 1950, which marked a turning point in his career. After visiting the ruins of ancient buildings in Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he adopted a back-to-the-basics approach. He developed his own style as influenced by earlier modern movements, but not limited by their sometimes- dogmatic ideologies. In the 1950s and 1960s as a consultant architect for the Philadelphia City Planning Commission Kahn developed several plans for the center of Philadelphia that were never executed. In 1961 he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts to study traffic movement in Philadelphia and to create a proposal for a viaduct system.Philadelphia City Planning: Market Street East Project Page MoMA.org The Collection Louis I. Kahn. Traffic Study, project, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Plan of proposed traffic-movement pattern. 1952 He described this proposal at a lecture given in 1962 at the International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado: > In the center of town the streets should become buildings. This should be > interplayed with a sense of movement which does not tax local streets for > non-local traffic. There should be a system of viaducts which encase an area > which can reclaim the local streets for their own use, and it should be made > so this viaduct has a ground floor of shops and usable area. A model which I > did for the Graham Foundation recently, and which I presented to Mr. > Entenza, showed the scheme. Kahn's teaching career began at Yale University in 1947. He eventually was named as the Albert F. Bemis Professor of Architecture and Planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. Kahn then returned to Philadelphia to teach at the University of Pennsylvania from 1957 until his death, becoming the Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture. He also was a visiting lecturer at Princeton University School of Architecture from 1961 to 1967. Awards and honors Kahn was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1953. He was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1964. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1964. In 1965 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician. He was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and awarded the AIA Gold Medal, the highest award given by the AIA, in 1971, and the Royal Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in 1972. In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Death In 1974, Kahn died of a heart attack in a restroom at Penn Station in Manhattan. He had just returned from a work trip to India. Owing to police miscommunications in both New York City and Philadelphia, his wife and his office were not notified until two days after his death. After his long career, he was in debt when he died. Louis Kahn - A pencil sketch by Sarbjit Bahga Personal life Kahn had three children with three women. With his wife, Esther (1905-1996), whom he married in 1930, he had a daughter, Sue Ann. With Anne Tyng, who began her working collaboration and personal relationship with Kahn in 1945, he also had a daughter, Alexandra. When Tyng became pregnant in 1953, to mitigate the scandal, she went to Rome, Italy, for the birth of their daughter. With Harriet Pattison, he had a son, Nathaniel Kahn. Most biographical works on Kahn fail to describe the profound impact his female partners had on his designs. Anne Tyng was an extremely talented architect and teacher, while Harriet Pattison was a pioneering landscape architect. Legacy Kahn's obituary in the New York Times written by Paul Goldberger mentions only Esther and his daughter by her as survivors. All of his children and their mothers attended the funeral. In 2003 Nathaniel Kahn released a documentary about his father, entitled, My Architect: A Son's Journey. The Oscar-nominated film provides views and insights into the architecture of Kahn while exploring him personally through people who knew him: family, friends, and colleagues. It includes interviews with such renowned architectural contemporaries as Shamshul Wares, B. V. Doshi, Frank Gehry, Ed Bacon, Philip Johnson, I. M. Pei, Vincent J. Scully, and Robert A. M. Stern. It also provides insights into Kahn's unusual and complicated family arrangements.

For example, he designed a hollow concrete tetrahedral space-frame that did away with the need for ductwork and reduced the floor-to-floor height by channeling air through the structure itself. Like many of Kahn's buildings, the Art Gallery makes subtle references to its context while overtly rejecting any historical style. * Richards Medical Research Laboratories, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1957‚Äì1965), a breakthrough in Kahn's career that helped set new directions for modern architecture with its clear expression of served and servant spaces and its evocation of the architecture of the past. * The Salk Institute, La Jolla, California (1959‚Äì1965) was to be a campus composed of three main clusters: meeting and conference areas, living quarters, and laboratories. Only the laboratory cluster, consisting of two parallel blocks enclosing a water garden, was built. The two laboratory blocks frame a long view of the Pacific Ocean, accentuated by a thin linear fountain that seems to reach for the horizon. It has been named \\"arguably the defining work\\" of Kahn. * First Unitarian Church, Rochester, New York (1959‚Äì1969), named as one of the greatest religious structures of the twentieth century by Paul Goldberger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic.

Kahn got the design contract with the help of Muzharul Islam, one of his students at Yale University, who worked with him on the project. The Bangladeshi Parliament building is the centerpiece of the national capital complex designed by Kahn, which includes hostels, dining halls, and a hospital.

His few projects reflect his deep personal involvement with each. Isamu Noguchi called him \\"a philosopher among architects.\\" He was known for his ability to create monumental architecture that responded to the human scale. He also was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between served spaces and servant spaces. What he meant by servant spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms. His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble. He is often well remembered for his deliberation about the use of brick, on how it can be more than the basic building material: > If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, 'What do you want, Brick?' And > Brick says to you, 'I like an Arch.' And if you say to Brick, 'Look, arches > are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think > of that, Brick?' Brick says, 'I like an Arch.' And it's important, you see, > that you honor the material that you use. ... You can only do it if you > honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it. While widely known for the poetic sensibilities of his spaces, Kahn also worked closely with engineers and contractors on his buildings. The results often were technically innovative and highly refined. In addition to the influence Kahn's more well-known work has on contemporary architects (such as Muzharul Islam, Tadao Ando), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the high-tech architects of the late twentieth century (such as Renzo Piano, who worked in Kahn's office, Richard Rogers, and Norman Foster). His prominent apprentices include Muzharul Islam, Moshe Safdie, Robert Venturi, Jack Diamond, and Charles Dagit. Many years after his death, Kahn continues to provoke controversy. Before his Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park at the southern tip of Roosevelt Island was built, a New York Times editorial opined: > There's a magic to the project. That the task is daunting makes it worthy of > the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New > Deal and a world war. As for Mr. Kahn, he died in 1974, as he passed alone > through New York City's Penn Station. In his briefcase were renderings of > the memorial, his last completed plan. The editorial describes Kahn's plan as: > ... simple and elegant. Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt's defense of the > Four Freedoms‚Äîof speech and religion, and from want and fear‚Äîhe designed an > open 'room and a garden' at the bottom of the island. Trees on either side > form a 'V' defining a green space, and leading to a two-walled stone room at > the water's edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline. A group spearheaded by William J. vanden Heuvel raised over $50 million in public and private funds between 2005 and 2012 to establish the memorial. Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park officially opened to the public on October 24, 2012. In popular culture Kahn was the subject of the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary film My Architect: A Son's Journey, presented by Nathaniel Kahn, his son. Kahn's complicated family life inspired the \\"Undaunted Mettle\\" episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent. In the 1993 film Indecent Proposal, character David Murphy (played by Woody Harrelson), referenced Kahn during a lecture to architecture students, attributing the quote \\"Even a brick wants to be something\\" to Kahn. Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Lewis Spratlan, with collaborators Jenny Kallick and John Downey (Amherst College, class of 2003), composed the chamber opera Architect as a character study of Kahn. The premiere recording was due to be released in 2012 by Navona Records. In Showtime's Billions (Season 4, Episode 6), Taylor Mason and Wendy Rhoades meet at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park and discussed Kahn's genius and his relationship with his estranged son.

The Oxford Companion to the English Language, p. 612. Oxford University Press. \\"Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature\\", pp. 97‚Äì98 University of Nebraska Press. Extended Ancient Greek texts avoiding the letter sigma are the earliest examples of lipograms.Motte Jr, Warren F (1986). \\"Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature\\", pp. 100‚Äì101 University of Nebraska Press. Writing a lipogram may be a trivial task when avoiding uncommon letters like Z, J, Q, or X, but it is much more challenging to avoid common letters like E, T, or A in the English language, as the author must omit many ordinary words. Grammatically meaningful and smooth-flowing lipograms can be difficult to compose. Identifying lipograms can also be problematic, as there is always the possibility that a given piece of writing in any language may be unintentionally lipogrammatic. For example, Poe's poem The Raven contains no Z, but there is no evidence that this was intentional. A pangrammatic lipogram is a text that uses every letter of the alphabet except one. For example, \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\\" omits the letter S, which the usual pangram includes by using the word jumps. History Lasus of Hermione, who lived during the second half of the sixth century BCE, is the most ancient author of a lipogram. This makes the lipogram, according to Quintus Curtius Rufus, \\"the most ancient systematic artifice of Western literature\\".Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature. p. 100 University of Nebraska Press. Lasus did not like the sigma, and excluded it from one of his poems, entitled Ode to the Centaurs, of which nothing remains; as well as a Hymn to Demeter, of which the first verse remains: : ŒîŒ¨ŒºŒ±œÑœÅŒ± ŒºŒ≠ŒªœÄœâ ŒöœåœÅŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒµ ŒöŒªœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒπ·æΩ ·ºÑŒªŒøœáŒøŒΩ : ŒºŒµŒªŒπŒ≤œåŒ±ŒΩ ·ΩïŒºŒΩŒøŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩŒ≠œâŒΩ : Œë·º∞ŒøŒªŒØŒ¥·æΩ ·ºÇŒº Œ≤Œ±œÅœçŒ≤œÅŒøŒºŒøŒΩ ·ºÅœÅŒºŒøŒΩŒØŒ±ŒΩ : D√°matra m√©lp√¥ K√≥ran te Klym√©noi·æΩ √°lochon : melib√≥an h√Ωmnon anagn√©√¥n : Aiol√≠d·æΩ √°m bar√Ωbromon armon√≠an This translates to: :I chant of Demeter and Kore, Wife of the famed [Pluto] :Lifting forth a gentle-voiced hymn :In the deep-toned Aeolian mode.Athen., 14.624e‚Äìf, and see 10.455c‚Äìd The late antiquity Greek poets Nestor of Laranda and Tryphiodorus wrote lipogrammatic adaptations of the Homeric poems: Nestor composed an Iliad, which was followed by Tryphiodorus' Odyssey. Both Nestor's Iliad and Tryphiodorus' Odyssey were composed of 24 books (like the original Iliad and Odyssey) each book omitting a subsequent letter of the Greek alphabet. Therefore, the first book omitted alpha, the second beta, and so forth. Twelve centuries after Tryphiodorus wrote his lipogrammatic Odyssey, in 1711, the influential London essayist and journalist Joseph Addison commented on this work (although it had been lost), arguing that \\"it must have been amusing to see the most elegant word of the language rejected like \\"a diamond with a flaw in it\\" if it was tainted by the proscribed letter\\".\\"Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature\\", p. 101. University of Nebraska Press. Petrus Riga, a canon of Sainte-Marie de Reims during the 11th century, translated the Bible, and due to its scriptural obscurities called it Aurora. Each canto of the translation was followed by a resume in Lipogrammatic verse; the first canto has no A, the second has no B, and so on. There are two hundred and fifty manuscripts of Petrus Riga's Bible still preserved.Jacques Bens, Claude Berge, and Paul Braffort, History of the Lipogram, pp. 101, 102 There is a tradition of German and Italian lipograms excluding the letter R dating from the seventeenth century until modern times. While some authors excluded other letters, it was the exclusion of the R which ensured the practice of the lipogram continued into modern times. In German especially, the R, while not the most prevalent letter, has a very important grammatical role, as masculine pronouns etc in the nominative case include an R (e.g. er, der, dieser, jener, welcher).\\"Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature\\", p. 102 University of Nebraska Press. For the Italian authors, it seems to be a profound dislike of the letter R which prompted them to write lipograms excluding this letter (and often only this letter).\\"Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature\\", p. 103 University of Nebraska Press. There is also a long tradition of vocalic lipograms, in which a vowel (or vowels) is omitted. This tends to be the most difficult form of the lipogram. This practice was developed mainly in Spain by the Portuguese author Alonso de Alcala y Herrera who published an octavo entitled Varios efectos de amor, en cinco novelas exemplares, y nuevo artificio para escribir prosa y versos sin una de las letras vocales. From Spain, the method moved into FranceSee, for example Jacques Arago's Curieux voyage autour du monde(1853), omitting A. and England. One of the most remarkable examples of a lipogram is Ernest Vincent Wright's novel Gadsby (1939), which has over 50,000 words but not a single letter E. Wright's self- imposed rule prohibited such common English words as the and he, plurals ending in -es, past tenses ending in -ed, and even abbreviations like Mr. (since it is short for Mister) or Rob (for Robert). Yet the narration flows fairly smoothly, and the book was praised by critics for its literary merits. Wright was motivated to write Gadsby by an earlier four-stanza lipogrammatic poem of another author. Even earlier, Spanish playwright Enrique Jardiel Poncela published five short stories between 1926 and 1927, each one omitting a vowel; the best known are \\"El Chofer Nuevo\\" (\\"The new Driver\\"), without the letter A, and \\"Un marido sin vocaci√≥n\\" (\\"A Vocationless Husband\\"), without the E. Interest in lipograms was rekindled by Georges Perec's novel La Disparition (1969) (openly inspired by Wright's Gadsby) and its English translation A Void by Gilbert Adair. Both works are missing the letter E, which is the most common letter in French as well as in English. A Spanish translation instead omits the letter A, the second most common letter in that language. Perec subsequently wrote Les revenentes (1972), a novel that uses no vowels except for E. Perec was a member of Oulipo, a group of French authors who adopted a variety of constraints in their work. La Disparition is, to date, the longest lipogram in existence. Analysing lipograms Lipograms are sometimes dismissed by academia. \\"Literary history seems deliberately to ignore writing as practice, as work, as play\\".Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature, p. 98, University of Nebraska Press. In his book Rethinking Writing, Roy Harris notes that without the ability to analyse language, the lipogram would be unable to exist. He argues that \\"the lipogram would be inconceivable unless there were writing systems based on fixed inventories of graphic units, and unless it were possible to classify written texts on the base of the presence or absence of one of those units irrespective of any phonetic value it might have or any function in the script. He then continues on to argue that as the Greeks were able to invent this system of writing as they had a concept of literary notation. Harris then argues that the proof of this knowledge is found in the Greek invention of \\"a literate game which consists, essentially, in superimposing the structure of a notation on the structure of texts\\".\\"Rethinking Writing\\", pp. 113‚Äì114, Continuum. Pangrammatic lipogram A pangrammatic lipogram or lipogrammatic pangram uses every letter of the alphabet except one. An example omitting the letter E is:Susan Elkin,Lipograms: The Presence of Absence, p. 15. :A jovial swain should not complain :Of any buxom fair :Who mocks his pain and thinks it gain :To quiz his awkward air. A longer example is \\"Fate of Nassan\\", an anonymous poem dating from pre-1870, where each stanza is a lipogrammatic pangram using every letter of the alphabet except E. > Bold Nassan quits his caravan, A hazy mountain grot to scan; Climbs jaggy > rocks to find his way, Doth tax his sight, but far doth stray. Not work of > man, nor sport of child Finds Nassan on this mazy wild; Lax grow his joints, > limbs toil in vain‚Äî Poor wight! why didst thou quit that plain? Vainly for > succour Nassan calls; Know, Zillah, that thy Nassan falls; But prowling wolf > and fox may joy To quarry on thy Arab boy. Dropping letters Another type of lipogram, which omits every instance of a letter from words that would otherwise contain it, as opposed to finding other words that do not contain the letter, was recorded by Willard R. Espy in 181 Missing O's, based on C. C. Bombaugh's univocalic 'Incontrovertible Facts'. :N mnk t gd t rb r cg r plt. :N fl s grss t blt Sctch cllps ht. :Frm Dnjn's tps n rnc rlls. :Lgwd, nt Lts, flds prt's bwls. :Bx tps, nt bttms, schl-bys flg fr sprt. :Trps f ld tsspts, ft, t st, cnsrt. :N cl mnsns blw sft n xfrd dns, :rthdx, dg-trt, bk-wrm Slmns. :Bld strgths f ghsts n hrrr shw. :n Lndn shp- frnts n hp-blssms grw. :T crcks f gld n dd lks fr fd. :n sft clth ftstls n ld fx dth brd. :Lng strm-tst slps frlrn, wrk n t prt. :Rks d nt rst n spns, nr wd-ccks snrt, :N dg n snw-drp r n cltsft rlls, :Nr cmmn frg cncct lng prtcls. Note that the above is also a conventional lipogram in omitting the letters A, E, I and U. American author James Thurber wrote The Wonderful O (1957), a fairy tale in which villains ban the letter 'O' from use by the inhabitants of the island of Oooroo. The book Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn (2001) is described as a \\"progressively lipogrammatic epistolary fable\\": the plot of the story deals with a small country which begins to outlaw the use of various letters as the tiles of each letter fall off of a statue. As each letter is outlawed within the story, it is (for the most part) no longer used in the text of the novel. It is not purely lipogrammatic, however, because the outlawed letters do appear in the text proper from time to time (the characters being penalized with banishment for their use) and when the plot requires a search for pangram sentences, all twenty-six letters are obviously in use. Also, late in the text, the author begins using letters serving as homophones for the omitted letters (i.e., PH in place of an F, G in place of C), which some might argue is cheating. At the beginning of each chapter, the alphabet appears along with a sentence, \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\". As the letters are removed from the story, the alphabet and sentence changes. :Chapter 1: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\". :Chapter 2: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY* \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog\\". :Chapter 3: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* \\"The *uick brown fox jumps over the la*y dog\\". :Chapter 4: ABCDEFGHI*KLMNOP*RSTUVWXY* \\"The *uick brown fox *umps over the la*y dog\\".Mark Dunn, Ella Minnow Pea, MP Publishing, 2010 Other examples Cipher and Poverty (The Book of Nothing), a book by Mike Schertzer (1998), is presented as the writings of \\"a prisoner whose world had been impoverished to a single utterance ... who can find me here in this silence\\". The poems that follow use only the vowels A, E, I, and O, and consonants C, D, F, H, L, M, N, R, S, T, and W, taken from that utterance. Eunoia, a book written by Canadian author Christian B√∂k (2001), is lipogrammatic. The title uses every vowel once. Each of the five chapters in this book is a lipogram. The first chapter in this book uses only words containing the vowel \\"A\\" and no other vowel. The second chapter uses only words with no vowel but \\"E\\", and so on.Christian B√∂k, Eunoia, Coach House Books, 2005 In December 2009, a collective of crime writers, Criminal Brief, published eight days of articles as a Christmas- themed lipogrammatic exercise. In June 2013, finance author Alan Corey published \\"The Subversive Job Search\\", a non-fiction lipogram that omitted the letter \\"Z\\". In the ninth episode of the ninth season of How I Met Your Mother, \\"Platonish\\", Lily and Robin challenge Barney to obtain a girl's phone number without using the letter E. A website called the Found Poetry Review asked each of its readers (as part of a larger series of challenges) to compose a poem avoiding all letters in the title of the newspaper that had already been selected. For example, if the reader was using the Washington Post, then they could not use the letters A, G, H, I, N, O, P, S, T, and W.http://www.foundpoetryreview.com/blog/oulipost-2-lipogram/ 2 April 2014 Non-English examples In Turkey the tradition of \\"Lebdeƒümez atƒ±≈üma\\" or \\"Dudak deƒümez a≈üƒ±k atƒ±≈ümasƒ±\\" (literally: two troubadours throwing verses at each other where lips do not touch each other) that is still practiced,https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lebde%C4%9Fmez Youtube search for videos of verse by verse labial lipogram song match events a form of instantaneously improvised poetry sung by opposing Ashiks taking turns for artfully criticising each other with one verse at a time, usually by each placing a pin between their upper and lower lips so that the improvised song, accompanied by a Saz (played by the ashik himself), consists only of labial lipograms i.e. without words where lips must touch each other, effectively excluding the letters B, F, M, P and V from the text of the improvised songs. The seventh- or eighth-century Dashakumaracharita by Da·πá·∏çin includes a prominent lipogrammatic section at the beginning of the seventh chapter. Mantragupta is called upon to relate his adventures. However, during the previous night of vigorous lovemaking, his lips have been nibbled several times by his beloved; as a result they are now swollen, making it painful for him to close them. Thus, throughout his narrative, he is compelled to refrain from using any labial consonants (‡§™,‡§´,‡§¨,‡§≠,‡§Æ). In France, J. R. Ronden premi√®red la Pi√®ce sans A (The Play without A) in 1816.[la Pi√®ce sans A de J. R. Ronden] Jacques Arago wrote in 1853 a version of his Voyage autour du monde (Voyage around the world), but without the letter a.Fabricio Cardenas, Vieux papiers des Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, Le voyage sans A de Jacques Arago, 17 March 2015 Georges Perec published in 1969 La Disparition, a novel without the letter e, the most commonly used letter of the alphabet in French. Its published translation into English, A Void, by Gilbert Adair, won the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1995. In Sweden a form of lipogram was developed out of necessity at the Link√∂ping University. Because files were shared and moved between computer platforms where the internal representation of the characters √Ö, √Ñ, √ñ, √•, √§, and √∂ (all moderately common vowels) were different, the tradition to write comments in source code without using those characters emerged. Zanz≈ç ni Kuchibeni o (1989) by Yasutaka Tsutsui is a lipogrammatic novel in Japanese. The first chapter is written without the syllable „ÅÇ, and usable syllables decrease as the story advances. In the last chapter, the last syllable, „Çì, vanishes and the story is closed. Zero Degree (1991) by Charu Nivedita is a lipogrammatic novel in Tamil. The entire novel is written without the common word (oru, \\"one\\", also used as the indefinite article), and there are no punctuation marks in the novel except dots. Later the novel was translated into English. Russian 18th-century poet Gavriil Derzhavin avoided the harsh R sound (and the letter that represents it) in his poem \\"The Nightingale\\" in order to render the bird's singing. The seventh-century Arab theologian Wasil ibn Ata gave a sermon without the letter rƒÅ æ (R). However, it was the 19th-century Mufti of Damascus, Mahmud Hamza \\"al-Hamzawi\\" (d. 1887), who produced perhaps the most remarkable work of this genre with a complete commentary of the Quran (published in two volumes) without dotted letters in either the introduction or interlinear commentary. This is all the more remarkable because dotted letters make up about half of the Arabic alphabet. Non-literary lipograms While a lipogram is usually limited to literary works, there are also chromatic lipograms, works of music that avoid the use of certain notes. Examples avoiding either the second, sixth, and tenth notes, or the third, seventh, and eleventh notes in a chromatic scale have been cited. Reverse lipogram A reverse lipogram, also known as an antilipophrontistery.info/liplinks.html or transgram is a type of constrained writing where each word must contain a particular letter in the text.

Siemens's name has been adopted as the SI unit of electrical conductance, the siemens. He founded the electrical and telecommunications conglomerate Siemens. Biography =Early years= Ernst Werner Siemens was born in Lenthe, today part of Gehrden, near Hannover, in the Kingdom of Hanover in the German Confederation, the fourth child (of fourteen) of a tenant farmer of the Siemens family, an old family of Goslar, documented since 1384. He was a brother of Carl Heinrich von Siemens and Carl Wilhelm Siemens, sons of Christian Ferdinand Siemens (31 July 1787 ‚Äì 16 January 1840) and wife Eleonore Deichmann (1792 ‚Äì 8 July 1839). =Middle years= After finishing school, Siemens intended to study at the Bauakademie Berlin.Werner von Siemens. \\"Inventor and entrepreneur : recollections of Werner von Siemens\\". London, England, 1966. However, since his family was highly indebted and thus could not afford to pay the tuition fees, he chose to join the Prussian Military Academy's School of Artillery and Engineering, between the years 1835‚Äì1838, instead, where he received his officers training.Werner von Siemens (1816‚Äì1892) ‚Äì Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum, Paderborn Siemens was thought of as a good soldier, receiving various medals, and inventing electrically-charged sea mines, which were used to combat a Danish blockade of Kiel. Upon returning home from war, he chose to work on perfecting technologies that had already been established and eventually became known worldwide for his advances in various technologies. In 1843 he sold the rights to his first invention to Elkington of Birmingham.Schwartz & McGuinness Einstein for Beginners Icon Books 1992 Siemens invented a telegraph that used a needle to point to the right letter, instead of using Morse code. Based on this invention, he founded the company Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens & Halske on 1 October 1847, with the company opening a workshop on 12 October. The company was internationalised soon after its founding. One brother of Werner represented him in England (Sir William Siemens) and another in St. Petersburg, Russia (Carl von Siemens), each earning recognition. Following his industrial career, he was ennobled in 1888, becoming Werner von Siemens. He retired from his company in 1890 and died in 1892 in Berlin. The company, reorganized as Siemens & Halske AG, Siemens-Schuckertwerke and ‚Äì since 1966 ‚Äì Siemens AG was later led by his brother Carl, his sons Arnold, Wilhelm, and Carl Friedrich, his grandsons Hermann and Ernst and his great-grandson Peter von Siemens. Siemens AG is one of the largest electrotechnological firms in the world. The von Siemens family still owns 6% of the company shares (as of 2013) and holds a seat on the supervisory board, being the largest shareholder. =Later years= Apart from the pointer telegraph Siemens made sufficient contributions to the development of electrical engineering that he became known as the founding father of the discipline in Germany. He built the world's first electric elevator in 1880.The History of the Elevator ‚Äì Elisha Otis His company produced the tubes with which Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen investigated x-rays. He claimed invention of the dynamo although others invented it earlier. On 14 December 1877 he received German patent No. 2355 for an electromechanical \\"dynamic\\" or moving-coil transducer, which was adapted by A. L. Thuras and E. C. Wente for the Bell System in the late 1920s for use as a loudspeaker.Ed. M. D. Fagen, \\"A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System: The Early Years\\", Bell Laboratories, 1975, p. 183. Wente's adaptation was issued in 1929. On March 1 1879, Siemens started electric Arc lamp at the street of his home in Berlin. Siemens is also the father of the trolleybus which he initially tried and tested with his \\"Elektromote\\" on 29 April 1882. =Personal life= He was married twice: first in 1852 to Mathilde Drumann (died 1 July 1867), the daughter of the historian Wilhelm Drumann; second in 1869 to his relative Antonie Siemens (1840‚Äì1900). His children from first marriage were Arnold von Siemens and Georg Wilhelm von Siemens, and his children from second marriage were Hertha von Siemens (1870 ‚Äì 5 January 1939), married in 1899 to Carl Dietrich Harries, and Carl Friedrich von Siemens.

They belong, along with Mantophasmatidae (rock crawlers), to the order Notoptera.Arillo, A. & M. Engel (2006) Rock Crawlers in Baltic Amber (Notoptera: Mantophasmatodea). American Museum Novitates 3539:1-10 Grylloblattids are tiny, most being less than 3 cm long, wingless insects with a head resembling that of a cockroach, with long antennae and having elongated cerci arising from the tip of their abdomen. They cannot tolerate warmth (most species will die at 10¬∞ C) and many species have small distribution ranges. Overview Grylloblattids, ice crawlers or icebugs puzzled the scientists who discovered them in 1914, E.M. Walker and T.B. Kurata; the first species named was Grylloblatta campodeiformis, which means \\"cricket-cockroach shaped like a Campodea\\" (a kind of two-pronged bristletail). Most are nocturnal and appear to feed on detritus. They have long antennae (23‚Äì45 segments) and long cerci (5‚Äì8 segments), but no wings. Their eyes are either missing or reduced and they have no ocelli (simple eyes). Their closest living relatives are the recently discovered Mantophasmatodea. Most species are less than 3 cm long, the largest being Namkungia magnus. The family has its own suborder, Grylloblattodea (formerly its own order). It contains 5 genera and about 34 extant species. Most species have restricted distributions and small populations and with increased warming their habitats are threatened, making them endangered. In North America some species like Grylloblatta barberi and G. oregonensis are known from single sites. Habitat and distribution Grylloblattodea are nocturnal extremophiles typically found in leaf litter and under stones in extremely cold environments, usually at higher elevations. They are known to inhabit cold temperate forests to glaciers and the edges of ice sheets. Their optimal living temperature is between 1-4 ¬∞C (33.8-39.2 ¬∞F). They can be killed at colder temperatures due to ice formation in the body, so when the temperature drops below their optimal range they survive by living under snow pack near the soil. They have a very narrow range of temperatures that they prefer and cannot withstand high temperatures; many species are killed when the temperature rises about 5¬∞C above their optimal. They move in response to the seasons so as to maintain an optimal temperature in their foraging habitat. Grylloblattidae are patchily distributed on glaciers in North America, China, Siberia, Korea and Japan. They are predicted to occur in several other mountain chains in Asia including parts of the Himalayas. Diet They are omnivorous, but feed primarily on dead arthropods and carrion. When arthropod carcasses are scarce, their diet relies heavily on plant material. The fossil species Plesioblattogryllus magnificus from the Middle Jurassic had strong mandibles and is thought to have been a predator.

He has been responsible for the design/master planning for over 200 built projects in both the U.S. and abroad. These projects include eight museums, 38 corporate headquarters, seven research facilities, performing arts centers, theaters, and campus buildings for six universities. In 1967 he created the master plan for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and henceforth designed all of the new wings and installation of many collections including the recently reopened American and Islamic wings. Born in Dublin and a graduate from University College, Roche went to the United States to study with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology. In the U.S., he became the principal designer for Eero Saarinen, and opened his own architectural firm in 1967. Among other awards, Roche received the Pritzker in 1982, the Gold Medal Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1990, and the AIA Gold Medal in 1993. Biography Born in Dublin, but raised in Mitchelstown, County Cork, Roche attended Rockwell College and graduated from University College Dublin in 1945. He then worked with Michael Scott from 1945-46. From summer to fall of 1946 he worked with Maxwell Fry in London. In 1947 he applied for graduate studies at Harvard, Yale, and the Illinois Institute of Technology and was accepted at all three institutions, and left Ireland in 1948 to study under Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Roche (right) with Eero Saarinen in the 1950s In 1949, he worked at the planning office for the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City. In 1950, he joined the firm of Eero Saarinen and Associates.\\"An Irish starchitect: the iconic buildings that have made Kevin Roche's reputation\\", The Irish Times, April 9, 2011. His future partner, John Dinkeloo (1918-1991), joined the firm in 1951 and this was also where Roche met his wife Jane. In 1954, he became the Principal Design Associate to Saarinen and assisted him on all projects from that time until Saarinen's death in September 1961. In 1966, Roche and Dinkeloo formed Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates and completed Saarinen's projects. They completed 12 major unfinished Saarinen builds, including some of Saarinen's best-known work: the Gateway Arch, the expressionistic TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport in New York City, Dulles International Airport outside Washington, DC, the strictly modern John Deere Headquarters in Moline, Illinois, and the CBS Headquarters building in New York City. Following this, Roche and Dinkeloo's first major commission was the Oakland Museum of California, a complex for the art, natural history, and cultural history of California with a design featuring interrelated terraces and roof gardens. The city was planning a monumental building to house natural history, technology and art, and Roche provided a unique concept: a building that is a series of low-level concrete structures covering a four block area, on three levels, the terrace of each level forming the roof of the one below, i.e. a museum (in three sections) with a park on its roof. This kind of innovative solution went on to become Roche's trademark. This project was followed by the equally highly acclaimed Ford Foundation building in New York City, considered the first large-scale architectural building in the US to devote a substantial portion of its space to horticultural pursuits. Its famous atrium was designed with the notion of having urban green-space accessible to all and is an early example of the application of environmental psychology in architecture. The building was recognized in 1968 by Architectural Record as \\"a new kind of urban space\\".http://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/news/2016/01-Jan/InTheCause/Ford- Foundation-Jonathan-Barnett-February-1968.pdf The acclaim that greeted the Oakland Museum and Ford Foundation earned Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates a ranking at the top of their profession. Shortly afterward they began a 40-year association with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for whom they did extensive remodeling and built many extensions to house new galleries including the one containing the Egyptian Temple of Dendur. Other high-profile commissions for the firm came from clients as varied as Wesleyan University, the United Nations, Cummins Engines, Union Carbide, The United States Post Office and the Knights of Columbus. In 1982, Kevin Roche became one of the first recipients of the Pritzker Prize, generally regarded as architecture's equivalent to the Nobel prize. Following this accolade Roche's practice went global, receiving commissions for buildings in Paris, Madrid, Singapore and Tokyo. He completed his first and only Irish project The Convention Centre Dublin in 2010. Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates has designed numerous corporate headquarters, office buildings, banks, museums, art centers, and even part of the Bronx Zoo. Roche served as a trustee of the American Academy in Rome, president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a member of the National Academy of Design, and a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.Thomas E. Luebke, ed., Civic Art: A Centennial History of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2013): Appendix B, p. 553. Death Roche died on March 1, 2019 at his home in Guilford, Connecticut, aged 96. Prizes and awards The work of Kevin Roche has been the subject of special exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Architectural Association of Ireland in Dublin, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. A 2012 exhibition Kevin Roche: Architecture as Environment opened at the Yale School of Architecture in New Haven, Connecticut and has been viewed at The Museum of the City of New York and at the Building Museum in Washington, and the University of Toronto. In addition to the Pritzker Prize, Roche was the recipient of numerous honours and awards including the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal Award, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal Award for Architecture, and the French Academie d'Architecture Grand Gold Medal.

It was founded in Chicago in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings. In 1939, they were joined by engineer John O. Merrill. The firm opened its second office, in New York City, in 1937 and has since expanded all over the world, with offices in San Francisco (1946), Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai. With a portfolio spanning thousands of projects across 50 countries, SOM is one of the most significant architectural firms in the world. The firm's notable current work includes the new headquarters for The Walt Disney Company, the global headquarters for Citigroup, Moynihan Train Hall and the expanded Penn Station complex, and the restoration and renovation of the Waldorf Astoria in New York City; airport projects at O‚ÄôHare International Airport, Kansas City International Airport, and Kempegowda International Airport; urban master plans for the Charenton-Bercy district in Paris, New Covent Garden in London, Treasure Island in SF, the East Riverfront in Detroit; P.S. 62, the first net- zero-energy school in New York Cityhttps://www.architectmagazine.com/project- gallery/ps-62-kathleen-grimm-school-for-leadership-and-sustainability_o; and the design of the Moon Village, a concept for the first permanent lunar settlement, developed with the European Space Agency and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Notable for its role as a pioneer of modernist architecture in America and for its groundbreaking work in skyscraper design,Skyscraper design and construction SOM has designed some of the world's most significant architectural and urban projects including several of the tallest buildings in the world: John Hancock Center (1969, second tallest in the world when built), Willis Tower (1973, tallest in the world for over twenty years), One World Trade Center (2014, currently the sixth tallest in the world), and Burj Khalifa (2010, currently the world's tallest building). SOM's multidisciplinary practice works across a range of scales and project types, providing services in Architecture, Building Services/MEP Engineering, Digital Design, Graphics, Interior Design, Structural Engineering, Civil Engineering, Sustainable Design and Urban Design & Planning.Adams, Nicholas. \\"Skidmore, Owings & Merrill: The Experiment since 1936.\\" Milan: Electa. 2006.  History and influence  = Pioneer of modern architecture = Many of SOM's postwar designs are recognized as icons of American modern architecture. The firm's most influential early project was Lever House, completed in 1952 to become the first International Style office building in New York City. Constructed of glass and steel at a time when Park Avenue was lined with masonry buildings, Lever House introduced a sleek modernist aesthetic that embodied the spirit of the times and influenced an entire generation of high- rise construction. As architectural historian Reyner Banham wrote in 1962, ‚ÄúIt gave architectural expression to an age just as the age was being born ... Lever House was an uncontrollable success, imitated and sometimes understood all over the Americanized world, and one of the sights of New York‚Äù.http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1277.pdf In 1982, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated Lever House an official landmark. SOM's influential modernist work in New York City included the Manufacturers Trust Company Building, completed in 1954 as the first International Style bank building in the United States, and the Pepsi-Cola World Headquarters, completed in 1960. Architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock called the Pepsi building ‚Äúthe ultimate in refinement of proportion and elegance of materials,‚Äù while New York Times critic Ada Louise Huxtable placed it \\"at the top of the list, with Seagram and Lever House, of the city's few modern landmarks.\\" The following year saw the completion of One Chase Manhattan Plaza (later 28 Liberty Street), the first International Style building to rise in New York City's Financial District. The project is noted for helping to turn the tide of a corporate exodus to Midtown Manhattan and the suburbs and reasserted Lower Manhattan as a viable business district after years of decline. SOM's design for 28 Liberty Street also transformed the crowded streetscape of the Financial District by creating a plaza surrounding the tower, a novel concept that would be adapted in many future projects. Another key example of SOM's modernist legacy is found in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where SOM master-planned a campus for the U.S. Air Force Academy. Built between 1958 and 1968, the campus broke from the traditions of West Point and Annapolis to become the first U.S. military academy designed in the modern style. The centerpiece of the campus is the Cadet Chapel, designed by architect Walter Netsch. The American Institute of Architects awarded the building with its prestigious Twenty-five Year Award, conferred on architectural works of enduring significance. = Sustainable design = SOM has a long history of innovation in sustainable architecture and design. Already in 1969, SOM founder Nathaniel Owings wrote, ‚ÄúCivilizations leave marks on the Earth by which they are known and judged. In large measure, the nature of their immortality is gauged by how well their builders made peace with the environment.‚Äù (source: Nathaniel Owings, ‚ÄúThe American Aesthetic,‚Äù Harper & Row, 1969) This ethos has shaped the firm's journey into sustainable practices. An early example is the headquarters it designed for Weyerhaeuser Company, completed in 1971, which has been called the ‚Äúoriginal green building‚Äù not only for its integration into the surrounding landscape, but also for its innovative use of efficient building systems. Another milestone in large-scale sustainable architecture was the completion of the U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters in 2007, the first federal office building to receive LEED certification. Like Weyerhaeuser, the design of the campus works in concert with its natural surroundings and incorporates a range of design strategies to reduce its environmental impact. In 2015, SOM completed the first net-zero- energy school building in New York City and one of the first worldwide. The Kathleen Grimm School for Leadership and Sustainability at Sandy Ground, Staten Island, has been awarded for its sustainability performance by organizations including the American Institute of Architects, the Municipal Art Society, and Urban Land Institute. SOM has been recognized for its research and experimentation with new energy-saving and carbon-reducing technologies, such as a timber tower and a modified concrete slab design. = High-rise innovation = In the 1970s, SOM pioneered a new era of skyscraper design with its work in Chicago, including the John Hancock Center (completed 1970) and Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower), which became the world's tallest structure upon its completion in 1973 and remained so for more than 20 years. Both towers are the result of collaboration between architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, who is often considered to be the greatest structural engineer of the 20th century. Khan invented a tubular framing system that made it possible to build higher than ever before. This system has been adapted and is still used today for some of the world's most recent tallest buildings, including the 828-meter-tall Burj Khalifa, designed by SOM and completed in 2010. = Digital design innovation = In the 1960s and 1970s, SOM was an early leader in computer-aided design, developing in- house digital tools that preceded the CAD systems used widely today. This work quickly proved valuable in the generation of structural analysis tools that were embraced by Fazlur Khan and his engineering team, aiding the design of projects such as the John Hancock Center. The activity of an experimental research group at SOM known as the Computer Group exemplifies a particularly productive effort within the firm to incorporate technological research into its practice. Through the 1970s and 1980s, members of the relatively small, dedicated group pushed to integrate the computer's enhanced data-storing and analytical abilities into various phases of the design process. Through these initiatives, SOM was able to identify the potential of the computer to not only expedite necessary calculations but also introduce new ways of representing and sharing information. Just as structural engineering came to be seen early on at SOM as a means of generating rather than simply realizing architectural ideas, with concerted effort, computers gained credence at the firm, and eventually throughout the industry, as a catalyst for architectural innovation. In 1980, an in-house team at SOM created Architecture Engineering Systems, a computer program that was used to study complex structural systems and energy demands. This program is regarded as a precursor to the array of building information modeling (BIM) tools now used by the profession. = Integrating art and architecture = For decades, many of SOM's projects have featured works of art by significant artists. In many cases, the firm's architects and engineers played an essential role in commissioning, engineering, and installing the artworks‚Äîsuch as with the Chicago Picasso, a 50-foot-tall steel sculpture in the city's civic center. Joan Mir√≥, Alexander Calder, Isamu Noguchi, Harry Bertoia, Richard Lippold, and Jean Dubuffet are among the artists whose work has been an integral part of SOM projects. More recently, SOM's architects and engineers have collaborated with artists such as James Turrell, Janet Echelman, I√±igo Manglano‚ÄìOvalle, James Carpenter, and Jaume Plensa. People SOM is structured as a partnership. The current partners and consulting partners are: Mustafa Abadan, Stephen Apking, William Baker, David Childs, Thomas Behr, Keith Boswell, Carrie Byles, Larry Chien, Leo Chow, Brant Coletta, Chris Cooper, Paul Danna, Michael Duncan, Scott Duncan, Philip Enquist, Laura Ettelman, Xuan Fu, T.J. Gottesdiener, Gary Haney, Craig Hartman, Kent Jackson, Colin Koop, Brian Lee, Kenneth Lewis, Adam Semel, Jonathan Stein, and Douglas Voigt. =Founders and notable architects= Gordon Bunshaft, who thrived as a design leader at SOM for more than 40 years, received the profession's highest honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 1988. Notable architects who are associated with SOM include: T. J. Gottesdiener, Edward Charles Bassett, Natalie de Blois, Gordon Bunshaft, David Childs, Robert Diamant, Myron Goldsmith, Bruce Graham, Gary Haney, Craig W. Hartman, Gertrude Kerbis, Fazlur Rahman Khan. Lucien Lagrange, Walter Netsch, Larry Oltmanns, Eszter P√©csi, Brigitte Peterhans, Norma Merrick Sklarek, Adrian Smith, and Marilyn Jordan Taylor SOM Foundation The SOM Foundation was first established in 1979 with the mission to support and cultivate emerging design leaders by granting awards to outstanding students of architecture, design, urban design, and engineering. Many winners of SOM Foundation awards have gone on to distinguish themselves in professional and academic careers. Notable past winners include Marion Weiss (1982), [2] Werner Sobek (1983), [3] Himanshu Parikh (1985),[4] Santiago Calatrava (1988),[5] and Joshua Ramus (1995).[6] The SOM Foundation continues to support emerging design leaders and interdisciplinary research with five annual awards granted to students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Awards Throughout its history, SOM has been recognized with more than 2000 awards for quality and innovation. In 1996 and 1962, SOM received the Architecture Firm AwardList of AIA Firm Award Recipients http://www.aia.org/practicing/awards/AIAS075259 from the American Institute of Architects, which recognizes the design work of an entire firm. SOM is the only firm to have received this honor twice. In August 2009 SOM received four of 13 available R+D Awards from Architect Magazine. In addition, a collaboration between SOM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, The Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology, was honored with a fifth award.  Disciplines  = Urban design and planning = Since the firm's founding, SOM has led large scale urban design and planning projects. Many of these projects have had a lasting role in the development of cities and urban areas in America and the world, including London, Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Denver, and Portland, Oregon. SOM's City Design practice has made influential contributions to urban design approaches such as transit-oriented development, overbuild strategies and sustainable urbanism. In 1942, SOM was hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a highly confidential project: the planning of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By 1945, the town was home to 75,000 people. The work at Oak Ridge prepared SOM to take on the large-scale architectural and planning projects that would define the postwar era. For more than 20 years, SOM was involved in the development of a master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Nathaniel Owings as chair of the Pennsylvania Avenue redesign council, and the resulting 1966 Washington Mall Master Plan laid the framework for a dynamic, inviting, and pedestrian-friendly place. A second master plan developed in 1973, envisioned the construction of major cultural facilities, including the National Air and Space Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, and the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. In Baltimore in the 1960s, SOM played a pivotal role in preventing the destruction of the city's historic districts and Inner Harbor to make way for the planned construction of an elevated highway. As the chair of a team to develop an alternate plan, Nathaniel Owings convinced the Federal Highway Administration to sign off on a plan to reroute the highway. It eventually built around the harbor and the historic Federal Hill district, saving these irreplaceable neighborhoods. In the 1970s, SOM collaborated with landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to plan and design the Portland Transit Mall. The goals were to revitalize the Oregon city's downtown area, to encourage the use of mass transit, and create walkable streets. The Transit Mall helped to change the perception of downtown Portland. As one of the first projects of its kind in the United States, it helped to usher in an era of streetscape design that prioritizes people. Another important commission in the 1970s was as the lead design firm for the Boston Transportation Planning Review, a metropolitan wide re-design of Boston's entire transit and roadway infrastructure. Beginning in the 1980s, SOM planned the design and construction of Canary Wharf in London. Intended to accommodate a flourishing financial sector and revitalize London's former Docklands, the plan included more than 20 building sites and a host of public spaces and amenities. The plan also provided for a robust transportation network including a light rail station that connects to the London Underground. The massive scale of the project led to the opening of SOM's London office in 1986. The firm's work at Canary Wharf continued into the new millennium, with the completion of Five Canada Square in 2002. In central London, the opportunity to build above rail lines near Liverpool Street Station spurred the construction of Broadgate, a new business district. SOM devised the master plan, and over three decades, designed several of the site's 14 buildings. In order to build high-rise structures atop one of the city's busiest stations and its railyard, SOM's structural engineering team devised a deck over the tracks to allow for various building configurations on top. Exchange House, completed in 1990, is a building that acts as a bridge spanning the tracks. In 2008, Broadgate Tower, the district's tallest building, was completed. SOM also designed public space enhancements for the area. SOM designed the master plan for Chicago's Millennium Park, which opened in 2004 and has become one of the city's most visited attractions. Constructed above bus lanes, parking garages, and a rail yard, Millennium Park can be considered the world's largest roof garden. Below the great lawn, two new levels of parking were built, bus stops were added, and rail stations were renovated and expanded, including Millennium Station. The project revitalized a formerly blighted downtown site and marked the completion of Chicago planner Daniel Burnham‚Äôs 100-year vision for the area. In Denver, SOM was commissioned to expand and transform the city‚Äôs historic Union Station into a major regional hub. 20 acres of former rail yards have been converted into a transit-oriented urban district that orchestrates light rail, pedestrian, bicycle, and bus routes, as well as commuter and intercity rail. Completed in 2014, the project has spurred more than $3.5 billion worth of private investment in the surrounding district.https://www.rtd-denver.com/projects/union-station-tod-project. =Structural engineering= The earliest SOM engineer was John O. Merrill.FundingUniverse: SOM company history. Fazlur Khan, another engineer at SOM, is best known for his design and construction of the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), and John Hancock Center and for his designs of structural systems that remain fundamental to all high-rise skyscrapers.Ali Mir (2001), Art of the Skyscraper: the Genius of Fazlur Khan, Rizzoli International Publications, Indeed, Khan is responsible for developing the algorithms that made the Hancock building and many subsequent skyscrapers possible. Another notable SOM engineer is Bill Baker, who is best known as the engineer of Burj Khalifa (Dubai, 2010), the world's tallest man-made structure. To support the tower's record heights and slim footprint, he developed the \\"buttressed core\\"Engineer Bill Baker Is the King of Superstable 150-Story Structures, Wired.com structural system, consisting of a hexagonal core reinforced by three buttresses that form a Y shape. =Interior design= Davis Allen, a pioneer in corporate interior design, had a forty-year tenure at SOM.Pace, Eric. \\"Davis Allen, 82, a Designer Of Modern Business Interiors,\\" New York Times.

Like most other flying insects (flies, beetles, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), they evolved in the early Mesozoic era. Their prototypes, the giant dragonflies of the Carboniferous, 325 mya, are no longer placed in the Odonata but included in the Protodonata or Meganisoptera. The two common groups are easily distinguished: *Dragonflies: these are placed in the suborder Epiprocta (= usually larger, eyes together & wings up or out at rest) *Damselflies: they are Zygoptera (= usually smaller, eyes apart & wings along body at rest) The giant Upper Carboniferous dragonfly ancestor, Meganeura monyi, had a wingspan of about . Museum of Toulouse All Odonata have aquatic larvae called 'nymphs', and all of them, larvae and adults, are carnivorous. The adults can land, but rarely walk. Their legs are specialised for catching prey. They are almost entirely insectivorous.  Etymology and terminology Fabricius coined the term Odonata from the Ancient Greek (Ionic form of ) 'tooth' apparently because they have teeth on their mandibles, even though most insects also have toothed mandibles. The word dragonfly is also sometimes used to refer to all Odonata, but odonate is a more correct English name for the group as a whole. Odonata enthusiasts avoid ambiguity by using the term true dragonfly, or simply anisopteran, when referring to just the Anisoptera. The term Warriorfly has also been proposed. Some 5,900 species have been described in this order.  Systematics and taxonomy  This order has traditionally been grouped together with the mayflies and several extinct orders in a group called the \\"Paleoptera\\", but this grouping might be paraphyletic. What they do share with mayflies is the nature of how the wings are articulated and held in rest (see insect flight for a detailed discussion). In some treatments,E.g. Trueman & Rowe (2008) the Odonata are understood in an expanded sense, essentially synonymous with the superorder Odonatoptera but not including the prehistoric Protodonata. In this approach, instead of Odonatoptera, the term Odonatoidea is used. The systematics of the \\"Palaeoptera\\" are by no means resolved; what can be said however is that regardless of whether they are called \\"Odonatoidea\\" or \\"Odonatoptera\\", the Odonata and their extinct relatives do form a clade.Trueman [2008] The Anisoptera was long treated as a suborder, with a third suborder, the \\"Anisozygoptera\\" (ancient dragonflies). However, the combined suborder Epiprocta (in which Anisoptera is an infraorder) was proposed when it was found that the \\"Anisozygoptera\\" was paraphyletic, composed of mostly extinct offshoots of dragonfly evolution. The four living species placed in that group are (in this treatment) in the infraorder Epiophlebioptera, whereas the fossil taxa that were formerly there are now dispersed about the Odonatoptera (or Odonata sensu lato).Lohmann (1996), Rehn (2003) World Odonata List considers Anisoptera as a suborder along with Zygoptera and Anisozygoptera as well- understood and widely preferred terms.Dijkstra, K-D.

(CD-ROM)  External morphology  = Size = The largest living odonate is the giant Central American helicopter damselfly Megaloprepus coerulatus (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a wing span of 191 mm. The heaviest living odonates are Tetracanthagyna plagiata (Anisoptera: Aeshnidae) with a wing span of 165 mm, and Petalura ingentissima (Anisoptera: Petaluridae) with a body length of 117 mm (some sources 125 mm) and wing span of 160 mm. The longest extant odonate is the Neotropical helicopter damselfly Mecistogaster linearis (Zygoptera: Pseudostigmatidae) with a body length of 135 mm. Sometimes the giant Hawaiian darner Anax strenuus (Anisoptera: Aeshnidae) is claimed to be the largest living odonate with an alleged wing span of 190 mm, but this seems to be a myth as only 152 mm wing spans are scientifically documented. Odonata and their ancestors come from one of the oldest winged insect groups. The fossils of odonates and their cousins, including Paleozoic \\"giant dragonflies\\" like Meganeuropsis permiana from the Permian of North America, reached wing spans of up to 71 cmDragonfly ‚Äì The largest complete insect wing ever foundMitchell, F.L. and Lasswell, J. (2005): A dazzle of dragonflies Texas A&M; University Press, 224 pages: page 47 and a body length of 43 cm, making it the largest insect of all time. This insect belonged to the order Meganisoptera, the griffinflies, related to odonates but not part of the modern order Odonata in the restricted sense. They have one of the most complete fossil records going back 319 million years. The smallest living dragonfly is Nannophya pygmaea (Anisoptera: Libellulidae) from east Asia, with a body length of 15 mm and a wing span of 20 mm. The smallest damselflies (and also the smallest odonates) are species of the genus Agriocnemis (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae) with a wing span of only 17‚Äì18 mm. = Description = Male blue ringtail (Austrolestes annulosus), a damselfly (Zygoptera: Lestidae) Dragonfly (top) and damselfly (bottom) wing shape and venation These insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by well-developed, compound eyes, legs that facilitate catching prey (other insects) in flight, two pairs of long, transparent wings that move independently, and elongated abdomens. They have three ocelli and short antennae. The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult. Flight in the Odonata is direct, with flight muscles attaching directly to the wings; rather than indirect, with flight muscles attaching to the thorax, as is found in the Neoptera. This allows active control of the amplitude, frequency, angle of attack, camber and twist of each of the four wings entirely independently.Richard J. Bomphrey, Toshiyuki Nakata, Per Henningsson, Huai-Ti Lin (2016) Flight of the dragonflies and damselflies, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 371 20150389; DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2015.0389. In most families there is a structure on the leading edge near the tip of the wing called the pterostigma. This is a thickened, hemolymph‚Äìfilled and often colorful area bounded by veins. The functions of the pterostigma are not fully known, but it most probably has an aerodynamic effect and may also have a visual function. More mass at the end of the wing may also reduce the energy needed to move the wings up and down. The right combination of wing stiffness and wing mass could reduce the energy consumption of flying. A pterostigma is also found among other insects, such as bees. The nymphs have stockier, shorter, bodies than the adults. In addition to lacking wings, their eyes are smaller, their antennae longer, and their heads are less mobile than in the adult. Their mouthparts are modified, with the labium being adapted into a unique prehensile organ for grasping prey. Damselfly nymphs breathe through external gills on the abdomen, while dragonfly nymphs respire through an organ in their rectum. Damselflies in copulatory \\"wheel\\" Although generally fairly similar, dragonflies differ from damselflies in several, easily recognizable traits. Dragonflies are strong fliers with fairly robust bodies and at rest hold their wings either out to the side or out and downward (or even somewhat forward). Damselflies tend to be less robust, even rather weak appearing in flight, and when at rest most species hold their wings folded back over the abdomen (see photograph below, left). Dragonfly eyes occupy much of the animal's head, touching (or nearly touching) each other across the face. In damselflies, there is typically a gap in between the eyes.  Ecology and life cycle  Ovipositing flight of two azure damselfly couples (Coenagrion puella) Odonates are aquatic or semi- aquatic as juveniles. Thus, adults are most often seen near bodies of water and are frequently described as aquatic insects. However, many species range far from water. They are carnivorous (or more specifically insectivorous) throughout their life, mostly feeding on smaller insects. Male Odonata have complex genitalia, different from those found in other insects. These include grasping cerci for holding the female and a secondary set of copulatory organs on the abdomen in which the sperm are held after being produced by the primary genitals. To mate, the male grasps the female by the thorax or head and bends her abdomen so that her own genitalia can be grasped by the copulatory organs holding the sperm. Male odonates have a copulatory organ on the ventral side of abdominal segment 2 in which they store spermatozoa; they mate by holding the female's head (Anisoptera) or thorax (Zygoptera) with claspers located at the tip of the male abdomen; the female bends her abdomen forward to touch the male organ and receive sperm. This is called the \\"wheel\\" position. Eggs are laid in water or on vegetation near water or wet places, and hatch to produce pronymphs which live off the nutrients that were in the egg. They then develop into instars with approximately 9‚Äì14 molts that are (in most species) voracious predators on other aquatic organisms, including small fishes. The nymphs grow and molt, usually in dusk or dawn, into the flying teneral immature adults, whose color is not yet developed. These insects later transform into reproductive adults. Odonates can act as bioindicators of water quality in rivers because they rely on high quality water for proper development in early life. Since their diet consists entirely of insects, odonate density is directly proportional to the population of prey, and their abundance indicates the abundance of prey in the examined ecosystem.Golfieri, B., Hardersen, S., Maiolini, B., & Surian, N. (2016). Odonates as indicators of the ecological integrity of the river corridor: Development and application of the Odonate River Index (ORI) in northern Italy. Ecological Indicators, 61, 234-247. Species richness of vascular plants has also been positively correlated with the species richness of dragonflies in a given habitat. This means that in a location such as a lake, if one finds a wide variety of odonates, then a similarly wide variety of plants should also be present. This correlation is not common to all bioindicators, as some may act as indicators for a different environmental factor, such as the pool frog acting as a bioindicator of water quality due to its high quantity of time spent in and around water. In addition, odonates are very sensitive to changes to average temperature. Many species have moved to higher elevations and latitudes as global temperature rises and habitats dry out. Changes to the life cycle have been recorded with increased development of the instar stages and smaller adult body size as the average temperature increases. As the territory of many species starts to overlap, the rate hybridization of species that normally do not come in contact is increasing. If global climate change continues many members of Odonata will start to disappear. Because odonates are such an old order and have such a complete fossil record they are an ideal species to study insect evolution and adaptation. For example, they are one of the first insects to develop flight and it is likely that this trait only evolved once in insects, looking at how flight works in odonates, the rest of flight can be mapped out.

Constraints are very common in poetry, which often requires the writer to use a particular verse form. Description Constraints on writing are common and can serve a variety of purposes. For example, a text may place restrictions on its vocabulary, e.g. Basic English, copula-free text, defining vocabulary for dictionaries, and other limited vocabularies for teaching English as a second language or to children. In poetry, formal constraints abound in both mainstream and experimental work. Familiar elements of poetry like rhyme and meter are often applied as constraints. Well-established verse forms like the sonnet, sestina, villanelle, limerick, and haiku are variously constrained by meter, rhyme, repetition, length, and other characteristics. Outside of established traditions, particularly in the avant-garde, writers have produced a variety of work under more severe constraints; this is often what the term \\"constrained writing\\" is specifically applied to. For example: * Reverse- lipograms: each word must contain a particular letter. * Univocalic poetry, using only one vowel. * Mandated vocabulary, where the writer must include specific words (for example, Quadrivial QuandaryQuadrivialQUandary.com solicits individual sentences containing all four words in a daily selection). * Bilingual homophonous poetry, where the poem makes sense in two different languages at the same time, constituting two simultaneous homophonous poems.Bilingual Homophonous Poetry ‚Äì Italo-Hebraic Bilingual Homophonous Poem by linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann, in which the Hebrew poem sounds identical to the Italian one, both making full sense ‚Äì see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2006), \\"Shir Du-Leshoni\\" (Bilingual Poem), Ho!, Literary Magazine 3, pp. 256‚Äì257. * Alliteratives or tautograms, in which every word must start with the same letter (or subset of letters; see Alphabetical Africa). * Lipogram: a letter (commonly e or o) is outlawed. * Acrostics: first letter of each word/sentence/paragraph forms a word or sentence. * Abecedarius: first letter of each word/verse/section goes through the alphabet. * Palindromes, such as the word \\"radar\\", read the same forwards and backwards. * Anglish, favouring Anglo-Saxon words over Greek and Roman/Latin words. * Pilish, where the lengths of consecutive words match the digits of the number œÄ. * Anagrams, words or sentences formed by rearranging the letters of another. * Limitations in punctuation, such as Peter Carey's book True History of the Kelly Gang, which features no commas. * One syllable article, a form unique to Chinese literature, using many characters all of which are homophones; the result looks sensible as writing but is very confusing when read aloud. * Chaterism, where the length of words in a phrase or sentence increases or decreases in a uniform, mathematical way. * Aleatory, where the reader supplies a random input. * Erasure, which involves erasing words from an existing text and framing the result on the page as a poem. The Oulipo group is a gathering of writers who use such techniques. The Outrapo group uses theatrical constraints. There are a number of constrained writing forms that are restricted by length, including: * Six-Word Memoirs: 6 words * Haiku: ~ 3 lines (5‚Äì7‚Äì5 syllables or 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 beats recommended.) * Minisaga: 50 words, +15 for title * Drabble: 100 words * Twiction: espoused as a specifically constrained form of microfiction where a story or poem is exactly 140 characters long. * Sijo: three lines average 14‚Äì16 syllables, for a total of 44‚Äì46: theme (3, 4,4,4); elaboration (3,4,4,4); counter-theme (3,5) and completion (4,3).  Examples  * Ernest Vincent Wright's Gadsby (1939) is an English-language novel consisting of 50,000 words, none of which contain the letter \\"e\\". * In 1969, French writer Georges Perec published La Disparition, a novel that did not include the letter \\"e\\". It was translated into English in 1995 by Gilbert Adair. Perec subsequently joked that he incorporated the \\"e\\"s not used into La Disparition in the novella ' (1972), which uses no vowels other than \\"e\\". Les Revenentes was translated into English by Ian Monk as The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex. * Perec also wrote Life A User's Manual using the Knight's Tour method of construction. The book is set in a fictional Parisian block of flats, where Perec devises the elevation of the building as a 10√ó10 grid: 10 storeys, including basements and attics and 10 rooms across, including 2 for the stairwell. Each room is assigned to a chapter, and the order of the chapters is given by the knight's moves on the grid. * Several of the Psalms are abecedarian in the Hebrew alphabet * The 2004 French novel Le Train de Nulle Part (The Train from Nowhere) by Michel Thaler was written entirely without verbs.A New Novel, No Verbs, in France, No Less by Scott McLemee, The Chronicle of Higher Education, June 2, 2004. * let me tell you (2008), a novel by the Welsh writer Paul Griffiths, uses only the words allotted to Ophelia in Hamlet. * Experimental Canadian poet Christian B√∂k‚Äôs Eunoia is a univocalic that uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters. * One famous piece of constrained writing in the Chinese language is The Lion- Eating Poet in the Stone Den which consists of 92 characters, all with the sound shi. Another is the Thousand Character Classic in which all 1000 characters are unique without any repetition. * \\"Cadaeic Cadenza\\" is a short story by Mike Keith using the first 3835 digits of pi to determine the length of words. Not A Wake is a book using the same constraint based on the first 10,000 digits. * Never Again is a novel by Doug Nufer in which no word is used more than once. * Ella Minnow Pea is a book by Mark Dunn where certain letters become unusable throughout the novel. * Alphabetical Africa is a book by Walter Abish in which the first chapter only uses words that begin with the letter \\"a\\", while the second chapter incorporates the letter \\"b\\", and then \\"c\\", etc. Once the alphabet is finished, Abish takes letters away, one at a time, until the last chapter, leaving only words that begin with the letter \\"a\\". * Mary Godolphin wrote versions of Robinson Crusoe, Aesop's Fables, The Swiss Family Robinson, and other books using only monosyllabic words. * Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, wrote the well-known children's book Green Eggs and Ham using only 50 different words on a 50 dollar bet with Bennett Cerf.Urban Legends Reference Pages: Language (Green Eggs and Ham), Snopes, Accessed on 26 November 2006. * The Gates of Paradise is a book by Jerzy Andrzejewski where the whole text is just two sentences, one of which is very long. * Zero Degree is a postmodern lipogrammatic novel written in 1998 by Tamil author Charu Nivedita, later translated into Malayalam and English. The Tamil words 'oru' and 'ondru' (the English equivalents are 'a', 'an' and 'one') have not been mentioned anywhere in the novel, except one chapter. Keeping with the numerological theme of Zero Degree, the only numbers expressed in either words or symbols are numerologically equivalent to nine (with the exception of two chapters). This Oulipian ban includes the very common word one.

Peccaries evolved in Europe about 30 million years ago and spread across much of the world. In the Old World, peccaries went extinct, but they survived in North America. About three million years ago, peccaries spread into South America. Mayans kept herds of peccaries, using them in rituals and for food. They are kept as pets in many countries, in addition to being raised on farms as a source of food.Commercial farming of collared peccary: A Large-scale commercial farming of collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) in North-Eastern Brazil.

The word \\"javelina\\" derives from the Spanish word for \\"wild boar\\".\\"javelina\\" In Portuguese, a peccary is called pecari, porco-do-mato, queixada, or taja√ßu, among other names; in Spanish, it is javelina, jabal√≠ (a word also used to describe wild boar), sajino, or pecar√≠; in French Guiana and Suriname, it is pakira. The scientific name Tayassuidae derives the same source as the Portuguese taja√ßu.A. B. H. Ferreira, Novo Dicion√°rio da L√≠ngua Portuguesa, second edition (Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 1986), page 1530 Characteristics Skulls of wild boar (left) and white-lipped peccary (right): Note how the upper canines of the peccary point downwards. A peccary is a medium-sized animal, with a strong resemblance to a pig. Like a pig, it has a snout ending in a cartilaginous disc, and eyes that are small relative to its head. Also like a pig, it uses only the middle two digits for walking, although, unlike pigs, the other toes may be altogether absent. Its stomach is not ruminating, although it has three chambers, and is more complex than those of pigs. Peccaries are omnivores, and will eat insects, grubs, and occasionally small animals, although their preferred foods consist of roots, grasses, seeds, fruit, and cacti‚Äîparticularly prickly pear. Pigs and peccaries can be differentiated by the shape of the canine tooth, or tusk. In European pigs, the tusk is long and curves around on itself, whereas in peccaries, the tusk is short and straight. The jaws and tusks of peccaries are adapted for crushing hard seeds and slicing into plant roots, and they also use their tusks for defending against predators. The dental formula for peccaries is: By rubbing the tusks together, they can make a chattering noise that warns potential predators to stay away. In recent years in northwestern Bolivia near Madidi National Park, large groups of peccaries have been reported to have seriously injured or killed people.Madidi Diary ‚Äì Joel Sartore. Sartorestock.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-18. Peccaries are social animals, and often form herds. Over 100 individuals have been recorded for a single herd of white-lipped peccaries, but collared and Chacoan peccaries usually form smaller groups. Such social behavior seems to have been the situation in extinct peccaries, as well. The recently discovered giant peccary (Pecari maximus) of Brazil appears to be less social, primarily living in pairs. Peccaries rely on their social structure to defend territory, protect against predators, regulate temperature, and interact socially. Peccaries have scent glands below each eye and another on their backs, though these are believed to be rudimentary in P. maximus. They use the scent to mark herd territories, which range from . They also mark other herd members with these scent glands by rubbing one against another. The pungent odor allows peccaries to recognize other members of their herd, despite their myopic vision. The odor is strong enough to be detected by humans, which earns the peccary the nickname of \\"skunk pig\\". Species Three (possibly four) living species of peccaries are found from the Southwestern United States through Central America and into South America and Trinidad. The collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) or \\"musk hog\\", referring to the animal's scent glands, occurs from the Southwestern United States into South America and the island of Trinidad. The coat consists of wiry peppered black, gray, and brown hair with a lighter colored \\"collar\\" circling the shoulders. They bear young year-round, but most often between November and March, with the average litter size consisting of two to three offspring. They are found in many habitats, from arid scrublands to humid tropical rain forests. The collared peccary is well-adapted to habitat disturbed by humans, merely requiring sufficient cover. They can be found in cities and agricultural land throughout their range. Notable populations exist in the suburbs of Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, where they feed on ornamental plants and other cultivated vegetation. There are also urban populations as far north as Prescott, where they have been known to fill a niche similar to raccoons and other urban scavengers. In Arizona they are often called \\"javelinas\\". Collared peccaries are generally found in bands of 8 to 15 animals of various ages. They defend themselves if they feel threatened, but otherwise tend to ignore humans. A second species, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), is mainly found in rainforests of Central and South America, but also known from a wide range of other habitats such as dry forests, grasslands, mangrove, cerrado, and dry xerophytic areas. The third species, the Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri), is the closest living relative to the extinct Platygonus pearcei. It is found in the dry shrub habitat or Chaco of Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. The Chacoan peccary has the distinction of having been first described based on fossils and was originally thought to be an extinct species. In 1975, the animal was discovered in the Chaco region of Paraguay. The species was well known to the native people. A fourth as yet unconfirmed species, the giant peccary (Pecari maximus), was described from the Brazilian Amazon and north BoliviaMoravec, J., & B√∂hme, W. (2009).

Fossils have later been found in all continents except Australia and Antarctica. Peccaries became extinct in the Old World sometime after the Miocene period, possibly because of competition from evolving pigs. Extinct genera include the Miocene-aged Macrogenis and Floridachoerus.White, T. E. 1942. The Lower Miocene mammal fauna of Florida. Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 92(1):1‚Äì49. Simojovelhyus, known from a lower partial mandible with three molars from late Oligocene strata near the town of Simojovel in Chiapas, Mexico, was originally described as a helohyid. Although common in South America today, peccaries did not reach there until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America. At that time, many North American animals‚Äîincluding peccaries, llamas and tapirs‚Äîentered South America, while some South American species, such as the ground sloths and opossums, migrated north.McDonald, Greg (1999-03-27) Pearce's Peccary ‚Äì Platygonus Pearcei. Hagerman Fossil Beds' Critter Corner. Several species of peccary across the genera Platygonus and Mylohyus remained in North America until their extinction following the colonization of the continent by humans via Beringia at the end of the Pleistocene. Today, 2 of the 3 species are relegated to the Neotropical realm, but the collared peccary ranges into northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. Domestication Peccaries bear a superficial resemblance to pigs and are in the same subfamily Suinae as swine, and have been present in South America since prehistoric times. The earliest scientific description of peccaries in the New World is in Brazil in 1547 and referred to them as \\"wild pigs.\\" It has been documented that peccaries were tamed, penned, and raised for food and ritual purposes in the Yucatan, Panama, the southern Caribbean, and Colombia at the time of the Conquest. Archaeological remains of peccaries have been found in Mesoamerica from the Preclassic (or Formative) period up until immediately before Spanish contact. Specifically, peccary remains have been found at Early Formative Olmec civilization sites.

Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States and Canada used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaebacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in countries like Great Britain, India, Greece, Brazil and other countries use five kingdoms only (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \\"kingdom\\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor.  Definition and associated terms  When Carl Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \\"kingdom\\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species.See e.g. , In 1990, the rank of domain was introduced above kingdom. Prefixes can be added so subkingdom (subregnum) and infrakingdom (also known as infraregnum) are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank branch (Latin: ramus) can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom, e.g., Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith. History =Two kingdoms of life= The classification of living things into animals and plants is an ancient one. Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC) classified animal species in his History of Animals, while his pupil Theophrastus (c. 371‚Äìc. 287 BC) wrote a parallel work, the Historia Plantarum, on plants. Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) laid the foundations for modern biological nomenclature, now regulated by the Nomenclature Codes, in 1735. He distinguished two kingdoms of living things: Regnum Animale ('animal kingdom') and Regnum Vegetabile ('vegetable kingdom', for plants). Linnaeus also included minerals in his classification system, placing them in a third kingdom, Regnum Lapideum. =Three kingdoms of life= Haeckel's original (1866) conception of the three kingdoms of life, including the new kingdom Protista. Notice the inclusion of the cyanobacterium Nostoc with plants. In 1674, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, often called the \\"father of microscopy\\", sent the Royal Society of London a copy of his first observations of microscopic single-celled organisms. Until then, the existence of such microscopic organisms was entirely unknown. Despite this, Linnaeus did not include any microscopic creatures in his original taxonomy. At first, microscopic organisms were classified within the animal and plant kingdoms. However, by the mid‚Äì19th century, it had become clear to many that \\"the existing dichotomy of the plant and animal kingdoms [had become] rapidly blurred at its boundaries and outmoded\\". In 1860 John Hogg proposed the third kingdom of life Protoctista composed of ‚Äúall the lower creatures, or the primary organic beings\\". In 1866, Ernst Haeckel also proposed a third kingdom of life, the Protista, for \\"neutral organisms\\" or \\"the kingdom of primitive forms\\", which were neither animal nor plant. Haeckel revised the content of this kingdom a number of times before settling on a division based on whether organisms were unicellular (Protista) or multicellular (animals and plants). =Four kingdoms= The development of microscopy revealed important distinctions between those organisms whose cells do not have a distinct nucleus (prokaryotes) and organisms whose cells do have a distinct nucleus (eukaryotes). In 1925 √âdouard Chatton introduced the terms \\"prokaryote\\" and \\"eukaryote\\" to differentiate these organisms. In 1938, Herbert F. Copeland proposed a four-kingdom classification by creating the novel Kingdom Monera of prokaryotic organisms; as a revised phylum Monera of the Protista, it included organisms now classified as Bacteria and Archaea. Ernst Haeckel, in his 1904 book The Wonders of Life, had placed the blue-green algae (or Phycochromacea) in Monera; this would gradually gain acceptance, and the blue-green algae would become classified as bacteria in the phylum Cyanobacteria. In the 1960s, Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel promoted and popularized √âdouard Chatton's earlier work, particularly in their paper of 1962, \\"The Concept of a Bacterium\\"; this created, for the first time, a rank above kingdoma superkingdom or empirewith the two-empire system of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The two-empire system would later be expanded to the three-domain system of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota. =Five kingdoms= The differences between fungi and other organisms regarded as plants had long been recognised by some; Haeckel had moved the fungi out of Plantae into Protista after his original classification, but was largely ignored in this separation by scientists of his time. Robert Whittaker recognized an additional kingdom for the Fungi. The resulting five-kingdom system, proposed in 1969 by Whittaker, has become a popular standard and with some refinement is still used in many works and forms the basis for new multi-kingdom systems. It is based mainly upon differences in nutrition; his Plantae were mostly multicellular autotrophs, his Animalia multicellular heterotrophs, and his Fungi multicellular saprotrophs. The remaining two kingdoms, Protista and Monera, included unicellular and simple cellular colonies. The five kingdom system may be combined with the two empire system. In the Whittaker system, Plantae included some algae. In other systems, such as Lynn Margulis's system of five kingdoms, the plants included just the land plants (Embryophyta), and Protoctista has a broader definition. Following publication of Whittaker's system, the five-kingdom model began to be commonly used in high school biology textbooks. But despite the development from two kingdoms to five among most scientists, some authors as late as 1975 continued to employ a traditional two-kingdom system of animals and plants, dividing the plant kingdom into subkingdoms Prokaryota (bacteria and cyanobacteria), Mycota (fungi and supposed relatives), and Chlorota (algae and land plants). =Six kingdoms= In 1977, Carl Woese and colleagues proposed the fundamental subdivision of the prokaryotes into the Eubacteria (later called the Bacteria) and Archaebactera (later called the Archaea), based on ribosomal RNA structure; this would later lead to the proposal of three \\"domains\\" of life, of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Combined with the five-kingdom model, this created a six-kingdom model, where the kingdom Monera is replaced by the kingdoms Bacteria and Archaea. This six-kingdom model is commonly used in recent US high school biology textbooks, but has received criticism for compromising the current scientific consensus. But the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms remains in use with the recent seven kingdoms scheme of Thomas Cavalier-Smith, although it primarily differs in that Protista is replaced by Protozoa and Chromista. =Eight kingdoms= Thomas Cavalier-Smith supported the consensus at that time, that the difference between Eubacteria and Archaebacteria was so great (particularly considering the genetic distance of ribosomal genes) that the prokaryotes needed to be separated into two different kingdoms. He then divided Eubacteria into two subkingdoms: Negibacteria (Gram negative bacteria) and Posibacteria (Gram positive bacteria). Technological advances in electron microscopy allowed the separation of the Chromista from the Plantae kingdom. Indeed, the chloroplast of the chromists is located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum instead of in the cytosol. Moreover, only chromists contain chlorophyll c. Since then, many non-photosynthetic phyla of protists, thought to have secondarily lost their chloroplasts, were integrated into the kingdom Chromista. Finally, some protists lacking mitochondria were discovered. As mitochondria were known to be the result of the endosymbiosis of a proteobacterium, it was thought that these amitochondriate eukaryotes were primitively so, marking an important step in eukaryogenesis. As a result, these amitochondriate protists were separated from the protist kingdom, giving rise to the, at the same time, superkingdom and kingdom Archezoa. This superkingdom was opposed to the Metakaryota superkingdom, grouping together the five other eukaryotic kingdoms (Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista). This was known as the Archezoa hypothesis, which has since been abandoned; later schemes did not include the Archezoa‚ÄìMetakaryota divide. ‚Ä† No longer recognized by taxonomists. =Six kingdoms (1998)= In 1998, Cavalier-Smith published a six-kingdom model, which has been revised in subsequent papers. The version published in 2009 is shown below.Compared to the version Cavalier-Smith published in 2004, the alveolates and the rhizarians have been moved from Kingdom Protozoa to Kingdom Chromista. Cavalier-Smith no longer accepted the importance of the fundamental Eubacteria‚ÄìArchaebacteria divide put forward by Woese and others and supported by recent research. The kingdom Bacteria (sole kingdom of empire Prokaryota) was subdivided into two sub-kingdoms according to their membrane topologies: Unibacteria and Negibacteria. Unibacteria was divided into phyla Archaebacteria and Posibacteria; the bimembranous- unimembranous transition was thought to be far more fundamental than the long branch of genetic distance of Archaebacteria, viewed as having no particular biological significance. Cavalier-Smith does not accept the requirement for taxa to be monophyletic (\\"holophyletic\\" in his terminology) to be valid. He defines Prokaryota, Bacteria, Negibacteria, Unibacteria, and Posibacteria as valid paraphyla (therefore \\"monophyletic\\" in the sense he uses this term) taxa, marking important innovations of biological significance (in regard of the concept of biological niche). In the same way, his paraphyletic kingdom Protozoa includes the ancestors of Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Chromista. The advances of phylogenetic studies allowed Cavalier-Smith to realize that all the phyla thought to be archezoans (i.e. primitively amitochondriate eukaryotes) had in fact secondarily lost their mitochondria, typically by transforming them into new organelles: Hydrogenosomes. This means that all living eukaryotes are in fact metakaryotes, according to the significance of the term given by Cavalier-Smith. Some of the members of the defunct kingdom Archezoa, like the phylum Microsporidia, were reclassified into kingdom Fungi. Others were reclassified in kingdom Protozoa, like Metamonada which is now part of infrakingdom Excavata. Because Cavalier-Smith allows paraphyly, the diagram below is an ‚Äòorganization chart‚Äô, not an ‚Äòancestor chart‚Äô, and does not represent an evolutionary tree. =Seven kingdoms= Cavalier-Smith and his collaborators revised their classification in 2015. In this scheme they reintroduced the division of prokaryotes into two kingdoms, Bacteria (=Eubacteria) and Archaea (=Archaebacteria). This is based on the consensus in the Taxonomic Outline of Bacteria and Archaea (TOBA) and the Catalogue of Life. =Summary= The kingdom-level classification of life is still widely employed as a useful way of grouping organisms, notwithstanding some problems with this approach: * Kingdoms such as Protozoa represent grades rather than clades, and so are rejected by phylogenetic classification systems. * The most recent research does not support the classification of the eukaryotes into any of the standard systems. , no set of kingdoms is sufficiently supported by research to attain widespread acceptance. In 2009, Andrew Roger and Alastair Simpson emphasized the need for diligence in analyzing new discoveries: \\"With the current pace of change in our understanding of the eukaryote tree of life, we should proceed with caution.\\"  Beyond traditional kingdoms  While the concept of kingdoms continues to be used by some taxonomists, there has been a movement away from traditional kingdoms, as they are no longer seen as providing a cladistic classification, where there is emphasis in arranging organisms into natural groups. =Three domains of life= From around the mid-1970s onwards, there was an increasing emphasis on comparisons of genes at the molecular level (initially ribosomal RNA genes) as the primary factor in classification; genetic similarity was stressed over outward appearances and behavior. Taxonomic ranks, including kingdoms, were to be groups of organisms with a common ancestor, whether monophyletic (all descendants of a common ancestor) or paraphyletic (only some descendants of a common ancestor). Based on such RNA studies, Carl Woese thought life could be divided into three large divisions and referred to them as the \\"three primary kingdom\\" model or \\"urkingdom\\" model. In 1990, the name \\"domain\\" was proposed for the highest rank. This term represents a synonym for the category of dominion (lat. dominium), introduced by Moore in 1974. Unlike Moore, Woese et al. (1990) did not suggest a Latin term for this category, which represents a further argument supporting the accurately introduced term dominion. Woese divided the prokaryotes (previously classified as the Kingdom Monera) into two groups, called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, stressing that there was as much genetic difference between these two groups as between either of them and all eukaryotes. According to genetic data, although eukaryote groups such as plants, fungi, and animals may look different, they are more closely related to each other than they are to either the Eubacteria or Archaea. It was also found that the eukaryotes are more closely related to the Archaea than they are to the Eubacteria. Although the primacy of the Eubacteria-Archaea divide has been questioned, it has been upheld by subsequent research. There is no consensus on how many kingdoms exist in the classification scheme proposed by Woese. = Eukaryotic supergroups = Phylogenetic and symbiogenetic tree of living organisms, showing the origins of eukaryotes & prokaryotes One hypothesis of eukaryotic relationships, modified from Simpson and Roger (2004). In 2004, a review article by Simpson and Roger noted that the Protista were \\"a grab-bag for all eukaryotes that are not animals, plants or fungi\\". They held that only monophyletic groups should be accepted as formal ranks in a classification and that ‚Äì while this approach had been impractical previously (necessitating \\"literally dozens of eukaryotic 'kingdoms) ‚Äì it had now become possible to divide the eukaryotes into \\"just a few major groups that are probably all monophyletic\\". On this basis, the diagram opposite (redrawn from their article) showed the real \\"kingdoms\\" (their quotation marks) of the eukaryotes. A classification which followed this approach was produced in 2005 for the International Society of Protistologists, by a committee which \\"worked in collaboration with specialists from many societies\\". It divided the eukaryotes into the same six \\"supergroups\\". The published classification deliberately did not use formal taxonomic ranks, including that of \\"kingdom\\". In this system the multicellular animals (Metazoa) are descended from the same ancestor as both the unicellular choanoflagellates and the fungi which form the Opisthokonta. Plants are thought to be more distantly related to animals and fungi. However, in the same year as the International Society of Protistologists' classification was published (2005), doubts were being expressed as to whether some of these supergroups were monophyletic, particularly the Chromalveolata, and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the six proposed supergroups. , there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the SAR supergroup, so that Rhizaria is not one of the main eukaryote groups. Beyond this, there does not appear to be a consensus. Rogozin et al. in 2009 noted that \\"The deep phylogeny of eukaryotes is an extremely difficult and controversial problem.\\" , there appears to be a consensus that the six supergroup model proposed in 2005 does not reflect the true phylogeny of the eukaryotes and hence how they should be classified, although there is no agreement as to the model which should replace it. Viruses The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses uses the taxonomic rank \\"kingdom\\" for the classification of viruses (with the suffix -virae); but this is beneath the top level classifications of realm and subrealm. There is ongoing debate as to whether viruses can be included in the tree of life. The ten arguments against include the fact that they are obligate intracellular parasites that lack metabolism and are not capable of replication outside of a host cell. Another argument is that their placement in the tree would be problematic, since it is suspected that viruses have arisen multiple times, and they have a penchant for harvesting nucleotide sequences from their hosts. On the other hand, arguments favor their inclusion. One comes from the discovery of unusually large and complex viruses, such as Mimivirus, that possess typical cellular genes.

Heinlein. Originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in the July, August, and September 1941 issues, it was expanded into a full-length novel in 1958. The novel is usually considered to be part of Heinlein's Future History series of stories. It introduces the Howard families, a fictional group of people who achieved long lifespans through selective breeding. The space ship in this novel, the New Frontiers, is described in the Future History timeline as a second-generation ship, following the Vanguard, the vehicle for Heinlein's paired novellas \\"Universe\\" and \\"Common Sense\\". According to John W. Campbell, the novel was originally to be called While the Evil Days Come Not. The provisional title stems from a quotation from Ecclesiastes, which was used as a password on the second page of the story. The novel was the origin of the word \\"masquerade\\" as a term for a fictional trope of a hidden society within the real world. Plot summary Starting off a grocer, Ira Howard became rich as a sutler wholesaler during the American War of the Secession but died of old age at 48 or 49 years old. The trustees of his will carried out his wishes to prolong human life by financially encouraging those with long-lived grandparents to marry each other and have children. By the 22nd century, the \\"Howard families\\" have a life expectancy exceeding 150 years and keep their existence secret with the \\"Masquerade\\" in which the members fake their deaths and obtain new identities. The Masquerade helped the Families survive the dictatorship of Nehemiah Scudder, but as an experiment, some Howard members reveal themselves to The Covenant, hoping that the free society established after Scudder's defeat will be friendly. They are mistaken since others refuse to believe that the Families obtained their lifespan by selective breeding but insist that they have developed a secret method to extend life. Administrator Slayton Ford, leader of Earth, believes that the Families are telling the truth, but cannot prevent efforts to force Howard members to reveal their alleged rejuvenation abilities. Lazarus Long, the eldest member of the Families, proposes that the Families hijack the colony starship New Frontiers to escape Earth. Using an inertialess drive invented by Howard member Andrew Jackson \\"Slipstick\\" Libby, the Families leave the Solar System with the deposed Ford. The first planet they discover has humanoid inhabitants domesticated by indescribable godlike natives. When Earthly humans prove incapable of similar domestication, they are expelled from the planet. The second planet is a lush environment with no predators and mild weather. Its inhabitants are part of a group mind, with the mental ability to manipulate the environment on the genetic and molecular level but do not distinguish between individuals. That becomes evident when Mary Sperling, the second oldest of the Families, joins the group mind to become immortal. The Families are further horrified when the group mind genetically modifies the first baby born on the planet into a new, alien form. A majority of the Families returns to Earth to demand their freedom; Libby, with the help of the group mind, builds a new faster-than-light drive to take them home in months instead of years. The Families, returning to the Solar System 74 years after their original departure because of time dilation, discover that Earth's scientists have artificially extended human lifespan indefinitely by replicating what they believe is the Families' secret. The Howard members are now welcomed for their discovery of travel faster than light. Libby and Long decide to recruit other members of the Families and explore space with the new drive. Personal note Heinlein was a graduate of the Naval Academy, where he knew the family of Ernest J. King, later to be Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, and had dated one of his daughters and been the usher at the wedding of another. King, who was known throughout his life for his irascibility, took command of the aircraft carrier Lexington in 1930. Ensign Heinlein was assigned to the ship and served under King for the next year and a half and interacted with him frequently.Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century: Volume 1: 1907-1948, Learning Curve, William H. Patterson, Jr., Tor, New York, pages 126‚Äî143 In Methuselah's Children, after the Families have taken over the starship, they appoint a Family member, Rufus (\\"Ruthless\\") King, to be its commander. Critical reception Alva Rogers, in A Requiem for Astounding, wrote that Methuselah's Children was \\"Full of adventure, conflict, romance, and enough casually tossed-off ideas to serve as the basis for a half-dozen other stories.\\" In Heinlein in Dimension, Alexei Panshin wrote, \\"In many ways this is an important book. For one, its main theme, the problem of escaping death, is one that keeps cropping up in Heinlein stories, and for another, an amazing number of brilliant ideas are tossed out along the way.\\" Floyd C. Gale called the book \\"a classic\\". Reappearance of characters in other Heinlein novels Lazarus Long first appears in this novel. Other Heinlein novels featuring him include Time Enough for Love, The Number of the Beast, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls and To Sail Beyond the Sunset. Andrew \\"Slipstick\\" Libby, previously seen as a young adult in the short story \\"Misfit\\", also features prominently in this novel. In Time Enough for Love, Libby is said to have become Lazarus Long's partner in space travel until his death.

A strategy game or strategic game is a game (e.g. a board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous, decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal decision tree-style thinking, and typically very high situational awareness. History The history of turn-based strategy games goes back to the times of ancient civilizations found in places such as Rome, Greece, Egypt, the Levant, and India. Many were played widely through their regions of origin, but only some are still played today. One such game is mancala, which may have originated in Samaria approximately 5000 years ago and has since diversified into scores of varieties worldwide. One form challenges two opposing players to clear their side of a board of mancala pieces while adding them into their opponent's side and thereby preventing the opponent from clearing their side. At each end of the game board in this version there is a larger pit in which each player must try to deposit the pieces to try and gain points. When one side is cleared the other side of the board's pieces are added to the cleared side's pile. This version of mancala can be played quite casually, but still presents strategy demands, e.g. to interfere in your opponent's playing area while clearing your own. Another game that has stood the test of time is chess, believed to have originated in India around the sixth century CE. The game spread to the west by trade, but chess gained social status and permanence more strongly than many other games. Chess became a game of skill and tactics often forcing the players to think two or three moves ahead of their opponent just to keep up. This game also became accepted by many as a proxy for intelligence; people who became grand masters were considered smart. The game portrays foot soldiers, knights, kings, queens, bishops, and rooks. Several portray actual positions in the historical European military. Each piece has a unique movement pattern. For example, the knight is constricted to moving in a L-shape two squares long and one square to the side, the rook can only move in a straight line vertically or horizontally, and bishops can move diagonally on the board. Types =Abstract strategy= In abstract strategy games, the game is only loosely tied to a thematic concept, if at all. The rules do not attempt to simulate reality, but rather serve the internal logic of the game. A purist's definition of an abstract strategy game requires that it cannot have random elements or hidden information. This definition includes such games as chess, Go and Arimaa (a game with multiple moves within a turn). However, many games are commonly classed as abstract strategy games which do not meet these criteria: games such as backgammon, Octiles, Can't Stop, Sequence and Mentalis have all been described as \\"abstract strategy\\" games despite having a chance element. A smaller category of non-perfect abstract strategy games incorporate hidden information without using any random elements; for example, Stratego. =Team strategy= One of the most focused team strategy games is contract bridge. This card game consists of two teams of two players, whose offensive and defensive skills are continually in flux as the game's dynamic progresses. Some argue that the benefits of playing this team strategy card game extend to those skills and strategies used in business\\"How to automate strategic & tactical thinking and that the playing of these games helps to automate strategic awareness. =Eurogames= Eurogames, or German-style boardgames, are a relatively new genre that sit between abstract strategy games and simulation games. They generally have simple rules, short to medium playing times, indirect player interaction and abstract physical components. The games emphasize strategy, play down chance and conflict, lean towards economic rather than military themes, and usually keep all the players in the game until it ends. =Simulation= This type of game is an attempt to simulate the decisions and processes inherent to some real-world situation. Most of the rules are chosen to reflect what the real-world consequences would be of each player's actions and decisions. Abstract games cannot be completely divided from simulations and so games can be thought of as existing on a continuum of almost pure abstraction (like Abalone) to almost pure simulation (like Diceball! or Strat-o-Matic Baseball). =Wargame= German military wargame from 1824 Wargames are simulations of military battles, campaigns or entire wars. Players will have to consider situations that are analogous to the situations faced by leaders of historical battles. As such, wargames are usually heavy on simulation elements, and while they are all \\"strategy games\\", they can also be \\"strategic\\" or \\"tactical\\" in the military jargon sense. Its creator, H. G. Wells, stated how \\"much better is this amiable miniature [war] than the real thing\\". Traditionally, wargames have been played either with miniatures, using physical models of detailed terrain and miniature representations of people and equipment to depict the game state; or on a board, which commonly uses cardboard counters on a hex map. Popular miniature wargames include Warhammer 40,000 or its fantasy counterpart Warhammer Fantasy. Popular strategic board wargames include Risk, Axis and Allies, Diplomacy, and Paths of Glory. Advanced Squad Leader is a successful tactical scale wargame. =Strategy video games= Strategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of real-time strategy (RTS), or the discrete phases of turn-based strategy (TBS). Often the computer is expected to emulate a strategically thinking \\"side\\" similar to that of a human player (such as directing armies and constructing buildings), or emulate the \\"instinctive\\" actions of individual units that would be too tedious for a player to administer (such as for a peasant to run away when attacked, as opposed to standing still until otherwise ordered by the player); hence there is an emphasis on artificial intelligence. Modern day turn-based One of today's modern games that has become a sensation for its strategy and tactics is the XCOM franchise, specifically the two most recent games, XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012) and XCOM 2 (2016). These two games portray the player as a commander of an international organization known as XCOM. The player's job is to repel an alien force using the recourses that you are given by each region and country that is a part of the organization. The game is played through confrontations with the alien force using a squad of four to six soldiers with periods of time in between where the player is able to even the odds placed against them by upgrading weapons and armor for the soldiers using technology that is recovered from the aliens. These upgrades result in boosted health as well as laser- and plasma-based weapons and are necessary to achieve if the player wishes to complete the game. Like chess the games have different classes of soldiers with different abilities which can turn the tide of the game if you use them correctly or not. They come in six classes for each game. In XCOM: Enemy Unknown the soldier classes consist of heavy, capable of dealing heavy damage and carrying rockets as well as grenades; the sniper, capable of hitting enemies from beyond line of sight and doing immense amounts of damage with a single shot; the support, can heal teammates and provide cover using smoke; the assault, which relies on getting up close in order to use the shotgun that they use to make short work of any enemy; the Psionic, this class specializes in applying status effects and generally messing with the opponent's force; and finally the MEC, this used to be a fully organic being but volunteered to replace their organic body with robotic augments, this gives them massive amounts of health and makes them the tanks of the game on the protagonists side. Another aspect of turn-based strategy rather than just a battlefield in modern video games is controlling countries such as in the Civilization franchise and their most recent title, Civilization VI. This strategy game forces the player to look at the world as a whole as there are multiple countries involved in the game that will react to the player and their actions and how they influence the world. The player must maintain relations with other nations as they try to progress their society forward by the inclusion of funding to sections of their society such as mathematics, art, science, and agriculture. Each of these is important to maintain as the player progresses because without the added funds to these branches of society most players will be stuck in the Dark Ages while other civilizations advance into renaissance eras and further. This can cause turmoil in the player's civilization as well as revolt and will bring the civilization crumbling to the ground. This is only a small portion of the game, the other nations around the player will offer treaties and alliances but some of these are shams and are used to lure the player into a false sense of security as an allied nation begins to take over resources or land that used to belong to the player. In these situations it becomes tricky to navigate as there are two paths, negotiation or war. Negotiations are often the best choice because it avoids conflict and allows your society to progress further whereas war takes a considerable amount of resources and the player must also be aware of the actual allies that the opposing force has and how much aid they will provide. Unfortunately negotiations are not always possible and it can result in war, this makes it very important to have loyal allies of your own and a suitable army with sufficient technologies which is all supported by your societies math and science departments respectively.

It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad-tipped instrument, brush, or other writing instrument. A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as \\"the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner\\". Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable. Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand- lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both. CD-ROM Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of wedding invitations and event invitations, font design and typography, original hand-lettered logo design, religious art, announcements, graphic design and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone inscriptions, and memorial documents. It is also used for props and moving images for film and television, and also for testimonials, birth and death certificates, maps, and other written works. Tools nib, with part names The principal tools for a calligrapher are the pen and the brush. Calligraphy pens write with nibs that may be flat, round, or pointed. For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens‚Äîsteel brushes‚Äîcan be used. However, works have also been created with felt-tip and ballpoint pens, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen. Writing ink is usually water- based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. Certain specialty paper with high ink absorption and constant texture enables cleaner lines, although parchment or vellum is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a light-box is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with litterea unciales (hence the name), and college-ruled paper often acts as a guideline well. Common calligraphy pens and brushes are: * Quill * Dip pen * Ink brush * Qalam * Fountain pen World traditions =East Asia and Vietnam= Chinese calligraphy is locally called ' or ' ( or in Traditional Chinese, literally \\"the method or law of writing\\"); (Taiwanese) being here used as in (Cantonese) or (Taiwanese), meaning \\"writing style\\", Japanese calligraphy is ' (, literally \\"the way or principle of writing\\"); Korean calligraphy is called ' (/, literally \\"the art of writing\\"); and Vietnamese calligraphy is called thu phap (Vietnamese: Th∆∞ ph√°p/Êõ∏Ê≥ï, literally \\"the way of letters or words\\"). The calligraphy of East Asian characters is an important and appreciated aspect of traditional East Asian culture. History In ancient China, the oldest Chinese characters existing are Ji«ég«îw√©n characters (Áî≤È™®Êñá) carved on ox scapulae and tortoise plastrons, because the dominators in Shang Dynasty carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978).

In Imperial China, the graphs on old steles‚Äîsome dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style‚Äîare still accessible. About 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them Li Si's character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ' characters. Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

Its spread was encouraged by Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang (926‚Äì933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China. But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of which is not absolutely the same in the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.. See, for example, the radicals , , or . The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on p. 41, clearly allow the stroke order to be determined. Styles which did not survive include BƒÅfƒìnsh≈´, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%. Some variant Chinese characters were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the Simplified Chinese character set. Technique On Calligraphy by Mi Fu, Song Dynasty Traditional East Asian writing uses the Four Treasures of the Study (/):Li, J. (Ed.). (n.d.). \\"Four treasures of Study\\" tour. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/anhui/travel/2010-06/02/content_9948922.htm ink brushes known as m√°ob«ê (/) to write Chinese characters, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstones. These instruments of writing are also known as the Four Friends of the Study () in Korea. Besides the traditional four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used. Many different parameters influence the final result of a calligrapher's work. Physical parameters include the shape, size, stretch, and hair type of the ink brush; the color, color density and water density of the ink; as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result, as the look of finished characters are influenced by the quantity of ink and water the calligraper lets the brush take and by the pressure, inclination, and direction of the brush. Changing these variables produces thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations and decelerations of a skilled calligrapher's movements aim to give \\"spirit\\" to the characters, greatly influencing their final shapes. Styles Cursive styles such as ' (/)(semi-cursive or running script) and ' (/)(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script (Han Dynasty), but ' and ' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The ' style was highly appreciated in Emperor Wu of Han reign (140‚Äì187 AD). Examples of modern printed styles are Song from the Song Dynasty's printing press, and sans-serif. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written. Influences Japanese calligraphy: the word \\"peace\\" and the signature of the Meiji-period calligrapher ≈åura Kanetake, 1910 Both Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, Japanese calligraphy go out of the set of CJK strokes to also include local alphabets such as hiragana and katakana, with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials (Japanese paper, ' , and Japanese ink). In the case of Korean calligraphy, the Hangeul and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers. Vietnamese calligraphy is quite special, since Vietnam has abolished the Ch·ªØ N√¥m, an old Vietnamese writing system based on Chinese characters and replaced it with the Latin alphabet. However, the calligraphic traditions continue to be preserved. Temporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and limestone carved stamps. Since late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling Chinese characters with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are Xu Bing's square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy. Calligraphy has influenced ink and wash painting, which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in East Asia, including ink and wash painting, a style of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean based entirely on calligraphy. Mongolia Mongolian calligraphy is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style. Tibet A B√∂n text Tibetan calligraphy is central to Tibetan culture. The script is derived from Indic scripts. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High Lamas and inhabitants of the Potala Palace, were usually capable calligraphers. Tibet has been a center of Buddhism for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of secular pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the Dalai Lama and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their prayer wheels, although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well. =Ethiopia/Abyssinia= A painting of Susenyos I (r. 1607‚Äì1632) on a Ge'ez prayer scroll meant to dispel evil spirits, Wellcome Collection, London Ethiopian (Abyssinian) calligraphy began with the Ge'ez script, which replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum, that was developed specifically for Ethiopian Semitic languages. In those languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called ', which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since D ømt. Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of Ezana of Axum. The Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia. =Europe= History Folio 27r from the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.700) contains the incipit from the Gospel of Matthew. British Library, London. Western calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the Latin script. The Latin alphabet appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century developed into Roman imperial capitals carved on stones, Rustic capitals painted on walls, and Roman cursive for daily use. In the second and third centuries the uncial lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the Dark Ages. At the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The Semi-uncial generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo- Saxon.Insular Manuscripts: Paleography Section 6: Language on the Page in Insular Manuscripts Layout and Legibility. (n.d.).

Calligraphy in a Latin Bible of 1407 on display in Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire, England. This Bible was hand-written in Belgium, by Gerard Brils, for reading aloud in a monastery. Christian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the Breviary, and other sacred texts.de Hamel 2001a Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin \\"uncia\\", or \\"inch\\") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands.Knight 1998: 10 The 7th‚Äì9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells.Trinity College Library Dublin 2006; Walther & Wolf 2005; Brown & Lovett 1999: 40; Backhouse 1981 Charlemagne's devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of \\"a crowd of scribes\\", according to Alcuin, the Abbot of York.Jackson 1981: 64 Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or Carolingian minuscule. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)‚Äîa Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc.Walther & Wolf 2005; de Hamel 1994: 46‚Äì48 Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.de Hamel 1994: 46 In the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the Gothic script, which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page. The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when Johannes Gutenberg developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first typeface. The Georgian calligraphy is centuries-old tradition of an artistic writing of the Georgian language with its three scripts. In the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the humanist minuscule or littera antiqua. The 17th century saw the Batarde script from France, and the 18th century saw the English script spread across Europe and world through their books. In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher. The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as Round hand in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the Bastarda. While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published Les Ecritures Financi√®re Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel circa 1650. With the destruction of the Camera Apostolica during the sack of Rome (1527), the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France. By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery Circumflessa, which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English Roundhand. In England, Ayres and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned. Style Modern Western calligraphy Sacred Western calligraphy has some unique features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative \\"carpet page\\" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The Lindisfarne Gospels (715‚Äì720 AD) are an early example. As with Chinese or Islamic calligraphy, Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a \\"geometrical\\" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise stroke order. Unlike a typeface, irregularity in the characters' size, style, and colors increases aesthetic value, though the content may be illegible. Many of the themes and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy are found in the pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface. Influences Several other Western styles use the same tools and practices, but differ by character set and stylistic preferences. For Slavonic lettering, the history of the Slavonic and consequently Russian writing systems differs fundamentally from the one of the Latin language. It evolved from the 10th century to today. =Islamic world= Bismillah in an 18th- century Islamic calligraphy from the Ottoman region. Islamic calligraphy (calligraphy in Arabic is ' ) has evolved alongside Islam and the Arabic language. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it \\"Arabic calligraphy\\". However the term \\"Islamic calligraphy\\" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by Muslim calligraphers of different national cultures, like Persian or Ottoman calligraphy, from Al-Andalus in medieval Spain to China. Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art (arabesque) on the walls and ceilings of mosques as well as on the page or other materials. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world may draw on the heritage of calligraphy to create modern calligraphic inscriptions, like corporate logos, or abstractions. Instead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for Muslims is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the spiritual world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The Qur'an has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy. During the Ottoman civilization, Islamic calligraphy attained special prominence. The city of Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. =Mayan civilization= Mayan calligraphy was expressed via Mayan hieroglyphs; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on seals and monuments in the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in Campeche, Yucat√°n and Quintana Roo, calligraphy in Mayan languages is written in Latin script rather than hieroglyphs. Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups. Most of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as Chichen Itza, Labna, Uxmal, Edzna, Calakmul, etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as stele are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy. =Persia= Bowl with Kufic Calligraphy, 10th century. Brooklyn Museum. Example showing Nastaliq's proportional rules Persian calligraphy has been present in the Persian region before Islamisation. In Zoroastrianism, beautiful and clear writings were always praised. It is believed that ancient Persian script was invented by about 600‚Äì500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the Achaemenid kings. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called \\"script of nails/cuneiform script\\" (') in Persian. Centuries later, other scripts such as \\"Pahlavi\\" and \\"Avestan\\" scripts were used in ancient Persia.  Contemporary scripts  The Nasta'liq style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the \\"bride of calligraphy scripts\\". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. Mir Ali Tabrizi had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece. =South Asia= India On the subject of Indian calligraphy, writes:.

The script itself, along with its derivatives (like Lantsa, Phagpa, Kutila) are used in Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Leh, Mongolia, coastal Japan, and Korea to write \\"Om mani padme hum\\" and other sacred Buddhist texts, mainly those derived from Sanskrit and Pali. =Southeast Asia= Philippines Tagbanwa calligraphy An illuminated baybayin chart in stylish version The Philippines has numerous ancient and indigenous scripts collectively called as Suyat scripts. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are Hanun√≥'o/Hanunoo of the Hanuno'o Mangyan people, Buhid/Buid of the Buhid Mangyan people, Tagbanwa script of the Tagbanwa people, and Palaw'an/Pala'wan of the Palaw'an people. All four scripts were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme, under the name Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala‚Äôwan), in 1999. Hanun√≥'o calligraphy Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the Kulitan script of the Kapampangan people, the badlit script of various Visayan ethnic groups, the Iniskaya script of the Eskaya people, the Baybayin script of the Tagalog people, and the Kur-itan script of the Ilocano people, among many others. Due to the diversity of suyat scripts, all calligraphy written in suyat scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other. Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy. Vietnam A page from The Tale of Kieu by Nguy·ªÖn Du. 19th century. Vietnamese calligraphy, or (, literally \\"the way of letters or words\\"), uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Ch·ªØ n√¥m, and the Latin-based Qu·ªëc Ng·ªØ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Qu·ªëc Ng·ªØ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographical reasons. Being part of the Chinese sphere of influence, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy‚Äôs standard and use Han character scripts in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Qu·ªëc Ng·ªØ script, as Ch·ªØ n√¥m and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use. Modern calligraphy =Revival= Edward Johnston, founder of modern western calligraphy, at work in 1902 After printing became ubiquitous from the 15th century onward, the production of illuminated manuscripts began to decline.de Hamel 2001a; de Hamel 1986 However, the rise of printing did not mean the end of calligraphy.Zapf 2007; de Hamel 2001a; Gilderdale 1999; Gray 1971 The modern revival of calligraphy began at the end of the 19th century, influenced by the aesthetics and philosophy of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. Edward Johnston is regarded as being the father of modern calligraphy.Cockerell 1945; Morris 1882 After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect William Harrison Cowlishaw, he was introduced to William Lethaby in 1898, principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, who advised him to study manuscripts at the British Museum.such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904 This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad-edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in Southampton Row, London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor Eric Gill. He was commissioned by Frank Pick to design a new typeface for London Underground, still used today (with minor modifications).The Eric Gill Society: Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston He has been credited for reviving the art of modern penmanship and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings ‚Äì his handbook on the subject, Writing & Illuminating, & Lettering (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including Graily Hewitt, Stanley Morison, Eric Gill, Alfred Fairbank and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the Foundational hand. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.Gilderdale 1999 He first referred to this hand as \\"Foundational Hand\\" in his 1909 publication, Manuscript & Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen.Baines & Dixon 2003: 81 =Subsequent developments= Graily Hewitt taught at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of gilding in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the revival of gilding with gesso and gold leaf on vellum. Hewitt helped to found the Society of Scribes & Illuminators (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society. An example of Graily Hewitt's calligraphy Hewitt is not without both criticsTresser 2006 and supportersWhitley 2000: 90 in his rendering of Cennino Cennini's medieval gesso recipes.Herringham 1899 Donald Jackson, a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.Jackson 1981: 81 Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to Prince Philip of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.Hewitt 1944-1953 Johnston‚Äôs pupil, Anna Simons, was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering in 1910. Austrian Rudolf Larisch, a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles. Rudolf Koch was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably Karlgeorg Hoefer, and Hermann Zapf.Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991 Contemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to professional design software packages like Adobe InDesign, owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.

Water is pumped by turning a screw-shaped surface inside a pipe. Archimedes screws are also used for materials such as powders and grains. Although commonly attributed to Archimedes, there is some evidence that the device had been used in Ancient Egypt long before his time. History The screw pump is the oldest positive displacement pump. The first records of a water screw, or screw pump, date back to Hellenistic Egypt before the 3rd century BC. The Egyptian screw, used to lift water from the Nile, was composed of tubes wound round a cylinder; as the entire unit rotates, water is lifted within the spiral tube to the higher elevation. A later screw pump design from Egypt had a spiral groove cut on the outside of a solid wooden cylinder and then the cylinder was covered by boards or sheets of metal closely covering the surfaces between the grooves. Some researchers have postulated this as being the device used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. A cuneiform inscription of Assyrian King Sennacherib (704‚Äì681 BC) has been interpreted by Stephanie DalleyStephanie Dalley, The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced, (2013), OUP to describe casting water screws in bronze some 350 years earlier. This is consistent with classical author Strabo, who describes the Hanging Gardens as irrigated by screws. The screw pump was later introduced from Egypt to Greece. It was described by Archimedes, on the occasion of his visit to Egypt, circa 234 BC. This tradition may reflect only that the apparatus was unknown to the Greeks before Hellenistic times. Archimedes never claimed credit for its invention, but it was attributed to him 200 years later by Diodorus, who believed that Archimedes invented the screw pump in Egypt. Depictions of Greek and Roman water screws show them being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece, which would require that the casing be rigidly attached to the screw. German engineer Konrad Kyeser equipped the Archimedes screw with a crank mechanism in his Bellifortis (1405). This mechanism quickly replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading.  Design  The Archimedes screw consists of a screw (a helical surface surrounding a central cylindrical shaft) inside a hollow pipe. The screw is usually turned by windmill, manual labor, cattle, or by modern means, such as a motor. As the shaft turns, the bottom end scoops up a volume of water. This water is then pushed up the tube by the rotating helicoid until it pours out from the top of the tube. The contact surface between the screw and the pipe does not need to be perfectly watertight, as long as the amount of water being scooped with each turn is large compared to the amount of water leaking out of each section of the screw per turn. If water from one section leaks into the next lower one, it will be transferred upwards by the next segment of the screw. In some designs, the screw is fused to the casing and they both rotate together, instead of the screw turning within a stationary casing. The screw could be sealed to the casing with pitch resin or other adhesive, or the screw and casing could be cast together as a single piece in bronze. > The design of the everyday Greek and Roman water screw, in contrast to the > heavy bronze device of Sennacherib, with its problematic drive chains, has a > powerful simplicity. A double or triple helix was built of wood strips (or > occasionally bronze sheeting) around a heavy wooden pole. A cylinder was > built around the helices using long, narrow boards fastened to their > periphery and waterproofed with pitch.  Uses  The screw was used predominantly for the transport of water to irrigation systems and for dewatering mines or other low-lying areas. It was used for draining land that was underneath the sea in the Netherlands and other places in the creation of polders. Archimedes screws are used in sewage treatment plants because they cope well with varying rates of flow and with suspended solids. An auger in a snow blower or grain elevator is essentially an Archimedes screw. Many forms of axial flow pump basically contain an Archimedes screw. The principle is also found in pescalators, which are Archimedes screws designed to lift fish safely from ponds and transport them to another location. This technology is used primarily at fish hatcheries, where it is desirable to minimize the physical handling of fish. An Archimedes screw was used in the successful 2001 stabilization of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Small amounts of subsoil saturated by groundwater were removed from far below the north side of the tower, and the weight of the tower itself corrected the lean.(counterweights were also used. The angle of lean was too high for it to simply correct lean on its own) Archimedes screws are also used in chocolate fountains. Archimedes Screws Turbines (ASTs) are a new form of generators for small hydroelectric powerplants that could be applied even in low head sites. The low rotation speed of ASTs reduces negative impacts on aquatic life and fish.  Variants  An Archimedes screw seen on a combine harvester A screw conveyor is an Archimedes screw contained within a tube and turned by a motor so as to deliver material from one end of the conveyor to the other. It is particularly suitable for transport of granular materials such as plastic granules used in injection moulding, and cereal grains. It may also be used to transport liquids. In industrial control applications the conveyor may be used as a rotary feeder or variable rate feeder to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process. A variant of the Archimedes screw can also be found in some injection moulding machines, die casting machines and extrusion of plastics, which employ a screw of decreasing pitch to compress and melt the material. It is also used in a rotary-screw air compressor. On a much larger scale, Archimedes's screws of decreasing pitch are used for the compaction of waste material. =Reverse action= If water is fed into the top of an Archimedes screw, it will force the screw to rotate. The rotating shaft can then be used to drive an electric generator. Such an installation has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: the ability to handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow at high efficiency. Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro are two reverse screw micro hydro schemes operating in England. The screw works well as a generator at low heads, commonly found in English rivers, including the Thames, powering Windsor Castle.BBC. \\"Windsor Castle water turbine installed on River Thames\\" bbc.com, 20 September 2011. Retrieved: 19 October 2017. In 2017, the first reverse screw hydropower in the United States opened in Meriden, Connecticut. The Meriden project was built and is operated by New England Hydropower having a nameplate capacity of 193 kW and a capacity factor of approximately 55% over a 5-year running period.

The value is the average of three statistics: basic literacy rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy at age one, all equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale. It was developed for the Overseas Development Council in the mid-1970s by Morris David Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of GNP as an indicator of development. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. It has also been criticized because there is considerable overlap between infant mortality and life expectancy. The UN Human Development Index is a more widely used means of measuring well-being. Steps to Calculate Physical Quality of Life: 1) Find percentage of the population that is literate (literacy rate). 2) Find the infant mortality rate. (out of 1000 births) INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate = (166 - infant mortality) √ó 0.625 3) Find the Life Expectancy. INDEXED Life Expectancy = (Life expectancy - 42) √ó 2.7 4) Physical Quality of Life = (Literacy Rate + INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate + INDEXED Life Expectancy) _ 3 :- ABOUT PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX= PQLI : Increase in national income and per capita income are not the real indicators of economic development, as it has a number of limitations. Increasing incomes of the country are concentrated in the hands of a few people, which is not development. The development of a country should be such that the living standards of the poor rise, and the basic requirements of the citizens are fulfilled. Keeping this in mind, Morris Davis Morris presented the physical quality of life index, in short known as the PQLI. In this index, betterment of physical quality of life of human beings is considered economic development. The level of physical quality of life determines the level of economic development. If any country's physical quality of life is higher than that of the other country, then that country is considered as more developed. There are three standards to measure the physical quality, which are depicted here: 1)- Extent of Education, 2)- Life Expectancy & 3)- Infant Mortality Rate See also * Basic Well-being Index (BWI) * Human Poverty Index * Quality-of-life Index, a different index calculated in 2005 * Quality of well-being scale * Gross National Happiness * Bhutan GNH Index * Happiness economics References Quality of life ","title":"Physical Quality of Life Index"},{"id":"53692","text":"Payola, in the music industry, is the illegal practice of payment to commercial radio in which the song is presented as being part of the normal day's broadcast, without announcing that there has been consideration paid in cash or in kind for its airplay adjacent to the recording's broadcast. Under US law, a radio station can play a specific song in exchange for money, but this must be disclosed on the air as being sponsored airtime. The term has come to refer to any undisclosed payment made to cast a product in a favorable light (such as obtaining positive reviews). Some radio stations report spins of the newest and most popular songs to industry publications. The number of times the songs are played can influence the perceived popularity of a song. The term payola is a combination of \\"pay\\" and \\"ola\\", a common suffix of product names in the early 20th century, such as Pianola, Victrola, Amberola, Crayola, Rock-Ola, Shinola, or brands such as the radio equipment manufacturer Motorola. Payola has come to mean the payment of a bribe in commerce and in law to say or do a certain thing against the rules of law, but more specifically a commercial bribe. The FCC defines \\"payola\\" as a violation of the sponsorship identification rule.  History  In earlier eras, there was not much public scrutiny of the reasons songs became hits. The ad agencies which had sponsored NBC's radio/TV show Your Hit Parade for 20 years refused to reveal the specific methods that were used to determine top hits, only stating generally that they were based on \\"readings of radio requests, sheet music sales, dance hall favorites and jukebox tabulations\\". Only a general statement that hit status was based on \\"readings of radio requests, sheet music sales, dance hall favorites and jukebox tabulations\\" Attempts to create a code to stop payola were met with mainly lukewarm silence by publishers. Prosecution for payola in the 1950s was in part a reaction of the traditional music establishment against newcomers. Hit radio was a threat to the wages of song-pluggers. Radio hits also threatened old revenue streams; for example, by the middle of the 1940s, three-quarters of the records produced in the USA went into jukeboxes. Still, in the 1950s, independent record companies or music publishers frequently used payola to promote rock and roll on American radio; it promoted cultural diversity and disc jockeys were less inclined to indulge their own personal and racial biases. Alan Freed, a disc jockey and early supporter of rock and roll (and also widely credited for actually coining the term), had his career and reputation greatly harmed by a payola scandal. Dick Clark's early career was nearly derailed by a payola scandal, but he avoided trouble by selling his stake in a record company and cooperating with authorities.\\"The Jordan brothers: A Musical Biography of Rock's Fortunate Sons\\", by Maxim W. Furek. Kimberley Press, 1986. Attempts were made to link all payola with rock and roll music. \\"Even now after the payola scandals and the attempt to link all payola with rock and roll recordings, the music with a beat still dominates over 60 percent of The Billboard's Hot 100 chart. This isn't to say that rock and roll isn't fading, or actually evolving into pop music, but .... \\" In 1976, inner- city urban soul DJ Frankie Crocker was indicted in a payola scandal, causing him to leave NY radio, where his influence was greatest. The charges were later dropped and he returned to NY, hosting MTV's video jukebox. The amount of money involved is largely unpublished; however, one DJ, Phil Lind of Chicago's WAIT, disclosed in Congressional hearings that he had taken $22,000 to play a record.Richard Campbell et al, Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication, 2004 The issue was featured in a 1978 episode of WKRP in Cincinnati, where Johnny Fever's morning show replacement (when Johnny left to take a new job in Los Angeles) was caught taking cocaine as a bribe to play certain records from a label with which he was associated. =Congressional payola investigations= The Congressional Payola Investigations occurred in 1959, after the United States Senate began investigating the payola scandal. Among those thought to have been involved were DJ Alan Freed and television personality Dick Clark. The term Congressional Payola Investigations refers to investigations by the House Subcommittee on Legislative Oversight into payola, the practice of record promoters paying DJs or radio programmers to play their labels' songs. Payola can refer to monetary rewards or other types of reimbursement, and is a tool record labels use to promote certain artists. Other forms of payola include making arrangements to purchase certain amounts of advertising in exchange for staying on a station's playlist, forcing bands to play station-sponsored concerts for little or no money in order to stay in a station's good graces, and paying for stations to hold \\"meet the band\\" contests, in exchange for air time for one of the label's newer, lesser-known bands. The first major payola investigation occurred in the early 1960s. DJ Alan Freed, who was uncooperative in committee hearings, was fired as a result. Dick Clark also testified before the committee, but survived, partially due to the fact that he had divested himself of ownership interest in all of his music-industry holdings. After the initial investigation, radio DJs were stripped of the authority to make programming decisions, and payola became a misdemeanor offense. Programming decisions became the responsibility of station program directors. As a result, the process of persuading stations to play certain songs was simplified. Instead of reaching numerous DJs, record labels only had to connect with one station program director. Labels turned to independent promoters to circumvent allegations of payola. This practice grew more and more widespread until a 1986 NBC News investigation called \\"The New Payola\\" instigated another round of Congressional investigations. With the creation of Napster and other now illegal music sharing websites, the power of the independent promoters began to decline. Labels once more began dealing with stations directly. In 2002, investigations by the office of then-New York District Attorney Eliot Spitzer uncovered evidence that executives at Sony BMG music labels had made deals with several large commercial radio chains. In July 2005, the company acknowledged their improper promotional practices and agreed to pay a $10 million fine. Modus operandi =Third-party loophole= A different form of payola has been used by the record industry through the loophole of being able to pay a third party or independent record promoters (\\"indies\\"; not to be confused with independent record labels), who will then go and \\"promote\\" those songs to radio stations. Offering the radio stations \\"promotion payments\\", the independents get the songs that their clients, record companies, want on the playlists of radio stations around the country. This newer type of payola was an attempt to sidestep FCC regulations.Rachel M. Stilwell, \\"Which Public - Whose Interest - How the FCC's Deregulation of Radio Station Ownership Has Harmed the Public Interest, and How We Can Escape from the Swamp,\\" 26 Loy. L.A. Ent. L. Rev. 369, 419-428, March 1, 2006 Since the independent intermediaries were the ones actually paying the stations, it was thought that their inducements did not fall under the \\"payola\\" rules, so a radio station need not report them as paid promotions. Former New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer prosecuted payola-related crimes in his jurisdiction. His office settled out of court with Sony BMG Music Entertainment in July 2005, Warner Music Group in November 2005 and Universal Music Group in May 2006. The three conglomerates agreed to pay $10 million, $5 million, and $12 million respectively to New York State non-profit organizations that will fund music education and appreciation programs. EMI remains under investigation. Concern about contemporary forms of payola prompted an investigation during which the FCC established firmly that the \\"loophole\\" was still a violation of the law. In 2007, four companies (CBS Radio, Citadel, Clear Channel, and Entercom) settled on paying $12.5 million in fines and accepting tougher restrictions than the legal requirements for three years, although no company admitted any wrongdoing. Because of the increased legal scrutiny, some larger radio companies (including industry giant Clear Channel) now flatly refuse to have any contact with independent promoters. Clear Channel Radio through iHeartRadio launched a program called On the Verge that required the stations to play a given song at least 150 times in order to give a new artist exposure. Brand managers at the top of the Clear Channel chain, after listening to hundreds of songs and filtering them down to about five or six favorites from various formats, send those selections to program directors across the country. These program directors vote on which ones they think radio listeners will like the most. One of the songs that benefited with the exposure was Iggy Azalea's \\"Fancy\\". Tinashe's \\"2 On\\", Anthony Lewis' \\"Candy Rain\\", and Jhen√© Aiko's \\"The Worst\\", among others, have been featured on the program, however, those failed to duplicate Azalea's chart hit. Tom Poleman, president of national programming platforms for the company, stated that the acts selected are based solely on the quality of their music and not on label pressure. On Spotify, labels can pay for tracks to appear in user play-lists as \\"Sponsored Songs\\". It is possible to opt out of it using a setting. =As money laundering scheme= In Mexico, South America and some regions of the U.S. southern border, it is common to hear the sudden appearance of \\"new artists\\", mainly in folk radio stations, who are not known in the music industry, have no previous career and with no explanation of where they come from. These music groups and singers start to appear consistently on radio, television and public broadcasts with a strong promotion of their concerts. This happens for a fixed amount of time, and in the same sudden way they appear, they stop their promotion and disappear from the music scene, or change their stage name. Such artists are commonly manufactured by producers of dubious origin, who pay payola and do events in order to launder money from drug trafficking, prostitution or other illegal operations. Criticism The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Communications Act of 1934 both have strict requirements and rules regarding the issue of payola. Both the FCC and the Act demand that \\"employees of broadcast stations, program producers, program suppliers and others who, in exchange for airing material, have accepted or agreed to receive payments, services or other valuable consideration must disclose this fact. Disclosure of compensation provides broadcasters the information they need to let their audiences know if material was paid for, and by whom.\\" But even with these requirements in place, big-time record companies have found loopholes to continue the practice legally. The reason why record companies have managed to find relatively big loopholes in an otherwise complex and strict document is because of the wording. According to the current regulations in place, it is still considered legal to pay to play a particular song on the radio. The only hitch is that the broadcaster has to reveal who paid. In addition, the disclosures must be from DJ to station manager to program director and upwards. The loose wording has created a loophole that makes it easier for wealthy record company officials to pay the DJs large sums of money to play certain songs a certain number of times at a given time during the day. The loophole has created a \\"grey market, one in which shady, quasi-legal deals take place, and independent artists lose out more often than not.\\" The loophole has made it sure that independent artists will be isolated from mainstream media. And a current example of this is the lengths Macklemore and Ryan Lewis went to get their music heard. Because Lewis and Macklemore belonged to an independent label, they feared payola laws would interfere with their airtime. So they ‚Äúhired an independent arm of Warner Music Group, the Alternative Distribution Alliance, which helps independent acts get their stuff on radio. Zach Quillen, manager of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, discussed how \\"they paid the alliance a flat monthly fee to help promote the album.\\" One side effect of the vagueness of the law and the creation of the loophole is the expansion of the concept at the hands of online music sharing websites. In 2009, the website Jango created a plan to do payola legally by saying they have been paid to play the songs. \\"For as little as $30, a band can buy 1,000 plays on the music-streaming service, slotted in between established artists. The artists themselves choose what other music they'd like to be played next to.\\" See also * Frankie Crocker * Tommy Smalls * Radio promotion * Telling Lies in America * Cash for comment scandal * Claque * Plugola References Further reading   Dannen, Fredric.
