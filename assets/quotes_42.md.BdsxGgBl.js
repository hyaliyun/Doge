It was designed and built by William Cox from 1814 to 1826 with the support of a convict road party. It is also known as Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct and Coxs Road. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015.  History  The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months during 1814 and 1815 by a working party composed mostly of convicts. Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to have a carriage road constructed across the Blue Mountains, to the country which had been \\"newly discovered\\" by Europeans in 1813. The ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains, have been used as a transport corridor by people for tens of thousands of years. In the first 25 years of the settlement at Sydney Cove, several attempts were made to cross the mountains, but none resulted in a recognised successful crossing. Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth, searching for new pasturage made their famous \\"first\\" crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. The so called \\"First Crossing\\" took place on the traditional lands of the Dharug, Gundungurra and Wiradjuri people. Other routes through the ridges and valleys of the Blue Mountains had been used by Aboriginal people for tens of thousands of years. Cox was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset in 1764. He married Rebecca Upjohn at Devizes, Wiltshire in 1789. Cox arrived in NSW on board the \\"Minerva\\" in January 1800. Cox became Chief Magistrate at Windsor in 1810 and in July 1814 Governor Macquarie made William Cox the Superintendent of the works for a new road over the Blue Mountains. His first wife died in 1819 and Cox married Anna Blachford in 1821. He died on 15 March 1837. The hill now named Mount Blaxland is situated south-west of Mount York and south of Lithgow. In the published version of his journal, Gregory Blaxland wrote that on 31 May 1813:S Lavelle, 2013: Chapter 8 \\"Mount Blaxland: The Terminal Point and the Re-Claiming of Ownership\\" p.186 Mount Blaxland was named by Surveyor G. W. Evans, sent by Governor Macquarie to confirm the discovery of a passage over the Blue Mountains, in November 1813. Evans also plotted the location of the three sugar loaf shaped hills (Mount Blaxland, Lawson's Sugarloaf and Wentworth's Sugarloaf) on the map he prepared showing the traverse of the route he had followed.G. W. Evans, 1814, Plan of Journey to Bathurst from Emu Ford to Bathurst, prepared by Governor Macquarie's direction for the Guidance of William Cox, State Records NSW, Map SZ 160-162, SZ 313-315, SZ 316. William Cox began to examine a route for the road in the vicinity of Mount Blaxland on 11 December 1814. He commented in his Journal as follows:Whitaker, 2014: Chapter 4, William Cox's Journal: 65-66 A line which climbed a very long, steep and high ridge to the south of Mount Blaxland was selected and road- making commenced under the supervision of Mr Hobby by 13 December 2014. A few days later Cox noted that the road was completed 'except [for] turning some rock out of it after you ascend the hill at Blaxland's Mountain'. The road was finished as far as Jock 's Creek by December 17 and to around Mary Anne Creek by December 24. Cox's Journal records that ten small bridges were built over creeks between Cox' s River and the Fish River. During his tour over the newly completed Cox's Road in 1815, Governor Macquarie also described both Mount Blaxland and the road in the vicinity:Macquarie, Journals of His Tours, entry for 1 May 1815, p. 94.Mackaness, Fourteen Journeys, p. 69 A survey of the route of the Bathurst Road was completed by James McBrien in 1823. McBrien's fieldbook for this survey included a note that the road begins a \\"descent at the end on [or of?] the highest point of Mount Blaxland\\".J. McBrien, 1823, Field Book No. 205, p. 44, State Records NSW Over the next few years minor deviations and improvements were made to Cox's Road in this area of hilly country. In 1827 letters describing a journey to Bathurst along Cox's Road were published in the Australian newspaper under the pseudonym \\"X.Y.Z\\", probably by Captain William Dumaresq who had been appointed Inspector of Roads and Bridges in 1826. Describing his journey, \\"X.Y.Z.\\" wrote: The road from Cox's River is good enough, but every quarter of an hour you must dismount, either to walk your horse up or down the hills, which are tremendous and follow one another in rapid succession. Mount Blaxland is long and steep, and the road is taken over the very summit. The view does not repay you for the trouble of ascending, but ascend you must or stop and starve, for it is a desolate and barren place.Mackaness, Fourteen Journeys, p. 181 By 1829 Major Edmund Lockyer had selected a new line of road to Bathurst which completely abandoned the route via the Clarence Hilly Range and the Fish River. Lockyer's Road was soon superseded by that proposed by Major Thomas Mitchell, who had become Surveyor General in 1828. Mitchell re-surveyed the line of the road between Mount York and Bathurst, preparing a map showing a new line in 1830. This map showed the route of Cox's Road to Bathurst via the Fish River as the \\"Present Road by Mt Blaxland\\". Considering he had found a superior route, Mitchell ordered the transfer of the convict gangs from work near Mount York to the Mount Victoria descent in January 1830.\\"Sketch of the Road to Bathurst\\" marked out in 1830 according to a sketch made in 1827', Anon.,[but probably T. L. Mitchell] , State Records NSW, AO Map 5027. Same map also included in Mitchell's 1855, Report on Roads. These developments meant that the old Bathurst Road \\"by Mount Blaxland\\" was little used, except as access to private properties, which in this area were being occupied from the 1830s.  Description  William Cox had been instructed by Governor Macquarie only to open a rough cart road, so that the new lands found in the western plains would be symbolically open. The road from Emu Ford to Bathurst, a distance of was completed in only six months. Macquarie's instructions specified that the road should be at least wide in order that two carts would be able to pass each other, and that the timber should be cleared on each side so that the road corridor was wide. Stumps were to be grubbed out and any holes should be filled in. The surviving physical evidence shows relatively few locations where the extant road conforms with the dimensions specified in the instructions. A Crown Road is still reserved and shown on the cadastre in this area running from McKanes Falls Road to the Rydal-Hampton Road. Here the line of Cox's Road becomes more difficult to access as the road itself does not always align with the modern tracks or with what is noted as the \\"Old Bathurst Road\\". Therefore the actual road itself crosses in and out of private property. The physical evidence of the 1814 road where it is present through this area at the beginning of the \\"Clarence Hilly Range\\" is also overlaid with later 1820s work, essentially upgrading, re-building and improvement of the older road for at least a decade (most undertaken to 1827) before it was by- passed by the new lines selected by Lockyer in 1829 and by Mitchell in 1830. Both Mount York and the road by Mount Blaxland were avoided by the new road route. The evidence of road-building in this area includes more than one line, with most of the obvious extant fabric appearing to date from a later era than 1814. The modern unsealed farm track which coincides with the Old Bathurst Road runs some distance north of the line surveyed by McBrien in 1823. Cox's original road in this area likely required little cutting or forming over the easy grades, and therefore did not leave extensive physical evidence. There are remnants of pavement, quantities of cut stone, stone retaining walls of different sophistication and style, a constructed road zig-zag and stone box- culverts, all of which appear to relate to much later 1820s improvements. The reserved Crown Road diverges from the unsealed farm track and begins to climb to the southwest through more thickly timbered country. Here parts are cut through pink granite and various partly worked stone is lying around with short sections of retaining wall and some early road pavement evident, generally with a width of about . At approximately from the base of the hill, the road is formed into a substantial zig-zag which extends for . The zig-zag is supported by carefully constructed retaining walls which commence with a single course of roughly broken stone as edging and then rise steadily to about in height, with some stones squared, many not, but with a relatively smooth face. The bonding is random with the largest stones at the bottom and an even coping course at the top. The road here also features a packed stone pavement. Various piles of broken or worked stone left over from building operations scattered beside the road formation. There are also some sections of earth-faced cuttings and the road formation increases in width up to wide. At approximately from the end of the wall, a primitive stone box culvert is present, wide and deep, set on walls of two courses of squared stone, with a roughly cut lintel and an earthen floor. On the opposite side is a depression over the inlet area, and section of stone edged side drain is visible. The drain may continue further back down to the zig-zag , but it would need archaeological work to clear and excavate the area to determine this. Although McBrien's 1823 survey follows the line of this zig-zag, Grace Karskens has argued that comparative archaeological evidence suggests that the stone walls, formation width and pavement were added later as part of improvements to the original Cox's Road. Karskens comments that:Karskens, 1988: Mount Blaxland Precinct 14, p 91 In the vicinity of the \\"Old Bathurst Road\\" there are also a number of other road formations which appear to be early diversions and attempted improvements. Usually Cox's Road occupies the top or higher contours of the hillside. Cox's Road is characterised by steep unbroken climbs, narrow width , minimal cuttings and very rough simple retaining walls often using un- worked field stone or very crudely shaped boulders. The later road formations tend to be more curved and more carefully follow the contours or are actually built into the hillside in an attempt to improve the steep gradients of the original road. Further along the Old Bathurst Road there is another section of the walling which extends for almost one kilometre and features stone box culvert in the centre as the road climbs to the summit of the range at a height of more than 1000 metres above sea level. From the summit the line is indistinct, running directly down the grassy slopes of the ridge then passes over a saddle and descending through bushland and then more open and easier rolling countryside. Cox's Journal also noted that a number of bridges were needed in this area, however, few definite 1814 bridge sites have been located at any of the small creeks crossed by the presently reserved Old Bathurst Road. Remains of an early bridge which had been exposed by recent flooding were previously noted at Mary Anne Creek by Karskens in 1988. That bridge was identified as being pre-1827 and possibly even dating to the first phase of road building.Karskens 1988: Mount Blaxland Precinct 14, p 88 ff. From Mary Anne Creek the road rises uphill again, simply following vehicle tracks to the gate beside the \\"Karawatha\\" property which fronts the Rydal-Hampton Road. The reserved \\"Old Bathurst Road\\" then crosses the Rydal-Hampton Road where it becomes a modern local road, called Cut Hill Road. The general alignment and formation of the road is close to that of the original Cox's Road, although it has been straightened in some parts and therefore the old line crosses the modern road at some points. The current sealed modern road has also been re- graded and cut deeper. This section of modern local road is situated further west and it is not included in the Listing for Mount Blaxland Precinct. The proposed State Heritage Register listing of Cox's Road and Early Deviations includes six precincts of Cox's Road: *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Linden, Linden Precinct - HC Plan 2639 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Old Bathurst Road Precinct - HC Plan 2640 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Woodford, Appian Way Precinct - HC Plan 2641 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York , Cox's Pass Precinct - HC Plan 2642 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range / Mount Blaxland Precinct - HC Plan 2643 *Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Sodwalls, Fish River Descent Precinct - HC Plan 2644 = Condition = As at 1 December 2014, the condition of the road was good and substantially intact. Numerous archaeological features from early road lines are evident including road fabric, walling, culverts and road cuttings and formations. There is much physical evidence of various eras of Colonial road present. = Modifications and dates = *1820s  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries show the route of the road As at 29 January 2015, the surviving remnants of Cox's Road, built 1814 to 1815, have state significance as the earliest road across the Blue Mountains and the first structure built by Europeans west of the Blue Mountains. Building of this road followed from the prior exploration by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth, and the survey by George Evans. The successful construction of the road was symbolic of the conquest of the natural barrier created by the Blue Mountains, and represented Governor Macquarie's vision for the ongoing development of the colony beyond Sydney and its immediate surrounds. Cox's Road enabled the later opening of the hinterland beyond the Blue Mountains for subsequent settlement, pastoral and agricultural expansion, which then escalated the dispossession of Aboriginal peoples from their lands. William Cox was well known among convicts for his power to recommend pardons and tickets of leave. Most of the convicts who volunteered for the work to open a track to the interior were emancipated, receiving pardons or Tickets of Leave on completion of the work. The surviving road fabric demonstrates the crude and hurried nature of Cox's work, and the techniques used in tracing, cutting and forming the road. In conjunction with later colonial road alignments on the mountains and elsewhere, Cox's Road also forms part of a suite of roads demonstrating the wide range of road building styles and standards employed during the colonial period. Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Hartley, Clarence Hilly Range and Mount Blaxland Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 March 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state historical significance as physical evidence of the first road constructed across the Blue Mountains from Emu Plains to the Bathurst Plains (1814-15). Constructed in 1814-15 Cox's Road is one of the earliest Colonial-era road-lines surviving in Australia. The 1814-15 road is tangible evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the expansion of white settlement into western NSW. The road symbolises the occupation of the country and Governor Macquarie's aspirations for the eventual opening of the interior to European settlement after the discovery of the Western plains by G. W. Evans in 1814. In this respect the 1814-1815 Cox's Road has considerable symbolic significance as an official public work which laid the foundations for future development. Cox's Road is linked with the foundation of Bathurst, the first inland settlement in NSW, which was proclaimed by Governor Macquarie on 7 May 1815 after his journey along the road. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance for their close association with Governor Lachlan Macquarie who commissioned the building of the road into the interior, and with the magistrate and ex-army officer Captain William Cox, who supervised the building of the road. The road is also associated with the convicts who laboured on the road to obtain their liberty, and with the officers and men who assisted Cox such as Thomas Hobby, Richard Lewis, John Tighe and Samuel Ayres. The crossing of the Blue Mountains, the surveying of a route to Bathurst and the building of Cox's Road were significant events in the period of Macquarie's governorship. Governor Macquarie's view of the importance of the road is demonstrated by his reports to Earl Bathurst, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, and by his journey to the Bathurst Plains immediately after its construction, where he proclaimed the site for the Bathurst township. William Cox's achievement using a small group of convict men in a short period of time and with no loss of life caused by road-making or other substantial difficulties, was reflective of his reputation as a more humane employer and magistrate than many of his contemporaries. The leadership qualities, vision and skill he showed constructing the road would also be evident in later government contracts won by Cox for other public works . The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving precincts of Cox's Road have state technical significance for their ability to demonstrate simple, pre 1820s road building techniques. Improvement of the 1814 route throughout the 1820s also provide important evidence of later road building techniques and demonstrates the ongoing use of this key route to the interior, before it was superseded by the new Great Western Road laid out by Sir Thomas Mitchell in the 1830s. The Mount Blaxland - Clarence Hilly Range Precinct illustrates Cox's 1814-15 road and the way it was modified through the 1820s to service increasing traffic, until it became superseded by new road lines after 1830. It is possible to discern and demonstrate the difference between Cox 's first rough track and the -26 improvements to the alignment, gradient, width and stability of the road. The Mount Blaxland - Clarence Hilly Range Precinct has considerable archaeological potential as remains of a very early bridge (1815-1827) were previously identified at Mary Anne Creek, and numerous other potential bridge sites exist through this precinct. It is also likely that further archaeological work to excavate and clear key parts of the road formations in this precinct may reveal more detail regarding the early structures and construction features such as currently silted up or buried side-drains. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cox's Road and its remnants are demonstrated as having social significance at a state level by the substantial interest in identifying and promoting Cox's Road for cultural tourism and education, and celebrating the bicentenary of the road by the general public, state and local government bodies and a range of community organisations. The road is of particular importance to Cox descendants. The William Cox Fellowship first nominated sections of Cox's Road for heritage listing in the 1980s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Precincts of Cox's Road have research significance at a state level for their ability to demonstrate early nineteenth century road, culvert and bridge building techniques using basic skills and technologies. The remains of the 1814-15 road illustrate the conditions of the period and contribute to an understanding of the process of exploration and development, and of early colonial road building and road use. The remains represent a major physical, technological and engineering achievement and exhibit fine details of workmanship. Several precincts of the 1814-15 road have specific archaeological potential. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Surviving precincts of the 1814-1815 Cox's Road from Penrith to Bathurst are rare examples of early Colonial road building in NSW. The surviving remnants of Cox's Road have state significance as a rare example of pre 1820 road building based on the use of manual and primitive tools, and predating the more sophisticated road survey and construction techniques employed on the later \\"Great Roads\\" of the 1820s and 1830s.

The Left Alliance was formed in 1983 between students aligned to the Communist Party of Australia and the Socialist Caucus in the Australian Union of Students. The Left Alliance was intended to be a pluralistic socialist organisation designed to intervene in the Australian Union of Students and the student movement more broadly. However, the Australian Union of Students collapsed in 1984. By 1987, the Left Alliance consisted of the Socialist Youth League, the youth wing of the CPA, and Resistance, the youth wing of the Democratic Socialist Party, as well as independent activists. Resistance and the DSP opposed participation in the National Union of Students, which had been formed in 1987, on the grounds that it was dominated by the Australian Labor Party, and in December 1988, Resistance left the Left Alliance. In the 1990s, the Left Alliance became a distinct faction in the student left, rather than the grand alliance envisaged in the 1980s. For much of the 1990s, the Left Alliance dominated the University of Sydney Students' Representative Council; one of its members, Heidi Norman, became the first indigenous SRC President in 1994. In 1995, the Left Alliance at the University of Sydney produced Racism sux: an anti-racist handbook. By the end of 1997, the Left Alliance was disintegrating.

An avowed eclipse chaser, he best is known for having traveled around the world to see 27 total solar eclipses since 1954. He is also regarded as having spent more time in totality, the darkest area within the moon's umbra during a total solar eclipse, than anyone else alive.  Education  Liebenberg attended the University of Wisconsin as a physics major in the early 1950s. He holds three degrees, including a PhD, from his alma mater.  Career and eclipses  Liebenberg witnessed his first total solar eclipse on June 30, 1954, in Mellen, Wisconsin. Since then, he has traveled around the world to see solar eclipses, witnessing a total of 27 total solar eclipses. He observed his 27th, the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, from his driveway; by coincidence, his house in Salem, South Carolina, was located in the path of totality. His primary motivation for pursuing solar eclipses has been to study the sun's corona. To this end, he wrote a proposal and obtained a grant from the National Science Foundation in 1954. He later worked for the Los Alamos National Laboratory carrying out research into the temperature and energy input of the corona. In 1973, Liebenberg successfully petitioned French officials to commission an early Concorde supersonic aircraft for use in observing the solar eclipse of June 30, 1973. Flying on the Concorde, a group of scientists from Los Alamos and the Paris Observarory, including Liebenberg, remained in the path of totality for 74 minutes while conducting various scientific measurements of the corona.

Fell is a British biochemist and professor of systems biology at Oxford Brookes University. He has published over 200 publications, including a textbook on \\"Understanding the control of metabolism\\". in 1996.  Early work  Fell did research on the physical biochemistry of yeast pyruvate kinase. He obtained a position at Oxford Polytechnic as a lecturer. His early work at Oxford Polytechnic focused on hemoglobin where he developed more precise techniques for monitoring oxygen saturation and the breakdown of 2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric acid by Fe(III)-haemomlogbin. At this time he also worked on the first modeling studies related to the functioning of high- and low- _K_ m cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases on the regulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) Volume: Issue: 3 Pages: 555-561 DOI:  Later career  From the early 1980s David Fell switched his research to systems biology and was one of the very earliest systems biologists in the UK, with publications from 1979 onwards. The other notable systems biologist at time was Henrik Kacser at the University of Edinburgh. Given that his early work had a significant mathematical and computational component, he was ideally positioned to consider a more quantitative approach to studying the properties of cellular networks. It was against this background that he turned to the relatively new field called metabolic control analysis as a means to understand the principles of metabolic regulation. Before the development of metabolic control analysis, understanding metabolism was based on qualitative arguments which resulted in some incorrect conclusions (Rate limiting steps). Much of Fell's research for the next 20 years focused on extending and applying metabolic control analysis to metabolism. This work culminated in the publication of his textbook, \\"Understanding the control of metabolism\\". In 1986 he published with his graduate student Rankin Small, one of the earliest flux balance models where they used linear programming to examine the efficiency in the conversion of glucose into fat. He was also one of the first researchers to use the Gillespie method for stochastic simulation in cellular biology, a method that is now routinely used in systems biology. In the late 1990s his research started shifting more towards stoichiometric analysis with particular emphasis on elementary modes and the analysis of larger networks such as those involved in photosynthesis and whole genome scale models in a variety of organisms including one of the first genome scale models of Arabidopsis. Publications Other than his textbook which has been cited 1464 times (Sept, 2018), his top ten publications include: two publications related to the evolutionary age of metabolism using small world analysis, the definition of a pathway in terms of elementary modes, three reviews on metabolic control analysis including a republication of the seminal work, Control of Flux by Kacser and Burns, two research papers on metabolic control analysis, one of the earliest papers on the use of flux balance analysis, one of the earliest papers that describes a model the MAPK pathway in EGF signaling, and well as the earliest paper that describes the whole genome scale model of the plant Arabidopsis.

Among the theoretical references, they looked at C√©lestin Freinet and his colleagues in the Freinet Modern School Movement, but also took inspiration from the theories of the \\"dissidents\\", who studied institutional pedagogy - Raymond Fonvieille and Fernand Oury. Nevertheless, the lyc√©e autog√©r√© de Paris leaned closer to the self-management ideals of Fonvieille, than the psychoanalytical tendencies of Oury. From a practical point of view, the texts of scholars Georges Lapassade and Michel Lobrot promote this type of experience (\\"groups, organisation, institution\\" for the former, \\"institutional pedagogy\\" for the latter). The pedagogy of LAP also relies on the work of institutional psychotherapy (Ren√© Lourau and F√©lix Guattari). In practice, there is a conciliation between the different theories and practice, and the entire establishment is key to making it work.  Function  In the lyc√©e autog√©r√© de Paris, there are three types of members: * salaried teachers, responsible for experience vis-√†-vis the outside world; * a \\"specialist\\", a worker who carries out maintenance of the grounds, but who trains students who want it; * the students, there to acquire a secondary education. The participation of all in the actions and decisions that affect the life of the establishment is particularly sought after. Self-management is translated into (for the entire population of the establishment) structures such as grassroots groups, commissions, general management meetings, and a general assembly. In practice, LAP works so that life inside its premises is decided and executed \\"as much as possible\\" by all members of the community. The experience is run by a team of teachers who work in self-management: a teacher volunteers to work in the establishment, and is chosen by members of the team. For each teacher, paid by the National Education, participation in different areas is imperative. The participation of every student is encouraged, but not mandatory. According to LAP, this participation creates conflict with other projects: obtaining the baccalaur√©at, earning money, carrying out artistic projects, etc. Students are free to attend classes. For some, the inspiration is a \\"cooperative\\" ideology (voluntary membership), for others, a \\"consumerist\\" attitude, for others, \\"desire\\". Among the management, there is a team meeting, at least two hours per week, in the form of collegial leadership. Difficulties are analysed collectively and the analysis contributed to training all members of the group. The lyc√©e was considered by the Ministry as a pointer for the whole French education system, a \\"guide\\", to allow for the understanding of the system by the National Education. A very comprehensive \\"school project\\" is published each year by the lyc√©e team and gives detailed information about its operation. Contacts with a range of self-management companies have been developed since 2005 with exchange of alternative practices and ideas (\\"REPAS\\").  Results and rankings  A ranking published by the magazine L'√âtudiant in January 2009 gave the level of obtaining the Baccalaur√©at in the lyc√©e at 26%, ranking it, according to the magazine, last of the 1871 lyc√©es in France. In 2013, a ranking published in the magazine Le Monde again ranked the lyc√©e last in FranceLe palmar√®s des lyc√©es en 2013 in terms of added value compared to similar lyc√©es in the academy, and second-last in bac results with a rate of 30%. In 2015, the lyc√©e ranked 109th out of 109 at d√©partemental level in terms of teaching quality, and 2285th at national level.Classement d√©partemental et national du lyc√©e The ranking is based on three criteria: the level of bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur√©at having spent the last two years at the establishment, and added value (calculated based on the social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results).M√©thodologie du classement national des lyc√©es fran√ßais In 2018, an article in Figaro stated that in the lyc√©e, the level of bac results was around 40%, . The results are relative to the school, partly as students are not obliged to attend the courses, and also because the lyc√©e is as much about encouraging students to take part in cultural activities (photography, theatre...) to which they may never have had access, as it is about gaining the baccalaur√©at.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The bridge served from 1921 until 2006. History In 1920, there were only two major bridges crossing the river in the city of Flint. Due to its recent growth, this was inadequate for the transportation needs of the city. To help ease the congestion, the city instructed City Engineer Ezra Shoecraft to develop plans for a new bridge, crossing the river to connect Garland Street on the north and Beach Street on the south. Shoecraft commissioned Indianapolis bridge designer Daniel B. Luten, who had earlier designed other Flint bridges (including the still extant West Second Street‚ÄìSwartz Creek Bridge), to create a design for the new bridge. Luten delineated several options, and the city chose among them. The city awarded the contract to build the new bridge to the Illinois Bridge Company of Chicago, who had been the contractor for the city's previous Luten arch bridges. Work on the new bridge began in October of 1920, and was completed in the fall of 1921. By 2006, the bridge had deteriorated, with concrete spalling on the arches and sidewalks. In the middle of the year, the bridge was demolished and replaced. Description The Beach‚ÄìGarland Street Bridge was a two-span Luten arch concrete bridge, constructed from two heavily skewed filled spandrel arches spanning 80 feet. The arches were supported by massive concrete abutments on each bank and a central pier with bullnosed cutwaters. The arches were elliptically shaped with tapered arch rings marked with incised lines in the concrete. The arches supported an asphalt-surfaced roadway, flanked on both sides by concrete sidewalks which were cantilevered over the arch supports. Running external to the sidewalks were concrete guardrails with classical, cast-concrete balusters. Replacement Replacement bridge, 2010 The bridge was demolished and replaced in 2006.

History The building was commissioned by the Parish of St James's Church, Clerkenwell to replace an early 19th century vestry hall at the corner of Garnault Place and Rosoman Street which had been described as \\"the smallest and worst vestry hall in London\\". The site chosen for the new building was just to the north of the old vestry hall. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 14 July 1894. It was designed by William Charles Evans-Vaughan in the Flemish Renaissance Revival style and built by Charles Dearing of Islington; it was officially opened by the Leader of the Opposition, Lord Rosebery, as Clerkenwell Town Hall on 14 July 1895. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing onto Rosebery Avenue; the central section featured a projecting cast iron porch flanked by composite order columns on the ground floor; there was an arched opening containing a Venetian window on the first floor and a four small windows on the second floor with a projecting clock above. Internally, the principal rooms were the great hall, which was elaborately decorated in a Belle √âpoque style, and the council chamber which had a vaulted plaster ceiling supported by Ionic order columns. The great hall was illuminated by sculptures of female figures, known as the \\"Clerkenwell Angels\\", which were designed by Jackson & Co. and which supported brass light fittings, made by Vaughan & Brown. The original vestry hall was demolished in the late 1890s, allowing the new building to be extended to cover the whole area enclosed between Rosebery Avenue, Garnault Place and Rosoman Street. The new building became the headquarters of the enlarged Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury in 1900. During the Second World War an air raid shelter and control centre was built under Garnault Place with access from the town hall; this facility was then maintained as a nuclear fall-out shelter during the Cold War. The town hall continued to serve as the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury for much of the 20th century but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Islington was formed in 1965. It subsequently served as a register office and also as a social services centre. In 1993 a plaque was erected outside the town hall to commemorate the life of Sir Dadabhai Naoroji, the first Asian to become a British Member of Parliament. Islington Council closed the building, because of the rising cost of maintenance, in June 2003. Then, after a programme of restoration works to the designs of RHWL, the town hall re-opened as the home of the performing arts college, Urdang Academy, with the principal rooms used for dancing classes, in January 2007. It remains an approved venue for marriage and civil partnership ceremonies.

It later passed to the Wroth family, including the novelist Lady Mary Wroth, and regular visitors included Ben Jonson and Sir Philip Sidney. In 1745, it passed to the Whitaker family, and Miss Anne Whitaker left it to John Maitland, and then his son William Whitaker Maitland, who spent heavily on the building. It burnt down on 11 December 1836. A new Hall was built in 1878, designed by William Eden Nesfield in a mock Jacobean style. The last family member to live there was the Conservative politician Sir John Maitland, but it was requisitioned by the British Army during the Second World War to billet officers. It was sold to London County Council, and most of the land was used to build the Debden housing estate, with the Hall transferred to Essex County Council, and leased to Debden Community Association, and then given to Epping Forest College, but fell into disrepair by 2007.

Biography  Belov was born in 1972 in Moscow. He received his first term for theft. Freed in 1991, he soon committed a robbery, which ended in murder. On February 4, 1993, Belov was sentenced to 15 years in the Ulyanovsk prison. There he met his future accomplice, Sergei Aleksandrovich Shabanov (b. 1977), also a Moscow native. In 2001, Belov was released on parole, and Shabanov was released three years earlier, also on parole. The first murder was committed when Belov's friend Shabanov requested that they kill the merchant Alexander Cheresimov. For 500 dollars, both of them shot him on October 15, 2001.–ö–∞—Å—Å–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ—Ç 3 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 2004 –≥–æ–¥–∞. On December 26, on Festivalnoy Street in Moscow, Belov killed a woman who was returning from work. He stole a bag, purse, earrings, money and a cake from the deceased, which he carried home. The total value of the items was about 3000 rubles. On January 25, 2002, Belov and Shabanov killed another woman, a citizen of Austria, in a deserted yard on Zelenogradskaya Street. Like the previous victim, they stole her bag. The next attack by Belov and Shabanov was carried out on the evening of February 10 on Vyborgskaya Street with the same motives and method, this time stealing 100 rubles and a mobile phone, but the victim miraculously survived. After this attack, all criminal cases were combined into one, and the Interdistrict Investigative Brigade became engaged in it. The survivor helped make a facial composite, and the image was pasted all over Moscow and shown on television. However, the criminals weren't caught, and the crimes increased. On February 20, a new murder occurred. On February 22, at a house near Klinskaya Street Belov and Shabanov killed another woman. The next attack occurred on February 27 near Cherepanovs' Passage, with Belov hitting the victim with a baseball bat, but she furiously resisted and forced him to flee. But just a few hours later, on Lyapidevsky Street, Belov and Shabanov killed their final victim. Belov and Shabanov were not afraid of being caught: they drove to the crime scene by car, without fearing that someone could remember their number. They committed their crimes against middle-income people, but sometimes there were no more than 3 rubles in the victims' bags. Both got used to murdering, as Belov later said: \\"After the first corpse, it's hard to sleep, then you get used to it.\\" By this time, the whole of Moscow was talking about Khovrinsky Maniac, especially the frightened residents of the Northern Administrative District. The first surviving victim gave a detailed description of the brigand, from which the investigative brigadiers found out it was the twice before convicted felon Vladimir Belov.  Arrest, trial and sentence  Belov, who saw that they were coming to arrest him, jumped out of the secondary-story window, got into his Opel Vectra and disappeared. However, he and Shabanov were arrested a day later, and immediately gave testimony. Belov also confessed to all the murders in which he was accused, and at the same time tried to minimize his role in the crimes. At one of the interrogations, Belov said that if he was ever released, he would kill again. \\"I can not do anything else,\\" he complained to the investigator. Belov and Shabanov were recognized as sane. On December 10, 2003 the Moscow City Court sentenced Vladimir Belov to life imprisonment and Shabanov to 20 years imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict of Belov without changea, and he was sent to the \\"Black Berkut\\" colony in the Sverdlovsk Oblast. Subsequently, in 2005, another trial took place, in which Belov and Shabanov were found guilty of as many as 10 attacks, one of which, committed on October 16, 2001, ended in murder. Shabanov was resentenced to 21 years in prison, and Belov's sentence remained unchanged. The exact number of victims of the Khovrinsky Maniac and his accomplice is still unknown. According to an investigator, about 80 victims belong to Belov and Shabanov, but the court found them guilty of only committing 7 murders. = In the media = * Documentary film \\"Khovrinsky Maniac\\" from the series by Vakhtang Mikeladze \\"Documentary Detective\\" * Documentary film \\"He killed only women\\" from the series by Vakhtang Mikeladze \\"Sentenced for life\\" * Documentary film \\"The Man with a Bat in His Hands\\" from the series by Vakhtang Mikeladze \\"Lifelessly deprived of liberty\\" See also * List of Russian serial killers  References  Category:Thieves Category:Outlaws Category:1972 births Category:Russian serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Living people ","title":"Vladimir Belov (serial killer)"},{"id":"58565580","text":"Euthalia kanda is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae (Limenitidinae).

Biography  Little is known about Zayder's life before the October Revolution. Zayder was a very wealthy man and was even going to buy a mansion overlooking the Black Sea.http://www.peoples.ru/military/commander/kotovskiy/ At the same time, the underground, headed by Grigory Kotovsky, operated in Odessa. It took part in the raids on prisons and counterintelligence of General Denikin, seized weapons and transported it to the Transnistrian partisans, organized sabotage of the railways.  Acquaintance with Kotovsky  Zayder and Kotovsky met in the following circumstances. One day, fleeing persecution, the latter in the uniform of the captain of artillery came to him, turning directly from the threshold: Zayder hid Kotovsky in his attic. At night, having disguised himself in civilian clothes and wearing a wig, went down and left his apartment, saying that he was now his debtor. In 1919, Zayder was adjutant to the gangster and socialist Mishki Japonchik, and was known by the nickname \\"Majorchik.\\" In 1920, Zayder became unemployed, since the Soviet government, which was finally established in Odessa, closed the brothel owned by him. For two years he was interrupted by casual earnings. In 1922, Zayder learned that a cavalry corps was stationed in Uman, commanded by his debtor Kotovsky, and went to him with a request for help. Kotovsky helped Zayder, arranging that the head of the guard Peregonovsky sugar plant, located near Uman. Zayder, in turn, helped Kotovsky in settling the life of his corps. So, his idea was to prepare skins for cats and exchange them in Ivanovo for fabrics that went to uniforms. Zayder, according to eyewitnesses, was very grateful to Kotovsky for help, since finding work in the early 1920s was very difficult, and there were about 1.5 million people on labor exchanges (as of 1925).  Murder  Kotovsky's body after the murder In early August 1925, Zayder came to the Chebank farm, where Kotovsky lived temporarily. His motivation was that he wanted to help his family get together on the way back. It is possible that Kotovsky knew in advance about Zayder's arrival, but did not interfere with this, completely trusting him. In the evening of 5 August 1925, Kotovsky was invited to a \\"bonfire\\" at a pioneer camp near Chebanki Luzanovsky, after which he returned home. Approximately at 23:00 on the occasion of Kotovsky's departure, the red commanders who lived in the neighborhood decided to give him a solemn farewell. Kotovsky's wife recalled the moment of the murder: A bullet shot by a murderer from a revolver hit Kotovsky in the aorta. Death came instantly. Neighbors came running at the shots. The murderer soon appeared himself. Kotovsky's son recalled: At dawn of the same day, Zayder was arrested. During the investigation and at the trial he fully admitted his guilt, however, he often changed his testimony. So, during the investigation, he claimed that he had shot Kotovsky out of jealousy, and at court stated that he had killed him because he had not raised him up the ranks. The trial took place in August 1926. Zayder was sentenced to 10 years in prison. From the verdict, the charges were excluded in cooperation with the Romanian special services. The punishment of Meyer Zayder was serving in the Kharkiv pre-trial detention center, he soon became the head of the prison club and was transferred to an unconditional system of detention and was given the right to freely exit from prison to the city. In 1928, not having stayed in prison and three years, Zayder was released on parole for exemplary behavior. After his release, he got a job as a railway wagon co-driver. In the fall of 1930, the 3rd Bessarabian Cavalry Division, stationed in Berdichev, celebrated the tenth anniversary of its military path. On the occasion of the jubilee, a holiday and maneuvers were to be held, veterans of the division were invited, including the widow of Grigory Kotovsky, Olga Petrovna, who had once served as a doctor in his brigade. One evening three of her former colleagues came to her and said that Meyer Zayder had sentenced them to death. Kotovskaya tried to object to them, saying that Zayder was the only witness to the murder of her husband, and in no case could he kill him, but her arguments did not convince those who prepared the murder. Intending to prevent them, Kotovskaya turned to the division commander Mishuk and the Political Department of the division. Soon it became known that Meyer Zayder was killed in Kharkiv, not far from the local railway station. His corpse was found on the canvas of the railway. It is likely that, strangling him, the murderers threw Zayder on the rails in the hope of imitating the accident, but the train was late, and their plan failed. As it was later possible to establish, the killing was carried out by three cavalrymen who served together with Kotovsky ‚Äì some Strigunov, Valdman and the third, whose name is still unknown. Zayder's assassins were not convicted. According to the memoirs of Grigory Grigoryevich Kotovsky's son, the chief organizer of the murder of Zayder was Odessit Valdman, in 1939 he was shot in a very different matter.Belyaev Alexander. Who killed Robin Hood revolution? Interview with GG Kotovsky, 2000 Till now many researchers of Kotovsky's murder are convinced that Zayder was not the only and not the most important criminal, but acted under someone else's leadership. The materials about the murder of Kotovsky were classified. Zayder's friendship with Mishka Yaponchik and Kotovsky's murder, as an act of revenge, became one of the plot lines of the series \\"The Life and Adventures of Mishka Yaponchik\\". The role of Meyer Zayder (in the series he appears under the name Izya Majorchik) was performed by Alexey Filimonov.

The species has been redescribed by Amira Chaabane, Lassad Neifar, and Jean-Lou Justine in 2017, from the type-material and additional specimens. Description Pseudorhabdosynochus enitsuji, squamodiscs and haptoral parts Homologies of the sclerotized vaginae in species of the ‚ÄòPseudorhabdosynochus riouxi group‚Äò Pseudorhabdosynochus enitsuji is a small monogenean. The species has the general characteristics of other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, with a flat body and a posterior haptor, which is the organ by which the monogenean attaches itself to the gill of is host. The haptor bears two squamodiscs, one ventral and one dorsal. The sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers, as in other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus. The vagina includes a sclerotized part, which is a complex structure. Chaabane, Neifar, and Justine, in 2017 considered that the three species Pseudorhabdosynochus riouxi, Pseudorhabdosynochus bouaini, and Pseudorhabdosynochus enitsuji shared a common general structure of the sclerotized vagina with a conspicuous spherical secondary chamber and proposed to accommodate them within a ‚ÄòPseudorhabdosynochus riouxi group‚Äô.

The band currently serves with the deep emphasis in the importance of motivating police officers and the public, with some of its pieces encompassing marching, traditional, Arab, and British genres. In 1963, Brigadier General Ishaq Suleiman, a sergeant in a Jordanian Army Band, while on tour in London met with the niece of an official aide to the Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who wished to create a police band the city. She then invited Suleiman to the UAE to lead the band, giving him a ticket to Abu Dhabi so he could have the opportunity to consult with the Emir. He began recruiting members for the band from foreign countries such as Pakistan due to the common sentiment at the time by Emiratis about playing music, of which they considered shameful. He eventually created a 60-member band, made up of 30 bagpipes and 30 brass instruments. The band originally performed military marches, but time went by, Suleiman started teaching them famous symphonies by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mozart.

It has been described in 2007 by Lassad Neifar & Louis Euzet. The name refers to the absence of squamodiscs and is derived from the Latin ‚Äúsine‚Äù, indicating absence, and ‚Äúdiscus‚Äù, contraction of ‚Äúsquamodiscus‚Äù. The species has been redescribed by Amira Chaabane, Lassad Neifar, and Jean- Lou Justine in 2017 from the type material and additional specimens from Tunisia. Description Pseudorhabdosynochus sinediscus, haptoral parts; note that no squamodisc is present Pseudorhabdosynochus sinediscus is a small monogenean. The species has the general characteristics of other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, with a flat body and a posterior haptor, which is the organ by which the monogenean attaches itself to the gill of is host. The sclerotized male copulatory organ, or \\"quadriloculate organ\\", has the shape of a bean with four internal chambers, as in other species of Pseudorhabdosynochus. The vagina includes a sclerotized part, which is a complex structure. In contrast to most species of Pseudorhabdosynochus in which the haptor bears two squamodiscs, one ventral and one dorsal, the haptor of Pseudorhabdosynochus sinediscus is devoid of squamodiscs. This is the only species of Pseudorhabdosynochus with this characteristic. Hosts and localities The Goldblotch grouper Mycteroperca costae is the type-host of Pseudorhabdosynochus sinediscus.

Founded in 1968 by preservationists from Canada and the United States, it now has 1,500 members from 30 countries, with headquarters in Springfield, Illinois. APT‚Äôs activities include conferences, training and education programs, and publications on the technical aspects of preservation. APT members include architects, engineers, conservators, consultants, contractors, craftspeople, curators, administrators, program managers, developers, educators, historians, landscape architects, materials suppliers, students, technicians, and others involved in historic preservation. History Professionals in the field of historic preservation from Canada and the United States met in Canada in 1968 to form an organization that would promote the exchange of information and ideas pertaining to work on the constructed manifestation of cultural heritage, including not only buildings and landscapes, but also objects and collections. The organization‚Äôs first four aims and objectives, as published in the first Newsletter in April 1969, were: #To provide a useful forum to promote the quality of professional practice in the field of historic preservation in Canada and the United States. #To encourage the research, collection and publication of technical information in all aspects of historic preservation. #To encourage the training of professionals in preservation and restoration technology. #To encourage the training of craftsmen in the traditional techniques and skills required for historic preservation. The founding members were Alice Allison, David Bartlett, Gerald Budner, Jacques Dalibard, Oliver Torrey Fuller, George MacBeath, Pierre Mayrand, Jeanne Minhinnick, Lee Nelson, William Patterson, Charles E. Peterson, Jack Richardson, and Peter John Stokes. The first president was Charles E. Peterson. Early members, including Martin E. Weaver, the organization‚Äôs fifth president, and Morgan W. Phillips, were instrumental in establishing the field of architectural conservation. Mission APT‚Äôs mission is ‚Äúto advance appropriate traditional and new technologies to care for, protect, and promote the longevity of the built environment and to cultivate the exchange of knowledge throughout the international community.‚Äù Activities =Events= The initial impetus of the founders to combine the dissemination of scholarly studies of the history of building with discussions about the application of the philosophy and practice of heritage conservation technology resulted in a conference at the Pine Brook Conference Center in Upper Saranac Lake, New York, in 1969. The APT conference then became an annual event. Since 1975, training courses (now called workshops) were presented in conjunction with the conferences. From their inception, the conferences and training courses have been characterized by exchanges of ideas among practitioners, program managers and policy makers. APT has also presented training courses, workshops and symposia as stand-alone events, independent of annual conferences. =Publications= APT disseminates information through its website, electronic and print publications, and digital archives. The organization‚Äôs flagship publication is the APT Bulletin, a peer-reviewed journal published quarterly. The newsletter, the Communiqu√©, is published bimonthly and circulated through email. APT periodically publishes books in the field of heritage conservation. The most recent publications are the Preservation Technology Primer, a collection of articles from the APT Bulletin, and the second edition of Introduction to Early American Masonry, by Harley J. McKee. To disseminate information on historic building materials and systems, APT created the Building Technology Heritage Library (BTHL), a digital collection of historic building trade catalogs hosted by the Internet Archive. The collection is growing and had over 9,800 items in September 2018. =Chapters= As of November 2019 there are 21 local APT chapters, which allow interaction among members throughout the year. Fourteen chapters are in the United States, three are in Canada, with one in Australasia, one in Latin America, and new chapters for Europe and East Asia. Chapters host local events including visits to sites of interest to members, workshops, and symposia. =Technical Committees= Development and dissemination of technical information is mainly carried out by technical committees with specific focus areas. The technical committees are: Preservation Engineering, Sustainable Preservation, Modern Heritage, Documentation, Materials, and Codes.

The novel was originally published online in 2009 on Qidian Chinese Network. The first print volume was published by China Radio, Film & TV Press in 2017.  Plot  In the story, more than 500 people from early 21st century China intentionally travel back in time via wormhole to the Chongzhen-era late Ming Dynasty in 1628 AD. Settling in Lingao County on the island of Hainan, the time travelers set out to establish an industrialized society and change the course of history.  Publication history  The novel originates from an online BBS discussion started in the year 2006, about how time travelers can survive and change the history by using modern technologies. With permission, Xiao Feng, as one of the members of that BBS, collected the ideas by netizens of various educational backgrounds shawn in the discussion, and adapted them for a chuanyue novel. After several unsuccessful attempts of writing the novel by Xiao and the others, he eventually began to published the novel online in 2009, and then updated the chapters slowly. In the years after the first part was released, he continued to collect fan works written by more and more readers of the novel, and adapted them into the new chapters. In 2017, the first volume of a revised version by Xiao himself was published. More printed sequels are said to be on the way after that.  Responses and influence  From the 2010s, Illumine Lingao became an increasingly concerned work in China's Internet literature studies for its collective and collaborative style of writing, and for its detailed descriptions of the proto-industrialized \\"new world\\" built by the time travelers. The novel is praised as the \\"encyclopedia of time travel\\" among readers. Some critics also call it \\"a unique phenomenon of contemporary Chinese literature\\". Illumine Lingao has some similarities with the 1632 series by Eric Flint. But no evidence has shown that the latter work had significant influence on it. Xiao Feng and some of the major fan work writers have held (or participate in) some fan conventions in real life, including a 2017 lecture given by Xiao in Beijing University.

He was trained as a visual artist but has since specialized in pottery and ceramic sculptures. As a teacher, he has worked as a professor at the state university, trained local indigenous people and established the ceramic workshop which bears his name at Durango city's main cultural center. Life N√∫√±ez with students in the workshop that bears his name N√∫√±ez was born in the small rural community of San Jos√© de Gracia in the municipality of Canatl√°n, Durango to a family with Spanish and Tarahumara heritage. His father, Andr√©s N√∫√±ez Gallegos, was a farmer and political leader in the small town. His mother was Petra Soria Qui√±ones, who was a traditional housewife, taking care of the family and selling food to field hands on their way to work. N√∫√±ez was the youngest of six children, all of whom worked the family's fields and with their livestock. However, N√∫√±ez lived in his family's country home only until he was about five years old. In 1953, another local farmer, one of the richest in the town, came to the family's house enraged at N√∫√±ez's father over a matter with horses. A violent confrontation began. To defend her husband, N√∫√±ez's mother took a rifle and shot the attacker dead. The revenge of the man's family included burning down the home and forcing the family to flee: the father to the mountains and the rest of the family to the outskirts of Durango city to start over. The transition from rural to urban life was difficult for the family. N√∫√±ez describes himself as a child as a troublemaker but also extremely curious. The family got by selling a number of things including newspapers. N√∫√±ez attended the local public schools. In fourth grade, he was taught how to make small animals by his teacher using clay from a local ravine. It was this experience that taught him that to create was his vocation. He began by molding fish and turtles, figures that can still be seen in much of his work today. Trino N√∫√±ez applying sgaffito to a piece In 1973, he married Mireya Rodr√≠guez Vega when he was 24 at a time when large scale marriage ceremonies were sponsored by the state. The marriage lasted twenty years, producing four children: Gerardo, Xochiquetzali, Utzmaya and Iztacc√≠huatl. Later the couple adopted a fifth child, Iris Grisel. However, his wife did not completely support his artistic endeavors, which he considered to be the most important thing in his life. However, he does admit that he did have problems with alcohol during his marriage. Some years later, he married his current wife, is Norma Elizabeth Campos Galindo. This marriage produced two more children, Itzel and Metzi, as well as N√∫√±ez becoming stepfather to Luis Arturo and Alejandro Cortez Campos. Career Two of N√∫√±ez's works at the Museo de las Culturas Populares in Victoria de Durango Despite a four-year stint in the army that interrupted his professional education, N√∫√±ez says he never doubted that he wanted to be an artist of some kind. He began his formal artistic education at the Centro Universitario de Arte, Arquitectura y Dise√±o at the University of Guadalajara. Sometime later he would finish that degree in visual art from the recently established School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts of the Juarez University of the State of Durango. His early years as an artist and artisan had elements of experimentation. He once did a series of turtle figures with the faces of politicians. However, his artistic expression has since focused almost entirely on the preservation of Mexican and Durango traditions. N√∫√±ez's career as an artist has spanned over forty years. Although partially retired, he is still active, both as an artist and as a teacher. As an artist, he works with his wife and son, Gerardo N√∫√±ez Rodr√≠guez. N√∫√±ez's most widespread impact has been as a teacher and researcher. He has taught students of just about all ages, from classes in adobe homes to those in university. He estimates that he has taught over 8,000 students over his career, many of which have gone on to promote Durango culture both inside and outside the state. He began his teaching career in 1968 while still a student at the School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts in the 1970s, with which he also worked researching the state's clay deposits. Early in his career, he was a cofounder of a group called the Black Spider Circle, professors and artists who supported the first graduates of the School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts. He was one of the founders of the Workers and Employees Union of the Juarez University of the State of Durango, which was the model for similar organizations for professors. From 1992 to 2012, he was a full professor at the School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts, retiring from the school after 38 years. Brazier in blackened pottery by N√∫√±ez In 2001, he also became involved with a federally-funded project to teach extremely poor Tepehuan communities in the municipality of Mezquital pottery and ceramic techniques. . First he investigated the clays in the area, and found types suitable for high-fire utilitarian items such as bathroom fixtures and tile, as well as those suitable for low-fire domestic and decorative items. The goal was to help the residents of the area be self- sufficient in their communities, without having to migrate to Durango city or other areas to work. The decision was made to found mini-workshops attached to family homes. The success of this project is one of the artist's main sources of pride. N√∫√±ez has established three major ceramics workshops, his own called Taller Toltecatl, a workshop in Nuevo Ideal, Durango and the workshop in Durango city's main cultural center (Casa de Cultura), which now bears his name. This last one he founded in 1980, and has served as its main instructor since then. The classes he gives here are one of the center's main attractions, teaching not only ceramics, but also cartoner√≠a and alebrije making. He was offered the chance to introduce a new handcraft to the Casa de Cultura, including wood sculpture, but chose made cartoner√≠a alebrijes because of it is economical, making it accessible to more people. He also finds it limitless in terms of imagination. Most start out with one idea but then finish with something different as the alebrije develops. Exhibitions and recognition N√∫√±ez began formally exhibiting his work when he was about twenty five years old. Since then, he has exhibited locally, nationally and internationally. From 1964 to 1982 he exhibited regularly at the Los Tlacuilos gallery in School of Painting, Sculpture and Handcrafts, and still has shows there on occasion. The vast majority of his exhibitions have been in the state of Durango, including fine art venues such as the Guillermo Ceniceros Modern Art Museum. In 1995, he exhibited at the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City and in 2000 at the National Museum of Ceramic Handcrafts in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. He has also judged numerous handcraft competitions in the state. He is a quiet man, preferring that his work speak for him. He has Numerous other awards from municipal and state entities. His awards include first place at the XII State Handcraft Fair in 2010 in the ceramics category and the Benito Juarez Merit medal from the Juarez State University. The ceramics workshop in the Casa de Culutra was named after him in 2013. His work has been catalogued in a book called Sentimiento Barro-co which has been distributed throughout Mexico. His biography was published in 2017, published by the Consejo Editorial Municipal of the city of Durango titled Arcilla, cartones y vida, apuntes para una semblanza de Trino. written by Enrique Fernando N√∫√±ez Mart√≠nez.

He was found guilty of the murder of three people, rape and robbery, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  Biography  Balakin was born in the Ruzayevsky District as the family's second child, having two brothers. In his youth, he was aggressive, and in the senior classes always demanded money from weaker classmates and lower grade students, and then from passers-by. From 2000 to 2002, he was held four times as criminally responsible, but being a minor, he was only dismissed only with warnings and conditional terms. In 2003, in the hope of getting rid of problems with law enforcement agencies, the family moved to Nizhny Novgorod. However, Dmitry's behavior did not change and just a few days after the move, he robbed two women's valuables, and was soon detained by police officers. The court sentenced him to two years in a prison colony. However, in the second half of 2004, Balakin was released early for exemplary behavior. For some time Dmitry lived with his mother and brothers in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, but in March 2005 he returned to Saransk. He first got a job as a night watchman at a construction site, then as an auto mechanic. He soon met 30-year-old Elena Arkhipova, whom had a son, and they began to live together. Balakin was regarded positively by his neighbors. = Murders = On September 1, 2005, Balakin met with 20-year-old student Kristina Fedyakina, who was returning home late at night, and volunteered to accompany her to her house, to which she agreed. Just a few meters away from the house, Balakin forced the girl into the bush, where he raped her. The shocked girl then walked calmly to the house after the sexual act. Balakin, by his own words, felt an unprecedented physical and emotional upsurge. He caught up with the victim, dragged her back into the bushes where he raped her again, and then strangled her with the harness of her bag. Then he stole a purse, a mobile phone, as well as all jewelry and valuables from her bag, and disappeared. In the evening of September 8, 2005, Balakin met with student Ekaterina Tarasova near a store, and offered to accompany her home, to which she agreed. In the first secluded place, he raped and then strangled her with jacket sleeves, then took her wallet, earrings, gold cross and a ring from her hand, fleeing afterwards. Two weeks later, on September 22, 2005, Balakin got acquainted with one more student - Yulia Lanchina, with whom he spent several hours visiting the caf√© and the club, raping and then strangling her with her own sneakers' laces a few meters from her house. He then took her earrings and two rings and left the crime scene, later giving them to his wife Elena. On September 24, 2005, Balakin stole a car from the autoshop he worked at, in order to \\"ride\\", but failed to manage it and hit a pole at high speed. He suffered a lot of fractures and had to spend the next 6 months in hospital, which temporarily stopped the attacks. At the end of March 2006, Balakin left the hospital with a disability - he began to limp heavily with his left leg. Despite this, in April 2006 he went on \\"hunting\\" again. This time, Elena Sosnina, the victim of choice, resisted Balakin, who attempted to rape her, but she managed to escape. The limping Balakin, unable to catch up with her, took her wallet and mobile phone from the bag she dropped and disappeared. Sosnina appealed to the police, and also managed to find the criminal's phone, inserting the SIM card into her phone and making a call. Calculating from where the call occurred from, police arrived at Arkhipova's apartment. Initially, Arkhipova tried to lie to the investigators, claiming that she bought the phone from an unknown man for 3,000 rubles, but soon admitted that her 21-year-old cohabitant, Dmitry Balakin, had brought the phone. However, she did not know his location. = Arrest = Balakin was declared in the federal wanted list on suspicion of committing a series of murders. Ambushes were arranged at his mother's apartment and his cohabitant's, however, Balakin sensed something was off and stopped going there. Despite knowing that he was sought after, a few weeks after the attack on Elena Sosnina, Balakin attacked Elena Toropova walking with her child. Having raped her, he decided not to kill her in front of the child, and only took her purse. After some time in the elevator of an apartment, Balakin attacked Maria Perminova, but her husband struck the maniac in the groin, forcing him to run away from the scene. On July 20, 2006, police officers who were left on duty at the mother's apartment in Saransk detained a girl who tried to break in. It turned out that she was the daughter of Balakin's younger brother, sent by Dmitry to check out the apartment. She told that he was hiding in an apartment rented by his brother, and a few hours later the killer was finally captured. = Interrogations, trial and verdict = During the investigation of the murders, the investigators: * Developed 11 versions. * 51 searches were carried out. * Conducted more than 200 examinations. * Interrogated more than 900 witnesses. * Checked for involvement 272 suspects. Initially, Balakin denied any involvement in any of the attacks and murders. However, Elena Sosnina, Elena Toropova and Maria Perminova identified him as the criminal who attacked them. A DNA examination was also conducted, which showed that the sperm from Fedyakina's murder completely matched Balakin's. After this, he began to give confessions. On September 25, 2006, the court found Dmitry Balakin guilty of murdering three people, as well as multiple rapes and robberies, and sentenced him to life imprisonment in a special regime colony. The Supreme Court of Russia left the verdict unchanged. He served his sentence in the correctional colony \\"Mordovian Zone\\" in a village in the Zubovo-Polyansky District. A little later he was transferred to the Torbeevsky Central. = In the media = * Criminal Chronicles: \\"Unbrindled instinct\\".

Family background  The Du Lyon family was of the provincial nobility of the sword, with property on the border of Champagne and Burgundy. It can be traced to Hubert Du Lyon, squire and officer of the Duke of Burgundy in 1315. Jean Du Lyon, squire, was in charge of the fortifications of Dijon. His father was Ren√© du Lyon, squire, seigneur of Poinson and Poinsenot, a notary of Chaumont. His mother was Claire Sauvage, daughter of Nicolas Sauvage, adviser of the court of Chaumont. Claude Fran√ßois Du Lyon was squire, seigneur of Poinson and Poinsonot, maintained of nobility in November 1668 by M. de Caumartin, steward of Champagne. He was appointed an ordinary gentleman of the king's chamber and inspector of the armies of Flanders and Italy. Governor of Guadeloupe Claude Fran√ßois Du Lyon was the first governor of Guadeloupe for the French West India Company (Compagnie des Indes Occidentales). Governor general Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy arrived in Guadeloupe on 23 June 1664. He informed the governor Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√© that the king had ordered his recall. Hou√´l left for France on 4 July 1664. The next day Tracy abolished all the duties that Houel had imposed. Hou√´l's nephews d'Herblay and T√©m√©ricourt left the island for France on 12 July 1664. Tracy then replaced the garrisons of the three forts on the island with the king's men. He let Pierre Hincelin, commander of the Basse-Terre fort, take care of the interests of his brother- in-law Hou√´l, and gave Du Lyon command of this fort. Tracy appointed des Roses governor of Marie-Galante. Tracy made Du Lyon provisional governor of Guadeloupe and left for Grenada on 5 November 1664. Du Lyon's second wife Claire Tabourot followed him to Guadeloupe. In March 1665 he was confirmed as governor of Guadeloupe for the king and the company. After Tracy had left for Canada, disturbances broke out in Martinique in 1665. Martinique governor Robert de Clodor√© and the company's general agent de Chambr√© were unable to restore peace, and called on Du Lyon to send help in the form of several companies under his lieutenant Hincelin. The disturbances were over before this force arrived. Du Lyon appears to have been a capable administrator and active in military affairs. He was wounded during an attack on the English in Antigua. In 1669 the government of Guadeloupe was joined to that of Martinique until 1677, when Pierre Hincelin became governor for the king. The governor- general Jean-Charles de Baas took office on 4 February 1669. De Baas was critical of Du Lyon, but this may be because he consistently claimed that the government of Guadeloupe was independent of that of Martinique. A letter has been preserved in the Naval Archives dated 1 May 1672 reproaching Du Lyon for his endless quarrels with de Baaz, and there is another dated 23 March 1674. Du Lyon died on 14 September 1674. Three months later the company was suppressed. Wives and children In 1653 Du Lyon married Madeleine du Val, daughter of Edm√© du Val, Lord of Mouilleron, Rivi√®res, Mornay and Nizy. They had two children: * C√©sar Saladin du Lyon * Claire Pierrette du Lyon. On 15 September 1663 at the seigneurial house of V√©ronnes he married Claire Tabourot, daughter of Alexandre Tabourot, Seigneur of V√©ronnes and Lieutenant General of Water and Forests of Burgundy. Six children were born to this union: * Charles Albert du Lyon (abb√©) * Claire Christine Marie Anne du Lyon * Claude du Lyon, king's Lieutenant de vaisseau * Christine du Lyon, nun of the Abbey of Parc-aux-Dames(fr) in 1719, then abbess in Provins in 1730 * Fran√ßois du Lyon, captain of a compagnie franche of the navy, Enseigne de vaisseau, captain of the islands in 1680 and major of Guadeloupe in 1691 * Claude Antoine du Lyon, naval guard, lieutenant in Martinique in 1691, Enseigne de vaisseau in 1693 then Captain of Saint-Domingue in 1695.

It was intended to bring to an end the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, with the repatriation of French troops to France and the return of all territory to the Ottomans. In December 1799 the British government had issued orders that its commanders were not to allow a separate treaty to be agreed between the Ottomans and France in which their troops would be returned to Europe. However these instructions did not reach the British naval commander in Egypt, Sidney Smith, until after the convention had been signed. When Smith and his senior officer, Lord Keith, communicated this stipulation to the French forces the French commander Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber was outraged. He ordered his troops to attack the Ottomans and won the subsequent Battle of Heliopolis on 20 March. When it heard of the convention the British government agreed to honour it, but it came too late. Hostilities continued until the surrender of French forces at Alexandria in August 1802, after which the French troops were returned to France on board British ships, in accordance with the terms of the original convention.  Background  France invaded the nominally Ottoman- ruled Egypt in 1798 with an army led by Napoleon Bonaparte. Initially successful in taking control of key cities, an expedition to Syria led to defeat and Napoleon returned to France after successfully defeating Ottoman force at the Battle of Abukir in July 1799. Napoleon left command of the French forces in the hands of Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber. The army was in a poor position, threatened by Ottoman force under K√∂r Yusuf Ziya√ºddin Pasha advancing from Syria and Kl√©ber's troops were near to mutiny following their abandonment by Napoleon.  Convention  Sidney Smith Kl√©ber made contact with the commander of local British naval forces, Commodore Sidney Smith, with regards to entering peace negotiations. It has since been disputed by historians as to whether either man had the necessary authority to carry out the negotiations and to agree any compromises, but with their governments being two months travel away it seems that a pragmatic approach was taken and negotiations began via letter. Kl√©ber stated that any peace would be contingent on his men being allowed to leave Egypt on board Ottoman ships with all their baggage and weapons. He demanded safe passage from attack by Ottoman forces, a dissolution of the alliance of the Ottoman Empire with Britain and Russia and for the Ottoman Empire to pay the costs of feeding and lodging French forces until they could be evacuated. Kl√©ber also wanted an immediate halt to all offensive action and movement of Ottoman forces, an action that Yusuf refused to agree to. The 250-strong French garrison at El Arish mutinied and opened the town to occupation by Ottoman forces. The Ottomans began a massacre of the French troops until halted by their British liaison officer. Shortly afterwards Smith, Yusuf and two of Kl√©ber's officers met in the town to open negotiations. Yusuf stated that he would provide safe passage and transport back to France but was not willing to meet the remaining requests. Kl√©ber then dropped his requirement for a halt to the movement of Ottoman forces and conceded that the alliance between the Ottomans and Russia and Britain could remain in place until a formal peace treaty could be agreed. Kl√©ber insisted that the Ottoman empire needed to pay for the upkeep and provisions of the French troops until the evacuation could be agreed. Yusuf agreed to the revised terms and signed the convention on 24 January 1800. Smith did not sign the document.  Aftermath and repudiation  Admiral Lord Keith General Menou Kl√©ber personally ratified a copy of the convention on 26 January and copies signed by Yusef and Kl√©ber were formally exchanged on 30 January. French garrisons were withdrawn to Alexandria, Aboukir and Rosetta to await transport. However Smith's commander Lord Keith had received orders from London, dated 15 December 1799, that he was not to allow any separate treaties to be agreed between the Ottomans and France nor \\"to consent to any capitulation with the French troops at least unless they lay down their arms, surrender themselves prisoners of war, and deliver up all the ships and stores of the port of Alexandria to the Allied Powers\\". He was further ordered to intercept any ships carrying out an evacuation of French troops from Egypt. Keith sent a letter conveying this information to Smith from his headquarters at Minorca on 8 January but this did not reach him until after the convention was signed. Smith communicated that the convention, as it was agreed only between the Ottomans and France, was invalid in a letter of 21 February but stated that he was hopeful that the British government would reconsider upon reading the details of the convention. Keith, when he heard the details was supportive of the convention but also sent a letter to Kl√©ber with details of his orders that demanded nothing less than an unconditional surrender. This letter reached Kl√©ber at Cairo on 18 March, by which time Yusef had moved an army of 40,000 men to nearby Heliopolis. Kl√©ber was outraged and led his troops against Yusuf. He inflicted a heavy defeat upon the Ottoman forces in the 20 March Battle of Heliopolis. Kl√©ber was assassinated in Cairo on 14 June by Suleiman al-Halabi, a Syrian student supportive of the Ottoman cause. Kl√©ber's successor was General Jacques-Fran√ßois Menou. In the meantime the British government, led by William Pitt the Younger, had received a copy of the convention and agreed to its acceptance. However a British envoy, Lieutenant Wright of HMS Tigre, did not reach the French troops until 22 August at which point he was refused admission to Alexandria - General Menou being optimistic of French fortunes in a renewed campaign. Wright endeavoured to communicate the acceptance to the French rank and file and induce them to revolt against their generals who refused to allow them to go home, but was turned away. Upon hearing of this rejection the British government decided upon a fresh offensive to evict the French from Egypt. This was successfully carried out resulting in the surrender of French forces at Alexandria in August 1801 and the subsequent repatriation of French troops on British ships.  British parliamentary debates  The British government's actions in regards the convention were criticised in the House of Commons by MP Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones. He put forward a motion on 2 June 1801 to discover who had initially ordered that no treaty was to be agreed to. Jones praised Smith's actions and stated that the requirement of keeping British troops tied up in Egypt to fight the French may have caused the loss of Hanover to the forces of the Second League of Armed Neutrality in April 1801; the loss of Portugal to Franco-Spanish forces during the War of the Oranges in June 1801; and severely weakened the defences of the British Isles. Jones' opponents said that he had unsuccessfully raised the issue on no fewer than 12 occasions and his latest motion was defeated by 138 votes to 22.

Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Ever since statehood, North Dakota had been overwhelmingly Republican at state level and in many presidential elections,Hansen, John Mark; Shigeo Hirano, and Snyder, James M. Jr.; ‚ÄòParties within Parties: Parties, Factions, and Coordinated Politics, 1900-1980‚Äô; in Gerber, Alan S. and Schickler, Eric; Governing in a Polarized Age: Elections, Parties, and Political Representation in America, pp. 143-159 although progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson was able to carry the state in both his campaigns, in the second due to his anti-war platform. The Russian-Germans who dominated North Dakota‚Äôs populace were vehemently opposed to President Wilson‚Äôs pushing of the nation into World War I and his ‚ÄúLeague of Nations‚Äù proposal.Lubell, Samuel; The Future of American Politics (1956), pp. 156-164 To this populace descended from Germans who had settled in Russia, Wilson‚Äôs entry into the war and his support for the Treaty of Versailles was a betrayal, whilst farmers were also faced with a postwar agricultural depression as prices fell with reduced demand in Europe.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 420-423 Consequently, North Dakota went for the isolationist Warren G. Harding over the pro-League Democrat Cox by four-to-one. Despite Harding‚Äôs massive victory, discontent amongst North Dakota‚Äôs large farm population persisted during his term,Shiedeler, James H.; ‚ÄòThe La Follette Progressive Party Campaign of 1924‚Äô; The Wisconsin Magazine of History Vol. 33, No. 4 (June 1950), pp. 444-457 but the national Democratic Party did nothing to provide any hope of regaining Wilson‚Äôs prominence in North Dakota, being instead dominated by conflicts between its Southern and Western faction led by William Gibbs McAdoo and its urban Northeastern faction led by Al Smith.Grantham, Dewey; The South in Modern America A Region at Odds, p. 106 A fierce debate ensued that saw a compromise candidate, former Congressman John W. Davis of West Virginia, nominated after one hundred and three ballots in hot summer weather at Madison Square Garden.Paulson, Arthur C.; Realignment and Party Revival: Understanding American Electoral Politics at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century, p. 51 Although West Virginia was a border state whose limited African-American population had not been disenfranchised as happened in all former Confederate States,Ranney, Joseph A.; In the Wake of Slavery: Civil War, Civil Rights, and the Reconstruction of Southern Law; p. 141 Davis did share many views of Southern Democrats of his era. He supported poll taxes, opposed women's suffrage, and believed in strictly limited government with no expansion in nonmilitary fields.Newman, Roger K.; The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law, p. 153 In North Dakota, Davis had almost no appeal, especially as he unlike incumbent Calvin Coolidge supported the League of Nations and was opposed to the state‚Äôs isolationist views. Although in September he underwent an extensive tour of the Great Plains,Tucker, Garland; High Tide of American Conservatism: Davis, Coolidge, and the 1924 Election, p. 191 and campaigned to eliminate the income tax burden of the poorer classes,Richardson, Danny G.; Others: \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette and the Progressive Movement: Third-Party Politics in the 1920s, p. 180 Davis received a mere 6.96% of the vote in North Dakota, his second-weakest state behind neighbouring Minnesota. The agrarian Nonpartisan League, as a response to the conservatism of the major parties, nominated Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, with Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, as a third-party ticket, supported by the state‚Äôs Senators Lynn J. Frazier and Gerald P. Nye. Vote Davis and Coolidge both spent most of their campaign attacking La Follette as a political extremist,Parrish, Michael E.; Anxious Decades: America in Prosperity and Depression, 1920-1941, pp. 70-71 but nonetheless opinion polls showed that La Follette was attracting large numbers of those German-American and Scandinavian-Americans who completely deserted Cox in 1920.Tucker; High Tide of American Conservatism, p. 181 In September some polls had La Follette winning sufficient electoral votes to give no candidate an electoral majority and force the House to make a choice,Tucker; High Tide of American Conservatism, p. 231 but as polling day approached newer polls suggested incumbent President Calvin Coolidge would hold the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada and Montana, which La Follette had been predicted to win in August. Coolidge ultimately won North Dakota by a narrow margin of 2.51 percent, with his win coming from the relatively urbanized Scandinavian- settled counties in the east. With 45.17 percent of the popular vote, North Dakota would prove to be La Follette's second strongest state in the 1924 election in terms of popular vote percentage after Wisconsin. This was one of only two states, the other being Wisconsin, in which La Follette won a majority of counties.The Presidential Vote, 1896‚Äì1932, Edgar E.

The film stars William Berger, Daniela Giordano and Krista Nell. It is about a fashion model named Gail Bland who travels to Cairo where she meets a mysterious man named Caleb. Bland then runs into a cult of hippies who worship Osiris and make human sacrifices. The film was shot at Cinecitt√† and on location in Egypt. The film had a troubled production history being shot during the War of Attrition in Egypt and with cast members signing on shortly before production (William Berger) and the female lead being replaced with Daniela Giordano during the first day of production. The release date in Italy of Shadow of Illusion is unclear, with Associazione Nazionale Industrie Cinematografiche Audiovisive e Multimedia (ANICA) dating the first public screening of the film to be April 16, 1972 while La Stampa wrote about a screening as early as 1971. Production Director Mario Caiano began work on Shadow of Illusion right after his film Love Birds ‚Äì Una strana voglia d'amare. The film began production under the original title Le ombre. Caiano recalled that the film had a strange production with producers who were not seen before or after production. Caiano was promised by the producers an actor that was internationally known for the film, but did not get him. William Berger was shooting La colomba non deva volare in Egypt at the time and got in contact to star in the film. Other members of Berger's family joined the cast including his daughter and his wife Carol Lobravico. Shadow of Illusion was shot at Cinecitt√† studios in Rome and on location in Egypt. Daniela Giordano became the lead actress after the initial lead left production after the first day of shooting. Caiano said the original lead for the film was Luciana Paluzzi while Giordano insists the actress was Gianna Serra. Shooting was during the War of Attrition where Egypt was at war with Israel making production difficult. While filming in the desert, the crew had to be escorted by soldiers who would turn of the lights in case of air raids. Caiano claimed he never watched a completed version of the film and only finished a rough cut of it. Release Film historian Roberto Curti described the film as having a \\"troubled commercial life.\\" The film was submitted to the Italian Board of Censors in April 1970 with the title Le Ombre Roventi. The Italian release date of the film is unclear. The Associazione Nazionale Industrie Cinematografiche Audiovisive e Multimedia (ANICA) date the first public screening of the film to be April 16, 1972 while the newspaper La Stampa records the film being released in Imperia on July 13, 1971. Publicity material for the film is dated October 1970. The film was distributed by Icar and grossed 25,525,000 Italian lire in Italy. The film has been released as Shadow of Illusion on what Curti described as a \\"badly panned-and-scanned English-language copy of a Japanese laserdisc\\".

Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. South Dakota voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, over Independent nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia. Coolidge ran with former Budget Director Charles G. Dawes of Illinois, while Davis ran with Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska and La Follette ran with Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler. Coolidge won South Dakota by a margin of 12.73% of the vote. With 36.96 percent of the popular vote, South Dakota would prove to be La Follette's fifth strongest state in the 1924 election in terms of popular vote percentage after Wisconsin, North Dakota, Minnesota and Montana.

It would later inspire the design of another, more famous apartment block built by Guy Morgan in London: Florin Court. Cholmeley Lodge was originally proposed and planned to be built on Bournemouth seafront, but the local council did not approve the modern design, requiring some Tudor-style timberwork to soften the elevation.

They were both executed on 8 September 2018 on the charge of killing the son of the Imam of Marivan's Friday prayers imam. Amnesty International has said that the men had been denied access to legal counsel after being arrested. After their sentences were issued, they wrote in a letter that they were forced to confess under duress and torture and that they had not played a part in the assassination. Moradi maintained that for nine months after his initial arrest, authorities had detained him for membership of the Komala Party. Zaniar Moradi‚Äôs letter to Asma Jahangir In a letter addressed to Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, on 14 November 2016, which he co-wrote with his cousin Loghman, he detailed the torture and sexual threats that they were subjected to in order to make a confession. According to the letter, the judge overseeing the court had also stipulated that the case was incomplete and that there was not enough evidence against them. Death of his father Eghbal Morad, father of Zaniar Moradi, was killed on 17 July 2018 near the Panjavin River in Sulaymaniyah, Iraq which borders the town of Marivan in Iran. According to a statement issued by the Kurdistan Human Rights Group, Eghbal Moradi was a leading member of the group. Before his death, he had rejected the charges against his son and nephew saying that his 20-year-old son was only following up his education. International reaction Philip Luther, Amnesty International‚Äôs research and advocacy director for the middle east and North Africa condemned the execution of Zaniar Moradi and the other two prisoners and said:\\"‚ÄúWe are horrified by the news that the Iranian authorities have executed these men, despite widespread condemnation of their death sentences and calls from UN human rights experts and other bodies to halt their executions.\\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on the opening statement to the 39th Session of the Human Rights Council on 10 September: \\"... they were not afforded fair trials, and were subjected to torture.

After the Battle of Pered Haynau's army, joined by the Habsburg emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, crossed the Danube to the southern bank of the river, without being noticed by the Hungarian troops, and attacked the Hungarian units (the detachment of H√ºm√©r Kupa, the Liptay-division and the Kmety-division) displaced around Gy≈ër, placed to √Årp√°s, Marcalt≈ë and Ih√°sz (today a part of Marcalt≈ë), cutting Gy√∂rgy Kmety's division from the main troops and forcing them to retreat towards Southern Hungary. The imperials were greater than five times more numerous than the Hungarian troops (69 350 imperials - 12 888 Hungarians) when they started the attack against Gy≈ër. The Hungarian high commander, G√∂rgei at the start of the battle was not in the city, because at 26 June he had to participate in a ministry council at Pest, and arrived to Gy≈ër only towards the end of the battle, and assured, leading the Hungarian cavalry, the safe retreat of the Hungarian troops from the city. After the battle, G√∂rgei's troops retreated to the fortress of Kom√°rom, followed by the imperial troops. Background Art√∫r G√∂rgei's failed offensive attempt which ended with the Hungarian defeat in the Battle of Pered on 20 and 21 June 1849. This attack of the Hungarian troops was chosen in a very unlucky moment, because Field Marshal Julius Jacob von Haynau on 19 June started to cross his troops from the left (northern) banks of the Danube to the right (southern) banks of the river, in order to prepare for the advancement towards the Hungarian capitals of Pest and Buda. But he still had enough troops to deploy with around 15 000 more soldiers in the battle than G√∂rgei, thanks to the Russian division led by Lieutenant-General Feodor Sergeyevich Panyutyin, misleading the Hungarian commander about Haynau's plans, thinking that the enemy would remain on the left banks of the Danube. But of course after the battle Haynau continued undetected, to cross his troops on the right banks of the river.. Gy≈ër by Fruhmann Antal 1845 During this time, the relations between Lajos Kossuth, the governor of Hungary, the Szemere-government, and its secretary of war, G√∂rgei, worsened in a rapid rate, causing, a conflict between the political and military leadership of Hungary, which lasted until the Hungarian Surrender at Vil√°gos, affecting in a negative way, the Hungarian efforts of defence. At the middle of June, in a memorandum, G√∂rgei openly declared that he is against the Hungarian Declaration of Independence from the Habsburg-dynasty (proclaimed on 14 April 1849), thinking that this was the cause which triggered the Russians to send their troops to crush the Hungarian revolutionHermann R√≥bert / Kossuth √©s G√∂rgei, Iskolakult√∫ra. (1998/3) pp: 90 (concerning this matter G√∂rgei was wrong, because the discussions between the Habsburg empire and the Russian Empire about the Russian intervention started already at the end of March, so with two weeks before the Hungarian declaration of the independence).. After 21 June, G√∂rgei, who was in the same time the commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army and the Minister of Defence of Hungary in the Szemere- Government. This is why he was forced to often move between Pest and his general staff office from Tata.G√∂rgei Art√∫r √âletem √©s m≈±k√∂d√©sem Magyarorsz√°gon 1848-ban √©s 1849-ben, (2004) On 24‚Äì26 June he was in the capital, participating in a ministry council, where he managed to convince the government to accept his strategical plan of gathering all the Hungarian forces (except of those of Transylvania and Southern Hungary) around Kom√°rom, in order to create a numerical superiority, with which he planned to strike against the troops of Haynau, crushing them, and march against Vienna, or if that would fail, to retreat to Kom√°rom. The cause of this desperate and surprising plan was the fact that on 15 June the Russian troops crossed Hungary's borders, entering with 193 000 soldiers and 584 cannons in order to crush the Hungarian resistance.. This armies duty was to help the 165 000 Austrian soldiers with 770 cannons against the 150 000 Hungarians and their 857 cannons (464 field cannons and 393 fortification cannons).. Hearing about this G√∂rgei realised that the Hungarians have no chance to win, only if they would destroy Haynau's Austrian forces, before the Russian troops would arrive to help them, which would cause the Habsburg government to try to negotiate. In the ministry council held in the evening of 26 June, despite of the anti- G√∂rgei feelings of the majority of the politicians and officers, finally G√∂rgei's plan was accepted. On the morning of 27 June, G√∂rgei returned from Pest to Tata to his general staff office, to take over again the leadership of the troops, because he heard about the concentration of the enemy troops in the proximity of Gy≈ër.. This operational plan had the purpose to totally encircle the Hungarian troops from Gy≈ër, forcing them to surrender. Their minimum purpose was to cut the Kmety-division from the Hungarian VII corps, stationing in Gy≈ër, led by Ern≈ë Poeltenberg, and to force them to evacuate the city. Prelude On 27 June G√∂rgei learned that the Austrian army is preparing to attack on the line of the river R√°ba, and during the evening he was informed that the enemy crossed the river, cutting the Kmety-division from the VII Hungarian corps which defended Gy≈ër. With this the enemy encircled the positions of the VII corps, which meant that in the next day, the enemy will start a concentric attack. Knowing this, G√∂rgei departed at that night towards Gy≈ër. The antecedents of these events were as it follows. At 26 June, the attack of the imperial troops started. Their plan was simple: their III corps (the right wing of Haynau's army) had to encircle the Hungarian positions from Gy≈ër. On 27 June the main body crossed at √Årp√°s, the Gerstner-brigade from the right wing at Marcalt≈ë, and the Schneider-brigade from the left wing at Bodonhely. Then the Gerstner-brigade had to advance to Lesh√°za, take position on the road towards P√°pa, and to cower the advancement of the main body from an eventual attack coming from that way. The main body of the Austrian army had to advance to Pannonhalma, or, if the IV corps would have been not enough to defeat alone the Hungarian troops from Gy≈ër, they had to march towards T√°pl√°n. Julius von Haynau (Giuseppe Bezzoli, 1853) . The IV corps (called also the reserve corps) had to advance on 27 June towards L√©b√©ny, on 28 to cross the R√°ba at R√°bapalota, and after uniting with the Scheider-brigade to attack towards Szabadhegy. They had to be followed by the Benedek-brigade and the Russian division led by Fyodor Sergeyevich Panyutyin. In the same time on 28 June the I corps had to attack towards Abda. The II corps remained on the right banks of the Danube, defending Csall√≥k√∂z and the lower V√°g region.. In the most optimistic situation Haynau's operational plan enabled them to encircle the Hungarian VII corps led by Ern≈ë Poeltenberg, and force them to surrender, while the minimal goal of the plan was to cut them from the Kmety- division, and to chase out the VII corps from the city. Knowing the huge numerical superiority of the imperials (69 350 soldiers against 17 480 Hungarians),. even Haynau's most optimistical goal looked achievable. A lithograph of Ern≈ë Poeltenberg by Elek Szamossy On the other hand, the goal of the Hungarian commander of the VII corps, Major-General Ern≈ë Poeltemberg, was to hold on as long as possible, until he hoped to receive reinforcements. Unfortunately it was no chance for reinforcements. The Hungarian Operational Office, led by Colonel J√≥zsef Bayer, sent the Hungarian II corps on 28 June to G√∂ny≈±, the I corps to Hull, and the III corps to √ârsek√∫jv√°r. On 26 June the Hungarian division led by Gy√∂rgy Kmety, with his 4530 soldiers and 15 cannons moved away from the R√°ba-line, retreating towards P√°pa. The reason of his move was the crossing of superior enemy troops, before his reinforcements and 4000 cartridges arrived to captain Zsigmond Horv√°th who commanded a company of the 33 battalion. Even if the reinforcements would have arrived in time, against the four enemy battalions commanded by Colonel Karl Wolf von Wachentreu Horv√°th would have had no chance to withstand. During this retreat the Hungarians lost 16 (according to other sources 30) soldiers.Hermann R√≥bert Az ih√°sz √ºtk√∂zet eml√©kk√∂nyve, P√°pa, 1999 Kmety wanted to cross the R√°ba at P√°poc, and to attack from the back the advancing enemy, but he needed more troops. So he waited for his battalion which was sent before to M√≥richida, but when tis returned, he saw that the soldiers are too tired to try another march with them. In this situation he was forced to retreat from Marcalt≈ë. Some Hungarian officers were surprised by this decision of Kmety, like Lieutenant-Colonel Emil √úchtritz, who in the morning of 27 June, hearing the report of the vanguards about the enemy movements, rushed with his half artillery battery to the banks of the R√°ba right when the Austrians started to make a pontoon bridge over the river, and right when he was ready to order fire against the enemy, Kmety arrived to take command, but when the Austrian Kaiserj√§gers started to shoot in them, he ordered the retreat to Marcalt≈ë, then later to the Ih√°sz-farm. √úchtritz later declared that he didn't understood why Kmety retreated from the R√°ba-line without even trying to defend it. Kmety hoped that the reinforcements promised by Poeltenberg will arrive, so then he wanted to counterattack against the enemy. Poeltenberg received Kmety's letter which asked him to send reinforcements on 26 June, then sent, under the lead of Lieutenant-Colonel H√ºm√©r Kupa, the 51. battalion, 2. battalion of the 2. (S√°ndor) infantry regiment and four companies of the 16. (K√°rolyi) Hussar regiment, as well as a cavalry battery to T√©t. But when here, Kupa received on 27 June here the news about Kmety's retreat from the R√°ba-line, and Poeltenberg's order (who earlier was announced by Kmety about his retteart to Ih√°sz, and his plan to keep the enemy column which went towards Marcalt≈ë, preventing them to meet with the other imperial troops) to take position at M√©nf≈ë, because on 28 June at 10‚Äì11 in the morning the latter decided to attack with 14 cavalry companies, 6 battalions and 21 cannons, the advancing enemy, and force them to retreat to M√≥richida. General Gy√∂rgy Klapka's (the 2. in charge senior officer in the main army after G√∂rgei) chief of the general staff, Mayor P√©ter Szill√°ny ordered to Poeltenberg to position his troops between M√©nf≈ë, Kismegyer and Szabadhegy, and to stop the enemys advancement. Poeltenberg hoped that, during his troops attack at M√©nf≈ë against the advancing enemy, Kmety will prevent the enemy right wing to come to the aid of the troops planned to be attacked by him. Kmety indeed entered in battle with the Austrian Gerstner-brigade on 27 June, in the, what will be called Battle of Ih√°sz. =Battle of Ih√°sz= The Gerstner-brigade had around 5000 soldiers and an infantry battery with around six pounder 8 cannons, while the Hungarians had around the same number of soldiers with 15 cannons and 2 rockets. The Gerstner-brigade advanced in battle position from the bridgehead of V√°rkesz≈ë to the southern end of Marcalt≈ë in two columns. The first of these columns was composed by two battalions, while the other of three battalions, 6 cannons and two dragoon companies. Two battalions remained at the bridge of Marcalt≈ë, to guard it. Then the imperial brigade continued tis way towards Lesh√°za. Arriving on the heights from Lesh√°za, the Austrians saw Kmety's troops aligned to battle on the Ih√°sz-farm. Kmety positioned his troops in three lines. The first line was formed by the 33., 45. and 2. battalions, in their middle he put a cavalry battery, made of 6 cannons and two howitzers, and also two cannons from an infantry battery. These were guarded by four companies of the Vilmos Hussars. From here General Gy√∂rgy Kmety himself commanded his troops. The second line was formed by the 10 and 23 battalions. The wings were made of two companies of hussars (the N√°dor and the Vilmos- Hussars). The 3. line was the reserve: on the left wing were two companies of jaegers, a newly formed battalion, the 9. infantry battery and a half rocket battery. The Ih√°sz-farm was made of several houses. Kmety's opinion was that it was disadvantageous for a battle, so he claimed that he only accepted the battle to save his armies military honor. Brocky K√°roly Kmety Gy√∂rgy After the battle Kmety was criticised by his officer Emil √úchtritz, that he positioned his cavalry in a place where they could not charge with full speed, and that he had not deployed all his artillery against the enemy. He also claimed that he tried to convince Kmety about positioning the Hungarian troops 6,5‚Äì8 km ahead, to deploy the left wing around the Leh√°za-farm, where the terrain was suitable for the cavalry to operate, and to position the artillery behind the farm, thanks to which the Austrians could have been easily pushed in the river at Marcalt≈ë, or force them to surrender, but Kmety didn't listened him. The Austrian reports after the battle also noted that the Hungarians made a mistake by not using the Lesh√°za-farm as a tactical position. Instead of that the Landwehr-battalion of the Nugent-infantry, from the advance guard of the Austrian troops occupied the farm, without any opposition. The rest of the Austrian troops continued their advancement towards Ih√°sz, and after they arrived, they started to take position as it follows: In the first line on the left wing was the 3. battalion of the Welden-infantry, in the middle the 3. battalion of the Nugent-infantry, and in the right wing were four companies of the Landwehr-battalion of the Nugent-infantry, while on the edge, in the farm, two companies of the same unit. In the second line on the right wing was the 4. battalion of the Welden-infantry, in the middle the 19. Kaiserj√§ger- battalion. After a while these were sent in front of the Nugent-infantry, because the leader of the Austrian troops Lieutenant General Adolf Sch√ºtte Edler von Warensberg was not contented with the latters behavior on the battlefield. The two companies of the Ficquelmont-dragoons were positioned behind the infantry. Sch√ºtte ordered three cannons on the right and three on the left side of the road. The Hungarian artillery started its fire during the Austrian troops deployment, destroying one of their cannons, and causing important losses to their infantry. Sch√ºtte ordered his cannons to advance on the heights near the Lesh√°za-farm, and to start shooting from there. They caused some losses to the Hungarian infantry, but then tried to shoot where Kmety and his staff, the Hungarian general rising his hat every time when the enemies cannonballs missed their target. On the other hand, a Hungarian cannonball nearly killed the commander of the Welden-infantry, Lieutenant- Colonel Schneider, who fell off from his frightened horse, but then mounted again. Around 4 o'clock a Hungarian cavalry battery advanced, together with 6 companies of the Vilmos-hussars from the Hungarian right wing, to attack the 3. battalion of the Welden-infantry from the Austrian left wing. At that time also the 6 ponder infantry battery from the Hungarian left advanced, and caught in a crossfire the Austrian infantry. The cannons caused losses and disarray in the enemies infantry quadrangle, when a horse was killed by them, right in the moment when the Hungarian hussars were approaching. The Austrian officers managed with difficulty to rearrange the quadrangle in time. In the mean Sch√ºtte sent two companies of dragoons and a half of his infantry battery against the hussars. The half battery was hidden by a cornfield and behind a ditch, and let the hussars to approach to around 400 meters, then unleashed a heavy grape shot against them, killing 15 men a 34 horses. Lieutenant Jen≈ë Fekete was among the wounded, his leg was amputated afterwards. The hussars from the left wing also attacked, but they were halted by two companies of the Welden-infantry. At 6 o'clock Sch√ºtte ordered general attack, with the 3. battalion of the Welden-infantry and two dragoon companies on the left wing, the 19. Kaiserj√§ger-battalion in the middle and the 4. battalion of the Welden-infantry on the right wing. The Hungarian grapeshots caused 20 deaths among the advancing enemy and their horses. According to Lieutenant J√°nos Trsk√≥ the cannonballs shot by the Hungarian cavalry artillery swept streets in the dragoons mass. The Welden-infantrys 4. battalion and the 19. Kaiserj√§ger- battalion changed direction to left to catch the Hungarian troops from flank, but the Hungarian artillery's shots caused disarray among the 4. battalion. The Austrian officers intervened, reorganised the troops, and ordered attack against the Hungarian artillery, which quickly retreated from the battlefield. Seeing this, Kmety ordered the retreat, which was covered by 6 companies of the Vilmos-hussars and a cavalry battery. So ended the battle which lasted from around 3,45 o'clock until 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Today too the historians argue about Kmety's inexplicable retreat was not a coward commander, because he won two weeks earlier a victory in the Battle of Csorna. After the battle he wrote a short report in which he claimed that, he was preparing for a counterattack, when he suddenly saw an enemy column approaching from the flank and the back, threatening his troops with encirclement, this being the cause of his retreat. But he is contradicted by several Hungarian officers, who did not see anything. According to √úchtritz Kmety was informed that an enemy column was moving from S√°rv√°r to P√°pa, which could catch his troops in the middle. Among the causes of Kmety's retreat was that his troops had almost ran out of ammunition, and that some Hungarian cannons broke down because of the heavy firing. At the end of the action 5 of the 6 horses which were pulling the last cannon which was covering the Hungarian troops retreat, were killed by the enemy firing. An Austrian battalion wanted to take advantage from this situation, and to take possession of that cannon, but a Hungarian half battalion pushed them back with a bayonnet charge, being helped also by the grape shots shot by the cannon. With 3,5 km behind Ih√°sz, Kmety took position again, but seeing that nobody pursued them, he ordered his troops to retreat to P√°pa. According to Sch√ºtte too, the Hungarians retreated in order, so he did not tried to pursue them. According to Kmety the Hungarian losses were 24 dead, 88 wounded and 32 horses. Sch√ºtte wrote that the Hungarians let 30 wounded with an officer on the battlefield and that they carried with them many dead soldiers on many waggons. According to √úchtritz, the Hungarians had 87 deaths and 110 wounded. Another source tells about the loss of 5 officers and 105 soldiers. So we can conclude that the Hungarians lost at most around 200 dead and wounded soldiers. But despite theirvictory, the Austrian losses were heavier: 65 deaths, 162 wounded, 50 missing (in total 277) and 32 horses. As the most important result of this battle was that the nearly 5000 soldiers of the Kmety-division could not participate in the Battle of Gy≈ër on the next day, reducing General Poeltenbergs troops number, which he could use to 12 400, against the nearly 70 000 troops of Haynau. Lieutenant Colonel H√ºm√©r Kupa's two divisions, four Hussar companies and 1 cavalry battery did not reached in time to the battle of Ih√°sz, retreating to Szemere, where on 27 June, two infantry companies, cut off from Kmety's division joined them. Poeltenberg sent three infantry divisions, a Tiroler Kaiserj√§ger division and a half infantry battery of 6 ponder guns. Klapka too sent 4 hussar companies and a three pounder battery to Szabadhegy. These cavalry units arrived to Szemere, joining Kupa's troops.. Battle On 28 June at mourning the battle started among the units led by Lieutenant Colonel H√ºm√©r Kupa and the Austrian III. corps. Other enemy troops crossed the R√°ba river at Bab√≥t marching towards M√©nf≈ë, which forced the division led by Lieutenant Colonel Ferenc Liptay to retreat, in continuous fighting, to the positions between M√©nf≈ë and Csanak, in order not to be cut from the Hungarian troops which defended Gy≈ër.. Poeltenberg sent Liptay and important cavalry units, in order to secure Kupa's division from being cut from Gy≈ër by the enemy, but with this move, he weakened his defence around the city, and because of this he had insufficient troops to secure the Gy≈ër- Kismegyer-Nagymegyer-Nagybar√°ti line, which could have been a very good defensive position. Gy≈ër and its fortifications were too large for Poeltenberg's troops, this is why he decided to slowly retreat them. First he gave away the first defensive line which lied to West from Gy≈ër, and to retreat in the smaller second line. Then at 9 o'clock he charged Lieutenant Colonel S√°ndor Kossuth with the defence of the city, and then he rushed towards M√©nf≈ë. Kossuth had to dispose with his infantry division, the smaller part of the cavalry division, the reserve and the reinforcements sent by General Gy√∂rgy Klapka. Battle of Gy≈ër 28 June 1849 in a battle map collection from the 1850s On the enemy side, the IV (or reserve) corps led by Lieutenant- general Ludwig von Wohlgemuth tried unsuccessfully to cross the R√°ba by R√°bapatona. Then Haynau ordered him to attack Gy≈ër at its Vienna-suburb, bordered by the R√°ba and the R√°bca rivers. In the same time the I. corps led by Franz Schlik attacked, between the Little Danube and the R√°bca rivers, through Abda against Gy≈ërsziget (Gy≈ër island). The first Hungarian defensive position was at the bridge from Abda, from where, after a short fight, the Hungarians retreated, knowing that Wohlgemuth's troops could attack them from the rear after they occupied the Vienna-suburb. The Austrian I. and the IV. corps followed the retreating Hungarian troops from Abda. Battle of Gy≈ër on 28 June 1849. B. Bachmann-Hohmann 1850The emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria enters in Gy≈ër leading the Austrian troops. G√∂rgei departed from Tata at 28 June early in the morning, first to G≈ëny≈±, to observe the crossing from there, then he continued his way towards Gy≈ër. At Szentj√°nospuszta he met with the II. corps which was marching towards Gy≈ër, and ordered to J√≥zsef K√°szonyi to go towards Koronc√≥. When G√∂rgei arrived to Gy≈ër, he learned that the battle was already going strong, Poeltenberg already gave up the first defensive line West of the city, and that the main fights were around M√©nf≈ë. G√∂rgei went over there, and in the way he met Poeltenberg, and ordered him to turn back in the city, while he continued his way towards M√©nf≈ë, to take over the command of the troops from there. He knew that his troops could only keep Gy≈ër, if they can withstand to the enemy until the next day, when he expected the II. corps to arrive, and the key of holding Gy≈ër until then was to hold M√©nf≈ë at all costs. But even before he arrived there, he received Liptay's report that he cannot keep his position, and he is forced to retreat to Szabadhegy. In the meanwhile, at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, the imperials started their attack against the city of Gy≈ër. G√∂rgei knew that if Poeltenberg would try to hold on for a too long time, his troops could be encircled, so he ordered to the corps commander to retreat from Gy≈ër, and to retreat to the Galamb-tavern. At the same time he ordered to Liptay to retreat from Szabadhegy to Hecsepuszta.. After they occupied the bridge from Abda, the Bianchi-brigade of the imperial troops advanced towards Gy≈ërsziget, while the Sartori-brigade against the Vienna suburb. Right to them the Benedek-brigade was advancing. Franz Schlik took over the leadership of the troops which attacked the Vienna-suburb, concentrating 42 cannons in this region, and ordered them to shoot the Hungarian positions for two hours. The Hungarians lost 4 carriages with ammunition, but resisted the attacks. Battle of Gy≈ër 28 June 1848 by Vinzenz Katzler. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria enters in Gy≈ër leading the Austrian troops. In the region between the R√°bca and the Little Danube Haynau's troops were more successful. The Bianchi-brigade led in person by Prince Franz de Paula of Liechtenstein entered in the Sziget-suburb of Gy≈ër through the F√°c√°nos woods by Pinny√©d, crossed the R√°bca river, and attacked the rear of the Hungarian troops defending the Vienna-suburb. In the same time the Reischach-brigade occupied R√©vfalu and restored the Danube bridge towards Moson. Among the imperial troops entering Gy≈ër, was also the young emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Because of the Austrian successes, the Hungarian troops led by S√°ndor Kossuth which were defending Gy≈ër, became threatened by an imminent enemy encirclement. Because of this, G√∂rgei and Poeltenbeg ordered to the troops to retreat from Gy≈ër at 4,30 PM, which was started at 5 o'clock, without being pursued in a determined way by the enemy troops. The commander of the defence troops, Lieutenant Colonel S√°ndor Kossuth was among the last Hungarians to leave the town, and when he was finally leaving Gy≈ër together with his adjutant, they \\"bumped into\\" the advancing Austrian infantry which started to shoot in them, but missed. Kossuth stopped his horse and shouted to them in German:  Tell to your commander, that my name is Kossuth, today I am the last who live his town, but tomorrow I will be the first who will enter in it again!  Yeah, right... - answered one soldier. Then S√°ndor Kossuth turned aside in his saddle, hit his right thigh with his palm, and responded:  So then shoot here, you crook! A soldier, whose weapon was loaded, shoot him right in that place. Kossuth then rode away, without noticing that he is wounded. S√°ndor Kossuth met G√∂rgei at the Galamb-tavern, where the Hungarian troops had to retreat if they were forced to do that, where the high commander told him:  Go and [tell the medics to bandage] your wound, S√°ndor, because you are wounded.  Gosh, the crook really hit [my thigh, right] where I told him to shoot. G√∂rgei ordered that if the enemy would try to advance towards V√©nek in the Szigetk√∂z, the Hungarian troops to hold them. At 6 o'clock General Gy√∂rgy Klapka arrived on the battlefield, right when G√∂rgei was arranging the troops which were newly retreated from Gy≈ër. Then G√∂rgei entrusted Klapka to lead the Liptay-division and the other Hungarian units which joined them to Szentj√°nospuszta, to build there a camp, than next day to retreat to √Åcs, then on 30, to the fortified camp from Kom√°rom. Then he ordered to Poeltenberg to move with the infantry and artillery of the right wing to march to G√∂ny≈±. Then G√∂rgei, with the cavalry of the VII. corps and a cavalry battery covered his troops retreat. G√∂rgey Art√∫r G√∂rgei knew that he charged himself with the most difficult and very dangerous duty, but he fulfilled it with full success. When, after 1850 he dictated his memories about his activity in the Hungarian Freedom War to his brother, Istv√°n G√∂rgey, he told to the latter about what he taught and felt where he was on the lead of the Hungarian hussars, covering his troops retreat: In that moment the danger appeared in a so huge shape, and the subofficers which were presents there, were so insufficient, that I decided to spare no effort in order to make possible and assure the simple, unperturbed retreat of the exhausted infantry by personally leading to attack all the cavalry which was available [in that moment], forcing them to fight with all the force which they had... And then I opened my snuff box, broke down my wife's daguerreotype framed under the glass, and wiped it down from the sheet. The gentlemen which were commanding my divisions, walked cozily to G√∂ny≈± and to Szentj√°nos, and saw that the enemy does not even bothering them, forgetting to think that with only three regiments of hussars I resist for hours to an enemy numbering 66 000 [soldiers], which were drunk of glory, and wishing to achieve a new victory, at Szabadhegy. If then, by chance, I would had been wiped out by a bullet, or killed by a sword, [people] would had been said at most: its pitty that he put himself in front of danger without any reason. A military commander who selfishly pursues ambitious goals, would not put himself in front of such dangerous, but obscure rearguard fights, in which the achievable public glory is determined by the lesser involvement in them.G√∂rgey Art√∫r / √âletem √©s m≈±k√∂d√©sem Magyarorsz√°gon 1848-ban √©s 1849-ben, G√∂rgey Istv√°n ford√≠t√°s√°t √°tdolgozta, a bevezet≈ët √©s a jegyzeteket √≠rta Katona Tam√°s, Budapest : Neumann Kht., 2004 Thanks to his heroical fight in the lead of the hussars, G√∂rgei managed to save his army. Poeltenberg's performance in leading the retreat of the infantry and artillery was also worth to be mentioned. In this battle the Austrian main commander, Julius von Haynau and his chief of the general staff, Colonel Wilhelm Ramming put up a good performance in managing to surprise the Hungarian defence of Gy≈ër, but despite their huge numerical superiority, the fact that the Austro-Russian army took control over Gy≈ër, and that they gained the initiative in the war, they could not cause neither the destruction of the Hungarian army, nor cause important losses to it.. Aftermath After the battle Haynau's troops followed the retreating Hungarians until Kom√°rom, and the Austrian commander decided to start a new attack on 2 July, in order to force G√∂rgei's troops to retreat in the fortress, opening with this his road to Budapest.. Except of losing an important city, the military consequences were not very severe for the Hungarians. But soon the situation worsened because of other, mostly political, reasons. When Lajos Kossuth first learned about the defeat, he did not considered the situation very grave for the Hungarian cause. But soon, after reading the letters of the governments commissioner J√°nos Ludvigh who tried to convince him and the government, to live Pest, arguing that the enemy could occupy the capitals very soon, and hearing the news sent by General J√≥zef Wysocki that the Russian troops occupied Miskolc, he gathered the ministry council, and in the absence of Art√∫r G√∂rgei (the ministry of war), they changed the decision of the ministry council from 26 June, by concluding to live the Hungarian capitals, ordering to G√∂rgei to retreat with the main Hungarian army from Kom√°rom to and move to Southern Hungary following the government.. G√∂rgei although he considered this decision a huge mistake, he consented, promising that he will depart with his troops towards the designated location at 3 July. But despite of this, soon a regrettable misunderstanding between Kossuth and G√∂rgei brought the Hungarian military situation near to a tragic turning point. On 30 June G√∂rgei sent two letters to Kossuth, which he red in reverse order, and because of this he taught that G√∂rgei disobeyed him. So he decided to dismiss G√∂rgei from the command of the main Hungarian army, and to put in his place Lieutenant General L√°z√°r M√©sz√°ros, a very untalented military commander, who had lost all his battles until then. On 2. July 1849, M√©sz√°ros was, on a steamboat on his way to Kom√°rom with the order of replacement in his pocket, when he heard the sound of the gunfire of the second battle of Kom√°rom, which was in progress. So luckily he could not play a role in this very important battle in which G√∂rgei performed miracles against Haynau's twice bigger army, forcing them to retreat.G√∂rgey Art√∫r / √âletem √©s m≈±k√∂d√©sem Magyarorsz√°gon 1848-ban √©s 1849-ben, G√∂rgey Istv√°n ford√≠t√°s√°t √°tdolgozta, a bevezet≈ët √©s a jegyzeteket √≠rta Katona Tam√°s, Budapest : Neumann Kht., 2004 References Sources    * Gy≈ër Gy≈ër Gy≈ër Category:Conflicts in 1849 ","title":"Battle of Gy≈ër"},{"id":"58566468","text":"Stadionul Cri»ôul is a multi-purpose stadium in Chi»ôineu-Cri»ô, Romania.

Partnerships and donors allow for more than 71,000 people to be fed each week through different programs. Northern Illinois Food Bank operates in 13 counties surrounding Chicago. The organization has four distribution centers located in Geneva, Rockford, Park City, and Joliet, which distribute food to pantries who then allocate the food to people.  History  In 1982, Sister Rosemarie Burian decided to create a food bank out of DuPage County, Illinois. In 1983 she opened the Bethlehem Center, now known as the Northern Illinois Food Bank. Nearly 64,000 pounds of food were allocated among 80 different food pantries during Bethlehem Center's first year of operation. By 1985 the center serviced over 100 food pantries in DuPage, Will, Kane, and McHenry counties in Northern Illinois. In 1992, Northern Illinois Food Bank became a certified affiliate of Feeding America, the nation's food bank network. In October 2001, they opened their second distribution center in Park City. The third distribution center was opened in Rockford in 2005. By 2008, they were distributing 22 million pounds of food. In 2011, they had more than 600 partners organizations placing orders and 36 million pounds of food were distributed. Their fourth distribution center opened in 2018, in Joliet. Julie Yurko was name President and CEO of the food bank in 2014.  Partnerships  Donations come from food corporations and from grocery stores who give slightly damaged and unsellable goods. In 2007, they started working with Sam's Club and in that year alone they donated 1 million pounds of food. In 2009, Walmart donated 40 refrigerated trucks and Northern Illinois Food Bank managed to get one of them. In 2010, Highland Park Hospital donated $10,000. Jewel-Osco has donated food to the Northern Illinois Food Bank since the late 1980s. In 2017, Jewel- Osco's Bensenville location donated 38,000 cans of garbanzo beans to the food bank which helped provide an estimated 35,000 meals to those in need. In the same year they donated 14 million pounds of food, and in 2018, Jewel-Osco partnered with Hormel Foods and donated 33,122 jars of peanut butter, enough to make 500,000 sandwiches. In 2016, Tyson Foods donated 108,049 pounds of protein to the food bank. Donations not only come from food corporations, other organizations donate money as well, such as the MetLife Foundation that gave the food bank a $25,000 grant in 2011, enough to provide 150,000 meals. In 2017, the food bank partnered with employees at Partners Warehouse and Elwood Fire Department to provide 260 boxes of food to 2,000 people right before the American holiday season.  Distribution Centers  Northern Illinois Food Bank has four distribution centers. They are located in Geneva, Loves Park, Park City, and Joliet. The West Suburban Center (Geneva) is the largest with 147,000 square feet and provides 5.5 million meals a day in 13 counties outside Cook County.

The junta was officially dissolved in 2011 into a civilian government, but there are lasting effects from the decades of military rule. Currently, the income gap in Myanmar is one of the largest in the world, and there are claims that many members of the previous regime continue to hold positions of power. In 2012, U.N. Special Rapporteur Tomas Ojea Quintana called on the creation of a truth commission by Myanmar to look into the human rights abuses committed by the previous government's rule. Quintana also called for an \\"independent and credible investigation\\" into the conflict between the Rakhine Buddhists and the Rohingya Muslim minority. In 2015, the Network for Human Rights Documentation Burma (ND-Burma) came out with a report that called for the acknowledgement and reparation for both crimes committed under the military junta, and the abuses currently ongoing.  Background  = Military rule (1962‚Äì2010) = The military rule in Myanmar was established by a coup d‚Äô√©tat in 1962, replacing the civilian government that had been in power since Burmese independence in 1948. The country was ruled by martial law for the following twelve years until the constitution of 1974, at which point the government became a civilian-military hybrid. The military once again took full control of the government in 1988 and retained it until 2011. There were a few protests throughout the early years of military rule, all of which were suppressed through force. In 1988, protests in favour of democracy known as the 8888 Uprising spread through the nation and thousands of protesters were killed in an attempt to stamp it out. General Saw Maung then staged another coup d'√©tat and implemented a period of martial law. In 2007, the rise in prices diesel and petrol prices resulted in the Saffron Revolution, which was once more violently suppressed by the government with the reported killing of many unarmed monks who were leading the protest. = Rohingya crisis = Under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law, Rohingya people are legally denied citizenship and do not have a path to gain it. With this lack of citizenship they also are denied freedom of movement and face difficulty finding access to medical care, jobs, and education. In late 2016, Burmese police and armed forces began a suppression of the Rohingya people who reside in the northwestern Rakhine State after an attack on several police border posts in October left several dead. The following crackdown involved \\"unlawful killings, multiple rapes and the burning down of houses and entire villages\\" all targeted against the Rohingya people. A refugee crisis was sparked by this persecution, with many Rohingya crossing into bordering nations. It is estimated that between August and December 2017, 625 000 refugees fled from Rakhine into Bangladesh.  International response  The previous UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, described the military crackdown against the Rohingya people as \\"a textbook example of ethnic cleansing\\" and claimed it may constitute genocide. British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed with the description of ethnic cleansing, and French President Emmanuel Macron described it as genocide. Many governments committed to monetary amounts for aid for the Rohingya, including the Japanese, Canadian, and Australian governments. Others, such as the Indonesian and Malaysian governments, have sent planes full of relief supplies to the Rohingya camps. In September 2018, the Canadian parliament unanimously voted to revoke the honorary Canadian citizenship from Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi as a response to the ongoing human rights violations against the Rohingya.  Calls for transitional justice  With the Rohingya crisis still ongoing, most calls for transitional justice and reconciliation in Myanmar are in regards to the previous military government. Asia Justice and Rights (AJAR) believes that the rapid amount of change occurring in Myanmar provides opportunity for a positive shift in regards to rule of law and human rights. AJAR is also currently working with victims and developing initiatives in Myanmar to prevent mass torture and bring accountability for torture that took place in the past. Even before the dissolution of the military junta in 2011, there was discussion amongst activists about the use of transitional justice to usher in a smoother transition to democracy. A system of qualified amnesty was suggested as incentive for officials to agree to this process of transitional justice. One report concedes that although transitional justice may not be possible at this moment in time, \\"now is the time to start laying robust foundations by boosting data gathering and promoting popular awareness\\". In July 2018, Myanmar created a commission of inquiry to investigate the alleged abuses against the Rohingya. The panel is composed of two local and two international commissioners. Human Rights Watch has raised doubts about the possible outcome of this commission, citing the fact that one of the local commissioners (Aung Tun Thet) has previously denied the existence of any ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. The chairwoman of the commission, Rosario Manalo of the Philippines, also created some concern about the inquiry for those hoping for accountability when she stated there would be \\"no blaming of anybody\\". Amnesty International released a report in June 2018 that documents numerous human rights abuses, and proceeded to call for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC). On 27 September 2018, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to create an international body to \\"help prepare case files for future criminal proceedings\\". This resolution was the result of a UN fact finding mission that discovered numerous human rights abuses under the military junta, and currently ongoing against the Rohingya.

The Madonna della Clemenza, or Icon of the Virgin and Child as it is also known, is located at the Basilica Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome, Italy. The origins of the painting are debated among scholars, but it is most often attributed to a commission by Pope John VII. The Madonna della Clemenza is one of the five oldest existing Marian Icons from the medieval period. Its proximity to the rise of Christianity is one of the reasons it was believed to be a divine image. It is the largest of the five at 64.5in by 45.5 in. Description In the painting, Mary is depicted in the \\"Regina Coeli,\\" style unique to Rome in late antiquity. In this and many other early icons, Mary is formulated in the Maesta style. Maesta is a popular style for Marian iconography in which Mary is depicted as the Queen of heaven, in regal style seated on a throne and complete with a crown covered in pearls. The Christ Child is dressed in purple robes similar to Mary's which were once covered in gold. Both Mary and Christ have golden halos. Mary is seated cradling the Christ child in one arm, and holding a cross staff in the other. This style of Mary holding Christ is unique, as the usual style is Mary holding Christ in the crook of her arm, but with this Icon, Christ is placed on Mary's lap with her arm placed just in front of him. History It one of the first known donor portraits. Although the painting is badly worn, kneeling at the feet of the Virgin Mother is an image of what is believed to be Pope John VII. In 1593, during the Counter-Reformation, the Icon was reframed and placed on the central Capella Altemps inside the Basilica Santa Maria di Trastevere as a means to display the power of this Marian cult image. The idea behind the re-framing, was that if you framed an Icon, it would be transformed from a divine object into a piece of art, thereby removing the stigma of it being considered a false idol. In 1988, there was an exhibition held at the Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. All five of the oldest Marian Icons were represented, however, the representation of the Madonna della Clemenza was not the original but a photographic copy due to the delicate state of the original painting. The Icon can still be seen over the Capella Altemps in the Basilica Santa Maria di Trastevere in Rome.

She is a world-leading expert on Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a species of predatory bacteria.  Early life and education  Sockett was born in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1962 and completed her Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry at the University of Leeds in 1983. She moved to University College London (UCL) for her postgraduate study, and was awarded a PhD in 1986 for research on the biochemistry of motility and taxis in purple bacteria.  Career and research  After completing her PhD, Sockett worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (1986-1988) and then the University of Oxford (1988-1990). In 1991, she was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Nottingham and subsequently promoted to senior lecturer in 2001, Reader in 2004 and Professor in 2005. Her research group started by studying the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Her interests in bacterial physiology and mechanisms then turned to understanding the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. Bdellovibrio preys upon a wide range of bacteria including antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are harmful to human health. Sockett's lab have studied the genome of Bdellovibrio during the invasion of other bacteria. Her group has identified several Bdellovibrio genes that make enzymes which break down important structural components of bacteria, and also secrete enzymes that break down chromosomes. She is studying the application of predatory bacteria like Bdellovibrio to treat antimicrobial-resistant infections. Sockett's group worked together with Alexandra Willis and her PhD supervisor at Imperial College London to study Bdellovibrio predation in a zebrafish infection model. Zebrafish infected with a lethal dose of the antibiotic-resistant human pathogen Shigella flexneri were given Bdellovibrio as a treatment. Together, the researchers showed that Bdellovibrio could kill the Shigella, working synergistically with the zebrafishs' own immune system to promote zebrafish survival. Sockett and her group collaborated with Erkin Kuru at Indiana University Bloomington, using fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) to illuminate the mechanisms by which Bdellovibrio invades its prey. They discovered that Bdellovibrio forms a small reinforced 'porthole' in the cell wall of its prey through which it squeezes and then re-seals from the inside . She also has long-standing collaborations with Andrew Lovering at the University of Birmingham, who studies the structural biology of predatory Bdellovibrio enzymes, and Waldemar Vollmer at Newcastle University, who studies the structure of bacterial cell walls. As part of a Human Frontier Science Program grant, Sockett collaborated with Shin-Ichi Aizawa to study the Bdellovibrio interaction with Escherichia coli. Her strains appeared in electron microscope images in the 2013 book The Flagellar World. Her research has been funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Medical Research Council (MRC), Leverhulme Trust and the Wellcome Trust. Sockett is a communicator and role model for careers in microbiology, which was recognised by the award of the Peter Wildy prize of the Society for General Microbiology in 2006, where her prize lecture was entitled Not Just Germs - Bringing Bacteria to Life. Socket is an advocate for public engagement and science outreach. = Awards and honours= Sockett was interviewed on The Life Scientific by Jim Al-Khalili in 2017.

Sold very cheaply as a foal, he was a slow-maturing stayer who showed unremarkable form in his first four seasons and took fourteen attempts to win his first race. As a six-year-old in 2005 he made rapid improvement and completed a unique treble in handicap races when he won the Northumberland Plate, Ebor Handicap and Cesarewitch Handicap. In the following year he made a successful transition to weight-for-age races, taking the Lonsdale Cup, Doncaster Cup and Prix du Cadran. He was never as good again, but recorded a final major victory in the 2007 Yorkshire Cup. He was an example of a \\"hold up\\" horse who typically dropped to the back of the field before coming with a late charge in the closing stages. Background Sergeant Cecil was a chestnut with a white blaze and four white socks horse bred in Dorset by Don Hazzard. When the foal was six months old he was purchased privately by Terry Cooper for ¬£1,000 with a further ¬£400 to be paid if he won two races. Cooper named the horse after his father, Sergeant Cecil Edward Cooper. The colt was gelded and sent into training with Seamus Mullins. The trainer's stable groom Lou Griffin remembered him as \\"very cheeky, never nasty, but very cocksure, very much the big I am... He was always doing something you‚Äôd want to stop him doing\\". He was the most successful racehorse sired by King's Signet, a sprinter who recorded his biggest win in the Stewards' Cup. Sergeant Cecil's dam Jadidh was a durable mare who contested 66 races and won seven times over hurdles. She was descended from Rockfoil, a half-sister to Rockfel. Racing career =Early career= Sergeant Cecil ran twice as juvenile in 2001, and showed no racing ability as he finished unplaced in maiden races at Kempton Park Racecourse on 24 September and Bath Racecourse a week later, starting at odds of 100/1 on both occasions. In the following year the gelding failed to make any impression in his first four races, running unplaced in minor staying events. After being transferred to the Devon stable of Rod Millman in late summer he showed some improvement without managing to win a race as he ran second twice and third once in his remaining five starts of the season. In 2003 the gelding made steady progress and recorded his first success at his fourteenth attempt when he took a minor handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Sandown Park on 27 May. In similar events over the same course and distance he ran second on 14 June and then won again on 4 July. He was beaten on his three subsequent starts but showed good form when finishing second in the stayers' race at the Shergar Cup. As a five-year-old Sergeant Cecil continued to show solid, but unremarkable form in handicaps. He was placed in competitive events at Goodwood, Doncaster Racecourse and Haydock Park but his only success came over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse on 9 July. =2005: six-year-old season= Alan Munro, who was returning to England after several years riding in Hong Kong, took over as Sergeant Cecil's jockey in 2005. The gelding began his season in middle-distance handicaps, finishing unplaced at Epsom in April, running second at Newbury in May and taking third place at Epsom on 4 June. Three weeks later he carried a weight of 120 pounds in the Northumberland Plate over two miles at Newcastle Racecourse and started at odds of 14/1 in a twenty-runner field. He was restrained by Munro in the early stages but began to make rapid progress on the inside rail in the straight. He \\"weaved\\" his way through the field, overtook the front-running Tungsten Strike inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths. After finishing third in a handicap at Goodwood Racecourse in July, Sergeant Cecil was one of twenty horses to contest the Ebor Handicap over one and three quarter miles at York on 17 August when he carried 124 pounds and started at odds of 11/1. In a repeat of the tactics employed at Newcastle, he came from well of the pace, \\"squeezed\\" though a narrow gap in the straight and won by a length from the top weight Carte Diamond. Alan Munro said Munro said: \\"We had a good run today. It took me a while to get in early but once I did they went a real steady pace and that really helped. He has got a great turn of foot and got there when he needed to\\". In September Sergeant Cecil was moved up in class for the Group 2 Doncaster Cup and finished second of the seven runners behind Millenary. On his final run of the year, the gelding carried top weight of 134 pounds in the Cesarewitch over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 October and started at 10/1 against 33 opponents. As in his two previous major wins he produced a strong late run in the last quarter mile after being held up by Munro for most of the race. He gained the advantage in the final strides and won by a length from King Revo, becoming the first horse to win the Northumberland Plate, Ebor and Cesarewitch in the same year. Millman commented \\"He needs a confident jockey on him and that's what Alan is\\", while Munro said \\"I owe Rod a lot. He was the first to help me out when I came back, so it's brilliant to pay him back\\". =2006: seven-year-old season= In 2006 Sergeant Cecil eschewed handicap competition and was campaigned excluively in weight- for-age races. He began his campaign by coming home fourth behind Mubtaker in the John Porter Stakes at Newbury in April and then ran second to Percussionist in the Yorkshire Cup in May. In the Ascot Gold Cup in June he came home fourth behind Yeats and was then dropped in class for the Listed Esher Stakes at Sandown in July, a race in which he started the 5/6 favourite but was beaten a neck by Land 'n Stars. On 3 August he ran fourth behind Yeats, Geordieland and Tungsten Strike in the Goodwood Cup after struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight. Frankie Dettori took over the ride from Munro when the gelding contested the Lonsdale Cup at York nineteen days later and was made the 11/4 favourite against ten opponents including Tungsten Strike, Franklins Gardens (2005 Yorkshire Cup), Kasthari (Doncaster Cup) and The Whistling Teal (Ormonde Stakes). After racing towards the rear of the field, Sergeant Cecil produced his customary late run, gained the advantage in the last hundred yards, and won by half a length from Franklins Gardens. Dettori was again in the saddle on 8 September when Sergeant Cecil started favourite for the \\"Doncaster Cup\\", which was run that year at York. Tungsten Strike and Kasthari were again in opposition while the best fancied of the other five runners where the eleven-year old Alcazar (Prix Royal-Oak) and the Irish mare Clara Allen. Sergeant Cecil came from the rear of the field to take the lead approaching the final furlong and won by a length from Alcazar. Rod Millman said \\"The horse is a privilege to be involved with. He's just a great credit to the team, I‚Äôm just the front man\\" while Dettori added \\"This horse hasn‚Äôt stopped surprising people and he's become a household name. He doesn‚Äôt know how to run a bad race and he's always there for you\\". On 1 October the gelding was sent to France and was made the 2/1 favourite for the Group 1 Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was faced by six opponents including Alcazar, Reefscape (winner of the race in 2005), Le Miracle (Prix Gladiateur) and Shamdala (Gran Premio di Milano). Sergeant Cecil turned into the straight in sixth place and overcame trouble in running before overhauling the leader Shamdala in the last 200 metres and winning by three- quarters of a length. His victory was enthusiastically received and he was described as \\"Britain's most popular horse\\". Three weeks later Sergeant Cecil returned to Longchamp for the Prix Royal Oak and finished strongly to take third place behind the four-year-olds Montare and Bellamy Cay. =Later career= As in the previous year, Sergeant Cecil began his 2007 campaign in April by finishing fourth in the John Porter Stakes before contesting the Yorkshire Cup in May. He was ridden by Jimmy Fortune at York and started the 100/30 favourite in a ten-runner field which included Munsef (King George V Stakes), The Last Drop (runner-up in the St Leger), Allegretto, Geordieland (Grand Prix de Chantilly) and Percussionist. After racing towards the rear as usual, Sergeant Cecil came with a late rush, gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Geordieland. Sergeant Cecil made no impact in his three remaining races that year. He finished tailed-off in last place behind Yeats in the Ascot Gold Cup, sixth of seven behind Dylan Thomas in an ambitious bid for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and fifth to Septimus when attempting to repeat his 2006 victory in the Lonsdale Cup. He missed the rest of the season after contracting a \\"nasty lung infection\\". Sergeant Cecil remained in training as a nine-year-old but was unable to recover his best form, running unplaced in the John Porter Stakes, Yorkshire Cup and Henry II Stakes. After finishing last of eight behind Yeats in the Goodwood Cup on 3 August he was retired from racing. Terry Cooper commented He was not just the horse of a lifetime but of a dozen lifetimes ‚Äì he has been absolutely fantastic and it has been a privilege to own him. Cecil has taken me to places I never thought I would go to and has enabled me to meet people I would never have met. As a horse he is a real gentleman with a lovely temperament and a sound constitution\\". Retirement After his retirement from racing Sergeant Cecil was sent for re-training as a dressage horse and was then used as a mount for the trainee jockeys at a riding school but failed to settle in either task. He was returned to Terry Cooper's property and was reported in 2017 to be enjoying a \\"sprightly\\" retirement.

Cherry stated at the 2019 Television Critics Association that there will be \\"three deaths at the end of the series, and they will all be committed by women. But it's not necessarily the three women on this stage. The victims are not necessarily the men on this stage, and interesting enough, not one person will be killed because of infidelity. Infidelity is just the starting point for these journeys of self‚Äëdiscovery.\\" On October 16, 2019, the day before the season 1 finale, it was announced that the series was renewed for a second season that would focus on a new set of characters.

Why Women Kill: Truth, Lies and Labels On September 20, 2019, CBS All Access released the first episode of a six episode podcast, entitled Why Women Kill: Truth, Lies and Labels, to help advertise for Why Women Kill. The final episode was released on October 25. Each episode, released weekly on Friday, shared the details of a woman who became a murderer. The podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and Stitcher Radio. Tori Telfer, a true crime writer, narrated each episode. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 67% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though Why Women Kill falls short of its ambitious premise, fans of Marc Cherry and his impressive cast will find much to like it its darkly soapy and stylish delights.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". While the aesthetic of the series received praise, critics found that Why Women Kill lacked character development. Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"We're supposed to marvel at the changing roles of women over time, but it's hard to get there, intellectually, when none of the three leads feels like a semblance of a real person. Instead, Why Women Kill comes off as an ungainly fantasy of women's emotional lives, where the threat of infidelity could be the only fuel of marital unhappiness.\\" Vulture reviewer Angelica Jade Basti√©n agreed with the focus on aesthetics more than plot, stating, \\"Why Women Kill is akin to an overly complicated craft cocktail, boasting an intriguing brightness, namely in the form of Goodwin's performance, but lacking balance in its competing flavors. It's full of baffling tonal and narrative decisions that undermine what does work about the show‚Äîa handful of the performances, the over-the-top, nearly camp production design, the costuming‚Äîand undercuts its dramatic potential with broad, nearly slapstick humor that distances us from the characters rather than illuminating who they are.\\" However, Greg Wheeler of ‚ÄòThe Review Geek‚Äô changed his view as the series progressed, and gave this favourable summary: ‚ÄòWhy Women Kill is one of those shows that‚Äôs hurt by early reviews. I‚Äôve said it many times before that a full season review rating should be reserved for just that ‚Äì a full season. When it comes to this wonderful drama, this is a perfect example against judging a show by the first few episodes. What began as an artistic trio of stories dancing around a singular idea, quickly blossomed into one of the best shows of the year. Between the strong writing and well paced segments, right across to the different themes and ideas explored each episode, Why Women Kill may just be one of my favourite shows of the year, balancing the artistic juxtapositions and smart editing with the perfect finale to balance things out.‚Äò References External links  Category:2010s American black comedy television series Category:2010s American comedy-drama television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related drama television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:Adultery in television Category:CBS All Access original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television series set in 1963 Category:Television series set in 1984 Category:Television series set in 2019 Category:Television shows set in Pasadena, California Category:Polyamory in fiction ","title":"Why Women Kill"},{"id":"58567234","text":"David James (16 November 1899 ‚Äì after 1929) was a Welsh professional footballer who made 201 appearances in the Football League playing as a half back or forward for Aberdare Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion.

Four of her family members became ill and could not access medical care in a hospital. She improvised a \\"trash bag method\\" that would allow her to care for her family members without becoming ill herself. Three of her family members survived the epidemic, and Kekula herself did not contract the virus. The trash bag method has been recognized as a relatively simple and accessible way for people to protect themselves in an epidemic if they cannot get treatment in a hospital. Ebola outbreak On 27 July 2014, Fatu Kekula's father, Moses, became ill and was taken to a local hospital in Kakata, Liberia. Unknown to the family, the hospital bed he was given had just been used by someone who died of Ebola. After hospital staff began contracting the disease, the hospital shut down; Kekula attempted to take her father to a hospital in Monrovia, but they were all at capacity. Kekula took him home, where three other family members became ill: Kekula's mother, Victoria, her sister, Vivian, and her cousin, Alfred Winnie. At the time, she was in her final year of study to become a nurse. Doctors would not come to her house due to the contagion risk, but one did advise Kekula over the phone. Some doctors told her to leave her family and not go \\"anywhere near them,\\" however, she said that she could not have done this because \\"your family is your family.\\" Kekula quarantined her sick family members in a makeshift isolation rooman unfinished room outside the house. She was able to start IV lines to administer drugs she purchased from a local clinic. She also treated them with oral rehydration therapy. Kekula did not have access to standard personal protective equipment from the highly-contagious disease, so to care for her sick family members, she improvised a new method. Her method has been called the \\"trash bag method.\\" It involved placing trash bags over her socks and tying them off at the calf. She would then put on rubber boots, over which she added another layer of trash bags. She also wrapped her hair in a trash bag. She also wore a raincoat, a surgical mask, and four gloves on each hand. After each bout of caring for her sick family members, she would carefully remove her gear and spray herself with chlorinated water. She would then burn the contaminated equipment. Her weeks of caring for her sick family led her to use four boxes of surgical gloves, as well as several bags of raincoats. On August 17, Kekula's four family members were taken to a hospital when space became available. Her cousin died the following day, while her mother, father, and sister all recovered. Her success rate (75%) was noted to be much higher than the average success rate in Liberia during the outbreak (30%). After the outbreak Kekula received donations from around the world so that she would be able to complete her nursing degree. She was accepted into the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. An Associate Dean at Emory University stated, \\"What better place than Emory to train a nurse who will return to the front lines of the fight against Ebola? And what a great opportunity for our current students to be able to study alongside someone who has faced a crisis that threatened her country, her own family and herself? It‚Äôs a perfect match.\\" She was particularly interested in learning more about caring for burn injuries, as Liberian children sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking. Impact Workers from international aid organizations learned about Kekula's \\"trash bag method\\" and began teaching it to other people in West Africa who did not have the means or ability to make it to a hospital.

The native village site includes a burial ground that is believed to contain the remains of the last Pootatuck sachem, Manquash.

Casa de Santa Maria in Cascais, was designed by Raul Lino in 1902. Summer architecture (') was a Portuguese architectural movement originating in the Portuguese Riviera, in late 19th and early 20th century, when the region became a popular resort destination for the Portuguese Royal Family and the Portuguese aristocracy. The movement is not characterized by any single architectural style or artistic school, but rather unified by common themes, including leisure, wellness, exoticism, and heterotopia. The Portuguese Riviera, the coastal region west of the capital Lisbon centered on the cities of Cascais, Sintra, and Oeiras, became a resort destination in the 1870s when King Lu√≠s I of Portugal began spending his summers at the Pal√°cio da Cidadela in Cascais. A development boom ensued along the coast, accompanied by the construction of the Cascais railway and the Sintra railway, resulting in the construction of palaces, estates, and chalets of Lisbon's aristocracy for use in the summer. The movement's proliferation in the Portuguese Riviera influenced architectural and stylistic tastes across Portugal's other coastal regions, namely Figueira da Foz and Foz do Douro.  History  The Pal√°cio dos Condes de Castro Guimar√£es in Cascais Casa Lencastre was built in 1898 Sea bathing was already becoming popular in Portugal in the mid-1850s. Cascais, with its protected beaches, was attracting tourists from the capital, Lisbon, and the numbers increased considerably following the opening of a road to the capital in 1863 and the commencement of a stagecoach service. Further stimulus for people to visit Cascais came as a result of the first visit to the town by Queen Maria Pia in September 1867 and the completion of a road from Sintra to Cascais in 1868. Sintra, situated in hills and therefore cooler in the summer, was a popular summer retreat for the Royal Family and the nobility of Lisbon. Following renovation of the house of the Governor of the Cascais Citadel, the Royal Family stayed there for several weeks in 1870 and did so in subsequent years. It rapidly became normal for the nobility to leave Sintra and transfer to Cascais in early to mid-September in order to be close to the King. However, the quality of hotels in the town was considered poor and noble families began to construct their own homes, beginning with the Duke of Palmela and the Duke of Loul√©. In time, rich businessmen also built summer houses, including Jorge O'Neil, a tobacco baron, and Henrique de Sommer, who became Portugal's leading cement producer. Estoril would later become a royal retreat for members of the Spanish Royal Family, Italian Royal Family, French Royal Family, Austrian Imperial Family, and numerous other royal and noble families from across Europe between the World Wars.  Styles  Palmela Palace, built in 1874 Estoril's Chalet Barros, also known as Forte da Cruz, built in 1894. In design the new houses were rather different from the houses owned by the nobility in Lisbon, and came to be referred to as summer architecture. They were eclectic, both in their individual designs and in the wide range of architectural styles chosen by the owners, and aimed for a high level of external decoration. Architects used included Thomas Henry Wyatt from England and the Portuguese Raul Lino, who designed around 700 projects in his lifetime and developed the idealized concept of A Casa Portuguesa or the Portuguese House. Styles used included Italianate, Swiss chalet style, English Gothic, Louis XIII style, and neoclassical. The Pal√°cio do Conde de Castro Guimar√£es used a Revivalist approach that included Neo-romanticism, Neo- Gothic, Neo-Manueline and Neo-Moorish styles. Following the overthrow of the monarchy in 1910, there was not the same imperative for affluent citizens of Lisbon to be in Cascais every September. Nevertheless, the building of exotic summer houses continued and extended to neighbouring Estoril, which was becoming a popular resort area and opened a casino in 1916.

Jaluluddin writes a column for the Toronto Star. She is also a high school teacher, an occupation she shares with the protagonist of her first novel. During an interview, her friend, fellow novelist, Ausma Zehanat Khan described their writing circle, which she called the Sisterhood of the Pen, that include Jalaluddin and S.K. Ali. The trio of friends offer one another valuable advice, when they read one another's early drafts. Jalaluddin described loving reading, and always wanting to write, but finding it hard to find novels about people who looked like her, and deciding to write one herself. Jalaluddin started the novel while pregnant with her son Ibrahim, shelved it, then dusted it off, and finished it, after telling seven- year-old Ibrahim about it. In 2017 Jalaluddin was one of several women the Toronto Star interviewed, for their opinions on feminism and the future. The popularity of the highly successful film Crazy Rich Asians, earlier in 2018, is said to have triggered a greater interest in Hollywood acquiring other novels from writers with an Asian background. Film rights were acquired by Amy Pascal's production company, Pascal Pictures, which produced the 2016 Ghostbusters, Spider-Man: Homecoming, The Post and Molly's Game. Pascal Pictures acquired the rights in August 2018, less than four months after the novel's Canadian and UK debut. Ayesha at last was listed for the Toronto Book Awards, and was shortlisted for the 2019 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize, and longlisted for the Stephen Leacock Humour Award. Hearst UK announces a Big Book Award, with each of its major publications naming one title. Cosmopolitan UK named Ayesha at last as its 2019 choice, stating it is a clever homage to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice that you'll love, even if you never got round to reading the original. In December 2019 Bustle asked noteworthy authors of first novels to recommend their favourite novels of 2019. They selected Jalauddin, who recommended A Deadly Divide, a police procedural from her friend Ausma Zehanat Khan. Her second novel, Hana Khan Carries On, has been completed, and is scheduled for publishing in June 2021. Harper Collins says the novel, about a rivalry between two competing halal restaurants, will appeal to fans of the film You've got mail.

Built at the turn of the 17th-century, it is one of the community's oldest surviving buildings, and is noted for its association with a prominent early Episcopal minister. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Description and history The Richard Mansfield House is located in a residential area east of downtown Ansonia, on the east side of Jewett Street just south of its junction with Root Avenue. It is set close to the street, with a low fieldstone retaining wall. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, stone chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The rear roof face extends to the first floor, giving the house a classic New England saltbox profile. The front facade is five bays wide, with sash windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The gable ends at the sides project slightly beyond the faces of the lower wall sections. The interior retains a number of original features, include a fireplace surround. With The house has a build date of at least 1700 and was purchased for Reverend Richard Mansfield, a native of New Haven in 1748. Mansfield had been raised a Congregationalist, but converted to the Church of England, and established a mission in Derby (which Ansonia was then still part of). Mansfield had to flee during the American Revolutionary War due to his Loyalist leanings, but returned and continued to serve in the local Episcopal church until his death in 1820. The house was moved across the street from its original location in 1926, to make way for the church now standing there.

Turku Repair Yard is a part of Estonian BLRT Grupp.  Premises  The company's premises are situated in Naantali, Finland. The dry dock is 265 metres long, 70 metres wide and 7.9 metres deep. The company has also a 101 metres long and 21.6 metres wide floating dock with 4000-tonne capacity and quay which is 184 metres long. The maximum crane capacity is 150 tonnes.  History  The company origins date back to Turku shipbuilding company Crichton-Vulcan and its predecessors. Ships were traditionally hoisted up by using slipways. In 1933, in the middle of the Great Depression, the city of Turku started building a large dry dock next to Korppolaism√§ki with employment subsidies. The quarry work began in 1934 and the new facility was taken into use in August 1937. The 150 metres long, 30 metres wide and eight metres deep dock was large enough for all ships which sailed in the Finnish waters back then. The dock was given to be operated by Crichton-Vulcan and the first docking took place in February 1939.Knorring: Suuri nousu. pp. 107‚Äì114. W√§rtsil√§ took over Crichton-Vulcan at the end of the 1930s and in the 1960s the yard was renamed W√§rtsil√§ Turku Shipyard. In the 1970s W√§rtsil√§ built an entirely new yard in Perno. The W√§rtsil√§ shipyards in Turku were reorganised in 1984. New ships were now built only at Perno yard and the old yard by river Aura focused entirely on ship repairs.Gr√∂nros et al.: Konepaja- ja telakkateollisuuden historiaa. pp. 6‚Äì20. Following bankruptcy of W√§rtsil√§ Marine in 1989, a new company Turku Repair Yard Ltd was established in the same year to continue ship repair operations. In 2003 the company left the premises at river Aura and concentrated its operations in Naantali. The history of the Naantali premises dates back to 1956, when Rainer Sj√∂str√∂m founded shipping and shipbuilding subcontractor Navire Oy. In 1972 the company built in Luonnonmaa island a dry dockKnorring: Crichton-Vulcanista Turun telakkaan. pp. 126‚Äì135. for hull building. Navire was split up in 1981 due to financial difficulties. The company was taken over by Estonian BLRT Grupp in 2007. In 2017 the company announced seeking to develop ship breaking as a new line of business.

It is adjacent to U.S. Route 395 between 27th and Hildebrand Boulevard and is near Southridge High School. The complex has several sports and recreational amenities, as well as a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The facilities on the complex opened in stages, beginning with the baseball fields in 2011, progressing to the carousel in 2014. The grand opening was in 2012. History Planning and construction of the complex took about ten years, with 42 acres being originally allotted for the complex and another ten set aside for later development. In 2009, Kennewick's city council applied to a grant from the State of Washington for $12.5 million to help build infrastructure in the Southridge area to help foster economic growth. The baseball diamonds were complete by July 2011. The first official dedication at the complex was the 9/11 Memorial on the southeast corner of the property, which took place on September 11, 2011 - the 10th anniversary of the attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania. The event included a home run derby and other sports-related activities. The grand opening of the complex occurred the following March, drawing a crowd of about 200 people. Shortly before the grand opening, the city council approved the placement of a historic carousel that was originally built in 1910 and placed in the Silver Beach Amusement Park in St. Joseph, Michigan. After spending over six decades in Michigan, the amusement park it resided in closed. It was dismantled and relocated to Roswell, New Mexico. Gesa Credit Union bought the naming rights to the carousel, and it was opened in 2014 after Kennewick invested $830,000 into its restoration. Facilities Located on the site are numerous indoor and outdoor sports facilities that can be rented. Outside, there are four baseball diamonds and multi-use fields. The sports pavilion is the only one of its kind in the region and features full size courts for basketball and volleyball. The pavilion can also be rented for non-sporting events. Beyond the sports facilities, the complex has a splash pad, and a concession stand. The Gesa Carousel of Dreams is a restored 1910 carousel located on the site. It has 45 horses, all of which were carved by Charles Carmel. Carmel emigrated from Russia in 1883 and worked for many carousel manufacturers. The building also serves as an events center that can host up to 100 individuals. The 9/11 Memorial is a tall piece of the wreckage from the World Trade Center weighing that was obtained from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011. The memorial sits on a square base that has two basalt pillars that symbolize the original Twin Towers.

At that time it was not a given thing for an actor to perform in different types of roles, as 18th-century actors often specialized in certain types of roles, but Maria Henry became known for her versability. She also performed singing parts and was an appreciated singer. She belonged to the elite of the actors of the colonial and early post-revolutionary American stage and was referred to as \\"the first primadonna of the American stage\\".

Nevertheless, she retained her popularity as one of the stars of the American stage until her retirement.

Sensemann has been based in Chicago since 1979.  Life and career  Sensemann was born in Glen Cove, New York in 1949. Her early interest in art was sparked by trips with her mother to New York City art museums and a supportive art teacher who introduced her to Cubism in sixth grade. She studied printmaking at Syracuse University (BFA, 1971), but gravitated to painting after spending junior year at the Tyler School of Art, Rome. She enrolled in the graduate program at Tyler at Temple University (MFA, painting, 1973), studying with painter Richard Callner, whose mythological paintings and glazing techniques influenced her early work. In 1973, Sensemann took a teaching position at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. While there, she met her future husband, sculptor Barry Hehemann. They married in 1979 and moved into a live/work loft in Chicago's industrial Bucktown neighborhood (they divorced in 2004). In 1981, Sensemann joined the faculty at the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), where she would remain until 2010. After she and Hehemann had two children, Lucas (b. 1981) and Marah (b. 1985), Sensemann balanced the demands of motherhood, academia and art, continuing to show internationally and throughout the United States, including solo exhibitions at the Roy Boyd, Artemisia (both Chicago), Fay Gold (Atlanta) and Locus (St. Louis) galleries and the Evanston Art Center, among many. She also served as co-president and board member of Artemisia Gallery (1994‚Äì2001), where she co-created international artist exchange and mentoring programs, curated shows, and exhibited and lectured internationally on women's issues in art.Nordhaus-Bike, Anne M. \\"The state of Chicago's galleries,\\" Gazette Chicago, 1997.

Harvard-University-based NiemanLab described Angwin and Larson as a \\"journalist-programmer team\\" at ProPublica who uncovered stories such as \\"how algorithms are biased\\". In April 2019, she was dismissed from the Markup. Five of the seven editorial staff immediately resigned in support of her, and over 145 journalists and researchers signed a letter of support. In August, she was reinstated in her role as editor-in-chief and The Markup was reformed with the original editorial staff. Wall Street Journal Angwin was a Wall Street Journal staff reporter based at their New York bureau covering business and technology for thirteen years from 2000 to 2013, when she left for ProPublica. In their review of Dragnet Nation, The Economist, wrote that Angwin, beginning in 2010, had overseen Wall Street Journals \\"pioneering series\\" entitled \\"What They Know\\" which exposed how privacy was being eroded with most people completely unaware that it was happening. While at the Wall Street Journal, in 2010, Angwin wrote about how Google's co-founders, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt disagreed on the development of Google Chrome with Schmidt opposing the idea because of potential \\"browser wars\\". A November 23, 2009 article by Angwin and Geoffrey A. Fowler, entitled \\"Volunteers Log Off as Wikipedia Ages\\" on the \\"unprecedented numbers of the millions\\" of Wikipedia editors that were quitting, was featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

The Economist, Kirkus Reviews, and the Los Angeles Times gave Dragnet Nation favorable reviews. In a 2014 interview with Bill Moyers about Dragnet Nation, Angwin described reporters as \\"prime targets for Internet snooping\\" and \\"the canary in the coal mine\\" of internet privacy - the first to feel the \\"impact of total surveillance\\".

Silver market includes, among others, good, values and services for affluent older people; special solutions in trade between operators, allowing adjustments to aging workforce; ideas of universal design and transgenerational design that aim is to adapt goods and services to people of different ages (\\"age-friendly\\"), physical condition and cognitive abilities, which may result in improved social integration.Coulmas, Florian, Looking at the Bright Side of Things, in The Silver Market Phenomenon: Business Opportunities in an Era of Demographic Change, ed. Florian Kohlbacher and Cornelius Herstatt, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg 2008, v‚Äìvi. The silver economy is not a single sector, but rather a collection of products and services from many existing economic sectors, including information technology, telecommunications, financial sector, housing, transport, energy, tourism, culture, infrastructure and local services, and long-term care.Klimczuk, Andrzej, \\"Comparative Analysis of National and Regional Models of the Silver Economy in the European Union\\", International Journal of Ageing and Later Life 2/2016, s. 31-59.

It focuses on the concept of bandits within the mythology, folklore, and literature of Europe, specifically its relation to classical Marxist concepts of class struggle. Summary Eric Hobsbawm sets out to explore and analyze the history of banditry and organized crime and its relationship to class structures of agrarian societies. Hobsbawm specifies a specific form of crime that fit into the category of social bandit, which represented groups of young men, landless peasants, free-men, and military deserters. Social bandits are distinguished from other forms of organized crime in how the majority peasantry perceived the bandits as rebels who opposed the unjust system of feudalism. Among social bandits there are three main historical categories: that of \\"The Noble Robbers\\", \\"The Avengers\\", and the \\"haiduks\\". The Noble Robbers are the romanticized concept of noble criminals who fight injustice and have a large popularity with the lower classes; key figures include Robin Hood, Diego Corrientes Mateos and Juro Janosik. The Avengers are bandits whose acts of cruelty and violence distinguish them as people both feared and respected by common people. Often they had very few redeeming qualities yet commanded respect because of their brutality.

For a period of her career she published educational books under the direction of The Committee of General Literature and Education, appointed by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. How we Dine, or Dinners Ready (1866) is the most notable of her educational contributions.  Early life  Emma Anne Georgiana Webber Davenport was born circa 1819. Her parents were Caroline Frances Fynes-Clinton and the Very Reverend James Webber, Dean of Ripon (1772-1847). They married on 13 September 1813. The Very Rev. James Webber was painted as an example of church abuses in his time and thus was buried without monument when he died in 1847. Emma was one of seven children.  Marriage  Emma Anne Georgiana Davenport married Charles Edgecombe Davenport on 28 January 1847. Charles was the youngest son of Rear-Admiral Sir Salusbury Pryce Humphreys (1778-1845) and Maria Davenport (m. 31 May 1810). Charles was a member of the Royal Regiment and thus the couple and their children moved multiple times through Scotland and England over their life together.

Most of these can be classified as chapter books for children, however the book The Dawn and the Object (1867) was critiqued as an adult novel. Many of her books were written with the intent of teaching young children and encouraging their curiosities. In the preface of her novel Jamie's Questions (1858), she says \\"Enough only is said to excite curiosity, and to tempt an intelligent child to seek further, after having gained a slight knowledge of many things that provoke natural inquiry.\\" Through her novels, Davenport encouraged children to seek what is to be learned from everyday life.

She garnered fame for an incident in which she killed 140 rattlesnakes. Early life Katherine McHale Slaughterback was born on 25 July 1893 (or 1894) to Wallace and Albina McHale in a log cabin near Longmont, Colorado. She would go on to attend nursing school at St. Joseph's School of Nursing and move to Hudson, Colorado. She also had skill as a taxidermist. She frequently wore pants instead of dresses, which was unusual for a woman at the time. Slaughterback married and divorced six timesone of her husbands was Jack Slaughterbackand had one son, Ernie Adamson. It is disputed if Ernie was an adopted child or born to her out of wedlock. Rattlesnake namesake On 28 October 1925, Slaughterback singlehandedly killed 140 rattlesnakes. Slaughterback and her son Ernie were on horseback headed to a lake near her farm. Hunters had been there the day before, and she was hoping to find harvested ducks left behind. However, she instead found over 100 migrating rattlesnakes. She shot the snakes until she ran out of ammunition for her .22 caliber Remington rifle, at which point she grabbed a nearby sign (allegedly, it said \\"No Hunting\\") and bludgeoned the remaining snakes to death. Of her ordeal, Slaughterback later said: She was \\"frantic that [the snakes] would frighten the horse, and cause him to rear up and throw Ernie into the snakes.\\" After she returned to her farm, a neighbor learned of what had happened, which eventually led to a reporter coming to photograph and interview her. She strung the dead snakes together on a rope for the photograph, which became infamous. She would later make herself a dress, shoes, and belt from the snakeskins. The dress, made from the skins of 53 rattlesnakes, was particularly famous. She claimed later that she received an offer from the Smithsonian Institution to buy it for US$2,000. Her story became popular and was written about it the New York Evening Journal. News of her exploits was reported as far away as Germany, Belgium, Scotland, France, England, Mexico, and Canada. Later in life, Slaughterback raised rattlesnakes, milking them for their venom and selling it to scientists in California. Three weeks before her death, Slaughterback donated her famous rattlesnake skin dress to the Greeley Municipal Museum; Ernie donated more of her possessions after her death, including her Remington rifle. Later life and death Slaughterback was a nurse during World War II and served in the Pacific Theater. She lived in El Paso, Texas for a few years.She died on 6 October 1969, and was buried in Mizpah Cemetery in Platteville, Colorado. On her headstone, her name simply reads \\"Rattlesnake Kate,\\" per her request. She was survived by her son , two grandsons, and two great-grandchildren. In modern culture Former member of The Lumineers and Colorado native Neyla Pekarek wrote a folk opera about Slaughterback called Rattlesnake. Pekarek was then commissioned by the Denver Center for the Performing Arts to create a full musical from the subject matter.

Private ownership The park is developed and operated by a private firm on a for profit basis. The land for the park was acquired through expropriation of farmland and relocation of its residents. Compared to the compensation given for farmland for the expansion of the area for the Leshan Giant Buddha, the compensation for the privately run Oriental Buddha Park was higher than the compensation provided by the local government developing the Leshan Giant Buddha.

It is a Grade I listed building. The house was built for Nathaniel Crew, 3rd Baron Crew, Bishop of Durham, but has been modified and extended several times since then. It is constructed of brick with ashlar dressings and has large hipped plain tiled roof with a flat top. It is built to a 2-storey double pile plan of 5 by 3 bays with basement and attic. It is approached from the end of the village main street through a forecourt with 3 pavilions (formerly 4) in the corners and was originally surrounded by a wide moat. History Sir Thomas Crewe, Speaker of the House of Commons, had purchased the estate in 1625, after which it had passed down to Nathaniel Crew, who died in 1721 with no children. He left the estate to his great-nephew James Montagu, MP for Chippenham and Camelford. James made many improvements to the house and grounds. On his death in 1748 the property passed to his cousin, the diplomat Sir Edward Wortley- Montagu, MP of Wortley Hall, Yorkshire. He died in 1761 and his wife, the celebrated writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a year later, leaving Newbold Verdon (but no money) to their errant son, the traveller Edward Wortley Montagu. He sold the house in 1767 to pay his gambling debts and moved to live in the Middle East. The house was afterwards owned by the Cradock-Hartopp family until the 20th century. By the 19th century, however, the building was being used as a rented farmhouse and renamed Hall Farm. In 1965 it belonged in turn to Mr. J.G. Selkirk and his son Ian.

The Stop Our Ship (SOS) movement, a component of the overall civilian and GI movements against the Vietnam War, was directed towards and developed on board U.S. Navy ships, particularly aircraft carriers heading to Southeast Asia. It was concentrated on and around major U.S. Naval stations and ships on the West Coast from mid-1970 to the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, and at its height involved tens of thousands of antiwar civilians, military personnel and veterans. It was sparked by the tactical shift of U.S. combat operations in Southeast Asia from the ground to the air. As the ground war stalemated and Army grunts increasingly refused to fight or resisted the war in various other ways, the U.S. ‚Äúturned increasingly to air bombardment‚Äù. By 1972 there were twice as many Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin as previously and the antiwar movement, which was at its height in the U.S. and worldwide, became a significant factor in the Navy. While no ships were actually prevented from returning to war, the campaigns, combined with the broad antiwar and rebellious sentiment of the times, stirred up substantial difficulties for the Navy, including active duty sailors refusing to sail with their ships, circulating petitions and antiwar propaganda on board, disobeying orders, and committing sabotage, as well as persistent civilian antiwar activity in support of dissident sailors. Several ship combat missions were postponed or altered and one ship was delayed by a combination of a civilian blockade and crewmen jumping overboard. The major targets of the SOS movement were four different aircraft carriers, the USS Constellation, the USS Coral Sea, the USS Kitty Hawk and the USS Enterprise, with lesser but significant activity on and around a number of other ships.  USS Constellation  The first effort began in 1970 in San Diego, the principal homeport of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet., Naval Base San Diego A San Diego-based antiwar group, Nonviolent Action, founded by peace activist Francesco Da Vinci, came up with the idea of the Constellation Project, sometimes called The Harbor Project (the SOS name developed later). It was a nonviolent campaign to oppose the war and, at the same time, to show support for the crew of the USS Constellation. Through leaflets and letters, NVA told the sailors that they were not against them, they were only against their orders. NVA's nonviolent campaign attracted other peace groups such as the Concerned Officers Movement and the Peoples Union. As press coverage of the Constellation Project expanded, it drew the attention of antiwar activists from all over California, including Joan Baez and David Harris. At that point, David Harris suggested expanding the Constellation Project into a Constellation Vote - a citywide referendum asking San Diegans to vote on whether the USS Constellation should be redeployed to Vietnam or stay home for peace. The Constellation Vote set the spark for the larger SOS movement to come., San Diego Nonviolent Action Anti-Aircraft Carrier Initial Statement; accessed December 23, 2017. =Constellation Vote= Poster used for the Constellation Vote Although the city-wide Constellation Vote was non-binding, it served as a dramatic exercise in democracy. It gave not only San Diego citizens a voice in regard to being for or against the carrier's return to Southeast Asia, it also gave sailors a chance to vote. The Constellation Vote was a symbolic nonviolent action, not one that intended to stop the carrier from returning to Vietnam. Joan Baez Wearing Stay Home For Peace T-Shirt, Joan Baez Prior to Singing at a Constellation Vote Rally In preparation of the Constellation Vote, hundreds of activists, including sailors and veterans, canvassed the city. The canvassing was followed by a citywide straw vote from September 17th through September 21st, 1971. Out of 54,721 votes counted, over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a \\"real\\" vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable, boosted by national prime time coverage by CBS and ABC television.

It also permitted creative methods not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as the CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner frequently seen being towed over the city by recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler, and the Constellation Vote stickers found everywhere on board the USS Constellation, including in the captain's personal bathroom.Constellation Vote Logo, Constellation Vote Logo Used on Stickers and FlyersPraxis Underground Newspaper V.1 No.7, October 6, 1971 p.9, \\"Stay Home For Peace Stickers\\" Land GI in Brig Bathroom stickers weren't the only complication the Captain had to deal with. Over 1,300 of the ship's sailors signed a petition requesting actress Jane Fonda's antiwar FTA Show, known to most GIs as the \\"Fuck The Army\\" show, be allowed on board. The captain refused this request but then got himself in hot water by intercepting and destroying 2,500 pieces of U.S. mail sent by antiwar activists to crewmembers. Faced with a possible court of inquiry and health problems, the captain was removed from command before the ship sailed. =Research and pamphlet= Laying the basis for the broader SOS movement to come, a considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of MIT, who was then a visiting Professor of History at UC San Diego. He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons \\"used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world.\\", Attack Carrier: The Constellation Papers, September 1971 =The Connie 9= When the Constellation set sail for Vietnam in on October 1, 1971, nine of its crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church, Christ the King. The \\"Connie 9\\", as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by US Marshals and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the Navy.  USS Coral Sea  As news of the efforts to stop the sailing of the Constellation spread, crewmen aboard the USS Coral Sea, an aircraft carrier stationed at the Alameda Naval Air Station in the San Francisco area, decided to circulate a petition and the SOS movement officially acquired its name. Their ‚ÄúStop Our Ship‚Äù petition stated in all capital letters: ‚ÄúTHE SHIP CAN BE PREVENTED FROM TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN THE CONFLICT IF WE THE MAJORITY VOICE OUR OPINION THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE VIETNAM WAR.‚Äù It then asked fellow sailors to sign if they felt the ship should not go to Vietnam. The petition was started on September 12, 1971, and within three days it had gathered 300 signatures, at which point the ship's executive officer ordered it confiscated., Stop Our Ship Leaflet p.2 (USS Coral Sea), Stop Our Ship Petition (USS Coral Sea) =Antiwar activity on board ship= Active duty sailors, Bob Musa (left) and Larry Harris (right) speak at a protest rally. Undeterred, the antiwar sailors created dozens of new copies and begin recirculating it with instructions about how to avoid confiscation. The military brass, however, declared the petition illegal and arrested three crewmen for passing out antiwar literature. With the ship now at sea for pre-deployment trials, a tit-for tat battle erupted. On September 28, 14 sailors passed out petitions and an antiwar GI underground newspaper in the mess hall in front of the captain. The captain responded by having several men arrested, some of whom claimed they were beaten in the brig. Word of these activities reached the civilian antiwar movement in the San Francisco area, and, when the Coral Sea passed under the Golden Gate Bridge as it returned to port on October 7, a large SOS banner was hung over the side of the bridge. Seventy crewmen responded in kind, forming the letters SOS on the flight deck as the ship passed under the bridge. The Navy then began to discharge those it viewed as leaders of the petition drive. =Protests spread= Four active duty sailors from the USS Coral Sea lead large antiwar march on Nov. 6 1971. By the time the dust had settled, over a 1,000 members of the crew had signed the petition - about 25% of the over 4,000 men assigned to the ship. On November 6, over 300 men from Coral Sea marched with over 10,000 others in an anti-war demonstration in San Francisco. In an unprecedented move the Berkeley City Council declared the city a sanctuary for the men on the Coral Sea who were refusing to go to war. The council encouraged city residents to \\"provide bedding, food, medical and legal help\\" to the sailors, and \\"passed a motion to establish a protected space where soldiers could access counseling and other support.‚Äù Ten local churches also offered sanctuary. In response a U.S. Attorney in San Francisco said ‚Äúhe would not hesitate to prosecute anyone who willfully harbors a military deserter‚Äù. When the ship sailed on November 12, around 1,200 protestors demonstrated outside of Naval Air Station Alameda to encourage sailors not to sail and at least 35 crewmen failed to report for duty. =On the way to Vietnam= When the Coral Sea arrived in Hawaii in late November, it was greeted by a special performance in Honolulu of the FTA antiwar show, featuring Jane Fonda, Donald Sutherland, and Country Joe McDonald., Liberated Barracks Vol.1 No.3 Nov. 1971 More than 4,000 people attended, including approximately 2,500 members of the military and several hundred sailors from the Coral Sea. After the show, approximately 50 crewmen met with the show's cast. When the ship pulled out of port to continue to Southeast Asia, another 53 sailors were missing.In January 1972 with the ship off Vietnam, Secretary of the Navy John Chafee visited the Coral Sea. SOS activists on board held a demonstration and presented the Navy Secretary with a petition which 36 of them had signed., SOS From The Coral Sea - Supporting Materials for the film Sir! No Sir!  USS Kitty Hawk  Stop the Hawk sticker, found all over the ship. Meanwhile, back in San Diego, another aircraft carrier, the USS Kitty Hawk, was preparing for deployment to Southeast Asia. Sailors on board, with help from the Concerned Military (the San Diego Concerned Officers Movement had broadened its membership to include enlisted personnel and changed its name) and civilian antiwar forces, began publishing their own newspaper called Kitty Litter and organizing a personalized version of SOS called ‚ÄúStop the Hawk‚Äù. They circulated an antiwar petition which gathered several hundred signatures, but most copies were confiscated by superiors. On November 15, 1972, around 150 Kitty Hawk crewmen attended a rally to hear Joan Baez sing and listen to four of their crewmates speak out against the war. Two days later, when the ship set sail for Indochina, 7 members of the crew publicly refused to sail and took refuge in local churches. With the ship at sea, copies of Kitty Litter continued to be published by civilian supporters and mailed to antiwar crewmen who circulated them on board and submitted articles. One article published in the August 1972 issue pointed to a serious problem on board: \\"In two consecutive masts, Captain Townsend has put several black men into the brig for fighting with white men, while dismissing \\"with a warninn\\" a white man who spoke in a demeaning manner to a black man and then proceeded to punch him in the stomach! Needless to say, this angered the black men on board, as well as many white men\\". Clearly more trouble was brewing on the Hawk that was soon starkly revealed (see below)., Kitty Litter (USS Kitty Hawk Newsletter) 1972  USS Enterprise  The world first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise, the Navy's pride and joy, was not immune from dissention. In mid-1972 a number of dissident sailors on board began publishing a mock version of the ship's official paper the Enterprise Ledger. Called the SOS Enterprise Ledger, it was virtually identical to the original except that it contained an antiwar and rebellious message. The ship's commanding officer responded by issuing regulations prohibiting the distribution of literature he hadn't approved. The SOS sailors decided they needed to learn more about military law and attended a class called ‚ÄúTurning the Regs Around‚Äù conducted by the Bay Area Military Law Panel. They then wrote and distributed a pamphlet outlining the legal rights of GIs. They then knew they could legally petition Congress, so they created a petition opposing both the war in Vietnam and the military's denial of basic G.I. rights. The petition began circulating on board and was quickly gathering signatures when it was confiscated by the brass. The Navy was quite alarmed by this activity on board their showpiece ship, and naval intelligence agents were called in. They began interrogating known SOS activists about alleged sabotage incidents and threatening revocation of security clearances. Since most of the agents' questions were about SOS, SOS plans and past SOS activity, it seemed to the sailors that they were trying to find out more about SOS through scare tactics ‚Äì as one sailor put it, ‚Äúmaking us think we were going to be charged with sabotage to scare us into talking to clear ourselves.\\", SOS Newsletter September 1972 p.3 When the ship set sail from Alameda Naval Air Station on September 12, 1972, 5 SOS organizers were escorted off the ship under armed guard, while antiwar GIs, vets and civilians protested on shore and members of the \\"Peoples Blockade\\" sailed small boats in the San Francisco Bay symbolically blocking the Enterprise. Other aircraft carriers When the USS Midway left Alameda NAS in April 1972, sixteen enlisted men assigned to Fighter Squadron 151 on board the carrier signed an antiwar letter to President Nixon. On board the USS Ticonderoga in San Diego, sailors organized a movement they called ‚ÄúStop It Now‚Äù (SIN), and 3 of the crew refused to board the ship when it set sail in May 1972. Once at sea, protests continued and there were reports of antiwar meetings of as many as 75 crew members. In Norfolk, Virginia, on the East Coast, civilian antiwar groups organized against the sailing of the USS America. When it began to leave port on June 5, 1972, thirty-one activists in thirteen canoes and kayaks positioned themselves in front of the massive ship. ‚ÄúWhen the Coast Guard moved in to clear the demonstrators, hundreds of sailors on the deck of the America jeered and pelted the cutters with garbage; in a clear show of support for the protesters.‚Äù Also in June, but back up at Alameda, civilians were protesting the pending departure of the USS Oriskany. ‚ÄúWhen the ship left, on June 6, as estimated twenty-five crew members refused to sail, including a group of ten men who turned themselves in to naval authorities on June 13 and issued a bitter public\\" statement. In part they said: \\"the only way to end the genocide being perpetrated now in South East Asia is for us, the actual pawns in the political game, to quit playing.\\", Camp News August 15, 1972 p.4  Civilian and veteran support groups for SOS  Given the strict discipline within the military as well as the not uncommon heavy handed response to internal dissent from military commanders, civilian support was an essential part of these military protests. From the beginning civilians and military veterans (many newly discharged from the very same ships) played a supporting role in the key Navy ports. =Center for Servicemen‚Äôs Rights= In San Diego, the local antiwar groups, including some of those who had waged the initial campaign against the USS Constellation, took their support to a more organized level by banding together in 1972 to form the Center for Servicemen‚Äôs Rights. They rented a large storefront space in the middle of the main GI strip which contained a bookstore, mimeo, meeting rooms and a stage; staffed by a \\"collective of volunteers that included active duty sailors, a few Marines, veterans, and civilian activists.\\" They provided individual and group counselling on GI rights, conscience objection and other means of opposing the war, as well as support for sailors who wanted to publish their own newspapers, leaflets or articles. =Up Against the Bulkhead= The San Francisco underground GI newspaper Up Against the Bulkhead and its staff played an important role in supporting the SOS movement, particularly the dissident sailors of the Coral Sea. Founded in 1970, by late 1971 it could be found everywhere GIs congregated in the San Francisco Bay Area and sailors knew where to go when they wanted counterculture help and friendship. As two Bulkhead staffers reported years later, \\"In 1971 a handful of sailors from the USS Coral Sea\\" showed up at the Bulkhead office \\"ready for action\\". The sailors \\"were a colorful lot, veritable hippies in uniform...more than eager not only to investigate ways to oppose the war, but also ways to sample the offerings of countercultural hedonism.\\" With Bulkhead support the sailors went on to start the first SOS petition and officially launch the Stop Our Ship name., Poster: A Warship Can Be Stopped - Support the Men of the Coral Sea, Up Against the Bulkhead Underground Newspaper =Subic Bay GI Center= In January 1972, attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild, worked with several active duty sailors to create a support center in Olongapo, Philippines, just outside Subic Bay, the largest U.S. Navy installation in the Pacific at that time. Sparked by the appearance of the FTA Show in December, the center was soon publishing an underground newspaper called Seasick. The center supported dissenting GIs and worked to improve the conditions for sailors on shore leave, including by helping sailors gather over 500 signatures on a petition against police brutality by the Shore Patrol. The center was swiftly put out of business in September 1972 when martial law was declared in the Philippines (see below)., Seasick Underground Newspaper =SOS offices= There were SOS offices in Oakland, serving the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, the office opened in January 1972 with SOS standing for Support Our Soldiers, carrying on efforts initiated several years earlier by supporters of the GI Coffeehouse movement. They began putting out a newsletter called SOS News and announced in their first issue that they were ‚Äúa support office for the GI Movement.‚Äù They pledged to take responsibility for ‚Äúraising money, providing literature and films, recruiting staff, maintaining communications and providing publicity for GI coffeehouses and projects.‚Äù, SOS News Los Angeles In Oakland, the Support Our Soldiers office offered similar supprt to the GI movement. Their newsletter stated that they would \\"try to fill the needs for money, staff, educational materials, and communication that individual organizing projects cannot fulfill themselves.\\", SOS News Oakland  Increased air war leads to increased resistance  In March 1972 the last U.S. ground combat division was withdrawn from Vietnam just as the North Vietnamese Army launched the Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá or Easter Offensive. The U.S. responded by massively increasing its air war. ‚ÄúOne main component was to be a flotilla of Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers (twice as many as in 1971) massed in the Gulf of Tonkin‚Äù. As the air and naval activity in the Pacific intensified, drastic changes occurred within the Navy. ‚ÄúDuring the remainder of the year, as many as four carriers‚Ä¶were on combat station in the Tonkin Gulf at one time‚Ä¶. Normal fleet routine was completely disrupted‚Ä¶. For the crew members involved, the escalation created severe hardships‚Äù. And as the concerns of sailors for their safety at sea \\"became entangled with the enlarged Indochina war effort\\" it \\"led to protests against conditions that under other circumstances might have been bearable but, for the purpose of bombing Vietnam, were seen as intolerable‚Äù. Many of the sailors were already ambivalent or even antagonistic to the war, and now they were confronted with extremely intense and difficult, even unsafe, working conditions. The U.S.‚Äôs new strategy ‚Äúwas torpedoed by a massive antiwar movement among the sailors, who combined escalating protests and rebellions with a wide-spread campaign of sabotage.‚Äù =Great Lakes Naval Station= The Navy's sudden need for additional personnel greatly intensified the pressure for new recruits and training. The Great Lakes Naval Station, located north of Chicago, IL, is the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. On May 20, 1972, the Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM) and the Chicago Area Military Project organized an Armed Forces Day demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000. Soon a petition was being circulated on the base opposing the increased speed-up in training that gathered more than 600 signatures. =USS Nitro= Canoes and small boats attempting to blockade the USS Nitro as it departed for Vietnam. Crew members aboard the USS Nitro, a munitions ship loaded with armament at the Naval Weapons Station in Earle, New Jersey, staged one of the most dramatic protests. Worried about the war and the unsafe conditions on board they contacted civilian antiwar organizations who helped them draw up a list of specific shipboard hazards, which they circulated, gathering signatures from 48 members of the crew. The petition resulted in little change, but on April 24, 1972, as the ship was pulling out of port, it was greeted by an antiwar blockade of seventeen canoes and small boats. As the Coast Guard attempted to disperse the demonstrators, they were first confronted by dissent from within their ranks,, SOS News Los Angeles May 1972 p. 4 and then, one of the Nitro's crew on the ‚Äúship‚Äôs deck suddenly stood up on the rail, raised the clenched-fist salute, and literally jumped overboard!‚Äù He was quickly followed by six more crew members, including one non-swimmer who had donned a life jacket. William Monks, one of the seven who jumped explained his actions later:  Racial conflicts and resistance  Col. Robert D. Heinl, Jr. stated in a 1971 study in the Armed Forces Journal called ‚ÄúThe Collapse of the Armed Forces‚Äù, that ‚ÄúInternally speaking, racial conflicts and drugs‚Ä¶are tearing the services apart today.‚Äù Historians of the war have documented that non-white GIs were often given the dirtiest jobs and frequently sent to the front lines in combat situations. And a task force reporting to the Secretary of Defense at the time, Melvin R. Laird, found that racial discrimination in the military was not confined to the military but was ‚Äúalso a problem of a racist society‚Äù. Historian Gerald Gill contended that by 1970 most black soldiers thought the war was a mistake, ‚Äúhypocritical in intent and racist and imperialist by design.‚Äù One black soldier was quoted as saying that black soldiers were sent on risky assignments by white officers so that ‚Äòthere would be one less nigger to worry about back home.‚Äô‚Äù In 1972 the problems that Heinl and others were describing in the Army were about to explode in the Navy. As an article in The New York Times put it, ‚ÄúThe Navy, with its tradition of Filipino waiters and Southern WASP leadership, never really was an alternative for America's young city blacks during the early years of the Vietnam war.‚Äù But, Navy commanders under pressure to increase recruitment to meet the needs of the expanding air war, ‚Äúdecided to change the Navy's image and its appeal to blacks.‚Äù By late 1972 approximately 12 percent ‚Äúof new Navy recruits were black‚Äù, and they ‚Äúwere typically assigned to the ship's most miserable jobs‚Äù, and often \\"thrust into the dreariest, most menial, and most unpopular jobs on board\\" Several unprecedented developments on board U.S. Navy ships dramatically exposed the intersection of antiwar sentiment, civil rights issues, discontent over working and safety conditions and racism. One of the first of these incidents highlighted many of the common threads between them. =Troublemakers in the Philippines= When martial law was declared in the Philippines in September 1972, the U.S. Navy ‚Äúused the occasion to crack down on so-called troublemakers and‚Ä¶loaded more than two hundred enlisted men from eleven different ships onto planes for immediate transfer back to San Diego.‚Äù, Up From the Bottom\\" Underground Newspaper, Vol. 2 No. 6 p.8, Dec 15, 1972 Once in San Diego many of the men wanted to let the public know what had happened and on October 24 ‚Äúa racially mixed group of thirty-one enlisted men held a press conference to denounce the deplorable conditions, harassment, and racial prejudice they encountered while at sea.‚Äù Their statement, partially excerpted here, captured many of the issues swirling within the Navy at that time: =The Kitty Hawk Riot= In October 1972 the Kitty Hawk pulled into Subic Bay after 8 months at sea, expecting a rest before heading home. Instead, the crew was notified they were returning to combat operations in Indochina. Tensions, already high from accelerated combat operations, flared even more. Blacks made up 7 percent of the enlisted crew on board the Hawk, and the majority of them ‚Äúwere assigned to the toughest and dirtiest Navy jobs, in the deck force and on flight decks, while whites populated the more coveted and higher tech jobs in the crew.‚Äù The black crew members felt they had been ‚Äútreated like dogs.‚Äù With a strong sense of black pride and influenced by the civil rights and Black Power movements in the U.S., they were very unhappy with their conditions. During the nights prior to deployment, several racial incidents occurred in Subic Bay enlisted men's club. On October 8, a black sailor went on stage and shouted \\"Black power! This war is the white man's war!\\" and then continued to preach to the drunken crowd. A glass was thrown that hit him in the head, and a fight between blacks and whites broke out. On October 11, the night before the ship was to depart, a larger black-white fight erupted in the EM club which was broken up by a marine riot squad with clubs. Five black and four white sailors were arrested but returned to the ship before it departed. Back at sea, unhappy about being redeployed and overworked, many of the crew were now also deeply angry over racial tensions. Once underway on October 12, an investigating officer began an inquiry into the fight by summoning several black sailors. ‚ÄúThis [singling out of blacks only] was hard to understand in terms of the tensions‚Äù the NY Times quoted an officer saying ‚Äúwho had access to all of the reports of the incident.‚Äù One of those summoned brought ‚Äúnine companions with him and grew belligerent‚Äù. The nine then stormed out to join other black sailors on the mess deck with the crowd soon growing to over one hundred. The chief master-at-arms became alarmed and summoned the marines, a move which was described later by ‚Äúofficialdom‚Äù as the first of ‚Äúa series of mistakes‚Äù and an explosive situation quickly developed. The ship's executive officer ordered the blacks and the Marines to separate ends of the ship, but the Captain issued conflicting orders. In the ensuing confusion, the blacks and the Marines ran into each other on the hangar deck and a fight broke out. ‚ÄúThe fighting spread rapidly, with bands of blacks and whites marauding throughout the ship‚Äôs decks and attaching each other with fists, chains, wrenches, and pipes.‚Äù More conflicting orders were issued resulting in more confusion and fights raged on for much of the night. The fights left 40 white and 6 black sailors injured, including three who had to be evacuated to onshore medical facilities. By morning, a tense calm was achieved and normal flight operations were resumed. However, once arrests were made for the fighting, all of the 25 arrested were black. ‚ÄúThe arrest pattern caused as grave concern in some areas of the Pentagon as the outbreak itself. ‚ÄòAnytime you have a so-called race riot and you lock up 28 blacks,‚Äô one black Navy official noted caustically during a recent interview, ‚Äòthat has to raise some questions.‚Äô‚Äù =Mutiny on the Constellation= As word spread in the fleet about the incidents on board the Kitty Hawk, many of the black sailors on the Constellation were ‚Äúswearing an affinity with their beleaguered brothers on the Kitty Hawk.‚Äù By late October 1972, with the ship undergoing training exercises of the coast of Southern California, black crewmembers formed an organization called the ‚ÄúBlack Fraction,‚Äù ‚Äúwith the aim of protecting minority interests in promotion policies and in the administration of military justice.‚Äù They elected a ‚Äúchairman and three spokesmen to deal with the officers and petty officers of the ship.‚Äù As commanders became aware of the Black Faction, they agreed to a meeting between them and the executive officer with the objective of easing tensions. Prior to the meeting, however, the command ‚Äúsingled out fifteen members of Black Faction as agitators and ordered that six of them be given immediate less-than-honorable discharges.‚Äù At the same time, notice was given ship wide that 250 men would be administratively discharged. Feeling they were being singled out for retaliation for their activism and fearing that most of the additional discharges would be directed at them, over one hundred sailors, including several whites, staged a sit in and refused to work on the morning of November 3. During the day, members of the ship's Human Relations Council attempted to meet with the mutineers in a private dining room with little success as they demanded to see the captain. Around midnight, with the sit-in continuing the captain announced to the ship that any complaints had to go through the chain of command. ‚Äú‚ÄôO.K., that‚Äôs it,‚Äô shouted a black sailor in the dining room. ‚ÄòThey want another Kitty Hawk.‚Äô There were shouts of ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get the captain,‚Äô and ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs take the ship.‚Äù The Captain then called general quarters and ordered senior officers and petty officers to pick out white sailors and move to the mess deck to surround the mutineers where they had now moved. A tense standoff ensued that slowly dissipated overnight. In the morning the captain ‚Äúwashe[d] his hands of the mutineers. He [did] not want to admit mutiny, so he cannot charge the blacks with that. Yet he want[ed] them off his ship.‚Äù The captain, in consultation with others all the way up to the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, decided to cut sea operations short and set the dissidents ashore. Once docked, 144 crew members left the ship, including 8 whites. The Constellation returned to sea but returned a few days later to pick up the mutinous sailors. Most of the men, however, refused to board the ship and on November 9 ‚Äústaged a defiant dockside strike - perhaps the largest act of mass defiance in naval history.‚Äù Despite these unprecedented actions, none of the sailors were arrested, most were simply reassigned to other duty stations, while a few received what were described as ‚Äútrifling punishments‚Äù. Sabotage as resistance As early as 1970 ships had been forced out of action by sabotage by crew members. For example, in June 1970 the destroyer Richard B. Anderson ‚Äúwas kept from sailing to Vietnam for eight weeks when crew members deliberately wrecked an engine.‚Äù But, in tandem with the SOS Movement, naval sabotage became an even more serious issue in 1972 as the air war dramatically expanded. ‚ÄúIn July fires were started on the Forrestal and Ranger, the eighteenth instance of sabotage aboard the latter vessel, a prime target back home for peace activists‚Äô ‚ÄòStop Our Ships‚Äô agitation.‚Äù The fire on the Forrestal resulted in over $7 million in damage and was the largest single act of sabotage in naval history. In March 1972 when the aircraft carrier USS Midway received orders for Vietnam, ‚Äúdissident crewmen deliberately spilled three thousand gallons of oil into the bay. The captain of the Constellation ‚Äútold a press conference in November of 1972 that ‚Äòsaboteurs were at work‚Äô during the period of unrest aboard his ship.‚Äù The Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Fleet stated in October 1972 that the increase in sabotage was a ‚Äúgrave liability‚Äù to the ability of the Navy to operate. ‚ÄúAll told, by the close of that year the United States Navy would log seventy-four instances of sabotage, more than half on aircraft carriers, none of them attributable to ‚Äòenemy‚Äô action.‚Äù An investigation by the House Armed Services Committee revealed how much the sabotage had undermined naval combat operations and contributed to other forms of unrest during the 1972 bombing campaign. They stated that the October 1972 redeployment of the Kitty Hawk to combat (discussed above) which resulted in riots and near mutiny was apparently ‚Äúdue to the incidents of sabotage aboard her sister ships U.S.S. Ranger and U.S.S. Forrestal.‚Äù  Conclusion  According to Howard Zinn, while the SOS movement had no cohesive central organization or leadership, it was united by the overarching, if ultimately unattained, goal of stopping warships from entering combat in Indochina. Despite this failure on the stated objective, Zinn said, it was a significant part of the latter stages of the overall anti-Vietnam War movement which did, in fact, help to end the war.

Early life Gouverneur was born in 1671 \\"upon the Single, near the Konings Pleyn\\" in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He later moved to New York City in what was then the Province of New York, a part of British America. He was the son of Nicolas Gouverneur (d. 1682) and Maghteld (n√©e de Riemer) Gouverneur (1644‚Äì1721). He was the brother of Elisabeth Gouverneur, Isaac Gouverneur, and Elisabeth Gouverneur. After the death of his father in 1682, his mother remarried to Jasper Nissepadt (Nesbitt), and had another child, Jannetje Nissepadt. Career Gouverneur, a successful merchant, was involved in the organization of Harlem in upper Manhattan, and received land known as the Abraham Gouverneur Patent that he purchased in February 1713. Along with fellow merchant Nicholas Stuyvesant (son of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Amsterdam), he was an associate of German- born businessman Jacob Leisler, the 8th Colonial Governor of New York known for his rabid anti-Catholic Calvinist views and the leader of a populist political faction known as \\"Leislerians\\". Reportedly, four days before Gov. Henry Sloughter arrived in New York, Gouverneur shot the parish clerk and was charged with his murder. After Sloughter arrived, he put down Leisler's Rebellion and Leisler was hanged in May 1691. A year after Leisler's execution, Gourverneur and Jacob Leisler Jr. traveled to London and lobbied government officials, members of Parliament, and cabinet officers to clear Leisler's name, and were eventually helped by the powerful Whigs. He was a member of the New York General Assembly, representing Orange County (which is now Orange and Rockland counties), from 1699 to 1702, and later representing New York County (the current New York County, Manhattan), from 1701 to 1702. From May 15, 1699 to May 3, 1702, he was also the Speaker of the Assembly. Later, he served as Recorder of New York City, essentially the deputy mayor of New York City, from 1701 to 1703 under mayors Isaac De Riemer, Thomas Noell, and Phillip French. Personal life Gouverneur was married to Mary Leisler (1669‚Äì1747), the daughter of his associate Jacob Leisler. Mary was the widow of Jacob Milborne, the English born clerk who was an ally and secretary of Mary's father, both of whom were executed for their part in Leisler's Rebellion. Together, they were the parents of four children who reached maturity, including: * Nicholas Gouverneur (1700‚Äì1739), who was the father of Abraham, Esther, Barent and Nicholas Gouverneur. * Jacoba Gouverneur (b. 1701) * Elizabeth Gouverneur (1704‚Äì1751) * Jacob Gouverneur (b. 1710), who died young. * Maria Gouverneur (b. 1712), who married Henry Myer Jr. and Captain Jasper Farmer.

It is decorated using the red-figure technique and depicts a continuous scene from Greek old comedy. This vessel is currently housed in the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Due to compositional and stylistic similarities, the Red Figure Pelike with an Actor Dressed as a Bird is often compared to a calyx-krater that was previously housed in the J. Paul Getty Museum until it was returned to the Italian Ministry of Culture in 2007.  Description  = Vessel type = While the historical term for two- handled vases with a large, bulbous bodies, such as this one, remains unknown, the term pelike (pl. pelikai) is generally used to refer to such vessels today. These vessels were used to store various liquids, such as wine and oil. It is highly likely that this specific pelike was once used as a wine container, as theatrical scenes primarily appear on vessels that relate specifically to wine consumption, such as kraters and oenochoai. Both the fact that Dionysus was the Greek god of both wine and theater, and the understanding that inebriation allowed individuals to lose their inhibitions and adopt new guises, similar to how actors assume various roles, help explain this common artistic practice. = Figural composition = On one side of the vase, an actor is depicted in a twisted and active pose with his left leg lifted in the air. He appears to be taking a large step forward. He wears tights that cover the bulk of his body and are decorated with black dots. These spots recall depictions of animal pelts. The actor also wears high, soft boots called kothornoi, each of which has a phallus attached to its heal. On top of his bodysuit, the actor wears shorts. These also have an attached phallus as well as an attached bird tail. The actor's bird costume is completed by a set of wings and a bird mask. Based on the design of the actor's mask, which includes a comb and wattle, and the phalli that are attached to the actor's boots like spurs, it can be assumed that this actor is meant to represent a rooster. The theatrical space on this vessel is further denoted through the use of two broken meander patterns. The lower of these two patterns compositionally forms the stage on which the actor stands. These meander patterns are continued on the reverse side of the vessel, suggesting that both sides of the pelike represent the same theatrical stage. On the reverse side of the pelike, an older, bearded man is depicted playing an instrument referred to as a double aulos. The musician wears a fillet in his hair and sports a long chiton that is decorated with a spotted pattern, akin to the actor's tights. Taken together, the vase's figural composition indicates a performance by a comedic chorus.  Interpretation  The Red Figure Pelike with an Actor Dressed as a Bird is sometimes grouped with about twenty Greek pottery pieces that are referred to as the komos vases. These vessels all date to between 560 and 420 BC and primarily depict comedic choruses that are composed of either actors dressed as animals or actors riding animals. Gwendolyn Compton-Engle, a scholar of Greek drama, notes that in the case of these vessels, the term komos is used to refer to \\"highly organized spectacle,\\" instead of \\"spontaneous, drunken postsympotic shenanigans.\\" Furthermore, the inclusion of a musician playing an aulos is a common indication that a scene is theatrical in nature. = Aristophanes‚Äô The Birds = Due to the fact that the actor on this pelike is dressed as a bird, it has been suggested that the scene is connected to The Birds, a play by the Athenian dramatist Aristophanes. The vessel, however, predates the production of the play, which was produced in 414 BC, by about ten years. This suggests that while the scene portrayed on the vessel is not directly taken from The Birds, it does provide evidence for a tradition of actors dressing up as birds, from which Aristophanes may have drawn inspiration. = Roosters = In Greek mythology and culture, roosters are highly symbolic birds. This symbolism can provide clues as to the meaning behind the costume of the performer within the context of an old comedy play. In particular, roosters were often associated with the contrasting themes of love and violence. In regard to love, it is known, for example, that mature males would often give beautiful youths roosters as tokens of affection. This is evidenced by the myth of Ganymede, in which Zeus presents the young boy with a rooster before spiriting him off to serve as a cupbearer on Olympus. As comedic plays often satirically critiqued various aspects of Greek life, the topic of pederasty may have been served as a valid theme for a play. On the other hand, the rooster costume may symbolize aggression or violence. In particular, the god of war Ares is said to have changed a man into a rooster for failing to alert him to the rising of the sun. Cock fighting was also a common practice in Greece at the time of this vessel's creation. Furthermore, scholar Eric Caspo has noted that a rooster's comb and wattle resembles Corinthian helmet types. = Satyr plays = This scene on this pelike has also been compared to scenes of satyr plays, especially in relation to the bird actor's costume. Specifically, both the bird actor and actors in depictions of satyr plays are shown wearing the same type of shorts, referred to as perizomata, that have a circular symbol on the hip. Satyr actors also have horse tails attached to their shorts, similar to how the actor on the pelike has an attached bird tail. Furthermore, the depiction of the bird actor, like all depictions of satyr actors, is ithyphallic. It is rare to find depictions of actors playing other humans with erect phalli.

After fighting with his regiment in final days of the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, Mitchell was commissioned as a second lieutenant on January 15, 1863. Now part of the 3rd Corps of the Army of the Potomac, he and his men were next engaged in the Chancellorsville Campaign from April 30 to May 6.

After recuperating from his wounds, Mitchell again returned to his regiment, which continued operations against Confederate troops in Virginia from the late summer through early winter. Briefly under heavy fire near Locust Grove in November 1863, they then participated in the Mine Run Campaign from November 27 to December 2. Moved to winter quarters at Brandy Station later that month, the majority of 105th Pennsylvanians were then awarded veterans‚Äô furloughs after re-enlisting. Departing winter quarters on May 4 1864, Mitchell and his regiment were assigned to the Overland Campaign of Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant, which immediately brought them under fire in the Battle of the Wilderness (May 5‚Äì7). On May 7, Mitchell was commissioned, but not mustered as a captain, and placed in charge of Company A.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5, Vol. III, pp. 786-787.

Career Leigh Harris showed talent at a very young age. Shortly after her first birthday, Leigh was humming lullabies back to her parents; six months later, she'd added the lyrics... \\"and I haven't ever really shut my face since\\" she told poet John Sinclair in a 1999 interview. She performed in public for the first time at age 11 in February 1966 singing and playing her guitar at Tulane University Student Center in their monthly Folk Festival. The hootenanny was broadcast throughout campus and into the dorms of Tulane by WTUL radio. Leigh first performed as \\"Little Queenie\\" on April Fool's Day 1975 at Jed's Bar on Oak Street in uptown New Orleans. By mid-1977, Leigh had a regular Monday night set at Tipitina's with keyboardist John Magnie (also known then as Johnny Zimple) who later played with The Subdudes. With the addition of other talented musicians, this collaboration soon evolved into Li'l Queenie and the Percolators, later called Little Queenie and the Percolators.James Lien \\"A Brief History of New Orleans Rock\\" , March 1, 1998 The band played throughout Louisiana, including regular gigs at New Orleans clubs Tipitina's, Jimmy‚Äôs, The Dream Palace and Snug Harbor and yearly performances at The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The first incarnation of Li'l Queenie and the Percolators in 1977 consisted of Leigh Harris (vocals), John Magnie (keyboards and vocals), John Meunier (bass and vocals), Butch Gomez (sax) and Alan Pecora (drums). Saxophonist Sed Sedlack replaced Gomez and soon afterwards jazz guitarist extraordinaire Emily Remler joined the group for a few months. The next lineup (around 1980) introduced drummer Kenneth Blevins and Fred Kemp on saxophone. In March 1980, Li'l Queenie and the Percolators performed for several nights at Kenny's Castaways nightclub in New York City which led to their first national press. Leigh Harris had made her presence known. Sitting in for Kemp on these gigs was Fred Lipsius, the original saxophonist from Blood, Sweat & Tears. By 1982, band members were Leigh Harris (vocals), John Magnie (keyboards and vocals), Tommy Malone (guitar), Ricky Cortes (bass) and Kenneth Blevins (drums).

Life Catherine Drew was born in Broughshane, County Antrim on 27 May 1832. Her parents were the Rev. Thomas Drew and Isabella Drew (n√©e Dalton). She was the third of the couple's eight daughters and four sons, although most of her siblings died young. Drew spent her childhood in Belfast, where her father was the rector of Christ Church in Durham Street from 1833 to 1859. Drew moved to Dublin at 60 Upper Sackville Street to live with her brother the architect, Thomas Drew, in 1866. From here she appears to have begun her journalist career, writing articles for the Irish Builder, going on to eventually become its assistant editor. She went on to write for the Belfast Newsletter, and following advice from its proprietor James Alexander Henderson, Drew moved to London in 1871 becoming the paper's London correspondent. She wrote two columns, Metropolitan gossip and Ladies' letter, and were among some of the earliest regular columns written specifically for women, providing society news for her readers in Belfast. Articles by her also appeared in The Literary World, The British Architect and London Society. Drew was one of the founding members of the Ladies' Press Association, and campaigned for greater rights for women journalists. She became a prominent figure in the Institute of Journalists, representing the Institute at several international congresses. She was serving as the vice-president of the Institute at the time of her death. She also worked on its Orphan Fund for many years, an initiative she had originally suggested in 1891. In 1894 she was one of the signatories of the Frances Power Cobbe memorial campaigning for greater recognition and rights for women journalists, alongside Millicent Fawcett and Jessie Boucherett. Drew wrote a number of novels, including Harry Chalgraves's legacy (1876) and The lutanistes of St Jacobi's (1881). In March 1885 she gave a lecture titled Dress, economic and technic at the Exhibition of Women's Industries in Bristol, which later appeared as a pamphlet. She died at her home in Holland Street, Kensington on 26 August 1910 and is buried at Kensington Hanwell Cemetery, Broadway.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler's National Socialism. In 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \\"Der St√ºrmer\\" in Timi»ôoara, an imitation of the German Nazi publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children. Life and early work Baron, Karl Gustaf von M√∂ller (1775) who was allegedly an early developer of the Camera The von M√∂ller family's origins are believed to be from the L√ºneburg Heath. Karl von M√∂ller's grandfather volunteered in the Wars of Liberation and was disarmed in Sibiu (Transylvania). von M√∂ller's grandfather is believed by some to be an early developer of the camera but who is generally not given credit for this achievement because he didn't submit a patent application on a timely basis. His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M√∂ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he served as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first at the Serbian and then at the Galician front. Starting in 1916, he served as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel in the Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the Order of Leopold.  Politician  After the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi»ôoara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics. Karl von M√∂ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919, M√∂ller was elected the second mayor of Timi»ôoara. From 1919 to 1926, he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in Bucharest, representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M√∂ller joined the \\"Volksgemeinschaft\\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920. From 1920, he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W√ºrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923, he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of Adolf Hitler. After his return, he became chief editor of the \\"Banat German newspaper\\". He was one of the members of the \\"German People's Council\\". Karl von M√∂ller is considered as one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931, he founded the first Banat local group of the \\"National Socialist Self- Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M√∂ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper ‚ÄúDer St√ºrmer‚Äù in Timi»ôoara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \\"cultural office manager\\" in Sibiu the \\"job for ideological education and cultural policy\\". After his application for admission to the Wehrmacht had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to Karl Schworm on September 7, 1939: \\"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire‚Äù. In 1941, he was appointed the‚Äú cultural council ‚Äùof the German ethnic group in Romania.  Author  According to his biography on the \\"Kulturportal West-Ost\\", in addition to his political \\"von M√∂ller\\" developed a lively writing activity, which was based on the great novels of Adam M√ºller- Guttenbrunn (1852-1923) and the intellectual and political development of Southeastern Germany, but especially the Banat Swabia, from the settlement until their ethnic awakening at the turn of the 20th century. As editor-in- chief of the 'Banater Deutsche Zeitung', he served the 'Banater Schw√§bische Volksgemeinschaft'.‚Äù von M√∂ller's novels try to give a concrete picture of the respective events from the perspective of their time. He is one of the most popular authors of historical novels of his time, but with a nationalist and anti-Semitic touch. von M√∂ller began in the early 1920s with the publication ultranationalist writings. As \\"advocate of folk anti-Semitism\\" he wrote in his Gazette \\"The Striker\\". In his two-volume work \\"How the Swabian communities came into being\\" (Timi»ôoara 1923‚Äì24), M√∂ller 1924 \\"openly expressed his chauvinistic ideas and ideas by incorporating the 'Germanic racial element' (Vol. 2, p. 22) of the German superman into The foreground of his historical statements moved. In the novel ‚ÄúDie Werschetzer Tat‚Äù (1936) he glorified the defence of Werschetz on the westernmost slope of the Banat Mountains at the time of the last great invasion of the Banat in 1788 by the Turks. Based on historical events, the author illustrates the rural life of German settlers of the first generation in the midst of a colourful mix of people and people. He takes on Nazi ideologies back such. B. The glorification of struggle, peasantry and leader personality, the superiority of the \\" Aryan race\\", inferiority, moral and physical degradation of the \\"foreign people\\": The Germans \\"must be protected from the teeth of the strange army wolf, who runs up and down the Danube with hanging blood tongues.\\" In the novel \\"Borders Wander: A Banat Roman\\" (1937) von M√∂ller describes his life and customs of the Banat Swabians from the turn of the century about the First World War and the resulting tripartite division of the Banat in 1920 using the example of the predominantly German-inhabited place Jimbolia. The place fell to Yugoslavia after 1918 and to Romania in 1924 in exchange for Ja≈°a Tomiƒá. As in \\"The Werschetzer act\\" must also in this novel the \\"Aryan\\" hero \\"against their racial opponent\\" claim. In the novel \\"Die Salpeterer: A Freedom Struggle by German Peasants\\" (1938) M√∂ller describes the struggle for freedom of the Hotzenwald Salpeterer in the Black Forest against the Prince-Bishop of St. Blasien and their eventual banishment to the Banat. He describes their homesickness and defiance against the injustice suffered from their point of view and only allows them to become \\"real Banat farmers\\" after generations. von M√∂ller was very active as a writer in his last years. Above all, he published in the Eher-Verlag of the NSDAP. On October 11, 1941, the author's 65th birthday, Reich Minister Joseph Goebbels expressed his thanks to the nation. Joseph Goebbels Military career After graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in Vienna, he was appointed as a senior state officer, and served in several garrisons. In 1913, he was transferred to Timi»ôoara where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from Lieutenant Colonel to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M√∂ller was subsequently promoted to Colonel. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia) after which it was put in reserve by the K√°rolyi government.= 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers√∂nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller Political career in Romania Post World War I, M√∂ller decided to stay back in Timi»ôoara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at Schw√§bische Volkspresse (established 1921; from 1925 the Banat Deutsche Zeitung) for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M√∂ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement. In autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi»ôoara, after which he was elected four times to the Romanian Parliament, in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the 1923 Constitution of Romania on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \\"Banat Swabian People\\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in Alba Iulia./ evolution-German-from-banat-in-context- administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context, demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period In May 1920 the \\"moderate\\" Swabians, led by formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M√∂ller, and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party. In 1927, M√∂ller withdrew from public life and settled in Jimbolia, where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich Involvement in Nazism At the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German- language Jimbolia newspaper, \\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\\", and president of the local ethnic community. M√∂ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931. After 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain Fritz Fabritius. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M√∂ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \\"Gauleiter\\" for the Banat.= Aspects After Karl von M√∂ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \\"Der St√ºrmer\\" in Timi»ôoara.

Plot The game centers around teenagers Arina and Frendt, a girl and boy who live next door to each other and have become close friends since Arina's family moved into the area. One rainy night, the two sneak out and hide in their treehouse, built on a small garden square next to both houses. In the midst of a rainstorm, they see a light sphere form in front of them, which suddenly causes the treehouse to fall into a vast dream ocean with small islands made up of their shared experiences. They sail between the islands in the treehouse to light each portal at the top, and finally to a central island and a large portal, together; as they progress, the weather of this dreamspace becomes overcast and then rainy. Once lit, the islands all collapse into the ocean, leaving them in their treehouse. When the next morning comes Arina and Frendt are hugging each other, as Frendt's family is now moving out. The two say their final goodbyes as Frendt's family drives off. The game consists of about twenty abstract levels, grouped into sets of two or three levels each, each influenced by memories of Arina and Frendt's friendship. Arina gains control of a magic lantern that is able to carry a sphere of light, which is needed to activate a portal to the next level, while Frendt has the ability to sound wind chimes that open or close flowers that provide the light for the lantern, as well as interfacing with a device that manipulates the flow of time for some objects. Obstacles in the environment include small cubes that jump about the level, but which can also carry Arina's lantern past obstacles, flowers that emit a black light that steals spheres of light that come close, and purple fog that is solid when the light is not present but becomes intangible when the light is close. While the path to the portal at the top of each level is straight forward, the game is about manipulating the flow of time. The player does not directly move the characters but instead has their process move forward or backward in time, which will have the pair move forward or backward along the path. However, Arina and Frendt's interactions with the environment remain mutable with time. For example, the player may need to have Arina work forward in time to grab a sphere of light for the lantern, move time backward for her to place it on a jumping cube, and then continue to move forward pass a fog bridge to recollect the cube later. The player cannot move time forward or past a point where either Arina or Frendt cannot progress. Separately, Frendt's ability to interact with devices that control the flow of time for objects in the level may be needed to create paths previously blocked, bring falling light flowers into close proximity to Arina's paths, or similar motions. Other solutions may require lateral thinking that recognizing how the various time stream manipulations can work. Once the player has completed a set of levels, they are presented with a short scene of Arina and Frendt involved in these activities, where a hidden jumping cube can be found using similar time manipulation controls. This completes a constellation, which once the final level is completed, merge into a final memory. Development The Gardens Between was developed by the Australian studio The Voxel Agents. Lead designer and animator Josh Alan Bradbury stated that the game was meant to be an allegory for how one looks back at childhood friends when they become older. Bradbury described how Arina and Frendt are not necessarily the most compatible friends - Arina is shown more adventurous and outgoing, while Frendt is shy and seeks intellectual pursuits - and as an adult may make little sense how they developed a friendship, but through the lens of their shared childhood memories, one is able to see how their friendship developed. The time manipulation mechanics was representative of trying to relive these childhood memories, running through them back and forth in order to recall them correctly. In another interview, executive producer and level designer Simon Joslin revealed that the time manipulation mechanics started with the idea of turning the timeline interface of the movie Minority Report into a game. \\"The experience of using a timeline to review and inspect scenarios felt fascinating, and embryonic of intricate, quizzical experiences.\\" The game's soundtrack was composed by Tim Shiel. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 consoles on 20 September 2018, on Xbox One on 29 November 2018., and for iOS devices on May 17, 2019. Reception The Gardens Between received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews for PS4, and \\"generally favorable\\" reviews for PC and Switch, according to the review aggregator Metacritic. The Verge Michael Moore considered how The Gardens Between presented a type of theoretical physics related to different points of view when discussing the potential of time travel, as what Arina and Frendt would witness would be drastically different from what the player witnesses or other potential perspectives in the game. The Gardens Between won the award for \\"Game of the Year\\" at the 2018 Australian Game Development Awards, and was nominated for \\"Australian Developed Game of the Year\\" at the Australian Games Awards. It was also nominated for \\"Gamer's Voice: Video Game\\" at the SXSW Gaming Awards, and won the award for \\"Puzzle Game\\" at the 2019 Webby Awards, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Best Art Direction\\". It was also nominated for \\"Best Audio/Visual Accomplishment\\" at the Pocket Gamer Mobile Games Awards, and won Apple Design Award for 2019.

It was first established in 1808 and was moved to its present location in 1854.  History  Original cemetery location, next to Maguire Hall The Jesuit cemetery was originally established in 1808 at the southern end of Healy Hall. The first person buried there was Thomas Kelly, S.J. on August 16, 1808. With the construction of Maguire Hall, university administrators ordered the cemetery to be moved to its present location in 1854, so that it would not be immediately next to the hall. This required the exhumation and relocation of the remains of 46 Jesuits. In 1964, a senior administrator proposed to university president Edward B. Bunn the idea of exhuming the bodies once again and removing them to the cemetery at Woodstock College in Maryland, as doing so would free up approximately one acre of land on the campus that could be used for building. Today, the cemetery is situated in the middle of Georgetown's campus, between the Edward B. Bunn S.J. Intercultural Center and Harbin Hall. , the cemetery is the resting place for 350 Jesuits, 17 of whom served as president of Georgetown University. It is the oldest of the cemeteries owned by the university. As with other Jesuit cemeteries around the world, all of the headstones are uniform.

The building opened in 1914 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places June 18, 1979. Its modest, 1-story Renaissance design is credited to Charles Carroll Soule and features reading rooms on either side of the main entrance. The building also includes a full basement with lecture hall. With History In 1887 the Woman's Christian Temperance Union founded a private library in Caldwell, and before 1909 the city operated a public library. But in 1909 the Caldwell Commercial Club was actively promoting a new library, and Dr. W. C. Stalker, a Caldwell dentist, wrote to the Carnegie Foundation requesting a grant. In April, 1912, Caldwell received a grant of $12,500 under the direction of James Bertram, secretary to Andrew Carnegie and supervisor of the Carnegie library grant process. By December, 1912, excavation for a new library was completed at the northeast corner of 11th Avenue and Cleveland Boulevard, although a construction contract was not signed until October, 1913. Caldwell Carnegie Library opened May 2, 1914, with a ceremony that included an hour of orchestral music and selections by local composer Frederick F. Beale. The library operated until 1976, when it became office space for Caldwell Public Schools. The building was remodeled in 1929 to include a portico and pediment covering the main entrance. In 2014 the city reacquired the building, and a lease agreement was reached with the Caldwell Veterans Council. After an extensive renovation that included removal of the front portico added in 1929, the building reopened in 2017 under the name, Caldwell Veterans Memorial Hall.

The hospital described her work as relating to the \\"genetic causes of deafness in children and therapies that she hoped would one day restore vision.\\" She researched Norrie disease and Usher syndrome, working with charities including Sparks and the Norrie Disease Foundation, and was one of the first colleagues involved in the 100,000 Genomes Project at Genomics England. She died after her bicycle was involved in a collision with a taxi in London.  Education  Bitner-Glindzicz attended Rendcomb College, a boarding school in Gloucestershire, while her parents lived in Hong Kong. She received her medical (MBBS) degree from University College London in 1987, also achieving a first-class intercalated degree. She began to consider a career in clinical genetics upon qualifying, later going on to complete a PhD funded through an MRC Clinical Research Fellowship. Her research interests were the genetic causes of deafness in children and adults, such as Norrie disease and Usher syndrome.  Career  Her research group at the UCL Institute of Child Health, in collaboration with others in Europe, identified a number of genes responsible for syndromic and non-syndromic forms of deafness, including X-linked deafness, the cardio-auditory syndrome, and Usher syndrome. Their research explored the expression and functional effects of mutations identified in these genes in patients in order to understand how they give rise to disease. Bitner-Glindzicz's work on Usher syndrome initiated the National Collaborative Usher Study, a large clinical and molecular study of people with Usher syndrome in the UK, in collaboration with Karen Steel at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. In addition, she was interested in ototoxicity and the mechanisms and genetic basis of this, exploring whether near-bedside genetic testing for mutations predisposing to ototoxicity was feasible. Her work led to improvements in clinical services for patients, including more comprehensive molecular diagnosis for deafness, and specialist clinics in and around London. These included genetic deafness clinics at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital, as well as a joint sensory clinic for patients with dual sensory impairment at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery with Linda Luxon, Andrew Webster, and representatives from Sense. Bitner-Glindzicz was one of the earliest colleagues to be involved with the 100,000 Genomes Project at Genomics England. She published over 175 articles on her research. Alongside her clinical and research work, she supported charities including Sparks and was the driving force behind the setting up of the Norrie Disease Foundation. She was described by Great Ormond Street Hospital as a genuine advocate for her patients and an articulate voice who tirelessly pushed for greater support for children affected by sight and hearing impairments.  Personal life  Maria Bitner-Glindzicz lived in London. She was married, with one daughter and one son.

It was found in the Dabeigou Formation in northeastern China, and isotope dating from the samples overlying the bird-bearing horizon is 127 million years ago. Description Jinguofortis is notable for a mosaic of primitive and advanced characters, including a fused scapulocoracoid and highly reduced manual digits. A fused scapulocoracoid is a plesiomorphical feature that evolved before the origin of limb digits. These two bones become separate and form a suture contact among some reptiles (e.g., lizards, crocodilian), but become fused independently in a few lineages, including non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The tendency for fusion between the coracoid and scapula stems from their developmental origins as a unified homogenous condensation. However, that coalescence becomes detached during chondrogenesis because the osteogenic pattern and/or the differentiation of the preskeletogenic cells is delayed, resulting a sutural contact between the elements. The fusion between the coracoid and scapula is present predominantly in non-avian theropods. However, these two elements are separated in Archaeopteryx, and in more crownward avian clades, but fused in stemward pygostylians confuciusornithids and jinguornithids. The convergently evolved scapulocoracoid in jinguornithids and confuciusornithiforms suggests these basal clades likely reacquired a similar level of osteogenesis present in their non-avian theropod ancestors that is responsible for the co-ossification of the pectoral girdle. Then separation of the coracoid and scapula becomes evolutionarily ‚Äúfixed‚Äù (with a few exceptions in the crown groups) across Ornithothoraces, and underwent further modifications including an ossified sternal keel and formation of the triosseal canal. These developmental changes to the skeleton likely correspond to intense selective pressure to improve flight capability that eventually lead to the musculoskeletal system present among volant crown birds, suggesting developmental plasticity Jinguofortis is morphologically similar to the another stemward avialan Chongmingia (also preserved a fused scapulocoracoid). Differences from Chongmingia include: furcula less robust with a smaller interclavicular angle of 70¬∞; pedal digit I approximately 70% of the length of digit II; and pedal digit II shorter than IV; and these two taxa are separated by approximately seven million years.  Etymology  The name Jinguofortis is a combination of jinguo, from Mandarin (Â∑æÂ∏º), referring to female warrior, and fortis, Latin for brave. Classification Wang et al. (2018) recovered Jinguofortis as a basal pygostylian more derived than Confuciusornithiformes, but more primitive than Sapeornithiformes, and as sister to the previously problematic genus Chongmingia.

It was also called Pella.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, ¬ß D232.3 Location Dium is sometimes identified with Tell el-Ash'ari from the Daraa Governorate in southwestern Syria (see :fr:Tell al-Achari at French Wikipedia). Some associate Dium with the later Capitolias, now Beit Ras in Jordan. The location of Dium is not proven with certainty. According to Ptolemy, the city was southeast of Pella, which is now in modern Jordan, and quite close to it; but its latitude was quite uncertain. Josephus in his retelling of Pompey's march through the area, says he came from Damascus via Dium to Pella, thus putting Dium to the north of Pella. Historical sources Stephanus notes that the city's water was unhealthy. Little is known about the history of the city.

He was a member of the 10 BCT Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea (PEFTOK): 1950-1955. Biography Boni Serrano was born and raised in Armenia, Uson, Masbate on April 4, 1922 to Captain Conrado Serrano who originally hailed from Batangas and wife Juanita Merioles. When the Philippine-Japanese war broke out, his father was reassigned to Bataan to resist Japanese invaders and never returned. Coming back from the Korean War, he was the most eligible bachelor in the country. At 34, he married a Visayan singer/actress Cora Real and had three (3) children: Audie, Bonny Jr. and Johanna. Colonel Bonny Serrano suffered a stroke on January 2, 1970, he had only 20 pesos to his name. At the colonel's wake, former President Ferdinand Marcos was said to glance admiringly at the 48 medals the colonel had in his casket and asked a journalist if it all belong to the late colonel. To which the journalist replied, \\"Yes, Mr. President. It was all his. He earned every single one of them\\". He was buried at Loyola Memorial Park in Marikina City. He was supposed to be at Libingan ng mga Bayani, but his wife chose Loyola because it is near their residence at Blue Ridge, Quezon City. Korean War Exploits  On November 5, 1950, the 10th BCT PEFTOK together with several battalions of the US forces found themselves stuck and unable to advance for several days across the Yalu River due to heavy artillery and sniper fires from the opposite side of the river by the North Korean and Chinese forces. Then 22 years old, Lt. Venancio ‚ÄúBoni‚Äù Serrano led a five-man all-Filipino commando team on a winter night raid, swam across freezing water and captured 77 North Korean soldiers and sympathizers who thought they were surrounded by a much larger army. The \\"gung ho\\" attitude of Lt. Serrano earned him a reputation for fearlessness that made him one of the most colorful Filipino soldiers in the Korean War. His exploits were the basis of an LVN movie, \\"Korea\\", directed by Lamberto V. Avellana and written by Benigno Aquino, Jr. starring Jaime de la Rosa and Nida Blanca. The movie was nominated for the year's FAMAS Best Picture and Best Screenplay for Benigno Aquino, Jr. It won two FAMAS major awards: Best Supporting Actor for Gil de Leon and Best Supporting Actress for Nida Blanca. Honors and Recognitions A road in Quezon City formerly known as Santolan Road was renamed to Bonny Serrano Avenue. A Philippine navy boat, BRP Boni Serrano (PG-111), and a military camp, Camp Bonny Serrano in Masbate were also named in his honor.

Properties  Lithium tetrahydridogallate is easily dissolved in diethyl ether with which it forms a stable complex, making removal of the solvent difficult. Ethereal solutions of LiGaH4 are indefinitely stable if sealed in glass vessels at 0 ¬∞C. Lithium tetrahydridogallate can also be dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and diglyme. Lithium tetrahydridogallate slowly decomposes at room temperature. The decomposition is fast at 70 ¬∞C and the reaction produces lithium hydride, gaseous hydrogen and metallic gallium. The reaction is autocatalyzed by the small particles of metallic gallium being formed.  Reactivity  It can be generally stated that lithium tetrahydridogallate's reactivity is similar to lithium tetrahydridoaluminate's reactivity, but the first is less stable. This is due to the susceptibility of the gallium-hydrogen bonds to hydrolysis. As a consequence LiGaH4 is usually prepared in the absence of air. Lithium tetrahydridogallate violently reacts with water by releasing 4 moles of gaseous hydrogen. It can generally be stated that lithium gallium hydride reacts with protic solvents. Ethereal solutions of LiGaH4 are strongly reductant but less than LiBH4 and LiAlH4. It reacts with primary and secondary amines to release gaseous hydrogen. LiGaH4 reduces acetamide and acetonitrile to ethylamine. Aliphatic acids, aldehydes and ketones are reduced to the corresponding alcohols. Aromatic nitriles, aldehydes, ketones and esters are not reduced. Usage Lithium gallium hydride is often used to prepare other complex gallium hydrides. For example, it can be used to convert tallium trichloride into tallium tetrahydrogallate (which appears as a white solid powder that decomposes above -90 ¬∞C) and silver perchlorate into silver tetrahydrogallate (which appears as an orange-reddish solid powder that rapidly decomposes in ethereal solution above -75 ¬∞C). In the first case the reaction is carried out at a temperature of -115 ¬∞C, in the latter the reaction is carried out at -100 ¬∞C. Reacting lithium gallium hydride and sodium hydride or potassium hydride yields respectively the more stable sodium tetrahydrogallate (decomposes in argon atmosphere at 165 ¬∞C) and potassium tetrahydrogallate (decomposes at about 230 ¬∞C). Both appear as white crystalline powders e can be preserved in the absence of water and moisture for more than one year. Digallane is produced by reaction between lithium tetrahydrogallate and monochlorogallane.

The case was filed as an appeal to an August2016 verdict of the Delhi High Court that ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi exercised \\"complete control of all matters regarding National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi\\", and was heard by the supreme court in November and December2017. The supreme court pronounced its judgment on 4 July2018; it said the lieutenant governor of Delhi had no independent decision-making powers and was bound to follow the \\"aid and advice\\" of the Delhi chief-minister-headed council of ministers of the Government of Delhi on all matters except those pertaining to police, public order and land. The verdict was positively received almost unanimously by politicians from multiple parties. Background  The Government of India Act 1919 and the Government of India Act 1935 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom during the British rule in India classified Delhi as a chief commissioner's province, which meant Delhi was directly ruled by the governor-general through his or her representative, the chief commissioner. The chief commissioner of Delhi used to be an appointed civil servant and reported directly to the governor- general. After India's independence and with the passing of the Government of Part C States Act, 1951, Delhi was classified as a Part C state, with an appointed chief commissioner and an elected chief minister-led council of ministers, which had powers over \\"public utilities, sanitation, water supply et al.\\", that was accountable and responsible to the Delhi Legislative Assembly. but not over 'police', 'public order', 'land' et al. After the passing of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 and the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 on the recommendations of the Fazal Ali-headed States Reorganisation Commission, however, states were reorganised; tier- classification of states was abandoned and top-level subdivisions of India were categorised as either states or union territories (UT),. Delhi was classified a UT; its council of ministers and legislative assembly were dissolved. To give Delhi some elected leadership, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi Act, 1957 was passed by the parliament, establishing the now-trifurcated Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Delhi, however, did not come under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1961, which allowed for legislative assemblies and councils of ministers in some large union territories. There were widespread demands for Delhi to get statehood and more elected representatives in its general governance. As a compromise, the Delhi Metropolitan Council was formed in 1966 with the passing of the Delhi Administration Act, 1966 by the Parliament of India; the council had fifty- sixdirectly-elected members (called councillors) and fivemembers nominated by the newly-created position of lieutenant governor (LG). The council had only advisory powers with regards to legislative proposals, budget proposals and other matters referred to it by the lieutenant governor. The lieutenant governor succeeded the chief commissioner as the administrator of Delhi. The Delhi Metropolitan Council's chairman and deputy chairman acted as speaker and deputy speaker for the council, which elected a chief executive councillor and three executive councillors, much like a state chief minister and council of ministers elected by‚Äîand responsible to‚Äîvidhan sabhas. After widespread demands for a legislative assembly, Delhi was granted further autonomy with the passing of the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 and the Government of National Capital Territory Act, 1991 by the parliament, which established the Delhi Legislative Assembly, allowing for the reintroduction of the chief minister and the council of ministers, replacing the chief executive councillor and executive councillors, respectively.  Premise  Najeeb Jung, the lieutenant governor of Delhi from July 2013 to December 2016 In April2015, the Delhi lieutenant governor (LG) Najeeb Jung said it was not mandatory for him to send files regarding police, public order and land‚Äîhis reserved subjects‚Äîto the chief minister's office. Jung was backed by the Ministry of Home Affairs in May2015 which through a government notification said the LG had the final decision on matters related to police, public order, land and services, adding that the Delhi Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB) could not investigate central government employees. In June2015, while presenting the Delhi budget for approval to the Delhi Legislative Assembly, the deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia‚Äîacting as the finance minister‚Äîannounced the government's intention to raise circle rates on agricultural land throughout the National Capital Territory of Delhi. In August2015, Lieutenant Governor Jung opposed the government's move on circle rates and stayed it. In response, the Delhi government reasserted its intention to raise the circle rate, saying the LG had no say on the matter and was bound to follow the government's aid and advice. In August2015, the Delhi government ordered the creation of a commission of inquiry headed by retired Delhi High Court judge, S. N. Aggarwal to investigate the alleged CNG fitness scam that occurred during the chief ministership of Indian National Congress member Sheila Dikshit. The move was opposed by Jung, who referred the matter to the Ministry of Home Affairs, asking whether it was legal for the government to form a commission of inquiry without his approval. The home ministry later ruled that the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi was \\"not the competent authority to set up\\" an inquiry commission, thus holding that the Delhi government order was \\"legally invalid and void ab initio\\". In December2015, the Delhi government formed a one-member commission of inquiry composed of former solicitor general, Gopal Subramanium to investigate an alleged scam in the Delhi & District Cricket Association. Lieutenant Governor Jung asked for the Government of India's opinion on the legality of the inquiry commission. Chief Minister Kejriwal maintained that the commission of inquiry was legal and asked the Government of India to move the Delhi High Court if it had any issue with the commission's formation. In January2016, the Ministry of Home Affairs informed Jung that the commission was not valid because the Delhi government did not have the power to form an inquiry commission because Delhi was not a state. In August2016, at the Delhi government's behest, a division bench of the High Court of Delhi composed of Chief Justice G. Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath ruled that the LG had \\"complete control of all matters regarding National Capital Territory of Delhi\\". The court also pronounced that all commissions of inquiry set up by the Government of Delhi were illegal, it also ruled that directions issued by the government to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission and the directors nominated by it to the boards of private electricity companies were illegal. Further, the court upheld the May2015 Ministry of Home Affairs notification which ruled that the Delhi ACB could not investigate central government employees. The court, however, said the LG was bound by the aid and advice of the Delhi council of ministers on matters related to the appointments of special public prosecutors. Not satisfied with the high court's decision, the Delhi government ministers Kejriwal, Sisodia and Satyendra Jain decided to move the supreme court. = Civil servants = In May2015, after the Delhi chief secretary and Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer K. K. Sharma went on leave for ten days, Lieutenant Governor Jung ordered Shakuntala Gamlin, IAS officer and principal secretary in charge of Delhi government's departments of power and industries, to officiate as the chief secretary in Sharma's absence. This was opposed by Kejriwal, who accused Gamlin of lobbying for power companies. Gamlin wrote to LG Jung that industries minister Satyendra Jain was putting pressure on her in a matter related to industrial plots. Anindo Majumdar, the Delhi government's principal secretary for its services department and IAS officer, was locked out of his office on the direction of the chief minister's office; the order added that Majumdar had been replaced by Kejriwal's principal secretary and IAS officer, Rajendra Kumar, and that Majumdar had been divested of all of his charges. The order, however, was declared null and void by Lieutenant Governor Jung, saying his approval for transferring Majumdar was not taken. Majumdar subsequently said he opposed the \\"politicisation\\" of senior bureaucratic appointments and refused to follow any \\"unconstitutional\\" orders from Kejriwal. In June2015, seven officers of the Bihar Police joined Delhi ACB on deputation; in opposition to the move, Lieutenant Governor Jung said the ACB was solely under his jurisdiction, resulting in the officers not being assigned any tasks for months. This was followed by Jung naming Indian Police Service (IPS) officer M. K. Meena, an inspector general-ranked Delhi Police joint commissioner heading its New Delhi range, as the ACB's head. This was in contravention to Kejriwal's demands; Kejriwal had appointed deputy inspector general-ranked IPS officer S. S. Yadav as the ACB chief. In June2015, the Delhi High Court refused to set aside Meena's appointment but asked him to act in \\"accordance with law\\". Consequently, the Delhi government reduced Meena's mandate, asking him to look after training and cases undergoing trial. Yadav was asked to handle‚Äîamong other things‚Äîinvestigations and functioning of the agency. On 9 June2015, Jung vetoed Kejriwal's transfer of IAS officer Dharam Pal from the Delhi government's principal secretary in charge of its home and land and buildings departments, citing the April2015 home ministry notification that transferred the power over services to the LG. In August2016, following the Rajender Prashad v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi decision of the Delhi High Court, the Delhi government-appointed Indian Revenue Service officer Tarun Seem, and a former engineer-in-chief of the PWD Sarvagaya Srivastava‚Äînon-IAS secretaries in charge of health and PWD respectively‚Äîwere replaced by Jung with IAS officers Chandraker Bharti and Ashwani Kumar as principal secretaries for health and PWD, respectively. The move was opposed by Kejriwal, who said that deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, had \\"begged\\" Jung to not transfer health and PWD secretaries before March2017. Kejriwal added that files for the transfer of bureaucrats were not shown to him or any other minister of the government. In response, Jung's office said Seem and Srivastava's postings were illegal because they were in contravention with the Government of India's cadre rules, adding that even posting Seem to a position in the Delhi government was illegal because the LG's approval to post him was not taken. In October2016, Jung gave IAS officer Alka Diwan the additional charge of being the Delhi Commission for Women's (DCW) member-secretary. Diwan proceeded to stop salary payments to contractual employees of the DCW and asked the commission's chairperson Swati Maliwal to regularise contractual employees by sending a proposal to the Delhi government's finance department. This led to Kejriwal asking Jung to remove her. Jung then replaced Diwan with another IAS officer Dilraj Kaur, conflicting with the wishes of Kejriwal, who had nominated the commission's legal adviser P. P. Dhal to act as the DCW's officiating member-secretary. This caused Kejriwal to compare Jung with Adolf Hitler. In February2018, Delhi's chief secretary and IAS officer Anshu Prakash was allegedly assaulted by some members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly (MLA) from the AAP. In response, the AAP released a statement saying Prakash said he was answerable to the LG and not MLAs or the CM; the statement also said Prakash had \\"used bad language against some MLAs and [had] left without answering any questions\\".  Proceedings  Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra was a member of the five-judge constitution bench that presided over Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India & Another Building of the Supreme Court of India In 2017, the supreme court heard arguments for fifteen days, beginning on 2 November2017 and finishing on 5 December2017. On 6 December2017, the court reserved its verdict on the matter. The Government of India (GoI) was represented by additional solicitor general Maninder Singh and former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra. The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) was represented by Indian National Congress member, former union minister and senior advocate P. Chidambaram, former solicitor general and senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, senior advocate Satya Mitra, former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Indira Jaising, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan and senior advocate Shekhar Naphade. For GNCTD, Chidambaram argued that Delhi's lieutenant governor was not like a viceroy but just the president's representative and that his or her powers were dependent on the president's pleasure. Chidambaram also argued that per the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, the LG was \\"required to act on the aid and advice\\" of the council of ministers of the Delhi government. Subramanium argued that the Delhi government was not debating the parliament's supremacy but said the legislative assembly also had \\"elbow room\\" in Delhi's governance, adding that the LG was misusing the powers assigned to his or her office to refer differences of opinion to the president. He also said the LG's extraordinary discretion was to be used in exceptional circumstances and not in day-to-day governance of Delhi and that the chief secretary and other officers did not exercise volition on the government's welfare schemes and proposals but simply used them to mechanically defer matters for the lieutenant governor's disposition. For the GoI, Singh argued that the Delhi government's role was limited to that of municipal governance, backing his argument up by saying the Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service and the Delhi Fire Service came under the GoI's jurisdiction rather than that of the Delhi government's. Singh also said that because Delhi did not have its own public service commission, it was not a state. Singh also argued that the GNCTD's executive powers were not binding on the lieutenant governor. Singh also said that because the Article239AA of the Constitution of India came under the section for union territories, Delhi was a union territory. While hearing the case, the supreme court said Delhi's lieutenant governor had more powers than state governors, who were supposed to generally follow the aid and advice of the state chief minister-led council of ministers.  Judgment  The supreme court ruled that according to the Article239AA of the Indian constitution, although the government had to keep him or her informed of its decisions, Delhi's lieutenant governor had no independent decision-making powers and had to follow the aid and advice of the chief-minister-led council of ministers of the Government of Delhi on matters the Delhi Legislative Assembly could legislate on, viz., all items on the State List (items on which only state legislatures can legislate) and the Concurrent List (items on which both the Parliament of India and the state legislatures can legislate) barring police, public order and land. The court added that on matters referred to him/her, the LG was bound to follow the orders of the president. Although the court ruled that the lieutenant governor still had the right to seek the president's opinion in case of a disagreement between him/her and the government, the president‚Äîwho is bound by the aid and advice of the prime minister-headed Union Council of Ministers‚Äîwould be the final authority in case of a conflict, with his or her opinion being binding on both the LG and the Delhi government, it cautioned the LG to use this power only in exceptional circumstances and not in a \\"routine or mechanical manner\\". The court, however, did not define what \\"trivial\\" differences in opinion meant. The court also ruled that \\"[t]here is no room for absolutism and there is no room for anarchism also\\" in the governance of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. At the same time, the supreme court‚Äîciting the report of the Balkrishnan Committeeof1987‚Äîruled that although having a special status, Delhi was not a state; hence, unlike state governors, Delhi's lieutenant governor was not a mere constitutional figurehead but also bore the title of administrator.  Reactions  Delhi's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, called the judgment a \\"big victory\\" for the people of Delhi and democracy Member of the Lok Sabha for North East Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, asked Chief Minister Kejriwal to stop spreading anarchy \\"start following [the] constitution\\" Arvind Kejriwal, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener and chief minister of Delhi welcomed the verdict and said on his Twitter account the ruling was a \\"big victory\\" for democracy and the people of Delhi. AAP member, Delhi's deputy chief minister and minister of finance and education Manish Sisodia said, \\"[o]n behalf of the people of thank the hon'ble Supreme Court wholeheartedly. The people's chosen government can now take decisions for the people of Delhi.\\" Sisodia also said the supreme court verdict \\"did not leave any chance for misinterpretation\\". National Democratic Alliance's largest constituent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the opposite; one of its spokespersons Sambit Patra said the court verdict \\"upheld the constitution\\" and was \\"a decision against anarchy\\". Delhi BJP president and member of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) for North East Delhi Manoj Tiwari asked Kejriwal to stop spreading anarchy and \\"start following [the] constitution\\". A nominated member of the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States) and BJP member Subramanian Swamy said that while the lieutenant governor had to follow Delhi government's decisions, he or she could still oppose any \\"anti-national security or ant-constitutional decision\\" of the government and labelled its political leadership a group of \\" people\\". Three-time Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, a member of the Indian National Congress (INC), the largest constituent party of the United Progressive Alliance, said, \\"[i]f the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor (LG) don't work Delhi will face problems\\". An INC spokesperson and a senior advocate, Abhishek Singhvi said the supreme court ruling was good \\"in principle\\", adding that there was no reason for the lieutenant governor to exercise discretion beyond his or her three reserved powers. Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary and politburo member Sitaram Yechury said there was no reason for governors and lieutenant governors to \\"usurp the rights of elected\\" governments, and that powerful governors and lieutenant governors appointed by the centre were in contravention with the constitution's federal structure. Former attorney general and a supreme court advocate Soli Sorabjee said the supreme court judgment was \\"good\\" and that the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government had to \\"work harmoniously\\", adding that regular confrontation between the two was \\"not good for democracy\\".

History On 10 December 1942, Himmler issued an order to send all Sinti and Roma (Gypsies) to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. A separate camp for Roma was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau known as the Zigeunerfamilienlager (Gypsy Family Camp). The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies had been brought to Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there. One transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with spotted fever. Gypsy prisoners were used primarily for construction work. Thousands died of typhus and noma due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and malnutrition. Anywhere from 1,400 to 3,000 prisoners were transferred to other concentration camps before the murder of the remaining population. On 2 August 1944, the SS cleared the Gypsy camp. A witness in another part of the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The surviving population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers.

Garber is Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Psychology and Human Development at Vanderbilt University. In 1992, Judy Garber received the Boyd McCandless Award from American Psychological Association (APA), Division of Developmental Psychology, for her early research achievements. In 1995, she received the APA David Shakow Young Investigator Award for distinguished contributions to clinical psychology. Garber is co-editor, with Kenneth A. Dodge, of the 1991 volume The Development of Emotion Regulation and Dysregulation, which explores how children learn to cope with both positive and negative feelings and regulate emotions. She previously co-edited the volume Human Helplessness: Theory and Applications, with Martin Seligman.  Biography  Garber completed her undergraduate degree in Psychology and Sociology at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1973, where she graduated summa cum laude. She continued her education at the University of Minnesota, earning her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology in 1987. Garber obtained her license as a clinical psychologist from the State of Tennessee in 1988. She has been a member of the faculty at Vanderbilt University since 1985. From 1988-1993, Garber was a Faculty Scholar supported by the William T. Grant Foundation. Her research has been supported by an Independent Scientist Career Development Award from the National Institutes of Health (2003-2008) and by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. Garber served as Associate Editor of the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology (2002‚Äì2005) and Prevention & Treatment (2002‚Äì2003).  Research  Garber's research examines the etiology, maintenance, prevention, and treatment of mood disorders in children and adolescents. She has studied depression among adolescents and children, the impact of depression on family functioning, and gender differences in depression. In a widely cited study, Garber, along with Nancy S. Robinson and David Valentiner, examined relations between parenting behaviors of mothers with a range of psychopathology (77% with prior history of a mood disorder) and their children's depressive symptoms. The study established maternal acceptance as a protective factor mitigating risk of children's depression, whereas maternal psychological control increased risk of children's depression. Another one of her studies focused on comorbidity of depression with anxiety and substance use disorders in adolescents. In this longitudinal study, Garber evaluated a group of adolescents annually from 6th to 12th grade; the majority of participants in the study had mothers with a history of depression. The study found different patterns of comorbid risk factors in boys and girls: For boys, a prior history of anxiety disorders increased risk of depression; for girls a prior history of substance use increased risk of depression. In a synthesis of research on preventing symptoms of depression in adolescents, Garber and her colleague Jason Horowitz found that the most effective programs were more accurately described as treatment rather than prevention efforts. Garber has been involved in conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a Family Depression Prevention (FDP) program aimed at decreasing the occurrence of depression in children whose parents are depressed through integrated family intervention. Children born to parents with depression have an increased risk for depression and anxiety; hence the FDP hopes to decrease onsets of depressive episodes and lower levels of anxious and depressive symptoms in children and their parents. In research with Janice Zeman, Garber studied factors that influence display rules for controlling or expressing anger, sadness, and pain. They specifically studied how children (first, third, and fifth graders) regulate their emotions based on who is watching, the type of emotion, and their gender. Their main finding was that children were more likely to suppress their displays of emotion when they were with peers in comparison to when they were with their parents or alone.

She is known for creating the theory of femalism and is one of the six most important African feminist theorists.Nkealah, Naomi. \\"(West) African Feminisms and Their Challenges.\\" Journal of Literary Studies 32, no. 2 (2016/04/02 2016): 61-74. Her work has been influential in studies of gender in Africa. She is currently Professor of English and Comparative Literature on the Faculty of Humanities at Rivers State University in Port Harcout, Nigeria. Rivers State University  Education  Opara received her B.A in French at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and went on to receive her diploma in French Studies at The University of Dakar and a certificate in French studies from the University of Tours in France. She received her Ph.D. in English at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. Opara has been an activist for humanities education in Nigeria. In a 2016 inaugural speech at Rivers State University, Opara stated that its Institute on Foundational Studies should be elevated to a full-fledged Faculty of Humanities. She argued that \\"the elevation of the institute to a Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences would facilitate integrative possibilities. In a 2016 interview, she argued that the mastery of language, particularly the English language, is essential to bolster the academic prestige and achievement of higher education institutions in Nigeria: \\"students should take the dictionary as their second bible.\\" At her university, Opara is dubbed \\"the English women\\" due to her expertise in the English language and literature.  Theories  Opara's theoretical work focuses on innovating psychological and sociological feminist frameworks for African women and academics, particularly in analyzing literature. Opara centers the African female experience in the context of postcolonialism, globalization, economic disparity, and traditional African culture. She discusses how African women can subvert generations of sexism, entrenched in all of these systems in a specific context, and describes the appropriate tools for given contexts. Her work belongs to the school of burgeoning African feminist scholarship, which grew as a necessary response to the problem of white feminism and black feminism failing to address the experiences and perspectives of African women on the continent. = Femalism = Opara describes her theory of femalism as a tangible \\"praxis\\" that \\"foregrounds the body while applying psychoanalytical criticism in its negotiation of the gendered subjectivity deemed as culturally and socially constructed.\\" In this theory, she describes the female body as a site of patriarchal abuse and violence on the African continent as the bearer of European colonialism and exploitation. In this way, she centers the female body, which she likens to Mother Nature, and draws a poignant link between the liberation of African women and African nations at large. She argues that: > applying the theory of femalism, a variant of African feminism, the female > body as well as mothering will constitute the systemic site of discourse and > hermeneutics. Parallels will be drawn between the lacerated female body and > the mutilated African nation jostled by wars, poverty, disease, colonialism, > and postcoloniality. Simply put, the feminized African country evokes Mother > Earth, Woman Earthan abstract projection of the African female body. The > scarred body not only aligns with the spiritual in the representation of the > natural and the cosmic but also manifests the dents of a scrambled and > ailing nation. In the mothering of texts, we shall limn some African > writers, transcending to embrace the Satrean concept of freedom. The > existent may,however,in spinning the web of transcendence in a utopian > precinct subordinate reproductive maternity to productive creative art. In a lecture, Opara also described her theory: > By virtue of its analysis of living experiences focused on the body, > femalism is as phenomenological as it is heuristic and composite. Drawing > parallels between the politically scarred African nation and the > socioculturally battered female body, femalism effects a nexus between the > freedom of woman and that of the African continent. The female nurturing > body is considered to be analogous to Mother Africaan embodiment of Mother > Nature. The Metropolitan manipulations of a jolted African nation in the > course of its economic and historical trajectory are likened to the > flagrant, patriarchal abuse of the female body and mind in the quest for a > holistic existence.2016 Inaugural Lecture by Chioma Carol Opara, Rivers > State University, Port Harcourt, January 27, 2016  Gynandrism  Opara defines her theory of gynandrism (a term she uses differently than others) as the male empathy for women found in African literature. She writes that it provides \\"African female subjects as well as female writers a robust leverage in the literary canon.\\" Furthermore, she states that \\"the gynandrist's work proffers a site for implicitly or explicitly censuring sexist normative patterns on the one hand and extolling the merits of the female on the other.\\"  Works  *Beyond the Marginal Land (Belpot, 1999) *English and Effective Communication (Pearl Publishers, 2000) *Her Mother's Daughter (University of Port Harcourt Press, 2004) * \\"Women‚Äôs Perennial Quest in African Writing‚Äù in Dialogue and Universalism (2017) * \\"Not a scintilla of light: Darkness and despondency in Yvonne Vera's Butterfly Burning\\" (2008) * \\"New Perspectives on Women and Community Empowerment in Zaynab Alkali's The Descendants and The Initiates\\" (2011) * ‚ÄúA Drama of Power: Aminata Sow Fall‚Äôs The Beggars‚Äô Strike.‚Äù in Twelve Best Books by African Women.

The first store opened in Malvern in 1917 and the firm went on to have a total of 7 retail outlets, mostly in the south-eastern suburbs. The business was bought out by Myer in 1982. Some stores were then closed and others were opened, including three in Sydney, as the firm changed hands a number of times. At one stage members of the Crittenden family briefly (1989-1990) regained control of the business. One store, located in Toorak, still operated under the Crittenden name in 2018, but with no connection to the family. History Oscar Rupert George Crittenden (1887-1954) was born in South Australia in 1887.Genealogy SA The family came to Victoria soon after and settled on a farm near Lake Hindmarsh. In December 1891, Oscar‚Äôs father, James, aged 33, died after being kicked by a horse, leaving a widow and four children.The Advertiser, 12 March 1891, p.4. The family moved to Melbourne in 1906.The Herald, 10 May 1954, p.5 In that year Oscar became an employee of the Moorabbin Co-operative Society in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.The Argus, 12 May 1910, p.5 He remained in the store in Cheltenham till March 1912, when he left to work in a grocery store owned by David Kidd in Prahran. In 1917, he borrowed ¬£620 from his mother and used it to take over and stock a small grocery store at 138 Glenferrie Road, Malvern. The business then traded as O.R. Crittenden, grocer.The Argus, 18 May 1917, p.3 The staff consisted of one man and a girl, and newspaper advertising state the store was \\"noted for good butter and eggs.\\"Advocate, 7 July 1917, p.20 By August 1930, the business employed 20 people, five of whom took telephone orders for groceries to be delivered in the firm's four vans.Malvern Standard, 7 August 1930, p.5 The store catered to the affluent suburbs of Malvern, Toorak and Armadale and carried imported gourmet foods not widely available elsewhere. Some commodities - such as coffee, dried fruit, butter and bacon - was bought in bulk and repackaged under the Crittenden brand. In 1936 the business opened its second store, taking over an existing business at 569 Malvern Road, Toorak.The Argus, 14 May 1935, p.11. In 1948, the business was registered as a company, O. R. Crittenden Ltd., grocers, with a capital of ¬£25,000.The Age, 23 October 1948, p.4. The firm also began to retail fine wines and spirits in bottle-shops within the grocery stores during the 1930s. Crittendens employed 60 staff at the Malvern and Toorak stores, delivering to 4,000 homes a week by May 1954 when Oscar Crittenden died, aged 66, leaving a widow and four children.The Herald, 10 May 1954, p.5 The business was left to his two sons, John Maxwell (1921-2002) and Douglas Oscar (1923-2014), plus other long term employees of the company. The firm went on to have stores at Bay St, Brighton, Warrigal Rd, Ashwood, Upper Heidelberg Road, Ivanhoe, Bridge Road, Richmond and Lonsdale St, Melbourne. The headquarters for the grocery side of the business was at the Malvern store, under the direction of Jack Crittenden, and included a warehouse behind the store. The liquor side of operations was supervised at the Toorak store by Doug Crittenden who had joined the business in 1946.\\"Rare old vintage\\", The Australian, 1 October 2010 The two other directors of the firm were Max Parsons (1920-2006) and accountant George Davies. The company came to do a considerable amount of bottling, buying hogsheads of wine direct from wineries in Victoria and South Australia, and retailing it under its own label. The company also published annual booklets for customers about the wine they sold.Crittenden's digest of the world‚Äôs finest wines, spirits and liqueurs, O.R. Crittenden Ltd, Malvern (Melbourne), 1952. The firm also had a separate liquor wholesale operation by 1981. Wine and cheese tastings were hosted at particular stores, and events were held to mark the launch of new wine brands. Crittendens became well known in the affluent suburbs of Melbourne. The wealthy and well connected ordered groceries and liquor on the telephone for home delivery and relied on the firm to cater parties and other special events. Customers included former Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies, businessman Sidney Myer and opera singer Dame Joan Hammond. Visitors to Melbourne also employed the services of Crittendens. American actor Gregory Peck lived in Toorak while filming the movie On the Beach (1959) and would place his order by phone.

Episodes generally consist of Davenport, Clements, and a guest offering advice, telling stories, and doing segments, all in a highly satirical, absurdist manner. Guests have included Donald Glover, Ellie Kemper, Aubrey Plaza, Kumail Nanjiani, Nick Kroll, Patton Oswalt, Nick Wiger, and Sharon Horgan.  Background  Clements and Davenport met while writing on the FOX program Allen Gregory, where they quickly established a friendship and established the Reality Show Show podcast on the Earwolf Network. The podcast featured the duo, alongside reality stars such as Survivor winner John Cochran or comedians like Paul F. Tompkins and Anders Holm, humorously analyzing reality shows such as The Challenge, World's Worst Tenants, and Splash. Due to the show's small audience and the hosts' growing disinterest with the premise, Clements and Davenport ended the Reality Show Show after 39 episodes. Two weeks later, on October 8, 2013, the first episode of Hollywood Handbook was released with guest Jake Johnson. In Hollywood Handbook, the hosts play highly-successful versions of themselves, presenting the podcast as \\"an insider's guide to kicking butt and dropping names in the red-carpet-lined back hallways of this industry we call showbiz\\". Initially, the show consisted of Clements and Davenport doing segments such as \\"The Teaser Freezer\\", wherein they would comment on a trailer for an upcoming movie, followed by an interview with the guest which included audience questions during the \\"Popcorn Gallery\\" segment. In recent years, however, the show has adopted a much looser format, featuring less planned segments and more interactions with the guests and Earwolf staff.  Reception  Hollywood Handbook has been featured on Vulture's best-of comedy podcast list in 2015, 2016, and 2017, ranking seventh, second, and fourth respectively. In 2019, Vulture recognized two episodes of Hollywood Handbook as some of the \\"best episodes of the year\\". It also ranked third in Pastes 2017 list, and second in The A.V. Clubs 2015 reader's poll. Writer and critic Nathan Rabin has written many articles for Vulture and The A.V. Club about episodes of the show, praising one as \\"anti-comedy for the ages\\". Notable fans and guests of the show include Tom Scharpling, Paul F. Tompkins, Julie Klausner, and Paul Scheer.  Spin-offs  On June 14, 2017, Clements, Brett Morris, and actor and comedian Ben Rodgers launched the first season of the Stitcher Premium series Hollywood Masterclass which satirizes MasterClass lectures. The show's second season began August 29, 2018. On January 31, 2018, Clements and Davenport launched Hollywood Handbook: The Pro Version, a 30-minute version of the show featuring interactions between the duo and members of the staff such as \\"Chef Kevin\\" and \\"Engineer Brett\\", as well as segments like the aforementioned \\"Teaser Freezer\\". The show is posted every Wednesday on Stitcher Premium. It was called one of the \\"best new comedy podcasts of 2018\\" by Rolling Stone.

Early life and education Irwin was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1928. He began his education at Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts, after which point he entered Hofstra College to pursue a career in music. He then transferred to the College of Puget Sound where he earned an undergraduate degree in biology with minors in music and history in 1950, and a subsequent degree in education. Irwin was then a Fulbright teacher of botany and zoology at Queen's College in British Guiana from 1952 until 1956. During that time he was a coorespondent from TIME magazine. In 1956 he began work on his PhD in taxonomic botany at the University of Texas, earning his degree in 1960. The New York Botanical Garden Irwin first began his association with the New York Botanical Garden while a graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin. During his time as a PhD student, Irwin traveled to Brazil and collected botanical specimens on behalf of NYBG, with the bulk of his collecting as a student taking place in 1958. Irwin's field notebooks from his time in Brazil (in total eight expeditions between the 1950s and the 1970s) are held by the Archives of the New York Botanical Garden, along with earlier notebooks documenting his time in Guyana and notebooks for an expedition to Surinam between 1960 and 1972. Irwin's vouchers were also deposited at NYBG and many can be viewed through the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium. Irwin was hired as a Research Associate at NYBG in 1960, promoted to Associate Curator in 1963, Curator and Administrator of the Herbarium in 1966, Head Curator in 1968, Executive Director in 1971, and President in 1973, a position that he held until 1979 to embark on a sabbatical to pursue scientific research and writing projects.

The park contains two sections, one on the floodplains of the Desna, the other in the southern region of the Bryansk forest on the Russian border. The area is relatively clean, ecologically, being clear of the radiological zone and being in a non-industrial region. The park is in the administrative district of Seredyna-Buda Raion in Sumy Oblast. A component of the park is a Ramsar wetland site of international importance \\"Desna River Floodplains\\". It is also component of the Desniaksyi Biosphere Reserve, designated in 2009 by the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) Reserve Programme. Topography Desna-Starohutskyi sits in the river valley of middle Desna, about 300 km upstream from where the Desna meets the Dnieper River near Kyiv. The terrain in the park was laid down by glacial deposits of sand and gravel in the last ice age. The flat landscape features rivers and oxbow lakes of the meandering Desna, and also extensive marshes and swamps. The location is on the eastern edge of the Polesia region of forest and lowland marshes that reaches from Poland in the west, to the Central Russian Uplands in the east. Meadow and forest in Desna-Starohutskyi Climate and ecoregion The climate of Desna-Starohutskyi is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The park is in the Central European mixed forests ecoregion. Flora and fauna The western section of the park on the Desna (\\"Pridesniansk \\"), features relatively pure water, as the Desna has not been dammed at this point. The area includes wide meadows with tall grasses, alder swamps, and forest stands of ash, oak, and aspen. The eastern, (\\"Starohutska\\"), section of the park includes the southern part of the Bryansk Forest that extends into Russia. The Starohutska section is mostly pine forest, with few stands of broad leaf trees. Typical large mammals are elk, roe deer, wild swine, squirrel, hare and wolf. In recent years, beavers have reappeared in the marshy areas. Bird life is noteworthy, with 134 species recorded as breeding in the park. The aquatic communities include the vulnerable Sterlet, and the near-threatened Eurasian otter. Public use There are recreational facilities in each of the main sections, with heated cabins available for rent, boats, fishing, and campsites. Park administration requests checking in with the visitor center to register and for review of the park's rules. In the Pridesnaya section there is an educational ecological trail, \\"Visnikska Desna\\", that works its way through the various habitats of the Desna floodplain terraces. There is a visitor center with library and videos, and park scientists sponsor educational programs for local school groups.

History Ventec Life Systems was founded in Bothell, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, by Doug DeVries. According to the New York Times, Ventec is known for its VOCSN model, which received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2017. The VOCSN is the size of a large toaster oven, and combines a number of functions that had previously been performed by several different machines to pump air into the lungs, suction out secretions, and produce oxygen when a central oxygen line is not available. It is used in critical-care hospital units and in home care. Chris Kiple is the CEO of Ventechttps://www.wibc.com/news/coronavirus/pence-tours-gm-plant-on-a-thank- you-mission/ and the Chief Strategy Officer of the company is Chris Brooks.https://www.autoblog.com/2020/03/27/gm-ventec-ventilators-fema-balks- at-cost/ VOCSN Ventec developed the VOCSN unified respiratory system, which is a portable personal medical device that includes a ventilator, 6 L/min portable oxygen concentrator, cough assist, suction, and nebulization therapies for the patient. The name of the device is an acronym derived from the names of these five functions. It received FDA approval in April 2017, and began to roll out in 2018. The weight of the device is about eighteen pounds. It is designed for use by both children and adults to treat conditions such as muscular degeneration, spinal cord injury, and underdeveloped lungs. As of 2017 it was medically cleared for use in the US and Japan. On March 21, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, General Motors announced a partnership with Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators. The partnership is expected to build 10,000 ventilators per month at GM's facilities in Kokomo, Indiana, using Ventec's VOCSN platform. Ventec is one of twelve worldwide manufacturers of ventilators. According to NBC News, its ventilators are transportable and include advanced data monitoring, as well as internal controls to make the most of oxygen consumption. The five-in-one technology compresses 55 pounds of equipment into 18 pounds, and it has a nine hour battery life.

This response encompasses assessment and repairs to buildings and infrastructure, removal of debris, and providing public health services. Hurricane responders may be exposed to many hazards such as chemical and biological contaminants, and injuries from work activities.  Activities  Personnel and equipment from the alt=Photograph of the inside of a cargo jet, containing people in military field uniforms, equipment, and trucks Activities performed by hurricane responders include assessment, restoration, and demolition of buildings; removal of debris and waste; repairs to land-based and maritime infrastructure; and providing public health services including search and rescue operations. Maritime response activities include checking for submerged obstructions and updating nautical charts for affected port areas; aerial survey missions to assess damages to affected areas to provide information for emergency responders; identification and survey of vessels or containers that may be leaking hazardous materials; and assessment of environmental impacts of contaminants in coastal and estuarine waters, including the health risk of eating fish and shellfish. Hurricane response requires coordination between federal, tribal, state, local, and private entities. An Incident Command System is used in the United States to coordinate activities between entities involved in disaster response. According to the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, potential response volunteers should affiliate with established organizations and should not self-deploy, so that proper training and support can be provided to mitigate the danger and stress of response work.  Health and safety hazards  alt=A photograph of two men walking on a flooded street towards a group of men in rafts in the background Hurricane responders may be exposed to chemical and biological contaminants. These include sewage and stored industrial or household chemicals, human remains, and mold growth encouraged by flooding. Proper personal protective equipment, possibly including respirators, can help mitigate these hazards. In addition, fire ants are often disturbed during hurricanes and can float along in floodwaters, leading to the hazards of bites and stings. Asbestos and lead may be present in older buildings, and radon may be a concern in some areas. Common injuries arise from falls from heights, such as from a ladder; trips, slips, and falls from level surfaces; and use of chainsaws. There is a danger of electrocution from flooded areas, including from backfeed from portable generators. In addition, the use of generators, heaters, or stoves can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning if used indoors or close to an open window or air conditioner. Motor vehicle safety is important as most responders ride in motor vehicles, or may be required to direct traffic. Violence and looting is another hazard. Injuries may also result from entering buildings with compromised structural integrity, noise, unexpected start-up or release of stored energy by machines or equipment, impact to the eyes or face, manual lifting, animal bites, poisonous plants, and sunburn. Long and irregular shifts may lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, increasing the risk of injuries. Additionally, heat stress is a concern as workers are often exposed to hot and humid temperatures, wear protective clothing and equipment, and have physically difficult tasks. Heat stress may increase the risk of other injuries due to sweaty palms, fogged-up safety glasses, mental confusion, and dizziness. Pre-exposure and post-exposure medical monitoring is recommended to establish fitness for and identify adverse effects from response work. Workers may experience mental stress associated with a traumatic incident.

Their children were: David Barkley (1869‚Äì1875); an unnamed male child, who was born in 1870 but did not survive infancy; and Mabel Clare (1874‚Äì1946). For a decade, James Mitchell pursued the trade of plastering before becoming a merchant.

Biography He graduated from the Military Academy in Belgrade. From 1911 he was the supervising officer of the mountainous headquarters in the Ra≈°ka border region, next to the Ottoman Empire.He was a liaison officer in touch with other commanders who were operating behind enemy lines. His task was to transfer arms and men across the border to Turkish territory.In August 1912, he joined the secret society called the Black Hand. He died at Siva Stena during the Battle of Kaymakchalan while commanding the 2nd Volunteer Battalion. The battle was fought between 12 and 30 September 1916, when the Serbian army managed to capture the peak of Prophet Ilija while pushing the Bulgarians towards the town of Mariovo. His courage was on display when he single-handedly charged a machinegun nest, receiving a bullet wound in the head. After receiving a second wound in the head, he fell unconscious, and as soon as he came to, Pantiƒá urged his men to leave their cover and counterattack by yelling the famous words, \\"Go!

The Changhua County Government named it a historic heritage site in 2011.  History  An advertisement for Kaobinge published in 1942. =Empire of Japan= On a visit to Taipei, Wang Bing-chi visited the . After he returned to Changhua, Wang Bing-chi asked his father Wang Jung-tou and Yang Hsin-yen to finance a similar project in his hometown. Further funded by a credit cooperative in Changhua, construction began in 1937. The second floor began construction on 13 January 1938, and the entire building was completed in May of that year. The project was led by a construction firm based in Changhua. The structure was designed by Chang Shih-fan. The lead architect was Wei Lin-mu. The two-story building was built in a modern architecture style. A portion of the exterior resembles a ship. The building housed a restaurant, Kaobinge (), which counted Loa Ho and Tu Tsung-ming as frequent patrons. While Kaobinge was in business, the first floor served as a kitchen and staff living quarters. Patrons were seated on the second floor, which included a stage. Due to the Second Sino-Japanese War effort, Kaobinge became less profitable, and was closed roughly five years after it opened. The building was acquired by the Japanese-run predecessor of the Taiwan Railways Administration. Plans to make it a railway hospital were not immediately implemented, and the building alternately housed a dormitory and office building. =Republic of China= In 1950, the building was repurposed as a medical facility. It became the Changhua Railway Hospital in 1971, which closed in 1984. The premises were then leased to a wedding studio, followed by a cafe. In 2008, demolition of the building was discussed, to create a larger parking lot for Changhua railway station. Three years later, the Changhua County Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau named the building a county-level historic heritage site. A restoration project funded jointly by the Ministry of Culture, Changhua Cultural Affairs Bureau, and the Taiwan Railways Administration started in 2016 and was finished by 2018.

Ha! Pyramid () is a contemporary art monument commemorating the Saguenay flood of 1996. Located in the district of La Baie in Saguenay, Quebec, the pyramid was named after the nearby Ha! Ha! River. Conceived as a form of therapy to help residents recover from the traumatic events of the flood, it is covered in 3,000 yield signs, based on the similarity of the French words for \\"to yield\\" (c√©der ) and \\"to help each other\\" (s'aider ). History The pyramid in 2008 The neighbourhood of Grande-Baie suffered heavy damage from the flood of 1996. Ten people died and between 12,000 to 16,000 residents were displaced. Some 500 to 800 buildings were destroyed, more than 1,200 damaged, and damage estimates ranged from . The project was therefore seen as a form of therapy to help residents recover from the traumatic events of the flood, and to revitalise the area by adding a new tourist and artistic attraction. A group of local citizens formed The Restoration Committee of Ha! Ha!, put forward the idea for a new art installation, and requested help from local artist Jean-Jules Soucy. Soucy submitted a contemporary design that would express both \\"originality and a sense of humor\\". The project called for the full restoration of the Ha! Ha! River, on whose banks the project is situated, and the construction of a new public park in the area where a bridge once stood, which would contain the high pyramid and an area for public performances. The project was estimated to cost $2 million, and was completed in several stages. The Ha! Ha! park was completed in 1998 for a total of $1.3 million, and was officially inaugurated during the 2000 Festival of Lac-Saint-Jean. Financing was achieved through a public-private partnership, including a fund-raising campaign that netted $300,000. Finally, in 2005, a public square was completed next to the project at a cost of $35,000. Description The pyramid is a high aluminum structure covered in 3,000 yield signs with standard reflective coating. The design of the signs were noted by Soucy to be similar to the Greek delta (Œî). The signs are meant to encourage people to help one another, as the French word for \\"yield\\", c√©der, is pronounced the same as s'aider, meaning \\"to help each other\\". A central staircase provides access to an observation deck which allows views of the Haha portion of the surrounding Saguenay River valley. On the pyramid's interior walls there are a number of plaques dedicated to local families engraved with the names of those who were directly affected by the flood. Recognition In 2007 the pyramid was one of three finalists for the \\"new development prize\\" from Les Arts et la Ville, a nonprofit organisation that supports the artistic and cultural life of smaller municipalities.

History Established by French schoolteacher Jacques Bousquet, it was first published in January 1943, and received its foothold in the French press as other children's publications closed due to paper rationing;Tufts, p. 23. the Nazi authorities officially allowed Le T√©m√©raire to use paper,Tufts, p. 24. while other publications had not. Clare Tufts, the author of \\"Vincent Krassousky-Nazi Collaborator or Na√Øve Cartoonist?\\", stated that it had \\"quality graphics\\" and that the paper and ink used were \\"good\\". Therefore it, according to Tufts, \\"made a significant impact\\" as it, especially in the Paris metropolitan area, had a \\"monopoly\\" in the youth comics market. The founder had associations with the group Jeunes du Mar√©chal. The writers and editors were all French, and the publisher, which was located in the same building as the publication of the Nazi occupying authorities,Tufts, p. 24. was, according to the accounting books, funded entirely with French capital. Author Pascal Ory in his book Le Petit Nazi Illustr√© stated that the Nazi occupying forces, in Tufts's words, \\"approved or at least tolerated\\" the publication even though its creators were French. The publication had 38 regular issues and three special issues, and its circulation was 200,000. Its comics fell in line with Nazi ideology, promoting racial purity, praising the Nazi Aryan ideal by making those characters protagonists, and denigrating the enemies of Nazi Germany, including Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as people of non-Aryan backgrounds, as they were made antagonists. The publication sponsored 70 clubs which organized recreational activities for children. One of them, \\"Le Cercle des T√©m√©raires,\\" had a membership in the thousands. From the beginning the comics of Vincent Krassousky, with the Vica sailor character, were published in Le T√©m√©raire, with all issues having full Vica stories except for Issue 12. According to Tufts, the Vica comics were \\"far less offensive\\" compared to much of the remaining content.Tufts, p. 25. Publication ended on August 1, 1944.

A tax practitioner, sometimes referred to as a tax professional, is generally an attorney, CPA or enrolled agent. OPR‚Äôs vision, mission, strategic goals and objectives support effective tax administration by ensuring all tax practitioners, tax return preparers, and other third parties in the tax system adhere to professional standards and follow the law. OPR‚Äôs goals include the following: (1) Increase awareness and understanding of Circular 230 and OPR through outreach activities, (2) Apply the principles of due process to the investigation, analysis, enforcement and litigation of Circular 230 cases and (3) Build, train and motivate a cohesive OPR team. OPR publishes all disciplinary actions in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). Published sanctions include censure, suspension or disbarment from practice before the IRS. According to former OPR director Karen Hawkins, \\"The focus has been on roadkill - the easy cases of tax practitioners who are non-filers.\\" In FY 2018, OPR opened 2,672 new suspected practitioner misconduct cases. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/fy_2018_opr_annual_report.pdf Referrals by IRS employees OPR provides guidance and feedback to field/agency sources regarding essential referral criteria for each relevant Circular 230 provision. Any IRS employee who believes a practitioner has violated any provision in Circular 230 is required to make a written report to the OPR (31 C.F.R. Section 10.53 (a)). Former OPR director Karen Hawkins encouraged IRS employees to make discretionary referrals because such referrals could expose a practitioner's pattern of behavior. Search for disciplined tax professionals OPR's disciplinary look-up chart contains searchable information regarding censures of practitioners for Circular 230 misconduct and suspensions and disbarments of individuals from practice before the IRS. The list contains basic information on over 3,000 OPR censures, suspensions, disbarments, and miscellaneous restrictions on practice, such as permanent injunctions and denials of limited practice to unenrolled tax return preparers due to misconduct. The list covers the last 25 years, which aligns with the OPR‚Äôs record-retention requirement. The list provides a practitioner's last name, first name, middle initial (if applicable), city, state, designation, disciplinary sanction, effective date, ending date (the practitioner is now in good standing and may represent taxpayers before the Service).

In most eukaryotic cells, DNA is arranged in multiple linear chromosomes. In contrast, most prokaryotic cells generally contain a singular circular chromosome. However, linear chromosomes are not limited to eukaryotic organisms; some prokaryotic organisms have linear chromosomes as well, such as Borrelia burgdorferi. In fact, experiments in which the circular chromosomes of prokaryotic organisms have been linearized have demonstrated that some prokaryotes can maintain viability even with linear chromosomes. In general, the factors which led to the evolution of linear chromosomes in eukaryotes are not well understood. One potential selective pressure in favor of linear chromosomes relates to the size of an organism's genome: linear chromosomes may make transcription and replication of large genomes easier. In an organism with a very large genome, circular chromosomes could potentially cause problems relating to torsional strain. Linear chromosomes are also in some ways disadvantageous or problematic, one of the biggest potential issues being the end replication problem. This is a phenomenon which occurs due to the directionality of DNA replication enzymes, resulting in the gradual loss of genetic material at the ends of linear chromosomes after each subsequent cycle of cell and DNA replication. In order to mitigate the negative effects of this gradual loss of genetic material, eukaryotes have evolved repetitive, non- coding terminal DNA sequences known as telomeres on the ends of chromosomes. These repetitive, non-coding sequences are lost instead of important coding DNA, and they are replenished using enzymes known as telomerases. However, telomeres do not fully prevent the loss of coding DNA at the terminal ends of linear chromosomes. In fact, the eventual loss of coding DNA in cellular lines within an organism is thought to play a role in senescence. Furthermore, evidence suggests that telomeres can be unstable and can be prone to mutations which lead to tumor development. Mutations which lead to the constitutive activity of telomerase can result in the loss of cellular mortality in tumor cell lines, which is associated with the development of cancer.

He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from Harvard University in 1967, his Master's (1968) and PhD (1970) degrees from the University of Chicago, and did postdoctoral work at the University of Paris (1971) and the University of California, Berkeley (1972). After 30 years of research in theoretical physical chemistry, contributing notably to the fields of gas- phase photophysics, optical properties of simple liquids, and the statistical physics of complex fluids, he started a biophysics laboratory with Charles Knobler in 2002 to investigate the physical aspects of viral infectivity.  Education and career  Gelbart's early interest in science was inspired by his time as an undergraduate researcher in the molecular spectroscopy group of William Klemperer at Harvard. As a graduate student at the University of Chicago, with his mentors Stuart A. Rice, Karl Freed, and Joshua Jortner, he developed the modern theory of non-radiative processes (\\"radiationless transitions\\") in molecular photophysics. He was a US National Science Foundation/NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at the, University of Paris in 1971, and a Miller Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley in 1972, during which time he switched fields and formulated a general theory of collision-induced optical properties of simple fluids. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Chemistry, at UC Berkeley in 1972, continuing his researches on the quantum mechanical theory of molecular spectroscopy and on the statistical mechanical theory of intermolecular and multiple light scattering in liquids away from and near their critical points. He moved to UCLA as Associate Professor of Chemistry in 1975, and was promoted to full Professor in 1979 and to Distinguished Professor in 1999. He was Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA from 2000-2004 and has been a member of UCLA's California NanoSystems Institute since 2004 and of its Molecular Biology Institute from 2008. At UCLA he became a leader in the then-emerging fields of \\"complex fluids\\" and \\" soft matter physics\\". Shortly after moving there he began a 40-year collaboration with Avinoam Ben-Shaul on statistical- thermodynamic models of liquid crystal systems, polymer and polyelectrolyte (in particular, DNA) solutions, and colloidal suspensions, and on the self- assembly theory of micelles, surfactant monolayers, and biological membranes.See in review During a sabbatical year in 1998-99 at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in UC Santa Barbara and at the Curie Institute in Paris, Gelbart became deeply intrigued by viruses and over the course of the next several years, with his UCLA colleague Charles Knobler, established a laboratory to investigate simple viruses outside their hosts and isolated in test tubes. Early results included: the first measurement of pressure inside DNA viruses, establishing that it is as high as tens of atmospheres depending on genome length and ambient salt concentrations; and the demonstration that capsid proteins from certain viruses are capable of complete in vitro packaging of a broad range of lengths of heterologous RNA.See review: This work, along with that of several other groups in the United States and Europe, helped launch the field of \\"physical virology\\". Most recently he moved his viruses from test tubes to host cells, and from wildtype viruses to artificial viruses and virus-like particles, engineered for purposes of delivering self- replicating RNA genes, RNA vaccines, and therapeutic microRNA to targeted mammalian cells.  Awards  He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society for \\"for his many contributions to the light scattering and phase transition properties of simple fluids, liquid crystals, and surfactant solutions\\". He has received the 1991 Lennard-Jones Prize of the British Royal Society of Chemistry, a 1998 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 2001 Liquids Prize of the American Chemical Society, election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009, and endowed lectureships at the Curie Institute (Paris), the University of Leeds (England), Case Western Reserve University, Cornell University, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and the University of Texas at Austin. At UCLA he won the 1996 University Distinguished Teaching Award, served as Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry (2000-2004), and was awarded the Glenn T. Seaborg Medal in 2017. In 2016, his 70th birthday was honored by an international symposium on \\"Self Assembly, from Atoms to Life\\" at the Meso-American Center for Theoretical Physics, and by a \\"festschrift\\" issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.

He was conscripted into the Waffen-SS and stationed at the Auschwitz concentration camp from 1942 until 1945. There he participated in mass murder by making selections and beat and murdered prisoners on his own initiative. After the war, Baretzki settled in West Germany. He was the lowest-ranking of the twenty-four defendants in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials. His murders were sensationalized in the German press, taking the focus off of the systematic crimes of the Nazi regime. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment and eight years for participating in the murder of more than 8,000 people. Baretzki expressed regret for his actions, testified against his former superiors, and committed suicide in prison. Early life Stefan Baretzki was born in 1919 into a Bukovina German family in CernƒÉu»õi (Czernowitz), then part of the Kingdom of Romania. Hermann Langbein, an Austrian historian and Auschwitz political prisoner, noted that Baretzki was born in the same town as Viktor Pestek, an Auschwitz guard executed by the Nazis because he helped Siegfried Lederer, a Czech Jew, to escape. Baretzki had only an elementary school education and never spoke German well. He was conscripted into the SS in 1941, after an announcement in his church encouraged him to resettle in Breslau, then part of Germany, as part of the Heim ins Reich (\\"Back home to the Reich\\") policy of resettling Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) in Greater Germany. Auschwitz Baretzki served as a block officer in Auschwitz II- Birkenau from 1942 to 1945. With other Volksdeutsche guards, he was shown antisemitic propaganda films such as Jud S√º√ü and Ohm Kr√ºger after work. Encouraged by the films, guards would beat up Jewish prisoners the following morning. Baretzki stated at his trial that when Volksdeutsche guards asked why prisoners were sent to Auschwitz, they were told that all of them were dangerous criminals convicted of sabotage. When asked how small children could be guilty, it was explained to the guards they were too uneducated to understand, and it would be clear later. They were also told that all things authorized by Adolf Hitler were legal. Baretzki claimed not to believe these assurances and considered going into hiding when he went to Romania on leave in 1943. He did not do so because, according to him, he feared repercussions against his family. According to Rebecca Wittmann, Baretzki's admission that he knew that the mass murder of Jews was illegal sealed his conviction. Baretzki on the ' during a selection. He is at the right of the photo, carrying a baton that he frequently used to beat inmates. At his trial, Baretzki described how he treated inmates who had been transferred from subcamps because they had become too starved or ill to work. He did not allow any of them to register into the camp. He held them instead in a quarantine block until they died, not even allowing them to enter the barracks because the starving prisoners would create a mess. Baretzki was known to practice a sport he called the \\"rabbit hunt\\", where prisoners were ordered to remove their caps. Anyone who did not do so quickly enough was beaten and shot while \\"trying to escape\\". However, at other times, he attempted to help inmates, such as bringing water to women confined to \\"Mexico\\", an especially primitive section of the camp lacking the most basic facilities. SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Johann Schwarzhuber, the commandant of Auschwitz II-Birkenau, thwarted these efforts. Schwarzhuber told Baretzki that he should not have any compassion for Jewish prisoners. In the spring of 1944, Viktor Pestek was arrested after returning to the camp and attempting to rescue additional inmates. Baretzki claimed that he had seen other SS men beating Pestek. Ryszard Henryk Kordek, a prisoner, contradicted this saying that Baretzki had raised the alarm over Pestek's return, and was one of the guards who beat him. During the liquidation of the Theresienstadt family camp in July 1944, Baretzki asked his superiors to spare the lives of the children imprisoned there. A selection was held for teenage boys, and some were saved, but Franz Lucas intervened to prevent saving the girls. Asked to explain his actions at his trial, Baretzki stated that he had often attended theatrical performances at the children's block in the family camp. After the evacuation of Auschwitz, Baretzki was transferred to the SS division \\"30 January\\" and captured by Soviet forces in early May. Released on 17 August, he settled near Koblenz and worked in a coal shop. In 1953, he was briefly imprisoned for assault; two years later, he was fined for resisting arrest. In 1956, he was fined again for assault. He never married. Trial A warrant for Baretzki's arrest was issued in on 3 March 1960, and he was apprehended a month later. He was the lowest-ranking of twenty-four men indicted at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials; his defense attorneys were Eugen Gerhardt and Engelbert Jorschko. Because the defendants were tried under ordinary criminal law, a distinction was made between individual acts of cruelty, which were punished as murder, and participation in the program of mass extermination, which was only charged as being an accomplice to murder. As one of the more brutal SS guards, Baretzki could be proved to have murdered on his own initiative and therefore received a harsher sentence than many of his superiors. In the German press, gruesome stories of the brutality of individual guards, including Baretzki, came to overshadow the larger point of prosecutor Fritz Bauer: that every SS guard, even those who did not personally commit shocking acts of sadism, was a voluntary participant in the system of extermination. Baretzki was found guilty of five counts of murder: he beat a starving prisoner to death and, on 21 June 1944, drowned four prisoners in a water tank of section BIId. He was also convicted as an accomplice to the mass murder of Jews on eleven occasions. He assisted in the murder of at least 3,000 people by participating in the liquidation of the Theresienstadt family camp in March 1944. During five selections on the Judenrampe, he was an accomplice to at least 1,000 murders. On five occasions he was found to have assisted in block selections where worn-out inmates were selected for death; in each of these incidents, more than 50 people were murdered. In addition, the court found that he was guilty of three other crimes. These included punishing prisoners in section BIId of the camp who attempted to communicate with inmates in other parts of the camp by forcing them to perform strenuous exercises, during which he shot at least five prisoners. The court did not assign additional punishment for these crimes but used them as further evidence of Baretzki's brutality. Otto Dov Kulka and other witnesses testified that Baretzki killed other prisoners, but he was not charged with these murders. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and eight years. Because the court described him as a \\"simpleton\\" and \\"less intelligent than all the other defendants\\", Baretzki's admission that he knew that the mass murder of Jews was a crime was used to prove that the other defendants knew that their actions were criminal as well. He was the only defendant to testify against other defendants, offering damning testimony about the conditions at the camp. About the SS doctor Franz Lucas, who initially denied having participated in selections, Baretzki stated, \\"I was not blind when Dr. Lucas made selections on the ramp. ... Five thousand men he sent to the gas [chambers] in half an hour, and today he wants to stand as a savior.\\" Baretzki said that Lucas changed his behavior during the final months of the war only when it was clear that Germany would lose. As a result, other witnesses came forward stating that Lucas had selected inmates to live or die. Lucas eventually admitted having done so on four occasions, but on orders and against his personal conviction. The court found that he had participated in murder. Later life Baretzki also testified against , who was in charge of the propaganda department at Auschwitz. When he was dismissed from a government post in education following public outcry, Knittel sued the government to be reinstated. Called as a witness, Baretzki testified that Knittel had said that Jewish women and children had to be murdered because they were an inferior race. According to Baretzki, \\"We learned how to murder from Herr Knittel's lectures\\". While in prison, he helped Langbein with his research into the camp. Baretzki told him that he hoped that Auschwitz would never happen again. According to Langbein, he accepted his guilt and said that serving jail time was the only thing he could do for the prisoners he had murdered. Baretzki said that he appealed his sentence only because of pressure by his fellow defendants on whom he was financially dependent for his legal fees. The appeal failed, and Baretzki committed suicide in jail in Bad Nauheim on 21 June 1988.

They are found in diving chambers, hyperbaric treatment chambers, and submarines. The use in hyperbaric treatment chambers is usually to supply an oxygen rich treatment gas which if used as the chamber atmosphere, would constitute an unacceptable fire hazard. In this application the exhaust gas is vented outside of the chamber. In saturation diving chambers and surface decompression chamber the application is similar, but a further function is a supply of breathable gas in case of toxic contamination of the chamber atmosphere. This function does not require external venting, but the same equipment is typically used for supply of oxygen enriched gases, so they are generally vented to the exterior. In submarines the function is to supply a breathable gas in an emergency, which may be contamination of the ambient internal atmosphere, or flooding. In this application venting to the interior is both acceptable and generally the only feasible option, as the exterior is typically at a higher pressure than the interior, and external venting is not possible by passive means.  Function  Side view of BIBS mask supported by straps =Externally vented BIBS= These are systems used to supply breathing gas on demand in a chamber which is at a pressure greater than the ambient pressure outside the chamber. The pressure difference between chamber and external ambient pressure makes it possible to exhaust the exhaled gas to the external environment, but the flow must be controlled so that only exhaled gas is vented through the system, and it does not drain the contents of the chamber to the outside. This is achieved by using a controlled exhaust valve which opens when a slight over-pressure relative to the chamber pressure on the exhaust diaphragm moves the valve mechanism against a spring. When this over-pressure is dissipated by the gas flowing out through the exhaust hose, the spring returns this valve to the closed position, cutting off further flow, and conserving the chamber atmosphere. A negative or zero pressure difference over the exhaust diaphragm will keep it closed. The exhaust diaphragm is exposed to the chamber pressure on one side, and exhaled gas pressure in the oro-nasal mask on the other side. The supply of gas for inhalation is through a demand valve which works on the same principles as a regular diving demand valve second stage. Like any other breathing apparatus, the dead space must be limited to minimise carbon dioxide buildup in the mask. In some cases the outlet suction must be limited and a back-pressure regulator may be required. This would usually be the case for use in a saturation system. Use for oxygen therapy and surface decompression on oxygen would not generally need a back-pressure regulator. When an externally vented BIBS is used at low chamber pressure, a vacuum assist may be necessary to keep the exhalation backpressure down to provide an acceptable work of breathing. The oro-nasal mask may be interchangeable for hygienic use by different people. Some models are rated for pressures up to 450 msw. The major application for this type of BIBS is supply of breathing gas with a different composition to the chamber atmosphere to occupants of a hyperbaric chamber where the chamber atmosphere is controlled, and contamination by the BIBS gas would be a problem. This is common in therapeutic decompression, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, where a higher partial pressure of oxygen in the chamber would constitute an unacceptable fire hazard, and would require frequent ventilation of the chamber to keep the partial pressure within acceptable limits Frequent ventilation is noisy and expensive, but can be used in an emergency. It is also necessary that the BIBS gas is not contaminated by chamber gas, as this could adversely affect decompression. When this format of BIBS is fitted it can also be used for emergency breathing gas supply in the event of contaminated chamber atmosphere, though in those cases the contamination by exhaled BIBS gas would usually not be important. =Locally vented BIBS= When contamination of the internal atmosphere is not important, and where the external ambient pressure is higher than in the occupied space, exhaled gas is simply dumped into the internal volume, requiring no special flow control beyond a simple non-return valve. The delivery and exhaust mechanism of a BIBS demand valve for this application is the same as for a scuba or SCBA second stage regulator, and these can be used for this purpose with little or no modification.  Applications  = Hyperbaric oxygen therapy = The traditional type of hyperbaric chamber used for therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a rigid shelled pressure vessel. Such chambers can be run at absolute pressures typically about , or more in special cases. Navies, professional diving organizations, hospitals, and dedicated recompression facilities typically operate these. They range in size from semi-portable, one-patient units to room-sized units that can treat eight or more patients. They may be rated for lower pressures if not primarily intended for treatment of diving injuries. A recompression chamber for a single diving casualty In the larger multiplace chambers, patients inside the chamber breathe from either \\"oxygen hoods\\" ‚Äì flexible, transparent soft plastic hoods with a seal around the neck similar to a space suit helmet ‚Äì or tightly fitting oxygen masks, which supply pure oxygen and may be designed to directly exhaust the exhaled gas from the chamber. During treatment patients breathe 100% oxygen most of the time to maximise the effectiveness of their treatment, but have periodic \\"air breaks\\" during which they breathe chamber air (21% oxygen) to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. The exhaled treatment gas must be removed from the chamber to prevent the buildup of oxygen, which could present a fire risk. Attendants may also breathe oxygen some of the time to reduce their risk of decompression sickness when they leave the chamber. The pressure inside the chamber is increased by opening valves allowing high- pressure air to enter from storage cylinders, which are filled by an air compressor. Chamber air oxygen content is kept between 19% and 23% to control fire risk (US Navy maximum 25%). If the chamber does not have a scrubber system to remove carbon dioxide from the chamber gas, the chamber must be isobarically ventilated to keep the CO2 within acceptable limits. = Therapeutic recompression = Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was developed as a treatment for diving disorders involving bubbles of gas in the tissues, such as decompression sickness and gas embolism, and it is still considered the definitive treatment for these conditions. The recompression treats decompression sickness and gas embolism by increasing pressure, which reduces the size of the gas bubbles and improves the transport of blood to downstream tissues. Elimination of the inert component of the breathing gas by breathing oxygen provides a stronger concentration gradient to eliminate dissolved inert gas still in the tissues, and further accelerates bubble reduction by dissolving the gas back into the blood. After elimination of bubbles, the pressure is gradually reduced back to atmospheric levels. The raised oxygen partial pressures in the blood may also help recovery of oxygen-starved tissues downstream of the blockages. Emergency treatment for decompression illness follows schedules laid out in treatment tables. Most treatments recompress to absolute, the equivalent of of water, for 4.5 to 5.5 hours with the casualty breathing pure oxygen, but taking periodic air breaks to reduce oxygen toxicity. For serious cases resulting from very deep dives, the treatment may require a chamber capable of a maximum pressure of , the equivalent of of water, and the ability to supply heliox and nitrox as a breathing gas. = Surface decompression = Divers breathing oxygen in the chamber after a dive Surface decompression is a procedure in which some or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay. A typical surface decompression procedure is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. If there is no in-water 40 ft stop required the diver is surfaced directly. Otherwise, all required decompression up to and including the 40 ft (12 m) stop is completed in-water. The diver is then surfaced and pressurised in a chamber to 50 fsw (15 msw) within 5 minutes of leaving 40 ft depth in the water. If this \\"surface interval\\" from 40 ft in the water to 50 fsw in the chamber exceeds 5 minutes, a penalty is incurred, as this indicates a higher risk of DCS symptoms developing, so longer decompression is required. In the case where the diver is successfully recompressed within the nominal interval, he will be decompressed according to the schedule in the air decompression tables for surface decompression, preferably on oxygen, which is used from 50 fsw (15 msw), a partial pressure of 2.5 bar. The duration of the 50 fsw stop is 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40 fsw (12 msw) for the next stage of up to 4 periods of 30 minutes each on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30 fsw (9 msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken at the end of each 30 minutes of oxygen breathing. = Saturation systems emergency gas supply = During decompression from saturation, a pressure will be reached where raising the oxygen concentration further would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, while keeping it at an acceptable level for fire risk would be inefficient for decompression. BIBS supply of breathing gas with higher oxygen content than the chamber atmosphere can solve this problem. If the atmosphere in a saturation habitat is contaminated, the inhabitants can use the available BIBS masks during the emergency and be supplied with non-contaminated breathing gas until the problem has been solved. = Submarine emergency gas supply = Submarine BIBS systems are intended to provide the crew with diving quality air or nitrox breathing gas in an emergency escape situation where the interior may be partly or completely flooded, and may be at a significantly higher than atmospheric pressure. The supply gas is provided from a high pressure storage bank at a pressure automatically compensated for depth and is distributed around the vessel to points where the breathing units can be connected as required.

They inherited the family fortune in 1994 and formed Ziff Brothers Investments.  Education and personal life  Dirk Edward Ziff was born in 1965, Robert D. Ziff in 1967, and Daniel M. Ziff in 1973. Their father was the Jewish American media magnate William Bernard Ziff Jr. (1930‚Äì2006), who had inherited Ziff Davis from his father William Bernard Ziff Sr. and built the magazine publisher that included titles such as Popular Aviation, PC Magazine, and Car and Driver. Their mother was Barbara Ingrid Beitz, an ethnic German whose parents were awarded the \\"Righteous among the Nations\\" honorific by the State of Israel for providing refuge and risking their lives to save Jews during World War II. Dirk Ziff graduated in 1981 from the Trinity School in New York City, where his father served as trustee. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts from Columbia University and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard. He is married to former Forbes magazine reporter Natasha Bacigalupo. The couple lives in North Palm Beach, Florida and vacations at their Martha's Vineyard home. They have two children. Robert Ziff studied undergraduate electrical and computer engineering at Harvard, graduating magna cum laude. He then attended Cornell Law School, where he graduated first in his class and was editor of the Cornell Law Review. After law school, he clerked for Chief Judge Monroe G. McKay of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Salt Lake City, Utah, and later served as vice president of strategic planning at Ziff Communications Company. He is married to fellow Cornell graduate and attorney Michelle Angelic Locher. They live in Manhattan with their twin sons.

William Ziff Jr. had originally wanted to pass the company on to his sons but they were not interested. Instead, they formed the Ziff Brothers Investments family office in New York City, investing their inheritances broadly across equities, debt, real estate, commodities, private equity and hedge funds. They also provided seed money to fund manager Daniel Och in exchange for a 10% stake in Och-Ziff Capital Management, which went public in 2007. Their investments greatly expanded the brothers' fortune. Forbes estimated their net worth to US$4.8 billion each.

The fighting continued past the ceasefire date and into early February. South Vietnamese forces made greater territorial gains and inflicted significant losses on the North Vietnamese forces. Background At the end of the Easter Offensive in October 1972 both the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) had suffered severe losses and were exhausted. The PAVN had gained permanent control of large areas of the four northernmost provinces ‚Äì Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Th·ª´a Thi√™n, Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng T√≠n ‚Äì and the western fringes of the II and III Corps sectors, totalling around 10% of South Vietnam. The Paris Peace Talks resumed in October 1972 and the outline of the peace agreement was announced on 26 October 1972. One of the sticking points in the negotiations was North Vietnam's insistence that there should be a ceasefire in place, with the PAVN and Vietcong (VC) retaining control of the areas they occupied. South Vietnamese president Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu opposed the continued PAVN occupation, but was coerced by the Nixon Administration to agree to this condition. The final terms of the peace accords were agreed by the parties on 23 January 1973, with signing to take place on 27 January and a country-wide ceasefire in place coming into effect on at 24:00 GMT on 27 January. A joint military commission of South Vietnamese and VC representatives established under the terms of the accords would determine the areas controlled by each side, which was replaced by the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS), composed of representatives from Canada, Indonesia, Hungary and Poland. MACV and South Vietnamese intelligence learned that the PAVN/VC planned general attacks throughout South Vietnam to take place immediately before the expected date of the ceasefire so as to maximize the areas under their control in the expectation that the ICCS monitors would be in place around the country and able to confirm PAVN/VC control and so forestall any South Vietnamese counterattacks. The ARVN prepared for these attacks and planned attacks of its own to regain ground ahead of the ceasefire. The US continued to support the South Vietnamese, principally with air strikes, until the ceasefire came into effect. Battle =I Corps= By late October 1972 the ARVN had recaptured Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and held a line along the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. An attempt to advance to the south bank of the Cam L·ªô/C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River was repulsed in November. On 15 January 1973 the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff began planning began for a final assault by South Vietnamese Marines and ARVN to capture the south bank of the Cam L·ªô/C·ª≠a Vi·ªát River and the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base. The attack was launched on the morning of 26 January and by 07:00 on 28 January the South Vietnamese had recaptured the base. At 08:00 Indochina time on 28 January the ceasefire came into effect and US support for the operation ceased. On the evening of 29 January the PAVN counterattacked and by 31 January had recaptured the base. South Vietnamese losses were 40 killed and they claim to have inflicted over 1000 PAVN casualties. South and west of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã the PAVN B5 Front forces prevented any expansion of the ARVN Airborne Division's positions into the hills south of the Th·∫°ch H√£n River and against the Th·∫°ch H√£n River line itself. The PAVN built up their defenses in the highlands north of the Th·∫°ch H√£n River and west of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Elements of the PAVN 304th Division were shifted to this sector, and additional antiaircraft units were brought into the B5 Front, so that by the end of January elements of at least 11 antiaircraft regiments were deployed in northwestern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province. In late January 1973 elements of the PAVN 263rd SAM Regiment, equipped with SA-2 missiles, deployed to the former Khe Sanh Combat Base. The regiment had four firing battalions, each equipped with four to six launchers and one support battalion. The regiment was apparently deployed to protect the PAVN logistics hub of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the A S·∫ßu Valley and Route 9. Further south in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province, on 24 January elements of the 803rd Regiment, 324B Division moved into the lowlands south of Camp Evans and north of Hu·∫ø. On 25 January artillery and ground attacks began against ARVN positions around Hu·∫ø. Between 27 January and 3 February elements of the 803rd Regiment attempted to interdict Highway 1 in the vicinity of the An Lo bridge. The PAVN captured a number of hamlets before being ejected by ARVN forces, losing over 200 killed. South of Hu·∫ø, the PAVN 5th and 6th Regiments attacked the lowlands around Phu Bai Combat Base, gaining temporary control of several hamlets before being ejected and losing 175 killed. In the PAVN's Military Region 5 which was responsible for Qu·∫£ng Nam, Qu·∫£ng T√≠n and Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Provinces both the PAVN and VC overextended themselves and could not secure their gains. Intelligence sources revealed that the PAVN expected its main forces to be able to contain the ARVN in its bases and thereby permit local forces to invest the hamlets and villages. In Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, Front-4 had completed its preparations for the attacks by 22 January, including having the 575th Artillery Battalion move rockets into four firing positions for attacks against Da Nang. Fighting began on the morning of 26 January with a ground attack against Duc Duc and a rocket attack against Da Nang. Numerous attacks by fire and infantry assault were simultaneously conducted against ARVN positions and lines of communication throughout the province, and all district headquarters in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province were hit. Da Nang received rocket attacks for three consecutive days. The PAVN supported the VC infiltrating the hamlets and villages and VC flags were observed in the hamlets of western Hieu Due District, southern and western ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District, ƒêi·ªán B√†n District, northeastern Duc Duc, western Duy Xuy√™n District and parts of northern Qu·∫ø S∆°n District. Subsequent ARVN operations recovered some of these outlying villages and hamlets; the final result probably correctly reflected the relative military balance and political influence in the area. In Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province the PAVN 711th Division was committed to defending its important base area in the Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c District and played no offensive role. On 27 December the ARVN 3rd Division launched a spoiling attack against the Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c base. Deep penetrations were made in the first few days and the I Corps Commander, Lt. Gen. Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng, sought to exploit the early success by detaching the 51st Infantry Regiment from the 1st Division and on 3 January sent it to reinforce the 3rd Division. On 16 January the 3rd Division commander Maj. Gen. Nguyen Duy Hinh, committed the 51st Regiment to continue the attack to seize the former Firebase West on Hill 1460 () guarding the eastern approach to Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c. The 51st was able to advance only part way up Hill 1460 and could not dislodge the PAVN infantry holding the crest. Meanwhile, elements of the 3rd Division's 2nd Regiment were across the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley and had seized the hill above Chau Son, thus controlling Route 534 into Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c. On 24 January, the 3rd Division's attack continued, the objective was the former Firebase O'Connor () on high ground just east of Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c. On 26 January, with the ceasefire imminent and VC forces moving into the populated lowlands of Qu·∫£ng Nam, the 3rd Division had to terminate its attack. A strong counterattack by the 711th Division forces still on Firebase West prevented the 3d Division's infantry from gaining Firebase O'Connor, but the heavy casualties sustained by the 71lth demoralized and weakened it severely. By the end of January, 3rd Division troops were busy clearing VC forces from the hamlets west and southwest of Da Nang, and by the end of the month only one hamlet remained under PAVN/VC influence in ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District. In Qu·∫£ng Ngai Province between 23 and 26 January VC forces infiltrated into assembly areas in the lowlands and on 27 January attacked throughout the lowlands, rocketing the provincial and district capitals, interdicting Highway 1 and overrunning several Regional Force and Popular Force outposts. In southern Qu·∫£ng Ngai, the PAVN 52nd Regiment, 2nd Division, established defenses around the district town of Ba T∆°, which it had controlled since the fall of 1972. Rather than challenge this position, the ARVN deployed to prevent the 52nd Regiment from moving toward the lowlands. Holding its 1st Regiment in reserve, the PAVN 2nd Division used one battalion to support VC forces in M·ªô ƒê·ª©c District, kept one battalion in the base area, and deployed the third to support the attack of the 141st Regiment in Duc Tho District. On 27 January the 141st Regiment, supported by two battalions of the PAVN 12th Regiment, 3rd Division reached Highway 1 south of Duc Tho and secured the rest of the district south to the border of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, including Sa Hu·ª≥nh Base, in which two battalions of the PAVN 12th Regiment, 3rd Division, supported the attack of the 2nd Division. Since the PAVN had blocked the only north - south line of communication and had secured a seaport, however small and undeveloped, in the center of the country, the South Vietnamese could hardly permit this situation to go unchallenged. Vigorous counterattacks succeeded in driving the PAVN from Sa Hu·ª≥nh by 16 February. PAVN losses were estimated to be in excess of 600 killed. Despite having seized Sa Hu·ª≥nh only the day before the ceasefire, the PAVN were outraged at being ejected from lands they \\"legitimately\\" occupied at the moment of ceasefire. =II Corps= The southern part of PAVN Military Region 5 included B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, Ph√∫ Y√™n and Kh√°nh H√≤a Provinces. South Vietnamese intelligence determined that the PAVN's objectives were to isolate the northern districts of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, hold the ARVN 22nd Division in its bases, cut Highway 1 and gain control of as much land and as many people as possible. From the PAVN viewpoint the prospects for success seemed good, for large segments of the population in the coastal areas of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh and Ph√∫ Y√™n had long been sympathetic to the VC, and the ARVN 22nd Division had yet to establish any reputation for excellence in battle. Since the area along Highway 1 was fairly densely populated, it would provide a significant population base. Fighting started in northeast B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh on 23 January 1973, when elements of the PAVN 12th Regiment, 3rd Division, moved from bases in the An L√£o valley toward the Tam Quan lowlands. Beginning on the 24th and lasting until the 28th, the attacks were designed to fix the ARVN 41st Regiment in its bases and support the attack of the PAVN 2nd Division just to the north at Sa Huynh. South of the Lai Giang River, in Ho√†i √Çn District, the rest of the PAVN 3rd Division attacked government outposts and attempted to prevent the deployment of the 22nd Division. On 28 January, the VC began their attacks along Highway 1 and in the hamlets and villages, successfully cutting the highway just south of the B·ªìng S∆°n pass and in several places in Ph√∫ Y√™n Province. Farther south, in Kh√°nh H√≤a, other attempts to cut Highway 1 were unsuccessful. Although contacts were light and scattered in Kh√°nh H√≤a Province, the PAVN/VC succeeded in interdicting Highway 21, temporarily isolating Ban Me Thuot from the coast. By 28 January, a number of hamlets in Ph√∫ Y√™n were under PAVN/VC control, but hard fighting by RF and PF succeeded by 2 February in eliminating PAVN/VC control in all but two hamlets. By the 5th all of Highway 1 was back under government control, although the route remained closed to traffic until all destroyed bridges were repaired. Although the PAVN/VC seemed to enjoy great chances for success in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh and Ph√∫ Y√™n Provinces, it was clear by the first week of February that they had failed to achieve any significant gains and the PAVN/VC forces had incurred extremely heavy losses. The PAVN's B3 Front included Kontum, Pleiku, Phu Bon and Darlac Provinces, part of Quang Duc Province and western districts of B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. Objectives assigned to PAVN/VC forces in B3 Front were similar to those in southern MR 5: to hold the ARVN 23rd Division in place, isolate the cities of Kontum, Pleiku, and Ban Me Thuot and interdict the main highways. Attaining these objectives would effectively extend control over the population of the Central Highlands. The PAVN/VC waited until the night of 26 January to make their moves into the hamlets and villages, and not until the morning of the ceasefire did the attacks reach full intensity. The timing meant that the ARVN would have to conduct its counterattacks after the ceasefire and so in theory would be subject to ICCS observation and control. Preparations for occupying the villages and hamlets in the highlands began on 20 and 21 January when elements of both PAVN divisions, the 10th and 320th, began attacks to tie down ARVN defenders. On 20 January the 320th Division attacked ƒê·ª©c C∆° Camp and by the next day controlled the camp. On 27 January the 24th and 28th Regiments, 10th Division attacked Polei Krong and Trung Nghia, forcing the ARVN 85th Ranger Border Defense Battalion to withdraw from Polei Krong on the 28th. On 26 January, in coordination with the Polei Krong and Trung Nghia attack, the 95B Regiment, 10th Division, seized Highway 14 where it traversed the Chu Pao Pass and held on until 10 February. Farther south, in Darlac Province, a bridge on Highway 14 near Bu√¥n H·ªì was destroyed and several hamlets infiltrated. Contact with Ban Me Thuot by way of Highway 14 was interrupted until about 14 February. The VC Gia Lai Provincial Unit closed Highway 19 at the Pleiku-B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh border and maintained the block until 4 February. South of Pleiku City, elements of the 320th Division were successful in closing Highway 14 temporarily. Pleiku City itself received repeated attacks by 122mm rockets on 28 January, but damage was light. The PAVN/VC failed to hold the occupied villages and sustained heavy losses and their military effectiveness decreased significantly. The most important gain was the recapture of ƒê·ª©c C∆° in time to receive the ICCS, this achievement aside, by mid-February the military balance in the highlands was generally the same as it had been at the end of December 1972. PAVN Military Region 6 included five South Vietnamese provinces, the mountain provinces of Tuyen Duc and L√¢m ƒê·ªìng and the coastal provinces of Ninh Thu·∫≠n, B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n and B√¨nh Tuy. This was a sparsely populated region and relatively isolated from the war. The ARVN had no regular forces deployed there and the RF and PF maintained effective control. The PAVN/VC in MR 6 had only four PAVN infantry battalions, one PAVN artillery battalion, and two VC infantry battalions, all of them weak and understrength. Action began on the night of 26 January with an attack on a hamlet north of Da Lat, the capital of Tuyen Duc. Another PAVN/VC force attempted unsuccessfully to enter a hamlet north of Phan Thi·∫øt in B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n. Although local forces interdicted Highway 20 east of Bao Lac in L√¢m ƒê·ªìng Province, South Vietnamese forces cleared the route by 30 January. Another thrust was repulsed with heavy losses at T√°nh Linh District town in B√¨nh Tuy on 27 January. On the morning of the 28th, the day the ceasefire was to become effective, the number of hamlets entered increased significantly, especially in B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, but a PAVN battalion entering a suburb of Da Lat was quickly ejected. The RF and PF performed capably, and by the end of January the situation was clearly under South Vietnamese control. Highway 1 through the coastal provinces was never successfully cut, and the only lasting result of the campaign was the serious depletion of the PAVN/VC's local force battalions. =III Corps= The PAVN's Eastern Nam Bo Region was roughly the same as South Vietnam's III Corps (B√¨nh Tuy, Gia ƒê·ªãnh, H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a and Long An Provinces were excluded). In addition to scheduling attacks close to the ceasefire date, the PAVN in October 1972 had also learned that it lacked the strength to infiltrate the Saigon area with main forces. Operations in Eastern Nam Bo did not begin until a few days before the ceasefire was to become effective and Saigon was not an objective. As in other populated areas of South Vietnam, the PAVN's objective just before ceasefire was to extend the area under PAVN/VC control and gather more people, but in the Eastern Nam Bo region a second objective applied: to establish a suitable capital for the VC in South Vietnam. Intelligence collected in the weeks before ceasefire appeared to indicate that T√¢y Ninh, the capital of T√¢y Ninh Province had been selected; but for reasons not fully clear, the PAVN failed to allocate sufficient forces to capture the city. ARVN preemptive operations in January 1973 most likely eliminated the PAVN's capability to assign main forces to a T√¢y Ninh campaign. As a result, only relatively weak, local forces were available and the campaign failed. At the end of the first two weeks in January, ARVN III Corps began an attack into the Saigon River corridor and advanced all the way to Tri Tam in the Michelin Rubber Plantation. PAVN/VC losses were estimated in excess of 400 killed. The damage and disruption caused in enemy bases in the Long Nguyen Secret Zone and the Boi Loi Woods were extensive. Heavily supported by B-52s, the ARVN disrupted the PAVN's plans for pre-ceasefire operations. The PAVN 7th Division was forced to deploy in the Michelin plantation and the ARVN contained it there during this critical time. The Michelin operation also forced the PAVN to keep major elements of the 9th Division in defensive positions around An L·ªôc and L·ªôc Ninh in B√¨nh Long Province. Intelligence reports had indicated that the 9th was to play an important role in the T√¢y Ninh attacks. The number and intensity of attacks by fire significantly increased from 23 through 25 January. Widespread attacks by fire and assault began on the 26th and 27th against ARVN and RF/PF outposts, mostly on those located in defense of major lines of communication. Among those hit were Tr·∫£ng B√†ng on Highway 1, the vicinity of Tr·∫£ng Bom in Bi√™n H√≤a Province, the junction of Highways 1 and 20 in Long Kh√°nh Province, Highway 13 south of Ch∆°n Th√†nh and north of L√°i Thi√™u in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, Highway 15 south of Long Th√†nh and north of Phuoc Le and Highway 23 in southern Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province near ƒê·∫•t ƒê·ªè. PAVN/VC casualties were fairly heavy, especially along Highway 13 south of Ch∆°n Th√†nh, where the PAVN/VC lost over 120 killed. The PAVN/VC attained some short-term successes, about 144 hamlets were reported contested at one lime or another during the period 23‚Äì29 January 1973. Nevertheless, by 3 February only 14 hamlets remained under PAVN/VC control, and four days later all hamlets in the region were back under control of South Vietnamese forces. The line-of-communication interdictions were also short lived; all major roads were open by 1 February. In keeping with the PAVN goal of political control, terrorist attacks during the brief campaign were few, apparently on the theory that widespread terrorism would antagonize the people. As it was, in most instances the people would leave their hamlets as the PAVN/VC forces entered and return only when South Vietnamese forces had ejected the PAVN/VC. The PAVN's political objectives were not achieved, the attempt to seize T√¢y Ninh never approached success, and RF/PF forces were able to clear the PAVN/VC from out lying hamlets with only minimal assistance from the ARVN. The cost of the campaign for the PAVN/VC was heavy; over 2,000 PAVN/VC troops were killed and 41 captured. A large proportion of the casualties occurred in VC forces; they were weak at the beginning and weaker still at the end. =IV Corps= On 15 January the ARVN and RF/PF forces launched Operation Dong Khoi, a six-day operation throughout the Mekong Delta, early successes led to the operation being extended for six more days. PAVN/VC losses of over 2,000 killed and disruptions in deployment and logistical activity seriously affected the PAVN's ability to launch a significant offensive. The areas the PAVN planned to capture in the Delta were those having the greatest potential for subsequent exploitation and expansion. In the northern Delta, they considered the border area with Cambodia from H√† Ti√™n in the west to the Parrot's Beak in the east to be most important, including northern Ki√™n Giang, Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, Kien Phong, Ki·∫øn T∆∞·ªùng and Long An Provinces. Western H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Province also had high priority as did central ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province. Highway 4 from the southwestern Delta to Saigon crossed the center of ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng, and the area around M·ªπ Tho, the capital, was densely populated. The PAVN also wanted to extend their control in Ch∆∞∆°ng Thi·ªán Province. Having already established control in the U Minh Forest, they could anchor the terminus of an infiltration corridor from Cambodia through Ki√™n Giang into the lower Delta, but because of Operation Dong Khoi none of these goals would be realized. PAVN Military Region 2 included eight of the Delta provinces; in the north, Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, which contained the PAVN base in the Seven Mountains on the Cambodian border; to the east, Kien Phong and Ki·∫øn T∆∞·ªùng, with the vast marshy area of the Plain of Reeds; to the south of these three border provinces, the central Mekong provinces of An Giang and Sa ƒê√©c, whose dense populations were under relatively strong South Vietnamese influence and control, and the vital, populous province of ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng and in the far south, the coastal provinces of Kien Hoa and G√≤ C√¥ng. PAVN operations began on 23 January when two battalions of the PAVN 207th Regiment crossed the Cambodian border into northern Kien Phong Province. This invasion coincided with at least 13 light attacks by fire and ground probes. Two PAVN soldiers captured that day revealed that the PAVN's intention was to capture the district town of H·ªìng Ng·ª±, destroy all government posts along the border, intercept South Vietnamese relief columns, and then extend the attack southward deep into Kien Phong Province. Attacks were recorded along the entire border. In one of many sharp engagements northeast of Cai Cai Camp, South Vietnamese casualties were light but the PAVN lost 32 killed and 2 captured. In heavy fighting on the 25th, the ARVN again incurred light casualties but killed 47 PAVN. PAVN losses in less than three days exceeded 100 killed in exchange for only minor ground advances. Following this flurry of attacks, the fighting in Kien Phong Province abated and remained so until the eve of the ceasefire. South Vietnamese bases were subjected only to sporadic light attacks by fire. In ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng Province, despite a heavy concentration of PAVN main force units in the center of the province (the 5th and 6th Divisions, the E1, 6th, DT1 and 320th Regiments, and possibly elements of the 174th Regiment), the level of activity was surprisingly low. Even on 28 and 29 January, when the number of attacks approximately doubled, the weight of the attacks remained low. Although ground contact was made with elements of the 174th Regiment in the area known as Tri Phap, these contacts subsided after the ceasefire, probably attributable to high PAVN casualties. In eastern ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng and G√≤ C√¥ng Provinces a prisoner reported that main forces, including the PAVN 88th and 24th Regiments, were to break down into small units and conduct political activity among the population. This tactic was to create the impression that the local forces were everywhere throughout the Delta and would support PAVN political activity. The troops had instructions to limit the use of heavy weapons and thus gain more credibility as local guerrillas. Local South Vietnamese forces responded effectively to this campaign and the PAVN achieved no significant gains. The PAVN's Military Region 3 included the nine provinces of the lower Delta. Ki√™n Giang, on the Cambodian border. was the northernmost. The Delta capital and the headquarters for the ARVN IV Corps was at C·∫ßn Th∆° in the central Mekong province of Phong Dinh. The PAVN's only relatively secure and uncontested base area in the Delta was in MR 3, the U Minh Forest, a vast mangrove swamp and forest extending across the border of Ki√™n Giang and An Xuy√™n Provinces on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. As elsewhere in the Delta, activity in MR 3 increased sharply on 23 January. Well over half of the incidents reported were harassments and attacks by fire against South Vietnamese posts. In the northwest, the PAVN 1st Division sent troops across the frontier from Cambodia with the apparent purpose of having them in position for the kickoff of operations at the time of the ceasefire. Documents captured in sharp fighting near H√† Ti√™n in northwestern Ki√™n Giang were identified as belonging to a battalion of the 52nd Regiment, 1st Division and subsequent interrogation of a captured prisoner confirmed the battalion's presence as well as those of the regimental headquarters and a second battalion. The prisoner described the regiment's low morale; many of the soldiers had recently been released from military hospitals. and the general health or the unit was low. The regiment's mission was to occupy the H√† Ti√™n area and show the VC flag prior to the ceasefire. Combined operations employing the Republic of Vietnam Air Force and the Rangers pushed the 52nd back into Cambodia. Air strikes killed more than 70 soldiers of the 52nd and ground fighting accounted for at least 15 more. The PAVN's 44th Sapper Regiment, also subordinate to the 1st Division, began operations in the Seven Mountains of Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc on 15 January with attacks by fire against South Vietnamese posts. The 44th moved into the Seven Mountains near Tri T√¥n on 23 January to occupy as much territory and gain control of as much population as possible, but ARVN counter-operations again prevented any significant successes. The third element of the PAVN 1st Division, the 101D Regiment, apparently remained in its base in the Seven Mountains and contributed only with attacks by fire. The highest level of PAVN activity in MR 3 occurred in Ch∆∞∆°ng Thi·ªán Province. Four PAVN regiments were available to converge on the province capital, V·ªã Thanh. The PAVN 18B Regiment was to the northwest, the 95A Sapper Regiment was south along with elements of the D2 Regiment and part of the D1 Regiment was in eastern Ch∆∞∆°ng Thi·ªán near the Phong Dinh Province border. The PAVN headquarters for MR 3 was in the center of the province. The number and intensity or attacks increased sharply on 26 January, including a series of mortar and rocket attacks, some with 120mm mortars, southwest of Y Tang. The activity increased again on 27 January and a number of outposts and district towns experienced ground attacks and attacks by fire. Contingents of the D2 Regiment penetrated the district town of Long M·ªπ as far as the marketplace before they could be driven out. On the same day Kien Thien received a heavy bombardment followed by a ground attack by elements of the 95A Sapper Regiment, this attack was also repelled. At Kien Hung, through the nights or 27 and 28 January the 18B Regiment conducted attacks by fire. By the morning of 28 January the town was surrounded by PAVN troops, but South Vietnamese forces successfully held. The province capital, V·ªã Thanh, received sporadic attacks by fire, but casualties and damage were light. Attacks were widespread to the far south, primarily against RF/PF outposts and district towns, but in no case did the situation change markedly from that before the campaign got under way. The activity appeared to crest by midday on 28 January, and a general uneasy quiet followed. During the campaign at least 125 hamlets came under PAVN attack, but no more than 20 were ever being contested at anyone time. No main lines of communication were ever threatened and all major roads and canals remained open to traffic. Assassinations and other terrorism lagged. Nowhere in the Mekong Delta did the PAVN make any significant or lasting gain. In the face of the highly successful Operation Dong Khoi, the PAVN apparently realized that major territorial acquisitions were impossible. Aftermath The operations of late January and early February 1973 followed the patterns established in October 1972 when a ceasefire had appeared imminent, except that the PAVN waited until much closer to the date of the ceasefire to start the campaign. Otherwise, the objectives and techniques were substantially the same: main force units generally defended the territory already under control and attacked to fix ARVN regulars in their bases, while local PAVN/VC units entered the hamlets. Throughout South Vietnam, the campaign between 28 January and 9 February cost the PAVN/VC over 5,000 killed in exchange for little alteration in the situation that existed in mid-January. By 9 February, only 23 of more than 400 hamlets attacked were still reported as contested. U.S. observers at MACV in Saigon attributed the PAVN's failures to tactical errors, the limited capabilities of the local forces and an outstanding performance by the South Vietnamese. The PAVN had erred in delaying pre-ceasefire operations in the expectation that the South Vietnamese would be deterred in counterattacking by the presence of ICCS observers. The PAVN committed their other important strategic mistake by breaking down the local forces into small units and attacking at so many places. thereby reducing the staying capacity of any local unit. The ARVN and local RF and PF were able to react deliberately against these hamlet challenges and to eliminate them one by one. The PAVN's local forces were decimated and never recovered. South Vietnamese forces had clearly learned much of the PAVN's strategy and objectives from October 1972 and had planned accordingly. The campaign demonstrated that South Vietnam's armed forces could probably hold their own against the force the North had at that time on the southern battlefields, and that the military balance in South Vietnam was close to even.

The initiative has received support from major opposition parties. The aim of the initiative has been to pressure the Awami League government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to hold a free and fair election in December 2018 with the participation of all major political parties. The previous general election in Bangladesh, held in 2014, was boycotted by major opposition parties and was not deemed credible by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United Nations. Background Bangladesh's constitution, enacted in 1972 under the leadership of Kamal Hossain, initially established a secular multi-party parliamentary democracy. In 1975, the country abolished parliamentary democracy and endured six months of one party rule. A military coup in August 1975 assassinated founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and ushered a period of martial law. A multiparty parliament was elected in 1979 under an autocratic President, Ziaur Rahman. A second military coup in 1982 overthrew President Abdus Sattar and ushered martial law for four years until 1986. A multiparty parliament was elected in 1986 under an autocratic president, Hussain Muhammad Ershad. In 1991, following a mass uprising, Ershad resigned and parliamentary democracy was reinstated. Since the restoration of parliamentary democracy, Bangladesh was ruled by the Khaleda Zia-led BNP between 1991 and 1996 and 2001 to 2006; and the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League between 1996 and 2001 and again since 2009. Until 2008, elections were managed by a neutral caretaker government. The last caretaker regime was installed by the military in 2007 and ruled for two years until the 2008 election. The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina scrapped the caretaker system in 2011. The scrapping was condemned by most opposition parties, which felt a free and fair election cannot be held under Hasina's government. The rivalry between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina has also affected Bangladeshi politics and often resulted in violence. Both Hasina and Zia have been criticized for their governments' alleged corruption and human rights record. Kamal Hossain, a longstanding supporter of reform, has advocated a national unity government to make Bangladesh a \\"functional democracy\\". In 2008, he teamed up with several center-right and left-wing parties to make a push for a national unity. While announcing his initiative, Hossain said \\"The people are the real owners of the country and a fair election is must to establish that. An effective democracy must be established ahead of the 50th anniversary of independence. A process of greater national unity is officially launching activities from today to ensure that only the real representatives of the people can rule the country\\". On 22 September 2018, Hossain stated that \\"Bangabandhu had given me the responsibility to formulate the constitution of a newly liberated country. That has been my best achievement. Personally, I have nothing else to get. As a political activist, it is my sacred duty to ensure the empowerment of the people as per the constitution\\".

He is Deputy CEO of civil rights group AfriForum and the CEO of the film production company Forum Films.  Education  Roets grew up in the agricultural town of Tzaneen where he matriculated in 2003 from the Merensky High School. He obtained his LLB degree in 2009 from the University of Pretoria (UP). During his student years he served in various leadership structures, including the Student Representative Council (SRC) and the Senate, at this university. During his student years Roets served as founding member and the first National Chairperson of Solidarity Youth. In 2008 Solidarity Youth changed its name and the organisation was converted to AfriForum Youth. In 2016, Roets obtained his LLM degree in Public Law with distinction from the UP. The title of his dissertation was ‚Äôn Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe.  Career  Roets was arrested in 2010 after he attempted to install a billboard with the words ‚ÄúWelcome to Pretoria‚Äù next to the N1 highway. This action was in protest against the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality‚Äôs use of the word ‚ÄúTshwane‚Äù to refer to the capital during the 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup. In 2011 Roets was appointed as Deputy CEO of AfriForum. He testified on behalf of AfriForum in 2011 in the case of AfriForum vs. Malema. On behalf of AfriForum he submitted a charge of hate speech against Julius Malema after Malema sang the song ‚ÄúDubula I‚ÄôBhunu‚Äù (Shoot the Boer) at various political gatherings. The court found Malema guilty of hate speech. In May 2018, following criticism of Afriforum by a North-West University professor, Elmien du Plessis, Roets posted a YouTube video where he quoted Victor Klemperer, stating that \\"if the tables were turned after the Holocaust he 'would have all the intellectuals strung up, and the professors three feet higher than the rest; they would be left hanging from the lamp posts for as long as was compatible with hygiene.'\\" Following the video posting, du Plessis and her family received threats of violence. A petition condemning the threats against academics was subsequently circulated.  Personal life  He is the son of Sarel Arnoldus and Irma Mariette (N√©e Ernst) of Orania. Roets married Lelanie (N√©e de Kock) on 5 December 2009 and has four children. He is also part of a heavy metal band called \\"Soms Wen Die Wolf\\".  Films and publications  = Tainted Heroes = Tainted Heroes is a South African documentary film that was produced by Forum Films under direction of Elrich Yssel, with Roets and Beatrice Pretorius as producers. The film is about the violent battle of the African National Congress (ANC) against apartheid in South Africa between 1976 and 1994. The documentary is based on the book People‚Äôs War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa by Anthea Jeffery. A spokesperson for the ANC said \\"This is nothing else but propaganda. ‚ÄúThey should be doing a film about how many of them in AfriForum have collaborated with apartheid. They are nothing else but hardcore racists. They are a group like the Ku Klux Klan (American white supremacist group).‚Äù.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. History In 1858, the partnership of Meigs, Stone and Witherbee opened the Exchange Bank in Flint, with Austin B. Witherbee acting as a local representative, with two out-of-town partners. In 1864, Witherbee bought out his partners, and in 1865 reorganized it as the First National Bank; this became the First National Bank of Flint in 1905. In 1916, the bank consolidated some business aspects with the Genesee County Savings Bank. Due to Flint's booming economy, both banks were outgrowing their headquarters, and in 1919, First National purchased a lot on which to build. In 1923, they hired the local architectural firm of J.W. Cook to design a new building, and began construction. The building was completed in 1924. The new building housed not only the bank, but the rental space on the upper floors was designed to house doctors and dentists. Over the rest of the 1920s, the bank grew tremendously, and in 1929 fully merged with the Genesee County Savings Bank, renaming itself the First National Bank and Trust Company. The merger created a need for new space, and the bank built an addition to their headquarters, nearly doubling the space. Also designed by J.W. Cook, the annex was completed in 1930. However, the 1930s also brought the Great Depression, and in 1933 the bank merged with the Union Industrial Savings Bank in order to remain open. However, both banks soon entered receivership. Liquidation of the First National Bank and Trust Company's assets began in 1934, and was not completed until 1940. The bank building was purchased by William Ballenger, a former board member, in 1940. A woman's clothing store opened in the former banking space, with professional offices still occupying the upper floors. In 1966, the First Federal Savings and Loan Association purchased the building from the Ballenger Trust. In 2004, the Uptown Reinvestment Corporation received the building, and began restoration and rehabilitation, creating apartments upstairs and a bank space on the street level. As of 2018, the building houses lofts and is known as the First Street Lofts. Description First Street Lofts is a rectangular, seven-story Classical Revival building, clad in white terra cotta. The building is located on a corner lot, and has a decorative entrance on each primary facade. The lower levels have been reconstructed to look like the original construction, after destructive renovation in the twentieth century. The facade facing Saginaw has an elaborate, deeply recessed central entryway topped with an arched window and a carved eagle sculpture. The entry is flanked by massive fluted Ionic piers, small windows, and Doric piers at the corners. The second floor line is topped with a terra cotta architrave, frieze, and cornice line, which continues around the corner. The side contains less decorative arch-topped windows on the lower level. The upper stories, three to seven, contain repetitive recessed window openings. An ornate cornice tops the seventh story, with a penthouse at the very top.

Dubbed Thailand's version of the British graffiti artist Banksy, Headache Stencil is known for his satirical graffiti art depicting the military officials of Thailand who took power in 2014. He says of himself, \\"I started calling myself Headache Stencil because I knew what I did is going to cause people headaches. I've been a troublemaker since I was a kid,...\\" Career Headache's works first appeared on the streets of Bangkok and Chiang Mai in 2014. He became more widely known in January 2018 with his graffiti of the Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan's face inside an alarm clock, a jab at the lack of financial transparency by the generals, who was struggling to explain his collection of undeclared luxury watches. In March 2018, he was in the spotlight for his graffiti of a black panther crying tears of blood, a reference to the case of a Thai construction magnate who was later charged with poaching one of the protected cats during an illegal safari hunt in a national park. In September 2018, he depicted Thai junta chief Prayut Chan-o- cha as \\"a lucky cat\\" with a paw raised to rake in money. To commemorate the 88th anniversary of the 1932 Siamese Revolution, on 24 June 2020, Headache Stencil and some fellow activists projected images of 1932 revolt leader Pridi Banomyong onto a wall of Wat Ratchanadda. Also shown was the proclamation that announced the end of absolute monarchy. Thai authorities now regard the commemoration of the democratic revolt to be a crime. Controversy On 26 January 2020, Headache Stencil came under controversy for his statements on Twitter targeting Chinese people, which read \\"Hey Chink! Please go back to ur shit-eating country. Our government need ur money to keep their power but you all not welcome for us now. #notwelcometothailand #backtourchinklandpls\\". This incident was covered by both domestic and foreign press as an example of COVID-19 related sinophobia.

Their marital break-up caused a sensation and their divorce, in 1670, on the grounds of Lady Roos's adultery, was the first to be granted in England since the Reformation. Anne was the daughter of Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester, and Cecilia Bayning, and was thus distantly related to Manners (whose grandmother was a Pierrepont), then known as Lord Roos and heir to the earldom of Rutland, whom she married on 15 July 1658.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Page 3448 Their first child was a daughter, who died in early infancy. When Lady Roos went on a trip to London and came back pregnant, she is alleged to have told her husband that, regardless of who had fathered the child, if it was a boy it would one day be Earl of Rutland. The boy, when he was born, was named \\"Ignoto\\" at his baptism and sent to a foster home by Lord Roos. Lord Roos obtained a \\"separation from bed and board\\" from his wife in the ecclesiastical courts in 1666 and introduced a bill into the House of Lords to pronounce her children illegitimate, on grounds of her adultery. A private Act of Parliament in 1667 illegitimised any children she had had since 1659 and in 1670 another Act gave him permission to remarry. Although an MP, Roos had taken little interest in Parliamentary proceedings until he began to seek support for his divorce. At some time following the divorce, Lady Roos began using the title Lady Anne Vaughan. King Charles II of England was a regular attendee in the House of Lords, and a rumour arose that the King intended to use the divorce as a precedent for divorcing his own queen, Catherine of Braganza, who had borne no surviving children. Anne's father unsuccessfully challenged his son- in-law, Roos, to a duel. Anne herself had Ignoto returned to her and renamed him. She then had another son by an anonymous father, and the two boys were known as John and Charles Manners. She is believed to have married someone with the surname Vaughan, possibly the same man who was injured in a duel with Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke, in the 1670s. Roos married Lady Diana Bruce in 1671, and went on to have legitimate children by his third wife, Catherine Wriothesley Noel.

The church's campus is located at the intersection of Sichel and Altura streets in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood. In 2005 it was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. The congregation was founded in 1887. The original church was designed in the Romanesque Revival style by English architect Ernest Coxhead. In 1913 that building was converted to the parish hall and Arthur Benton was commissioned to design a new church sanctuary. Benton's structure incorporated Gothic Revival and Mission Revival in addition to Romanesque Revival. The pipe organ was designed by Henry Pilcher's Sons of Louisville, Kentucky. In 1968, the church served as a planning base for the East L.A. Chicano student walkouts and the Chicano Moratorium anti-Vietnam War protest. Cesar Chavez gave speeches in the parish hall and La Raza, an underground pro-Chicano newspaper, was printed in the church basement. The non-profit Epiphany Conservation Trust was founded in 2010 to raise funds to restore the church. Restoration is being directed by the Los Angeles firm of Escher GuneWardena Architecture. Repairs began in 2011 and to date have covered structural work on the parish hall and restoration of four stained glass windows.
