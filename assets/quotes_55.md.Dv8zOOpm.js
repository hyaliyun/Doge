Wings are transparent with apical black spots on the fore-wings. The abdomen is black with large yellow spots on lateral sides on segments 2 to 7. Segments 2 to 5 have broad mid-dorsal black stripes which is absent in Libellago lineata. These abdominal markings will help to easily distinguish it from Libellago lineata.

Awards Hull received the National Institute's Women of Color Award for her contribution to this book. Her contribution to this \\"landmark scholarship directed attention to the lives of Black women and, combined with the numerous articles she wrote thereafter, helped remedy the emphasis within Feminist Studies on white women and within Black studies on Black men\\".. Context The interest in black feminism was on the rise in the 1970s, through the writings of Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others. In 1981, the anthology This Bridge Called My Back, edited by Cherr√≠e Moraga and Gloria E. Anzald√∫a, was published and But Some of Us Are Brave was published the following year. In both anthologies, the emphasis was placed on the intersection between race and gender. The contributors argued that previous waves of feminism had focused on issues related to white women. They wanted to negotiate a large space for women of color. According to Teresa de Lauretis, This Bridge Called My Back and But Some Women Are Brave revealed \\"the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism\\" and created a \\"shift in feminist consciousness.\\"de Lauretis, Teresa, \\"The Technology of Gender\\" in Impact In the 2000 reprint of their anthology, editors Hull, Bell-Scott, and Smith described how in 1992 black feminists mobilized \\"a remarkable national response\\" - African American Women in Defense of Ourselves - to the controversy surrounding the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States against the backdrop of allegations by law professor Anita Hill, about sexual harassment that became part of Thomas' confirmation hearings. Legal scholar Kimberl√© Crenshaw cited But Some of Us Are Brave, at the beginning of her seminal 1989 paper, \\"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\\" in which she introduced the concept of Intersectionality. Crenshaw is known for introducing and developing intersectional theory to feminism. Crenshaw noted that it was one of the \\"very few Black women's studies books\\". She used the title All the Women Are White; All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave, as her \\"point of departure\\" to \\"develop a Black feminist criticism\\". Barbara Y. Welke published her article entitled \\"When All the Women Were White, and All the Blacks Were Men: Gender, Class, Race, and the Road to Plessy, 1855‚Äì1914\\", in reference to Hull et al., in 1995 in the Law and History Review. Welke wrote how Crenshaw, referring to Hull But Some of Us Are Brave, said that the title \\"sets forth a problematic consequence of the tendency to treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience and analysis.

The French form the third largest European immigrants in Colombia after the Spanish and Italians. It is estimated that there are 350,000 Colombians of French descent today.  History  During the early 18th century, many French explorers traveled to the Caribbean coast of Colombia, called Urab√°. At around 140 French registered as Protestants who undertook to grow cocoa beans. After a violent conflict between the European explorers and the indigenous, the survivors were able to flee from war and began settling in the department of Cordob√°.

In 1855, a group of French immigrants landed in Colombia that deeply impacted the history of mining in the Antioquia region during the second half of the 19th century. The members who worked in the mining were Count Adolphe de Gaisne de Bourmont, Adolphe and Paul de Bedout, Augustin de Colleville, Henri Br√®che and Eug√®ne Lutz. Bourmont bought in 1856 a part of the shares of the Titirib√≠ smelting farm, which belonged to the English Tyrell Moore, and also of different mines located in the area. The collapse of most French agricultural, industrial or mining companies stand out, including the fruitless attempt by a French geographer Elis√©e Reclus, who installed a crop in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, or the French Sinu Company. Until 1870, nearly all French immigrants to Colombia originated from the Pyrenees.

The plot is about a boy who is sent to a remote boarding school and discovers something sinister occurring there. The film was first released in the US on August 31, 2018. Plot Jacob Rathbone is a 12-year-old boy with a fear of the dark who lives with his stepfather, Davis and his mother, Isabel, who is frustrated with her son‚Äôs frequent night terrors. After being discovered dancing while dressed in his late grandmother‚Äôs dress, Jacob is sent away to a boarding school in the wilderness governed by the eccentric Dr. and Mrs. Sherman. He meets his classmates: social outcasts like a disfigured burn survivor, Phil; Tourette's sufferer, Frederic; autistic Elwood Ramsay; and manipulative Christine Holcomb. Their classes are administered under Dr. Sherman‚Äôs strict regime that consists of a Bible Studies curriculum and corporal punishments. Not long after, Frederic is discovered dead half-naked in the bathroom in apparent suicide by hanging. Christine uses this opportunity to flee the school with Jacob, only to be caught and brought back. Dr. Sherman reveals that Christine was sent there as a result of having murdered her older brother, Timothy, and driving her mother to commit suicide over the tragedy. Christine lures Jacob to her room, where she confesses to talking Frederic into trying out autoerotic asphyxiation and pushing him to death to divert everybody‚Äôs attention so she could escape. She blackmails Jacob into dancing with her, during which she attempts to stab him with a pair of scissors but is overpowered by him. In a display of her masochistic tendencies, she professes her love for him and claims she wanted to provoke Jacob into beating her up. Jacob later finds Elwood dead in bed. An argument between Dr. and Mrs. Sherman ‚Äî whose real identity is Lynn Adams ‚Äî reveals that it was she who had murdered Elwood, and that the children will all die that night. He finds the bodies of the real Dr. and Mrs. Sherman and Frederic stashed in the freezer in the basement. A conversation between Mrs. Ramsay and Dr. Sherman suggests a prior arrangement where, being unable to cope with Elwood‚Äôs condition, Mrs. Ramsay had sent him there to be killed off seemingly in an accident ‚Äî a fate that awaits all the other children. Ms. Adams stabs Mrs. Ramsay to death; Dr. Sherman slits Ms. Adams‚Äô throat and kills the groundskeeper. Dr. Sherman reveals to Jacob that he has been contract killing since he was around Jacob‚Äôs age, and his plan is to have everyone in the house killed in a fire. Jacob also finds out that it was his stepfather, Davis, who had him sent there to rid himself and Isabel of him. Jacob manages to bludgeon Dr. Sherman to death and set him on fire. He evacuates everyone from the house except Christine, whom he leaves for dead as a way of avenging Frederic's death. Having declared his love for Christine, Jacob peels off his dress, showing his true, naked self to his friends for the first time. Now rescued, the children reunite with their parents, as Jacob whispers to Phil's father that he knows of his intention, and promises to make him regret it if anything happens to Phil. Throughout the film, the audience is shown flashbacks where, being forced into hiding during World War II, Jacob's grandmother Feiga, a recluse, sharpened her teeth with a nail file, while her compatriot was frequently raped and tortured by a Nazi soldier in exchange for her life. Back at home, having finally overcome his fear of the dark, Jacob waits as Isabel‚Äôs terrified screams are heard from the dinner table. Davis dies from ingesting poisoned wine. Jacob taints his lips red with blood, mirroring Feiga ripping out the Nazi‚Äôs throat with her fangs; suggesting that just like Feiga, hardships have made him a fighter albeit a monster.

Dennis Harvey of Variety called the film a \\"conceptually muddled mix of quasi-horror\\" and concluded that it is \\"too slowly paced to deliver much excitement, let alone scares, while its respectable packaging elements are too conservative to provide enough atmosphere.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter laments that \\"Yakin's script wants to deal with some big issues\\" but \\"looking cool isn't quite enough to drive the action home.\\" Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com gave it 1¬Ω stars, writing, \\"Yakin's film offers little clarity with all of its hammy, left-field ideas, in spite of their originality when packaged as a horror movie.\\" He also opined that the acting by the young cast \\"is nothing to write home about\\". Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times complemented the ornate sets and Yakin's skill in generating atmosphere and tension. He concluded: \\" ... this is more a surreal, nightmarish and occasionally sexually explicit trip into an adolescent‚Äôs psyche than a spook show.

Aller Ulloa was a specialist in Double stars discovering 4 of them named after him (Aller1,Aller2,Aller3 and Aller4)\\"Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller Ulloa\\" and inventor of several devices used for measurements and observation.\\"Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller Ulloa\\" Biography He began his studies on the school owned by the Society of Jesus in the city of A Guarda (Pontevedra), to continue in the theological seminary of Lugo. While being only 20 years old he obtained his bachelor and doctorate in Sacred Theology and so he was ordered priest within the next two years. In 1899 he started science studies in the University of Oviedo, finishing them in the University of Madrid in 1904 graduating with honours. His first astronomical studies began with a present of his grandmother, a monocular of 67mm. Later on, as a second present, he received a theodolite, which improved his first observations. With these first two simple devices he started writing his home observations and mailing them to scientific publications. It is on 1912 when the \\"Anuario del Observatorio de Madrid\\" published his first paper \\"Observaciones del cometa de Joannesburgo 1910a\\". In 1917 he built a homemade observatory on his garden. With the inheritance of his passed uncle he decided to acquire a refracting telescope Steinheil of 120 mm. aperture and 1800 mm. focal length. Due to the size of all his new equipment he needed to acquire a dome to protect it. Straight after his new device arrived he prepared a detailed scientific program to optimise its results in the observation of his new interests, double stars, exams of planet surfaces and a last phase of \\"occasional observations\\" as eclipses, comets or meteoroids. From this point his scientific publications grow substantially, with publications in the German \\"Astronomische Nachrichten\\" and the French \\"L'Astranomie\\". Due to the good quality of the data received in several European observatories assumed that in Lal√≠n existed a team of researches, ignoring that the data was coming from a homemade observatory and a single scientist. Aller Ulloa was recognized by his European counterparts as polyglot, speaking 10 different languages. In 1928 he was elected as a member in the Seminario de Estudos Galegos, in 1939 a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences. From 1940 he began teaching analytic geometry and mathematical analysis in the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC), in 1942 he joined the Royal Galician Academy. In 1943 he receives his second PhD, this time in astronomy by the University of Madrid. He died at Lal√≠n at the age of 88. Scientific findings Aller Ulloa discovered 4 double stars: 1. Aller 1 (2000.0): 21 55.9 + 19 47, Mag: 9,3 ‚Äì 9,5; 2. Aller 2 (2000.0): 00 34.5 ‚Äì 04 33 AB-D, Mag: 6,8 ‚Äì 8,8; 3. Aller 3 (2000.0): 18 59,3 + 03 31 AB, Mag: 8,9 ‚Äì 9,1; 4. Aller 4 (2000.0): 17 57.8 + 27 50, Mag: 8,9 ‚Äì 9,9. Moreover, he is recognized as the first Spanish in calculating the orbit of a double star system in the country, the STT 77. It follows the appointment of Aller as a member of the ‚ÄúInternational Astronomical Union Commission 26 (double stars)‚Äù in 1948 (Zurich). The following year he was named a member of the National Commission on Astronomy. The professor Aller Ulloa also designed and built devices for measuring and observation purchased by the Paris Observatory; he suggested modifications on the production of the astrograph to the German manufacture Zeiss, which accepted them and afterwards did not accept the payment of Aller Ulloa for the device as appreciation for the improvements; a clock of sidereal time; a base for the portable vertical circle monocular, etc...\\"Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller Ulloa\\" Contistuted by his two main research lines double stars and the methods to determine coordinates based on two vertical lanes he published 78 articles in especialized publications in Europe, 4 books and he directed 5 PhD thesis (Between 1960 and 1963, in spite of being 83 years old, Aller still directed three theses: M√∫gica Buhigas's ‚Äúber die Anwendung des Theodolits in der Geodtischen Astronomia‚Äù (Munich, 1960); Zaera de Toledo's ‚ÄúOn determining the Orbits of Visual Double Stars. A Study of Various Methods. Applications‚Äù (Zaragoza, 1962); and Ferr√≠n Moreiras‚Äô ‚ÄúObservations of Transits Across Two Vertical Circles‚Äù (Santiago, 1963)) As secondary topics he studied and published about meteors, planet surfaces, tooling, auroras (describing one visible in Lal√≠n in 1938\\"Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Aller Ulloa\\" ), eclipses, transits, details on the construction of his homemade observatories, biographies, as the one for the mathematician Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Gonz√°lez, etc... Moon crater The English astronomers Hugh Percy Wilkins and Patrick Moore, specialized on moon observations, named a Lunar crater \\"Aller\\". On their book The moon published on 1955 they place it at : 5.8¬∞S, Longitude: 57.7¬∞E. Nevertheless, the current name of the crater is named in honour of the English mathematician George Atwood, it was introduced provisionally by this name on 1974 and it was adopted officially by the IAU on 1976, today the crater is known as Atwood. The crater is inside the Mare Fecunditatis 5.8¬∞S 57.7¬∞E, with a diameter of 28,64 km and 2,5 km depth.

After serving during the Second World War, he stayed on in the RAF and attained the rank of squadron leader. After he left the service he wrote a number of books on the RAF, three of which described his own experiences as a bomber pilot. His books portray life as it was in RAF Bomber Command during the course of the Second World War. Currie served as narrator in three BBC documentaries on the air war over Europe. Early life Currie was born in Sheffield, the son of John Alban William Currie and Margaret Ulph Ward-Smith. While he was still a young child the family moved to Harrow, London. Currie was taken to air shows, where he became fascinated with aeroplanes. After leaving school he worked a variety of jobs, including cartoonist for the Harrow Observer. On occasion his cartoons were featured on the pages of national publications such as Punch. In the evenings Currie sang for a dance band. With the outbreak of war in 1939 Currie volunteered to serve in the Royal Air Force. He scored well on the aptitude tests and was placed on the deferred service list to await pilot training. While awaiting his call up he volunteered as a stretcher bearer and ambulance driver during the London blitz. He also served as an ARP runner. Second World War =Flight training= AT-10 trainer, Georgia 1943 In 1941 Currie was called up to serve in the RAF. He completed his initial training in England, undergoing dual instruction on Tiger Moths at RAF Ansty. He was then shipped to the state of Georgia for pilot training by the United States Army Air Corps under the Arnold Scheme.Jack Currie. Wings Over Georgia. Goodall Publications Ltd. 1989 p. 31 In early 1942, he soloed at Souther Field, near Americus, Georgia. Souther was the same field where Charles Lindbergh had first soloed. After finishing his initial training at Souther, Currie moved on to Cochran Field, near Cochran, Georgia, for further training.Currie, Jack. (1995). Wings Over Georgia. Crecy Publishing. p 59; p 86. His penchant for low flying nearly resulted in his being failed out of primary flying school. Near the end of his Basic course he was flying low over a river when he discovered a second Stearman trainer coming up on him from behind. Thinking it rather bold for another student to attempt to gain a firing position, Currie put his airplane through a sharp, climbing turn. He discovered the other plane was flown well, and was able to regain its position. With that Currie put in a series of hard maneuvers, finally gaining the upper hand. Pulling up alongside, he waved but got no response. Shortly after returning he was called up to see the top flight instructor at the base. The other pilot had been no student, but was the base's chief flight instructor. Low level flying was an automatic wash-out offense. Learning of what had happened, Currie's instructor spoke up for him, and through his intervention Currie was able to stay on, though he was saddled with a heavy penalty in \\"tours\\" and had to forfeit leave between courses. At the completion of his training Currie was rated \\"above average\\" and offered a commission in exchange for staying on in Georgia as a pilot instructor. Wanting to return to the United Kingdom and fly operations, he declined the offer. This struck the review board as odd, so as an excuse for declining the commission he claimed he felt he was too young to be an officer. The board understood there was more to it, but declined to question him further and allowed him to return to England. =Forming a crew= Currie earned his wings and returned to the United Kingdom in late 1942, being posted to Bomber Command as a sergeant pilot. He was sent for further training at an Operational Training Unit, and received final training at a Heavy Conversion Unit, where he collected a crew. His crew was assembled in the usual RAF manner. All the trainees were placed in a large hangar and sorted themselves out on their own into crews. Currie was approached by navigator Jimmy Cassidy, and the two of them collected the rest. Currie's flight crew comprised Sergeant Pilot Jack Currie (pilot), Pilot Officer Jimmy Cassidy (navigator), Flight Sergeant Larry Myring (bomb aimer), Sergeant \\"Johnny\\" Walker (flight engineer), Sergeant Charlie Fairbairn (wireless operator), Sergeant George Protheroe (mid upper gunner) and Sergeant Charles Lanham (rear gunner). All were on their first operational tour. Lanham had already completed 9 sorties from a previous posting. He had been removed from his first crew and placed on disciplinary duty for 6 months after he punched his pilot for drinking alcohol too near to their flight time. Shortly after making Currie's acquaintance, Lanham made his feelings on the subject clear. \\"I don‚Äôt reckon grog mixes with flying, and I aim to survive this war.\\" Replied Currie \\"So do I. And just to set your mind at ease, I only drink on leave or stand downs.\\" \\"You ought to cut that out too, skipper. Grog slows your reactions.\\" The only officer on board was the navigator, Pilot Officer Cassidy. Three of the crew, Cassidy, Myring and Lanham, were Australian. The other four were British. =First tour= A Lancaster warms up its engines in preparation for a mission over the continent In June 1943 Currie and his crew were posted to 12 Squadron based at RAF Wickenby. The squadron was equipped with the Avro Lancaster. Currie's crew were part of the squadron's \\"C\\" Flight. On 3 July 1943 Currie flew his first mission as second pilot to Flight Lieutenant Benjamin McLaughlin on a mission to Cologne. McLaughlin was an experienced pilot with a DFC to his credit. Three days later Currie piloted his own aircraft and crew on their first operation together, laying mines in the Bay of Biscay. Following these two shake down flights Currie and his crew began regular operations with the rest of 12 Squadron. In August Currie was commissioned as a pilot officer. On their fifth mission the squadron was sent to bomb Hamburg. The flight became their most difficult sortie. Over the target they flew into a heavy storm. While evading Flak the aircraft went into a cloud, was tossed onto its back and fell into a steep dive. Currie had the sense that he had lost all control of the aircraft. Struggling with the controls he felt something give way. They lost 10,000 feet and Currie instructed the crew to prepare to bail out. Just at that moment he was able to pull out, but the Lancaster did not feel right. He soon found it was extremely difficult to turn the aircraft. In the intense winds of the storm both ailerons had been ripped from the wings of the aircraft. With the rudder he could change the direction the aircraft was pointing, but without the ailerons he could not bank to change the direction of flight. The plane would just skid sideways and return to its original heading. Thinking about the principles he learned in flight school, he realized by increasing the power to the outer engine he could use the torque of the propeller to lift the wing and bank the aircraft. He succeeded in turning the aircraft toward home, but control of pitch and yaw was very difficult to maintain. Reaching England, he doubted he could maintain adequate control of the aircraft to land safely, and advised his crew to bail out. Lanham asked \\"What are you going to do, Jack?\\" \\"I'm going to put her down at base, but I might make a balls of it.\\" \\"You wont. This is your lucky night. I'm staying on board.\\" The rest of the crew followed suit, and though Currie warned them again to take to the chutes, there were no takers. With no aileron controls the wings continued to rock and dip up and down, and with no flaps the landing speed had to be high to avoid stalling. Currie found the wing's rotation could not be checked with power control, but it could be timed. He brought her in low and fast, and dropped her wheels down hard on the tarmac just as she leveled out. In debriefing the station commander commented \\"Not one of your better landings, Currie.\\" \\"No sir. If I had known you were watching I would have tried harder.\\" When it was learned that Currie made the landing with no aileron control or flaps the station commander could not believe it. Inspection of the Lancaster soon confirmed the astonishing fact that the ailerons had indeed been torn right off the wings during the storm. The aircraft should have crashed in Germany. The squadron commander immediately recommended Currie for a Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, but this was turned down. On completion of his first operational tour Currie was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission, as was Cassidy and Lanham, and the Distinguished Flying Medal was awarded to Fairbairn. Photo- reconnaissance image of V-2 test site at Peenem√ºnde, 23 June 1943 As the summer of 1943 unfolded Currie and his crew flew a mission to Mannheim, several missions to Milan, and then on the night of 17/18 August a trip to a secret weapons facility at the German coastal town of Peenem√ºnde. The crews were told the site was being used by the Germans to develop a new radar guided night fighter, but the truth was the Air Ministry targeted it because they had learned the Germans were developing a new weapon there, the V-2 rocket. This may have been the most important mission Currie and his crew participated in. On their way in to the target they were attacked 4 times by German night fighters, but were able to evade. The mid-upper gunner, George Protheroe, put a stream of .303 machine gun fire into one and may have shot him down. Bomber Command lost 40 aircraft on the mission, including that of the A Flight commander from 12 Squadron, but the V-2 rocket program was set back a crucial two months. With Bomber Command expanding, on 7 November 1943 12 Squadron's \\"C\\" Flight was hived off and used to form the basis of a new squadron, No. 626 Squadron RAF. The new unit would share the field at Wickenby with 12 Squadron. Currie's feisty Australian tail-gunner, Charlie Lanham, finished his tour slightly ahead of the rest of the crew, having completed 9 sorties before joining with Currie. As Currie's total trips approached the magic mark of 30 he began to wonder if they would in fact beat the odds and survive their first tour. Their second to last mission was against their hardest target, a target crews liked to call \\"The Big City.\\" It was part of Butch Harris' four month campaign against Berlin, a campaign that Bomber Command was in the process of losing. Currie and crew survived the trip. With its completion Currie was looking forward to a milk run in the next few days to end his tour. Instead he awoke the next morning to learn he was up for ops again that night. Worse, the target was again‚Ä¶ Berlin. Furious that his final mission was back to one of the continent's most distant and dangerous targets, Currie went to argue with his flight commander, but he could make no odds. The CO reassured him that waiting for a few days for a final op was a mistake, and that it was all for the best. Currie and his crew set out for their final mission, and completed it without incident. Their first tour was completed in February 1944. =Pilot instructor= Mosquito of 1409 Meteorological Flight After a period of leave Currie was posted to 1662 Heavy Conversion Unit based at RAF Blyton and qualified as an instructor flying the Handley Page Halifax. He spent most of his time training Polish pilots in the handling of the Halifax. Promoted to flying officer, he spent several months at Blyton before being posted to RAF Sandtoft. =Second tour= Currie was reassigned and trained to fly the Mosquito. Though no posts were coming open, a navigator who was an officer asked if he would want to apply for the Pathfinder Force. He was accepted, and assigned to their weather unit, the 1409 Meteorological Flight. Currie ended the war flying for the Pathfinders on weather prediction missions. After the war After the war Currie applied for and received a permanent commission. In the following years he served at RAF Lindholme, RAF West Kirby, RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus, and at RAF Syerston. While posted at Syerston in 1959 he came to live in Newark. He retired from the RAF in 1964 with the rank of squadron leader. Currie worked as Civil Defence Officer for Newark from 1964 till 1970, when the government closed down most of their Civil Defense operations. While living in Newark he became involved in the town cricket club and the Robin Hood Theatre at Averham, where he involved himself in theatrical productions, notably playing the king in the Newark Amateur Operatic Society's 1961 production of The King and I. In 1970 he moved his family to London to take up a position as south east area secretary in organising small scale air shows. Over time these grew and developed into the RAF Benevolent Fund's annual Royal International Air Tattoo. In 1975 Currie moved to Easingwold near York to present Civil Defence lectures at the Home Defence College. He retired in 1986. Lancaster of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Throughout his life Currie held a deep admiration for the Lancaster bomber, which he flew during his first tour. When the war was finally over neither Bomber Command nor its crews and personnel received the recognition deserved for those who had carried the war effort for five years and had sacrificed so much. In the 1970s and 1980s Currie addressed this oversight by writing a number of books detailing the experiences of his and other crews who took part in the RAF's bombing campaign. The books he wrote about his personal experience gave the reader a first hand account of just what it was like to fly from Wickenby on some of the war's most difficult raids. It was said in the press that \\"he wrote with a warmth and humour that belied the extreme peril he and his crew faced on a daily basis.\\" Through his writing he was asked to participate in a number of BBC television documentaries on the Royal Air Force, which he narrated. These included The Lancaster Legend, The Augsburg Raid and The Watchtower. A highlight of his later years was when he was asked to join the RAF crew of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Lancaster, and took the controls while over Lincolnshire. Personal life Currie was twice married. He met his first wife, Nina, while he was a pilot instructor. He married a second time, and his second wife Kate survived him.

He is a member of India's indigenous tribal people, like his predecessor as Archbishop of Ranchi, Cardinal Telesphore Toppo. The two are not related  Biography  He was born on 21 November 1947 in Tongo, in the Diocese of Gumla in Jharkhand. He joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1968. He was ordained a priest for the Society of Jesus on 14 April 1982. Within the Jesuits he has at times been director of pre-novices, novice master and superior. He earned a master's degree in psychology from the Gregorian University, Rome, in 1990. Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Jamshedpur on 14 June 1997. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Telesphore Placidus Toppo on 27 September 1997. Toppo was the first tribal to head the Diocese. He chaired the CBCI Office for Clergy and Religious and headed the National Vocation Service Centre in Pune for four years. In 2016, in an essay he contributed to a volume on gender and justice, he wrote that the Church's patriarchal structure had immediate consequences for women: \\"In the Church men traditionally are given the authoritative and leadership positions and women, religious or lay, are assigned generally to subservient roles rather than to decision making positions.\\" On 24 June 2018 Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Ranchi. He was installed there on 6 August. That same month, he confronted civil authorities, controlled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, when they initiated investigations of Catholic NGOs accused of \\"proselytization activities through inducement\\". He said no specifics were provided and complained that \\"nothing of the sort happens with pro-Hindu organizations\\". He said the probes were designed to divide the Catholic and Hindu within the tribal population in advance of elections. In December he praised the government for protecting tribal land rights by denying the right to purchase tribal lands to the non-tribal husband of a tribal woman. As of 2018, he chaired the governing body of the Society for Medical Education, North India, of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI), which built a hospital to provide care for the tribal people and the poor. He was chairperson of the Regional Bishops' Council of Jharkhand and Andaman. He was also vice-chancellor of St. Albert's College, Ranchi, the region's major seminary. Within the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India, he was one of three members of the Commission for Vocations, Seminarians, Clergy and Religious.

Early life  Michael Begg was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was raised in the suburb of Currie. He attended Currie High School from 1978 to 1983 before enrolling in Chelsea College of Arts in London in 1984. Begg returned to Scotland in 1989 because of debt. In Edinburgh, he became involved in theatre production as co-artistic director of Cerberus Theatre Company, and taught creative writing, music and theatre skills to various mental health groups.  Music career  In 2000, making use of new affordable computer technologies, he began to experiment in computer mediated composition. Along with long time collaborator Deryk Thomas, he produced a series of recordings intended for use in theatre which became the first Human Greed album, Consolation. Consolation was released in 2001 on Steven Severin's short lived RE: Records label. The name Human Greed arose from the title of a play for which Begg intended the music to inhabit.Blow Up Magazine, Italy, September 2011 Begg and Thomas have to date released four further albums under the group name Human Greed. Their most recent album, World Fair, was warmly received in 2014, making the end of year \\"best-of\\" lists, including the influential USA based Brainwashed list. He began contributing to Clodagh Simonds' Fovea Hex project in 2007 with an appearance on the track \\"Long Distance\\" on the EP Allure, the third part of the Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent trilogy. He has since appeared on every subsequent Fovea Hex recording, and is a core member of the performing iteration of the ensemble. In 2009, Begg was commissioned by Edinburgh City Council and Unique Events to produce a soundscape work to be performed in the city's St. Giles' Cathedral. This was undertaken as a collaboration with Colin Potter. The resulting work, Fragile Pitches, was described by the Glasgow Herald as \\"In turns eerie, contemplative and majestically other-worldly‚Ä¶ magnificently put the avant-garde into a populist arena without ever labouring the point.\\" Begg has released a number of recordings in his own name, working more progressively towards a territory comprising site specific thematic work, contemporary classical music, and studio experimenting. In 2016, he was commissioned by Public Art promoters Artichoke to provide music for the BBC broadcast of London 1666. The programme documented the floating and subsequent burning of sculptor David Best's floating model of the city of London on the river Thames. In 2017, he was commissioned by Glasgow Cryptic to compose a new electronic work for Sonica 2017. The work was situated in the wheelhouse of the Titan Clydebank. The work received praise from the national press and earned Begg a New Music Scotland Award 2018. In 2018, Begg formed and became artistic director for the Black Glass Ensemble, a combination of chamber players and electronic experimentalists. He continues to provide composition and sound design for Moscow based blackSKYwhite theatre company, and writes about music for publications including The Quietus, Sound on Sound, Audio Media International, and Total Theatre.

History =Foundation and activity= The Chowringhee Theatre was situated on Chowringhee Road. Several short-lived theatres had been founded in the city since the Calcutta Theatre, but the Chowringhee Theatre was to be its first successful successor. The theatre was built on funds by private donations on subscriptions by shares of 100 Rs each. It was able to accommodate 300 people and was thereby the most spacious theatre in Calcutta at the time. Notably, \\"almost all the prominent actors and actresses of the time joined the theatre\\", among them being \\"Mr. Stocqueler, Mr. Parker, Mrs. Bland, Mr Francis. Mrs. Gottlieb, Mrs. Goodall, Mr. Atkinson, Mrs. Chester, Mrs Francis, Mrs Jones\\", William Linton, Henry Meredith Parker, Thomas Allosps\\" and foremost Esther Leach, who became one of the star attractions of the theatre, and D. L. Richardson became renowned as a director. The theater was protected by the Governor-General and became one of the leading theatres in Calcutta and India. Reviews of the performances at the theatre were regularly published in the press, particularly the Calcutta Gazette and The Calcutta Journal. The theatre often staged Shakespeare: Macbeth was staged on 1 April 1814 with great success, followed by 'Henry V (1815), Coriolanus (18.1.1824), Macbeth (27.2.1824), Richard III (19.12.1828) and 'The Merchant of Venice (2.1.1829). The actors and the performances were generally given favorable reviews and came to be regarded for its high standards. =Impact= Chowringhee Theatre was the first English theatre more frequented also by Indians, and inspired the development of English style theatre among Indians. The Indian Bengali elites such as Prince Dwarakanath Tagore, Babu Prasanno Coomar Tagore, Raja Radhakanto Deb, Sri Kissen Singh and Kiehen Chandra Dutt acted as patrons and frequented the theatre, the Hindu Theatrical Association was founded by Prasanna Coomar Tagore in 1831, establishing the first native theatre, 'The Hindoo theatre', followed by Nabin Chandra Bose's theatre (1835), and the Indian aristocracy of Calcutta built English style theatres in their gardens, where they staged Sanskrit plays. =Closure= The theatre stimulated the foundation of two rivals, Dum Dum theatre (1817-1824) and the Boitaconnah Theatre (founded in 1824), but neither could stand the competition of the Chowringhee Theatre. By 1835, however, the theatre experienced severe financial difficulty and Prince Dwaraka Nath Tagore successfully suggested that it be sold. This, however, resulted in a drain of patrons and actors from the theatre. The Chowringhee Theatre was destroyed by fire on 31 May 1838 and replaced the following year by the Sans Souci Theatre (1839-1849), founded by one of the Chowringhee Theatre's star actors Esther Leach.

Many commentators felt that her reputation never entirely escaped from the shadow cast by her enthusiasm, as a young woman, for National Socialism.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Gertrud Anna Fussenegger was born in Pilsen, a flourishing manufacturing city in Bohemia which at that time was a Crown land of the Austrian Empire. She came from a military family. Emil Fussenegger, her father, was an Imperial and Royal army officer originally from Vorarlberg. Her mother, born Karoline H√§ssler, was from Bohemia. She grew up in Neu Sandez (then in Galicia), Dornbirn (Vorarlberg) and Telfs (North Tirol). She enrolled at the M√§dchen-Realgymnasium (girls' secondary school) in Innsbruck in 1923. After her mother died in 1926 she moved back to Pilsen ‚Äì by now part of Czechoslovakia ‚Äì where she lived with her grandparents. It was at the \\"Reform- Realgymnasium\\" (school) in Pilsen that Fussenegger completed her schooling, passing her Matura (school final exams) in 1930. She later confided in her diaries that she sometimes felt a little regretful, listening uncomprehendingly to the chattering of her grandparents' Bohemian-born domestic servants, that having lived almost all of her first fourteen years in other parts of Austria, she had not more effectively mastered the Czech language. She went on to study history, art history and philosophy at Innsbruck (7 terms) and Munich(1 term). It was from the University of Innsbruck that in 1934 she received her doctorate. Her dissertation concerned the Roman de la Rose by Jean de Meun (\\"Gemeinschaft und Gemeinschaftsbildung im Rosenroman von Jean Clopinel von Meun\\"). = Politics = Fussenegger joined the Austrian National Socialist party ‚Äì still at this stage formally separate from its German counterpart ‚Äì in May 1933.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, S. 172. Membership was still illegal in Austria. In May 1934 she participated in a demonstration in Innsbruck at which, it was reported, she had joined in singing of the Horst-Wessel song and gave a Hitler salute. She was charged, convicted and fined. According to one source she was also banned from further study at any Austrian university. In February 1935 she was still a member of another Austrian National Socialist student group, but later that year, in or before November, she relocated to Germany. In March 1938, following an invasion from the north that met with little practical resistance, Austria was incorporated into an enlarged German state, albeit under very different circumstances from those that most nineteenth century proponents of such a \\"solution\\" would have anticipated. Gertrud Fussenegger, who by now was probably living in Munich, \\"rejoined\\" the ruling National Socialist party: her membership number was 6,229,747, which is consistent with her having joined the party in 1938. For the avoidance of doubt, she also wrote a \\"hymn\\" eulogising Adolf Hitler. In 1938 the first newspaper to publish her poem \\"Stimme der Ostmark\\" (\\"Voice of the Ostmark\\") was the V√∂lkischer Beobachter (\\"Popular Observer\\"), the mass-circulation daily newspaper of the NSDAP. = Family = In 1935 Fussenegger married the Bavarian sculptor Elmar Dietz. By the time it ended in divorce twelve years later the marriage had produced four recorded children, including the artist Ricarda Dietz. The marriage was not happy. In 1943 she left Munich and settled at Hall in Tirol where she lived with her four children as a single parent. Her second marriage was to another sculptor. In 1950 Gertrud Fussenegger married Alois Dorn. This marriage resulted in the birth of her second son and fifth child. Divorce at this time was unusual, especially for a committed member of the Roman Catholic Church. Fussenegger's own insights, reported by a Catholic newspaper, are instructive: :\\"Since my second marriage was simply a civil one, for a long time I was not permitted to receive the sacraments. I found that deeply painful, but the pain also became very productive for me. It was the only way I could come to a recognition of the full preciousness of the Eucharist. I therefore cannot regret the bitter tears I often shed at that time. That ban was actually a gift.\\" :\\"Da meine zweite Ehe nur standesamtlich geschlossen war, war ich sehr lange von den Sakramenten ausgeschlossen. Das habe ich als tief schmerzlich empfunden, doch es war ein Schmerz, der auch sehr fruchtbar f√ºr mich geworden ist. Nur so ist mir die ganze Kostbarkeit der Eucharistie bewusst geworden. Ich kann es nicht bedauern, dass ich in jener Zeit oft bittere Tr√§nen vergossen habe. Genau genommen war ich beschenkt durch das Verbot.\\" In 1961 she relocated with her family, settling this time in Leonding, a small town near Linz.  Memberships and recognition  Gertrud Fussenegger was a member of the Austrian P.E.N. association, of the Humboldt Society, of the Sudeten German Academy and an honorary member of the Austrian Writers' Association. Between 1977 and 1979, and again from 1984 till 1985, she was a jury member for the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, awarded each year in Klagenfurt. In 1991 she was a jury member for the Franz-Grillparzer Prize of the Alfred Toepfer foundation. In 1978 she was honoured with an award from the Humboldt Society. Gertrude Gussenegger's literary archive is held by the Upper Austria Literature Archive at the Stifterhaus in Linz.  Artistic output  Fussnegger began her writing career with historical novels, set in various different epochs. Her stories were influenced by her Catholic provenance. She was conscious of her reliance on the \\"renouveau catholique\\" movement which had originated in France but during the twentieth century became more of an international phenomenon. That reliance is particularly pronounced in her novel \\"Zeit des Raben, Zeit der Taube\\" (1960: \\"Time of the raven: time of the dove\\").Hannelore Schlaffer: Zeit des Raben, Zeit der Taube. In: S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. Nr. 106, 10 May 2010, p. 14. Gertrud Fassenegger authored more than sixty books, alongside various shorter prose pieces and poems, published, according to at least one source, by 25 publishers and translated into eleven languages. = Fussenegger and the Third Reich = Fussenegger's relationship with National Socialism did much to define both her early writing career and a degree of controversy around her person which never completely went away. She joined the NSDAP in Austria in 1933 and rejoined it in Germany after the Anschluss in 1938. In 1939 she became a member of the government-created Reichsschrifttumskammer (loosely, \\"national chamber of writers\\" / RSK).Carina Steeger: Gertrud Fussenegger ‚Äì Autorin im Widerspruch? In: Rolf D√ºsterberg (Hrsg.): Dichter f√ºr das ‚ÄûDritte Reich‚Äú. Band 4: Biografische Studien zum Verh√§ltnis von Literatur und Ideologie. Aisthesis, Bielefeld 2018, pp. 185, 193f., 199, 202f & 207. She took part on the Weimar Poets' Congress in 1938 and again in 1939, and was in touch with well-known \\"v√∂lkisch\\" authors such as Ina Seidel, Lulu von Strau√ü und Torney, Will Vesper and Wilhelm Pleyer. And yet, despite her commitment to the regime, literary objections to her work came out of the \\"Office for the Care of New Literature\\" (\\"Amt Schrifttumspflege\\") which operated under the direction of Hans Hagemeyer and, less directly, of the influential party ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. Two years after its publication one of her first books, \\"Mohrenlegende\\" (1937: loosely \\"Legends of the dark skinned ones\\") was (belatedly) banned by the party experts who now identified it as criticism of official race ideology and \\"Catholic dross\\" (\\"katholisches Machwerk\\"). Controversy about this particular work resurfaced in 1993 in connection with proposals to award Fussenegger the Weilheim Literature Prize and the Jean-Paul Prize awarded by \\"The Free State of Bavaria\\". Many of Fussenegger's other pieces, mostly during this period religiously contextualised novels, poems and reviews, found their way into important party newspapers and journals. Most (in)famously, her poem \\"Stimme der Ostmark\\" (\\"Voice of the Ostmark\\") was printed in 1938 by the V√∂lkischer Beobachter. The poem attracted huge criticism after 1945, because it celebrated the \\"peaceful annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany\\" and it eulogised Hitler. Around fifty years later Gertrud Fussenegger's comment on the affair was capable of various interpretations, but it fell short of an unambiguous recantation. She regretted having \\"wasted so much thinking time on something so loathsome\\" (\\"viele gute Gedanken verschwendet ... auf eine Sache, die dann ein Greuel war\\"). Fussnegger's attitude during the National Socialist period remains controversial. Between 1937 and 1941 27 of her contributions appeared in the V√∂lkischer Beobachter. Other publications with similar political slants that published her work included \\"Wille und Macht\\" and \\"Das Reich\\". In her more political moments she identified Adolf Hitler as a healing figure. = After 1945 = After 1945 the Anschluss was undone. The western two-thirds of Germany and the pre-1938 territory of Austria were both divided into military occupation zones, with Berlin and Vienna sub-divided between armies of the same four occupying powers. In Germany's Soviet occupation zone two of Fussenegger's novels, \\"Der Brautraub\\" (\\"The Bride Robbery\\": 1939) und \\"B√∂hmische Verzauberungen\\" (\\"Bohemian Enchantments\\": 1944) were included in the official four volume \\"List of Discarded Literature\\". In Vienna, too, several of her works were placed on the \\"List of banned authors and books\\". The postwar decades were productive ones for Gertrud Fussenegger as a novelist. Yet as late as 1952 she published a brief self-portrait in a literary journal which contained phrases chillingly redolent of National Socialist race ideology. She belonged to a race characterised by \\"fair skin, bright [blue] eyes, sensitive to bright light, a hybrid of nordic and dinaric features\\" (\\"... hellh√§utig, hell√§ugig, empfindlich gegen die Wirkung des Lichts, ein Mischtyp aus nordischen und dinarischen Z√ºgen\\").Gertrud Fussenegger: ‚ÄûAussage geschehenen Schicksals. Ein Selbstportrait‚Äú. In: Welt und Wort. Literarische Monatsschrift. (1952), p. 84. During the postwar period Fussenegger repeatedly wrestled with the \\"German guilt\\" question. One literary critic, Klaus Amann, described her 1979 autobiography \\"Ein Spiegelbild mit Feuers√§ule\\" (loosely, \\"mirror image with pillars of fire\\") as \\"overall a cringe-worthy offering of suppression and obduracy\\" (\\"...insgesamt ein peinliches Dokument der Verdr√§ngung und der Verstocktheit\\").Klaus Amann: Die Dichter und die Politik. Essays zur √∂sterreichischen Literatur nach 1918. Edition Falter/Deuticke, Wien 1992, , p. 295. Other less hostile commentators saw this autobiographical work as a kind of literary penance. During the Hitler years she had included in a 1943 travel report a powerfully horrific description of a Jewish cemetery she had visited in Prague. In it she had employed National Socialist antisemitic shibboleths and stereo-types to condemn the city's Jewish community for the dire condition of the place. In her 1979 autobiographical work she reproduced that description of the Jewish cemetery in Prague three and a half decades earlier, but she had \\"cleaned it up\\". She still reported \\"overflowing tombs\\", but removed references to Jewish differentness and degeneracy. The overall tone of the text was completely transformed.

It was approved for children less than two years old in 2019. It is used as a one- time injection into a vein with at least two months of corticosteroids. Common side effects include vomiting and increased liver enzymes. Onasemnogene abeparvovec works by providing a new copy of the gene that makes the human SMN protein. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019, and in Japan and the European Union in 2020. Medical uses Onasemnogene abeparvovec has been developed to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a disease linked to a mutation in the SMN1 gene on chromosome 5q and diagnosed predominantly in young children that causes progressive loss of muscle function and frequently death. The medication is administered as an intravenous infusion. The treatment is approved in the United States and certain other countries for use in children with SMA up to the age of two, including at the presymptomatic stage of the disease. In the European Union it is indicated for the treatment of patients with SMA who either have a clinical diagnosis of SMA type 1 or have up to three copies of the SMN2 gene. The medication is used with corticosteroids in an effort to protect the liver. While marketed as a one-time treatment for SMA, it is unknown how long the onasemnogene abeparvovec-delivered transgene will persist in people. Since motor neurons do not divide, it is expected that the transgene may have long- term stability. Adverse effects Common adverse reactions may include nausea and increased liver enzymes. Serious adverse reactions may include liver problems and low platelets. Transient elevated levels of cardiac troponin‚ÄëI were observed in clinical trials; the clinical importance of these findings is not known. However, cardiac toxicity was seen in studies of other animals. As the medication may reduce the platelet count, platelets may need to be checked before the medication is started, then weekly for the first month and every two weeks for the next two months until the level is back to baseline. Liver function should be monitored for three months after administration. Mechanism of action SMA is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene, which leads to a decrease in SMN protein, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a biologic drug consisting of AAV9 virus capsids that contains a SMN1 transgene along with synthetic promoters. Upon administration, the AAV9 viral vector delivers the SMN1 transgene to the affected motor neurons, where it leads to an increase in SMN protein. History Onasemnogene abeparvovec was developed by the US biotechnology startup AveXis, which was acquired by Novartis in 2018, based on the work of Martine Barkats from the Institut de Myologie in France. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi for fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and orphan drug designations. The FDA also awarded the manufacturer a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, and granted the approval of Zolgensma to AveXis Inc. In June 2015, the European Commission granted orphan designation for the drug. In July 2019, the drug was removed from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) accelerated assessment program. In May 2019, onasemnogene abeparvovec received US FDA approval as a treatment for children less than two years old. Since late 2019, the treatment has been reimbursed in Israel and Qatar. In March 2020, onasemnogene abeparvovec was granted regulatory approval in Japan with the label identical to the US one. Also in March 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended a conditional marketing authorization for use in people with SMA type 1 or with any SMA type and having no more than three copies of the SMN2 gene. In May 2020, Onasemnogene abeparvovec was conditionally approved in Europe. In August 2020, onasemnogene abeparvovec was granted regulatory approval in Brazil by ANVISA. Onasemnogene abeparvovec was added to the Australia Poisons Standard on Schedule 4 on 1 October 2020. Society and culture =Terminology= Onasemnogene abeparvovec is the international nonproprietary name (INN) and the US adopted name (USAN). The medication is known under compound name AVXS-101 in countries where it is not approved for marketing. =Cost= The drug carries a list price of per treatment, making it the most expensive medication in the world . In its first full quarter of sales of medication was sold. In Japan, the drug was made available through the public health care system on May 20, 2020, making it the most expensive drug covered by the Japanese public health care system.Âàù„ÅÆ„ÄåÂÑÑË∂Ö„ÅàÊñ∞Ëñ¨„Äç„Çæ„É´„Ç≤„É≥„Çπ„Éû„ÅÆËñ¨‰æ°„ÅØ„Å©„ÅÜÊ±∫„Åæ„Å£„Åü„Åã (Japanese).

Novartis Pharma. =Controversies= In the months leading up to the medication's approval by the FDA, a whistleblower informed Novartis that certain studies of the medication had been subject to data manipulation. Novartis fired two AveXis executives it determined responsible but informed the FDA of the data integrity issue only in June 2019, a month after the drug's approval. The delay drew strong condemnation of the FDA. In October 2019, the company admitted to not having informed the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for seven months about toxic effects of the intravenous formulation observed in laboratory animals. Due to data manipulation issue, the EMA withdrew their decision to allow an accelerated assessment of the medication. In December 2019, Novartis announced that it would donate 100 doses of onasemnogene abeparvovec per year to children outside the US through a global lottery. The decision, which has been claimed by Novartis to be based on a recommendation by unnamed bioethicists, was received with much criticism by the European Commission, some European healthcare regulators and patient groups (e.g., SMA Europe or the UK's TreatSMA) who see it as emotionally burdening, suboptimal, and ethically questionable. Novartis did not consult with families or doctors before announcing the scheme. Alan Regenberg, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, said that the scheme was perhaps the best available since it may be impossible to reliably establish prognosis for children under two years of age. Research AveXis is developing an intrathecal formulation of onasemnogene abeparvovec; however, trials in humans were halted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2019, due to observed animal toxicity.

She held her first solo exhibition in 1972 featuring abstract geometric paintings and continued exhibiting through 2003. She has works in the collections of the Byzantine Museum of the Archbishop Makarios III, the Loukia and Michalakis Zambelas Art Museum, the Municipal Art Gallery of Limassol and the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art. Early life Katy Fasouliotis was born in 1925 in Limassol, Cyprus. She was the daughter of Tasoula and Panos Fasouliotis. Her father was the editor of the Observer (Paratiritis) newspaper and she was the niece of George Fasouliotis, a cartoonist at the newspaper The Laugh (To Gelio). From a young age, she liked to draw and was encouraged to develop her talents. Between 1948 and 1955, she studied at the Athens School of Fine Arts taking painting courses with Umbertos Argyros and Yiannis Moralis and studying art history with Pandelis Prevelakis. Upon her graduation, Fasouliotis moved to London to take classes at the Saint Martin's School of Art and study the art in museums and galleries in both London and Paris until 1960. Career Upon completing her education, Stephanides returned to Cyprus in 1961 and began a career as a secondary school art teacher, instructing for the next twenty-five years. That same year, she participated in an exhibition organized by the magazine ŒöœÖœÄœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨ ŒßœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (Cypriot Chronicles) called \\"Cypriot Artists\\" and held in Athens. Her works in this early stage of her career reflected the early modern developments in international art in the 1950s and 1960s, showing cubist influences by such artists as Paul C√©zanne, Andr√© Lhote, and Kazimir Malevich. In the mid-1960s, she married the writer and painter Tasos Stephanides, with whom she would have two children, Panos, who would become a painter and Marina, later a writer. Over the next decade, she participated in numerous local and international exhibits including the 1963 Biennale of the Alexandria Museum of Fine Arts; 1970 Commonwealth Institute exhibition Contemporary Cypriot Art, which was shown in Edinburgh and London; and the 1971 S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in Brazil. In 1972, Stephanides held her first solo exhibit at the Acropolis Gallery, in Nicosia. most of the works presented were geometric abstractions which showed the influence of such painters as Naum Gabo, Piet Mondrian and Sophie Taeuber-Arp, but other pieces clearly embraced the Op art and Minimalism movements of the 1960s. She was interested in moving away from representing specific objects or nature, instead exploring essence of movement and form through space by the exploration of color, shape, and texture. In 1974, after the Cypriot coup d'√©tat Stephanides style changed and she began introducing references to Greek history into her works as a political statement. Particularly concerned about how war impacts women, her works began to explore stylized female forms and isolation, in a more expressionistic manner. Using symbolism in her paintings, such as representations of Aphrodite and the mountains of Pentadaktylos, she used Greek references to both reference the detachment and separation from Cyprus' Hellenistic past and as commentary on the political events that were occurring in the period. In 1978, Stephanides held her second solo show at Zygos Gallery in Nicosia, which presented both some of her older works and previous style, as well as a series entitled \\"The Depth of the World\\" which showed her new focus on unidentified female figures and the limits imposed upon humans by world events. In her third solo exhibition, held in 1982, Stephanides' art embraces Surrealism and Pop Art. Throughout the 1980s, she continued to explore the idea of limits placed on women in society, using symbols like the telephone or traffic signs to communicate boundaries. By the time of her 4th solo exhibition in 1988, held at Nicosia's Apocalypse Gallery, her works had moved to an exploration of color, form, and movement with an expressionistic fluidity in their composition. Stephanides work returned to pure abstraction in her 5th solo exhibit held at the Morfi Gallery in Limassol and even more so in her 6th solo showing at the Apocalypse Gallery, in which works focused on smooth vivid colors in flat space devoid of depth and volume. In her 1998 exhibition at the Apocalypse Gallery, Stephanides introduced thematic elements from traditional handworks, such as tapestry and embroidery. Blurring the lines between fine art and folk art, she used motifs to represent femininity. In 2003, in an exhibit Metamorphoses, hosted at the Argo Gallery in Nicosia, she expanded on these themes, bringing in references to folklore and spirituality, though in a thoroughly modern presentation strictly balancing the organization and vertical development in vivid colors on a flat surface lacking perspective of a third dimension. Death and legacy Stephanides died on 24 March 2012. She is remembered as one of the leading figures of the 20th century, who developed modern art in Cyprus. The art historian Eleni Nikita, characterized Stephanides place as a pioneer, stating that her work \\"created a bridge for Cypriot art to reach the point it is at today\\". She has works in the collections of the Byzantine Museum of the Archbishop Makarios III, the Loukia and Michalakis Zambelas Art Museum, the Municipal Art Gallery of Limassol and the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art. In 2013, the Apocalypse Gallery hosted Descendance, an exhibition which featured previously unexhibited works by Stephanides, her husband, Tasos, and her son, Panos.

Fruit packing quickly became the main industry of Meyers Falls (now Kettle Falls).\\"Some Pertinent Facts and Information Concerning Stevens County\\", Washington State, 1939 The warehouse was built in 1906 by a co-op of orchardists, on land owned by the railroad, right next to the tracks. The building was set up so that horses with wagon loads of fruit could drive into the basement from the west end of the building, drop off their loads, and exit through the east end of the building. In 1910, an addition was built on the east end, which effectively doubled the size of the warehouse. Porches were added, and large doors were installed on both sides of the building for loading and unloading. As an example of quantity of fruit processed in the warehouse, 40 railcars of fruit were processed through the depot in 1906. After the flooding of 1939 due to the Grand Coulee Dam, fruit processing volumes plummeted, but the warehouse was still used as the main processing and shipping point for northeastern Stevens County. Current State The Old Apple Warehouse serves as a quasi-town center for Kettle Falls. Housing a grocery store, coffee company, and antique store, it is immediately recognizable when passing through the main stretch of highway of the town.Hansen, Brandon, \\"'Crandall Coffee moves into Old Apple Warehouse,\\" The Statesman Examiner, 2017 In addition, the building houses a beauty parlor.

It encompasses over 10,000 acres and preserves a portion of the San Tan Mountains, south of Queen Creek. Gold Mountain in San Tan Mountains Regional Park Description Comprising over 10,200 acres in the Sonoran Desert, the park sits south of Queen Creek Arizona and preserves a portion of the San Tan Mountains, located on their northeastern flank. It is located approximately 30 miles southeast of downtown Phoenix. Higley Basin is its northern border, while Chandler Heights sits to its northwest. The western and southern portions of the park are bordered by the Gila River Indian Reservation. The elevation of the park varies between 1,400 to 2,500 feet, with the highest point in the park situated in the Malpais Hills at 2,539 feet. Goldmine Mountain which sits in the northern section of the park, with the Malpais Hills in the south, between them sit an unnamed central highlands. These three mountain groups rise above the general plain of the park, which sits at 1500 feet. Proterozoic and Laramide granites are the predominate geology of the park, while Mid-Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks overlay Proterozoic and Cretaceous crystalline rocks in the central and eastern portions. The majority of exposed bedrock is either granite or schist, with rhyolitic volcanics existing in the northern Malpais Hills. The climate consists of hot summers and mild winters, with average monthly temperatures ranging from a high of 104 degrees Fahrenheit in July to a low of 65.1 degrees in January. The park averages about 8.95 inches of rain per year, with almost 60% of that during the warm May to October season. The vegetation varies from creosote flats to saguaro forest. Fauna include reptiles, birds, and mammals. The vegetation falls into the Sonoran Desertscrub category, in the Arizona Upland vegetation subdivision, the wettest subdivision of the category. Within the park the flora falls into 239 taxa, broken into 52 families, 171 genera and 238 species, with approximately 90% of the species being indigenous. The 10% of non-indigenous plants consist of 24 species. Almost 47% of the park's flora comes from five families: Asteraceae (35 genera, 42 species, 17.6%); Poaceae (20 genera, 26 species, 10.9%); Fabaceae (10 genera, 17 species, 7.1%); Boraginaceae (6 genera, 14 species, 5.9%); and Cactaceae (6 genera, 13 species, 5.4%). Some of the Asteraceae species include: San Felipe dogweed, Triangle-Leaf Bursage, Desert Broom, Desert Marigold, Brittlebush, Arizona Cottonrose, Burrobush, and Woollyhead neststraw. Examples of Poaceae include: Purple threeawn, Arizona brome, Red Brome, Bermuda Grass, desert fluff-grass, Bigelow's bluegrass, and Sixweeks fescue. Fabaceae is represented by Catclaw acacia, Coastal bird's-foot trefoil, hairy lotus, Mojave lupine, ironwood, Foothills paloverde, and Velvet Mesquite. Examples of Boraginaceae include: Common fiddleneck, Panamint cryptantha, broad-nutted comb bur, and Arizona popcornflower. The Cactaceae are represented by: saguaro, Buckhorn Cholla, teddy bear cholla, Engelmann's hedgehog cactus, and the barrel cactus. The park is mostly used for recreational uses such as horseback riding and hiking. In June 2003 a master plan was produced which called for development of the park to account for increased use, which will protect historical sites, vegetation and habitat. Special use areas will be created, and fencing to ward off sensitive areas, and closing off illegal access points. Trails and roads will be built or rehabilitated. There are also extensive mountain biking trails, consisting entirely of doubletrack trails. There is an educational area detailing the lives of the desert tortoise. As of 2018, there were nine hiking trails located in the park. They include the Little Leaf Trail (0.7 mile), Stargazer Trail (0.8 mile), the Hedgehog Trail (1 mile), Moonlight Trail (1.3 miles), and San Tan Trail (6.4 miles). The Gold Mine Trail (2.5 miles) allows you to hike to the highest point in the park. History Human presence in the area goes back to circa 1100-1450 A.D., the \\"classic period\\" of Hohokam history, consisting of rockpile fields located on large portions of the area. These are recognized as a sign of agricultural activity by the Hohokam, who most likely farmed agaves, yuccas, and chollas. With a few exceptions, the entire area was largely undeveloped before 1975. Those exceptions include minor prospecting, some cattle grazing, and a stagecoach trail. In 1948 two prospectors, Mansel Carter and Marion Kennedy moved into the area. Carter was originally from Ohio, and after several different careers in his younger years which included piloting and logging, he moved to Gilbert in 1941, where he opened a camera shop. Kennedy was an American Indian from Oklahoma, where he attended the Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with Jim Thorpe. Initially they lived in a cave near the foot of Goldmine Mountain, prior to building a shanty outside the cave. The two made their living by mining small claims in the area, finding copper, silver, turquoise, and gold. Over the next dozen years they used the proceeds of their mining to file 55 claims, which are still owned by Carter's heirs. Kennedy died in 1960 at the age of 86. After his death, Carter continued to mine, but also began to whittle figurines out of local wood and cactus skeletons. Nicknamed the \\"Old Man of the Mountain\\", he died at the age of 85 in 1987. The park was created in 1986, on approximately 6,800 acres owned by the United States Bureau of Land Management. An additional 3,400 acres owned by Maricopa County was incorporated into the park during the 1990s. The park is largely inaccessible due to the lack of improved roads and trails. The surrounding area consists mostly of agricultural fields, desert flats, and low-lying hills. There are also areas where low density housing projects have sprung up. In 2005 a visitor center was constructed.

The goal of the campaign was the capture of Moscow, which, according to the chief of the White Army Anton Denikin, would play a decisive role in the outcome of the Civil War and bring the Whites closer to the final victory. After initial successes, in which the city of Oryol (Orel) at only 360 km from Moscow was taken, Denikin's overextended Army was decisively defeated in a series of battles in October and November 1919. The Moscow campaign of the AFSR can be divided into two phases: the offensive of the AFSR (July 3 - October 10) and the counteroffensive of the Red Southern Front (October 11 - November 18).  Prelude  By the beginning of July 1919, the situation on the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War was drastically in favor of the White Guards. An important cause of this situation were the anti- Bolshevik uprisings in the territories controlled by the Bolsheviks in reaction against the Red Terror. This meant that in the rear of the Red Army the Soviets only controlled the cities and some concentration areas, while the rest the territory was controlled by numerous rebel Atamans or local self- governments.  Battle  = Moscow directive = After a series of victories in Spring 1919, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the South of Russia, Lieutenant-General Anton Denikin proclaimed Directive No. 08878 (the Moscow Directive) on July 3, 1919 in Tsaritsyn. This directive defined as operational and strategic target of the White Guard armies, to seize Moscow then controlled by the Bolsheviks and the capital of the RSFSR. = Early stage. July‚ÄìAugust 1919 = During July 1919, the AFSR carried out the plan of the Moscow directive and advanced North. From the middle of the month, the Red Army tried to launch some counterattacks. Although these attempts were unsuccessful, they stopped the advance of the White forces to Moscow. The main White successes were achieved in the western and south-western directions. In the west, Poltava was taken on July 31, and In the south-west, Red forces were defeated in Northern Tavria and west of Yekaterinoslav. By the end of July, the troops of the AFSR had reached the line Verkhnodniprovsk - Nikopol - Dnieper River. In the East, General Wrangels Caucasian army took Kamyshin on July 28 and advanced to the north, while the Cossack division of the Caucasian army crossed the Volga, creating an extensive bridgehead in the Tsaritsyn area. At the same time, the Don Army was not able to advance and was even forced to withdraw to the Don after fierce fighting, losing Liski and Balashov. The historian Alexander Nemirovsky writes that the offensive operations of the AFSR in July were developing intensely but slowly, nothing like the rapid advance observed in June. The reasons for this, in his opinion, was the continuous flow of reinforcements into the Red Army, far exceeding the number of reinforcements for the White Army. The second half of July had been very difficult for the Eastern front of the AFSR, and in fact showed the futility of a further advance in the direction of the Tambov - Saratov line. = Corrected directive. August‚ÄìSeptember 1919 = The events of the first decade of August 1919 are determined by Denikin's stubborn desire to fulfill the first part of the Moscow directive (taking Balashov and Saratov). But all attempts of the Don and the Caucasian armies to advance eastwards of the Don were thwarted. In the west, the Volunteer Army pursued the enemy defeated in July without much resistance, and reached the Hadiach - Kremenchuk - Znamianka - Yelisavetgrad line on 11 August. It was discovered that the combat capability of the western part of the Southern Front of the Red Army was unexpectedly low. This led to the correction of Denikin's combat plan: without formally canceling the previous tasks of the Moscow Directive in the east, Denikin proclaimed on August 12 a new Directive, ordering the Volunteer Army and the 3rd Separate Corps to immediately launch a general offensive towards the west, regardless of the situation on other sectors of the front. A special Kiev Group under General Bredov was created to attack Kiev. A. Nemirovsky writes that the main goal of Denikin in this period was still to provide a wide, straightened front for subsequent actions on Moscow, only this time with an extension to the west. The construction of such a front was further facilitated by the good prospect of connecting with the Poles and creating a common anti-Bolshevik front with them. On August 18, the Bolshevik front in Ukraine collapsed and the Red forces this region, the 12th army were surrounded. On August 23‚Äì24, the AFSR took Odessa and on August 31 captured Kiev. By mid-August, the Soviet troops in the central Chernozem Region launched a counter offensive. The breakthrough of the Reds was stopped by the end of August. The Red Army Selivachev Group suffered a complete defeat and retreated under the general onslaught of the AFSR to their original positions. The Caucasian army also defeated a Bolshevik attack on Tsaritsyn, and at the same time, the Don Army crossed the Don and pushed back the Bolsheviks towards the Khopyor River. = General offensive. September‚ÄìOctober 1919 = The complete failure of the Bolshevik August offensive by the middle of September prompted Denikin to issue a new directive to launch a general offensive by all AFSR forces. A. Nemirovsky writes that now the implementation of the Moscow directive as such should have begun: the broad front necessary for this, combined with the initiative in the hands of the AFSR, was finally available. The offensive was to be carried out along the shortest, central route and take place in two stages: first reaching the line (Dnieper - in cooperation with the Poles) - Bryansk - Oryol - Yelets and from there the concentric attack on Moscow. At the Don and around Tsaritsyn the strategy was to defend. During September 12 - October 19, Denikin's plan was carried out with exceptional success. The Southern Red seemed to be falling apart. In particular, the first two weeks of the offensive (September 12‚Äì24) were a genuine triumph for the AFSR, which met with practically no serious resistance. On September 17, Sumy, Oboyan, and Stary Oskol fell in the central direction, on September 20‚Äì21 the Volunteers captured Kursk, and Fatezh and Rylsk fell on September 24. The Bolsheviks were close to disaster and were preparing to go underground. An underground Moscow party committee was created, government agencies began evacuating to Vologda. On September 27, the Southern Front was split into the Southern and South-Eastern Front. On October 5‚Äì8, the Komsomol announced the mobilization for the Southern Front at the II Congress of the RKSM. = The collapse of the general offensive. October‚ÄìDecember 1919. = But by mid- October, the position of the White armies has noticeably deteriorated. In the rear of the AFSR, the Black Army of Nestor Makhno won the Battle of Peregonovka and advanced some 600 km through the Uman region towards Taganrog, the base of Denikin's headquarters. This forced Denikin to send some of his best troops to the South to parry Makhno's Army, which was also blocking his supply lines. To make matters worse, the Bolsheviks were able to conclude an armistice with Poland and the Ukrainian People's Army, freeing up forces to fight the White Army. Denikin had refused to recognize Poland's and Ukraine's independence, thus destroying any possibility of an alliance against the Reds. On October 11, numerically superior Red Army forces (62,000 men against 22,000 for the Whites), reinforced by Latvian, Estonian and Chinese national units, launched an offensive in the Oryol-Kursk sector. Initially, the Whites held their ground in unusually fierce battles, and by 20 October the Volunteers occupied the Novhorod-Siverskyi - Dmitrovsk - Oryol - Novosil line south of Yelets. But by this time, their offensive was halted everywhere. By the end of October, the Volunteer Army was defeated in fierce battles south of Oryol by the troops of the Southern Front of the Red Army under command of Alexander Yegorov, and then began to retreat all along the front line. In the winter of 1919-1920, Denikins troops were pushed back all the way to the Black Sea.

The state has extensive oil and gas, sand and gravel, coal, groundwater and other natural resources. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics North Dakota is underlain by Precambrian crystalline basement rock, although these rocks are less well understood than in neighboring states. In the Proterozoic, a mountain range known as the Western Dakota Mobile Belt formed between two billion and 1.8 billion years ago in connection with the Trans-Hudson orogeny, stretching north into Manitoba and Saskatchewan before eroding almost entirely 1.5 billion years ago, shedding sediments now found in the Montana Belt Supergroup. Commonly glacial erratic boulders are Precambrian rocks transported to the region by ice sheets. =Paleozoic (541‚Äì251 million years ago)= In the Cambrian at the beginning of the Paleozoic, North Dakota was located at the equator. Extensive deposition of sedimentary rocks began 515 million years ago, when the Canadian Shield and North Dakota flooded during a marine transgression forming the Sauk Sequence. The sequence contains only one major unit‚Äîthe Deadwood Formation. The area of the Nesson Anticline and some hills eroded out of the rugged Precambrian landscape likely remained above the water surface. The sequence begins with sandstone eroded from Precambrian rocks and ascends through limestone and shale, before returning to sandstone when sea levels dropped again. Conodont fossils are common in the Deadwood Formation. During a dryland period, for 15 to 20 million years the land surface was eroded and no rocks from 485 to 470 million years ago are found in the rock record. A renewed marine transgression began the Tippecanoe Sequence, including Winnipeg Group sandstone and shale, overlain by Red River, Stony Mountain, Stonewall and Interlake Formation carbonates. In total, the Tippecanoe Sequence is 2000 feet thick. During the Silurian, the Williston Basin subsided becoming a defined feature. Percolating groundwater eroded limestone into caves and hollows typical of a karst topography during a mid-Paleozoic dry period, before a return to a shallow sea in the Ordovician. The region was above sea level for 40 million years during the Devonian as streams eroded the land surface until sea levels rose 356 million years ago. A weathered paleosol (known as the Ashern Formation) at the top of the Interlake Formation indicates that the Devonian and Mississippian Kaskaskia Sequence eroded the carbonates of the Interlake Formation. Winnipegosis Formation limestone and dolomite formed on top of the Ashern Formation, ascending to sandstone and shale in the Souris River and Dawson Bay formations. Periodically, the area dried out, resulting in weathered paleosols and the red and green siltstone layers of the Three Forks Formation which cover the Birdbear Formation carbonates. The collision of North America and Europe as Pangea began to form kicked off the Caledonian orogeny and realigned the Williston Basin opening to the sea in the west rather than the north. During the maximum extent of the sea, the Lodgepole and Mission Canyon formations took shape. A dry period precipitated Charles Formation evaporites, followed by Big Snowy Group carbonates, sand and shale. The ancestral Rocky Mountains began to rise around this time, bringing the Otter Formation shales and then draining the sea and uplifting the land. After a 10 million year dry period, shallow water crept back in during the Pennsylvanian beginning the Absaroka Sequence with Tyler Formation sandstone and shale, overlain by carbonates and brown clastic rocks in the Amsden Formation and Broom Creek Formation sandy carbonates. Another 10 million years of erosion is marked by an unconformity. Through the Permian, salt and red bed formations filled the Williston Basin belonging to the Opeche and Spearfish formations, along with the Minnekahta Formation limestone. =Mesozoic (251‚Äì66 million years ago)= In the Triassic, at the beginning of the Mesozoic, a meteorite struck McKenzie County, rearranging older sediments. Some salt and gypsum remains from the time period, indicative of the vast deserts that covered Pangea at the time. An unconformity wipes out 45 million years of the early Jurassic before the beginning of the Zuni Sequence. North Dakota was a low forested landscape experiencing ongoing erosion. Rivers and streams moving across the eroded Jurassic landscape deposited the sandstone and siltstone Inyan Kara Formation. Thick layers of shale, such as the Pierre Formation, formed in the Western Interior Seaway during a major global marine transgression in the Cretaceous. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago‚Äìpresent)= In the early Cenozoic, uplift and erosion of the Rocky Mountains with the continuation of the Laramide orogeny dumped sediment into the Williston Basin, creating the sandstone and shale of the Ludlow Formation, Cannonball Formation and Slope Formation together with a final marine transgression into North Dakota from 65 to 55 million years ago. The Bullion Creek Formation and the Sentinel Butte Formation covered over these units with lignite coal. They outcrop in the west and contain most of the state's coal reserves (although the single most productive unit is the Sentinel Butte Formation). Coal formation took place in a coastal swamp environment akin to large coastal marshes that exist currently in the Holocene along the US Atlantic coast. Even as Bullion Creek sediments were being deposited in the center of the state, swamps to the west were filling and covering them over with Sentinel Butte material. From 50 to 60 million years ago in the Paleocene and Eocene the clay and sand units of the Golden Valley Formation deposited in lakes and streams and lie above Sentinel Butte units in some locations in the west. During the Eocene, mammals and grasses diversified in the area as North Dakota transitioned from a warm temperate to subtropical climate. With long running dryland conditions, North Dakota has gone through a period of extensive weathering that continues in the modern period, often producing unconsolidated sediments rather than rocks. The Tejas Sequence began to form in the Oligocene, starting off with conglomerate, siltstone, clay, volcanic ash, freshwater limestone and sands of the White River Group. Widespread volcanism to the west deposited volcanic ash in Miocene and Pliocene lake beds, which now forms the peaks of the Killdeer Mountains. From around 35 million years ago, large quantities of gravel and sand from the Absaroka Mountains, Big Horn Mountains and Black Hills deposited in western North Dakota and up to 400 feet of limestone plated the bottom of a lake that remains as the Killdeer Mountains. Estimates suggest several thousand cubic miles of sediment were eroded from five million years ago until three million years ago. Evidence of the erosion is found in the Turtle Mountains, which were originally part of a continuous plateau before up to 600 feet of sandstone and shale eroded between the two features prior to glaciation. Pliocene erosion created the Red River Valley, as a tributary of the Cheyenne River eroded a gently sloping escarpment 1000 feet down (the ground surface of the valley is higher, due to glacial and lake bed sediments). The Killdeer Mountains are up to 1300 feet above the Little Missouri River, leading to inferences about the previous height of the plain. The state was glaciated six to seven times during the Pleistocene, contributing to erosion and rechanneling rivers. During the last 11,000 years of the Holocene, an initial warm period led to widespread sagebrush grasslands around 7000 years ago with large dunes formed at Wyndmere, Walhalla and Denbigh. This gave way to a wetter period with more widespread forests. Devils Lake and Stump Lake have periodically dried up or fluctuated in response to climate changes. In the 1800s, when European settlers arrived in large numbers, Stump Lake contained the stumps of trees that had grown on dryland in the 1300s. Hydrogeology The water table in North Dakota ranges between 15 and 50 feet deep, or 100 feet in upland areas. Fully wet areas are recognized in drill cores by unoxidized dark material. The lignite and sandstone of the Fort Union Group in the west is the top groundwater unit and a common source of water for farms and ranches. The western two-thirds of the state is underlain by an extensive sandstone aquifer, mainly in the Fox Hills Formation and the lower Hell Creek Formation. Although it is close to the surface in the east, it slopes to up to 2000 feet below the ground surface in south-central North Dakota. Below this unit is fine-grained Cretaceous shale and sandstone that produce almost no water. The underlying Kara Formation limestones are beneath almost the entire state. Known as the Dakota aquifer, it is commonly tapped for artesian wells. Very few wells were drilled in the aquifer before 1900, although one at Elledale in 1886 went down 1087 feet and produced up to 700 gallons a minute with a pressure reaching 176 pounds per square inch. Widespread drilling in the 1910s prompted state requirements for pressure control valves due to a drop in pressure and the drying up of many wells. The water has high salinity but tends to be warm and is preferred in parts of the state for watering cattle in the winter. It is frequently used for oil-field operations and waste brine is injected back into the aquifer. Thick Jurassic and Triassic separates the Dakota aquifer from the deepest Paleozoic limestone aquifer underlying most of the state. Natural resource geology The Williston Basin produces most of North Dakota's oil and gas, particularly since the boom in hydraulic fracturing after 2006. The Bakken Formation is particularly productive and underlies all but the southwest corner of the basin. Bowman County in the southwest has structurally controlled fields in Ordovician formations. Between the north of the Little Missouri River and the Burke County line is the Nesson Anticline, one of the largest geologic features in the state. Limestone to the northeast and east of the anticline in Bottineau, Burke and Renville counties, oil and gas is trapped by anhydrite infilling or shale and siltstone cap rock in the Triassic Spearfish Formation, over an unconformity. The beach and nearshore sediments of the Tyler Formation, close to Dickinson, North Dakota also house oil, trapped in Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sediments together with a shoreline stream filled with oil-bearing sand, south of Dickinson at Rocky Ridge. In one unusual case, the oil-bearing Red Wing Structure in McKenzie County contains Mississippian strata uplifted 3000 feet higher than neighboring sediments of the same age due to a meteorite impact. Western North Dakota is notable for widespread clinker‚Äîclay, shale and sandstone baked into a material like natural brick by burning coal. Some beds are up to 50 feet thick in the state. Prairie fires periodically light lignite on fire, including one fire that burned near Medora from 1951 until 1977, or over at 30 locations over a 7000-acre area close to Amidon. It is widely used as a road material and as ornamentation for gardens. Iron oxide, calcium carbonate and silica concretions frequently form nodules and concretions in the west, including siderite ironstone and petrified logs. Two-thirds of the west of the state are underlain by lignite, which was mined for fuel by Native Americans and by American explorers, Lewis and Clark. Before 1902, mining was done by hand limited by more than 10 feet of overburden. However, the introduction of heavy equipment increased mining efforts. In areas, old mine shafts have collapsed, pitting the overlying landscape. After peaking at 320 mines in 1940 after 21 years of heavy machinery mining, the number of mines began to drop. The number of mines dropped to 100 in 1950 and only 38 by 1965. During the 1970s, new large power plants opened adjacent to Lake Sakakawea and together with a gasification project at North American Coal Company's Beulah plant, helped to drive new demand. Weathering and oxidation of lignite produces leonardite which is used as a dispersant and a control on viscosity for oil wells. Peat, concentrated in areas like the Souris River in McHenry County is used in gardens, but not widely produced, and the state has up to 100,000 tons of reserves. Fine sand is common, suitable for foundries as well as mortar and plaster. Both sand and gravel are most common in the formerly glaciated parts of the state northeast of the Missouri River where beach deposits formed after the ice sheets melted. Shale is common in the western Red River Valley and appears frequently in glacial till. Point bars in rivers and glacial kame deposits are also important sources of sand and gravel. Large outwash plains are found in Nelson, Eddy, Benson, Logan, Ransom and Sheridan counties. In 1955, ore grade uranium was found in lignite between Belfield and Amidon in southeast Billings County. Uranium dissolved from enriched ash and percolated upward into the coal. Only a few hundred tons were ever extracted and ended in 1967 due to difficulty milling lignite compared with sandstone deposits in the Colorado Plateau. North Dakota has up to 1700 cubic miles of halite salt deposits below ground discovered during oil drilling. Gold, volcanic ash, quartzite, clay and sulfur are also resources.

It is classified as a luminous blue variable and is one of the most luminous stars in the LMC. History of observations R71 has long been known as a blue supergiant and one of the brightest stars in the Magellanic Clouds. It was given a spectral type of B2.5 Iep. By 1974, R71 had increased in brightness from about 11th magnitude to about magnitude 9.2, and examination of historical photographic plates showed that there had been similar changes in the past, with the brightness peaking around 1914 and 1939. The increases in visual magnitude were accompanied by reddening, apparent cooling of the star. Such outbursts of 1‚Äì1.5 magnitudes from blue supergiants accompanied by cooling of several thousand kelvin, such that the bolometric luminosity remained approximately constant, were considered characteristic of a class of variables then known as S Doradus variables, now called luminous blue variables. The outburst of R71 lasted from about 1971 until 1977, and it then faded back to about 11th magnitude. Records are incomplete, but a new outburst was observed to begin in 2006 with the brightness increasing beyond any previous observations to magnitude 8.7. The temperature also cooled to record levels around 6,650 K and the luminosity was calculated to have increased significantly. During the rise of this outburst, periodic brightness variations with an amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes began to be seen. Spectrum The spectrum of R71 in quiescence (minimum brightness) shows weak emission lines of HŒ± and HŒ≤ and absorption lines for the rest of the Balmer series. There are many strong forbidden emission lines, especially of ionised iron. The spectrum is readily classified as a B class supergiant, the peculiarities such as emission and forbidden lines not unusual for the most luminous stars. During the 1970s outburst, many spectral lines developed strong P Cygni profiles, while the forbidden emission lines weakened and eventually disappeared. Many other metal absorption lines appeared and the spectrum was clearly of a cooler A-class star. In 2012, at the peak of the unusually bright outburst, the HŒ± lines developed into double-peaked emission lines and eventually to inverted P Cygni profiles. HŒ≤ shows much weaker emission wings to the inverted P Cygni profiles, and other hydrogen lines show no emission. Helium spectral lines disappeared completely, suggesting much cooler temperatures. Absorption lines of metals dominate the visual spectrum, again indicating cool temperatures. A particularly unusual feature is the near-infrared forbidden emission lines of ionised calcium usually only seen in warm hypergiants, but also known from Œ∑ Carinae during its great eruption. The spectral class is estimated to be as late as F9 to G1 during this outburst. Variability R71 show brightness variations in many ways typical of the luminous blue variable group of variable stars: long periods near a minimum brightness known as quiescence; micro-variations of less than 0.1 magnitude during the quiescent periods; and outbursts of a magnitude or more lasting several years at intervals of a few decades. At quiescence the star is around magnitude 11, with the lowest brightness recorded at about magnitude 11.2. The 1914, 1939, and 1970s outbursts reached approximately magnitudes 10.2, 9.9, and 9.8 respectively. The outbursts of R71 have apparently been getting progressively brighter, albeit from only a handful observed, with the 2012 outburst being unusually bright for this class of variables, reaching a peak of magnitude 8.7. It is also unusual in that periodic variations of about 0.2 magnitudes developed during the rise to maximum brightness. The period of these variations increased as the brightness increased until it was around 425 days. Properties H-R Diagram showing the location of the luminous blue variables and their typical behaviour during an outburst. R71 is one of the most luminous stars known, and the most luminous in the Magellanic Clouds during the 2012 outburst. During quiescence, it appears as like other very luminous early B supergiants, about 15,000 K and . The radius of this type of stars is not well-defined as it has a dense stellar wind and is losing mass at about every three million years. The standard definition of a stellar surface at optical depth of 2/3 gives a radius of , but a more realistic definition of the surface for this type of star is at optical depth of 20 which gives a radius of . During an outburst, R71 cools and expands although the bolometric luminosity does not change greatly, which is typical behaviour for a luminous blue variable. Because of the cooler temperature, more of the electromagnetic radiation is emitted at visual wavelengths and the visual brightness increases. During the abnormal 2012 outburst, the star cooled beyond the typical luminous blue variable minimum temperature of about 8,500 K, reaching something like 6,650 K and the radius increased about five times to around . The luminosity apparently also increased to over , something which has been seen in other LBVs but is thought to be unusual. This is likely to be beyond than the empirical Humphreys‚ÄìDavidson limit at which stars become unstable because of their high luminosity. The brightness variations shown during the unusually cool outburst may be related to those shown by Cepheid variables and RV Tauri variables. The particularly low temperature brings R71 close to the instability strip where temperature-related opacity changes in the atmosphere cause regular pulsations. Evolution Luminous blue variables have traditionally been considered to be in a short-lived unstable transition state before a massive star becomes a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star. This has been challenged by the theory that LBVs are the result of binary mass transfer with the mass gaining star becoming a massive and unstable luminous blue variable. R71 appears to be a very massive star that did not form within a mass star cluster, making it likely that it did not initially form as a very massive star. Instead it may have become massive later by gaining mass from a companion. For either formation method, the next stage of evolution for R71 is likely to be a hydrogen-free Wolf-Rayet star. Eventually it is inevitable that its core will collapse, which may result in a supernova. However, a proportion of stars similar to R71 appear to undergo progressively more violent outbursts until they are destroyed. Also, some or all Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars may collapse directly to a black hole without producing a bright supernova explosion.

Completed in 1942, the boat was briefly assigned to Norway in early 1943 before she was transferred to France in July. T24 was unsuccessfully attacked by Allied motor torpedo boats and aircraft during her voyage down the English Channel and then came to the aid of a convoy being attacked by Allied destroyers. Later that year she escorted blockade runners and Axis submarines through the Bay of Biscay. The boat played a minor role in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay and was lightly damaged during the Action of 26 April 1944. During the subsequent battle, T24 sank a Canadian destroyer and was damaged when she later struck a mine. She played a minor role in the Battle of Ushant in June and was then damaged defending a convoy in August in the Bay of Biscay. T24 was sunk off the French coast later that month by Allied fighter-bombers. Design and description The Type 39 torpedo boat was conceived as a general-purpose design, much larger than preceding German torpedo boats.Whitley 1991, p. 52 The boats had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of , a draft of at deep load and displaced at standard load and at deep load.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 Their crew numbered 206 officers and sailors.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 239 The Type 39s were fitted with a pair of geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, using steam from four high-pressure water- tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce which was intended give the ships a maximum speed of . They carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Whitley 1991, pp. 54, 203 As built, the Type 39 ships mounted four SK C/32 guns in single mounts protected by gun shields; one forward of the superstructure, one between the funnels, and two aft, one superfiring over the other. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel, six C/38 guns in one quadruple mount on the aft superstructure and a pair of single mounts on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti- submarine work the boats were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1944 the single 2 cm mounts in the bridge wings were replaced by quadruple mounts and FuMB7 \\"Naxos\\" and FuMB8 \\"Wanz G\\" radar detectors were installed.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career Originally ordered as a Type 37 torpedo boat on 30 March 1939, T24 was reordered on 10 November 1939 from Schichau. The boat was laid down on 21 September 1940 at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1483, launched on 13 September 1941 and commissioned on 17 October 1942. After working up until March 1943, she was briefly deployed to Norway for escort duties before returning to Germany for a brief refit at Kiel. On 3 July T24 and her sister departed for Western France, via the English Channel. On the morning of 5 July, the sisters were unsuccessfully attacked by three Dutch-manned motor torpedo boats and shelled by British coastal artillery. After reaching Boulogne harbor, they were attacked by Hawker Typhoon fighters on 6 July which were equally unsuccessful. The boats sailed shortly after midnight on 7 July, bound for Le Havre where they arrived without being attacked. On the night of 9/10 July, on passage between Saint-Malo and Brest, they were tasked to provide distant cover for a convoy that was escorted by five minesweepers off Ushant. The convoy was attacked by the British destroyers , and the Norwegian-manned which sank one of the minesweepers and damaged another before T24 and T25 could arrive. The sisters heavily damaged Melbreak before the Allied ships disengaged. Now assigned to the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the torpedo boats were tasked to help escort U-boats through the Bay. On 2 August T24, T25 and their sister , responding to a distress call from another submarine, rescued survivors from the submarine . From 29 to 31 August, the same three boats escorted the through the Bay to Lorient.Hervieux, p. 96; Rohwer, pp. 256‚Äì257, 259, 269; Whitley 1991, pp. 144‚Äì145, 212 =Battle of the Bay of Biscay= Alsterufer burning after a RAF attack On 24‚Äì26 December T24 was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay.Whitley 1991, p. 149 Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla and the six torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, pp. 294‚Äì295; Whitley 1991, p. 149 Map of the Battle of Biscay The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw spray over their forward guns which made them difficult to operate. In addition the spray severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. About that time, the destroyers began firing back with guns and torpedoes; the latter all missed and one hit was made on Glasgow at 14:05. Kapit√§n zur See Hans Erdmenger, commander of the 8th Flotilla, decided to split his forces and ordered the destroyers , , and T22, T25 and T26 to reverse course to the north at 14:18. The cruisers pursued the northern group and sank Z27, T25 and T26. All of the ships in the southern group, including T24, were able to successfully disengage.Hervieux, p. 98; Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley 1991, pp. 149‚Äì153 =Subsequent activities= On the night of 21/22 April 1944, the 4th Flotilla, now consisting of T24 and her sisters and , transferred from Cherbourg to Saint-Malo. After laying a minefield off the Sept-√éles on the north coast of Brittany on the night of 25/26 April, the flotilla was engaged by an Allied force that consisted of the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and off the √éle de Batz. The Allied ships were engaged by German coastal artillery without effect and Korvettenkapit√§n Franz Kohlauf, the flotilla's commander,O'Hara, p. 203 headed west in search of the Allied ships, but the Germans were spotted first by Black Princes radar at a range of at 02:07. They detected the Allied ships shortly afterwards and reversed course. The Allied ships were faster than the torpedo boats and had closed the range to by 02:20 when Black Prince began firing star shells. The destroyers began firing at T24 and T27 at a range of as Black Prince hung back in support until one of her forward turrets jammed. The Allied fire was accurate and one shell struck T27 at 02:31 and reduced her speed to ; Kohlauf ordered her into Morlaix Bay and the Allies lost her radar reflection amongst the rocks of the bay. T24 had fruitlessly fired her aft torpedo tubes at her pursuers and was then hit by two shells in her superstructure that started fires that were quickly doused. She fired her remaining torpedoes to no effect at 02:54 and, about that same time, a shell disabled T29s rudder. Ashanti and Huron concentrated on T29 while Haida and Athabaskan continued their pursuit of T24. They disengaged before T24 reached Saint-Malo, and returned to help sink T29.Hervieux, p. 99; Rohwer, pp. 317‚Äì318; Whitley 1991, pp. 156‚Äì157 After emergency repairs, T27 joined T24 in Saint-Malo during the night of 26/27 April. The sisters departed Saint-Malo bound for Brest on the night of 28/29 April and were spotted by British coastal radar. They were intercepted by Haida and Athabaskan off √éle Vierge. Haida opened the engagement by firing a star shell at 04:12; the Germans laid a smoke screen in response and turned away. The sisters fired all of their torpedoes as they turned, T24 firing three off the wrong side of the boat, but one of the others hit Athabaskan. Shortly afterwards, she blew up, probably from a magazine explosion, and sank at 04:42. Haida pursued T27, badly damaging her. While maneuvering, T27 accidentally ran aground and the Canadian destroyer continued to engage until she started a large fire and then returned to the site where Athabaskan had sunk to rescue survivors. T24 and a pair of minesweepers failed in their attempt to pull T27 off and then T24 rescued 47 survivors from Athabaskan on the way to Brest. She struck a mine en route, but was only damaged. The 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla was then disbanded and the boat was assigned to the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. After repairs, T24 was ordered to Cherbourg on 19 May, but struck another mine and was under repair for the next several weeks.Hervieux, p. 100; Rohwer, pp. 318, 324; Whitley 1991, pp. 157, 159 On the night of 8/9 June, the four ships of the 8th Flotilla set out from Brest for Cherbourg, but were intercepted by eight Allied destroyers of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla in the Battle of Ushant. The German ships had been spotted first and the British opened fire, with the Germans responding with a four-torpedo salvo from each destroyer that missed when the Allied ships turned to evade them; T24, the trailing ship in the formation, did not fire because she had no visible targets. The British fire was extremely effective, with , immediately ahead of the torpedo boat, badly damaged only moments after firing her first salvo. The range was so close that both sides engaged with their or 3.7 cm anti-aircraft guns which appreciably added to the damaged suffered by Z24. The Allied ships hit the German destroyer five times before she was able to lay smoke and disengage, followed by T24. Haida and Huron pursued the pair until they passed over a British minefield and lost track of the German ships after the Canadian ships were forced to detour around it. After Haida and Huron broke off their pursuit, Z24 and T24 reversed course after hearing from the flotilla commander until they could see star shells bursting on the horizon and then Z24s captain received permission to return to Brest.Hervieux, p. 100; Rohwer, p. 332; Whitley 1991, pp. 158‚Äì161 T24 (foreground) and Z24 under attack, 25 August On the night of 14/15 August, T24, two minesweepers and Sperrbrecher 157 were escorting the aircraft repair ship Richthofen when they were attacked by the light cruiser and the destroyers and off Les Sables d'Olonne. The torpedo boat laid a smoke screen and near missed Iroquois with her torpedoes. She was hit once by Iroquois, but the Allied ships sank Sperrbrecher 157, set Richthofen on fire, badly damaged one minesweeper and forced the other one to beach herself. Iroquois was lightly damaged during the attack. Off Le Verdon-sur-Mer on 24 August, T24 and Z24 were attacked by rocket-firing Bristol Beaufighter fighter-bombers from No. 236 Squadron RAF and No. 404 Squadron RCAF. They sank T24 with the loss of 18 dead at and so severely damaged Z24 that she foundered the following day. The squadrons lost 17 aircraft to all causes during the attack.Gr√∂ner, p. 195; Hervieux, p. 100; Rohwer, p. 347; Whitley 1991, pp. 162‚Äì163 Notes Citations References     External links * T24 at german navy.de Category:Ships built by Schichau Category:Ships built in Elbing Category:Type 39 torpedo boats Category:Maritime incidents in August 1944 Category:1941 ships Category:Torpedo boats sunk by aircraft ","title":"German torpedo boat T24"},{"id":"58675538","text":"The 1905 Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship was the 17th staging of the Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Kilkenny County Board.

Anti- aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel, six C/38 guns in one quadruple mount on the aft superstructure and a pair of single mounts on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work the boats were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and various FumB radar detectors were installed late in the war.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career Originally ordered as a Type 37 torpedo boat on 30 March 1939, T29 was reordered on 10 November 1939 from Schichau. She was laid down at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1488, and commissioned on 21 August 1943. After working up, T29 and her sister arrived in Western France during late January 1944. En route the two torpedo boats were shelled by British coastal artillery and attacked by a pair of British Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers that caused some minor damage to T28.Whitley 1991, pp. 156, 212 =Action of 26 April 1944= On the night of 21/22 April 1944, the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, now consisting of T29 and her sisters and , transferred from Cherbourg to Saint-Malo. After laying a minefield off the Sept-√éles on the north coast of Brittany on the night of 25/26 April, the flotilla was engaged by an Allied force that consisted of the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and off the √éle de Batz. The Allied ships were engaged by German coastal artillery without effect and Franz Kohlauf headed west in search of the Allied ships, but the Germans were spotted first by Black Princes radar at a range of at 02:07. They detected the Allied ships shortly afterwards and reversed course. The Allied ships were faster than the torpedo boats and had closed the range to by 02:20 when Black Prince began firing star shells. The destroyers began firing at T24 and T27 at a range of as Black Prince hung back in support until one of her forward turrets jammed. The Allied fire was accurate and one shell struck T27 at 02:31 and reduced her speed to ; Kohlauf ordered her into Morlaix Bay and the Allies lost her radar reflection among the rocks of the bay. T24 had fruitlessly fired her aft torpedo tubes at her pursuers and was then hit by two shells in her superstructure that started fires that were quickly doused. She fired her remaining torpedoes to no effect at 02:54 and, about that same time, a shell disabled T29s rudder. Ashanti and Huron concentrated on T29, initially hitting her stern which caused her to veer off-course, while Haida and Athabaskan continued their pursuit of T24.Hervieux, p. 99; Rohwer, pp. 317‚Äì318; Whitley, pp. 156‚Äì157 Ashanti and Huron hit their target repeatedly at close range; these hits set T29 on fire, caused a explosion and blew the forward torpedo mount overboard. Haida and Athabaskan were unable to catch T24 and returned to help sink T29, but were initially unable to do so despite firing 15 torpedoes. The destroyers paused to allow the surviving crew to abandon ship around 04:00. When they moved in to recover survivors, a single 2 cm gun opened fire and damaged Huron and Haida.

Education as a lawyer and the beginning of his political career  Manuel Romero Rubio began his education at the Conciliar Seminary in Mexico City, where he acquired knowledge of Latin grammar and philosophy. Later, at the Colegio de San Gregorio he began his studies in law. In there, he was recognized as one of the most distinguished students and became friends with Lerdo de Tejada, among other colleagues who later acquired highly relevant roles in the national political sphere. At the Colegio de San Gregorio, due to his brilliant participation in the discussions of the Academy of Jurisprudence, Romero Rubio received various offers to occupy positions in the government; however, he did not accept these invitations, preferring to finish his studies. The Colegio de San Gregorio ‚Äìconsidered as a center of independent thought‚Äì, underwent government scrutiny and was closed briefly under the return of Santa Anna on October 20, 1853. For this reason, Manuel Romero Rubio and Ignacio Mariscal, among other students, became the main organizers of the Club Pol√≠tico el √Åguila, which emerged as a protest, and which was joined by several figures who later occupied high positions in Mexican politics. On January 11, 1854, Romero Rubio obtained his law degree from the Colegio de San Gregorio, and enrolled before the National Association Bar with the financial support of Jos√© Urbano Fonseca Mart√≠nez. That same year, he opened his own law firm, which was one of the most prominent in the capital, and attended by figures from various political positions.  Participation in the Plan of Ayutla  In 1854, being 26 years old, Manuel Romero Rubio joined the Plan of Ayutla, aimed at removing conservative, centralist President Santa Anna government and, with Miguel Buenrostro, he held a first meeting with Benito Ju√°rez as the representative of the Liberal clubs in Mexico City. After the triumph of the Plan of Ayutla, Romero Rubio was appointed magistrate of the first instance in the court of Tulancingo, Hidalgo. Two months later, he declined the position and returned to the capital to serve as secretary of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and, later, as advisor to Colonel Agust√≠n Alcerreca, governor of the Federal District.  Romero Rubio Constituent and the Reform War  After Santa Anna's resignation in 1855 by the Ayutla Revolution, the Constituent Congress of 1856-1857 was established, where Manuel Romero Rubio ‚Äì without having proposed a candidacy ‚Äì was elected alternate deputy by the State of Mexico thanks to his excellent reputation as a magistrate in the Tulancingo court. As member of the Constituent Congress, his votes in favor of the confiscation of the assets of the clergy, and the dissolution of the Society of Jesus ‚Äìwhich had been reestablished in Mexico during the dictatorship of Santa Anna‚Äì are specially relevant. His interventions in the Constituent Congress positioned Romero Rubio as a liberal politician and, in September 1857, he held the position of Secretary of the Interior of the Federal District during the government of Ignacio Comonfort. However, in December 1857 he resigned his position due to the addition of Juan Jos√© Baz ‚ÄìGovernor of the Federal District‚Äì to the Plan of Tacubaya; whose main objective was to reject the Constitution of 1857. At the end of March 1858, the new conservative government of F√©lix Mar√≠a Zuloaga apprehended Romero Rubio, Riva Palacio and other liberals who were transferred to the dungeons of the ex-Acordada, from where they corresponded with their allies, to stay informed about the events of the Reform War. On November 20, 1858, when he was released along with the rest of the ex-Accorda political prisoners, Manuel Romero Rubio was appointed head of the Huastecas forces of the liberal army, and joined the front of General Juan J. de la Garza in Tamaulipas, who named him second in command of his division. However, Romero Rubio remained at the head of the division when De la Garza was wounded after a confrontation with conservative forces in Corcovada; moment when Manuel Romero Rubio directed his troops to San Luis Potos√≠, where he met with other liberal leaders and was commissioned to meet with Benito Ju√°rez in Veracruz, with the purpose of convincing him about the great need to speed up the declaration of the Reform Laws, whose project had been postponed due to the country's political instability. Finally, in July 1859, Ju√°rez announced the Reform Laws, and Romero Rubio returned to Tamaulipas, from where he organized his division to confront conservative groups that opposed the new Constitution.  Participation in the government of Benito Ju√°rez  Romero Rubio was involved in the Battle of Calpulapan, the last military confrontation of the Reform War. With the victory of the liberal army in the Reform War, Benito Ju√°rez established his government in Mexico City, and Romero Rubio was appointed to reorganize custom clearance and the government of the Federal District; later he served as president of the Congress and representative deputy of the State of Mexico.  The French intervention and his support for Ju√°rez  During the French intervention in 1863, Ju√°rez left Mexico City leaving General de la Garza in charge of the organization of the military affairs of the capital, and Romero Rubio of the civil affairs. In July of that year, Manuel Romero Rubio was briefly imprisoned in the capital and later fled to Tula, Tamaulipas. The political instability generated by the French intervention caused fractures in the liberal groups, and Romero Rubio joined Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Ortega, who questioned the excessive extension of Ju√°rez's mandate; however, these disagreements did not prevent Manuel Romero Rubio from supporting Ju√°rez during the war against Maximiliano de Habsburgo, gathering in 1867 a significant amount of economic resources to finance his army.  The restored Republic: collaboration with the Ju√°rez government  At the conclusion of the Reform War and despite its victory, the liberal party was divided. Ju√°rez's intentions to extend his mandate further distanced the liberal groups and three main factions emerged: the Juaristas who supported the presidency of Benito Ju√°rez, the Porfiristas who were on the side of Porfirio D√≠az, and the Lerdistas who opted for leadership by Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada. In this context, the figure of Manuel Romero Rubio stood out for his ability to negotiate, and became a reference of intellectual and political unit. Despite belonging to the Lerdistas group, with the Juaristas victory in the elections of 1867, Romero Rubio was named President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1870, and his house was consolidated as one of the most important political meeting places of the time. During the Ju√°rez government, Romero Rubio was also named Supernumerary Magistrate of the Supreme Court, and deputy of the Chihuahua state.  Collaboration with the government of Lerdo de Tejada  In 1872, when Benito Ju√°rez died, Lerdo de Tejada assumed the presidency initially on an temporary basis and, later, as elected president for the 1872-1876 term. In 1876, Lerdo was declared again elected president by the Legislative Branch and Manuel Romero Rubio was appointed Minister of State and Foreign Relations. However, the reelection of Lerdo de Tejada and the accusations of electoral fraud produced many disagreements that led to the armed uprising of the Porfirista group. On November 21 of 1876, with the military victory of Porfirio D√≠az, Lerdo de Tejada and his cabinet ‚Äìincluding Manuel Romero Rubio and Mariano Escobedo‚Äì went into exile in the U.S.  Political estrangement between Romero Rubio and Lerdo de Tejada  The political rupture between Manuel Romero Rubio and Lerdo de Tejada began to forge before the Lerdismo fall in Mexico, due to the fact that although Romero Rubio had a career and was the main advisor of Lerdo de Tejada, the latter did not grant him an active position in his cabinet until the end, when he was appointed Secretary of Foreign Relations in 1876; that is to say, the same year that the armed uprising broke out to avoid the reelection of Lerdo de Tejada. The popularity of Lerdo de Tejada waned not only before figures like Romero Rubio, but before other political agents who criticized him harshly for not listening neither respecting the ideas of others. Some of the criticisms that Romero Rubio expressed about Lerdo before belonging to the Porfirian government was his obstinacy in only including Juarista‚Äôs politicians in high positions in the public administration, which in his opinion produced the political fissure that allowed the Porfiristas to gain power in the political sphere. In 1877, Romero Rubio returned to Mexico with the intention of negotiating a \\"peaceful campaign in favor of constitutional restoration\\", and landed in Veracruz on June 14, 1878; that is, two months after the U.S. government recognized the Diaz government as legitimate. Upon arriving to Mexico, he publicly declared his estrangement from Lerdo de Tejada.  Romero Rubio and the consolidation of the Porfiriato  Upon the arrival in Mexico of Manuel Romero Rubio in 1878, the government of Porfirio D√≠az had not yet consolidated its national political dominance. To achieve this, D√≠az would need not only the support of his former comrades in arms, but stronger leadership that would ensure his future reelection, and that would integrate the different liberal factions that were in dispute. Manuel Romero Rubio's presence in the country served to unify the different voices of the liberal party, and create a peace agreement that would give stability to the new government, which included not only Romero Rubio among its ranks, but also many other former Lerdist personalities. Romero Rubio was recognized for his extraordinary ability to negotiate, so his adherence to the Porfirian project offered the possibility of legitimizing the government of D√≠az by nullifying one of the main axes of dissent and allowing him a strategic alliance that gave him the backing of a experienced circle of Mexican politicians and intellectuals. This pact between D√≠az and the remnants of the Lerdismo was reflected in 1881 with the marriage between Carmen Romero Rubio Castell√≥ ‚Äìdaughter of Manuel Romero Rubio‚Äì and Porfirio D√≠az.  Secretariat of the Interior: functions and contributions  After the 1884 elections, Romero Rubio was appointed Secretary General of the Interior by General D√≠az; position that he held until his death. The competences of the Secretary of the Interior under the leadership of Manuel Romero Rubio covered a wide range of powers that, due to their enormous social and political weight, were essential for the constitution of the Porfirian hegemony. The core of the functions of the Secretary was to guarantee public tranquility, which implied its participation in various essential issues for the functioning of the state: Monitor compliance with the Constitution. To achieve this, so the Secretary of the Interior maintained powers to request to the Congress of the Union the partial or total suspension of constitutional guarantees in cases of hazard of public peace, as well as the power to promote before the Chamber of deputies law initiatives and constitutional reforms, which allowed in 1887 the reelection of D√≠az. Intermediation in the relations between the capital with the Congress of the Union and the States of Mexico ‚Äì untouched powers throughout the period in which Romero Rubio was in charge of the Secretary of the Interior. Monitoring the legitimacy of the electoral elections, an essential issue to maintain the D√≠az regime. As part of this function, the Secretariat of the Interior was also in charge of the postal service in the management of Romero Rubio, since the establishment of the electoral consensus required good communications between the capital and the States of Mexico. As can be seen, it‚Äôs intermediation between the capital and the federal entities gave this Secretariat an essential role during the Porfiriato regime, which could not have continued without this political consensus. Monitoring of freedom of the press; In this case, the Secretariat also monitored the movements of the press in Mexico, not always in favor of freedom of expression. Coercive instruments. The Secretariat of the Interior had coercive instruments to maintain public tranquility. One of them was the National Guard of the Federal District and the Territory of Baja California; the Rural Police of the Federation ‚Äì originally created to protect the main commercial routes that led to Mexico City. The administration and surveillance of hospitals, public charities, pawnshops, piety mountains, lotteries, prisons, jails, penitentiaries, etc., the care of public health and the prevention of epidemics ‚Äìof utmost importance in the 19th century‚Äì , the administration of \\"theaters and public entertainment\\", among others. As for financial matters, one of the initiatives of Manuel Romero Rubio was the reduction of public spending by this Secretariat, which, despite its immense relevance, received a lower budget than ministries like the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. The success of Manuel Romero Rubio's policies was recognized by his contemporaries, and helped him position himself as a fundamental element within the heterogeneous Porfirian cabinet, thanks to his immense capacity for negotiation and conciliation, becoming for this reason the right hand of Porfirio D√≠az.  Romero Rubio, the Liberal Union and the Scientists  As Minister of the Interior, Manuel Romero Rubio founded the Liberal Union group in 1892 with the aim of consolidating it as a political party, although he never fully became one. The Liberal Union was part of a broader plan that sought to give Diaz's reelection apparently liberal and democratic foundations. With a manifesto written by Justo Sierra, multiple calls for parades and demonstrations in favor of D√≠az, and the creation of Porfirista clubs throughout the country, the Liberal Union managed to successfully attract all kinds of social and political strata that adhered to its cause. With this impressive maneuver, Romero Rubio managed to transform the political environment ‚Äìwhich did not originally favor D√≠az‚Äì, and consolidate him before public opinion as the only figure capable of continuing the progressive project and maintaining the country's stability. The group that headed the Liberal Union formed the basis of what would later become known as the Cient√≠ficos, a select intellectual and political circle close to the power. Manuel Romero Rubio was the leader and protector of the Cient√≠ficos until his death, when he inherited his legacy to his political prot√©g√©, the young Secretary of the Treasury, Jos√© Yves Limantour. Romero Rubio's death occurred on October 3, 1895 in Mexico City and was an event of national importance that shook the country's political class. All public buildings, including la Villa de Guadalupe, dressed in mourning, while schools, social clubs, and businesses closed their doors.

Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel, six C/38 guns in one quadruple mount on the aft superstructure and a pair of single mounts on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti- submarine work the ships were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and various FumB radar detectors were installed late in the war. By early 1945, the 2 cm mounts on the bridge wings and the twin 3.7 cm mounts may have been replaced by single mounts for 3.7 cm guns, either the Flak M42 or the Flak M43, or Bofors guns.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career Originally ordered as a Type 37 torpedo boat on 30 March 1939, T28 was reordered on 10 November 1939 from Schichau. She was laid down on 24 September 1941 at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1487, launched on 8 October 1942 and commissioned on 19 June 1943. After working up, T28 and her sister arrived in Western France during late January 1944. En route the two torpedo boats were shelled by British coastal artillery and attacked by a pair of British Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers that caused some minor leaks in T28s boiler room from splinter damage. The ship began a long refit upon her arrival that was not completed until early June. As the Allies began landing in Normandy on 6 June, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, now consisting of T28 and the torpedo boats , and , sortied multiple times from Le Havre over the next week in attempts to sink Allied shipping. Despite the expenditure of over 50 torpedoes and large quantities of ammunition, they were generally unsuccessful, only sinking the destroyer on 6 June. T28 was not damaged during the air raid by the Royal Air Force on the night of 14/15 June that sank Falke and Jaguar. On the night of 21/22 July, T28 and three E-boats sailed from Le Havre to Boulogne and fought a brief action with the destroyer en route. The torpedo boat reached Germany on the 27th, having evaded multiple Allied ships on her voyage.Hervieux, p. 100; Rohwer, pp. 301, 331‚Äì332, 341; Whitley 1991, pp. 156, 158, 212 On 20‚Äì21 August T28 and her sister helped to escort the heavy cruiser as she supported a German counterattack near Tukums, Latvia. As the Germans evacuated Tallinn, Estonia, in mid-September, the sisters helped to lay additional minefields in the Gulf of Finland to deny the Soviets access to the western portions of the gulf. On 22 October, T28 and T23 bombarded Soviet positions near Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, breaking up a Soviet attack. A month later, they provided support during a Soviet attack on 19 November, but the Germans were forced to evacuate several days later. In mid-December, the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (, and ), reinforced by T23 and T28, was tasked to lay a new minefield between the Estonian coast and an existing minefield slightly further out to sea. T23 was to escort the other ships and the destroyers were laden with 68 mines each while T28 carried 46. The flotilla sailed on the morning of the 11th and the weather gradually worsened over the course of the day, and the spray and rain made navigation difficult. Slightly off course to the north, Z35 and Z36 blundered into the Nashorn (Rhinoceros) minefield that was only north of the intended position of the new minefield. They both struck mines and sank around 02:00; so close to the minefield, no effort was made to rescue any survivors in the darkness. T28 was refitted in Gotenhafen from October to December.Rohwer, pp. 351, 359, 361, 373, 377; Whitley 1991, pp. 180‚Äì186, 212 Prinz Eugen, two destroyers, T28 and T23 supported a German counterattack against advancing Soviet forces near Cranz, East Prussia, on 29‚Äì30 January 1945. A few days later the ship escorted the heavy cruiser , together with her sisters T23 and off the East Prussian coast on 2‚Äì5 February. Admiral Scheer, T23, T28 and bombarded Soviet positions near Frauenburg in support of the 4th Army on 9‚Äì10 February. T28 and T23 screened the heavy cruiser L√ºtzow as she bombarded Soviet positions south of Danzig on 27 March. The ship screened evacuation convoys from Hela, East Prussia, to friendly territory in early April. On 5 May, T28 helped to ferry 45,000 refugees from East Prussia to Copenhagen, Denmark, and returned to transport 20,000 more to Gl√ºcksburg, Germany, on the 9th.Hervieux, pp. 101‚Äì102; Rohwer, pp. 387, 398, 414; Whitley 1991, pp. 187, 189, 191 =Postwar activities= The ship was allocated to the British when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945. After protests by France, the Royal Navy transferred T28 on 4 February 1946Whitley 1991, pp. 199, 212 and the French Navy renamed her Le Lorrain.Roche, p. 313 She then began a lengthy overhaul in Cherbourg that replaced her radar with an American system and her 3.7 cm guns with 4 cm Bofors guns. The ship was recommissioned in December 1949 and assigned to the Aircraft Carrier Group of the Mediterranean Squadron at Toulon. Le Lorrain was later assigned to the Anti-submarine Group and then served as a trials ship before she was condemned on 31 October 1955 and subsequently sold for scrap.Jordan & Moulin, p. 284 Notes Citations References     * External links * T28 at german navy.de Category:Type 39 torpedo boats Category:1942 ships Category:Ships built by Schichau Category:Ships built in Elbing ","title":"German torpedo boat T28"},{"id":"58675724","text":"√áelebi is a town and district of Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Province in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey.

Family  Kham Bunnag was born in 1813 into the powerful Bunnag family, a powerful Thai noble family of Persian ancestry.Bentiage, Bjorn, Eggert, Marion, Kramer, Hans-Martin, and Reichmuth, Stefan \\"Religious Dynamics Under the Impacts of Imperialism and Colonialism: A Sourcebook\\" pp.63-4 His father, Tish Bunnag, was a kinsman of the royal family who later served as regent for King Mongkut (Rama IV), while his brother Chuang Bunnag would go on to serve as regent for King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).  Government service  Kham Bunnag entered the service of King Nangklao (Rama III), as an official in the Harbour Department. After the death of Rama III, the Bunnag family played a major role in selecting his successor. Kham's strong support for Mongkut earned him a role as Minister of State in 1853, Minister of the Treasury in 1855, and the title of Thiphakorawong in 1865.  Scholarship  After ill health led to his retirement from public life in 1867, Thipakorawong spent the remainder of his life writing on history and religion. In 1867, he wrote his most famous work, Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit (\\"A Book on Various Things\\").Bentiage pp. 67-69 Thipakorawong was commissioned by Chulalongkorn to write the history of the first four reigns of the Chakri dynasty, which he completed before his death in 1870. Though the history was complete by 1870, the section on the reign of Rama III was not published until 1934, due to a controversial section detailing a powerful prince's homosexual inclinations.Reyes, Raquel A. G., Clarence-Smith, William G. \\"Sexual Diversity in Asia, c. 600 - 1950\\" pp. 92-93 Thipakorawong's historical works were often edited, particularly by Prince Damrong, to remove items that were considered scandalous or critical of the early monarchs.  The Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit  Thipakorawong's Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit was a groundbreaking work, said to be both the first science textbook in Thai and the first Thai book to be printed without the assistance of Westerners. In this work, Thipakorawong argued against the literal truth of much traditional Buddhist cosmology (said to be contaminated by Brahmanism), while also attesting to the truth of Buddhist spiritual doctrines and the compatibility of modern science with Buddhism.Winichakul, Thongchai \\"Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of a Nation\\" pp. 42-44 He spent much of the book detailing how karma, reincarnation, and merit account for differences in social orders. While not necessarily derived from Mongkut's reforming views, it was clearly complementary to them.Piker, Steven \\"The Psychological Study of Theravada Societies\\" pp. 18-19 The Nangsue Sadaeng Kitchanukit was translated into English by Henry Alabaster, an advisor to Chulalongkorn. Alabaster published his translation as the first part of his \\"The Wheel of the Law\\" in 1871. While generally regarded as a faithful translation, Alabaster's version omits many sections of Thipakorawong's work, including a defense of polygamy, and also includes his own commentary.

Completed in early 1943, the boat was transferred to France in August. T27 helped to lay a minefield in the English Channel the following month, and later escorted a blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay. She participated in the Battle of Sept-√éles in October and played a minor role in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. The boat was lightly damaged during the Action of 26 April 1944 off the coast of Brittany and ran aground during the subsequent battle two days later. Her wreck was destroyed shortly afterwards by the British. Design and description The Type 39 torpedo boat was conceived as a general-purpose design, much larger than preceding German torpedo boats.Whitley 1991, p. 52 The boats had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of , a draft of at deep load and displaced at standard load and at deep load.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 Their crew numbered 206 officers and sailors.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 239 The Type 39s were fitted with a pair of geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, using steam from four high-pressure water- tube boilers.

T22s hydrophones detected the British ships off the Sept-√éles at 00:25 and (Lieutenant commander) Franz Kohlauf maneuvered his flotilla to intercept them before they could reach M√ºnsterland. Limbourne overheard the radio transmissions about 01:20 as the German ships turned, and alerted the other British ships. At 01:36 Charybdiss radar detected the German torpedo boats at a range of and she fired star shells in an unsuccessful attempt to spot them visually. About this time, T23 spotted Charybdis silhouetted against the lighter horizon and Kohlauf ordered every boat to fire all of their torpedoes. Two of these struck the cruiser, which sank shortly afterwards, and another blew the bow off Limbourne, which had to be scuttled later. The loss of the flagship threw the British into confusion as they had not worked together before the attack, and the torpedo boats successfully disengaged before the senior surviving British captain realized that he was in command.Rohwer, pp. 282; Whitley, pp. 147‚Äì148 =Battle of the Bay of Biscay= Alsterufer burning after a RAF attack On 24‚Äì26 December T27 was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay. Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla and the six torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the Bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, pp. 294‚Äì295; Whitley, p. 149 The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw sea spray over their forward guns that made their operation difficult. It also severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. About that time, the destroyers began firing back with guns and torpedoes; the latter all missed and one hit was made on Glasgow at 14:05.

The Allied fire was accurate and one shell struck T27 at 02:31 and reduced her speed to ; Kohlauf ordered her into Morlaix Bay and the Allies lost her radar reflection amongst the rocks of the bay.Hervieux, p. 99; Rohwer, pp. 317‚Äì318; Whitley, pp. 156‚Äì157 After emergency repairs, T27 joined T24 in Saint-Malo during the night of 26/27 April. The sister departed Saint-Malo bound for Brest on the night of 28/29 April and were spotted by British coastal radar. They intercepted by Haida and Athabaskan off √éle Vierge. Haida opened the engagement by firing star shell at 04:12; the Germans laid a smoke screen in response and turned away. The sisters fired all of their torpedoes as they turned, T24 firing three off the wrong side of the boat, but one of the others hit Athabaskan. Shortly afterwards, she blew up, probably from a magazine explosion, and sank at 04:42. Haida pursued T27 and hit her at least seven times, setting her on fire and destroying both quadruple 2 cm mounts on the bridge wings. While trying to reach Aber Wrac'h, she accidentally ran aground at ; Haida continued to engage the torpedo boat and ignited the 2 cm ready-use ammunition on the bridge wings before returning to rescue Athabaskans survivors. Lacking power, T27s crew was unable to put the fire out and abandoned ship at 04:35, having lost 11 men killed. T24 and a pair of minesweepers later failed in their attempt to pull her off, but they rescued 83 crewmen before they abandoned the wreck.

Accessed 2 June 2020. or Crocodilopolis is an ancient tell (archaeological mound), located near to the mouth of Nahal Taninim, in the vicinity of modern town of Jisr az-Zarka in Israel. The location's name derives from the Nahal Taninim stream, which in Hebrew means the river of crocodiles, referring to Nile crocodiles, which used to reside in the river and nearby swamps until the beginning of the 20th century. The site became first inhabited in the Hellenistic era, established in the 4th century BCE, and continued to exist until the end of the Byzantine period. A Roman period road is passing near the location of the city remains. The Byzantine city was probably destroyed by Arab armies in 636. The tell also includes a tower, a pool and an aqueduct from the Crusader period - the only remains from the Crusader castle of Turris Salinarum (Salt Tower), Burj al-Malih in Arabic. Researchers suppose that the site was utilize for salt production, giving its name to the Crusader castle. The site became abandoned again during the late Middle Ages. In 1834, during Muhammad Ali's rule over the region, the Arab village of Jisr az-Zarka was founded in the vicinity of the tell. Later in the Ottoman era, a bridge was built near the tell in 1898 crossing above the Crocodiles river, as part of preparations towards the visit of the German Emperor Wilhelm II, who requested to pass with his convoy from Haifa to Jerusalem over the coastline. Archaeological survey of the tell, had not been performed until 1975. In 2004, additional archaeological surveys were made at the site.

She also founded periodicals in the fields of industrial education and fashion. Family and education She was born Antoinette Prudence Van Hoesen in Cortland County, New York; her parents were John Van Hoesen and Marian (Adams) Van Hoesen. The Van Hoesens were originally a Dutch family; her paternal grandfather Garret Van Hoesen secured a land grant near what is now Hudson from King George III of England. Her mother died before her first birthday and her father moved the family to Minnesota. Around the age of 10, she was sent to boarding schools in Illinois, first in Evanston and later in Aurora. In 1870, she married Edgar Lewis Wakeman; they settled in Chicago and had a son, John. Career While visiting her brother F. B. Van Hoesen, then a Minnesota State Senator, she met F. A. Carle, editor of the St. Paul Pioneer-Press, who encouraged her to contribute letters to his paper. Later she became a paid contributor to other periodicals across the country, including the Chautauquan, the New York Sun, and House Beautiful. Wakeman founded the Journal of Industrial Education in the late 1880s, serving as its publisher and editor for several years. She also founded a fashion magazine in New York at the invitation of a company that sold clothing patterns. She found this job uncongenial and resigned, returning to Chicago. She next joined the staff of the Chicago Evening Journal. When the Chicago Evening Post was established, she joined its staff as both an editor and an art critic, remaining for four years. Wakeman wrote on a variety of subjects relevant to women readers of her day, ranging from industrial education to dressmaking to women as stock farmers. Although she preferred newspaper work to other kinds of writing, she published poems and a play as well. Wakeman was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club and one of the founders of the Illinois Women's Press Association. She was struck by an automobile in New York on November 15, 1921, and died from her injuries at Bellevue Hospital on December 8. Books * Scientific Sewing and Garment Cutting (1898; with Louise M.

Completed in early 1942, the ship was transferred to France later that year where she escorted blockade runners and Axis submarines through the Bay of Biscay. T22 also laid minefields in the English Channel in mid-1943. She participated in the Battle of Sept-√éles, where she crippled a British destroyer, and the Battle of the Bay of Biscay later that year. After returning to Germany in early 1944, T22 struck a pair of mines in Narva Bay in August and blew up, with the loss of 143 men.

Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel, six C/38 guns in one quadruple mount on the aft superstructure and a pair of single mounts on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work the ships were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1944 the single 2 cm mounts in the bridge wings were replaced by quadruple mounts and FuMB7 \\"Naxos\\" and FuMB8 \\"Wanz G\\" radar detectors were installed.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career Originally ordered as a Type 37 torpedo boat on 30 March 1939, T22 was reordered on 10 November 1939 from Schichau. She was built at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1481, launched in 1941 and commissioned on 28 February 1942. While working up, the ship conducted training exercises in the Baltic with the battleship , the light cruisers and , the destroyers , and , and the torpedo boats , , , and on 1‚Äì3 October. Later that month T22 was transferred to France. T22, her sister , and Falke and Kondor escorted the Italian blockade runner from Bordeaux through the Bay of Biscay on 29‚Äì30 November. Another Italian blockade runner, Himalaya, escorted by T22, T23, Kondor and the torpedo boats and , failed in her attempt to break through the Bay of Biscay when she was spotted by British aircraft and forced to return by heavy aerial attacks on 9‚Äì11 April 1943. On 5‚Äì8 May, the 2nd Torpedo Boat Flotilla with T22, T2, T5, and T23 laid three minefields in the Channel. Now assigned to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, T22, Kondor, Falke, and laid two more minefields in the Channel on 4‚Äì6 June.Rohwer, pp. 199, 215, 241, 249, 254; Whitley, pp. 144, 211 The following month the ships returned to the Bay of Biscay to help escort U-boats through the Bay as part of the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. On 2 August T22 and her sisters and , responding to a distress call from another submarine, rescued survivors from the submarine . From 29 to 31 August, the same three ships escorted the through the Bay to Lorient. While providing distant cover for a small convoy during the night of 3/4 October, the 4th Flotilla spotted a force of five British destroyers off the Sept-√éles near the coast of Brittany in the Channel and attacked with complete surprise. The first volley of five torpedoes all missed, but the British did not see them and continued on their course. Only when T23 turned on her radar to determine the range for a second volley did they react when one of the British destroyers detected the radar; they altered course just in time for all six of T22s torpedoes to miss. Two of the British ships were able to pursue the retreating Germans at high speed, but both were damaged by German gunfire and forced to disengage.Rohwer, pp. 256‚Äì257, 269, 279; Whitley, pp. 145, 147 =Battle of Sept-√éles= On 22 October, the 4th Flotilla, now consisting of T22, T23, T25, and their sisters and , sortied from Brest to provide cover for the unladen blockade runner and her close escort from the 2nd Minesweeping Flotilla as they sailed up the Channel. The British were aware of M√ºnsterland and attempted to intercept her on the night of the 23rd with a scratch force that consisted of the light cruiser and the destroyers , , , , and . T22s hydrophones detected the British ships off the Sept-√éles at 00:25 and Korvettenkapit√§n Franz Kohlauf maneuvered his flotilla to intercept them before they could reach M√ºnsterland.

At 01:36 Charybdiss radar detected the German torpedo boats at a range of and she fired star shells in an unsuccessful attempt to spot them visually. About this time, the Germans spotted Charybdis silhouetted against the lighter horizon and Kohlauf ordered every ship to fire all of their torpedoes. Two of these struck the cruiser, which sank shortly afterwards, and one of T22s torpedoes blew the bow off Limbourne, which had to be scuttled later. The loss of the flagship threw the British into confusion as they had not worked together before the attack, and the torpedo boats successfully disengaged before the senior surviving British captain realized that he was in command.Rohwer, pp. 282; Whitley, pp. 147‚Äì148 =Battle of the Bay of Biscay= Map of the Battle of Biscay On 24‚Äì26 December T22 was one of the escorts for the blockade runner through the Bay of Biscay. Another blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship , trailed Osorno by several days and four destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla and the six torpedo boats of the 4th Flotilla set sail on 27 December to escort her through the Bay. The Allies were aware of these blockade runners through their Ultra code-breaking efforts and positioned cruisers and aircraft in the Western Atlantic to intercept them in Operation Stonewall. A Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber from No. 311 Squadron RAF sank Alsterufer later that afternoon.Rohwer, pp. 294‚Äì295; Whitley, p. 149 The German ships were unaware of the sinking until the following afternoon and continued onward to the rendezvous point. They had been spotted by an American Liberator bomber on the morning of the 28th and the British light cruisers and , which were assigned to Stonewall, maneuvered to intercept them. By this time, the weather had gotten significantly worse and the German ships were steaming for home, hampered by the rough seas that threw sea spray over their forward guns which made their operation difficult. It also severely reduced visibility and hampered the rangefinders and sights for the guns and torpedoes. Norman Wilkinson Using her radar, Glasgow was the first to open fire at 13:46 at a range of with Enterprise following a few minutes later. At about that time, the torpedo boats began firing back with guns and torpedoes; the latter all missed but one hit was made on Glasgows forward boiler room at 14:05, killing two sailors manning the port QF 2-pounder naval gun and wounding six others. Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Hans Erdmenger, commander of the 8th Flotilla, decided to split his forces and ordered the destroyers , , and the torpedo boats T22, T25 and T26 to reverse course to the north at 14:18. The cruisers pursued them with Enterprise crippling Z27 and Glasgow doing the same to T25 and then T26. T22 attempted to close with T25 so she could take off the latter's crew and fired all of her torpedoes and guns at Glasgow at 14:58 in an attempt to drive the cruiser off, but all of the torpedoes missed and her gunfire was ineffective. Shell splashes from Glasgow surrounded T22 and she laid a smoke screen as she was forced to turn away. The ship later encountered Z23 and the two arrived at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, close to the Spanish border, later that day.Hervieux, p. 98; Rohwer, p. 295; Whitley 1991, pp. 149‚Äì153; Brice, p. 138 = Loss = In early February 1944, T22 and T23 returned to Germany via the Channel and T22 began a refit at Elbing that lasted until June. The ship was then assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla operating in the Baltic. The flotilla, consisting of T22 and her sisters and , was tasked to lay a minefield in Narva Bay, off the Estonian coast, on the night of 17/18 August. Reinforced by T23 from the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, the ships loaded 54 mines each in Helsinki, Finland, and departed on the evening of the 17th. Shortly after midnight, they started to lay their mines, but had only just begun when T30 struck a pair of mines about 00:25 which knocked out all electrical power. About a minute after that, T32 also struck a pair of mines that blew her bow off and disabled her engines. At 00:30 T30 exploded and broke in half, probably after hitting another mine.

The boat was then assigned to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla operating in the Baltic. She was attached to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla to help them lay a minefield in Narva Bay, off the Estonian coast, on the night of 17/18 August. The boats, T23, T22 and their sisters and each loaded 54 mines in Helsinki, Finland, and departed on the evening of the 17th. Shortly after midnight, they started to lay their mines, but had only just begun when T30 struck a pair of mines about 00:25 which knocked out all electrical power. About a minute after that, T32 also struck a pair of mines that blew her bow off and disabled her engines. At this T22s crew began making her mines safe and jettisoning them to clear the quarterdeck for towing. At 00:30 T30 exploded and broke in half, probably after hitting another mine. T22s crew finished jettisoning her mines at 00:40 and signaled T32 to see if she was ready to be towed. T32 replied that she was not able to be towed forward, which meant that she would have to be towed stern-first. Around 00:50 T22 began to approach T32 despite being warned that mines were present and struck two of them and blew up at around 01:14. Four minutes later, look-outs reported a motor torpedo boat moving fast aft of the ship and the hydrophones picked up engine noises. Korvettenleutnant Weinlig, thinking that the explosions that sank T22 were torpedoes rather than mines, decided that T23 needed to withdraw lest she be sunk as well, despite the presence of survivors in the water and the crippled T32. He radioed for shallow-draft boats to rescue the survivors at 01:20 and headed west with multiple reports of other ships nearby for the next several hours. At 01:50, T23 encountered the submarine and Weinlig was preparing to attack before she was recognized as a German submarine. The Soviets never claimed to have sunk any of the torpedo boats that night and the 01:18 spot report was undoubtedly a pinnace from T30 that was pulling survivors from the water.Gr√∂ner, p. 195; Hervieux, p. 101; Rohwer, p. 338; Whitley 1991, pp. 156, 175‚Äì179, 211 On 20‚Äì21 August, T23 and her sister helped to escort the heavy cruiser as she supported a German counterattack near Tukums, Latvia. As the Germans evacuated Tallinn, Estonia, in mid-September, the sisters helped to lay additional minefields in the Gulf of Finland to deny the Soviets access to the western portions of the gulf. On 22 October, T23 and T28 bombarded Soviet positions near Sworbe, on the Estonian island of Saaremaa, breaking up a Soviet attack. A month later, they provided support during a Soviet attack on 19 November, but the Germans were forced to evacuate several days later. In mid-December, the 6th Destroyer Flotilla (, and ), reinforced by T23 and T28, was tasked to lay a new minefield between the Estonian coast and an existing minefield slightly further out to sea. T23 was to escort the other ships and the destroyers were laden with 68 mines each. The flotilla sailed on the morning of the 11th and the weather gradually worsened over the course of the day, and the spray and rain made navigation difficult. Slightly off course to the north, Z35 and Z36 blundered into the Nashorn (Rhinoceros) minefield that was only north of the intended position of the new minefield. They both struck mines and sank around 02:00; so close to the minefield, no effort was made to rescue any survivors in the darkness.Rohwer, pp. 351, 359, 361, 373, 377; Whitley 1991, pp. 180‚Äì186, 212 Prinz Eugen, two destroyers, T23 and T28 supported a German counterattack against advancing Soviet forces near Cranz, East Prussia, on 29‚Äì30 January 1945.

Eastern Montana has considerable oil and gas resources, while the uplifted Rocky Mountains in the west, which resulted from the Laramide orogeny and other tectonic events have locations with metal ore. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The oldest rocks in Montana are part of the Archean Wyoming Craton in the center and east of the state, primarily between Livingston and Red Lodge, as well as small areas in the Little Belt Mountains around Neihart and the core of the Little Rocky Mountains south of Harlem. Drill cores indicate that these rocks underlie much of the Great Plains. Rainbow Peak and Bowman Lake, Glacier National Park The Pony Group, Cherry Creek Group and the Stillwater Complex are examples of Precambrian metamorphic rock units The first two groups are made up of folded and metamorphosed marine sedimentary rocks which were folded, metamorphosed. They were subsequently intruded by gabbro, diabase and granite. The Stillwater Complex, by contrast, is made up of ultrabasic igneous rocks exposed at the surface in Park, Stillwater, and Sweet Grass Counties. Together, these three rock formations formed between 2.54 and 1.69 billion years ago. The Pony Group and Cherry Creek Group are overlain by the Belt Series sedimentary rocks, which deposited after a period of erosion that left a large unconformity. These shallow water rocks from the Neoproterozoic range between 35,000 and 50,000 feet thick, overlain by additional Middle Cambrian sedimentary rocks. Iceberg Lake Ridge, Glacier National Park Belt rocks make up the mountains around St. Mary Lake at Glacier National Park. Deposition took place in a broad trough extending southeast to the Big Snowy Mountains as well as to the southwest through Three Forks, Whitehall, the Highland Mountains, and Armstead. Regional low-grade metamorphism altered sandstone, carbonates and silty shale to quartzite, argillite and dolomite. Geologists divide the rocks into four units, from oldest to youngest the pre-Ravalli rocks, the Ravalli, the Piegan, and the Missoula groups. In some locations, late Precambrian sills, dikes and lava flows are found. The Sunshine Mine in the Coeur d'Alene district of Idaho, which is in correlates with the Ravalli Group. Uranium mineralized in the rock 1.19 million years ago, giving a young age for limit for the surrounding rocks. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Thick sequences of sedimentary rock deposited during the Paleozoic, reaching thicknesses of up to 10,000 feet. Sixteen miles west of Missoula and further west, all Paleozoic rocks have eroded away. To the east, Paleozoic rocks are exposed and upturned along the Rocky Mountains. Most Paleozoic rocks originated in a marine environment, particularly dolomite and limestone together with shale, siltstone, sandstone, and evaporites such as gypsum, anhydrite and salt. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= During the Mesozoic, one mile thick sedimentary rocks accumulated across 55 percent of the state. They are exposed at the surface due to the Black Hills uplift and the Cedar Creek Anticline. Marine rocks alternate with terrestrial sandstone, indicating a string of marine transgression and regression events. In the Cretaceous, the Laramide orogeny began to assemble the Rocky Mountains, intruding granite in Ravalli County as well as the Boulder batholith and Tobacco Root batholith. Tuff and andesite lava flows resulting from volcanic eruptions is found interbedded in sedimentary rocks. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= Continued uplift due to the Laramide orogeny drove accelerated erosion in the Cenozoic. Eastern Montana lowlands were covered in up to 4000 feet of sediment. The Fort Union Formation in the east, made up of the Tongue River, Lebo and Tullock members is a remnant of Paleocene deposition. It is overlain by Wasatch Formation mudstone and stream conglomerate which has been significantly eroded. Intermontane valleys preserve thick sequences of Oligocene and Miocene rocks that are rare in other parts of the Eastern Plains. These sediments vary considerably, from claystone, mudstone and siltstone to bentonite, diatomaceous earth, coal and tuff. The Flaxville Formation is the youngest rock unit Montana from the Pliocene. Natural resource geology Igneous intrusive rocks are associated with metals such as copper, gold, silver, lead, zinc and tungsten. In the Idaho batholith, Boulder batholith and Tobacco Root batholith, intrusive granite bodies are particularly common and often contain metal ore. Precambrian rocks in the southwest contain corundum, talc, iron ore, graphite, sillimanite and kyanite in the Cherry Creek Group, while chromite is common in the Stillwater Complex that spans Stillwater and Sweet Grass counties. The western third of Montana has sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic which are potential sources of phosphate rock, limestone, silica, crushed stone and clay. In places bentonite has been mined altered volcanic ash beds in Cenozoic intermontane sedimentary basins. Central Montana has metal ore deposits that have been mined in the Little Rocky Mountains, the North Moccasin Mountains, the Judith Mountains and the Little Belt Mountains. The region also has significant production of oil and natural gas from the Cat Creek anticline, the Kevin-Sunburst dome and the Sweet Grass arch. Mesozoic sandstones are a primary reservoir rock. Some Cretaceous sandstone, for example The third Cat Creek sandstone at the base of the Kootenai Formation, the Virgelle sandstone member of the Eagle sandstone, and the Fox Hill sandstone, are valuable ground water aquifers all dating to the Cretaceous. The Kootenai Formation also contains clay usable for brick and tile. Much of central Montana is underlain by Jurassic and Cretaceous coal beds. Although there are no metal ore deposits in the eastern third of the state, the region holds more than 90 percent of Montana's coal reserves. The coal is part of the Paleocene Fort Union Formation, particularly the Tongue River Member. The eastern region produces petroleum, principally in the western Williston Basin and the Cedar Creek anticline. Most hydrocarbons come from Paleozoic rocks, although some are sourced from Cretaceous rock. Bentonite is mined from Cretaceous beds in Carter County.http://mbmg.mtech.edu/sp28/geology.htm External links *http://www.gravmag.com/gibson-geology.pdf *https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_16363.htm *http://www.mbmg.mtech.edu/mbmgcat/public/ListCitation.asp?pub_id=11596& *https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/mt_geoheritage/sites/augusta_choteau/stratigraphy.html *https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/map-us.html References Montana ","title":"Geology of Montana"},{"id":"58676271","text":"Dr. Joanna Hoffmann-Dietrich (born 1968 in Pozna≈Ñ)Details on Joanna Hoffmann- Dietrich - ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe website is an artist and academic and a Professor at the University of Fine Arts in Pozna≈Ñ in Poland and a Fellow of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage in Poland.Short biography - Joanna Hoffmann-Dietrich From 1987 to 1992 Hoffmann-Dietrich studied for her degree at the Academy of Fine Arts in Pozna≈Ñ (now the University of Fine Arts) before starting her MA in 1992 and gained her PhD in 2000.Biography and CV for Hoffmann Hoffmann-Dietrich mostly works in the fields of multimedia installations, experimental video-animation, and book art.

Descending from an old family of boyars, he was one of two sons born to Ban Grigore III BƒÉleanu; the other, Nicolae, was a career bureaucrat, and the State Secretary of Wallachia in 1855‚Äì1856. Although prone to displays of Romanian nationalism, the family was prominent under the cosmopolitan Phanariotes, and young BƒÉleanu was educated in Greek. Prince Alexandros Soutzos welcomed him at the court and became his father-in-law. At that stage, BƒÉleanu's participation in the spoils system was signaled by his highly controversial claim to ownership of T√¢rgovi»ôte city, and also by his monopoly on handkerchief manufacture. His father hoped to steer the anti-Phanariote revolt of 1821, but both he and Emanoil were driven into exile when Bucharest fell to the rebels. In exile, BƒÉleanu Jr began gravitating toward liberalism, before becoming curious about utopian socialism. Under the Regulamentul Organic regime, he was made Polkovnik in the Wallachian military forces and served two terms in the Ordinary National Assembly. He and Ioan C√¢mpineanu emerged as leaders of the \\"National Party\\", which mounted the opposition to Alexandru II Ghica and uncovered constitutional irregularities. BƒÉleanu was sent into internal exile in 1841, but reinstated following interventions by his friends in the Russian Empire and the Wallachian Church. He ran in the princely election of 1842, but conceded defeat in favor of his friend Gheorghe Bibescu, who then made him his Postelnic (1843‚Äì1847). As such, BƒÉleanu contributed directly to the modernization of Wallachia, and also to the early stages of abolitionism‚Äîthough he himself remained a slave owner to 1855. BƒÉleanu joined the conservative camp during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. For a few days in June‚ÄìJuly of that year, he proclaimed himself Caimacam, heading a reactionary administration alongside Metropolitan Neofit II. Before being deposed and driven out of Wallachia, he gave the order to destroy revolutionary symbols, including the \\"Statue of Liberty\\". Returning with the Ottoman Army, he was again promoted under Prince Barbu Dimitrie »òtirbei, and especially during the late stages of the Crimean War, which removed Russian tutelage. His focus fell on obtaining a close alliance between Wallachia and the Austrian Empire. BƒÉleanu's second, internationally recognized, term as Caimacam was within a triumvirate that also included Ioan Filipescu-Vulpache and Ioan Manu; alongside the latter, BƒÉleanu instituted a repressive regime, directing censorship and intimidation against the National Party. They organized the legislative elections of 1859, but were outmaneuvered by liberals and nationalists, who managed to push through their agenda. BƒÉleanu was brutalized and shunned during events leading up to the establishment of the United Principalities, which put an end to his political career. His only literary work was a manuscript chronicle, which was later exposed as plagiarized. Biography =Early life= The BƒÉleanus, whose history is linked to an an eponymous estate in D√¢mbovi»õa County, belonged to Wallachia's older lineage of boyar nobility, and claimed kinship with the ancient House of Basarab.ChiricƒÉ, p. 352; Lecca, p. 9 The family patriarch was Udrea BƒÉleanu, who served as Ban of Oltenia in the 1590s.Potra (1990 II), p. 154 His nephew, Iva»ôco I BƒÉleanu, emerged as a powerful player in 1630s Wallachia, having backed Matei Basarab for Wallachia's throne; his son, Gheorghe BƒÉleanu, similarly endorsed and fought alongside Constantin »òerban.Stoicescu, pp. 114‚Äì116 He was prominent into the 1670s, when he and his family feuded with the Cantacuzinos; their conflict came to an end in 1679, when Gheorghe's son, Iva»ôco II, was sent into exile.Stoicescu, pp. 116‚Äì118, 135‚Äì139, 165, 173, 195‚Äì196, 215‚Äì216 Emanoil was Iva»ôco II's great-great-grandson.Lecca, p. 9 He was born in 1793 or 1794 as the son of Ban Grigore III BƒÉleanu (1770‚Äì1842) and his wife Maria, n√©e Br√¢ncoveanu (?‚Äì1837).Crutzescu & Teodorescu, p. 498; Ion & Berindei, p. 215; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 231; Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 315.

XI‚ÄìXIV), pp. XVI‚ÄìXVII, XXVII. Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1975. Historian Radu Crutzescu proposes that Emanoil's political rise was in large part owed to his kinship with two families: the VƒÉcƒÉrescus and the Soutzos; he was uncle of Mari»õica VƒÉcƒÉrescu, who was to become Prince Gheorghe Bibescu's wife, and, through his marriage with Catinca, son-in-law of Wallachia's last Phanariote Prince, Alexandros Soutzos.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 231 A Wallachian comedy of ca. 1820 shows Ban Grigore trafficking in influence to benefit his in-laws.Cornelia Papacostea-Danielopolu, \\"La satire sociale- politique dans la litt√©rature dramatique en langue grecque des Principaut√©s (1774‚Äî1830)\\", in Revue Des √âtudes Sud-est Europ√©ennes, Vol. XV, Issue 1, January‚ÄìMarch 1977, p. 83 Phanariote favoritism was also noted by memoirist Ion Ghica. He mentions that Emanoil's Greek education is what drew Prince Soutzos' attention. Upon his wedding to Catinca, BƒÉleanu received ownership of T√¢rgovi»ôte, which the Prince had abusively claimed as his own; when news of this deal reached the sparked city, the rioting citizens placed a jinx on Soutzos' house.Crutzescu & Teodorescu, p. 216; Ghica & Roman, pp. 90, 254‚Äì256 Catinca's dowry also included a monopoly on the manufacture of handkerchiefs, which came with additional tax privileges and the right to employ 30 foreign laborers. This included ownership of the textile mill at MƒÉrcu»õa Church, which BƒÉleanu immediately leased to a Russian immigrant.»òerban, p. 51.

Both were seen as dangerous suspects by agents of the S√ªret√©. This period was ended by the war of 1828, which again saw both Principalities invaded by the Russian Empire. The Russians and Ottomans reached a compromise on joint rule, and granted a charter, called Regulamentul Organic, which codified fundamental laws in Wallachia and Moldavia. This document was partly co-written by Grigore BƒÉleanu and Iordache Filipescu.Crutzescu & Teodorescu, p. 498 The throne in Bucharest was assigned to Alexandru II Ghica, who presided over an era of Westernization. In 1830, formally renouncing Ottoman clothing,Potra (1990 I), p. 484 Emanoil BƒÉleanu was integrated within the restored and modernized Wallachian military forces. He was one of the last boyars to be granted automatic advancement based on high birth, and almost immediately received the rank of Polkovnik (Colonel).LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 50 He was first assigned command over the 1st Infantry Regiment at Craiova, serving under Russian commanders.

According to LƒÉcusteanu, they relied on take-out food and slept at a local pub.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 57 While his father was a sponsor of the conservative poet Grigore Alexandrescu,Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, p. 252; Dima et al., p. 312 BƒÉleanu was sympathetic to Wallachian liberalism, and welcomed in his home Teodor Diamant, who actively campaigned in favor of Fourierism.Ghica & Roman, pp. 292‚Äì293 The BƒÉleanus were otherwise still committed to the preservation of traditional institutions, including slavery.

BƒÉleanu, Ioan C√¢mpineanu, Grigore Cantacuzino and Iancu Ruset presided over a liberal faction sometimes labeled as \\"National Party\\", and by 1834 produced designs on how to rewrite Regulamentul into a set of reformist policies.Ghica & Roman, pp. 422‚Äì423.

This had been set up for Bibescu's estranged wife Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu, whom the prince had declared insane,Bibescu, pp. 96, 98 and who was BƒÉleanu's cousin.

Panaitescu, Contribu»õii la o biografie a lui N. BƒÉlcescu, p. 47. Bucharest: Convorbiri Literare, 1924. Within three years, the two camps had come to oppose each other openly. Early June 1848 witnessed the eruption of a Wallachia's liberal Revolution, which first limited Bibescu's authoritarian rule, then deposed him. After the abdication, the boyars assembled and elected BƒÉleanu as Caimacam, or co-regent, alongside Neofit and Ban Teodor VƒÉcƒÉrescu-FurtunƒÉ; they were deposed after attempting to reverse the revolutionary trend.Crutzescu & Teodorescu, p. 499 Later that month, generalized panic was created by rumors of a Russian incursion in Wallachia, and the revolutionary administration abandoned Bucharest for the more secluded town of RucƒÉr. On June 29, Neofit seized the opportunity and established another conservative government. BƒÉleanu became Caimacam, alongside Filipescu-Vulpache and VƒÉcƒÉrescu-FurtunƒÉ.Bibescu, pp. 379‚Äì380; Crutzescu & Teodorescu, pp. 191, 499.

The incident was also noted by the far-left radical BƒÉlcescu, who insisted that government make its resolutions into permanent laws. According to BƒÉlcescu, BƒÉleanu was to be prevented from ever returning to Bucharest.Dan Berindei, \\"Contradic»õiile de clasƒÉ √Æn desfƒÉ»ôurarea revolu»õiei muntene din 1848\\", in Studii.

It also included Scarlat Ghica, Ioan SlƒÉtineanu, and Nicolae Su»õu.Xenopol, p. 428 In September 1848, the Ottomans invaded and occupied Wallachia, which was again placed under a conservative regime. With Constantin Cantacuzino as Wallachia's new Caimacam, BƒÉleanu, Filipescu-Vulpea and Petrache Poenaru returned as efori, and staged a clampdown on revolutionary teachers.Potra (1963), pp. 166‚Äì168 His brother Nicolae was appointed a Logothete, and served in the post- revolutionary administration of Bucharest. In October, he networked between the city guilds to ensure that the city and the Ottoman Army were properly supplied with bread.Margareta Savin, \\"Contribu»õii documentare cu privire la cunoa»ôterea cheltuielilor pentru trupele de ocupa»õie a Bucure»ôtilor √Æn anii 1848‚Äî1851\\", in Muzeul Na»õional, Vol. II, 1975, p. 472 »òtirbei was afterwards crowned Prince, more fully restoring the Regulamentul regime.

See also Crutzescu & Teodorescu, p. 499 He also returned as chairman of the Assembly. Nevertheless, for several years after the Revolution's defeat, BƒÉleanu failed to impose himself in political life: the newspaper Vestitorul Rom√¢nesc dismissed him as \\"entirely unremarkable\\". He had by then returned to his activities as an industrialist, with a new textile factory, which employed as many as 200 workers, opened in Dragomire»ôti.L. Botezan, \\"Problema agrarƒÉ √Æn dezbaterile parlamentare din Rom√Ænia √Æn anul 1862\\", in Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai. Historia, Vol. IV, Issue 1, 1961, p. 109 He stood out among conservatives for opposing all attempt at implementing land reform, and also for resisting the projected reductions of boyar privilege.Xenopol, p. 426 BƒÉleanu also remained a slave-owner and, in May 1850, had a runaway Romani family returned to him by the authorities in Dolj County.Achim et al., pp. XXXI, LXII, 141 The Regulamentul period ended during the Crimean War, which was a clash between the Principalities' Russian and Ottoman protectors. »òtirbei left Wallachia, without abdicating, in October 1853 and his cabinet continued to function.Iorga (1910), pp. 156‚Äì159 In April 1854, Spatharios NƒÉsturel-Herescu sought to integrate the Wallachian army into Halim Pasha's Ottoman troops; on August 23, Omar Pasha instituted martial law, and on August 31 set up a new government, headed by NƒÉsturel and Cantacuzino.Iorga (1910), pp. 161‚Äì164 By then, Austria had effectively occupied Wallachia, and the Ottoman presence was symbolic. In that context, Nicolae BƒÉleanu was involved in state-sponsored abolitionism, serving on a financial committee that also included Ioan Manu, and later as Chairman of the Wallachian Treasury.Achim et al., pp. 192‚Äì193, 196‚Äì197, 203‚Äì212 =Triumvirate and downfall= »òtirbei returned as an Austrian proteg√© on September 23, creating himself a new cabinet, with Nicolae BƒÉleanu serving as State Secretary.Iorga (1910), pp. 166‚Äì167, 187 Emanoil also returned as Interior Minister. On December 14, 1855, both brothers, alongside C√¢mpineanu, Filipescu-Vulpache, Alexandru Plagino and George Barbu »òtirbei, signed the decree which emancipated all of Wallachia's 200,000 slaves.Gheorghe Sion, Suvenire contimporane, p. 53. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1915. Emanoil then oversaw the effort to count and register the newly freed Romanies.Achim et al., pp. 222‚Äì223 Meanwhile, Austrian occupation was giving way to a shared custody of Wallachia and Moldavia by a consortium of European powers, backing Ottoman suzerainty. Prince »òtirbei finally resigned on June 25, 1856: from Pite»ôti, he declared Secretary Nicolae BƒÉleanu as the highest authority in Wallachia. On July 4, he resigned in favor of his brother's enemy, Alexandru II Ghica, who took the title of Caimacam.Iorga (1910), p. 187 Ghica turned increasingly liberal, and was regarded by his Austrian supervisors as \\"almost child-like\\";Iorga (1928), p. 418 the BƒÉleanus, meanwhile, endured as conservative leaders. That year, poet Dimitrie Bolintineanu characterized Emanoil as a figure out of Moli√®re's comedies and an ultra-reactionary: \\"he wishes to preserve all titles, honors, privileges, [and] has protection from Russia and Austria\\". While similarly noting BƒÉleanu's Austrian sympathies, Franz von Wimpffen cautioned that he was also lazy, unintelligent, and corrupt. With this platform and backing, BƒÉleanu ran in the September 1857 election and took a seat in the Assembly, which had been reconstructed and enlarged as an \\"ad hoc Divan\\". On October 21, 1858,Bibescu, pp. 518‚Äì519 Emanoil BƒÉleanu, Manu and Filipescu-Vulpache were formally appointed as Caimacami. The firman confirming this arrangement specified that BƒÉleanu oversaw Internal Affairs, while Vulpache was Logothete and Manu chaired the Divan. BƒÉleanu's return was especially controversial: he was now regarded as a leading adversary of the National Party, which sought to obtain a union between Wallachia and Moldavia.ChiricƒÉ, pp. 353‚Äì354 He and Manu clashed with the more liberal Vulpache as early as October 29, when they promoted their political friend SlƒÉtineanu as Minister of Education.Ioan C. Filitti, \\"Ioan SlƒÉtineanu‚ÄîCel d'int√¢iu ocƒÉrmuitor al BrƒÉilei dupƒÉ 1829 (Noti»õƒÉ biograficƒÉ)\\", in Analele BrƒÉilei. RevistƒÉ de CulturƒÉ RegionalƒÉ, Vol. I, Issues 2‚Äì3, March‚ÄìJune 1929, p. 82 The two conservative Caimacami were in a position to control the new elections for the Divan, and were widely suspected of intending to manipulate results. Threats were posted on their townhouse gates, describing them as the \\"bandit brothers\\"ChiricƒÉ, p. 354 and hinting at popular revenge. An incendiary device was reportedly thrown into Manu's home. In December, after the breakdown of negotiations between foreign diplomats, the issue of electoral fraud became an international scandal.ChiricƒÉ, pp. 354‚Äì355 Revelations had also emerged that the Caimacami had denied eligibility to some of the leading National-Party candidates, including Vasile Boerescu, Cezar Bolliac, and C. A. Rosetti. Such restrictions relied on different readings of the suffrage qualifications: while Manu and BƒÉleanu argued that candidates needed to own landed estates, Vulpache offered a dissenting opinion, with no restrictions for burghers or industrialists; this created a definitive schism within the regency, and pushed Vulpache closer to the National Party.ChiricƒÉ, p. 355 Though they went back on some of their more controversial decisions, the other two Caimacami proceeded to govern by increasingly dictatorial means, suspending judicial independence, generalizing censorship, and ordering troops to mobilize in areas of the country that showed vocal support for unionism.ChiricƒÉ, pp. 355‚Äì356 The regency also restricted all forms of electoral propaganda.Gherghe, p. 170 The elections doubled as a contest for the princely throne, with both Bibescu and »òtirbei entering the race. Although BƒÉleanu himself was a client of both former princes, he registered as a candidate, with his new title of Ban, also running against his father-in-law BƒÉlƒÉceanu.ChiricƒÉ, p. 357 On this second attempt, he was credited with minimal chances, being an \\"unexpected\\" contender.Iorga (1910), p. 139 The elections produced unintended results for all of the conservative groups: backed by radicalized crowds, the National Party was able to pass resolutions in favor of union, and to invalidate seven deputies. As reported by Alexandru G. Golescu, \\"that swine Manu\\" and \\"that idiot BƒÉleanu\\" had to leave the Divan's hall and were heckled and threatened as they returned to their homes.Andrei O»õetea, \\"√énsemnƒÉtatea istoricƒÉ a Unirii\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, pp. 36‚Äì37 He also suggests that BƒÉleanu begged the crowd for forgiveness, but was merely derided.N. AdƒÉniloaiei, Matei D. Vlad, \\"Rolul maselor populare √Æn fƒÉurirea Unirii »öƒÉrilor Rom√Æne\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Vol. XII, Issue 1, 1959, p. 96 Eventually, the Divan elected Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Domnitor. Having already carried the Moldavian election, Cuza was positioned to create the United Principalities, initially as a personal union. BƒÉleanu left Wallachia during the union process, and in June 1858 had reached the Grand Duchy of Baden. He died in 1862, and was buried at Bolintin-Deal.

Early life Maude Rooney was born Mary Maude Mahony in 1902 in County Antrim. She was one of the three sons and three daughters of a retired RIC district inspector and his wife Frances Charlotte. Rooney grew up in Holywood, County Down, and was educated locally. She worked as a secretary to Lord Oranmore and Browne at Castlemargaret, County Mayo. During the Emergency, she was a captain in the voluntary division of the Red Cross from 1939 to 1945. She married Michael Rooney, an insurance official, in 1946 at Westland Row Church, Dublin. The couple lived at Redesdale Road, Mount Merrion, Dublin. Advocacy work Rooney joined the Irish Housewives Association (IHA) in 1949. Between 1949 and 1965, Rooney acted as honorary treasurer, minutes secretary, and joint honorary secretary of the IHA. She represented the Association at the women's advisory committee of the institute for industrial research and standards in 1964. Around the same time, Rooney was a member of the IHA's social and international sub-committees, and sat on the editorial board which published The Irish Housewife and later The Irish Housewives' Voice. From 1965 to 1968, Rooney was the chairwoman of the IHA, overseeing the establishment of branches across Ireland, with these branches developing their own agendas. She attended the fourth biennial conference of the international office of consumers' unions in Israel in June 1966. Taking inspiration from what she saw, Rooney started lengthy discussions within the IHA on consumer protection. This resulted in the decision that Ireland needed a group to concentrate on consumer rights and that this fell outside the remit of the IHA. To start this new group, the IHA convened a meeting of all interested parties on 7 September 1966 in Shelbourne Hotel. This resulted in a steering committee, which then called a public meeting on 29 October 1966 at the Metropole. It was at this meeting that Rooney was elected chairwoman of the newly established Consumers' Association of Ireland. She later became vice-chairman, a position she held until her death. A large amount of her time was given over to being an unpaid complaints officer. Rooney also served as the IHA representative in a rates study group in 1967, and was part of the IHA delegation to the International Alliance of Women in the same year. At this meeting the UN commission urged the national groups to examine women's status in their respective countries, and to lobby their governments for a national commission on women. Taking on this, Rooney presided over a meeting of numerous Irish women's groups on 30 January 1968 in the Central Hotel, Dublin. She served on the women's advisory committee again in 1971. She was on the leaders of a protest march in Dublin in November 1974 which protested rising prices. Death and legacy Rooney died suddenly on 9 December 1974 in Dublin, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. On the day after her death, proposals were submitted to the Irish government by the national consumer advisory council that incorporated many of the ideals she had advocated for throughout her life.

The region experienced igneous activity and the addition of new terranes and orogeny mountain building events throughout the Paleozoic, followed by the rifting of the Atlantic Ocean and the deposition of thick sediments in the Coastal Plain and offshore waters.https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=a8281cbd24b84239b29cd2ca798d4a10 Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The oldest rocks in North Carolina are part of the Grenville Province, which stretches from Texas to Labrador and which was impacted by the Grenville orogeny in the Mesoproterozoic to form the Appalachian Mountains. Grenville age rocks are exposed in the Blue Ridge province and the Sauratown Mountains. The Bakersville mafic dike swarm from 734 million years ago along with the peralkaline granites of the Crossnore Complex and bimodal volcanic rocks atop the crystalline basement point to the rifting of the proto-North American continent Laurentia. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Neoproterozoic rifting formed the Iapetus Ocean and the Cambrian Unicoi Formation and Chillhowee Group, from the early Paleozoic show a transition from terrestrial sandstone to marine sedimentary rocks. Small volcanic island arcs and pieces of oceanic crust, collectively known as terranes, accreted onto the edge of Laurentia with the shifting of the Iapetus, Rheic and Theic ocean basins. Folding, thrusting and compression resulted in a series of different mountain building events. The Taconic orogeny deformed and metamorphosed terranes in northwest North Carolina between 470 and 440 million years ago. The Salisbury and Concord Plutonic Suites formed 400 million years ago and may have been related to the Acadian orogeny in the Devonian. South of the Brevard fault zone, granitoid plutons formed during the Alleghanian orogeny which was the final phase in the buildup of the Appalachians. The orogeny produced amphibolite grade rocks on the sequence of metamorphic facies in the Raleigh and Kiokee metamorphic belts in the eastern Piedmont as well as near High Shoals Granite, introduced strike-slip faulting from the Brevard fault southeast to the Piedmont fault zone and produced the thrust sheets of the Blue Ridge and Piedmont. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= In the Mesozoic, rifting in the Triassic began to break apart the supercontinent Pangea which had assembled during the Alleghanian orogeny. Thinning of the crust produced diabase dikes in the early Jurassic 200 million years ago throughout the Piedmont, as well as felsic dikes and diabase sills in the Deep River Basin. Seismic data indicates that large basalt flows found offshore extend onshore, reaching Charleston, South Carolina. Few Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks are rare on the continental margin. More deeply buried crystalline basement rock that remains poorly understood underlies eastern North Carolina, although the present geology of the area at the surface is dominated entirely by the Atlantic coastal plain, which resulted from sediment eroded off the Appalachian Mountains that began to steadily form in the Cretaceous. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= The Atlantic coastal plain continued to build out to sea during the Cenozoic and the current sand, clay and gravel at surface on dry land and in rivers, lakes, and nearshore water all formed during the last 2.5 million years of the Quaternary. The Waccamaw Formation includes fossil bearing sands and formed between the Pliocene and the Pleistocene, in the southeasternmost part of North Carolina, south of Wilmington. The Comfort Member and New Hanover Member formed earlier and include bryozoan and echinoid fossils, skeletal limestone and phosphate pebble conglomerate. The smaller Riverbend Formation lies just to the east, running north and south from Jackson with a limestone unit and abuts the oyster shell mounds and clay sands of the Pollocksville Member. Rising up to 25 feet above sea level atop the Suffolk Scarp, Quaternary sediments comprise the Outer Banks and both the peninsulas and bottom of the water in and around Pamlico Sound and Albemarle Sound.

Different countries, states and jurisdictions have different laws ranging from complete prohibition to no laws at all, making online gambling de facto legal and unregulated. To determine whether a potential online gambler should be allowed to deposit, play or even view an online casino it is necessary to determine the individual's physical location. Online casinos and poker rooms have used geolocation in various ways over time. The first online casinos existed when few laws governed the internet (let alone online gambling), and players were simply asked to state their location. As laws regulating online gambling were passed, it became necessary to use technology to prove the physical location of players.  Technology  When the first hand of licensed and regulated online poker in the United States was dealt in Nevada on April 30, 2013 by UltimatePoker.com, the site relied on a combination of a player's IP address and GPS signal from their cellular phone. Many players experienced problems from this process that made it difficult or even impossible for them to be correctly geolocated in Nevada and prevented them from playing. Initially players located near the state's borders could not be geolocated with enough precision to allow them to pass the Nevada location check. People who did not have mobile phones could not play at all. As the industry expanded to the state of New Jersey, a new method of geolocation was deployed. This method triangulated wifi networks near the player to determine his or her physical location. This method was much more precise. Players reported fewer difficulties and even those located close to New Jersey's border could still correctly pass the geolocation check. In order to prevent players outside a regulated state from bypassing the geolocation test using VPNs, the software checks for VPN and remote access software running on the player's system. If any such software is detected, the player is not allowed to wager.  Applications  In 2018, Pennsylvania became the fourth US state to license and regulate the industry. One requirement in Pennsylvania is that online gambling is not permitted inside brick and mortar casinos. This presents the unique challenge of disallowing play in certain physical locations within a state in which online gambling is otherwise authorized. Additionally in 2018 the US Supreme Court found the national Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 to be unconstitutional, paving the way for states to authorize sports betting. Since mobile device sports betting is a popular pastime, more states are likely to require geolocation services.

He is commemorated by a tall monument at Curry Rivel, Somerset erected by William Pitt the Elder, to whom he left his entire fortune. Urchfont Manor in 2009 Pynsent was the eldest son of Sir William Pynsent, 1st Baronet MP of Urchfont, Wiltshire, and his wife Patience Bond, daughter of John Bond, alderman of London. He married Mary Star, widow of Edmund Star of New Court, and daughter of Thomas Jennings of Burton, Somerset. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1719. Pynsent acquired an estate at Burton through his wife, and after the general election of 1715 was returned on petition as a Whig Member of Parliament for Taunton on 30 August 1715. He voted for the septennial bill and the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts. He did not vote on the Peerage Bill, and thereafter did not attend the House. It was said he would give up his seat as soon as the Government provided him with an office of profit. This did not happen and he remained an MP until the end of the Parliament. Although he never stood again, he carried on playing a part in politics as he had an interest in parliamentary seats in Somerset. He was High Sheriff of Somerset for the year 1741 to 1742.

He left his whole fortune to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham who was no relation of his and whom he had never met. His will gave no reason for the bequest, merely observing: \\"I hope he will like my Burton estate, where I now live, well enough to make it his country seat\\".

The album was released digitally on January 13, 2017, through Lakeshore Records. It is the fifth film score composed by the duo. Background Reznor and Ross had composed three soundtracks for David Fincher which earned them widespread acclaim and an Academy Award for The Social Network (2010). For their next project they aimed to find something that \\"felt unfamiliar\\". Reznor told Deadline Hollywood \\"What lured us in was the challenge of seeing if we could try to color outside the lines a little bit of what music might be expected to do in a picture like that.\\" As part of the research for the soundtrack the two were given access to previously unreleased FBI files surrounding the events of the Boston Marathon bombing that the film was based on. Production Reznor and Ross composed the entire soundtrack together in the studio, with Reznor playing all the instruments and Ross handling the arrangements. They worked simultaneously on Nine Inch Nails's 2016 EP Not the Actual Events and The Vietnam War soundtrack (2017). Most of the piano and live strings were filtered through a specially built for the purpose device which consisted of \\"two tape machines hooked to a computer, where it just endlessly locks something in and copies from one to the next, each one degenerating another time. [...] Leave it overnight and it‚Äôs unrecognizable, but it does it in a way that‚Äôs interesting, that‚Äôs warm and nostalgic.\\" About 30 of these pieces were created and left to play for different amounts of time in order to \\"invoke the sense of memory or place\\" for the more emotional motifs. The more aggressive chase music was then built on top of that groundwork with each of the five film storylines having its own thematic basis. The sound of \\"a dentist scraping on a tooth\\" was sampled to create the propulsive rhythm of some scenes. For the minutes before the bombing, however, they decided to not employ direct tension but have Reznor play the piano in a way that creates \\"a sense of dread that‚Äôs building up\\". Reznor noted that unlike their previous experience of working on David Fincher's films who had their scores \\"more subtly woven into the DNA of the picture\\", Berg kept demanding \\"more music\\" from them in order to have a way to bridge film scenes. Ross wanted to avoid scoring the bombing with \\"thundering drums\\" like the ones heard in similar films of the genre. They also wanted to not \\"punish people too much\\" considering the subject matter and instead wanted to reflect \\"heartfelt sincerity and humanity.\\" Most of the picture was already filmed when the two signed on to do the score. However, Reznor found frustration in the fact that all new scenes kept getting added and old ones kept getting removed, which forced them to focus on composing \\"suites of themes that could interact with each other\\" and be easily changed according to the film changes. He told Collider, Track listing =Award FYC album= An alternate album For Your Consideration (FYC) was sent by CBS Films/Lionsgate to awarding bodies.

History  The barracks were built between 1909 and 1911 on behalf of the Ministry of Colonies as Education School for soldiers and Petty Officers of the KNIL to a design by architect Jos Limburg in the style of rationalism, and is named after Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin who laid the first stone himself. The Corps Colonial Reserve moved in 1911 from the Waal barracks in the Benedenstad to this barracks in Nijmegen-Oost on the corner of the Dommer van Poldersveldtweg and the Daalseweg. With the move almost all activities of the Colonial Reserve were accommodated in Nijmegen: recruitment and selection, training, the care of broadcasting and handling of the returned and health care for the sick and wounded. The care for disabled people took place at Bronbeek in Arnhem. After the Second World War the role of the barracks changed. The KNIL was officially dissolved on 26 July 1950. For the handling of the administration due to the demobilization of KNIL soldiers who were not included in Royal Netherlands Army, the 'KNIL Center Netherlands' was established. On March 14, 1951 the center was officially closed. Until 1953, colonial military cases were still being dealt with. In 1951 the complex, together with the nearby Krayenhoff Barracks and Snijders Barracks, was taken into use by the Air Force Instruction and Military Training School (LIMOS). In 1995 the army pushed off the barracks and the complex became an asylum seekers' center. The barracks have a monument status. The Military Hospital, which was a separate part of the barracks, was demolished in 1992. Some smaller buildings that were part of the hospital, such as the porter's house and the so-called octagonal low 'radio building', have been redesigned.http://jeoudekazernenu.nl/kazernes- m-r/prins%20hendrikkazerne/x-prins%20hendrik.htmlhttps://www.noviomagus.nl/Rx.php?Url=Vrij/PHKazerne/PHKazerneCat.html = International Four Days Marches Nijmegen = For the Colonial Reserve, located in the barracks, distance marts were of great importance. From 1912, space was made available as accommodation for the participants in a four-day walking event that Nijmegen visited. This was the origin of the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen. The barracks were from 1925 to 1946 the starting point and the finish of the tour. From 1928 to 1938 the Flag Parade, the official opening of the Four Days Marches of Nijmegen, was held in the barracks courtyard and adjacent Molenveld.  Building  The main building of the Prins Hendrik Barracks, in particular the middle part with the dome tower, has influenced Dutch architecture, for example the design for the main post office in Maastricht by Marinus Jan Granpr√© Moli√®re. It was probably also a source of inspiration for G.W. van Heukelom in his design for the Hoofdadministratie Building III (De Inktpot) of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (Utrecht 1918) and for G.C. Bremer and J.R. Print in their competition design for the Lower House (The Hague 1920). The Nieuwe Badkapel in Scheveningen shows clear similarities such as the Dome Towers. The architect Willem Dudok, who started his career at the Military engineering, regarded the Prins Hendrik Barracks as a rational modern art expression in military architecture . The 'Canteen for civilian personnel' belongs to the Prins Hendrikkazerne and was built in 1910 and in the same style of rationalism as the barracks and the Military Hospital.https://cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/522968http://www.gaypnt.demon.nl/straatnamen/D.html#De%20Limos Gallery File:Prins Hendrikkazerne facade met naam , hengstdal, Nijmegen.jpgFacade with name File:Voormalige 'Kantine voor het burgerpersoneel'.

He was one of the first friars to arrive at St. Michael's Mission in Navajo territory and acted as the longest-serving Father Superior of the mission from 1900 until his death in 1921.  Early life  Anselm Weber was born Anton Weber on November 10, 1862, at New Salem, Michigan. He studied as a child with Father W.A. Tilik in his hometown and eventually attended St. Francis College in Cincinnati, Ohio. Weber entered the Franciscan order as a novice on August 24, 1882, upon which his name was changed to Anselm. He was ordained by the Archbishop Elder of Cincinnati on December 28, 1889, and began teaching as a professor at St. Francis College. His health began to fail and in 1898 he was sent to St. Michael's Mission in Navajo territory in the hope that the Arizona climate would help him regain his health.  St. Michael's Mission: 1898-1921  St. Michael's Mission, where Anselm Weber spent a large portion of his life as the Father Superior from 1900-1921 St. Michael's Mission was the first Catholic mission to the Navajo in almost 150 years. The first mission was founded in 1627 by Franciscan Father Alonso de Benavides in a Tewa village called Santa Clara near the Rio Grande River. This was soon abandoned, and although there were other attempts to found Catholic Missions on Navajo land over the next century, the last such mission was abandoned in 1750. In 1896, with funds obtained from Mother Katharine Drexel, the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions purchased land near Fort Defiance in Arizona in order to build St. Michael's Mission. They invited the Franciscans to send friars to staff the mission, and the first three to arrive were Father Anselm Weber, Father Juvenal Schnorbus, and Brother Placidus Buerger in October 1898. When Father Juvenal left the mission in 1900, Father Anselm became the Father Superior at St. Michael's, and would remain so until his death. During his time at St. Michael's, Anselm Weber witnessed and participated in the mission's growth and interaction with the Navajo Nation. In 1903, the friars created a branch of the mission in Chin Lee, and in 1910 they created another branch in Lukachukai. During this time period, Weber concentrated on building relationships with Navajo leaders, establishing a boarding school, and translating Catholic materials into Navajo. He traveled often and widely throughout the area, and was able to form friendly relations with Navajo leaders such as Charlie Tso and Henry \\"Chee\\" Dodge who helped him gain support among the Navajo for the school. This boarding school, which was staffed by Mother Katharine Drexel's order of nuns, was opened on December 3, 1902, with 57 pupils attending. While it was met with some resistance from Navajo parents at first, and the number of students fluctuated through the years, the school expanded to 250 pupils by 1948. Weber never became as well-versed in the Navajo language as Father Berard Haile, but he, like his fellow priests at St. Michael's mission, emphasized the importance of Catholic missionaries learning Navajo in order to preach and communicate in the common language of the area. They believed that it was easier and more practical for the priests to learn Navajo and translate Catholicism into Navajo than to try to force English on the community. They also relied on the help of other Navajo religious leaders to translate Catholic religious ideas into more recognizable Navajo words. Because he was on friendly terms with both Navajo and US government leaders, Weber occasionally acted as a mediator between them. One example of this was his involvement in the Beautiful Mountain disturbance in 1913. When US agents arrested some Navajo women for polygamy, the women's husbands and families retaliated in what eventually turned into a skirmish with federal agents. As the situation between the Navajo and federal agents became increasingly tense, they both used Father Weber as a messenger and mediator. Eventually, Weber helped both groups meet and reach a compromise that prevented the situation from descending into all-out violence. Weber was also present during the Navajo influenza epidemic of 1918-1920. While he never caught the disease, he and Berard Haile went to different areas of the Navajo reservation to give last rites to Catholic members and assist priests who had become ill. Weber also imposed a quarantine on the school at St. Michael's which prevented any of the students there from catching the flu. Weber was most active in helping secure land rights for the Navajo from the US government. His involvement in finding land for St. Michael's mission in the early 1900s helped him gain a greater understanding of land law which he then used to lobby for more acres for the Navajo. In 1914 he wrote a pamphlet called The Navajo Indians: A Statement of Facts as a counterargument to those who argued that Navajo landholdings were too large and could be sold. He also accompanied various delegations to Washington D.C. to argue for land rights, petitioned surveyors who visited the reservation, and contacted railroad companies to obtain land. He wrote letters to railway company representatives, national government representatives, and other entities throughout his entire time at St. Michael's to help the Navajo avoid exploitation by prospectors and regain their land. By Weber's estimate, he was involved in the acquisition of 1.5 million acres for the Navajo. He continued working to secure land nearly up to his death, writing letters petitioning for land only a few days before he actually died.  Death  Anselm Weber was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1917. He remained at the Navajo reservation, but did go to hospitals for treatment and eventually had one kidney removed. His condition worsened until he was forced to remain at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He died there on March 8, 1921.  After death  Catholic priests, Native Americans, and other dignitaries sent their condolences for Anselm Weber's funeral. Indian Commissioner Cato Sells wrote: \\"I share with you and your associates at St. Michaels deep sorrow because of the passing of Father Weber. He wielded a large Christian influence and was a tried and true friend of the Navajo Indian.\\" Father Mandalari, a Jesuit in Albuquerque wrote: \\"The Church lost an apostolic missionary, and we priests and religious a comfort, a leader, a real friend. ...I cannot forget a Franciscan Father, whose friendship has done me so much spiritual good.\\" And Pablo Abeita from the Isleta Pueblo wrote: > We the Indians of the West, have lost a friend, a friend whom one and all > liked and loved. It is a loss that will take years to fill, if it is ever > filled. ...Others may take his place and do what Father Weber did and more, > but it will take years and years to open the Indians' confidence in their > hearts, same as they had for Father Weber.\\" Anselm Weber was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery in St. Bernard, Ohio. His colleagues Fathers Berard Haile, Marcellus Troester, and Leopold Ostermann remained at St. Michael's, with Troester succeeding Weber as Father Superior of the mission.

After converting to Christianity and becoming part of the Ghassanid-led tribal federates of the Byzantines in the late 6th century, the Bahra' were tasked with guarding the trade center and Arab Christian holy city of al-Rusafa. They were part of Byzantine‚ÄìArab coalitions against the nascent Arab Muslims in 629, 633 and 634 before ultimately converting to Islam after the Muslim conquest of Syria. In the following centuries they mostly inhabited central Syria, lending their name to the area's Jabal Bahra' range. History St. Sergius in Resafa, which the Bahra' tribe were in charge of protecting as tribal federates of the Byzantine Empire The general consensus is that the Bahra' belonged to the Quda'a, an Arab tribal confederation with Yemenite roots, though a minority of sources place them as part of another Yemenite tribal grouping, the Banu Judham.Bosworth, p. 938. According to Arab genealogical tradition, as chronicled by Ibn Abd Rabbih (d. 960), the tribe‚Äôs progenitor was a certain Bahra' ibn Amr ibn al-Haf ibn Quda‚Äôa.Ibn Rabbihi, p. 276. This tradition holds that Bahra' had five sons Ahwad, Qasit, Abada, Qasr and Adi, all of whose progeny became large clans of the tribe. There are scant records of the Bahra' tribe in the pre-Islamic era, but it is apparent that they were part of the Ghassanid-led Arab tribal federates of the Byzantine Empire in the Syrian Desert.Shahid 2002, p.118. The tribe is mentioned in a single verse of an Arabic poem from that era which has them based in Rusafa (Sergiopolis), a trading post between Syrian Palmyra and Mesopotamian Sura that also contained a shrine dedicated to St. Sergius; the latter was venerated by the Arab Christian federate tribes.Shahid 2002, pp. 118‚Äì119. The verse, recorded in the Al-Mufaddaliyyat, read: ‚ÄúAnd as for Bahra', they are a group whose place we know. They have a path around al-Rusafa that is clear.‚ÄùShahid 2002, p. 116. It is not known when the Bahra' converted to Christianity but it was most likely when they entered Byzantium‚Äôs service and allied with the Christian Ghassanid leaders of the federates in the late 6th century. Their prior paganism is noted in a pre-Islamic poem in which they mocked the ‚ÄúChristian swords‚Äù of the Christian Taghlib tribe. According to historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth, they converted in circa 580, after the Tanukh and Taghlib, the Bahra's tribal neighbors in the middle Euphrates. Historian Irfan Shahid stipulates that the Bahra' were in charge of protecting Rusafa and the trade routes running through it from non-federate Bedouin tribes and the Lakhmids, guarding the pilgrimage shrine of St. Sergius, and possibly facilitating supplies to the town.Shahid 2002, p. 119. The Bahra' were among the Arab federate tribes in the Byzantine army of Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of Mu'tah in 629 in which the latter defeated the newly ascendant Muslim Arabs. In 633, the Bahra' and Byzantium's allied Arab tribes were mobilized to combat the Arab Muslim forces of Khalid ibn al-Walid at the Battle of Dumat al-Jandal but were defeated. The Bahra' fought once more in the Byzantine‚ÄìArab Christian coalition against the Muslims in 634. However, following the Muslim conquest of Syria (634‚Äì638), they converted to Islam. They ultimately migrated west to the plains of the Homs region. The 9th-century geographer al-Ya'qubi noted that the Bahra' and Tanukh tribes predominated in Hama.Shahid 1984, p. 407. By the time the Arab ruler Sayf al-Dawla formed his emirate in northern Syria in the 10th century, the abode of the Bahra' lay in the mountainous coastal region between Latakia and Tripoli.Bianquis 1997, p. 106. From around that time, the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range became known as the \\"Jabal Bahra'\\" after the tribe.Salibi 2005, p. 89.

Also known as Eyes of a Lagos Boy, with more than a decade of experience in documenting history, looking for beauty where it is least expected. Bolaji Alonge's visual language speaks of the wonders of nature and human exchange and searches for historical continuity in a world that is fractured. His lens exposes contrast and conflict, while offering an alternative vision of oneness, order in chaos. He is also a globetrotter who has travelled around the world during the last decade documenting exotic culture and history.  Personal life  Bolaji Alonge was born in 1977. His father passed on his passion for photography to Bolaji, who spent time with him taking and developing images as a child. After high school, he studied Mass Communication at the University of Lagos in the rowdy nineties, while exploring his acting skills at the Theatre 15 UNILAG. Ever since he has acted in a range of theatre, television and movie projects. He is an atheist and considers that religion is a barrier to critical thinking. On 24 November 2018, Bolaji married his Belgian fianc√© Sandra Vermuyten in a civil ceremony at the Registry of Victoria Island, Lagos. Guests from all over the world got to the reception in a cavalcade of twenty tricycles. The photos of the wedding went viral.  Work  He shows his beloved Lagos from unexpected angles, a city that inspires and captivates imagination, but also pulls people into a vortex of energy and constant challenges. Images of everyday life in Nigeria carry deep social messages that expose fragility, audacity but also squalor. Bolaji makes the viewer reconsider what we have seen with our own eyes, through the Eyes of a Lagos Boy. Alonge's experience and his travels made him a great storyteller who loves to share his photography and the deeper meaning of the stunning images he presents. In May 2017, Bolaji organized his \\"Eyes of a Lagos Boy\\" photo exhibition at Freedom Park in Lagos. His second solo exhibition \\"Urban Culture ‚Äì Historical Continuity\\" was held at One Draw Gallery, Ikoyi, Lagos in November 2018. In February 2019, Bolaji showcased his work at Baza Studio in New York. A third solo exhibition, \\"Black & White\\" was held at Quintessence, Lagos in July 2019. He presented \\"Afrobeat: The Legacy‚Äù at Freedom Park in Lagos during Felabration 2019, dedicated to Femi Anikulapo- Kuti, Fela Kuti's eldest son and strongest proponent of Afrobeat. Bolaji also works on social and documentary projects, such as a campaign on the human right to water, a pilot study on Lagos Coastal Health that documented the health challenges of more than 145 communities inhabiting the stretch of Lagos lagoon and \\"Silent Majority\\" a creative art/photography workshop for street orphans, the socially deprived or displaced and teenagers in juvenile detention or correctional facilities. He is a passionate deep sea-diver and activist for ecological justice. Bolaji Alonge joined Music in Africa as the Regional Editor for West Africa in August 2019. Music In Africa is the largest resource for information and exchange in and for the African music sector. From March 2020, he is fully dedicated to the Eyes of a Lagos Boy project. Since 2016, www.eyesofalagosboy.com has developed from a personal blog to a news platform with a focus on culture and lifestyle, from the African perspective. The website is indexed on Google and has generated several viral stories in 2020. Bolaji also publishes regularly in national media.

The novel centers upon a metal guitarist who discovers that her soul was sold by a former bandmate in order to achieve success. Synopsis Kris is a downtrodden woman barely making a living by working at a Best Western. She wasn't always like this, as back in the nineties she was a guitarist for the heavy metal band D√ºrt W√ºrk. The band was steadily growing in popularity and seemed like it was just about to make it to the big time when the band's lead singer Terry Hunt left to become a solo artist, leaving his former friends behind. Kris's unhappiness and anger grows when she discovers that Terry sold her soul for his success. Determined to confront the person who left her with nothing, Kris decides to travel to Las Vegas to confront Terry. Reception Critical reception has been mostly positive.

Despite a structural weakness that prevented inverted flight, a small batch of CW 7s were used by several aeroclubs until the start of World War II. Design and development In the mid-1930s interest in glider aerobatics was growing in Polish aeroclubs, leading to an official requirement for an aircraft specifically designed for the task. Two gliders resulted, the Sok√≥l from Antoni Kocjan and Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski's CW 7. The latter, like all but one of his earlier glider designs, was built in the workshops of ZASPL, the Aviation Association of Students of the Lw√≥w Technical University. The CW 7 was an all- wood aircraft with a high, two-part wing built around twin spars. In plan the wing was rectangular out to long semi-elliptical tips. It was braced with parallel pairs of airfoil-section struts from the lower fuselage to the spars. The upper surfaces were plywood covered to the rear spar across the whole span. Between the fuselage and the struts the lower wing surfaces were also ply covered to the rear spar but beyond the struts only to the forward spar. Elsewhere, top and bottom, the wing was fabric covered. The fuselage was an oval section, ply-covered semi-monocoque with an open cockpit ahead of the wing leading edge. It tapered aft to the empennage which was wire-braced, with fixed surfaces covered with ply and control surfaces which were largely fabric covered apart from ply tips. The CW 7's small fin carried a full, rounded, balanced rudder; its tailplane was mounted near the base of the fin and had split elevators. The glider landed on a pneumatically-sprung skid. Operational history The first, airtowed, flight of the CW 7 was made on December 1934 at Lw√≥w-Skni≈Ç√≥w, piloted by Michal Blaicher. Encouraging flight trials, including full aerobatic programmes, showed good handling and manoeuvrability and led to an order from LOPP for about ten examples. In use several CW 7s experienced structural failures while performing aerobatics. These failures revealed a structural design weakness under the loads of inverted flight but, with a ban on any inverted manoeuvres, the glider remained in aerobatic use with various aeroclubs until the outbreak of World War II.

It is a simple version of the Bavarian national game of Schafkopf that is played especially in Franconia (northern Bavaria) and often for beer. The game is popular enough for regular tournaments to be held.  Overview  The rules of Bierkopf are similar to those of its more widely known cousin, Schafkopf, but simpler. Bierkopf is always played by four players organised into two permanent teams of two; the partners sit opposite one another. The positions taken by the players before the start are decided with the aid of the cards used for the game. The game is mainly played in the Franconian part of Bavaria and is sufficiently well known for tournaments to be helde.g. see Bierkopfturnier der √∂rtlichen Vereine, anl√§sslich der 5 Jahresfeier der Teufel at www.feuerwehr-steinwiesen.de and des FCN-Fanclubs mit wertvollen Preisen at fcn-fanclub-tettau.mein-verein.de.

Retrieved 7 Oct 2018  Aim  Bierkopf is a point-trick game, so the aim is to win as many card points as possible through taking tricks.  Cards  A Bavarian pattern, German-suited pack is used. From the usual 36-card Schafkopf pack, the Nines, Eights, Sevens and Sixes (the 'Nixers') are removed. In some regions, the Nines are retained and this is referred to as 'long Bierkopf' (langer Bierkopf). Unlike Schafkopf, in Bierkopf the ranking of trumps is always the same: the 4 Obers, the 4 Unters and then the 3 remaining Heart cards. The trumps, from highest to lowest are: * O ‚Äì Ober of Acorns (Eichelober), the \\"Old Man\\" (der Alte) * O ‚Äì Ober of Leaves (Blattober), the \\"Blue Man\\" (der Blaue) * O ‚Äì Ober of Hearts (Herzober), the \\"Red Man\\" (der Rote) * O ‚Äì Ober of Bells (Schellober), the \\"Ball\\" (der Bogel) * U ‚Äì Unter of Acorns (Eichelunter) * U ‚Äì Ober of Leaves (Blattunter) * U ‚Äì Ober of Hearts (Herzunter) * U ‚Äì Ober of Bells (Schellunter) * A ‚Äì Sow/Ace of Hearts (Herzas) * 10 ‚Äì Ten of Hearts (Herzzehn) * K ‚Äì King of Hearts (Herzk√∂nig) The rank of cards in the plain suits is: Sow/Ace > Ten > King. The card values are as follows: * Sow = 11 points * Ten = 10 points * King = 4 points * Ober = 3 points * Unter = 2 points There are thus 120 points in play.  Playing  = Partners = The remaining 20 cards are shuffled and the dealer hands them round individually, face up, until a Sow (marked with an \\"A\\" and sometimes, misleadingly called an Ace) appears. That player stays where he is. The other three continue to receive cards until the second Sow turns up. The player with the second Sow is the partner of the player with the first Sow and, if necessary, moves places to sit opposite. The two players who did not receive Sows form the second partnership and take the remaining places at the card table (Kardeltisch). = Dealing = The player with the first Sow (there are other variants) now shuffles the cards and offers them to rearhand, the player to his right, to cut. Rearhand cuts as often as he wants to. The dealer then deals a packet of 3 cards and then a packet of 2 to each player, the cards being dealt in clockwise order and face down. = Bidding = Forehand, the player left of the dealer, briefly confers with his partner before play begins. They may not discuss which cards they have, but only how well they are able to help one other depending on whether they have a good hand, indifferent or poor hand. At this point they may announce a schuss or spritze which doubles the winnings. If they decide not to double, the opposing team may now confer. But they may only say whether they can help or not help. If either team announces spritze, the other team may announce a retoure after the 2nd card has been played to the table. This doubles the game value again. The retoure may be further raised and, theoretically, this may continue until the winnings would be enough to erase all the remaining lines on the beermat. If neither of the first two players calls a spritze, player 3 has the opportunity to raise the stakes with his partner. If he doesn't raise the stakes, the last player at the table makes an announcement in accordance with a Bierkopf 'code of honour'. This is declared with the words \\"weil mer hinter hocken\\" (\\"because I sit at the back\\") or \\"an anzer mach mer net\\" (\\"do not reply to me\\"), whereupon no retoures may be announced. Otherwise, after each doubling and after the second card has been played, retoures may be declared. = Trick-taking = Forehand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit (Farbzwang) if possible; failing that they must play a trump (Trumpfzwang) if they have one. If they have neither a card of the led suit nor a trump, they may throw in any card. The winner of the trick leads to the next one. Tricks are picked up by the winning team and placed face down on the table. Players may always look at their own tricks, but you can only ask to see the last trick of your opponents.  Scoring  A game is called a bollen and consists of 21 game points. At the start of the game, the teams each mark 21 lines (i.e.     etc.) on a spare beermat (Deckel) representing the game points to be won. The team that wins more than half the card points in each deal (i.e. more than 60) wins that particular hand and erases or cross out one of its lines. If the losers fail to reach 30 points, they are schneider and the winners may erase 2 lines. If the winners take all the tricks - known as schwarz - they may erase 3 lines. Usually, however, the stakes have been doubled by a so-called schuss or spritze and the winners may then erase 2, 4 or 6 lines respectively. If stakes have been quadrupled the game points that may be erased increase accordingly. As soon as a team has erased all 21 lines from its beermat, it has won the bollen. This means that the other team must pay for a Ma√ü (2 pints) of beer. To record this a mark is made on the losers' beermat.  In popular culture  In the crime thriller, Kontra, Re, und Tot, by Dieter Wirth, the crime scene is the Bierkopf card table in the local pub.

Born into a Protestant family from Savoie, Fran√ßois-Joseph Gamon was the son of Joseph Gamon and Anne Bosc. He studied law in Toulouse, then became a lawyer in the same city. He acquired a local fame as a result of his flamboyant rhetoric in court. French Revolution In 1791 Gamon was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the department of Ard√®che as the substitute Valadier. After Valadier's resignation, Gamon replaced him in the Assembly from January 3, 1792. His made no particular mark and generally voted with the moderate deputies. He was re-elected on 5 September 1792 to the National Convention with 319 out of 392 votes, and aligned himself more clearly with the Girondins. At the trial of Louis XVI, he asked that the accused be heard before the promulgation of the decree of accusation against him, and vote for death with conditions. He was one of deputies most hostile to the Montagnards and extremists of the Paris Commune. On March 10, 1793, he mounted the tribune of the Convention to denounce plots organized against the Girondins and reproached the Montagnards for filling the stands of the Assembly with their supporters. He thus attracted the hatred of Jean-Paul Marat. Initially spared by the Insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793, he fought vehemently against this coup by signing a petition of protest with 75 Girondin deputies. As a result he was soon named in a decree of accusation by the Convention. However he escaped the proscription inflicted on his fellow petitioners; at the moment when his decree of arrest striking him proceeded to the vote, he absented himself from the Convention claimed that he needed to use the toilet, and was able to flee from Paris to Switzerland. He remained there for eighteen months, during which time he got married. After the Thermidorean Reaction, Gamon was recalled to the Convention, where he supported the reactionary policies of the majority; the restitution of the property of those who had been condemned under the Great Terror and severe punishment for those responsible for the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III. He was even suspected of royalism after his name was discovered in the papers of an agent of the Comte de Provence named Lema√Ætre. He managed to exonerate himself, but it is possible he was in the pay of Provence. He joined the Committee of Public Safety on June 5, 1795, in charge of munitions. Under the Directory, five departments elected Gamon to the Council of Five Hundred, where he sat until the year VI among the moderates despite acquaintances with the royalists. Gamon was, according to one source, in the pay of the British government and was in contact with the royalist agent de Launay. Gamon then served on the Court of cassation, then judge at the Court of Appeal of N√Æmes after the Coup of 18 Brumaire. Under Napoleon and the Bourbons In 1804, he received the Legion d'Honneur and became president of the criminal court of Ard√®che. Two years later, he led a delegation from his department to congratulate Napoleon I, who appointed him general counselor of Ardeche in 1808, then president of the Court of Nimes in 1813. In 1812 he was elected to the Academy of Gard. Removed from office after the Bourbon Restoration, he returned to them under the Hundred Days. On May 11 1815, the district of Privas elected him to the House of Representatives by 32 votes out of 44 voters. During the session of this House he spoke only once after the battle of Waterloo, proposing the restoration of the Constitution of 1791, without indicating who he thought should take the Crown of France. Again removed from office with the return of the Bourbons, Gamon retired to his hometown until the law of 1816 banished the regicides from the kingdom. He fled to Switzerland, but managed to return to France in 1819 thanks to the protection of his friend Boissy d'Anglas. Literary works In 1795 he published three tragedies - Cleop√¢tre (1788), Charlotte Corday (1795) and Beaurepaire (1806), while two others, Tib√®re and Adonais, remained unpublished. In 1817 he published Les sept premiers livres du T√©l√©maque, a verse rendition of part of the famous novel Les Aventures de T√©l√©maque by Fran√ßois F√©nelon. He died in his native town in 1832 at the age of 65.

The formation is dated to the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, unconformably overlying the Crato Formation and unconformably overlain by the Romualdo Formation, formerly known as the Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation. The averaging thick Ipubi Formation comprises shales and sandstones in the lower section and evaporites in the upper part of the formation, deposited in a transgressive to highstand lacustrine environment in the Araripe rift basin. The Ipubi Formation contains little fossils, apart from an indeterminate Pelomedusoides turtle, but contains high levels of TOC and the formation is identified as a potential target for shale gas development.  Description  The Ipubi Formation was described as a member of the Santana Formation by Beurlen in 1971.Assine, 1992, p.291 Later revision of the stratigraphy elevated the members of the former Santana Formation to separate formations; Crato, Ipubi and Romualdo from base to top. The formations were subsequently included in the Santana Group, representing the middle part of the formerly described Araripe Group.Fabin et al., 2018, p.2050 = Basin history = The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Araripe Basin, located in the Borborema Geologic Province, encompasses four stages, with five tectonostratigraphic phases:Fabin et al., 2018, pp.2051-2052 1) Syneclise phase - Silurian to Devonian - characterized by tectonic quiescence in the Borborema Province. It is represented by the deposits of the Cariri Formation, that include medium to coarse-grained quartz sandstones, locally conglomeratic, deposited in large braided fluvial systems 2) Pre-rift phase - Tithonian - characterized by the mechanical subsidence due to lithosphere thinning that preceded the rift. It is represented by the Brejo Santo Formation, that comprises red shales and claystones, and the Miss√£o Velha Formation, constituted by medium to coarse-grained quartz-feldspathic sandstones, locally conglomeratic, that contains entire trunks and fragments of silicified wood (Dadoxilon benderi) conifer 3) Rift phase - Berriasian to Hauterivian - characterized by increasing mechanical subsidence that created a system of grabens and half grabens. It is represented by the Abaiara Formation, that includes shales, siltstones, sandstones and conglomerates 4) Post-Rift I phase - Aptian to Albian - characterized by thermal subsidence. The lowermost unit Barbalha Formation, represents a fluviolacustrine phase and is composed of red and gray shales, siltstones and claystones. The Santana Group was formed during this stage and comprises three stratigraphic units: * Crato Formation that is composed of six intervals of laminated limestones (C1 to C6), interbedded with calciferous siltstones and marls, and is very rich in fossils of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms * Ipubi Formation, that is mainly composed of organic-rich, black greenish bituminous shales, claystones and algal limestones that are interbedded with gypsum-anhydrite beds * Romualdo Formation, that represents a calciferous siliciclastic succession composed of fine to medium-grained sandstones, argillaceous siltstones, calciferous shales, and limestones, very rich in fossils. This formation recorded the marine proto-Atlantic incursion that involved the Araripe Basin, and other interior basins and created a large seaway throughout the Borborema Province during the Albian 5) Post-rift II phase - Albian to Cenomanian - characterized by a major sag phase, and is formed by two stratigraphic units: * Araripina Formation, that occurs in the western region of the basin and is composed by rhythmites and heterolithic layers of reddish, purplish and yellowish fine-grained sandstone and mudstone * Exu Formation, that comprises medium-to coarse grained sandstones, fine grained clayey sandstones and local conglomeratic beds = Lithologies and deposition = Lithological and core log of the Ipubi Formation Palynomorph associations showed that the lacustrine system evolved in an arid‚Äìsemiarid tropical area where the most characteristic flora consisted of conifers, Gnetales, Bennettitales and early angiosperms. The Ipubi Formation is characterized by containing abundant algal/bacterial- derived well-preserved organic matter. The pattern of organic matter accumulation and preservation corresponds well with cyclical paleoenvironmental changes (from anoxic to oxic bottom conditions and from a fresh to saline upper water layer), which affected the shallow lacustrine system. The deposition of thin, organic matter-rich mudstones probably occurred during higher water levels, which resulted in relatively low salinity waters and low detrital contribution to the inner lacustrine zones.Neumann et al., 2003, p.91 Data collected from outcrops and boreholes indicate that the Ipubi Formation is separated from the underlying Crato Formation and the overlying Romualdo Formation by regional unconformities in proximal domains. The lower unconformity separates the top of the Crato Formation, which is mainly represented by its uppermost interval of laminated limestones (C6), from the basal black shales and claystone deposits of the Ipubi Formation. These basal deposits formed due to the transgressive event that expanded the relative lake level beyond the previous extension of the Crato Formation over the adjacent basement areas. During the Ipubi transgression, anoxic conditions influenced the formation of basal black shales with high levels of TOC.Fabin et al., 2018, p.2067 The carbonaceous pyrobitumen shales of the Ipubi Formation occur as a layer in most of the mines in the region and have a potential for shale gas development.Neto et al., 2013, p.3 = Sequence stratigraphy = Schematic development of the depositional environments in the Araripe Basin Sequence stratigraphy of the Ipubi Formation with respect to the underlying and overlying units late Early Cretaceous (105 Ma) The deposition of the Ipubi Formation represents a transition from a transgressive systems tract to a maximum flooding surface. Six stages in the depositional cycle were described by Fabin et al. in 2018:Fabin et al., 2018, p.2065-2066 # Stage I - Pulsating expansion of the Araripe Lake during the post-rift phase created few depositional sequences, including the Crato Formation. There is no evidence of major relative lake level falls during the deposition of the Crato Formation, although the presence of stratigraphic levels recording the mass mortality of young specimens of fishes (Dastilbe elongatus) and halite pseudomorphs suggests that hydrological/biological conditions (eutrophication, salinity and oxygenation) may have experienced oscillations. The formation of halite pseudomorphs (hoppers) may indicate that minor relative lake level falls or severe climate periods occurred, although carbonate deposition continued. These oscillations may have intensified the dense-stratified effect of the water column, thus increasing the anoxic conditions in the deeper regions of the lake. # Stage II - At the end of the cycle that formed the Crato Formation, a major fall in the relative lake level caused the subaerial exposure of proximal regions. This caused an erosional process that affected the deposits of this unit. The lowest position of the relative lake level marks the maximum expression of the subaerial erosion and the first sequence boundary of the studied succession. # Stage III - A new relative lake level rise occurred and caused an important transgression over the proximal areas, including regions not previously covered by the basin domains. This event possibly caused the drowning of sedimentary sources. The balance of sedimentary influx and organic production influenced the establishment of anoxic conditions. Siliciclastic deposits, which are dominated by calciferous organic-rich black shales, were deposited above the unconformity of the top of the Crato Formation. These deposits mark the base of the Ipubi Formation. # Stage IV - After the transgressive pulse, the stagnation of the relative lake level established a high stand, under increasingly arid conditions, that led to the formation of isolated salinas or coastal sabkhas along the proximal regions. Increasing stagnation and small oscillations in the relative lake level possibly are the causes of the main phase of evaporites deposition of the Ipubi Formation. Most of the evaporite deposits formed under subaqueous conditions and are intercalated with fine-grained siliciclastic deposits. These isolated salinas or sabkhas may have been intermittently connected with the lake waters, which caused occasional interruptions in evaporite deposition. # Stage V - Another expressive relative lake level fall ended the deposition of siliciclastic-evaporitic succession in proximal regions. This forced regression exposed the proximal zones, and triggered the karstification processes of evaporite beds. The consequent erosion and reworking of evaporite deposits, and other lithologies, created a new sequence boundary that marks the upper limit of the Ipubi Formation. According to the biostratigraphic record obtained from boreholes across the basin, siliciclastic sedimentation continued within the depocenters, what indicates that the relative lake level was not completely depleted, and a correlative surface probably formed across distal regions. The karstification processes of the evaporite layers, created a ruiniform relief featuring escarpments, depressions and sinkholes. # Stage VI - A new transgressive event triggered by a new relative lake level rise created the depositional sequence that comprises the Romualdo Formation that overlies the Ipubi Formation. The marine influence on this transgression, that established a seaway in the interior of Northeast Brazil, is well documented by abundant occurrence of marine fossils (sharks and rays). This new transgression, that followed the erosion of evaporite beds, caused a renewed syndepositional karstification of these deposits. The new inundation caused syn-depositional variations in accommodation space due to the increase in dissolution and collapse of the upper evaporite bodies, as well as the syn- depositional deformation of the strata of the Romualdo Formation.  Fossil content  While the underlying Crato and overlying Romualdo Formations are particularly rich in fossils, comprising flora, fish, arthropods, insects, snakes, turtles, dinosaurs and pterosaurs,Aparecida et al., 2015, p.25Jorge de Lima et al., 2015, p.102Weishampel et al., 2004, pp.563-570Cavalcanti Duque & Franca Barreto, 2018, p.9Elgin & Frey, 2011Martill, 2007, p.895 the Ipubi Formation contains little fossil material. Fossils of a Pelomedusoides turtle were found in the formation. The material, archived as CPCA 3560, consists of crushed fragments of the skull, a partial lower jaw and the carapace. The fossil was described in 2011 by Ribeiro Oliveira et al., who were unable to definitively assign the specimen to a specific genus.Ribeiro Oliveira et al., 2011, p.62 The same specimen was mentioned by Fielding et al. in 2005 and reported as Araripemys.Pedra Branca Mine, Nova Olinda at Fossilworks.org  See also  * Ariri Formation * Itapecuru Formation  References  = Bibliography =       Category:Geologic formations of Brazil Category:Lower Cretaceous Series of South America Category:Cretaceous Brazil Category:Albian Stage Category:Aptian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Sandstone formations Category:Evaporite deposits Category:Lacustrine deposits Category:Fossiliferous stratigraphic units of South America Category:Paleontology in Brazil Category:Landforms of Cear√° Category:Landforms of Pernambuco Category:Landforms of Piau√≠ Category:Northeast Region, Brazil Category:Tupi‚ÄìGuarani languages ","title":"Ipubi Formation"},{"id":"58677038","text":"Russell Perry may refer to: * Russell Perry (politician) (1915‚Äì1981), civil servant, merchant and political figure on Prince Edward Island * Russell M.

Education  Atkin studied pharmacy at the University of London gaining a bachelor's degree in 1968. She studied public health at Columbia University, which she graduated in 1985 with a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree in 1984. She joined University College London for her graduate studies, where she researched the long-term risk of colorectal cancer following the removal of adenomas and was awarded a PhD in 1991.  Career and research Atkin joined the Colorectal Cancer Unit at Cancer Research UK in St Mark's Hospital, and was made deputy director in 1997. She was made a senior lecturer at Imperial College London in 1997, reader in 2000 and professor in 2004. From 1994 she worked with Jane Wardle on a trial of flexible sigmoidoscopy that included endoscopic examination of the colon, reporting that 40% of colorectal cancers could be prevented by this intervention. She compared the screening to a Faecal occult blood (FOB) test. In 2008 she moved to St Mary's Hospital, London, where she established the Cancer Screening and Prevention Research Group. The group researches bowel cancer and, ultimately, aims to reduce the number of people who die from the disease. Their 2010 paper outlining the results of the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial was the most frequently cited paper in The Lancet that year. The landmark study was a randomised controlled trial of almost 400,000 adults across 14 areas in the UK. If there were any polyps, people were referred for a colonoscopy. The strategy was rolled out by the UK National Screening Committee in 2011 and was expected to achieved complete population coverage in 2016. This was achieved with a ¬£60 million investment from the UK government. It's estimated to prevent 5,000 cancer diagnoses and 3,000 deaths a year. They found an increased risk in bowel polyps from eating red meat. They examined the incidence and mortality for the following 17 years, finding that people involved in the screening had a 41% lower mortality. The bowel cancer screening test BowelScope can prevent 35% of bowel cancers. Atkin went on to create a Special Interest Group (SIG) on Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists 1 (SIGGAR1), which analysed the effectiveness of virtual colonoscopy. They found it was less invasive and more effective at finding precancerous polyps and bowel cancer. She researched the optimum timing of surveillance strategies for people who were at high risk of bowl cancer. Atkin established a patient-friendly process that would invite, screen and follow-up the whole population. She found that patients at risk of developing bowel cancer benefitted significantly from a follow-up colonoscopy. She served as an expert advisor for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines for Colonoscopic Surveillance. She served on several advisory committees and boards. She retired from Imperial College London in August 2018 and was made Emeritus Professor. She died on 2 October 2018. = Awards and honours= * 2015 Elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) * 2013 Appointed Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to Bowel Cancer Prevention in the 2013 Birthday Honours. * 2012 Awarded the Bengt Ihre Medal by the Swedish Society of Medicine * 2011 Awarded the President's Medal by the British Society of Gastroenterologists  References  Category:Women epidemiologists Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health alumni Category:Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:2018 deaths Category:1947 births Category:British epidemiologists ","title":"Wendy Atkin"},{"id":"58677190","text":"Vijay Nagar is a major residential, industrial and commercial area in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.

The church is affiliated to the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. It was founded in 1896 by Fritz Ramseyer, a Swiss-born Basel missionary who was captured by the Asante in 1869. The stone church house was built by the early Basel missionaries led by the technical staff member and building technologist, Fritz Ramseyer as well as the missionary-architect, Karl Epting in 1907. Liturgy is conducted in English and the Asante Twi language.  History  Side view of the chapel The church's founding can traced to June 1869 when the Basel missionary, the Rev. Fritz Augustus Ramseyer, his wife, Rosa, brother, Johannes and Thomas Owusu, a native Akan Christian convert were captured by the Adubofour-led army of the Asante Kingdom. After half-a-decade of failed negotiations to secure their release, the British colonial authorities invaded Kumasi and freed the four political prisoners. Ramseyer desired to return to Kumasi as a Christian missionary. In 1896, the British colonial authorities invaded Kumasi again and detained the Asantehene, Otumfuo Agyemang Prempeh I, the Queen mother and royal courtiers, taking them as hostages to Elmina on the coast and then to the Seychelles. Shortly thereafter, Fritz Ramseyer returned to Kumasi as a missionary, twenty- two years after his release. Ramseyer purchased land in the suburb of Bantama near the current site of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital with the assistance of Thomas Owusu. After one year, Ramseyer and his team had established two mission stations and two schools. The British military conquest of Kumasi that preceded the founding of the mission station there made the project unpopular among the natives as they viewed the Christian missionaries as colonial agents and Christians as the ‚Äúreligion of the victor‚Äù. By 1900, by the end of the last Anglo-Ashanti war led by Yaa Asantewaa, the Queenmother of Ejisu, Ramseyer and the Basel Mission had set up 16 schools in Kumasi with a total enrollment of 311 pupils. Furthermore, 33 baptisms had been recorded and 160 converts lived in the Christian village. Shortly after the end of 1900 war, Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer returned to Europe to recover from post-war trauma. Ramseyer returned to the Gold Coast on 13 December 1901 and led efforts to reorganize the church even though this was opposed by the Basel Mission's Home Committee in Switzerland. The construction of the chapel and minister's conference was in 1907, with communal labour offered by the church's congregation composed of mostly African converts. After the chapel building was completed, it was named the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church. Upon the death of Ramseyer on 6 August 1914, the church leadership under the then moderator, the Rev. C. E. Martinson renamed the church, the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church in Fritz Ramseyer's memory. In 1938, a healing and prayer fellowship was started at the church in conjunction with congregants from the Assemblies of God.  Mission  The mission of the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church is based on the Great Commission by Jesus Christ as narrated in Mark 16:15: ‚ÄúGo ye into the world and preach the good news to all creation‚Äù which also aligns with the missionary zeal with which the Ramseyers pursued the propagation of the Gospel through evangelism and outreach initiatives.  Facilities  The church has built a new state of the art cathedral with a seating capacity of 3,000. It also owns an 18-unit two-storey primary school block comprising 12 classrooms, an information, communications and technology (ICT) centre, a library, an office and a multi-purpose hall.  Church hierarchy and groups  The church has a district minister and associate ministers. It has many partnerships with non-profits which have resulted in the establishment of schools including the Reginald Latimer Vocational/Senior High School, the Ramseyer Vocational Institute and the Adumasa Link Project. The following are specialized groups within the church: * Women's Fellowship: The group was started in 1937 by Felicia Afriyie and assisted by Jemima Ampofo, Kra Yaa, Mary Pokuaa, Yaa Sunguro, Elizabeth Santuo Anane and Christiana Bour, who were also the first elected officers. In 1939, the fellowship was formally inaugurated by the Rev. M. A. Obeng, then the Presbytery Chairman, District or Local Minister. The aim of the group was to spearhead the Christian women's ministry in areas relating to Biblical studies, needlework, the crafts, music and evangelism. In the early days, lessons took place at the Basel Mission House in Adum, Kumasi and was led the wives of the Basel missionaries. Today, the fellowship also teaches home science especially cookery, home management, health issues, marriage counselling, financial management and child training. The fellowship has also established a canteen and a nursery school for the church. * Men's Fellowship: This group was founded on 26 January 1970 by the Rev. F.W.K Akuffo with 25 members and nine executives. Akuffo was the father of Sophia Akuffo, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ghana. Other founding members were James Owusu (later the Krapahene, a sub-chief), J.M Oppong and J.K. Tawiah. The objective of the fellowship is to mobilise male members of the church to complement the work of the Women's Fellowship. The Men's Fellowship has led efforts in auction initiatives including the periodic ‚ÄúBring and Buy‚Äù and donated a minivan to aid the church in its evangelism work. Seventy percent of male congregants belong to the fellowship. * Singing Band: The band was founded in 1923 by A. K. Adinkra with support from the then district minister, the Rev. C. E. Martinson. * Harmonics: The group was founded in 1976 by E. O. Mireku. Originally named the ‚ÄúSpecial Group Singers‚Äù, it was adopted as a formal church group in May 1979, with fifteen members led by G. A. Kuffour. The group has 35 members and an executive committee. * Young Adult Fellowship (YAF): An initiative of the youth pastors in the Asante Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, the 2005 General Assembly held at the KNUST adopted the Young Adult Fellowship as an official church group. The Implementation Committee was headed by the Rev. Benso Osafo Kantaka, the Director of CLAN. The YAF was officially inaugurated on 2 September 2007. The fellowship organises Bible studies, prayer meetings and other social programs. The group has a membership of 102, managed by a seven-member executive committee. * Young People's Guild: The YPG was established by A.M. Atkinson under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast in 1938. After establishing the first twenty branches, Atkinson arrived in Kumasi in 1941 to start the Kumasi Guild, a predecessor to the YPG with E. K. Hennor, Theodore Oppong and forty-nine pioneers. The YPG had been instrumental in church planting, credited with the opening of about 14 congregations within Kumasi and its environs including the Payer Memorial Presbyterian Church at Bantama. The YPG continues to be active be active in church planting, including new churches at Dominanse and Senfi. The group also organises excursions to tourist sites in the country. * Ramseyer Choral Singers/Trombone Choir: This group, originally called the ‚ÄúQuints Singers‚Äù, was established in the early 1960s. The initially focused on Negro Spirituals. The group became coed and changed its name to the Ramseyer Choral Singers. The founding members were Daniel Fei, P.A. Appiah-Fei, E. Y. Berko, Joseph Ameka, J. Manase Oppong Jnr. And Sam Dankwa. Until 1972, the group was not recognised an official group in the church as the use of drums was banned. The group's performance changed the church leadership at the Kyebi Synod in 1972. The ban on drumming within the church was lifted after that event the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church adopted the group into its fold. There are fifty members in the group ‚Äì 22 men and 28 women, overseen by an executive body. In the past, the group has performed at the Ghana National Cultural Centre and Europe - Austria, Switzerland, Germany and Holland. Many members are also in the main church choir. * Boys‚Äô and Girls‚Äô Brigade: The Brigade was started in 1962 by Yaw Koranteng Oppong. The first enrollment service was on 24 June 1962 and had 9 offices and 105 brigades. It was initially named the 4th and 2nd Kumasi Company of the Boys‚Äô and Girls‚Äô Brigade. The district minister is the chaplain of the group of 50 boys and 60 girls. * Bible Study and Prayer Group (BSPG): It was founded in the early 1930s by Sunday school teachers. Characterised by its charismatic/neo-Pentecostal approach to evangelism, it was opposed by the elders of the church who considered the practices un-Presbyterian. The group was accepted into the mainstream church after going through a training in Abetifi organised by the Rev. T. A. Kumi between 1962 and 1965. At the 37th Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, organised at the KNUST on 30 August 1966, the group became an official member of the church through the efforts of the Rev. S. R. Ntifofo. Founding members include Theodore Oppong and E.K. Hennor. The group has been an incubator for future Presbyterian ministers. The group also planted new churches in Ejisu-Asawasi, Besease, Essiemimpong, Feyiase, Akyaw Krom, Stadium Kyiransa and Brofoyedu among others. The group has 105 members -76 females and 29 males. * Restoration Voices: The group, formed in February 2003, is the Youth Ministry Choir of the Young People's Guild. The group aims to mobilise youth into the formation of song ministration and the training of instrumentalists. There are 45 members ‚Äì 25 females and 20 males. Restoration Voices was also instrumental in the formation of the youth choir at the Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Winneba. * Junior Youth: The group was inaugurated in 1984 at the Regional Conference held at the Ramseyer Church. The group is open to members between the ages of 12 and 18. Total membership stands at 150, with 85 males and 65 males. The executive leadership of the JY organises training programmes for the youth as part of a Christian education.

Ronda faced Butch Leal's Thunderbolt in the final of the 1964 Winternationals, and won, recording a pass of 11.78 seconds at .Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Favorite Race Car Ever voting: Early Door Cars/Roadsters\\", written 11 July 2008, at NHRA.com (retrieved 27 September 2018) He also took (\\" NHRA's national Top Stock crown that year, at the wheel of a 427 Fairlane. It was in the Thunderbolt, as part of the Bill Waters Ford Racing Team in 1964, that Ronda won Super Stock at the first Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races, in Riverside, California. He was also a member of the Ford factory drag racing team, running one of their 427-powered Fairlane Thunderbolts. Ronda was one of the top drivers of Fords in Super Stock, and in the early days of Funny Car. For the 1965 season, Ronda got a 427 SOHC (\\"Cammer\\") A/FX Mustang (with a four-speed manual transmission, which was capable of 10-second e.t.s. At the time, however, the Ramchargers, led by Jimmy Nix, were match racing injected nitro-burning altered-wheelbase Dodges, banned in A/FX, capable of eights, and they eclipsed the legal A/FX cars. That year, Ronda went to the Mr. Stock final at the 1965 AHRA World Championship at Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington, California, where he lost to fellow Ford Drag Racing Team member Dick Brannan; this earned Ronda US$700.Ultimateracinghistory (retrieved 6 October 2018) Ronda said, ‚ÄúOf all the cars I raced, the 1965 Mustang was the most fun to drive.‚Äù Ronda's new longer-wheelbase 1966 Mustang proved extremely quick, clocking E.T.'s into mid-eights. Then Ritchey, who played a significant part in Ronda's success, was killed in a racing accident at Fontana, California; Ronda pulled back on the car's setup and only ran nines for months afterward. After winning AHRA's Top Fuel Stock event at Lions (beating Hayden Proffitt and winning $1500Ultimateracinghistory (retrieved 6 October 2018)), Ronda graduated to Funny Car (then called A/FXBurgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"The Super Mustang\\", written 27 April 2018, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018)) full-time later in 1966. 60sfunnycars.com (retrieved 10 June 2017)), driving a Russ Davis Ford-sponsored C/FDPhoto at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) Ford Mustang.

Ronda made a brief return to Super Stock in 1968, when Ford introduced the 428 Cobra Jet Mustang, at the Winternats. In 1967, he got a new tube-frame Mustang, again owned by Davis, prepared by Holman Moody; Ronda painted it \\"poppy red\\", also.60sfunnycars.com (retrieved 10 June 2017) With a stock body, tilt front end, and working doors,60sfunnycars.com (retrieved 10 June 2017); Burgess, Phil. \\"Remembering Gas Ronda\\", Written 26 October 2017, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) it ran a best of 7.90 seconds at ,60sfunnycars.com (retrieved 10 June 2017) after Ronda added a supercharger toward year's end.

The injury provoked him to promise his father, who had never approved of him racing, he would quit. Ronda had a reputation for \\"being a tough racer but also a true gentleman racer\\".  After retirement  Ronda took a radically different tack after retiring from drag racing. Four years later, he opened the Funny Car Tavern, located in Azusa, California. In time, he moved to West Covina, establishing a nightclub called Ronda's Gas House, with three bars and two dance floors, right on Interstate 10 east of Azusa Ave. Over the following eighteen years, it kept Ronda so busy, he could not even attend races. Only in the 1990s did he have time to begin becoming involved again, at events like the NHRA Motorsports Museum Hot Rod Reunions, or the 2016 Winternats, where one of his early Funny Cars was on display by NHRA, celebrating 50 years of the class.  Off track  Ronda became a fan favorite among funny car drivers on the U.S. West Coast. When he started racing, Ronda's day job was as a dance instructor.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Favorite Race Car Ever voting: Early Door Cars/Roadsters\\", written 11 July 2008, at NHRA.com (retrieved 27 September 2018) Ronda made it a point to be well-dressed, even in the pits, which made him stand out. In 2014, Ronda suffered a stroke. In 2016, Ronda was made a member of the International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Ronda died of cancer on 25 October 2017. He was 91. Ronda was married to his wife Nina, and had two sons, Gaspar \\"Gas\\", Jr., and John, and a daughter, Tyline.

The Neolithic settlement is dated to the 5th millennium BC and was part of the Vinƒça culture. The research of the site began in 1962 and the locality was declared a cultural monument in 2014. The site gives an unprecedented possibility of researching the architecture and urbanism of the Vinƒça culture as it marks the previously unrecorded and unique settlement type of this cultural group. Taking in account its geographical position, a regular street-like layout of houses, close economic and, presumably, social connections with the surrounding contemporary settlements and beyond, the Crkvine settlement appears to be a \\"burgeoning proto-urban society\\", in the region bounded by three rivers, the Sava, Kolubara and Tamnava.  Location  Crkvine is located in the village of Stubline, which is part of the Obrenovac municipality, which in turn administratively belongs to Belgrade. It is southeast of its municipal seat of Obrenovac, and in the same direction from Belgrade. As of 2018, there are some 90 archaeological sites on the territory of the Obrenovac municipality, 13 of which are dated to the Neolithic. Crkvine is situated on a mild slope, bounded by the creeks of Izvorac and Trstenica. Today, the location is surrounded by cornfields as the modern Stubline village developed a bit further from it. The plateau on which the settlement was built is elevated from the surrounding areas, on the feature called Dren Elevation (Drenski vis). The locality is on the very edge of Dren Elevation, which itself is high and classified as a deluvial-proluvial plain. It is a secondary river terrace, remain of the old bank of the river Sava which long time ago flowed along the Dren Elevation before turning to the present, northern route. The plateau is long while it is wide on the western and on the eastern end. Despite the low elevation of the settlement locality, , numerous distant mountains are visible: Avala, Kosmaj, Rudnik, Suvobor, Maljen, Povlen and Cer, while on the clear days the Stolovi can be seen, too. This allowed an exceptional visual communication with the areas to the south and east but, not with the areas to the north and west, where other Neolithic settlements were located.  Name  The modern name of the locality, Crkvine, means the \\"church ground\\". It is based on the long-living myth that there was an old church on this spot. The legend was preserved from generation to generation and some writings from the 19th century seemingly confirm that there is an old church ground in Stubline. As the inhabitants believed in the story, for a long time the locality hasn't been cultivated. However, no remains of an actual church have been found so far.  History  Just like the surrounding areas, the Crkvine was settled by the members of the Vinƒça culture. Archaeologists praise the \\"good choosing of the living place\\" of the Vinƒçans. It is believed that the settlement wasn't formed by several families and then spontaneously settled by more and more migrants, but that it was rather settled by a large number of people at once. The older settlement dates from 4700 BC. It occupies the eastern plateau, with some 120 houses, which were protected by the deeply dug double trenches, which presumably offered protection from numerous hazards: enemies, wild animals, flash floods by the surged streams, etc. Some 50 years after it was founded, the settlement spread on the western side of the plateau where further 80 houses were built in time. After two centuries, the Vinƒçan communities in this area simply disappeared. It coincides with the vanishing of the entire Vinƒça culture c. 4600 BC. Though today much is known about the culture itself, the abrupt disappearance remains an enigma. Out of various theories, none is widely accepted.  Exploration  The first written records which deal with the subject date from 1912, when the oldest villagers of Stubline still claimed the \\"old church\\" legend, but also had certain ideas of some human occupation from \\"ancient\\" times. The records were made by the teacher from Obrenovac, Vitomir Radovanoviƒá, who was archiving them in the school collections in the Stubline school and in the Archaeological Museum in Obrenovac. After the museum was closed in 1961, several hundred artifacts were stored in the Belgrade City Museum. First artifacts originated from the damage done on the surface, by grave digging or land cultivation. During a small-scale archaeological survey conducted in 1962, the remains of the settlement were discovered. It was clear that the remains belong to the Vinƒça culture and that there was a potential for further exploration. The first proper archaeological exploration was conducted in 1967. It was headed by Jovan Todoroviƒá, a curator of the Belgrade City Museum. The exploration was on the small scale, and Todoroviƒá also explored the surrounding Neolithic localities, like Jasenje in Vukiƒáevica, ƒêuriƒáa Vinogradi in Grabovac and Novo Selo, also In Stubline. However, the archaeological surveys and exploration stopped in 1970. Works were continued with the tentative November 2006 excavation. Geomagnetic mapping and geo-electrical scanning were conducted from December 2007 to 2011. The mapping produced the pattern of almost entire settlement on an area of . Systematic archaeological exploration has continued since 2008. Of total area, the \\"urbanized\\" section covers . It was the first major mapping of this kind of any Late Vinƒça locality in the central Balkans. The northern section could not be mapped because of the vegetation and current village road. Also, as the area below the lowest point of the surrounding trench, , has been regularly flooded until several decades ago, this area was not surveyed either as no building activity was expected on such terrain. As of 2018, explored objects include 5 houses, a primary trench system and the landfill on the southern slope of the locality. Head of the research was Zoran Simiƒá. At first, the precise dating was not available and from the pottery which was discovered, its features, analogy with other settlements and materials dated by the Carbon-14 method, the existence of the Crkvine settlement was placed between 5250 BC and 4600 BC. This was later narrowed to 4800 BC ‚Äì 4600 BC. On 8 October 2014 the locality was officially declared an archaeological site and placed under the state protection.  Settlement  = Layout = It was a large, lowland-type Vinƒça settlement which belongs to the Late Neolithic, Phase D-2 of the Vinƒça culture. In total, the settlement had at least 218 houses. The houses were built in rows, forming something of a street-like map. Some of the houses were built around smaller open areas, most likely a communal, public spaces. The houses are mostly rectangular, built from the mud-covered wooden construction. It is estimated that such a house, without major restorations, could last from 40 to 100 years. Sizes of the houses varied from to , with the average size of . There are 5 houses smaller than and 9 larger than . This is the largest average house size in the Late Vinƒça period, except for the Divostin locality. The smallest houses are laid in opposite direction and it is believed that they were not used for dwelling being probably public storages, though the exact use is still unknown. The conservative figures estimate the population anywhere between 1,000 and 2,000 inhabitants. Calculating that 5 to 7 people lived in one house, the population might be from 1,250 to 1,750. If all houses were contemporary, and given the fact that it is not known how many houses had upper floors, some estimates go up to 2,300, 3,500 or 4,000 people. In the west, the hill on which is the settlement is separated from the ellipsoid, funnel-shaped depression which today covers an area of . The origin of the depression is unknown, but such depressions are almost regular features next to many Vinƒça settlements. It has been suggested that these pits develop as the settlers take materials needed for the construction of the village. Some 95% of the objects were built in the north-south direction, but several were oriented in the east-west line. One of such edifices, which was unearthed in 2018, covered an area of , and had three rooms and two furnaces. The evidence points to the fact that it was burned after it was abandoned which was a custom among the Vinƒçans. They were burning their houses whether to build another one on its place, to move on another location or simply to clear the space. However, several other theories have been suggested. They include the ritual burning, an accidental, local fire or an enemy attack. Taking into account the large area of the settlement, the largest surveyed from the Vinƒça period so far in Serbia, a fact that the houses were built at the same time in the compact rows and how the life was organized, Crkvine is more of a proto- urban town, rather than a village. = Houses = The houses surveyed in 2008 were built in the typical Vinƒça pattern. In the shallow and narrow foundation trenches, the wooden stakes were driven inside. The stakes had in diameter and were placed apart. They were then covered with the interwoven wattle and thin branches creating the skeleton of the house which was then covered with the mixture of clay, earth and chaff. The roofs were most likely a gable ones. The floors were made from the wooden rolls which were covered with the similar mixture as the walls. Sometimes the fragmented pottery was added to the floor mix. The houses mostly had only one room, but some had up to three. They had some kind of furniture and everyday, clay-made \\"apparatuses\\" of the day. They included the five-legged tables, small vessels for keeping the grains, pithoi and large mortars and pestles. In some of the houses the light wooden shelves, which fell off the walls, were discovered. The houses had furnaces and fireplaces, which were the central points of the household life. By 2014, two houses were fully explored. Each had two rooms, ovens for food preparation and heating, storage sections and, beside previously listed objects, had an altar, grinding stones, cooking dishes and bucraniums, the ox-shaped architectural ornaments made from unbaked earth. House 1/2010 The excavation of the House 1/2010 in 2010, however, showed a different type of architecture. Because of the preserved, identical plank impressions, either in collapsed walls or in situ, and the absence of daub fragments with wattle impressions, it was concluded that the house was built differently. Apparently, it was constructed of massive planks which were then covered with daub. This is atypical construction method for the Vinƒça period. The wall planks were massive and heavy and wood of such dimensions was never previously recorded in the Vinƒçan construction. Along with some other findings, this pointed to the massive roof as these walls are capable of bearing heavier loads than the plain wattle and daub walls. A group of holes on regular distance in the floor is identical to the feature found in Par»õa, Romania where they were explained as the holes for the sides of a ladder. This, and some other discoveries in Crkvine, tentatively point to the existence of upper floors in the houses, which the thicker plank walls could support. Some other houses from the Vinƒça period on other localities are known to had upper floors, like Uivar, Par»õa and Opovo. A naturally occurred crack split the remains of the house some time ago, which allowed for the archaeologists to check the construction of the floor in detail. The land for the future house was first scorched which formed a thin layer of reddish earth. The scorched ground was covered with the layer of yellow clay which was then stamped down. The yellow clay was then covered with the daub fragments which were reclaimed from some older, previously burned house. All of this was then covered with a clay coating. Some parts of the floor show two layers of clay. This also differs from the usual method of the day and shows the rationality and economizing of the inhabitants. It saved them time and resources as they didn't have to retrieve woods to make rolls and in the long-term heating of the house was easier. However, some objects within the house were not built on the floor. First, the oven was constructed directly onto the stamped clay layer. Then, the storage container had a foundation made of clay coated pottery fragments. And the pithos was \\"buried\\" into the ground, below the floor level. The oven itself was quite large, , with evident signs of several renovations, and is the largest oven found in the Late Vinƒça period in Serbia. The house has another, smaller oven. After the exploration of the house was finished, the remains were covered with geotextile fabric while all the elements above the floor level were furthermore protected with the sandbags. Then, the entire house was covered with the layer of sand, thick, on top of which the protective plastic net was spread. Finally, everything was covered with earth again. The conservation was done to preserve the locality until the proposed idea of making Crkvine a museum in the open is executed. = Public spaces = The public space areas, proto-squares, show a pattern of planning during the construction of the settlement. There are 10 of such \\"squares\\" and each is surrounded by 8 to 12 houses. The largest open space is , covering an area of . The alleys between the houses were narrow, . The houses had no yards, so apparently all the communal work had to be done on the \\"squares\\". Even by today standards, the structural plan of the settlement is considered good and rational. Compactly built houses in the central part are all in the same direction, while only in the outer sections, on the downhill sloped towards the trenches and creeks, the houses become scattered and differently oriented. The houses are built in parallel, proper 16 rows and grouped in the numbers of 5 to 12. The longer side of one house always faces the longer side of another house. It is believed that each cluster of houses around the \\"square\\" was inhabited by the members of one extended family and that settlement sprawled from those clusters. = Trenches = It is believed that the trenches were foundations for the protective, gated palisades. There are two rows of the trenches on the north side of the settlement, and one on the south. As they follow the routes of the creeks enhancing the natural protective features of the landscape, apart from protection from the wild animals, they probably served as a protection against some, to modern historiography yet unknown enemy. The widest sprawl of the settlement between two trenches, discovered so far, was . The remains of the trenches, being further from the houses when the settlement was burned, are damaged by fire to the lesser extent. No remains outside of the ditches have been found. However, the mapping shows existence of another double ditch which was buried under the central section of the settlement. It was probably built during the original settling and as the settlement grew and expanded, it was covered up and the houses were built on top of it. Existence of defensive trenches around the settlements was considered a rarity in the Vinƒça period. However, recent use of modern mapping and surveying technics showed that many settlements from this period had such trenches: Vinƒça itself, Uivar, Belovode, ƒêuriƒáa Vinogradi-Grabovac, etc.  Artifacts  = Figurines = Extension of the Vinƒça culture As of 2018, some 60 figurines were found. Of those, 43 are completely different from the figurines usually associated with the Vinƒça culture, while 42 are almost identical. Other small sculptures clearly represent human figures, but Crkvine figurines are stylized. They are cylindrical, without many marks on them, except the accentuated noses and representation of a miniature tool or a weapon on the shoulder. Out of 43 figurines, for 11 the matching shoulder tools have been found. They are high and there are several theories explaining their origin. They may show the members of the household or represent the entire population of the settlement. It has also been suggested that they symbolize the member of the foreign community which moved in the settlement or that, on the social level, it points to the first signs of social stratification. All of them were found in only one house, next to the furnace, and most likely marked the act of abandoning the house. The figurines are arranged in groups of 3 to 10, and the largest figurine in the group is always in the center. Except for these central specimen, the surfaces of the figurines were not additionally treated or coated. They were made from the rather poorly refined, locally obtained clay with no significant mixtures added. In contrast to the majority of other clay objects, neither the ground stone nor pulverized pottery was added to the clay. It appears as if they were produced carelessly, in great haste. The evidence of carelessness in obvious on the surface of the figurines, and experimental reproduction showed that one figurine could be produced in 5 moves for 60 to 90 seconds. The central, larger figurines are somewhat more meticulously produced. They have a spherically modeled heads and the round shoulders are properly sculptured. Their body resembles the typical shape of Vinƒça figurines and the front seems to represent some kind of stylish dress. The surface is coated with slip and much more carefully crafted. The miniature tools (or weapons), which were placed over the right shoulder where the hole is modeled on the figurines, were made with much more attention. Of those preserved, on closer inspection, it is believed that they represent various tools: hammer axes (in the Ploƒçnik style), pick axes, one has an elongated blade while some are spherical and may represent mallets or scepters. It is estimated that the figurines were assembled in groups just hours prior to the settlement being set on fire. This, with the hastiness in their production, leans towards the theory that the assemblages were ritual, that settlement was attacked by foreign population and that threat was imminent for some time before the fire engulfed the settlement. This obscures the knowledge of whether such arrangement was a regular occurrence, or was some ritual in the case of great need or emergency. Though Crkvine is unique in this matter, the arrangement of the figurines is somewhat similar to the one discovered in Divostin. It appears that the symbolism of the figure-tool object lays within the tools. While the figure is rather reduced and without detail, the tools are so meticulously done that they can clearly be identified as they are almost exact copies of the real objects. This also may point to the fully fledged division of labor and the development of vertical stratification in the society. Due to their appearance, the figurines were jokingly compared to the La Linea animated character or nicknamed the \\"clay army\\". = Tools = As only a small part of Crkvine was physically explored so far, the results concerning the tools are still considered preliminary. The stone tools were found in two stratigraphic units, fitting the final phase of the Vinƒça culture. In general, the tools don't show any major local specificities which would distinguish them from the other late Vinƒçan tools, or late Neolithic in general. They are almost a textbook examples of what the tool producing looked like in the final Vinƒçan phase. Distribution of the discovered tools, so as the presence of abrasive stone (grindstones, whetstones, pounders, quern- stones) and light white stone flakes, shows that the tools were carved in the houses. Ground-edge tools are rare in general, mostly in the form of adze and extremely rare examples of chisel. Frugality of the used stone resources and prominent use of the damaged tools points to the difficulties in obtaining the stone supplies as the sources became inaccessible. The reasons may include the diminished areal of the Vinƒça culture in its final phase, but also the growing use of metal tools. More than half of the findings are the un-retouched flakes and blades, while the retouched ones are of an average quality for the period. There is no evidence of unusual or unknown technology. There are some artifacts made of white or grayish-green chert. The material most probably came from the same source which was used by the population which inhabited the locality Kamenite Njive in Barajevo, also on Belgrade territory, and ≈†alitrena Cave in the village of Bre≈æƒëe, near Valjevo. Based on the found tools, the inhabitants probably mined stones from some quarries, but also used the materials from the greywacke deposits and the alluvium deposits. The raw materials were most likely exploited from the narrow, local area. Abundance of the \\"light white stone\\" artifacts doesn't match the materials used in other surrounding localities at the time: in Vinƒça itself they used magnesite, diatomite in Iliƒáa Brdo, tuff in another locality of the same name Crkvine, near Mali Borak, etc. It appears that each settlement exploited the materials available in their immediate vicinity. Though no metal was registered in Crkvine, it is assumed that by this time the inhabitants must have been acquainted with the existence of metal tools and that they used them, as represented by the small axes on the figurines' shoulders. Even in the Early Neolithic settlements, the ephemeral usage of small metal tools was recorded. If the settlers at Crkvine used the stone tools only as the cheaper, out-of- date replacements for the modern metal tools, it may explain the findings of the good quality grinding tools (probably used in the mechanical treatment of metal tools) but a careless attitude towards the stone tools (majority of which was un-retouched, un-grounded and half-finished, worn out, lots of pebble and chips thrown away on the dump site, etc.). = Other = Almost 50,000 whole or fragmented artifacts were found so far in Crkvine. They are made of baked clay, bones, horns and rocks. Numerous quartzite, chert and jasper pebbles were also found. They could not be associated with the stone tools, as there is no evidence which points to their usage in this production. Additionally, being small and naturally fractured, they are materials of low quality and not suitable for the tools. As they are all found on one place, it was concluded that it was a sort of a landfill, where the waste materials and by-products of tool and pottery making were deposited. There is a possibility that these rocks were crushed and added to clay in the ceramic production. The pottery found in Crkvine is indeed rich in finely grained quartzite. There are also numerous pottery fragments which can't be reconstructed into any vessels or objects.  Society  The society is considered to be egalitarian. The members probably differentiated by their knowledge, both in general sense or by the specific ritual knowledge. They closely cooperated with other nearby Neolithic settlements: Grabovac, Zveƒçka, Jasenje (Baljevac) and another Stubline locality, Novo Selo. However, some relics point to trade with distant settlements, up to away. The volcanic glass obsidian, originating from Hungary and Slovakia has been found, so as the seashells and snails from Greece, bowls from the valley of the Tisza river, etc. As Crkvine and the surrounding Neolithic settlements were compactly built, with relatively small distances between them and a population which corresponds to the modern number of inhabitants in the existing villages, the dwellers must had a well developed and sophisticated systems of division of resources (pastures, fields, water sources, hunting grounds, fishing zones). There was, of course, a necessary hierarchy. In the case of Crkvine there are three levels. First hierarchy is on the regional level. In this way, judging by its size, Crkvine probably domineered the surrounding settlements. The second level is on the settlement's rank. There are central houses, which fit in the rules of grouping and aligning around the squares, and there are suburban houses which do not follow that pattern. And there is the third level, concerning the population itself. Indirectly, they figurines point to certain hierarchy as they are always grouped, from 3 to 10, and the largest figurine in the group is always in the center. The latter may also point to the developed religious system of some kind. The distance between Crkvine and the neighboring settlements was: Jasenje - west; ≈†arena ƒåesma - northeast; Novo Selo - north; ƒêuriƒáa Vinogradi - northwest. In total, there are 9 sites from the same period within a distance of from Crkvine. The density of population by far surpasses the average estimated density in the Balkans in this period. Digging of trenches and ditches around the settlement and \\"urban planning\\" of the settlement itself shows that some joint, communal effort existed. This could be done only in two ways, as the forced labor or as a collaborative effort as a result of the sense of belonging to the society. Since there is no definite confirmation that the society in the Neolithic was stratified to such an extent that one group could force another group to do work for them, it is suggested that the society in Crkvine was tightly bonded in the family- extended family ties and then by the sense of belonging to the community on settlement level. However, the exact position of Crkvine as kind of a metropolis, compared to the other settlements as outer suburbs (a cell of the territorial organization), cannot be confirmed with certainty. Equally, it is not knowns if there existed some kind of \\"regional\\" belonging, despite a fact that 4 closer settlements vanished at the same time as Crkvine, which could mean that Crkvine had a major position in this supra-village society. The surrounding settlements were indeed much smaller in size () and the conclusion may be that they gravitated towards Crkvine.  Economy  As the surrounding terrain is fertile, arable land, the main branch of economy was agriculture. including husbandry. The Dren Elevation used to be surrounded by the marshy ponds and water canals, formed by all three rivers, but also by numerous smaller creeks and canals which are today dry, except for a few, like Izvorac, Trstenica and Vukiƒáevica. In the spring, when the waters would retreat, the fertile mud was left, covering the ground, acting like a natural fertilizer and making the plowing easier. The estimated area available to the population of the settlement includes or meadows and forests on the Dren Elevation, of arable land and numerous marshes and watercourses. All rivers and creek are rich in fish, so the fishery was probably also developed. Water springs are abundant in the area. Some of the marshes remained through the hole year, being rich in fish, birds and other animal life. Former local ponds of Velika Bara and Nurƒça, which survived up to the 1970s, are today merely draining canals. Also, at the time, the area was surrounded by the centennially old oak forests.  Later developments  After the locality was abandoned in c. 4600 BC, the area remained uninhabited for the next 1,200 years, when the Late Chalcolithic settlement developed in 3400 BC. That settlement also disappeared and the next human presence was recorded 4 millennia later. There are very few remains from the Late Chalcolithic period. After the collapse of Neolithic Crkvine, such large, architecturally planned and densely populated settlements did not develop in this area until the period of the Roman Empire. A burial site from the late 8th century was discovered in the vicinity of the locality. It was a young male, some 15 years old, who was buried in the usual Avar outfit, including the characteristic belt. There was a wooden bowl next to his feet. It is one of the rare Avar graves south of the Danube and Sava rivers. The layers dating from the Vinƒça period were disturbed by the necropolis which existed on the location in the 1600s‚Äì1700s. The existence of a cemetery may indirectly confirm that there was indeed a church in this area, though its exact location remains unknown. Also, the centuries of plowing of the terrain above the remains took its toll in damaging the remains.

The book received both positive reviews, crediting Crews with having assembled a coherent case against Freud's theories and therapeutic techniques, and more mixed evaluations, which criticized Crews for lacking objectivity. Summary Unauthorized Freud is a collection of critical articles about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. In addition to Crews, the contributors include the critic Stanley Fish, the historians David Stannard and Peter Swales, the philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro, the philosophers Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, Frank Cioffi, Barbara Von Eckardt, Ernest Gellner, and Adolf Gr√ºnbaum, the psychiatrist Joseph Wolpe, the psychoanalyst Rosemarie Sand, and the psychologists Malcolm Macmillan, Stanley Rachman, and Frank Sulloway. The remaining contributors are Allen Esterson, Fran√ßois Roustang, John Farrell, and Lavinia Edmunds. In his preface, Crews states that the book's purpose is to reevaluate Freud and examine psychoanalysis as a science and that it was composed primarily for \\"the general reader\\". Though writing that it shows psychoanalysis \\"to have been a mistake that grew into an imposture\\", he observes that it represents a range of different views, some more critical of Freud and psychoanalysis than others. Crews also writes that all of the features of recovered-memory therapy were pioneered by Freud, and that it is an example of the harmful influence of psychoanalysis. Sulloway's contributions are an extract from Freud, Biologist of the Mind (1979) and a subsequent article on Freud's case histories. The contribution from Gr√ºnbaum is an extract from The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984), while that of Macmillan is an extract from Freud Evaluated (1991). Publication history Unauthorized Freud was first published in 1998 by Viking Penguin. In 1999, it was published by Penguin Books. Reception Unauthorized Freud received positive reviews from Thomas T. Lewis in Magill Book Reviews and Edward T. Oakes in First Things, as well as from Publishers Weekly. The book received mixed reviews from Adam Bresnick in The Times Literary Supplement, Edward V. Stein in Pastoral Psychology, and Kurt Jacobsen in Psychoanalytic Studies. The book was also reviewed by Mary Carroll in Booklist, the English professor Mark Bauerlein in Skeptical Inquirer, the critic Carol Iannone in Telos, and the psychiatrist David Healy in The BMJ. Lewis described the selections included in the book as \\"impressive\\". He considered the most interesting contributions to be the \\"critical evaluations of Freud's case studies\\". He concluded that while some contributions were \\"unnecessarily polemical\\", they \\"add up to a devastating indictment of Freud's theories and therapeutic methods.\\" Oakes credited Crews with presenting a detailed case against Freud, writing that it \\"would convince all but the most doctrinaire Freudian\\", and with showing the links between psychoanalysis and the recovered memory movement. He believed that the contributions it contained made effective criticisms of Freud's use of \\"evidence gained in hypnosis and free association\\", his \\"rewriting of the history of the psychoanalytic movement\\", and \\"his lazy neurological assumption that infants have brains developed enough to sustain the emotional trauma he attributes to them\\". He described the work as \\"engrossing\\" and \\"absorbing and consistently well-argued\\". Publishers Weekly wrote that the essays included in the book presented a \\"formidable critique\\" of both Freudian theory and practice and Freud's major cases, and credited its contributors with presenting \\"compelling evidence that Freud habitually and greatly exaggerated his therapeutic successes\\" and with casting serious doubt on \\"confidence in free association as a curative tool to decipher the meaning of dreams or to reconstruct events from a patient's distant past.\\" While it wrote that the book overstated the case against Freud, it praised the work Crews did in editing it, concluding that he had shaped the selections into a \\"cohesive whole\\" and \\"put psychoanalysis squarely on the defensive.\\" Bresnick was unconvinced by the book's case against Freud, but nevertheless believed it had redeeming value. He praised the contribution by Swales. Stein described the book as a \\"devastatingly critical assault\\" on Freud and psychoanalysis and predicted that it would have a lasting impact. He credited its contributors with showing \\"the fragility of the classical case studies, the circularity of much of Freud's logic and the degree of Freud's identification with favorable outcomes.\\" However, he wrote that it was also malicious, lacking in objectivity, uneven in quality, and showed a lack of appreciation for the opposition Freud had to face and insensitivity toward Freud's inner conflicts. He also observed that only a minority of the contributors had a professional background in psychology of therapy. Jacobsen believed that some of the essays made legitimate criticisms of psychoanalysis. However, he criticized Crews for lacking objectivity and fair-mindedness and rejected his claim that Freud was responsible for the \\"repressed memory movement.\\" See also * Freud and Philosophy References =Bibliography= ;Books   * ;Journals      Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about Sigmund Freud Category:Books by Frederick Crews Category:English-language books Category:Viking Press books ","title":"Unauthorized Freud"},{"id":"58677361","text":"Mathukumilli Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Murthi (3 July 1938 ‚Äì 1 October 2018) was an Indian politician.

They are the second most-internationally touring metal band from Russia. and the country's most known symphonic metal act. Imperial Age has collaborated on multiple occasions with musicians from Therion and Arkona who are featured on all Imperial Age albums. The band was brought to international attention by symphonic metal pioneer Christofer Johnsson,, who, after being impressed with their live performance and their cover of Therion's song To Mega Therion in 2014, offered to distribute their music through his label Adulruna Records. The name of the band has nothing to do with modern states and refers to Atlantis and Hyperborea, from which the musicians drive their inspiration. The lyrics deal with Magic (supernatural) and the occult, mainly Hermeticism, Hermetic Qabalah, Runic magic, paganism, bon and the legacy of Ancient civilisations such as Ancient Egypt, Sumer and Mesoamerican civilisations.  History  On 20 November 2012 the band released their debut full-length album Turn The Sun Off!, recorded with many known Russian musicians (Arkona, Epidemia, Stigmatic Chorus, Demons of Guillotine etc.) and received many positive reviews from critics internationally. Initially Aor was the lead singer while Jane played keyboards and did the backing vocals. In 2013 they toured in Russia as headliners as well as support acts for Epica, Paradise Lost, Finntroll and Oomph! . In 2014 Alexander and Jane embarked on a monthly expedition to Tibet where they filmed a music video for the song Aryavarta at Lake Manasarovar, Mount Everest and Mount Kailash - at altitudes up to 6000 metres above sea level. Same year, the band continued domestic touring, both as headliners and support act for Tarja Turunen, The 69 Eyes, Tristania and Therion. The latter turned out to be the turning point in their careers. While Imperial Age were playing in front of Therion in St. Petersburg, Christofer Johnsson was siting behind the scenes during the whole set, listening. He was so impressed that he offered the Russians to release their albums through his label Adulruna Records and join Therion on a big European tour. The musicians have been good friends ever since. Their EP Warrior Race was released in Europe via Adulruna on 1 January 2016. The record included 3 new songs, a Therion cover (which Christofer called \\"the best Therion cover\\" he had ever heard ) and 5 songs from the first album re-recorded with a new lead singer - Alexandra Sidorova. A European tour of 21 concerts in 13 countries as support for Therion followed in January - February 2016. After the tour Alexandra left the band for personal reasons and was replaced with Anna \\"Kiara\\" Moiseeva. After that, a second European tour of 18 concerts in 11 countries followed in November 2016 - this time as support for Orphaned Land. At the end of the tour Imperial Age successfully played their first headliner shows in Europe - in Manchester (UK). and Zaragoza (ES) Their second full-length album titled The Legacy of Atlantis was released on 1 February 2018. The album is a metal opera with various characters telling an occult story about a magician from Atlantis who is reborn in medieval Italy. Jane has left the keyboards to fully concentrate on singing, and the role of Cardinal Gregory was sung by Thomas Vikstr√∂m. Bass and rhythm guitars were recorded by Therion bassist Nalle Pahlsson, solo guitar - by Christian Vidal. The record was mixed and mastered by Sergei Lazar of Arkona. The opera features the P.I. Tchaikovsky Moscow State Concervatory Chamber Choir conducted by Taras Yasenkov. From January to April 2018 they embarked on their longest tour which included 59 concerts in 26 EU and non-EU countries - this time, as mid-act with Therion . The tour was also the biggest tour in Therion's career. The first edition of The Legacy of Atlantis didn't reach distribution in time because not enough copies were printed and they were completely sold out on tour. In June the band signed contract with Japanese label Rubicon Music for three releases in Japan. In January-March 2019 the band had a big European headliner tour and in December 2019 released the video on ‚ÄúThe Legacy of Atlantis‚Äù song, which was 100% funded by their fans and reached almost 1 million views in its first 4 months and beat 70% of music videos released in November & December 2019 by such giants as Nuclear Blast, Napalm Records, etc. On April, 25th 2020 IMPERIAL AGE streamed a 180-minute online concert from locked-down Moscow and achieved ground-breaking success with 14,000 people watching on YouTube and 24,000 views on Facebook. The band's global audience was streaming the live concert from all 7 continents, including Antarctica.  Discography  * Turn The Sun Off!

Ehrenberg believed that the bite wounds in the tamarisk plant created as the insects fed on the plant caused a sweet sticky substance known locally as \\"manna\\", and which Ehrenberg associated with the biblical manna, to flow out of the plant. In 1929, F. S. Bodenheimer found that the manna was in fact produced by the insects themselves, and argued that the description of the sticky substance and its geographical region argued in favor of Ehrenberg's identification with the biblical manna. The identification with biblical manna continues to appear in more recent literature. T. mannipara, like other mealybugs, is parasitic on plants, and in its excretions is a great deal of undigested material. In the case of mannipara, these excretions are high in sugar. In the United States, where tamarisks are invasive species, T. mannipara has been tested for possible use in controlling tamarisks.

Over the span of his career he appeared in 71 feature films and over a dozen television series. Biography Born Roy Lawrence Harris on March 20, 1914, in Fort Worth, Texas, his parents were Charlie Morris Harris and Mary Irene Bowers. He began acting under his real name with a small role in the 1937 film, The Firefly. By the beginning of the next decade he was getting significant roles in Hollywood westerns such as Law of the Range (1941), Men of the Timberland (1941), Rawhide Rangers (1941), Texas Trouble Shooters (1942), and Arizona Stage Coach (1942). Arizona Stage Coach would be the last picture he appeared in before, in 1942, his film career was interrupted by World War II, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army. It would also be the last film he would use his real name in. After being released from military service he took up the stage name of Riley Hill, and had a significant role in 1944's Ghost Guns. During the remainder of the 1940s he had significant roles in numerous films, including Flame of the West (1945), Sheriff of Cimarron (1945), Gun Smoke (1945), Border Bandits (1946), Under Arizona Skies (1946), The Haunted Mine (1946), Trigger Fingers (1946), Flashing Guns (1947), Code of the Saddle (1947), Range Renegades (1948), and The Rangers Ride (1948). He finished the decade with featured roles in seven films in 1949, including Shadows of the West, Across the Rio Grande, Range Justice, Law of the West, and Lawless Code. The 1950s saw Hill continue in major supporting roles, along with the occasional starring role in B westerns, as well as lesser roles. He had one of the starring roles in 1950's Law of the Panhandle, and significant roles that same year in Six Gun Mesa and Fence Riders. After 1951 his roles began to diminish, although he did have a significant supporting role in the 1952 western, Target, and 1953's White Lightning. With the advent of television, Hill began to transition to that medium. He appeared in The Lone Ranger, Dick Tracy, The Gene Autry Show, and The Range Rider during the early 1950s. He had the significant role of the apostle John in the 1952 series, The Living Bible. The remainder of the decade saw him continue to appear on television, mostly in westerns such as The Roy Rogers Show, The Cisco Kid, Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, and The Adventures of Kit Carson. His last significant part was in a recurring role in Mackenzie's Raiders during 1958‚Äì59. At some point in the early 1960s Hill moved to Tucson, Arizona. He only appeared in films which were shot in Arizona after this time. He had a significant role in The Trial of Billy Jack in 1974, and smaller roles in 1976's The Last Hard Men and several other films in the 1960s and 1970s. His last significant role, and second to last performance, was in When You Comin' Back, Red Ryder? (1979).

Early life and family Tottenham was the first son of his namesake Charles Tottenham and Catherine, daughter of Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1825 before, in 1833, marrying Isabella Catherine, daughter of Sir George Airey and Catherine n√©e Talbot, with whom he had three sons, including Charles George Tottenham, and two daughters. Political career Tottenham was first elected Tory MP for New Ross at the 1831 general election, following in the footsteps of his father and his uncle, Ponsonby Tottenham, who had been MPs for the seat between 1802 and 1805, and 1805 and 1806 respectively. At the 1831 election, it was his father's turn to nominate, and Tottenham was returned unopposed with the support of his father as well as County Wexford Whig MP Henry Lambert, who Tottenham had subscribed ¬£100 towards for the 1830 general election. At the time of his election, the local press assumed Tottenham had been sent to parliament for the \\"avowed purpose\\" of supporting the Grey Ministry's reform bill, which he later supported at its second reading. Shortly after, he resigned his seat, accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, a move blamed on his father wanting a \\"thorough-going Tory\\" in the seat. While Tottenham sought to return to Parliament for the same seat‚Äîstanding unsuccessfully at the 1835 general election‚Äîit was another 21 years before this happened. Between these times, he was High Sheriff of Wicklow in 1845 and 1846, and High Sheriff of Wexford in 1846 and 1847. Standing as a Conservative at a by-election in 1856‚Äîcaused by the resignation of Charles Gavan Duffy‚Äîhe held the seat until 1863 when he again resigned through the Chiltern Hundreds office in order to allow for his son, Charles George Tottenham to take the seat.

Located in the eight cardinal directions, they are a group of eight mountains or pillars which have been thought to hold up the sky. They are symbolically important as types of axis mundi and cosmology. Their functions in mythology ranged from pillars which functioned to hold apart the Earth and the Sky (or Heaven), as ladders allowing travel between the two, and as the location of various paradises or wonderland with associated magical people, plants, and animals. The Eight Pillars are a central aspect to Chinese mythology, and also have been used extensively in poetic allusion. Some variations exist, such as only having four pillars. Places Various mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars, including the eight mountain pillars themselves along with surrounding or intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. The eight mountain pillars include Kunlun, Jade Mountain, Mount Buzhou, and five more (Yang Lihui 2005: passim). Kunlun functions as a sort of ladder which could be used to travel between earth and Heaven. Accordingly, any person who succeeded in climbing up to the top of Kunlun would magically become an immortal spirit (Yang 2005: 160-162). =Buzhou Mountain= Buzhou was the defective mountain pillar. Having been damaged by Gonggong, it no longer separated the Earth and the Heaven for the proper distance. Bu-zhou was the northwest one (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 94-95, 135-136, 323). =Kunlun= Kunlun Mountain has been described in various texts, as well as being depicted in art. Sometimes Kunlun appears as a pillar of the sky (or earth), sometimes appearing as being composed of multiple tiers (Yang 2005: 160), with the commonality of \\"mystery, grandeur, or magnificence\\" being emphasized in the mythological descriptions. The base of the Kunlun Mountain is said to penetrate as far into the earth, as its above-ground part proceeds towards the sky (Christie1968: 74). As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru. Another historical development in the mythology of Kunlun, (again with Indian influence) was that rather than just being the source of the Yellow River, Kunlun began to be considered to be the source of four major rivers flowing to the four quarters of the compass (Christie 1968:74). =Jade Mountain= Another of the Eight Pillars was Jade Mountain. =Associated geography= Various other mythological geography is associated with the Eight Pillars. This includes the four rivers flowing from Kunlun Mountain and the Moving Sands. Activities Various activities took place at the eight pillars. For one, they were often thought of as reaching from Earth to Heaven; thus, climbing one of the pillars would allow one to reach Heaven from Earth. Inhabitants The eight mountain pillars were favorite places for all sorts of characters to visit or dwell. This includes various deities, immortals, and shamans. =Deities= Various deities inhabited or visited one or more of the eight mountain pillars. These include Xiwangmu and others on Kunlun. Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu) Although not originally located on Kunlun, but rather on a Jade Mountain neighboring to the north (and west of the Moving Sands), Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals (xian) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by Monkey King). Originally a plague deity with tiger teeth and leopard tail, she became a beautiful and well-mannered goddess responsible for guarding the herb of immortality (Christie 1968: 78-79). =Xian (Immortals)= The immortals, or xian, were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form). The xian were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon. Wu shamans The Wu or shamans were people that practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing, generally through the use of spirit flight. They generally seem to have become immortals. Poetry The Eight Pillars are a subject of poetic allusion from the ancient poems \\"Li Sao\\" and \\"Heavenly Questions\\" by Qu Yuan; and, on through later times, in Classical Chinese poetry. The immortals, or Xian, were Daoist immortals (humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form), which was presided over by Xiwangmu. The xian were often seen as temporary residents, who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon.

History In 1986, a task force was set up to complete the design of the Civic Center, including the use of Marshall Square, next to the main library at the time, for a new main library.125th Anniversary Timeline History of the San Francisco Public Library Construction on the current Main Library began on March 15, 1993, financed by a bond measure. The building was completed in 1995 and opened a year later on April 18, 1996. The old main library, which was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, was rebuilt as the new Asian Art Museum. At over and with six floors above ground and one below, the new library is more than twice as big as the building it replaced. The new library includes over 300 computer terminals, room for 1100 laptops, and a new wing for children. The city spent $104.5 million on the new library. Library visits doubled in its first year open, from 1.1 million to 2.1 million, and the number of library card holders nearly tripled. In October 1996 author Nicholson Baker wrote a critical article in The New Yorker about the weeding of books from the library as it moved to the new building. He was also critical about the elimination of the card catalog when the computerized catalog was introduced. Due to this negative publicity, the library released an official response to Nicholson's New Yorker article, criticizing his claims. There has also been criticism in the local press that the atrium significantly and deliberately reduced the amount of floor space available for shelving the library's collection which resulted in the destruction of over 200,000 books which were then buried in a landfill, gutting the research collections of one of the most important research facilities on the West Coast, all of which occurred away from public sight or review. Later, under intense pressure that included then Mayor Willie Brown, City Librarian Ken Dowlin whose policy it was to weed and subsequently destroy the books, was forced to resign in January 1997. The library was prominently used in the 1998 film City of Angels.

The species was named in honor of Mr. Carl Kuehner, a member of the board of directors of the U.S. National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. It is only known from the cloud forests of Sierra Madre del Sur of central Guerrero. It is phenotypically identical to the chesnut-capped brush finch (A. brunneinucha), which has a much wider range throughout the Americas and reaches its northern limit in central Mexico. However, genetic differences in mitochondrial DNA indicate a heavy divergence between A. kuehnerii and A. brunneinucha, and indicate that while both species look identical, the closest relative of A. kuehnerii is actually the green-striped brush finch (A. virenticeps), another Mexican endemic. The physical similarities between A. kuehnerii and A. brunneinucha despite the relation to A virenticeps are likely due to A. kuehnerii (but not A. virenticeps) retaining an ancestral phenotype similar to that of the A. brunneinucha species complex. The Guerrero brushfinch is not included on the online list of world birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee.

Born in the early 1450s, Jane was heiress to the manor of Morley in Derbyshire. Soon after the death of her first husband John Sacheverell at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, Jane was abducted by Henry Willoughby of Wollaton and forcibly married to his brother Richard. Jane was restored to her family, and her forced marriage annulled, after she petitioned Parliament for assistance. Her experience almost certainly triggered a change to the law in England to make abduction of a property- owning woman a felony. Later in life, Jane became the last Prioress of Markyate Priory before it was dissolved in 1536.  Life  Arms of the family of Statham or Stathum, later of Morley, in Derbyshire Jane Statham (also recorded as Joan Stathum) was heir to her father Henry Statham, lord of the manor of Morley in Derbyshire, who died on 30 April 1480. Her mother was Henry's first wife Anne Bothe or Booth, daughter of Thomas Booth, Lord of Barton. She was a niece of the lawyer and member of parliament Nicholas Statham. Jane was married firstly to John Sacheverell, a younger son of the family of Sacheverell of Hopwell. Their eldest son and heir, Henry, was born by 1475, and they had two other sons (Ralph and John) and five daughters.Inquisition Post Mortem of Ralph Saucheverell: Maskelyne and H. C. Maxwell Lyte, 'Inquisitions Post Mortem, Henry VII, Entries 401-450', in Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem: Series 2, Volume 1, Henry VII (London, 1898), pp. 171-190. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/inquis-post-mortem/series2-vol1/pp171-190 [accessed 6 October 2018]. John was killed on 22 August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth, fighting alongside Richard III in the last charge on Henry Tudor. A brass showing John, Jane and their children, and recording that John died fighting for Richard III, was installed about forty years after his death in Morley Church, and is one of very few memorials referring to the losing side at Bosworth. As a widow with an underage son in line to inherit estates from both sides of the family, Jane was betrothed very soon after her husband's death at Bosworth to William Zouche of Castle Eton and Hampton Meysey, a near neighbour and suitable stepfather for her son. Before the marriage could take place, on 11 November 1485, Jane was ambushed on a journey between Hopwell (home of her Sacheverell in-laws) and Morley by a party of 100 armed men led by Henry Willoughby of Wollaton, tied to one of the men on horseback and taken into Warwickshire. Her petition to Parliament records that she was menaced by Richard Willoughby, younger brother of her abductor, who '[did] his pleasure with her as his own will without that she well consent and be agreeable' [spelling modernised]. She was forced into marriage with Richard at some point in her imprisonment. The King intervened by appointing an arbitrator between the families (see below) and the marriage was able to be annulled. Jane and William Zouche were married by 18 May 1487. Following William Zouche's death, Jane entered religious life. She was prioress of Markyate Priory in Bedfordshire by 1508, and appears to have run the priory well, with no infractions reported during visitations. She was still the prioress at the time the priory was dissolved in 1536, and was still alive on 10 February 1537, when she received her first installment of her pension of 20 marks.'Houses of Benedictine nuns: The priory of Markyate', in A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 1 (London, 1904), pp. 358-361. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol1/pp358-361 [accessed 6 October 2018]. The manor of Morley passed to her Sacheverell heirs, and eventually to the Sitwell family.  Parliamentary petition and legal reform  A petition in Jane's name was sent to Henry VII's first Parliament in December of 1485. The petition probably did not come directly from Jane herself as she was still in her captors' hands. It sought an order that Jane be returned to Morley within six days of the order being made, that the Willoughbys be remanded without bail and tried for the alleged felonies of ravishment and robbery at the next session of the King's Bench, that they receive a felon's sentence if found guilty, and that Jane's right to sue for trespass, false imprisonment, robbery and rape also be preserved. As well as the remedies for Jane, the petition asks for the King as advised by Parliament to \\"[avoid and eschew] hereafter ... all such ravishment, robbery and riotous dealing of widows and other women\\" [spelling modernised]. On 2 February 1485/6, Henry and Richard Willoughby were required to keep the peace and put themselves under an independent arbiter. The result of the arbitration, given on 16 April 1486, was that Jane's \\"abominable pretended unlawful matrimony\\" to Richard Willoughby was to be dissolved on the basis of her precontract with William Zouche, and Richard and his mother Dame Margaret Leigh were to bear the costs. The Willoughbys were also required to pay 100 marks (¬£66 13s 4d) to William Zouche, Ralph Sacheverell (her father-in-law) and Jane. In return, Jane was to give up her right to sue once the compensation was paid. Henry and Richard Willoughby faced no other sanction for the abduction, and Henry continued to prosper under Henry VII, being knighted in 1487 at the Battle of Stoke. At the time of Jane's abduction, the law treated the abduction of a woman as an infringement of her family's property rights‚Äîa trespass‚Äîrather than an act of assault against the woman. This meant it was a civil matter and not a cause for Crown involvement under the peace was threatened. In canon law, consent given under duress was enough to invalidate a marriage, but this could not always be enforced in practice, given the prevalence of arranged marriages and the pressure on women to acquiesce once some time had passed. In Jane's case, the difficulty of the legal process was one of the reasons why a remedy was sought from Parliament, rather than the much slower course of seeking justice in the law courts. It is highly likely that Jane's case, and the plea in her petition for her abductors to be treated as felons, led to a change in the law in 1487. A new statute entitled 'An Acte agaynst taking awaye of Women agaynst theire Wills' (3 Hen 7 c.2) made abduction and forced marriage (or rape) of property-owning women or heiresses for the purposes of financial gain a felony. Those who aided and abetted the abduction or imprisonment were also guilty of a felony.

In 2003, after a battle in court over access to the name Survivor, this album would be re-released under his own name for Frontiers Records. Is a very solid, old-school AOR album, better than his previous, full of ballads and love anthems. The album highlight is the Baywatch hit theme song. Jamison carries the album with his warm and powerful voice. As bonus tracks, it appears three live versions from his touring (\\"Burning Heart\\", \\"Rebel Son\\" and \\"Too Hot to Sleep\\") plus the christmas song \\"Keep it Evergreen\\" and covers the number 2 hit song of the 1976 \\"Love is Alive\\" by Gary Wright.

Jamison is credited as the lyricist on this song along with Joe Henry, who co-wrote the Rascal Flatts hit \\"Skin\\" (this is not the Joe Henry who wrote Madonna's \\"Don't Tell Me\\").

Tom Brady won six Super Bowls as part of the Patriots dynasty. The Brady‚ÄìBelichick era, also known as the New England Patriots dynasty or the Patriots dynasty, was a sports dynasty in the National Football League (NFL) from the 2000 season to the 2019 season. Tom Brady and Bill Belichick are consistently credited with the Patriots' success, and are considered responsible for one of the sport's longest and most dominant dynasties. Whereas the Patriots had only appeared in (and lost) two Super Bowls prior to the Brady-Belichick era, the Patriots have appeared in nine Super Bowls since (more than any other franchise), of which they have won six (tied for all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers). The team also appeared in eight straight AFC Championship games between 2011 and 2018, and have recorded the only undefeated 16-game regular season. During the Brady-Belichick era, the Patriots have completed 19 consecutive winning seasons from 2001 to 2019 and boast a .784 win percentage against their division opponents. Of Brady's 18 seasons as a starter, the Patriots have played in 50% of all the Super Bowls, and have won 33% of them. In addition to their role in setting the Patriots' franchise records, Belichick holds the records for most Super Bowl appearances and victories as a head coach, and is tied with George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most NFL championships overall. Brady holds the records for most Super Bowl appearances, victories and MVP awards as a player in any position. Belichick and Brady have also been credited with helping to create and sustain the culture around the team, dubbed the \\"Patriot Way\\", where there is an emphasis on personal accountability, consistent improvement, and a focus on team success over personal gain. The era came to a definitive end on March 17, 2020, when Brady said he would be leaving the Patriots and later signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tom-brady-to-leave-new-england- patriots-play-elsewhere-next-season Bill Belichick Before coming to New England, Belichick had a 13-year stint with the New York Giants from 1979‚Äì1990. During this period, he was the defensive coordinator during the Giants' 20-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. Bill Belichick came to the New England Patriots in 1996 to serve as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach for Bill Parcells. The Patriots went 11-5 and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXI, but fell to Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers. Belichick subsequently served as assistant head coach and defensive coordinator for the New York Jets. When their head coach, Bill Parcells, retired in 1999, Belichick resigned as his successor and went to New England, this time as their head coach. In his 18-year tenure in New England, the Patriots have missed the playoffs only three times: 2000 (5-11), 2002 (9-7), and 2008 (11-5). In 2008, Belichick coached the Patriots to an 11-5 record despite losing franchise quarterback Tom Brady in Week 1 versus the Kansas City Chiefs. However, a series of division tiebreakers put the 11-5 Miami Dolphins as the AFC East champions, making the 2008 Patriots the second team in NFL history to go 11-5 and miss the playoffs. In 2010, he was selected as the first team head coach in the National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team. He has won the AP Coach of the Year award three times in his career, all during his time with the Patriots. As head coach, Belichick is 225-79 (.740 winning percentage) in regular season games and coached the Patriots to 40 postseason games, winning 30. From 2010-2017, Belichick coached the Patriots to 8 consecutive 12+ win seasons, an NFL record. The Patriots, since 2002, have lost more than 5 games just twice. As the Patriots head coach, Belichick has had just one losing season, in 2000. In 18 seasons from 2001 onwards, the Patriots have won 16 AFC East titles. Such dominance in the salary cap era, which limits teams in how much they can pay players and therefore forces parity, is credited to Belichick's football prowess. Belichick is known for taking players that otherwise had lackluster or declining careers and making them productive for one or more seasons. Belichick is credited for doing this with players such as RB Corey Dillon, who gained 1738 yards from scrimmage, including 1635 rushing yards. Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss was traded to New England in 2007 after lackluster play for the Oakland Raiders, but went on to catch 23 touchdowns in 2007, setting an NFL record. Belichick drafted wide receiver Julian Edelman in the 7th round. Edelman went on to set a franchise record for postseason receptions and caught one of the most memorable catches in Super Bowl LI. Most notably, Belichick is credited with drafting quarterback Tom Brady with the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft. Brady would go on to help the Patriots form a dynasty that has lasted from 2001 onwards, and currently holds every NFL postseason passing record except yards per attempt and completion percentage. Belichick is third all-time for wins as a coach. He is the longest tenured active coach in the NFL, and has won the most postseason games, at 31. He is the only coach to win three Super Bowls in four years and the only head coach in NFL history to have won 6 Super Bowls. Tom Brady Brady attended college at University of Michigan, where he battled for the starting role with Brian Griese and Drew Henson. He would lead the Wolverines to the 2000 Orange Bowl, with a record 10-2 as starter during their regular season. Despite trailing by two scores twice during the game, Brady led the Wolverines to an overtime win over the Alabama Crimson Tide, 35-34. His come-from-behind victory earned him the nickname \\"Comeback Kid\\". Due to questions about his starting ability in college and uninspiring physical statistics, Brady fell in the 2000 Draft until he was selected in the 6th round by the New England Patriots. He did not start until the next year, when franchise quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who had just signed a 10-year, $100 million contract that offseason, was injured by a sideline hit by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Brady went 11-3 as a starter in 2001, leading the Patriots to the Super Bowl against the St. Louis Rams. Despite trailing 17-3 in the second half, the Rams stormed back to tie the game 17-17 with 1:30 left in the game. With no time outs, the Patriots drove downfield to set up a 48-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri to win the game in the closing seconds. Brady currently holds the NFL postseason record for appearances, wins, pass attempts, completions, yards, and touchdowns. In the Super Bowl, Brady holds the record for most pass attempts, completions, touchdowns, and yards. In Super Bowl LI, he helped the Patriots, who were down 28-3 in the third quarter against the Atlanta Falcons, score 31 unanswered points and win the game in overtime, 34-28. He set a Super Bowl record 462 yards passing. The following year, he broke his own record by throwing a record 505 yards in a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Brady currently holds every Super Bowl record in passing except for completion percentage and interceptions. In his 9 appearances in 18 years, he has come away with 6 wins and 4 Super Bowl MVPs. Brady and Belichick era In the 2000 NFL Draft, first year head coach Bill Belichick was looking for ways to improve the New England team that had not been to a Super Bowl since 1996. Belichick had been hired after Pete Carroll was fired following the 1999 season. Prior to the draft the Patriots sent quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein to scout quarterbacks for the draft. When Rehbein returned, he stated that Brady was the best quarterback prospect for the Patriots' system. Despite the Patriots already having a franchise quarterback in Drew Bledsoe, the Patriots drafted Tom Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft. =2000‚Äì02: Beginnings and first Super Bowl= In 2000, Belichick had a tall order, having to help a Patriots team who still had Super Bowl aspirations after losing Super Bowl XXXI to the Green Bay Packers. Belichick, however, had one of the most damning quotes on the 2000 roster. Nearly 18 years later, Belichick reminisced, \\"Well, I mean, I‚Äôd say first of all, the biggest difference is in 2000, a quarter of the team couldn't pass the conditioning run, so that wasn‚Äôt a very good start. We don‚Äôt really deal with that now or haven't dealt with that in a while. Yeah, I don‚Äôt think there was a lot of commitment with that group. We obviously made a lot of changes from 2000 to 2001, and a lot of the guys that we stuck with from that team became pillars of the program, the organization in later years.\\" The Patriots went 5-11; the last losing season the Patriots have had as of 2019. Belichick, after a loss during the season, claimed that \\"I can't win games with 40 good players while the other team has 53\\" after lots of players showed up to camp out of condition. In 2001, Belichick made major reforms. The beginning of the culture he brought to New England, dubbed the \\"Patriot Way\\", was beginning to show with wide receiver Terry Glenn's contract holdout. The Patriots could not afford to raise Glenn's salary, and Belichick suspended Glenn indefinitely after repeated failed drug tests. Glenn did not receive a ring when the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI that year. The Patriots started 0-1, and faced a division rival in Week 2 against the New York Jets. Late in the game, down 10-3, quarterback Drew Bledsoe rolled out of the pocket and tried to scramble down the sideline, until he was nearly fatally hit by Jet's linebacker Mo Lewis. The internal bleeding almost killed Bledsoe later that day, and the concussion alone took him out of the game. The Patriots lost the game, moving to 0-2. Backup Tom Brady started for the next game against the Indianapolis Colts, the first of 17 games in the famous Tom Brady‚ÄìPeyton Manning rivalry, of which Brady has won 11, including two playoff games. The Patriots went 11-5, beat the Raiders in the Tuck Rule Game that closed Foxboro Stadium, then the Steelers on the road, ending the season with an upset of the heavily favored Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, 20-17. The Patriots started off 2002 hot, winning their first three games to open up the new Gillette Stadium, but losing the next four. They ended with a 9-7 record, but a series of division tiebreakers forced the Patriots out of the playoffs. It was one of only two times in the Brady/Belichick era that the Patriots missed the playoffs, and the only time with Brady as their starting quarterback. (They also missed the playoffs in 2008, when Matt Cassel replaced an injured Brady) =2003‚Äì04: Back-to-back Super Bowls= Ahead of the 2003 season, Bill Belichick shocked the NFL world in the offseason by releasing strong safety Lawyer Milloy due to contract issues. In his replacement, he signed hard-hitting enforcer Rodney Harrison, whose career appeared to be on the decline until that point. By the time Harrison retired in 2008, he held the NFL record for most sacks by a defensive back (30.5), the first defensive player to have 30 sacks and 30 interceptions, and holds the Patriot team record for postseason interceptions, with seven. However, many were shocked with Belichick's release of Milloy, whose job safety at the time seemed more secure than Brady's. The Patriots lost their season opener to the Buffalo Bills, who signed Milloy days earlier, 31-0. It would be the biggest loss of the Brady/Belichick era. What followed has been called one of the most successful two year stretches by a team in NFL history. The Patriots lost just three more games in 2003 and 2004 combined, culminating in back-to-back Super Bowl victories (Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX). In 2004, they set the then-NFL record for consecutive victories, from Week 5, 2003 through Week 7, 2004. =2005‚Äì06: Playoff disappointments= 2005 was somewhat of a down year for the Patriots as they finished with a 10-6 record. The 2005 season featured injuries to many key players including safety Rodney Harrison and forced for the Patriots to start 45 different players throughout the season, an NFL record. Linebacker Tedy Bruschi suffered a stroke and missed the beginning of the season before returning for the October 30th game against the Buffalo Bills. Despite the injuries, the Patriots won the AFC East for the third straight time. They defeated the Jaguars in the Wildcard, but fell to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Playoffs, committing five turnovers. In 2006, the Patriots came back strong, going 12-4 and winning the AFC East again. After beating the Jets and Chargers in the wildcard and divisional rounds, they squandered a 21-3 halftime lead against the Indianapolis Colts in the Conference Championship, and lost 38-34. =2007: 16‚Äì0 record = In 2007, the Patriots became the first team to win every regular season game since the NFL schedule was extended to 16 games. They outscored opposing teams by an average of 36-17. Brady won MVP for the first time in his career, throwing for 4800 yards and an NFL record 50 touchdowns. Wide receiver Randy Moss, traded to New England from the Oakland Raiders for a mere 5th round pick, caught an NFL record 23 touchdown passes, a record that still stands. After beating the Jacksonville Jaguars and San Diego Chargers in the playoffs, New England was handed their first defeat of the season by the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, 17-14. Super Bowl XLII would become renowned for the miraculous play made by Eli Manning and David Tyree which would go on to be known as The Helmet Catch. =2008‚Äì10: Brady's injury and more Playoff disappointments= The 2008 season started off with disaster for the Patriots, when Tom Brady suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 1 versus the Kansas City Chiefs. Despite the tough odds, Belichick coached the Patriots, with backup Matt Cassel under center, to a respectable 11-5 record. However, a series of division tiebreakers placed the 11-5 Miami Dolphins as the AFC East champion. The 2008 Patriots became the second 11-win team in NFL history to not make the playoffs (the other being the 1985 Broncos). The 2009 season was important for several reasons. They started the year with a comeback against the Bills to go 1-0. Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 6, the Patriots faced the first team with a loss in their record. The Patriots beat the Titans 59-0, tying the NFL record for the largest blowout since the merger. After a string of losses, including a heartbreaking road loss to the undefeated Colts, the Patriots went 10-6 and lost to the Baltimore Ravens 33-14 in the Wild Card Playoffs. However, Brady had a comeback year, throwing for 4,300 yards and 28 touchdowns. In 2010, the Patriots went 14-2 and won the AFC East outright. Brady became the first unanimous NFL MVP, as well as the Offensive Player of the year. With all the regular season hype, the Patriots failed to live up to it in the playoffs, losing in the Divisional Round to the Jets 28-21. It would be the last time the Patriots did not reach the AFC Championship Game until 2019 when they lost in the Wild Card game to the Tennessee Titans. =2011‚Äì13: Super Bowl loss and consecutive losses in the AFC Championship Game= Brady attempts a pass against the Carolina Panthers in 2013 In 2011, the Patriots had another strong year, finishing with a 13-3 record, winning the AFC East, and making it to the Super Bowl. Tom Brady threw for 5,235 yards, still short of the NFL single-season record which was set by Drew Brees in the same year. Against the New York Giants, Brady was pressured again and had difficulty scoring points. Another miracle play for the Giants offense made by Eli Manning on a pass to Mario Manningham led the Giants offense to take a late lead over the Patriots in the fourth quarter. The Patriots would again fall to Manning and the Giants in Super Bowl XLVI 21-17. For the 2012 season, Brady threw for 4,827 yards and rushing for a career-high 4 touchdowns. But after beating the Texans in the Divisional round, they fell to the Baltimore Ravens in the Conference Championship 28-13. Brady and Belichick led the 2013 Patriots team to a 12-4 record, earning the team a first round playoff bye week for the fourth year in a row even though Brady threw for only 25 touchdowns and double digit interceptions. The premier victory of the Patriots regular season came in Week 6 against the New Orleans Saints. Despite consecutive drives ending in a 3-and-out and a seemingly game- deciding interception with 2:16 left in the fourth quarter, the Patriots defense forced the Saints to punt with 1:13 left in the game. Brady then led the Patriots to score with only 5 seconds left, throwing to Kenbrell Thompkins in the corner of the end zone. In the playoffs, the Patriots easily made it to the AFC Championship where they would face the record-breaking offense of the Denver Broncos. In another Tom Brady‚ÄìPeyton Manning rivalry game, the Broncos kept their foot on the gas, winning 26-16. =2014: Fourth Super Bowl= The Patriots began the 2014 season with a rough 2-2 record, including an embarrassing loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4. Many sports writers were beginning to call for the end of the Patriots dynasty, which had not won a Super Bowl in a decade. Still, the Patriots bounced back and went 10-2 down the stretch to finish the season 12-4. After coming back from two 14 point deficits to beat the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round, the Patriots routed the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 in the AFC Championship game, giving them their 6th Super Bowl appearance since 2001. After throwing two interceptions and leaving his team down by 10 points in the 4th quarter, Brady led the Patriots on two touchdown drives against the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots capped off the comeback with a touchdown pass to Julian Edelman with just over two minutes remaining in regulation. On the ensuing Seahawks drive, quarterback Russell Wilson threw a deep pass to wide receiver Jermaine Kearse that was initially deflected by cornerback Malcolm Butler. However, Kearse juggled the ball on his chest and caught it, giving Seattle a first down on the 5 yard line. Color commentator Cris Collinsworth compared the acrobatic catch to David Tyree's iconic \\"Helmet Catch\\" against the Patriots in XLII. On the next play, running back Marshawn Lynch rumbled to the 1 yard line until he was tackled by Dont'a Hightower. Later on, Hightower was credited with one of the most amazing tackles of the game, as he had to bench press a lineman off of him and dive tackle Lynch with his shoulder. On the next play, with 26 seconds left in the game, Wilson threw the ball to the right, intended for Ricardo Lockette. Instead, undrafted rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler read the route and intercepted the ball on the goal line in one of the most iconic plays in football lore. The Patriots prevailed, 28-24. =2015: AFC Championship loss= The Patriots had a hot start to the 2015 season, winning their first 10 games. However, a series of injuries, including Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Brandon LaFell, Dion Lewis, and at one point, the entire offensive line, led to the Patriots losing 4 of their next 6 games. After beating the Chiefs in the Divisional round, Brady faced the vaunted Broncos defense in the AFC Championship game. The Patriots lost, 20-18. =2016: Fifth Super Bowl Victory = As a result from his involvement in the Deflategate scandal, Brady was suspended for the first 4 games of the 2016 season. With backups Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, the Patriots started the year 3-1. With Brady back in Week 5, the Patriots lost just one game the rest of the season and dominated to a 14-2 finish. After beating the Houston Texans and the Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs, the Patriots' 3rd highest scoring offense and 1st scoring defense faced the Atlanta Falcons's 1st scoring offense and 27th scoring defense in Super Bowl LI. Against the Falcons, the Patriots defense couldn't stop the high-powered Falcons offense. Brady was inconsistent, off on his throws and threw an interception to Robert Alford that was returned for a touchdown, the first in Brady's postseason career. By halftime, the score was 21-3. The Falcons scored again in the third quarter to make the score 28-3, a 25-point deficit. In Super Bowls, the largest deficit ever overcome was 10 points. The Patriots scored 31 unanswered points to win the Super Bowl 34-28 in overtime. It was the first Super Bowl to go to overtime, as well as the largest deficit overcome. Brady won his 4th Super Bowl MVP for setting a Super Bowl record 466 passing yards. 30 Super Bowl records were broken or tied in Super Bowl LI. =2017: Super Bowl loss= The Patriots started off the 2017 season slow yet again, going 2-2 until going 11-1 down the stretch to win another AFC East title and first seed in the AFC. Brady became the oldest MVP in the NFL, at 40. He also became the oldest quarterback to lead the NFL in passing with 4,577 yards. After defeating the Tennessee Titans and Jacksonville Jaguars in the playoffs, they faced backup quarterback Nick Foles and the high-powered Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. The Patriots were aiming to be the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since they themselves won back-to-back from 2003-2004. In a high-scoring shootout, Brady was slated to lead the Patriots to another comeback victory late in the fourth quarter when Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip sacked Brady and the ball was recovered by the Eagles, securing a Patriots defeat, 41-33. Brady set another Super Bowl record with 505 yards passing, breaking the previous record he had set the year before. =2018: Sixth Super Bowl victory= The Patriots drew much criticism in the early weeks of 2018, after losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars and the winless Detroit Lions in the first three weeks, teams who ended below .500 on the season. However, the Patriots bounced back with a string of wins, including a Sunday Night thriller at home against the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs led by young phenom Patrick Mahomes, who would go on to throw over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns that season and win the NFL MVP award. In Week 14 at Miami, the Patriots led with 7 seconds left in the game. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill passed the ball to Kenny Stills, who then lateraled the ball to DeVante Parker, who in turn tossed the ball to Kenyan Drake. Drake then ran the remaining 53 yards for the touchdown with no time on the clock, immortalizing the play in NFL lore as the Miracle in Miami. For the first time in almost a decade, the Patriots finished the season with more than four losses at 11‚Äì5, securing the AFC East for a record 10th consecutive time (an NFL record and tying the Atlanta Braves for most consecutive playoff berths) and the AFC's 2nd seed behind the 12‚Äì4 Chiefs. After defeating the Los Angeles Chargers handily 41‚Äì28 in the Divisional Round, the Patriots faced Mahomes and the vaunted Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game. After leading 14‚Äì0 at halftime, the Patriots fought a comeback by the Chiefs, forcing the game to overtime tied 31-31. On the next drive, the Patriots quickly moved downfield through critical third down completions to Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski, setting up a touchdown run by Rex Burkhead. Belichick and Brady earned their 3rd straight Super Bowl trip and their ninth overall, more than any other coach/quarterback duo. In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots' stiff defense held the high-scoring Los Angeles Rams offense to three points all game, sacking quarterback Jared Goff four times and intercepting him once, allowing a 57.6 passer rating. The Patriot offense started slow, with Brady throwing an early interception. However, they came back late in the fourth quarter with a 29 yard pass from Brady to Gronkowski, capped by a two yard run by rookie Sony Michel. One Stephen Gostkowski field goal later cemented the win, 13‚Äì3. It is the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, and Brady and Belichick's sixth and final Super Bowl win together. =2019: Swan Song= The Patriots started 8-0, but finished 4-4, including a stunning Week 17 loss to the Dolphins at home that forced New England to play a wild card game for the first time since 2009 against the Tennessee Titans, coached by ex-Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel who won three Super Bowls (XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX) in Foxborough. Tennessee shocked the Patriots 20-13 at Gillette Stadium, avenging the 2003 and 2017 divisional round defeats at the same venue. The last pass of Tom Brady as a Patriot was a pick-six to his former teammate Logan Ryan who joined the Titans in 2017 after spending his first four years and winning two Super Bowls (XLIX, LI) in Foxborough. Tom Brady would go on to join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 17, 2020, separating the Belichick and Brady duo, while his former team signs ex- Carolina Panthers quarterback and 2015 MVP Cam Newton. The \\"Patriot Way\\" According to many writers and analysts, the culture that Bill Belichick upheld in New England, dubbed the \\"Patriot Way\\", helped to sustain the success the Patriots have enjoyed. Belichick has been known to be very punctual and attentive to detail in order to win. Players such as Brady, All-Pro Safety Devin McCourty, and longtime Patriot Julian Edelman are players who are known to keep the culture around New England alive. For example, Brady has consistently taken pay cuts, despite his elite performance. In 2017, Brady's cap value was only $14 million. Moreover, the total cash spent on Brady in 2017 was a mere $1 million. Despite such low pay, Brady played at an elite level and set several NFL records for a 40-year-old quarterback, culminating in an MVP award and a record-breaking 505 passing yards in Super Bowl LII. When asked why he accepts pay cuts and a salary below market value, Brady replied \\"I think the thing I've always felt for me in my life, winning has been a priority. And my wife (model Gisele B√ºndchen) makes a lot of money. I'm a little smarter than you think... Actually, it's a salary cap. You can only spend so much and the more that one guy gets is less for others. And for a competitive advantage standpoint, I like to get a lot of good players around me.\\" Brady's willingness to take pay cuts allows the Patriots to spend that money elsewhere on more skilled players. A famous example of this was in the signing of Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss in 2007. According to Patriots executives, Brady restructured his contract to allow the Patriots to acquire the cap space needed to sign Moss. Moss would then go on to set the NFL single season receiving touchdown record, one that still stands today. Another example of Belichick's disciplinarian demeanor is how he handled running back Jonas Gray. In Week 11, Gray rushed for 201 yards and set a franchise record for touchdowns in a game, with four. However, he was active in only five more games for the Patriots, and was released less than a year later. Although he had a stellar debut, he was often late to meetings and practice, something Belichick does not tolerate. Instead, Belichick kept with his pounding, one-dimensional running back LeGarrette Blount for the rest of the year. Controversies Spygate was an incident during the 2007 NFL season, when the Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location. Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL de jure, but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. Because the Patriots were instead videotaping the Jets' coaches from their own sideline, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell deemed it to be in violation of league rules, stating that the act represented a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long-standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition. After an investigation, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000 (the maximum allowed by the league and the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in league history) for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their first-round selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. After the original incident, several other allegations were made against the Patriots filming opposing teams. Deflategate was a controversy involving the allegation that Brady ordered the deliberate deflating of footballs used in the Patriots' victory against the Indianapolis Colts in the American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game of the 2014‚Äì15 NFL playoffs. The controversy resulted in Brady being suspended for four games, the Patriots being fined $1 million and losing two draft picks, and saw the NFL later change the procedure for monitoring football pressure. For his alleged part in the scandal, Brady was originally suspended by the league for four games of the 2015 regular season, but a federal judge later vacated his suspension, and allowed Brady to resume his playing duties for the entirety of the 2015 season. However, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Brady's four-game suspension, which became effective for the 2016 regular season. After losing a request for a rehearing, Brady chose to accept the suspension. The controversy remained a topic of discussion during the 2016 season, which concluded with the Patriots winning Super Bowl LI and Brady being named the MVP of the game.

Old St Patrick's In 1858, seven years after the arrival of convicts in York, many of whom were Catholic, the numbers of Catholics in the community had increased and a Spanish monk, Fr Francisco Salvado (with a stress on the \\"O\\" and no relation to Bishop Rosendo Salvado) was stationed in York. Immediately, he started raising funds to build a small mission like church. By the end of the year he had raised ¬£25. A foundation stone was laid on St Patrick‚Äôs Day, 17 March 1859 by Bishop Serra. About 100 people came for the ceremony. In October 1859, the government gave ¬£25 towards the construction cost of the church, being the same amount that was given for Holy Trinity Church. The building was originally made of fired brick, rendered with a lime and sand mortar and painted a light brown colour. And the cost was ¬£180. The builder of the church is not known. The church was opened on 17 March 1860 and dedicated by Father Martin Griver. The organist from New Norcia made the journey for the opening with a small harmonium to accompany the singing. The church is a simple Gothic design and could hold 80 people reasonably comfortably. A narrow room at the rear of the building was designed to be used as a sacristy, but also became Fr Salvado‚Äôs living quarters. At the time, there were about 200 Catholics in York, mostly convicts. In September 1863, Resident Magistrate Walkinshaw Cowan accused Fr Salvado of having an involvement with a young woman who was his housekeeper. Salvado defended himself but was stood down and forced to return to Spain. For a short period, the parish was served by Father Anselm Bourke but in 1868, he was replaced by Fr Patrick Joseph Gibney.Everything in this sections is sourced from AM (Tony) Clack, Glorious Apostle, A History of the Catholic Church in York, St Patrick‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church, 2009, p.28-41. St Patrick's Father Gibney served as the Catholic priest from 1868 to the early 1900s. His main achievement was construction of the new church we now know as St Patrick's, which is the larger church to the right of the old St Patrick's. At the time of its construction, York was the fourth largest town in Western Australia (after Perth, Fremantle and Albany) and so a \\"substantial and commodious\\" building was planned. Prior to construction, a large quantity of building material was being collected on the site.WA Catholic Record, 6 July 1874, p.3c. The architect of St Patrick's was Joseph Nunan, who was one of the 61 Fenians to arrive on the last convict ship to Australia on 10 January 1868, the Hougoumont. 28 October 1874 was planned for the laying of the foundation stone, but this was delayed until Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March 1875, so that Bishop Matthew Griver could perform the task.Lane, L and Wilkes F, The New Church of St Patrick and Father Patrick Joseph Gibney (including) The Sisters of Mercy in York 1831-1915, unpublished historical research, May 1999. Henry Davies was contracted as stonemason, with other work undertaken by sub- contractors.WA Catholic Record, 25 January 1883, p.5. Ticket-of-leave men were employed from 1868 to 1875.R Erikson: Dictionary of Western Australians, re Patrick Gibney. The carting of timber, lime, stone and bricks was contributed by parishioners and Gibney himself is recorded as carting 39 loads of timber and contributing 322 days of labour on the carting of stone and bricks, as well as undertaking his regular duties. The next highest contributor was E Cahill who carted 9 loads and provided 41 days of labour. Fundraising was by many fairs run by the Sisters of Mercy.WA Catholic Record, 6 May 1875, p.3. By May 1877, the work of the stonemasons was sufficiently advanced that tenders were called for the roof.WA Catholic Record, 6 September 1877, p.4b. A German immigrant, Thomas Prunster was responsible for many of the timber fittings inside the church: the hammer beams supporting the roof, the high choir and organ gallery above the entrance and the stairway in the tower. The roof was constructed in timber shingles by Thomas Tompkinson with thousands of sheoak shingles.AM (Tony) Clack, Glorious Apostle, A History of the Catholic Church in York, St Patrick‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church, 2009, p.66-75. Opening and dedication There was an inaugural blessing and opening of the unfinished church on 14 January 1883, by the brother of Father Gibney, Bishop Matthew Gibney.WA Catholic Record, 25 January 1883, p.5. Three years later, on 21 February 1886, the church was dedicated to Saint Patrick, with the ceremony of dedication being performed by Rosendo Salvado. The cost of the church to that time was ¬£7,000 raised from 800 parishioners, with the stained glass from Franz Mayer and Co of Munich and London costing ¬£330.Western Mail, 27 February 1886, p.8. Further work During the following decade, work continued on the tower, which was eventually completed in 1909, and at the same time, the roof shingles were replaced with slate.AM (Tony) Clack, Glorious Apostle, A History of the Catholic Church in York, St Patrick‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church, 2009, p.100.

The center was established in 1966 and is housed in a former synagogue built in the Moorish Revival architectural style. The center is run as a public institution by the Sarajevo Canton.  History  In 1923 the Jewish Municipality of Sarajevo drew out plans to build a monumental synagogue in the city, at that time the capital of the Drinska banovina, which was home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The preliminary plans outlined the municipality's desire for the synagogue to be the largest in Southeastern Europe. The motive behind the project was the fact that none of the city's existing synagogues could hold more than a fifth of the total Jewish congregation. A project board formed by the municipality and headed by notable Jewish industrialist, Avram Majer Altarac, purchased the land for 100,000 CHF, with construction beginning in 1926. The famous Croatian Art Nouveau architect Rudolf Lubinski was hired to design the building. His concept of a lavish Moorish Revivalist design, which was prevalent in the architecture of Sarajevo since Austro- Hungarian times was green lighted, with construction being completed in 1930. The synagogue, known as the Il Kal Grande, was officially opened on 14 May 1931. After the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the establishment of the puppet Independent State of Croatia, severe racial laws were implemented by the occupying forced which lead to the desecration and looting of the synagogue in the first months of the occupation. \\"Jasenovac-Donja Gradina 1941‚Äì1945\\" After the end of the war the Jewish Municipality, whose community was desecrated during the holocaust with over 90 percent being murdered in concentration camps, donated the building to the city of Sarajevo. In 1965 architect Ivan ≈†traus was chosen to head renovation work on the building, which was reestablished as the ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá Center, named after Yugoslav communist and revolutionary ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá. The center contained a state of the art movie theatre, numerous workshops, classrooms and an art gallery. In 1993, during the Siege of Sarajevo, the center was symbolically renamed the Bosnian Cultural Center. During subsequent years it has become the premier cultural center in Bosnia and Herzegovina, hosting weekly concerts, theatre productions and film screenings. It is one of the venues of the Sarajevo Film Festival, Sarajevo Jazz Festival and the main venue for Juventafest. It was expanded and renovated in 2015. Further renovations are planned for 2019.

Its founder and director is Orley R. \\"Chip\\" Taylor, a \\"world-renowned expert on butterflies and their migration patterns.\\" The organization creates and distributes tags to place on monarch butterflies in order to track their migration path from Canada and the United States to south-central Mexico. The tagging method used is derived from the one that was developed by Canadian scientist, Fred Urquhart. The tagging process was adapted by Orley Taylor to minimize the damage to the butterflies. Color-coded tags are glued to a monarch butterfly's wing. Volunteers have tagged over 1.5 million monarchs in the last 26 years from Colorado to Canada.  Monarch Waystation Program  Monarch Waystation Sign The monarch butterfly is also known as the milkweed butterfly due to its subsistence on the milkweed plant for its habitat. Largely due to commercial farming practices, the habitats of monarch butterflies have declined. In an effort to mitigate the destruction of the monarch butterflies natural habitat, Monarch Watch has called for volunteers to plant milkweed wherever possible. Milkweed is essential to the life-cycle of the monarch butterfly as they lay their eggs on the underside of the plant's leaves. It is possible to register and certify a site that is designated as a \\"Monarch Waystation.\\" These sites can also be added to an interactive map that is monitored by Monarch Watch. The program also offers free milkweed plugs to people that engage in the creation of habitats for monarchs and pollinators. Primary consideration is given to non-profits and schools. There is an application process to receive the milkweed from Monarch Watch.  Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign  Monarch Watch is not only focused on tracking the fall migration of monarchs, but also on the conservation of the monarch butterfly through the preservation and restoration of monarch habitats. The destruction of habitats has negatively affected the monarch butterfly population as well as that of other pollinators. Habitat shrinkage has resulted in the extinction of several species of pollinators over the last 50 years. The monarch butterfly is also affected by parasites and the \\"declining winter habitat in Mexico.\\" Monarch Watch's efforts in this arena are specifically referred to at the \\"Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign.\\" The Bring Back the Monarchs Campaign is an offshoot of the Monarch Waystation Program. = Milkweed Market = Beyond offering free milkweed plugs, Monarch Watch also offers a shop by which an individual can purchase milkweed for the purpose of creating monarch habitats. The milkweed species offered to the buyer is contingent on the buyer's zip code, in an effort to ensure that only native milkweed is planted in the appropriate regional areas.

Role in diplomacy Hunter's residence in Bangkok, the \\"British factory\\" Hunter also secured permission from the king for other Europeans to build on the river bank, and many moved from floating houses into new structures.Neale, Narrative of a Residence, pp. 30‚Äì32 He lived in the Kudi Chin community, initially owning a large floating house before moving into a Western-style building upon its completion in 1840.Bristowe, \\"Robert Hunter in Siam\\" His emporium was well known among the populace. Westerners came to refer to Hunter's prominent building as the British factory;Moore, \\"Early British Merchant\\", pp. 21‚Äì23 in absence of a British embassy or formal Anglo-Siamese diplomatic relations, Hunter personally managed the exchange of goods and visitors between Singapore ‚Äì the nearest British entrep√¥t ‚Äì and Bangkok. He was known for his hospitality to Western visitors and would entertain them: often taking them sailing on his 30-ton cutter, Friends, going on shooting expeditions, playing cards, dining and drinking.Bristowe, \\"Robert Hunter in Siam\\" Hunter's wife, Lady Sap (‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏±‡∏û‡∏¢‡πå, Christian name Angelina, 1805 ‚Äì 1884) In 1825, Hunter married a half-Portuguese, half-Siamese woman named Angelina Sap who was from a respected Portuguese familyVan Roy, Siamese Melting Pot, p. 63 and a descendant of Constantine Phaulkon, the 17th-century adventurer in Siam.Moore, \\"Early British Merchant\\", p. 35 Through his wife, Hunter learned Portuguese and Thai. There were no other English-speakers present at court, so his fluency in Thai made him crucial in trade and diplomacy between Siamese nobles and visiting merchants.Bristowe, \\"Robert Hunter in Siam\\" His privileged position enabled him to guide diplomatic and Christian missions entering the country. He aided Henry Burney's successful treaty mission in 1826, and the governor of Singapore later praised Hunter for a history of \\"infinite service in our negotiation with [Rama III]\\".W.J. Butterworth to W. Edwards, 13 February 1845, in Burney Papers, Vol. 4, Pt. 2, p. 161 Hunter was also lauded in Siam, receiving the noble title Luang Awutwiset in 1831,Farrington, Early Missionaries, p. 159 n. 6 which signified his service to the kingdom in supplying weapons.Van Roy, Siamese Melting Pot, p. 63Moore, \\"Early British Merchant\\", p. 34 In 1842, he helped negotiate for the restoration of the Sultan of Kedah after 20 years of Siamese occupation.Singhs, \\"Opening of Siam\\", p. 782 \\"Discovery\\" of Siamese twins Colored engraving of the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng (1829) Hunter is credited with bringing the original Siamese twins to global attention. In 1824, he was sailing up the Chao Phraya River at dusk when he saw a \\"strange animal\\" ‚Äì in actuality the shirtless twins bathing.In his November 1829 account of the discovery, John Collins Warren wrote: \\"They were naked from the hips upwards, were very thin in their persons, and it being dusk, he mistook them for some strange animal\\". Orser 2014, p. 13. He befriended Chang and Eng, their mother and family, and he told them many stories of the wonders of the western world.Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, 27‚Äì28 He recognized the potential profit in exhibiting them publicly and sought permission from them, their family and the king to bring them to England.Orser, Lives of Chang & Eng, pp. 13‚Äì14 While the twins and their family were willing, it took five years to secure permission from the king.Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, 27‚Äì28 Hunter's partner in this business venture was American sea captain Abel Coffin. Coffin and Hunter sailed to Boston with the twins in the summer of 1829.Orser, Lives of Chang & Eng, p. 9 They signed a contract with the brothers for a five-year tour, and the value of the contract is disputed. Hunter and Coffin said it was for $3,000, but Chang and Eng said it was for $500.Orser, Lives of Chang & Eng, p. 48 Hunter and Coffin traveled with Chang and Eng, exhibiting them in Boston, New York and London. After success in London, Coffin went with Chang and Eng on a tour of the British Isles. While in Scotland, the twins stayed as guests at the Hunter family home in Neilston, but Hunter had stayed behind in London.Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, 57 His business in Siam took priority, and he departed on 28 September 1830, bound for Bangkok via Singapore. In 1831, Coffin bought out Hunter's share in the venture. Nevertheless, Hunter remained in contact with the twins and their family in Siam, regularly corresponding with all parties well into the 1840s.Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, pp. 59‚Äì61 Origins of conflict with Rama III Hunter partnered in trade with another British merchant, James Hayes. The Burney Treaty granted more trading privileges for all British merchants in Singapore, but Hunter & Hayes dominated the market in Bangkok.SarDesai, British Trade, p. 80 They had a monopoly on imports from Britain, which were limited to shipments of textiles from Liverpool, but their business was overwhelmingly in exports,Neale, Narrative of a Residence, p. 176 in part because they had a monopoly on the European-type square-rigged vessels which the king's court could use for trade.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 139 In September 1835, an American captain was severely wounded after shooting two pigeons on the grounds of a Buddhist monastery. Two monks fought against him as he tried to retrieve the pigeons, ignorant of his trespass. He was struck hard on the head, and Hunter hurried him into the care of Dan Beach Bradley. He demanded the death penalty for the monks and threatened British military action if his demands were not met, causing a public stir and distressing the royal court.Cort, Siam, p. 284‚Äì285 Rama III explained to Hunter that the monks had their own independent judicial system, and he referred the case to his half-brother in the priesthood ‚Äì Mongkut, the future king ‚Äì who punished the monks lightly.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, pp. 138‚Äì39 As trade increased through the 1830s, the king and nobles acquired their own vessels and began to deal with foreign merchants independently of Hunter.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 139 He decided to compensate for his falling profits by trading in opium ‚Äì which was strictly forbidden in the kingdom at the time.Vella, Siam Under Rama III, pp. 128‚Äì129 But the king acted cautiously because Siam did not have the naval means to combat the Royal Navy (if Hunter's threatened warships actually appeared) or to disrupt opium shipments at sea.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 149 Goods laid in port, however, could be easily seized.SarDesai, British Trade, p. 81 In 1839, Hunter & Hayes complained of suffering great losses over the unexpected monopolization of teakChristopher Harvey to Lord Ellenborough, 28 May 1843, in Burney Papers, Vol. 4, Pt. 2, pp. 81‚Äì83 and then even greater loss in 1842 when the king introduced a heavy levy on sugar and seized Hunter's stock to collect.Robert Hunter to Lord Ellenborough, 24 April 1844, in Burney Papers, Vol. 4, Pt. 2, p. 130‚Äì131Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 147‚Äì49 Whereas he had once been partners with the king's court in trade, he had grown to be a rival.G. Broadfoot to F. Currie Esq., 2 July 1844, in Burney Papers, Vol. 4, Pt. 2, p. 141 Express incident The climax of the conflict between Hunter and Rama III was over the sale of a steamship. Example of a steamship from the era, SS Great Britain (1844) Apprehensive of British intentions in the region after the First Opium War, the king had ordered from Hunter & Hayes a large supply of guns and a steamship to use in case British gunships attacked Siam. The hostilities in China ended with the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, and the British did not proceed to attack Siam. Therefore, the king no longer wanted a steamship by the time Express arrived in Bangkok on 11 January 1844. The sale of the ship was fraught with disagreement. It is unclear whether the king refused to pay the previously agreed price or if Hunter attempted to extort from him quadruple the value of the vessel,SarDesai, British Trade, p. 85 n. 59 but tensions in the negotiations reached a boiling point when Hunter threatened to sell Express to Siam‚Äôs enemy, the Vietnamese in nearby Cochinchina.W.J. Butterworth to W. Edwards Esq., 13 February 1845, in Burney Papers, Vol. 4, Pt. 2, p. 165 The king was outraged by the threat and ordered Hunter to leave Siam immediately. On 24 February, Hunter departed Bangkok on Express, bound for Singapore.Bradley, Journal of Bradley, p. 92 Upon landing in Singapore, Hunter lodged a complaint with the colonial governor. Unsatisfied with his response, Hunter steamed Express to Calcutta, the headquarters of the East India Company, to petition for redress of his grievances with the king. He claimed that Rama III had violated articles of the Burney Treaty of 1826, and he recommended the establishment of a British consul in Bangkok, appearance of gunships in the area and a renegotiation of the import duty. The Governor-General of India took no action, however, agreeing with the judgments of his subordinates that any violations on the king's part owed to personal dispute with Hunter and were not instances of systematic breach.Singhs, \\"Opening of Siam\\", pp. 783‚Äì784 Hunter eventually made good on his threat and sold Express at a loss to the Vietnamese for a price of 53,000 Spanish dollars. Christopher Harvey, an assistant of Hunter & Hayes, continued the business in Bangkok after Hunter‚Äôs departure in February.Wilson, \\"State and Society, Part 1\\", p. 188 Hunter returned to Bangkok in July to collect his outstanding debts. The king permitted him to enter the country and remove his personal possessions, but he withheld logistical assistance.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 148 Hunter then dissolved his enterprise and departed Siam on 29 December 1844.Singhs, \\"Opening of Siam\\", p. 784 Death and legacy Hunter returned to his native Scotland and died at his residence in Lilybank, Glasgow on 7 September 1848.Singapore Free Press, 16 November 1848 His son, Robert Hunter, Jr., stayed in Siam after his father's departure and enjoyed more favor with the court.Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, p. 88 He died on 19 April 1865 and was buried in Bangkok Protestant Cemetery. Hunter was socially adaptable and persuasive,Hunter, Duet for a Lifetime p. 26 but his \\"shrewdness, arrogance and fire were more memorable than the streaks of kindness which undoubtedly existed.\\"Bristowe, \\"Robert Hunter in Siam\\" During the unsuccessful treaty mission of James Brooke in 1850, Rama III cited Hunter's fractious behavior as a reason for rejecting the terms for freer residence of Europeans.Frankfurter, \\"Mission of Sir James Brooke\\", p. 29 The king did not want more troublesome merchants like Hunter,Hunter, Duet For a Lifetime, p. 88Bristowe, Louis and the King of Siam, p. 133 n. 2 and he distrusted Westerners for the rest of his reign.Terwiel, History of Modern Thailand, p. 149 Siam's foreign relations did not change until the ascension of Mongkut, Rama IV, who signed the Bowring Treaty in 1855. This significantly liberalized trade between the British and Siam, notably allowing for the duty-free importation of opium.

The British captured her c. 1800 and she made some voyages as a West Indiaman. She also made a cruise as a privateer. Between 1803 and 1808 she served the Royal Navy as an armed defense and hired armed ship on the Leith Station. She spent her time escorting convoys in the North Sea and captured one French privateer. After her naval service, between 1808 and 1814 Norfolk was a London-based transport. From 1814 to 1820 she made four voyages as a whaler in the Southern Whale Fishery. She was last listed in 1823. Career Norfolk entered Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping in 1800. They described her as a French prize. Lloyd's Register gave her master's name as Goodall, and her owner as Thompson; the Register of Shipping did not have a name for her master, but also gave the name of her owner as Thompson. Lloyd's Register gave her trade as London‚ÄìSuriname, and the Register of Shipping gave it as London‚ÄìWest Indies. She had had a thorough repair in 1799, or had been almost rebuilt in 1800. On 20 May 1800 Captain Thomas Goodall acquired a letter of marque. He sailed Norfolk to Suriname and returned in November.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4106. Goodall acquired a second letter of marque on 29 January 1801. This one showed Norfolk with a large complement, one more consistent with a privateer than a merchantman. On 11 February Norfolk, Goddall, master, sailed from Falmouth on a cruise.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4126. On 21 February she sent into Falmouth Mercury, Pont_l__, master, which had been sailing from Teneriffe to Hamburg.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4128. Lloyd's List reported on 3 July 1801 that Norfolk, Goodall, master, had arrived in Suriname from London, having engaged a Spanish frigate on the way.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4165. Norfolk arrived off Portsmouth in early September, having left Suriname on 11 July, Martinique on 23 July, and Montserrat on 28 July.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4183. She arrived at Gravesend on 5 September. Norfolk had damages repaired in 1801.Register of Shipping (1802), Seq.‚ÑñN320. =Armed defense and hired armed ship= Following the resumption of war with France in early 1803, concern developed in Britain about Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. The British government's response took many forms including the reactivation of Fencible regiments and the Sea Fencibles, a program of the construction of Martello Towers along the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and the commissioning of a number of armed defense ships. The British East India Company in November voted to underwrite 10,000 tons (bm) of armed transports to protect Great Britain's coasts. The vessels were existing, but not EIC, merchantmen that would receive an upgrade in armament and that would receive a naval officer as captain. One of the vessels was Norfolk; the others were Albion, , , Aurora, , , , Helder, , , Lord Nelson, , , , Sir Alexander Mitchell, , and Triton. On 21 November 1803 Norfolk, of 600 tons (bm) and 18 guns (32 & 24-pounders), was listed as having been appointed to the Leith Station.http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/N/03273a.html Naval Database.] On 4 July 1804 Lieutenant Sinclair sailed her to the Leith station.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.248. In 1805 Norfolk had damages repaired. At 8am on 26 January 1807, six or seven miles off Flambro Head Norfolk, under Commander William Richan,Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, part 2, p.294. sighted a lugger pursuing some merchant vessels. Norfolk gave chase and after almost four and a half hours succeeded in catching up with and capturing the French privateer . Adolphe, under the command of Jacques Francis Leclerc, was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 39 men. She had thrown two guns, 14 carriages, her boat and her ports overboard during the chase. She had sailed from the Dunkirk Roads on 21 January and two days later near Dogger Bank had captured Leith Packet, which was carrying a cargo of hemp from Tonningen to London. The packet's master, five crew members, and three passengers were aboard Adolphe. Norfolk took \\"Delpha\\" into Leith.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4124. There is a story that Richan was also a smuggler and used Norfolk for smuggling forays. Mr. Robert Pringle, Collector of Excise, found a pretext on which to board and search Norfolk. When he did so he found that even her guns were loaded with tea and tobacco. The Excise then seized the ship. Richan was permitted to retire from the Navy. On 23 May Norfolk and several other armed ships and naval vessels, and their convoys, arrived at Elsinore from Orkney.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4158. Then on 27 May she sailed from Elsinore for Orkney with a fleet.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4159. On 14 July Norfolk and a fleet arrived at Elsinore from Orkney.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4173. On 21 July Norfolk sailed for Orkney.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4175. Although the to-and- fro between Elsinore and Orkney probably represented convoy escort, the Royal Navy went on to participate in the Battle of Copenhagen (1807). However, Norfolk was not among the vessels listed as qualifying for prize money for the battle. By 22 January 1808 Norfolk was back at Gravesend, having arrived from the North Sea.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4223. =Transport= After her service with the Royal Navy, Norfolk became a London-based transport. In 1810 her master was A. Walton and her owner Thompson.Register of Shipping (1810), Seq.‚ÑñN327. On 6 August 1811 she arrived at Portsmouth, having left St Thomas on 2 July in a convoy of some 80 vessels under convoy by the frigate .Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4587. Norfolk underwent a good repair in 1812. =Whaler= 1st whaling voyage (1814): Captain Holden Barton sailed from London in October 1814, bound for South Georgia. He returned with 500 casks (3500 barrels of elephant oil) and 5000 seal skins. The oil sold for ¬£50 per tun and the skins for ¬£2 per skin. 2nd whaling voyage (1816): Captain Holden Barton sailed from London in May 1816, bound for South Georgia. The schooner Ann, of 150 tons (bm), accompanied Norfolk to act as a ship's tender. On the outward-bound leg, Norfolk was nearly lost off Brazil. At South Georgia a shallop was lost with at least three crewmen. Norfolk returned with 400 tuns of oil and 10,000 seal skins. (Sixty tuns of blubber were lost when a sloop foundered.) At the time of Norfolks return her owner may have been bankrupt. 3rd whaling voyage (1817-1818): Captain Barton sailed on 23 June 1817. Norfolk returned on 22 May 1818. Norfolk underwent a good repair in 1818. 4th whaling voyage (1818-1820): Captain W. Smith sailed on 23 July 1818. Norfolk returned on 3 March 1820. Fate Norfolk was last listed 1823.

Ramseyer was later released in 1874 and pioneered the Christian mission in Kumasi and the rest of Asante. Apart from his evangelism, Ramseyer was instrumental in the expansion of opportunities in the fields of education, artisan industry training, land acquisition for building design and manpower development in the Asante areas he lived and worked in.  Early life and education  Fritz Ramseyer Friedrich ‚ÄúFritz‚Äù Augustus Louis Ramseyer was born on 7 October 1840, in Neuch√¢tel in Francophone region of Switzerland. He came from a watchmaking artisan family. Dating to 1646, Ramsyer's ancestry can be traced to the Emmental in the canton of Bern, known for its cheese-making industry. There is a village named Ramsei in Emmental, a valley in West Central Switzerland surrounded by limestone-rich ranges of the Jura Mountains. The Kwahu mountain range in Ghana is analogous in topography to the Jura Mountains. His father was Louis Adolph Ramseyer (1828 ‚Äì1872) from Grandval, Moutier District in Bern. His mother was Marie Ramseyer, n√©e Wuersten (1830 ‚Äì1892), from Le Locle in Neuch√¢tel. Fritz Ramseyer's paternal grandparents were David Ludwig Ramseyer and Suzanne Marquerite Guerne, both of Bern. Rasmeyer had seven siblings, including Emma Aline Fiechter; Reynold Ramseyer; Hermann Ramseyer; Achilles Adolph Ramseyer; Elina Georgina Ramseyer and Lise Ramseyer. At the age of eighteen, he studied German at a college where he became interested in missionary work and was involved in a Christian Youth Group, before completing his mandatory military service. Taking after his father who was a building contractor, Ramseyer trained as a builder and a mason in his hometown. In 1861, when he was twenty-one years old, he proceeded to the Basel Mission Seminary in Basel, Switzerland to train as a mission technical staff. In 1864, Fritz Ramseyer arrived on the Gold Coast for the first time to assist the mission in its structural work, completing the construction of the Basel Mission Seminary buildings at Akropong. The Basel Mission then appointed Ramseyer the principal of the boys‚Äô middle school at Akropong, where he began to learn the Twi language. He was later ordained a Protestant minister during a furlough home in 1875.  Work on the Gold Coast  = Socio-political context = In 1865, the British colonial government was contemplating abandoning the Gold Coast as a colony due to perceived economic unviability in the impenetrable forested middle belt of Ghana. Eager to keep its missionary presence on the Gold Coast, the Basel Mission Home Committee assigned one of its missionaries, Elias Schrenk (1831‚Äì1913) , on a fact-finding and diplomatic task; proving to Westminster that the development of infrastructure, particularly roads would open up the natural resource-rich forest Akan hinterland. He sailed to London and argued his case before the parliamentary committee after petitioning the Colonial Secretary. Schrenk was successful in his mission and the Gold Coast remained a British colony. Between 1854 and 1859, Elias Schrenk studied at the Basel Mission Seminary in Switzerland before embarking to Ghana, where he lived until 1872. Schrenk, a believer in Pietist faith healing, was the General Treasurer of the Basel Mission Trading Company in Christiansborg and later experimented with cocoa planting in the early 1870s in Ghana. Gravely ill in 1858, Schrenk had visited faith healers in Germany, Johann Blumhardt at Bad Boll and subsequently Dorothea Trudel at Mannedorf between 1858 and March 1859, where he was fully healed. In mapping out a route to Kumasi, the missionaries considered two options. Firstly, they sought to build up a focal station in Kyebi, the capital of the humid and densely-forested Akyem area ‚Äì a region with a non- conducive climate to European missionaries. The Akyem paramount chieftain or Okyehene, Nana Amoako Atta I, was hostile to the work of the Basel missionaries. Atta owned 100 to 200 slaves who had converted to Christianity and had been freed by the British colonial authorities. Amoako Atta lost his revenue as a result. Eventually, he was exiled to Nigeria on charges of cruelty. The chief in turn accused the converts of pilfering ¬£3500. After his sudden death, Christians were banished from the town and the chiefdom seized the mission station and chapel using them as the new king‚Äôs official residence and durbar hall respectively. Amid various skirmishes, colonial soldiers stormed the town and restored law and order, leading to the eventual flourishing of the mission at the beginning of the twentieth century. The alternative chartered route to Asante was through the Northern Kwahu Mountains, where the Basel missionaries had set up a mission station. The insights into the terrain were gleaned by Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer during their capture in 1869 by the Asante army during their forced march from Anum, located on the Volta River‚Äôs eastern bank to Kumasi, via the Kwahu State where the mountain range is situated. Thus, they were able to acquaint themselves with the topography during the journey to the Asante capital. Earlier in 1868, Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer were sent to Anum to aid in the operationalisation of the new mission station there. Their captivity also allowed them to observe firsthand Asante geography, culture, customs, political philosophy and statecraft. Based on their experiences, the Ramseyer couple were well suited to act as consultants to the Basel Mission as the society made plans for establish a mission station in Asante. The subsequent propagation of the Gospel in Kumasi, by the Basel missionaries paved the way for mission work in the western and northern parts of the country until World War I. The mission had a presence at Yendi ‚Äì homeland of the Dagomba people, by 1913 and were in the early stages moving eastwards towards Northern Togoland. There were pockets of Christian communities along the away that had been pioneered by native alumni of Basel mission ‚Äìeducation system along the coast. An example of a town that had Christian coverts, was Tamale, a town that had 6000 inhabitants in 1914. On 25 December ‚Äì Christmas Day, passages from the Nativity of Jesus were narrated in the Dagbani language for the first time. The First World War terminated the activities of the Basel mission on the Gold Coast as the Germans were opponents of the British during the war. The Basel missionaries who were mostly German or Swiss German were expelled from the colony. The Colonial Secretary wrote to G. Zurcher, the General Superintendent of the Basel Mission on the Gold Coast on 10 December 1917 with a deportation order. A propaganda piece by now-defunct Cape Coast-based newspaper, the Gold Coast Leader published in May 1917 accused the German missionaries of ‚Äúseeking to persuade the people of the inevitability of a German victory.‚Äù The missionaries were summoned to Accra in the second week of December 1917 and deported on 16 December 1917. Eight missionaries, six Swiss, one Australian and one American, were forced to leave the Gold Coast. They were H. Stricker who was in charge of the Akropong College, G. Zurcher and H. Dewald at Chritiansborg, P. Dieterle at the Abokobi station, E. Scherrer of the Aburi station, N. Rhode and H. Henking at Abetifi and F. Jost at the Kumasi station. On 12 January 1918, it became unlawful for any European missionary to remain in Akuapem. By 2 February 1918, the Secretary of State in London had ordered all Basel missionaries to exit the Gold Coast with immediate effect. The colonial government also confiscated all Basel mission assets on the Gold Coast. Missionaries from the United Free Church of Scotland, who were then based in Calabar, Nigeria took over the operations of the Basel mission‚Äôs practice in Ghana. A new structure was set up handing over administration of the mission to Ghanaians, under a new name, the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast. = Life in captivity = On 12 June 1869, Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer, together with their nine-month old son, Fritzchen, were captured by the Asante troops led by the army captain, Aduboffour while on their first official assignment in Anum. Ramseyer and his family had arrived in Anum on 29 December 1868. He was put in charge of the mission station and the church there. The Asante army were in Anum at the behest of the Akwamuhene to join the war against the Krepis, now Peki in 1868. The Asante army defeated the Anum commune in the tribal conflict. The Akwamu used the war against Peki to punish their neighbour, Anum. On rumours of war in Anum, Ramseyer noted in his diary, ‚ÄúWe scarcely believed anything we heard, and concluded that as there was still a mixed population of young and old left in the town, the danger could not be imminent.‚Äù The Ramseyers hoped the cordial relationship between them and the natives of Anum would insulate them from the war. He believed that the enemy was only interested in material wealth so he hid jewellery and about ¬£200 in the backyard garden. Ramseyer further stated, ‚ÄúNo idea of imprisonment or captivity in Coomassie [Kumasi] ever occurred to us.‚Äù His fellow missionaries in Ho were willing to host Rosa Ramseyer and their baby but she refused to leave her husband given the uncertainties. Also taken in as captive of the Asante was the Brother Johannes K√ºhne, a Prussian who was a technical mission staff of the Basel Mission whose main responsibility included the industrial processing and export of cotton from the Gold Coast to Europe. The main site of the cotton ginning was Labolabo, a village near Anum. The Ramseyers and K√ºhne were taken on foot from the Volta Region through the Afram Plains and the Kwahu Range and finally to the Asante capital, Kumasi. After several weeks of walking, the captives arrived on the outskirts of Kumasi in a small hamlet called Abankoro, where they were joined by the French merchant, Marie-Joseph Bonnat who had been captured in Ho, a few miles from the Ghana-Togo frontier. Abankoro was a transit point for prisoners as Asante customs required waiting there for many weeks or months before the captives were presented before the Asante king. The prisoners were housed in a traditional hut which Fritz Ramseyer christened ‚ÄúEbenezer‚Äù, meaning ‚ÄúThus far the Lord had brought us‚Äù. The name, Ebenezer, became commonplace in Ghana for religious buildings such as the stone-built Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, Osu which was constructed by the Basel Mission in 1902. A small museum was built next to the central shrine of Abetifi by the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board as a testament of the first dwelling of the Ramseyers at Abetifi and a symbol of interreligious dialogue between traditionalists and Christians. At Abankoro, the Asante soldiers removed the iron shackles around the captives‚Äô ankles which had become sore from the long trek. At this point, their clothing and footwear were completely worn out and in tatters. The absence of proper washing and soap resulted in skin rashes. Carbuncles festered on Rosa Ramseyer‚Äôs scalp as she had no access to a hair comb and a pair of scissors. The captives were also bitten by several insects along the way. The escort leader of the prisoners, Ageana was noted for his cruelty. The missionaries wrote accounts of the reception of local chiefs and their subjects as they passed through the towns and villages within the Gold Coast territory. Fritzchen Ramseyer, the infant son of the Ramseyers died from malnutrition when the party was close to Juaben/Asokore. His remains were buried under a banana tree on the periphery of Asokore, in the infant cemetery. To the Ramseyers, they perceived their son‚Äôs death as ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs will‚Äù. The prisoners trekked through Kwahu/Tafo and Bokuruwa, a rocky terrain characterized by chiselled basalt. The group stopped in Abetifi for two days for a brief respite. At Abetifi, they were warmly received by the paramount chief and the townsfolk. On arrival at their final destination, Kumasi, they were allocated a former Methodist station for lodging. They were treated with respect by the Asantehene, Otumfuo Kofi Karikari who periodically sent the political prisoners the occasional sheep, food items and gold dust equivalent to ¬£9 when the Asantehene celebrated the adae festivals bi-weekly. On 12 January 1871, Ramseyer celebrated the Adae festival where he paid his respect to the third court of the palace. The Asante stool gave the captives a parcel of land for farming. The Asantehene realised that Bonnat and Ramseyer had the technical knowhow in advanced building technology and used them to construct stone lodges. Some scholars have posited that the Asante king must have realised that the missionaries were not mercenaries trading in ammunition to enemy states of the Asante. The Basel Mission policy did not allow its agents to sell arms. The European hostages were used as political pawns in the Anglo- Ashanti impasse. Though the British Governor attempted to negotiate their freedom, he was hindered by the fact that the missionaries were not British subjects. Secondly, they were captured in commune east of the Volta River which was under German rule at the time. The Asante kingdom proposed a ransom of ¬£2000 and later reduced the fee to ¬£1000. Ramseyer rejected this option since in his view, paying a ransom in exchange for their freedom ‚Äúwould only reinforce the immoral habit of abducting people for ransom.‚Äù The negotiations stalled for almost half-a-decade. However, the Asante permitted them to preach on a limited basis and start an infant school. In the royal household at the Manhyia Palace, the missionaries found a diplomatic ally in Owusu Ansa, a Western-educated prince whose father, Osei Bonsu (1801‚Äì1824) had been the Asantehene. Owusu Ansa had previously been handed over to the British as surety in a peace accord that was signed by the British and the Asante authorities at the conclusion of one of the many Anglo-Asante wars of that era. He was then taken to England where he was baptised in the Anglican faith and received formal education. On his return to his homeland, Kumasi in 1841, he assumed a new role as a diplomatic envoy between the British Governor and the Asantehene. As the de facto ambassador of the Ashanti in Cape Coast, he was the intermediary through whom the prisoners could receive presents and letters from their families and friends in Europe. Drawing on his interactions with Wesleyan missionaries whose schools had to close at Cape Coast due to lack of adult enrollment, Owusu Ansa advised Ramseyer to start an infant school and a nursery for the church instead. In captivity, Ramseyer ate local foods like the Asante delicacy, fufu and used local accessories such as a traditional stool, local water bottle and a large calabash used for bathing. He also became socially acquainted to the traditional festivals and customs. As a missionary, he co-existed with fetish priests in Kwaso and Abetifi. He also used shrine drums as a call to worship in his preaching as a prisoner in Asante which proved an effect method in proselytism. He also pioneered the propagation of the Gospel to royal courtiers in the ‚ÄúMission to Palace‚Äù initiative which is now a contemporary feature of the Presbyterian Church‚Äôs ministry in Asante. In 1871, David Asante, the first native Akan missionary of the Basel Mission was sent on a fact-finding expedition in Begoro, north of Kyebi, one of the divisions of the Akyem Abuakwa State to gather details about Ramseyer and K√ºhne. Nothing came of this activity. David Asante later visited Kumasi, where he met Ramseyer when the latter was working as a free missionary. The missionaries were finally considered for release in January 1874, when it became clear the Asante army had lost a key battle against the British, more commonly known as the Sargrenti War (1873‚Äì74) led by Sir Garnet Wolseley, an Anglo-Irish field marshal. Approximately 2500 British troops burned down Kumasi on 4 February 1874. The Asante king ordered the release of the Basel missionaries as they were no longer useful political prisoners. As part of the reparation settlement, the vanquished Asante kingdom was required to pay the victor, the British, fifty thousand ounces of gold. The capture of the Protestant missionaries made international news in German-speaking areas of Europe. Marie-Joseph Bonnat‚Äôs magnum opus, a record of his years in captivity was found in 1979 in an attic in his old family lodge in his hometown, Gri√®ges in the French department of Ain. The content of the manuscript validated the Ramseyers‚Äô accounts of their captivity, even though the narrative was written from two perspectives, that of a Swiss Protestant missionary and a Catholic French trader/prospector, united by a strong belief in Christian teaching. The work was edited by Albert van Dantzig and Claude- H√©l√®ne Perrot and published as Marie-Joseph et les Ashanti in 1994. Johannes K√ºhne, whose health deteriorated in captivity, was immediately repatriated to Europe after their liberation in 1874. Later, the diaries of Ramseyer/K√ºhne, translated into French and English, were published in Europe and the books became instant bestsellers. In Ramseyer‚Äôs diary, he noted that he witnessed 2000 to 3000 slaves, prisoners of war and criminals being used as human sacrifices during his years in captivity in Kumasi. Though their stories were not the first European account of the culture and politics of the Asante, they provided a personable anthropological narrative as observed by the captives. The earliest illustration of the Asante by a European was carried out by the British envoy, Thomas Edward Bowdich in 1817. = Missionary activities = Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer in Abetifi Upon their release, the Ramseyers went back to Switzerland to rest. The Ramseyers wished to return to Kumasi in 1874 as liberated missionaries but the political climate was not favourable to foreigners, especially former political prisoners. Besides, the Home Committee wanted them to wait due to the political situation Fritz Ramseyer decided to create a mission post right outside the Asante jurisdiction. The Ramseyers returned to the Gold Coast at the end of 1875 and initially settled at Kyebi in Akyem Abuakwa. With the approval of the Home Committee, he selected the mountainous Abetifi, situated on the Kwahu Ridge at an altitude of 600 metres above sea level. He had also considered setting up the mission base in Obo Kwahu, about three hours from Abetifi. There were also rumours that Kwahu desired to leave the Asante confederacy due to Ashanti‚Äôs taxation policy of salt and gunpowder. Furthermore, Ramseyer did not want to another political imbroglio. The township was known for being hospitable to foreigners. The Ramseyers were temporarily settled at the Kubasehene Yaw Preko‚Äôs house and fetish shrine under the auspices of the paramount chieftain of Abetifi, Nana Kofi Dankyi. Ramseyer had earlier stayed in this house as a captive on the march to Kumasi. Ramseyer started his school and fellowship in this same house, propagating the Gospel among the people. He sometimes held open-air vigils and religious revivals where many natives, including fetish priests, Agya Yaw Tawi and Otuo Kofi converted to Christianity. By 12 March 1877, the natives Ramseyer had baptised included Yaw Beeko and his wife, Buruwa, Otieku Kwadwo, Taetta and his wife, Ansaa, Jonathan Kofi Brebo and his wife, Akosua Angyie, Kwabena Gyane and his wife, Ansaa and Osei Yaw. They were first congregants at the church Ramseyer established at Abetifi. Ramseyer asked the Abetifi traditional authorities for a parcel of land to build a mission station. This move was opposed by the local shamans who viewed Ramseyer as a threat to their livelihoods as many indigenes were abandoning the traditional religion in favour of the Christian faith. On 5 February 1876, Ramseyer bought a plot of land from the Kubeasehene, Yaw Preko at a cost of ¬£110. Coordinating the logistics for a mission outpost was difficult as transportation access to the town was spotty in that period. As the nearest major locale to Kumasi, the Basel Mission Home Committee was eager to establish a mission station in Abetifi as a springboard for further evangelism in Asante. It therefore imported hundred professional builders and labourers from Akropong in 1876 to build a mission house and chapel. Perched atop a hill, the two-storied eighteen-room structure built with limestone and solid timber, was consecrated in 1878. The doors and windows were made of wood as were the shingles used for roofing. Rainstorm nearly damaged the building during construction, requiring reinforcement with wooden beams on the upper level using the architectural engineering, commonly found in Switzerland and Germany, distinct for English- style Tudor houses. The building is still in use by the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and it underwent refurbishment in 1998‚Äì99. Ramseyer also considered nearby towns, Bompata and Petrensa as alternative towns to establish temporary mission station before the entry to Kumasi. Ramseyer trained the native converts to become catechists to assist him in his missionary work. He tasked two native converts, Samuel K. Boateng and James Boama to oversee the operations of these two outposts. Today, catechists of the church are put-in- charge of congregations with no substantive ministers. The system helped in the numerical growth of the Presbyterian church of the Gold Coast. In August 1876, Ramseyer started the Kwahu Tafo mission station and later in December 1876, the outpost at Bokuruwa was established. Moreover, in the Kwahu area, Fritz Ramseyer met and worked with Peter Hall, the son of West Indian missionaries, John and Mary Hall, recruited by Danish minister, Andreas Riis and had arrived on the Gold Coast from Jamaica in 1843 under the auspices of the Basel Mission. Peter Hall was elected the first Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1922. There was always the constant fear of an insurgency by the Asante since Kwahu had become a political possession of Asante. Besides, Ramseyer suffered ill-health leading to a periodic home leave in Europe. On 1 October 1871, through an arrangement made by a personal friend of Ramseyer and a member of the Asante royal family, Bosommuru, Fritz Ramseyer held his first open-air service on Asante soil. About hundred people gathered to listen to his message. Earlier in 1877, in his report to Basel, Ramseyer stated that he and colleagues had started three schools with a total population of 311 pupils. By 1890, they had established eight schools, six outposts that housed more than 200 Christian converts. In September 1881, Ramseyer went to Kumasi with the Basel missionary, Joseph Mohr. They received a warm reception from the Asantehene who treated him as an old long-lost friend and presented to the king a Twi language Bible that had been translated by Johann Gottlieb Christaller, the German philologist and Basel missionary. The Asantehene, nonetheless, declined the gift. Other sources state that he presented an English Bible to the king a decade earlier on 29 June 1871. The permanent station in Kumasi was yet to be set up by Ramseyer due to the political atmosphere of that time. In 1882, Ramseyer and David Asante tried again to go to Kumasi with the objective of setting up a mission station; their attempt however failed. During this period, there was stool disputes in Juaben and Bekwai within the Asante confederacy making mission work in Kumasi unsafe. On 28 January 1876, Basel missionaries, Fritz Ramseyer, Christian Eugene Wermer (mission dyer born on (8 April 1851), Jacob Weiner (mission carpenter born on 9 February 1850), Joseph Mohr and David Asante entered Abetifi en route to Kumasi. A political situation in 1896 necessitated the return of Fritz Ramseyer to Kumasi. This was twenty-two years after he had been released from captivity. The Asante stool represented by the Asantehene, Otumfuo Agyemang Prempeh I, owed the British crown five thousand ounces of gold, as part of the treaty of Fomena, after it lost one of the Anglo-Asante wars. British soldiers were advancing towards Kumasi to intimidate the Asantehene. Among other demands, the British wanted the Asante Kingdom to become a British protectorate under the Gold Coast colony. Prempeh remembered Fritz Ramseyer and requested that his services as an arbiter in the impasse. However, the British troops had by then stormed Kumasi. The Asantehene, the Queen mother and royal courtiers were captured and taken into exile at the Elmina Castle and later to the Seychelles. In the aftermath, the colonial forces built a fortress in the Asante capital. The British Governor granted the Ramseyers permission to settle in Kumasi and build a mission station. On 21 February 1896, in a letter to Basel, Ramseyer wrote, ‚ÄúIt is no longer a dream. Today, my wife and my nephew [Edmond] Perregaux have [been permitted] to move to Kumasi. The town has become a Basel Mission station. The land is open for us to work!‚Äù In June 1896, Rosa and Fritz Ramseyer, together with their nephew, Edmond Perregaux and Joseph Adjaye, a local Christian convert completed their move to Kumasi. In July 1896, a mission station was subsequently constructed on a plot of land at Bantama acquired by Ramseyer with the blessing of the Asantehene and the chieftain, Bantamahene under whose jurisdiction Bantama was located. Notable among his converts was Kofi Karikari (1862‚Äì1953), a royal courtier in the Osodo division, the culinary department of the Asantehene‚Äôs household kitchen who became one of the first congregants of the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church and the first Presbyter of Asante. After his conversion and subsequent baptism, he became Andreas Karikari and assisted Ramseyer in evangelistic travels as an itinerant preacher. Ramseyer also carried out missionary work at Kwaso, a town near Ejisu in Ashanti. He established a Basel Mission church there which now bears his name. Some of his first converts at Kwaso include Kofi Dom, J. C. Oppong, Yaw Amofah, Kofi Mensah, Abena Buruwaa and Afia Ohu, the wife of Kwame Wora. By December 1896, Ramseyer had opened two outstations and schools in Kwaso and Bekwaman in 1896. The Kwaso Presbyterian Primary School started in 1898 as a successor to the institution Ramseyer founded in 1896. His wife, Rosa Ramseyer played a pivotal role in the girls‚Äô education programme in Asante, teaching domestic science such as sewing, baking and household chores. At Kwaso, Ramseyer was hosted by Opanin Kwame Wura whose two associates, Agya Apea and Opanin Dwamena became his Ramseyer‚Äôs interpreters and tutors in the Twi language. Overall, by 1898, the Basel Mission had 128 schools with a student population of 500 and 157 churches with nearly 17000 congregants. By 1899, Kumasi had seen 33 baptisms and 160 Christian converts, mostly indigenes from outside the city, were living there. Seventeen mission stations had also been established in Asante with Kumasi being the focal point, with fifteen Basel mission schools in Asante in 1900. By 1914, the Kwahu station had 2582 congregants in 21 churches, Bompata had a Salem Christian village quarter and the Akim outpost had 3400 Christians in 32 villages with 900 pupils enrolled in 27 schools. Drunkenness and polygamy which were at odds with Protestant piety made the mission work challenging to Ramseyer. Some converts reverted to worshipping their local deities such as Atia, Aberewa, Tigari and Hwe-me-so. Several Muslims settled in Kumasi after the Yaa Asantewaa war, giving rise to the ‚ÄúZongo‚Äù community in the city. The missionaries feared the influx of Islam may hamper their Christian evangelism efforts. Many of the converts from Asante were reluctant to train as teachers after their basic education. The Basel Mission therefore had to recruit teachers from Akwapim, Akyem, Kwahu, Ga and Krobo for the schools Ramseyer and his colleagues built in Asante territories. In March 1900, the political atmosphere worsened again when the British colonial administrators led by the British Governor, Sir Frederick Mitchell Hodgson, demanded the relinquishing of the ‚ÄúGolden Stool‚Äù, the most sacred symbol of traditional authority of the Asante. Hodgson had succeeded Maxwell Scott as the British Governor in 1897. In the view of the Governor, the Golden Stool was now a property of the Crown as the kingdom was now a British Protectorate. The ensuing melee was the Yaa Asantewaa War in 1901 spearheaded by Yaa Asantewaa, the Queen of Ejisu. The Ramseyer family, together with other foreigners such as Mr. and Mrs. Jost and Mr. Weller, sought shelter at the new garrison built by the British in Kumasi. Three native teachers of the Basel mission died during the war: Maxwell Okanta and Helena Sakyiama, both whom died of starvation at the fort and Samuel Out who was beheaded at Takyimantia. The uprising lasted for two months and food supplies began to run out. The refugees including the Ramseyers had to escape in the dead of the night to the coast. Rosa Ramseyer, who was by then partly paralysed due earlier complications during pregnancy and childbirth, was carried by porters, throughout the journey. Kumasi was razed to the ground, destroying the Basel and Wesleyan mission station as the colonial forces quelled the revolt. The soldiers stole several properties of the mission including furniture and kitchenware. According to scholars, domestic slaves who had been freed by the British administration in 1896 and were enrolled in Ramseyer‚Äôs school were most likely re-taken into slavery by the Asante army after the Yaa Asantewaa War. One of the peace treaties signed after the war between the British and the Asante stipulated that ‚Äúthe Christian missions should be allowed freedom to preach and open schools.‚Äù The colonial government maintained a strong military presence after the war had ended in order to maintain law and order. After this episode, the Ramseyers went to Aburi for a short period before going to Switzerland for furlough. The missionaries returned to Kumasi on 13 December 1901 for a fourth time and rebuilt the mission house, school and parish church, now named Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church, located on Mission Road in the suburb of Adum, formerly known as Dareboase. The chapel was christened ‚ÄúEbenezer‚Äù a reference to the Biblical verse in 1 Samuel 7:12, ‚Äúhow far the Lord has helped us‚Äù- an allusion to the pain, suffering and tribulations the Ramseyers had endured in Asante. This time, they were assisted by other Basel missionaries, I. Bellon, Karl Epting, missionary-architect and African pastors, Nathanael V. Asare and Samuel Kwafo. In 1907, the Basel Mission House was built. It was dubbed ‚Äúa second fort in Kumasi‚Äù by the Chief Commissioner of Asante. Ramseyer carried out mission work in Ejisu, Atebubu, Nkoranza, Wankyi, Sekwa and Berekum. One of Ramseyer‚Äôs colleagues, A. P. Bauer spent five years as a missionary in the Nsuta township from 1904‚Äì09. Other Basel missionaries who worked in Asante include A Jehle, A. Lipps and F. Jost. Non-European missionaries and clergymen who aided and built upon Ramseyer‚Äôs work include, H. J. Keteku, H. Dako, B. O. Ampofo, Nicholas Timothy Clerk, A. O. Mate, J. Dwamena, James Boama, C. E. Opoku, M. Ape, B. M. Seku A. Y. Yeboah, A. Anane, Amo Gottfried and Sam Prempeh. In his final tour of duty, Fritz Ramseyer lived in Kumasi from 1906 until 1908, before permanently returning to his home country, Switzerland, after forty-four years residing on the Gold Coast. Ramseyer perceived his time in captivity as a preparatory period sanctioned by providence, for evangelism in Asante. = Artisan training and industry development = Ramseyer provided artisan training to the natives, especially in housing design and building technology that was commonplace in 19th century Switzerland. He trained Papa Mends in carpentry and the latter came to be known as ‚ÄúCarpenter Mends‚Äù due to his dexterity. He also trained a native of Antoa, Agya Oduro in carpentry. Many of his converts left their long-grass thatch roof, bamboo poles and beam huts and moved into the newly designed stone storey houses at the mission station in Adum. Ramseyer earned the nickname \\"Osiadan\\" (meaning the builder), which echoed a similar name given to Andreas Riis in Akropong in the 1840s. Ramseyer‚Äôs handiwork also included the chapels and mission stations at Abetifi, Anum, Kumasi and Kwaso which all have similar architecture. The chapel at Abetifi was modified and is now used as a library by the Abetifi campus of the Presbyterian University College. The chapel at Kumasi is used by the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church. The building at Anum is used as an administration block by the Presbyterian Senior High School there while the one at Abetifi is the main administration block for the Ramseyer Training Centre. The building at Kumasi is used as Guest House by the Asante Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. Ramseyer also acquired lands at Abetifi, Bompata and Kumasi for the church as a whole which are now used by the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. The land at Adum, Kumasi now houses various offices and official residence of the church officials such as Presbytery chairmen, regional manager of Presbyterian schools, Presbyterian basic school, Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church, ministers‚Äô manses and a book depot called A-Riis Company Limited. Previously, this piece of land was used as a burial ground for outcasts, slaves and criminals and was not fit for human settlement. As the mission station expanded, the site attracted commercial ventures which aided the socio-economic development of the church. = Photography = Fritz Ramseyer was also an amateur photographer, taking photographs of the Gold Coast, as early as 1888. He used industrially prepared negative films. A few of the pictures may have been printed on the Gold Coast while a large number was sent to the Basel Mission in Switzerland for processing. These photographs have been used at numerous lectures and in various academic books, brochures and magazines for the purposes of illustration. Fritz Ramseyer was the author and publisher of the first photography book about the Gold Coast. The book was published in his hometown, Neuch√¢tel in 1895 and comprised ‚Äú80 views of missionary life, the indigenous culture and local personalities‚Äù.  Personal life  Mrs. Ramseyer giving sewing classes on her veranda in Kumasi. Rosa Ramseyer, n√©e Bontemps On 8 February 1866, Fritz Ramseyer married Rosa Louise Bontemps at Christiansborg, Gold Coast. She was born on 7 July 1841 to Henri Louis Fran√ßois Bontemps. Rosa Ramseyer, was a native of Valangin in the canton of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland and had trained in both England and Basel to become a missionary. In the autumn of 1868, Rosa Ramseyer gave birth to Fritz Junior, affectionately called ‚ÄúFritzchen‚Äù. During their time in Kumasi, Rosa Ramseyer gave birth to twins, one of whom died. Overall, they had eight children but four died in childhood. Records indicate that two his children were named Rose Ramseyer and Rudolf J. Ramseyer. As a result of her ordeal in captivity, Rosa Ramseyer became partially paralysed and her health condition deteriorated over time, permanently leaving the Gold Coast in 1904. Rosa Ramseyer eventually died in Switzerland in 1906. Fritz Ramseyer re-married in 1908 to a fifty-nine year old Swiss woman called Elisa Uranie Bornand, whose father was Justin Bornard. Ramseyer‚Äôs nephew, Edmond Perregaux died in Kumasi in 1905.

Frits Ramseyer  Death, memorials and legacy  Fritz Ramseyer died from a heart attack on 6 August 1914, aged 73, in Switzerland. There are a number of institutions in Ghana that have been named in the memory of Fritz and Rosa Ramseyer. These include the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church and the Ramseyer Vocational and Technical Centre, both in Kumasi as well as Ramseyer Presbyterian Training Centre and the Ramseyer Retreat Centre, both in Abetifi. The Ramseyer Memorial Swiss School in Accra was also named in his honour. A boarding house, Ramseyer House in Prempeh College was named in his honour. Other Presbyterian churches named after him include those at Bubiashie, North Kaneshie, Kwaso, Dansoman, Bompata, Wiaso, Kwahu-Tafo, Kwahu-Bokruwa, Nkwatia Kwahu, Abetifi-Kwahu, Hansua-Techiman and in Columbus, Ohio. Fritz Ramseyer also had a complex legacy: In his mission work, he was perceived by his colleagues as having autocratic tendencies with a domineering personality. This made him too harsh and difficult to work with as he became very impatient when things did not go his way. His evangelistic zeal, belief in the inerrancy and centrality of Scripture as well as his strong sense of Christian fellowship shaped by his Pietist upbringing helped spread the Protestant faith in Asante and the ‚Äútransformation of indigenous lives and social institutions.‚Äù A commemorative marble plate at the Ramseyer Memorial Presbyterian Church was erected in honour of Rosa Ramseyer. Marie-Joseph Bonnat, the French adventurer and a co-captive of the Ramseyers noted in his diary, ‚ÄúMr. R. was the most sincere man I have ever met, a fine example of humanity! Mrs. R. was just like her husband a very good person, even if she appeared at times nervous. The poor lady may well be excused for this, when one takes into account how much she had been put to test. She was an energetic woman, who endured her trials with courage and fortitude.‚Äù  Literature  * Claude-H√©l√®ne Perrot, Albert Van Dantzig (1994) Marie-Joseph Bonnat et les Ashanti ‚Äì Journal (1869‚Äì1874) M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© des Africanistes.

The prototype first flew as the Yokosho 2-Go (long designation: ) in 1929. The aircraft was a single-seat biplane that could be quickly assembled and disassembled so that it could be stored on board a submarine. Two prototypes were built that differed in power plant and design details. Eight production machines followed with the designation E6Y built by Kawanishi in the 1930s and served with the Japanese submarine aircraft carriers , , and . They saw limited action during the January 28 incident and the Second Sino-Japanese War, the last example being retired in 1943. Development The Imperial Japanese Navy was a pioneer in naval aviation, starting as early as 1912 with the purchase of two floatplanes from Britain and one from the United States. By December 1922, Japan had completed H≈çsh≈ç, which vies with as the first ship purpose-designed for aircraft operations. Alongside that development, the Navy also looked at aircraft as a way to extend the operational reach of their large submarine force. Aware of the challenge of operations in the large expanse of the Pacific Ocean, the Navy was particularly looking at ways to improve their reconnaissance capability and saw submarine-based aircraft as a complement to landbased patrol. They acquired a German Caspar U.1 from the United States and a Parnall Peto from Britain, both early submarine-based reconnaissance aircraft. The two aircraft formed the basis for two prototype Japanese aircraft built for submarine-based reconnaissance, the 1-Go based on the former, while the latter heavily influenced the 2-Go. Design The , which was abbreviated to Yokosho, developed the 2-Go as a smaller aircraft that the Peto. It was a biplane of mixed construction, with a steel frame and wooden- framed wings, covered in canvas. The wings were designed to detach for storage, as was the twin float assembly, which was also wooden. The first prototype was powered by the same engine as the Peto, an Armstrong Siddeley Mongoose five-cylinder radial engine, rated at , but manufactured under license by Mitsubishi. The second prototype, designated 2-Go Kai, differed in a number of details. Lateral stability issues were resolved by increasing the tail fin and rudder, extending them upward. The aircraft was fitted with a more powerful Japanese seven-cylinder radial, rated at , which gave a maximum speed of and four and a half hours endurance. In 1931, the Kawanishi Aircraft Company was commissioned to produce eight production machines, designated E6Y1, based on the 2-Go Kai, which were built between 1932 and 1934. Operational history The submarine I-5, which carried the E6Y The Navy took delivery of the 2-Go in May 1929 and initially tested it aboard the submarine . Testing was completed by September 1931. The 2-Go Kai commenced testing in 1931 initially also on board I-51 and then subsequently the Junsen I Mod type submarine . I-5 was not fitted with a hangar, but rather the aircraft was disassembled and stored in two cylindrical containers, one for the fuselage and the other for the wings, stored on the deck. Launch was initially from the water, but a catapult was fitted to I-5 in 1933 and this was found more satisfactory. All subsequent Japanese aircraft-carrying submarines used catapults. The first production E6Y entered service in 1933, and the eight aircraft were deployed to the three Junsen II and III submarines, , and . The aircraft also saw surface ship use. They saw limited service during the January 28 incident in 1932, providing reconnaissance, and subsequently there are reports that they served on submarines that operated during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Between 1937 and 1938, submarines I-5 and I6 were assigned to the Third Fleet (China Theatre Fleet) based at Hong Kong to patrol and blockade the central and southern Chinese coasts. As the Japanese Navy introduced larger aircraft carrying submarines, the E6Y was superseded by the Watanabe E9W. The last example retired in 1943.

CE 754 that is located in the Biblioth√®que Municipale at Autun, France. This artifact consists primarily of the Four Gospels and contains a variety of medieval artistic illustrations / depictions including decorated initials, Roman influenced pillars surrounding canon tables, a Maiestas Domini illustration, and four Evangelists portraits.247x247px  The Maiestas Domini Illustration  Contained within the Gundohinus Gospels is a miniature of the Maiestas Domini.File:Autun ms3 12v.jpg The subject matter of this page has been described as having a larger centered circle or roundel with four smaller circles or medallions located around the center, as if to form a rectangular type of box frame. In the center circle is a depiction of Christ, seated on a throne while holding a book in one hand and offered the sign of peace or blessing with the other. Standing on either side of Christ are angels with one hand each upon the throne of Christ and eyes focused on intently onto him. Within the four corner medallions are four \\"beasts\\" that portray representations of the four Evangelists. In the upper left corner is the Man of Matthew, the upper right corner being the Lion of Mark, the lower left corner depicts the Bull of Luke, while the lower right corner symbolizes the Eagle of John.  Decorated Initials  Example of decorated script from Gundohinus Gospels Throughout the Gundohinus Gospels, there are a number of decorated initials that appear either as capital letters or as majuscule script, and are largely composed of animals or beast-like creatures - making up the lines or curvature of the letter being illustrated. One example of this style (shown to the left) is through the use of a bird to indicate the side of the letter \\"C\\". It is thought that this style has its origination with Roman scriptoria and can be seen in other 8th-Century Merovingian manuscripts.  Canon Tables  Canon Tables of Gundohinus Gospels The Gundohinus Gospels contains twelve pages of canon tables which were meant to be used to determine which religious passages were shared within which of the Four Gospels. The canon tables (shown to the right) are framed with Roman style pillars or columns with four concentric arches - one over each of the four gospels. The open spaces of the arches are filled with illustrations of leaves and vines, while the columns themselves contain repetitive designs flowing vertically of either geometric shapes or curved scroll like artistry. Unlike the decorated initials previously noted, it does not appear that the use of animals or beasts appear anywhere on the framework surrounding the gospels nor within the script of the gospel citations themselves.  Portraits of the Four Evangelists  Relevant to the gospels contained within, the Gundohinus Gospels also contains portrait type depictions of the four Evangelists; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Noteworthy is the fact that of all of the surviving Merovingian types of manuscripts, the Gundohinus Gospels is the only such religious document that provides \\"full- page\\" portraits of these evangelists. This adds to the uniqueness of the Gundohinus Gospels in regards to other such religious or other manuscripts of the medieval time period. From an iconic figural perspective, those these portraits are part of a work created in the mid-700's CE, their depiction can be compared against that of later era Carolingian empire artistic representations.

After attending several yeshivas, he was ordained in 1932 and became the leader of Slovak Neolog communities before Slovakia declared independence in 1939 and began to oppress its Jewish population. Frieder joined the Working Group, a Jewish resistance organization, and delivered a petition to President Jozef Tiso begging him to halt deportations of Jews to Poland. Frieder was involved in efforts to send relief to deportees and interview escapees to learn about the progress of the Holocaust in Poland. After the German invasion of Slovakia during the Slovak National Uprising, deportations from Slovakia resumed; Frieder was captured but managed to avoid deportation from Sereƒè concentration camp. After the war, he was appointed Chief Rabbi of Slovakia and attempted to smooth tensions between Neolog and Orthodox Jews. He died after surgery in 1946. Early life Frieder was born on 30 June 1911 in Prievidza, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, one of three children of Filip Frieder and Ru≈æena Messinger; he had a brother, Emanuel, and a sister, Gittel. After eight years of study at yeshivas in Topoƒæƒçany and Bratislava, he was ordained in 1932. He was a rabbi in Zvolen between 1933 and 1937, and later ministered to the Jewish community of Nov√© Mesto nad V√°hom. Before World War II, he was the vice-chairman of the Central Zionist Organization. He and his wife, Ru≈æena (n√©e Berl) had a son, Gideon (born in 1937), and a daughter, Gita (born in 1940). The Holocaust After the Slovak State, which declared independence in 1939, began to persecute Jews, Frieder responded by organizing soup kitchens and giving inspiring sermons. Frieder was employed by the √östred≈àa ≈Ωidov (a Judenrat) and joined the opposition movement within it, the Working Group. By this time, he was the leading Neolog rabbi in Slovakia, and the chairman of Yeshurun, the organization of Neolog communities. Frieder used his prewar acquaintance with Jozef Siv√°k, the Minister of Education, to obtain information on anti-Jewish actions. Siv√°k was probably the government official that informed the Working Group in late February 1942 about the forthcoming mass deportation of Slovak Jews. On 8 March, Frieder personally delivered a petition from Slovakia's leading rabbis to President Jozef Tiso, protesting the planned deportation. Although the Working Group was not aware of the Nazi plan to murder all Jews, they knew enough about the massacres and widespread starvation for Jews in Poland that they decried the deportation as tantamount to \\"the physical destruction of the Jews in Slovakia\\". The petition read, in part: Tiso ignored the petition; Frieder later wrote that \\"One would think that words that come from the heart could penetrate the heart. But it was not the case.\\" Despite the prohibition on Jews issuing official documents, Frieder's petition was widely duplicated and circulated among Slovak government officials, legislators, bishops, and other Catholic religious leaders. However, the Slovak government supported the deportation of Jews, so the protests were ineffective. During the first transports, only single men and women were deported; Frieder issued fraudulent marriage licenses to his congregants. Between 26 March and 20 October 1942, about 57,000 Jews, two- thirds of the Jews in Slovakia at the time, were deported. Only a few hundred survived the war. Frieder was also a key figure in the Working Group's illegal relief scheme, sending valuables and money to deported Slovak Jews via smugglers, which they could trade for food or other necessities. Because of his activity, he was arrested on 22 September 1942, but continued these efforts on his release. A letter sent to Switzerland jointly by Frieder and his Working Group colleague Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl on 1 December 1942, mentioning mass executions at Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp, was the first indication that the Working Group knew about the organized extermination of Jewish deportees. In 1943, Frieder collected testimony from an escapee from Treblinka extermination camp, which was also sent to the Working Group's contacts in Switzerland. Soon after the German invasion of Slovakia concurrent with the Slovak National Uprising in August 1944, Frieder was imprisoned in Bratislava. Released by the end of the month, he was arrested in the 28 September roundup in Bratislava and was imprisoned at Sereƒè concentration camp. Meanwhile, his family had fled to Bansk√° Bystrica, the center of the uprising. Frieder's wife and daughter were killed in a German attack on the nearby village of Star√© Hory, and his son was wounded. Frieder managed to avoid deportation from Sereƒè and survived the war. Postwar life and death After the war, Frieder returned to Bratislava shortly after the city's liberation. He took immediate action to restore Jewish community life, establishing a Yeshurun, and also practical measures to help survivors. In September, he became the chairman of the Central Union of Jewish Religious Communities in Slovakia (√öS≈ΩNO). Subsequently, he was named the Chief Rabbi of Slovakia; this angered the Orthodox faction in the country, which represented 70% of surviving Jews. Frieder found it difficult to bridge the gap between the communities, but eventually succeeded by giving the Orthodox faction control over kashrut, marriage, and halakha. He organized a conference in Bratislava for Jewish resistance during the Holocaust, speaking about the activities of the Working Group. In early 1946, he fell ill in London while traveling to raise money for relief. Upon his return to Slovakia, he was operated on by the Slovak physician and rescuer of Jews, Karel Franti≈°ek Koch. Two days later, on 21 June 1946, he died shortly before his thirty-fifth birthday, which \\"came as a shock to the community\\", according to his brother Emanuel. Armin had been slated to testify as the main witness for the prosecution at the trial of Anton Va≈°ek, a corrupt official who organized the deportation of Jews. Emanuel succeeded him as chairman of the √öS≈ΩNO, and published his brother's diaries (originally 800 pages written in Slovak and German) as To Deliver Their Souls. Frieder had been known for his embrace of Zionism, after his death, his son emigrated to Palestine.

August 10, 2018. Accessed October 6, 2018. This public-private partnership covers approximately 100 acres of land and as of September 2018, has cost about $465 million to construct. The main attractions are the Chapman Adventure Playground, the Williams Lodge, a boathouse, splash playground, great lawn, outdoor sports courts, a skate park, a wetland pond and garden, and numerous trails among other locations. There are plenty of activities for kids and adults alike. Tulsa's Gathering Place was named the Best New Attraction in the nation in 2018 through the USA Today Readers‚Äô Choice awards. In 2019, Gathering Place made Time Magazine's list of The World's 100 Greatest Places of 2019, National Geographic's list of 12 Mind-Bending Playgrounds Around the World, and the American Planning Association's list of six great public spaces in America. According to the Tulsa World, Gathering Place officials had planned for the facility to attract a million visitors per year. The actual attendance for the first ten days of operation was 155,000. The two-day grand opening attracted about 55,000 visitors.Morgan, Rhett. \\"Gathering Place part two: Tulsa Children's Museum Discovery Lab reveals new design.\\" Tulsa World. September 20, 2018. Accessed February 18, 2019. Funding The George F. Kaiser Family Foundation, supported by several corporations and local philanthropies provided the construction funds, then deeded the facility to the River Parks Authority, which will provide public oversight for the park. The Kaiser Family Foundation also created a $100 million endowment to support maintenance of the park for the next 99 years. Attractions Gathering Place supports multiple Sport Court attractions on the property. Individuals seeking out a fun game of basketball, volleyball, street soccer, or street hockey will find venues for them here. Parking is conveniently located court-side where there is space for both organized and casual players, as well as fans and spectators. The sports courts are all also equipped with night-lights to allow play to continue after dark.https://www.gatheringplace.org/attractions Gun Rights issue Gathering Place officials have implemented a policy banning individuals from carrying or using firearms in the park. According to George Kaiser, this is a legal policy because the facility is considered privately owned. However, Second Amendment advocates say that it is a public facility because its partnership with public agencies make it public. On opening day, Tulsa Police officers, acting as security, turned away a private citizen who was carrying a firearm. On the next day, the Oklahoma Second Amendment Association held a rally at Gathering Place, where the leader told the gathering that, '‚Äú(They) are going to come into compliance with state law one way or the other. We ask them to do it so we don‚Äôt have to force them to.‚ÄùSavage, William W. NonDoc, October 18, 2018. Accessed October 22, 2018. In October, Tulsa's Litigation Division Division manager, Gerry Bender, told the press that Tulsa Police will not arrest people in the park who violate the park's no gun policy because the city fears that arrests would be legally challenged. He also added, \\"‚ÄúWe maintain the legal authority to enforce all ordinances and State laws applicable to private spaces open to the public.‚Äù Future Additions =Phase II= Groundbreaking on the anchor project for phase two, Discovery Lab, occurred in February 2020. The $47 million, 50,000 square foot Discovery Lab will be a hands-on museum also featuring classrooms, a caf√©, grand plaza and 300-seat amphitheater. It is expected to be completed by the late summer of 2021. =\\"The Gateway\\" project= City officials have announced that they will begin construction of a new pedestrian bridge across the Arkansas River as soon as possible after the Phase I opening. This will replace an existing pedestrian bridge, which has been designated as \\"structurally deficient\\". Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates won a design contest to implement the project, which will be known as \\"The Gateway.\\" Few details have been released publicly. Tulsa River Parks Authority said that the project has been estimated to be completed three years after construction begins, and cost the city $24.4 million.Youngman, Clayton. \\"River Parks Authority approves Arkansas River bridge connected to Gathering Place.\\" KTUL.

Effects of 2019 Arkansas River flooding  The unusually heavy rains along the Arkansas River caused flooding, especially after it forced major releases from Keystone Dam. This raised the water level downstream above flood stage in many areas and threatened to damage the new Gathering Place, which had opened in the preceding fall, and had to close for a week, until the flood had begun to subside. Gathering Place authorities began to assess the damage and plan repairs.Canfield, Kevin. \\"Repairs to Flooding Damage Could Cost Millions.\\" Tulsa World. June 4, 2019.] Accessed November 5, 2119. The east bank of the river experienced relatively light damage, with water covering two of the five sports courts south of 31st street. After hosing off mud and debris, inspectors found no significant damage to the playing surfaces. However, the flood caused some washouts along the East Bank Trail. At 58th Street and Riverside Drive, it washed away a light stanchion. Matt Meyer, Executive Director of the Tulsa River Parks Authority, told the press that the washout showed a need to install cable-concrete type bank reinforcement. He noted that a similar project the city had done two years earlier had cost about $1,000 per linear foot. Notes  References   External links   Voices of Oklahoma interview.

Background One of three principal People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) infiltration routes, corridor 1-A crossed the Cambodian frontier near the border between Kien Phong and Ki·∫øn T∆∞·ªùng Provinces, traversed the maze of canals through the Plain of Reeds and ended in the watery wasteland called the Tri Phap (known as Base Area 470 by Allied intelligence) where those provinces join Dinh Tuong Province. A branch of corridor 1-B from the Parrot's Beak of Svay Rieng Province entered the Tri Phap from the northeast. A Viet Minh base established during the First Indochina War, the Tri Phap was partly covered with brush, with little land suitable for cultivation, essentially a swamp that over the years had been laced with permanent fortifications and hidden storage areas. No Allied force had succeeded in occupying or inflicting any serious damage to the installations or forces in the Tri Phap. Immediately after the 28 January 1973 ceasefire, South Vietnamese units in Dinh Tuong were preoccupied with maintaining security in the central and northern reaches of the province and could not divert the forces necessary to clean out the Tri Phap, even though they were aware of increased PAVN activity there. A document captured on 9 August 1973 disclosed that the Z-18 Regiment of PAVN Military Region 2 was moving into the Tri Phap from Cai Bay District in northern Dinh Tuong Province and that it would probably be replaced in Cai Bay by the Dong Thap 1 Regiment. Information in the document pertaining to planned attacks in northern Dinh Tuong was confirmed by attacks on several outposts on 8 August. Furthermore, aerial photography showed that fields north of the Tri Phap had been planted in rice, part of the PAVN's effort to become self-sustaining in the Mekong Delta. With pressure mounting along Highway 4, however, IV Corps could not then challenge the PAVN activities in and north of the Tri Phap. Nevertheless, the ARVN repulsed, with heavy losses to the PAVN, numerous battalion-sized attacks against outposts and firebases in Cay Bay, C√°i B√® and Sam Giang Districts during July and August. In the first week of September alone, PAVN casualties in the region were 144 killed, while those of the ARVN were 17 killed. The surge in PAVN attacks which continued through November, was motivated in part, by the rice harvest and marked by PAVN attempts to gather as much of it as possible. But beyond that, the PAVN objectives were to protect the installations in the Tri Phap, expand the base area there, and use the infiltration corridors from Cambodia without interference from the ARVN. Success in these ventures would force contractions of the ARVN defenses along Highway 4, demoralize the soldiers of the ARVN 7th Division charged with the responsibility and support the propaganda campaign among ARVN troops. As the year wore on, ARVN units slowly wore down the four main force regiments in PAVN Military Region 2 - the Z-18th, Z-15th, E-24th and DT1. Despite receiving hundreds of fresh replacements from the north, these regiments gradually lost ground to aggressive attacks. The PAVN 207th Regiment, which had suffered so badly in its disastrous H·ªìng Ng·ª± campaign, was required to provide soldiers to replace losses in the E-24th Regiment. These demoralized soldiers were intercepted en route to the Tri Phap area in September; their casualties were heavy and 14 were captured. The PAVN 6th Division was disbanded in late 1973 and its depleted regiments were assigned to PAVN Military Region 2. The South Vietnamese Joint Operations Center provided data on casualties in December 1973 that showed nearly 40 percent of all PAVN killed during the last half of 1973 died in the delta. Although the figures were estimations the ratio was probably very close to reality, supported as it was by weapons captured and corresponding ARVN casualties. The South Vietnamese held the Kien Tuong Province capital of M·ªôc H√≥a and a base at Long Khot (), both of which were well within 105 mm howitzer range of PAVN artillery in Svay Rieng, but there were great reaches of uncontrolled, unoccupied territory between the Cambodian border and the first major population concentration along Highway 4 through M·ªπ Tho. The PAVN 5th Division operated out of Svay Rieng Province in both directions, through T√¢y Ninh Province to An L·ªôc and south toward M·ªπ Tho. In early 1974, the 5th was north of T√¢y Ninh but available for operations into Kien Tuong and H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Provinces. Although South Vietnamese forces were not strong enough to contain the PAVN in Svay Rieng, they could limit the PAVN's freedom of movement, make resupply of troops costly and difficult, and inflict high casualties. To do this much, the ARVN had to hold M·ªôc H√≥a and Long Khot, seize the PAVN's logistical and operational base around Tri Phap and protect Highway 4 between Cai L·∫≠y District and M·ªπ Tho. In January 1974 intelligence became available to IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. Nguy·ªÖn Vƒ©nh Nghi, that elements of the PAVN 5th Division were being ordered to Dinh Tuong Province from T√¢y Ninh. Later in the month, advance elements of the division were detected in the division's Svay Rieng base. Two PAVN soldiers captured on 27 January told their interrogators that a battalion of the division's 6th Regiment had been sent south to reinforce the understrength PAVN Z-18 Regiment in the Tri Phap area, Their testimony, along with that of four recent ralliers and captured documents, also indicated that the Dong Thap 1 Regiment, which traditionally operated in Dinh Tuong, was still badly understrength, though it had recently received 300 PAVN replacements following its December 1973 battles and would also probably receive more replacements from the 6th Regiment, 5th Division. The interrogators also learned that the Z-15 Regiment had just received about 200 replacements from the North but that it was short weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, ARVN outposts, patrols, and air observers detected PAVN transportation elements moving past Tuyen Binh on infiltration Route 1A. Some of these were intercepted, and the ARVN captured large quantities of rice and ammunition, as well as a PAVN transportation company commander. If the 5th Division were allowed to occupy the Tri Phap, it would be extremely difficult to dig out, and the threat to Highway 4 would become intolerable. The previous year's experience had shown General Nghi that his troops were capable of driving into and probably clearing the Tri Phap of the PAVN elements, particularly if he moved fast while the PAVN regiments were still reforming and receiving replacements. If he could establish a base of operations at Tri Phap, he could deny a vital logistical complex to the 5th Division, one that it would require for operations in Dinh Tuong. Battle On 12 February, the ARVN 12th Infantry Regiment, 7th Division, reinforced with two battalions of the 10th Infantry and two troops of armored cavalry in personnel carriers, attacked through Tri Phap from the east and advanced to the Kien Phong-Dien Tuong Province boundary. Three days later, the 14th Infantry Regiment, 9th Division, reinforced with one battalion of the 16th Infantry and two troops of armored cavalry, attacked east from My An District town and linked up with the 12th Infantry on the western edge or the Tri Phap. This two-pronged attack was followed on the 19th by an attack by the 10th Infantry Regiment, minus the two battalions attached to the 12th, from Hau My village in northern C√°i B√® District, north to clear the southern edge of the Tri Phap. Completely enveloped, the PAVN in the Tri Phap suffered heavy losses in men and supplies. Elements of the Z-15 and Z-18 were identified in the battle, but most PAVN casualties were among rear service troops. Another element of the PAVN 5th Division, the 6th Battalion, 174th Infantry, was also identified in the heavy fighting around My An on the western edge or the Tri Phap, indicating that earlier intelligence concerning probable deployment of elements of the 5th from T√¢y Ninh was valid. PAVN casualties were heavy that first week or the Tri Phap campaign; over 500 were killed, and the ARVN captured tons of ammunition and nearly 200 weapons. ARVN casualties were light in comparison. Fighting flared through most of Kien Tuong and Dinh Tuong Provinces for the rest or February and until the last week of March. The center of action remained in the Tri Phap where the PAVN again reinforced, this time with the Dong Thap 1 Regiment which was sent north to join the Z-18. The ARVN kept up the pressure, and in successive weeks killed another 250 PAVN, capturing as many weapons. Meanwhile, COSVN directed PAVN Military Region 3 (the southern delta command) to launch widespread attacks to take the pressure off Kien Tuong and Dinh Tuong. Replacements, up to 3,000 according to two ARVN soldiers who escaped from captivity in Cambodia, were being readied for assignment to units in Svay Rieng Province. Unable to counter ARVN advances on the battlefields, the PAVN resorted to an increased terror campaign throughout the delta. On 9 March they fired an 82 mm mortar shell into the primary schoolyard at Cai L·∫≠y while the children were lined up waiting to enter their classes. Twenty-three children died instantly; 46 others were badly wounded. Farther south, in B·∫°c Lieu, Vietcong tossed a grenade into a religious service killing 9 and wounding 16. ARVN operations on the My An front, on the western edge of the Tri Phap area, were being supported out of Cao L√£nh, with supplies coming up from Giao Duc on interprovincial Route 30. The forces on the eastern edge of the Tri Phap and those fighting north around Moe Hoa were being supported along Interprovincial Route 29 out of Cai L·∫≠y. The ARVN successfully countered PAVN attempts to cut these two routes. The first phase or the Tri Phap campaign slowly wound down during the last part or March. The Dong Thap 1 Regiment picked up 150 replacements, freshly arrived from North Vietnam, and PAVN Military Region 2, whose regiments were being battered in the Tri Phap fighting, received 200 replacements who had been previously destined for Military Region 3. Reinforcing success in the last week or March, General Nghi sent the 7th Ranger Group against the Dong Thap 1 Regiment in the Tri Phap, where the Rangers killed over 30 and captured more weapons. By the end of March, more than 1100 PAVN had been killed in the Tri Phap campaign, while the ARVN had fewer than 100 killed. Nearly 5,000 tons of rice were captured, along with over 600 weapons, 8 tons of ammunition and a large haul of weapon accessories, radios and other military equipment. Three PAVN regiments, the Z-15, Z-18 and Dong Thap 1, had been severely mauled, and the Tri Phap base area was denied to the PAVN 5th Division. Work began immediately on the construction of fortified positions in the Tri Phap, enough to provide for posting an ARVN regiment there. The PAVN Z-15 Regiment meanwhile was recuperating in southwestern Dinh Tuong Province, attacking ARVN outposts and preparing to return to the Tri Phap. On 26 April two PAVN battalions attacked the Regional Force (RF) battalion base at the village of Tri Phap. In a complementary attack farther south on the Kien Phong-Dinh Tuong Province boundary, the Dong Thap 1 Regiment struck another RF outpost. Although temporarily successful, the PAVN soon faced the ARVN's 14th Regiment and a troop of the 2nd Armored Cavalry and was routed with heavy casualties. Meanwhile, the 11th Infantry counterattacked in the Tri Phap and restored the lost position. The ARVN, by the first week in May. was therefore in firm control in the Tri Phap, with four RF battalions holding strong positions there. PAVN forces in the area were weakened and demoralised, but elsewhere in the delta they kept up their campaign of terror and the slow deterioration of local security continued. Although abductions and assassinations were predominant, the PAVN attacked another school. On 4 May, eight rounds of 82 mm mortar shells fell on the school at Song Phu, in Vƒ©nh Long Province, six children were killed and 28 wounded. Aftermath The ARVN had successfully prevented the PAVN 5th Division from establishing a base from which to extend its operations southward into Dinh Tuong Province and westward toward Saigon through Long An Province. Denied this approach, the 5th Division built up their forces on the periphery of the Parrot's Beak, threatening the district headquarters at M·ªôc H√≥a, but, more seriously, preparing to occupy the narrow strip of marshland between the Svay Rieng border and the Yam Co Dong River, the last real barrier between the Cambodian border and Saigon, only 48km away. PAVN success would have strangled T√¢y Ninh Province, since the seizure of Go Dau Ha would end all land and water communications between Saigon and T√¢y Ninh. The ARVN dealt with this threat by launching an armored thrust against PAVN base areas in Svay Rieng starting in late March.

It received positive reviews; while Vijay's performance, concept and cinematography was praised and became a super hit both the screenplay and sequences were criticised. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Roshagadu, and dubbed and released in Malayalam as Ushiran.  Plot  Constable Murugavel (Vijay Antony), who is from a village in Tamil Nadu, lives his life for his brother, who is a school student. He finds that his brother is having a criminal nature following various incidents, which points out his brother as the culprit, and his brother also has friends of similar nature. Murugavel tries various ways to change the mindset of his brother but fails. One fine day, Murugavel's brother runs away from home to live a better life, which he dreams of. Murugavel, at the same time, gets posted as a sub- inspector in Chennai. While in Chennai, Murugavel comes to know that his brother is now a well-known criminal who is involved in snatching as well as other crime cases. He comes to know that his brother and others who do such cases are under 18 years of age and they are controlled by a person named Meesa Padma (Sai Dheena), a local thug and gangster who uses children under 18 years of age for his antisocial activities. Murugavel is identified as a vegetable vendor by his brother, and Murugavel also shows interest to live with his brother. On the other hand, Murugavel's brother tries to kill Murugavel by adding poison to the food bought for him, but Murugavel refuses to eat for three consecutive days. On the place where Murugavel has set his vegetable shop, he meets Madonna (Nivetha Pethuraj) a policewoman who comes to collect bribes from local shopkeepers. At night, Murugavel's brother plans the next operation of snatching at a spot near Murugavel's shop. He is revealed as a police officer to his brother that night and chases his brother through the streets. When caught, he says that he has not attained 18 years of age, so he cannot be made guilty in front of the law. Murugavel somehow manages to make it 12:00 AM, the day when his brother turns 18. He then kills his brother. From there, Murugavel is regarded as a daring police officer and gets promoted as Inspector but fights a condition of getting high blood pressures and insomnia at times. He sets out on a mission to solve problems in the city and decides to take on Meesa Padma by projecting the police as the heroic figure rather than Meesa Padma, who the youngsters see as their heroic figure. In a side story, we witness the blossoming of Madonna and Murugavel. Throughout the story, we see Madonna protecting Murugavel in several ways, while also expressing her love for Murugavel. One fine day, Murugavel gets slit by two young boys working for Meesa Padma. He is then saved and admitted in the hospital by Madonna, who has foreseen a nightmare of Murugavel getting slit. With the people shutting their shops to go see him, the young boys realize their mistake and side with Murugavel during the final climactic fight between Murugavel and Meesa Padma which sees, Murugavel emerging victorious and Meesa Padma fractured in several places by the youngsters. They become \\"Friends of Police\\" on the recommendation of Murugavel. Murugavel then gets promoted to Assistant Commissioner of Police by the Inspector General, the order for which is heard on Madonna's walkie-talkie. Murugavel finally is at peace, when he sees his mother's photo on which the hallucination of his brother comes at peace with him when his brother is seen apologizing for his mistake and revers Murugavel as the real hero and allows him to sleep in peace. We see that Murugavel's blood pressure remains stabilized at normal during his sleep, implying that he has battled his insomnia successfully.

Roshagadu  Controversy  The producers of films including Sei, Kaatrin Mozhi and Utharavu Maharaja deeply criticized and threatened for legal actions against Vijay Antony for his sudden postponement of Thimiru Pudichavan to 16 November instead of releasing it on 6 November which would significantly affect the screening shows for the above mentioned films on the particular date. There has been a problem with the number of screens allotted to the film. There was a total of 150 screens allowed to the film with every step of the process took ahead with proper and legal procedure. But suddenly another film named \\"Thimiru pudichaven\\" which was set to release on Diwali 2018 was postponed to 16 November 2018. As this film was postponed the number of screens for \\"Sei\\" was reduced to 60-70 screens. The team is hoping for a good news so that they can release the film in the right time.

Other names through its history have been the Princess Theatre (before it was first opened), the Prince of Wales Theatre, Tivoli Theatre and the Opera Theatre. It re-opened in June 2020 after a major refurbishment. History Designed by Adelaide-born architects David Williams and Charles Thomas Good, the foundation stone for the Princess Theatre was laid on 14 October 1912. However, after it was built in 1913, it opened as the New Tivoli Theatre, part of national Tivoli vaudeville circuit, and is the only original Tivoli still standing. The opening ceremony was presided over by Mayor John Lavington Bonython on 5 September 1913. It was renamed the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1920, and back to the Tivoli Theatre in 1930. In 1962 it was named Her Majesty's Theatre, staging ballets, opera and plays. After suffering financially from the drop in attendances after the introduction of television in Australia television in 1956, it was saved by the Dunstan government in 1976 when it was purchased by the state government for the State Opera of South Australia, and renamed the Opera Theatre upon its reopening in 1979. Its present name dates from 31 August 1988. In the 1970s and 1980s, the theatre underwent extensive renovations, stripping all of the theatre's internal heritage features and removing the grand circle (the gods), halving the theatre's capacity to 970. The renovations established a central foyer but the layout was small and presented significant challenge for operations and patron experience. =Major redevelopment= Her Majesty's Theatre closed in 2018 to undergo a two-year, $66-million major redevelopment. The heritage facade and eastern wall were preserved, but everything else removed, creating space for a redeveloped larger theatre. The project included expanding into the lot next door, increasing the size of the stage and auditorium, returning grand circle seating, and improving accessibility and facilities front of house and backstage. The redevelopment was designed by Adelaide-based COX Architecture and built by Hansen Yuncken, managed by the South Australian Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure and Adelaide Festival Centre Trust. The new Her Majesty's Theatre opened on 12 June 2020. The theatre was unveiled by Douglas Gautier , Adelaide Festival Centre CEO & Artistic Director. Uncle Mickey Kumatpi Marrutya O'Brien, a senior Kaurna and Narungga man, marked the official completion with a Welcome to Country and smoking ceremony. The redeveloped theatre features a 1467-seat auditorium over three levels. The grand circle was rebuilt, after an absence of 50 years. Two curving staircases in the expanded main foyer and other features retain some of the original Edwardian-era Art Nouveau elements, including a pressed metal ceiling, elegant architraves and mouldings. Other features include custom-built curved timber balcony fronts in the auditorium, foyer bars on all three levels, a larger backstage rehearsal room and a huge glass fa√ßade to the new west wing. The theatre's \\"signature wall\\", formerly in the basement, was deconstructed and reinstalled brick by brick in a central position backstage. The wall is covered with signatures from visiting stars, including Julie Anthony, Rowan Atkinson, Lauren Bacall, Alan Cumming, and Barry Humphries. On the floors of each foyer level, brass tiles are engraved with the names of some of the notable stars who have performed at the theatre over the past 100 years. Accessibility improvements include stair-free access to all levels and backstage areas and accessible seating on all levels. Governance It is managed by a statutory authority, the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, and owned by this entity since it was bought from Arts SA for in July 2017. The Trust borrowed from the South Australian Government Financing Authority for a maximum term of 10 years to fund a major redevelopment.

It is the location of the Al Zorah mixed use luxury development, which comprises housing and leisure developments, including the Al Zorah Golf Club, the Oberoi Beach Resort Al Zorah, and the Lux Al Zorah (slated to open 2021). It is also the site of Al Zorah Nature reserve, which is home to some 60 species of bird including pink flamingo, egret and heron.  History  Originally an uninhabited sandy island surrounded by mangrove swamps, Al Zorah was disputed when, in 1866, Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi of Sharjah, supported by Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi II of Ajman and with the financial assistance of the Wahhabi agent, Turki bin Ahmed Al Sudairi, erected a fort there. As the development 'threatened the peace of the coast' according to the British, it was bombarded by the British ship HMS Highflyer. In 1895, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan saw in Al Zorah an ideal base for supplying Bani Qitab forces loyal to him in conflicts with the Northern Sheikhs and applied to the British Resident for permission to move supplies there by sea. Unaware of the true reasons for the movement, the Resident gave permission but Zayed faced opposition in his scheme from other Sheikhs and was unable to complete the movement. In 1897, a section of the Sudan (singular Al Suwaidi) tribe under Sultan bin Nasser Al Suwaidi requested permission to settle Al Zorah with the support of Zayed (himself a Suwaidi on his mother's side and married to one of Sultan's daughters) and this was granted by the Resident. Alarmed by the scheme, the Ruler of Ajman built a fort at one of the waterways connecting Al Zorah with the mainland (it was at the time an island) and the Ruler of Sharjah, in 1890, appealed to the Resident to prevent this establishment of a non-Al Qasimi stronghold in the midst of his territory. This being upheld, to the annoyance of Zayed who had seen Al Zorah as an extension of his claim to the Northern coast, the scheme was abandoned and the decision to block it was subsequently upheld after a visit to Al Zorah by Major Percy Cox, the British Political Resident. Following the Dubai Incident in 1910, Cox considered Al Zorah as the site for a wireless telegraphy station, but his plans were never approved.  Development  The Al Zorah planned development project has been implemented by the Al Zorah Development Company P.S.C, a partnership between the Government of Ajman and Lebanese developer Solidere International. Under Ajman law, Al Zorah is a designated free zone, which allows for 100% foreign ownership of property and businesses and confers tax free status. The 5.4 million square metre development (of which 1 million square metres are mangroves, forming the Al Zorah Nature Reserve) includes five distinct housing districts: the Shores, the Fairways, the Coves, the Gates and the Avenues. Overall, 60% of the project's land area is given over to mangroves and public spaces. The Avenues comprises 2km of retail and leisure developments. The development includes a watersports centre and tours by both boat and seaplane. The Marina-1 development offers berths for yachts between eight and 40 metres alongside 15 restaurants and caf√©s. The 18-hole championship golf course at Al Zorah was designed by Jack Nicklaus and is managed by Troon Golf.

Prior to that, he served as the manager of United's under-18s, he also served in the same position for Tottenham Hotspur. McKenna joined Tottenham as a youth player in 2002, having signed a scholarship contract on a transfer from Ballinamallard United. In 2009, at the age of 23, McKenna was forced to retire from playing as a result of a hip injury; he had failed to make a full senior team appearance for Tottenham. He also represented the Northern Ireland national team at under-19 and under-21 level.

If you played against West Brom, you trained how they are and focused on their weaknesses.\\" Jim Magilton, the Irish Football Association's elite performance director, agreed with Boonen's appraisal of McKenna, commenting, \\"He is a meticulous planner yet every session is spontaneous. Nothing is set in stone. He adjusts the session to how the players are and gets what he wants out of the session. Everything is linked and game related. Nothing is for show ‚Äì it has to be about the game.\\" After claims that McKenna's coaching methods \\"lacked continental expertise\\", Manchester United supporters backed the coach, with them believing that McKenna is one of the greatest young coaches in England. It was claimed that players were not convinced about McKenna's coaching, though manager Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r and fellow assistant coach Michael Carrick trust him. United insiders, employed by The Times, stated, \\"McKenna [is] to be one of the best young coaches in England ‚Äì and [is] one who will only get better. He helps on the pre-match preparations, [he is] determined to get United the best possible chance of tactically outclassing their opposition. And McKenna reportedly spends every plane or coach journey going over footage of matches, pouring over data and relaying it to his superiors.\\" Personal life Since his childhood, McKenna has been a supporter of Manchester United, with reporters claiming that his love for the club had persuaded his decision to leave Tottenham Hotspur for the Red Devils in 2016.

It was released on October 2, 2018 by Dutton Books for Young Readers. This is the fourth book in the series and the first installment of a new trilogy set in the United States; it features the main protagonists from the original trilogy as well as introducing several new key characters. Plot Jacob Portman is shocked at his friends' presence in modern day. With Miss Peregrine's support, he tells his parents everything. His father recounts a peculiar-related memory and says he wants to forget everything. He scolds Jacob for siding with Abe. Miss Peregrine wipes their memories. Jacob wants to leave his normal life behind, but she says he is meant for both worlds. The children find Abe's shelter and log. Miss Peregrine takes them to the Devil's Acre. Sharon is now in charge of the Panloopticon, and the house has been turned into a terminal and shelter for peculiars. At the temporary headquarters of the Council of Ymbrynes, Miss Cuckoo and Miss Peregrine ask Jacob to speak about the battle with Caul to boost morale. After receiving a matchbook from Lester Noble Jr., Jacob calls the number and says he wants to continue Abe's work. He and Emma follow H's instructions to a diner and are sent into a loop, where a hollow attacks. Before they could kill it, H calls off the hollowgast Horatio and says Jacob is hired. H says he and Abe's group hunted hollows and rescued peculiar children. H gives them packages to bring to Florida and New York. Jacob and Emma find a hidden passageway to Abe's cars and, along with Millard, Brownyn, and Enoch, drive to Mermaid Fantasyland in Florida. They meet Paul, who leads them into a loop to escape police. At the Flamingo Manor, they give Billie a package and learn that wights killed most of the ymbrynes in America, leaving mostly demi-ymbrynes. They fight off the gang \\"police\\" from earlier, and Paul agrees to take them to a portal in his hometown, Georgia. On the way, Paul, who is black, refuses to enter a diner. Jacob realizes they are in the Deep South in the time of segregation. They enter the loop in 1935 and meet Elmer and Joseph, who describe someone named Gandy and show Jacob a photo of a younger H and V, H's travel companion. Jacob discovers Gandy is Abe. Jacob gives Annie the other package. She tells them about the Organization, a group of normals who want to eradicate peculiars from the country, and gives him a matchbook bearing a North Carolina address. At the North Carolina restaurant, they receive instructions to bring a peculiar from a Brooklyn high school to loop 10044. Jacob and Emma agree to put their relationship on hold. The others call to say Miss Peregrine is looking for them. In New York City, they stay at a hotel where Abe had also stayed, a loop. At J. Edgar Hoover High School, they meet Lilly, a friend of Noor, the peculiar. Lilly takes them to an abandoned warehouse. Jacob ignores H's order to abort the mission. They meet Noor, who absorbs and releases light to blind the armed men who attack them. The children escape. Brownwyn, who had been shot with a dart, passes out. En route to the hospital, they are lured into a restaurant and, except for Lilly, taken into a loop. They meet Frankie, who calls together the clan leaders of New York for an auction. The group is brought by 1920s gangsters to Leo Burnham, who reprimands the leaders for attending an illegal auction. Leo wants to execute Jacob because Abe killed Leo's granddaughter, Agatha, along with other children. Jacob believes wights framed Abe. Leo's sister Donna, the Baroness, convinces him to pardon them. Leo detains Noor, but Jacob is released and met by his friends, Miss Peregrine, and Miss Cuckoo. They go through a loop to the Acre. Miss Peregrine says the ymbrynes were working on a peace treaty with the Clans, and the group's actions have set them back. Jacob calls H, who says Abe wanted Jacob to have a normal life. H says he has one last job before he retires, which Jacob senses has to do with Noor. Sharon invites Jacob to a meeting. Jacob accepts a ticket but says he is not going against the ymbrynes. Jacob finds H's apartment and a dying H, with Noor unconscious nearby. H tells him to take Noor and seek V, as Noor and six other peculiars are the seven prophesied peculiars. H says although he and Abe did not kill any children themselves, they are responsible for their deaths. H lets Horatio eat his eyes as he dies. Horatio turns into a wight and leaves them directions before jumping out the window. Jacob and Noor set out to find V.

The relations are useful for interpretation of luminescence based measurements of solar cells and modules and for the analysis of recombination losses in solar cells.  Basics  Solar cells and light-emitting diodes are both semiconducting diodes that are operated in a different voltage and illumination regime and that serve different purposes. A solar cell is operated under illumination (usually by solar radiation) and is typically kept at the maximum power point where the product of current and voltage are maximized. A light emitting diode is operated at an applied forward bias (without external illumination). While a solar cell converts the energy contained in the electromagnetic waves of the incoming solar radiation into electric power (voltage x current) a light-emitting diode does the inverse, namely converting electrical power into electromagnetic radiation. A solar cell and a light emitting diode are typically made from different materials and optimized for different purposes; however, conceptually every solar cell could be operated as a light emitting diode and vice versa. Given that the operation principles have a high symmetry it is fair to assume that the key figures of merit that are used to characterize photovoltaic and luminescent operation of diodes are related to each other. These relations become particularly simple in a situation, where recombination rates scale linearly with minority carrier density and are explained below.  Reciprocity between the photovoltaic quantum efficiency and the electroluminescence spectrum of a pn-junction diode  Illustration of the basic underlying principles of the reciprocity relation between photovoltaic quantum efficiency and external luminescence quantum efficiency of a light emitting diode. On the left, the band diagram of a p-n junction solar cell is depicted with a thin n-type region on the left and a thicker p-type region on the right. Light absorption in the p-type base leads to free electrons that have to be collected by diffusing to the edge of the space charge region between the n and p-type regions of the diode. On the right, a forward voltage is applied to the same diode. Electron injection will lead to recombination and consequently light emission. The emission spectrum of the luminescence emitted in the situation on the right is directly related to the quantum efficiency of photocurrent in the photovoltaic situation on the left. The relation between the two situations is based on the principle of detailed balance that relates absorption and radiative recombination via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation and charge collection and injection via the Donolato theorem. The photovoltaic quantum efficiency Q_{e,PV} is a spectral quantity that is generally measured as a function of photon energy (or wavelength). The same is true for the electroluminescence spectrum \\\\phi_{EL} of a light emitting diode under applied forward voltage V. Under certain conditions specified below, these two properties measured on the same diode are connected via the equation :\\\\phi_{EL}=Q_{e,PV}\\\\phi_{bb}[\\\\exp{\\\\frac{qV}{kT}}-1] (1) where \\\\phi_{bb} is the black body spectrum emitted by a surface (the diode) into the hemisphere above the diode in units of photons per area, time and electron interval. In this case the black body spectrum is given by :\\\\phi_{bb}=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{h^3c^2}\\\\frac{E^2}{\\\\exp{E/kT}-1} where k is the Boltzmann constant, h is Planck‚Äôs constant, c is the speed of light in vacuum, and T is the temperature of the diode. This simple relation is useful for the analysis of solar cells using luminescence-based characterization methods. Luminescence used for characterization of solar cells is useful because of the ability to image the luminescence of solar cells and modules in short periods of times, while spatially resolved measurements of photovoltaic properties (such as photocurrent or photovoltage) would be very time-consuming and technically difficult. Equation (1) is valid for the practically relevant situation, where the neutral base region of a pn-junction makes up most of the volume of the diode. Typically, the thickness of a crystalline Si solar cell is ~ 200 ¬µm while the thickness of the emitter and space charge region is only on the order of hundreds of nanometers, i.e. three orders of magnitude thinner. In the base of a pn-junction, recombination is typically linear with minority carrier concentration over a large range of injection conditions and charge carrier transport is by diffusion. In this situation, the Donolato theorem . is valid that states that the collection efficiency f_c is related to the normalized minority carrier concentration \\\\delta n(x)/\\\\delta n(x=x_j) via :f_c(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\delta n(x)}{\\\\delta n(x=x_j)} where x is a spatial coordinate and x_j defines the position of the edge of the space charge region (where the neutral zone and the space charge region connect). Thus, if x=x_j, the collection efficiency is one. Further away from the edge of the space charge region, the collection efficiency will be smaller than one depending on the distance and the amount of recombination happening in the neutral zone. The same holds for the electron concentration in the dark under applied bias. Here, the electron concentration will also decrease from the edge of the space charge region towards the back contact. This decrease as well as the collection efficiency will be approximately exponential (with the diffusion length controlling the decay). The Donolato theorem is based on the principle of detailed balance and connects the processes of charge carrier injection (relevant in the luminescent mode of operation) and charge carrier extraction (relevant in the photovoltaic mode of operation). In addition, the detailed balance between absorption of photons and radiative recombination can be mathematically expressed using the van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation as :k_{rad}n_i^2=\\\\int\\\\alpha4n_r^2\\\\phi_{bb}dE Here, \\\\alpha is the absorption coefficient, k_{rad} is the radiative recombination coefficient, n_r is the refractive index, n_i is the intrinsic charge carrier concentration. A derivation of equation (1) can be found in ref. The reciprocity relation (eq. (1)) is only valid if absorption and emission is dominated by the neutral region of the pn-junction shown in the adjacent figure. This is a good approximation for crystalline silicon solar cells and the method can also be used for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 based solar cells. However the equations has limitations when applied to solar cells where the space charge region is of comparable size to the total absorber volume. This is the case for instance for organic solar cells or amorphous Si solar cells. The reciprocity relation is also invalid if the emission of the solar cell is not from delocalized conduction and valence band states as would be the case for most mono and polycrystalline semiconductors but from localized states (defect states). This limitation is relevant for microcrystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells.  Reciprocity between the open-circuit voltage of a solar cell and the external luminescence quantum efficiency  The open-circuit voltage V_{oc} of a solar cell is the voltage created by a certain amount of illumination if the contacts of the solar cell are not connected, i.e. in open circuit. The voltage that can build up in such as situation is directly connected to the density of electrons and holes in the device. These densities in turn depend on the rates of photogeneration (determined by the amount of illumination) and the rates of recombination. The rate of photogeneration is usually determined by the typically used illumination with white light with a power density of 100mW/cm2 (called one sun) and by the band gap of the solar cell and does not change much between different devices of the same type. The rate of recombination however might vary over orders of magnitude depending on the quality of the material and the interfaces. Thus, the open-circuit voltage depends quite drastically on the rates of recombination at a given concentration of charge carriers. The highest possible open-circuit voltage, the radiative open-circuit voltage V_{oc,rad}, is obtained if all recombination is radiative and non-radiative recombination is negligible. This is the ideal situation, because radiative recombination cannot be avoided other than by avoiding light absorption (principle of detailed balance). However, since absorption is a key requirement for a solar cell and necessary to achieve a high concentration of electrons and holes as well, radiative recombination is a necessity (see van Roosbroeck-Shockley equation ). If non- radiative recombination is substantial and non negligible, the open-circuit voltage will be reduced depending on the ratio between the radiative and non- radiative recombination currents (where the recombination currents are the integral of the recombination rates over volume). This leads to a second reciprocity relation between the photovoltaic and the luminescent operation mode of a solar cell because the ratio of radiative to total (radiative and non-radiative) recombination currents is the external luminescence quantum efficiency Q_{e,lum} of a (light emitting) diode. Mathematically, this relation is expressed as , :qV_{oc,rad}-qV_{oc}=-kT\\\\ln{Q_{e,lum}} (2) Thus, any reduction in the external luminescence quantum efficiency by one order of magnitude would lead to a reduction in open-circuit voltage (relative to V_{oc,rad}) by kT/q\\\\times \\\\ln(10)\\\\approx 60 mV. Equation (2) is frequently used in the literature on solar cells. For instance for an improved understanding of the open-circuit voltage in organic solar cells and for comparing voltage losses between different photovoltaic technologies.

It is a larger species of damselfish which is found in the Indo-Pacific where it occurs around branching corals in sheltered areas of reefs. Description The lagoon damselfish is a large brown species of damselfish, often the adults' have a pale russet head and the colour of the fish gradually darkens towards the tail. There are pinkish markings on the operculum. The juveniles are dark blue to brownish on the head and near body and are yellow towards the tail and on the underside with a large iridescent blue eyespot on the dorsal fin, and blue bands and spots near the head on its body. They grow to a maximum length of . Sometimes the only distinctive marking is a yellow eyering. Distribution The lagoon damselfish is found in the eastern Indian Ocean from Thailand through Indonesia, the Philippines and the Timor Sea into the western Pacific where it is found south to Australia and north to China and eadt to the Solomon Islands. Habitat and biology The lagoon damselfish is found in sheltered reefs and lagoons, often in areas of high turbidity and a silty substrate at the base of branching corals. They are found at depths of . They are detritovores and the species has up to three times the number of gill rakers than other damselfish which are for feeding on fine detritus. They are territorial and defend a patch of algal covered reef. While feeding on detritus they will consume small amounts of algae and invertebrates. They form pairs for breeding, clearing an area to create a nest, then they begin in a mating dance which involves fast swimming and movements of the fins. While mating the males frequently darken and may develop white blotches. The eggs are laid at dawn, the eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate where the male guards and aerates them. Conservation The lagoon damselfish has not been evaluated for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but it may be threatened by habitat degradation and by human exploitation.

During the uprising, many Jews fled to Bansk√° Bystrica, a partisan stronghold; when the town fell, Jews, actual or suspected Slovak partisans, and Romani people captured during roundups were temporarily held in the town's jail. The victims were then trucked to the murder sites at Kremniƒçka and Nemeck√°, where they were shot. The majority of the 747 people shot at Kremniƒçka were Jewish. Exact figures are not known for the Nemeck√° massacres, because the bodies were burned, but historians estimate a death toll of around 900, of whom most of the known victims were Jewish or Romani. Background In response to increased activity of Slovak partisans who opposed Nazi Germany and the Axis- aligned Slovak government, Germany invaded Slovakia, precipitating the Slovak National Uprising, which broke out on 29 August 1944. Fearing a resumption of deportations to extermination camps, many Jews fled to Bansk√° Bystrica, the center of the uprising, and other partisan-controlled areas in central Slovakia. The Germans and local collaborators‚ÄîHlinka Guard Emergency Divisions (POHG)‚Äîsoon defeated the partisans and Slovak Army units which supported the uprising. When Bansk√° Bystrica, the last opposition stronghold, fell on 27 October, Jews and Romani people as well as actual and suspected partisans were rounded up and held temporarily in an overcrowded prison with minimal food and water. Overall, about 4,000 people were murdered in Slovakia, mostly by Einsatzgruppe H, but with help from local collaborators. Massacres at Kremniƒçka Exhumed victims of the Kremniƒçka massacre Victims were placed in trucks and driven to Kremniƒçka, where the partisans had dug anti-tank trenches. They were told to leave the trucks and were marched across a field to the trenches, where they were told to lie down. According to witnesses, the victims did not offer resistance. Both German and Slovak soldiers went through the rows of victims and shot them one by one. Other soldiers stood guard around the perimeter to make sure that no one escaped. After some had been killed, others jumped into the trenches among the dead, however the soldiers went through and shot them. Evidence collected upon exhumation determined that some were suffocated to death. There were massacres on 5 November, 20 November (282 victims), 12 and 19 December, 5 and 20 January, and 19 February. Of the 747 victims, 211 were women and 58 were children; half were Jewish. Two of the victims, Haviva Reik and , were Jewish Parachutists of Mandate Palestine. Another well-known victim was the Slovak Jewish intellectual . According to Slovak historian Anton Hrubo≈à, about 5% of all members of the Emergency Divisions actually participated in massacres. However, Slovak collaborators who had been present at Kremniƒçka frequently lied about their involvement in order to avoid prosecution, for example claiming that they had been threatened and coerced into participating in the massacre by German SD members and only shot over victims' heads. Other Slovak collaborators bragged about their murders, despite strict orders to keep the crimes confidential. Therefore, it is impossible to know the exact role that individual soldiers played in the massacre, but even those who did not shoot still contributed to the killings by guarding the perimeter and performing other auxiliary tasks. Massacres at Nemeck√° Memorial to the victims of the Slovak National Uprising in Nemeck√° The nearby village of Nemeck√° was chosen as an execution site due to its limestone kilns, which were used to cremate the corpses. Victims were taken from the prison in Bansk√° Bystrica in trucks and shot, before being burned. Because the bodies were burned, the exact number of victims is unknown but according to Israeli historian Gila Fatran, about 900 people were murdered. Einsatskommando 14's records indicate that 205 victims were \\"racially undesirable\\", 26 people were suspected of participating in the uprising, and a few of the victims were American, French, Soviet, and Romanian servicemen. The killings at Nemeck√° took place between 4 and 11 January 1945; both the Hlinka Guardsmen and Einsatzkommando 14 participated in the killings. Commemoration The event has been described as the Slovak Katyn. Some Slovak commentators have focused on the fact that Slovak collaborators killed non-Jewish Slovak citizens. According to Fatran, the murders at Kremniƒçka came to symbolize the brutality of the suppression of the uprising. Kremniƒçka and Nemeck√° were the largest war crimes committed on Slovak soil during World War II. The is located in Nemeck√°.

Founded in 1903, it was located about 4 km north of the town center in the municipal forest and closed down in 1933. The sanatorium was opened by the \\"Verein zur Errichtung von Lungenheilst√§tten in Ostpreu√üen e.V.\\" on 1 October 1903. Initially holding a capacity of 50 beds it was soon expanded to 84 beds in 6 single- and 17 multi-bedrooms including one 10-bed hall in a three-story main building. About 2/3 of the property size of 5 Hectar was forested. The surrounding municipal forest of about 450 ha and a small lake was also accessible. As of 1912 it was operated by the chief physician, Dr. Walther Li√©vin, an assistant doctor, four nurses and several technical employees. Between 1903 and 1 April 1912 2,282 patients were treated in Hohenstein. Most of the patients were 16 to 30 year old factory- or agricultural labourers from K√∂nigsberg, they rarely recovered completely and mostly remained unfit for work. With the outbreak of World War I all but five severe cases were released on 1. August 1914, the sanatorium re-opened in April 1915, now treating 100 tuberculous soldiers of the Imperial German Army. On account of the war the provisions were tenuous and the number of patients was reduced. In November 1919 69 patients left the sanatorium because of the catastrophic food supplies and the lack of heating. On 18 December 1919 the K√∂nigsberg Hartungsche Zeitung reported that fluid medicine was frozen inside the patient's rooms. Due to the bad reputation only about 50 percent of the capacity was occupied in 1920. On 15 January 1921 the Hartungsche Zeitung reported the \\"escape\\" of 35 patients who complained about the lack of food and the general \\"military\\" atmosphere under head physician Dr. Li√©vin. Li√©vin, father of actor Albert Lieven, was dismissed on 1 July 1921. Because of the Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic the sanatorium was temporarily closed in July 1923. The economic situation remained difficult and the hospital was finally closed in 1933.

As it heads northwards as Nasrec Road, it bypasses the industrial suburb of Aeroton (where it meets a road providing access to the M1 North Highway to Johannesburg CBD) before passing the Nasrec showground. It passes the FNB Stadium (famously known as Soccer City) to the west and the Crown Mines Golf Club to the east. Continuing northwards it passes under the Soweto Highway (M70), passing through old gold mining tailings, before reaching a roundabout with a road that's meant to be an extension of the N17 south of Riverlea. The road continues northwards as the Nasrec Road through the suburb of Riverlea and passes the George Harrison Park, commemorating the place of the first gold discovery on the Witwatersrand in 1886. Passing under Main Reef Road (R41), the M5 becomes Marais Street and Du Toit Avenue in Paarlshoop. Ending briefly at the intersection of Albertina Sisulu Road in Langlaagte North, it cosigns with the R24 Albertina Sisulu Road eastwards and turns north again at St Jerome Avenue, becoming Mercury Street (separating Langlaagte North from Mayfair West).

History Dempster was the elder son of Rev.

John Dempster was born at Montacute, South Australia and educated at St. Peter's College. He began his musical career as a chorister at St. Peter's Cathedral at the age of eight. He won a choir scholarship at the college, and also received piano and organ lessons from W. M. \\"Billy\\" Hole, the college chapel's organist and choirmaster who died 25 April 1935. He further studied organ playing under Arthur H. Otto at St Peter's Cathedral. He was organist and choirmaster of St Matthews Church, Kensington, then in October 1909 succeeded A. H. Otto at St John's Church, Adelaide, and served there to 1924. Dempster succeeded W. R. Knox as City Organist in 1928. This appointment was attended by controversy, as Dempster was appointed without any competitive evaluation, and eminent musicians John Horner, Frederic Finlay and W. Lawrence Haggitt, who had all applied, signed a public letter airing their sense of injustice, and implying he was a poor choice. The fact that Dempster would receive a salary where previously it was an honorary position, made the choice additionally problematic. He conducted the Adelaide Women's Choir from its foundation in 1934 to November 1936 or perhaps later. He was in March 1937 foundation conductor of the Adelaide Philharmonic Choir, supported by the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio station 5CL and gave its first public concert in October 1937. and remained actively connected until shortly before his death, when it was taken over by Norman Chinner. He wrote many articles on the Adelaide music scene for the newspapers, and for the last seven years of his life was music critic for The Sunday Mail. He was appointed choirmaster and organist at Flinders Street Baptist Church in May 1938, where he served until early in 1942, when forced by ill health to retire. He died three months later, and his remains were interred at the North Road Cemetery. Family (Reginald Robert) John Dempster married Hilda Lane (c. 1885 ‚Äì 13 February 1948) on 7 July 1914.

She developed a school model for literacy of rural women. In 1945, she married Austrian physician Richard Frey, an antifascist fighter in Yan'an. In the period of the civil war and after the founding of the People's Republic of China she worked as a judge, later as a process leader and as a commissioner in the People's Procuratorate. In 1958 she and her husband had to give up their posts for political reasons. She then worked as a principal in a high school and became a critic of the political movements Anti-Rightist Campaign and Great Leap Forward. In 1959, under political pressure, she finally had to annul her marriage and raise her three children on her own. After overcoming a severe depression, she worked until her retirement in 1982 as a party secretary in the clothing industry. She died 2007 in Vienna. Early life Li Binzhu was born in Yanshi County, Henan, China. Her father practiced traditional Chinese medicine in the countryside. During her time at the county middle school, her political stand was actively influenced by her Chinese language teacher and communist Wu Zhipu. 1936 she joined the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard Organization. In 1937, after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, she left the Pedagogical Art School in Henan Province and returned to Yanshi to participate in the War of Resistance against Japan. To appeal to the Liberation Movement, Li Binzhu organized the Reading-/ Women's Group and the National Liberation Theater in Yanshi. She joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in February 1938. In July of the same year, she took leave of her home, went to Yan'an and devoted herself wholeheartedly to the cause of the war against Japanese aggression. Second Sino-Japanese War By the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li Binzhu lived in Yan'an for eight years. She studied Jurisprudence at the university there, worked in the security bureau of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, and later in the education department of the Guanzhong Zone Commission. In 1943, Li Binzhu was assigned by the CCP to conduct the so-called \\"winter learning campaign\\" through literacy, poverty reduction and backwardness in the Londong area, one of the CCP's resistance centers. Initially, she taught the farmers to read in her winter school, teaching them socially, politically, and scientifically learnings. Quickly Li Binzhu realized that due to poverty and lack of education, the old customs still continued to exist, such as: The Child marriage, the Foot binding, superstition of the witch doctor, ignorance of the social life and women's suffrage. In the region there was still a very high number of gynecological diseases and a high infant mortality. In this village, 43 out of 54 women suffered from gynecological diseases, and among 194 newborns, 106 were reported to have died. According to the local conditions she analyzed, Li Binzhu worked on a new implementation strategy. She changed the winter school curriculum and focused on hygiene instruction and obstetrics as the main teaching content. Chinese characters and other knowledge were taught to female participants as well. This was so well received by the population that the number of participants tripled within a week. Many women now enthusiastically attended classes. Because the school achieved very positive results and was very polarizing, the school model was quickly promoted and implemented throughout the region. Li Binzhu's work was highly prized by the CCP Central Committee. Xu Teli, Mao Zedong's teacher, president of the Yan'an Academy of Natural Sciences, said of her winter school: \\"This school taught people the practical knowledge of life. Once the problem of the Obstructed labour (severe birth, risk birth) of women is resolved, the old thinking in the past history is corrected, that Manuscript culture (education) of women is useless.\\" Lin Boqu, President of the Border Region, gave her an honorary title. Li Binzhu's winter school model has been described in \\"Chinese Educational History\\" and \\"Modern Chinese History.\\" Chinese Civil War On 15 July 1945 Li Binzhu married Dr. Richard Frey, who was a researcher and lecturer at the China Medical University (PRC) in Yan'an at the time. After defeating the War of Resistance, Richard Frey and Li Binzhu, who was pregnant at the time, marched with the army into the Zhangjiakou City Liberation Zone. In 1946, Li Binzhu worked as a judge at the People's Court of Zhangjiakou City, while caring for her child born in the war and assisting her husband in producing penicillin, which he had already started in Yan'an. After the outbreak of the civil war, the city of Zhangjiakou fell into the hands of Kuomintang Party. In September 1946, she moved to the CCP base of Jin-Cha-Ji Tang County. After that, Li Binzhu worked as a party secretary of the student organization at the Medical University of North China, and also participated in the local land reform in Tang County. People's Republic of China After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, in March 1950, Li Binzhu was transferred from the China University of Political Science and Law to the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, and was soon transferred back to Chongqing City, which was being conquered by the Communists. She was responsible for the preparation of the establishment of a southwest branch of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government and hold the process manager after the establishment. In 1954 she worked as a commissioner in the southwestern branch of China's Supreme People's Procuratorate in Chongqing. Due to the extreme left-wing course within the party against foreign-born officials, the couple Li Binzhu and Richard Frey were forced to resign from government posts in 1958. Li Binzhu left the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and was assigned a new job as the principal of Chongqing High School No. 29. While assuming the role of school principal, the political movement \\"Anti-Rightist Campaign\\" also spread in her school. Following her knowledge of human nature, she assigned people like the former headmaster, party secretary and teachers, who were considered problematic in the movement due to their different ways of thinking and thus lost their work, to do the corresponding work. The subsequent movement \\"Great Leap Forward\\" also affected High School No. 29. A campaign to increase steel production in the country was carried out at the school. Teachers and students built simple \\"backyard blast furnaces\\" made of bricks in the schoolyard. Each brought home metal ware to school, threw it into the blast furnaces with no expertise, where the unusable scrap was melted down to extract \\"steel.\\" Li Binzhu criticized the absurd action and questioned both unscientific and uneconomic steel production. For her behavior in the two political movements Li Binzhu paid a high price. She was severely cautioned by the party and, after just one year as a high school director, transferred to work in a municipal people's commune. The consequences of the \\"Great Leap Forward\\" were one of the main causes of the ensuing century catastrophe, the Great Chinese Famine in China. One of the particularly affected provinces was Henan. Around three million people were starving to death there, including Li Binzhu's parents. She had left her home and her parents at the age of 16 and was suffering from the fact that she could not afford to pay them their last respect because of her own difficult life. After repeated political misfortunes and the death of her parents, Li Binzhu experienced her own family disaster in 1959 under the high pressure of the political \\"left\\" route. Due to his foreign origin as a foreigner, her husband was under general suspicion as a spy. The party called on Li Binzhu to demarcate herself politically. To protect their three underaged children, they decided to temporarily cancel their marriage. These successive blows caused Li Binzhu a lifelong severe depression. She was therefore later treated in a special hospital for a long time. In 1962, Zhou Enlai transferred Richard Frey, who had since remarried to Chongqing, to the \\"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences\\" in Beijing. Li Binzhu remained in Chongqing and worked again, thanks to her indomitable will after years of treatment for her depression as party secretary in Chongqing's urban garment industry. She raised her three children alone. During the Cultural Revolution, she once again suffered under the espionage charge of her divorced husband, but was able to survive this political movement through her human-oriented leadership style. In 1982, she retired as head of the Discipline Inspection Derivation for the Chengdu City Light Industry Bureau. Later years In the early 1990s, Li Binzhu, who had never remarried and lived alone, visited her children in Vienna, the hometown of Richard Frey. In 1994, she suffered a severe stroke there, which resulted in paralysis. She spent her remaining life in the \\"hospital Hietzing\\" and in the \\"Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Spital\\". During her treatment and stay in the hospital she always received the attention and help of the government of both countries. For her birthday, the mayor of Vienna wrote her a letter of sympathy. In 2005, on the occasion of the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance, the Chinese ambassador of Austria visited her in the hospital. She received the resistance war gold medal. Li Binzhu died on 12 July 2007 in Vienna. The mourning statement of the Chinese Embassy in Vienna was as follows: \\"Comrade Li Bin Zhu was a war veteran who made important contributions to the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. She experienced the high and low, success and tribulation both in time of war, as in peacetime and in difficult time of the country. We will never forget her loyalty, selflessness and fighting spirit, the Chinese people will always remember her. \\" On June 23, 2007, Li Binzhu's ashes were buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery, and on that day, on the other half of the earth in China, in Tang County, the ashes of Richard Frey at the \\"Jin Cha Ji Martyrs Cemetery\\", on the former war front, was also buried. Li Binzhu and Richard Frey, a Eurasian couple, comrades in the Resistance War, were randomly and miraculously buried in the country of their partner's home that same day, and from then on, they found their eternal rest in each other's homeland.

Background The victim was the eleven-year old daughter of Mexican immigrants, living in Cleveland, Texas, a \\"timber town\\" of about nine thousand people in the Greater Houston metropolitan area and Liberty County. Her father was a former construction worker, unemployed at the time for a year and a half because of a back injury, while her mother was working making change in a slot game room. The group of perpetrators included students at the local high school, two of whom were members of the basketball team and one the son of a school-board member, and people with criminal records, from selling drugs to robbery and, in one case, manslaughter. They ranged from middle schoolers to one 27-year-old, at the time of the crime. Discovery On the Monday after Thanksgiving day, on 29 November 2010, a cell phone video clip with images of the sexual encounter between a group of males and a young female circulated in the cafeteria of Cleveland's high school. Some viewers recognized the girl as a 6th grader from the middle school next door. A friend of the girl told a teacher what he had seen in the cell-phone video, as a school-district spokeswoman subsequently stated, and the police were alerted. Investigation Police investigators identified and contacted the girl, whereupon she said that, over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday break, she was raped by a group of young men first at a house and then in a mobile home. According to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the media, police determined the video clip was recorded inside an abandoned mobile home on the city's northern outskirts, next to a Baptist church. According to the subsequent, criminal indictments, the girl was assaulted on four occasions: the first in September, followed by three more during the fall of 2010. In January 2011, she was removed by social workers from her parents' home and taken to foster care. The investigation stirred racial tensions on account of the defendants all being African-Americans and the girl Hispanic, in both the town and nationwide. The case was covered nationwide in the US and also abroad. On Monday 4 April 2011, nineteen defendants appeared in the court of Liberty County district judge Mark Morefield for their arraignment hearing, with six of them pleading \\"not guilty.\\" Support for the accused The New York Times first report focused on the impact of the crime on the Cleveland community.On the 8 March NYT article, a hospital worker, who said she knew several of the defendants, was quoted: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just destroyed our community. These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.‚Äù Also quoted was the spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs devastating, and it‚Äôs really tearing our community apart. I really wish that this could end in a better light.‚Äù There were also quotes from local people who questioned the attitude of the victim's family, such as a neighbor of her parents: \\"Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?‚Äù The report came under criticism for its alleged \\"sympathy\\" for the accused, to the point where the newspaper sent another reporter back at the place and published a self-critical article.The 11 March NYT article stated: \\"The outrage [against the previous NYT report] is understandable. The story dealt with a hideous crime but addressed concerns about the ruined lives of the perpetrators without acknowledging the obvious: concern for the victim. While the story appeared to focus on the community‚Äôs reaction to the crime, it was not enough to simply report that the community is principally concerned about the boys and men involved ‚Äì as this story seems to do. If indeed that is the only sentiment to be found in this community...it becomes important to report... as well [of] voices of professional authorities or dissenting community members who will at least address, and not ignore, the plight of the young girl involved.\\" Quanell X, community leader and head of the New Black Panthers, was an \\"outspoken critic\\" of the victim. In a press conference in front of a Cleveland church, he asked rhetorically where the girl's parents were when this happened and why was \\"that child experiencing so much sex with so many African-American men.\\" He also disputed the rape claims since, as he put it, the girl never actually yelled the word \\"rape\\" during the assault and did not make an \\"outcry\\" until after footage of the assault surfaced.According to the Houston Press 2014 report, Quanell X claimed the investigation into the rape was being \\"run by the KKK\\" and stated to the African American community of the town: \\"We do not want someone with a malicious, racist motive to rid your community of an entire generation of black men.\\" The media reported that the audience \\"cheered and hollered in agreement.\\" Florida representative Kathleen Passidomo proposed that the state should step in and regulate the wardrobe of young girls. Pasidomo referred to \\"an article about an 11 year old girl who was gang-raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute.‚ÄùPassidomo claimed that \\"it‚Äôs incumbent upon [the state] to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire, so what happened in Texas doesn‚Äôt happen to [Florida's] students.‚Äù Trials In Texas, sexual assault against a person under 17 years of age is a second degree felony, and aggravated sexual assault a first degree felony. Eventually, twenty-one people were charged with crimes related to the gang rape. Only two adult males requested trials, and juries handed each defendant a 99-year prison sentence. Eleven other adult males pleaded guilty to the charges against them and received 15-year sentences in exchange. All seven juveniles entered guilty pleas and received seven-year probated prison- sentences. The twenty-first and last defendant pleaded guilty after a year long investigation whereby a DNA specimen identified him as being at the crime scene. The defendant received a reduced seven-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to indecently exposing himself to a child. All defendants sentenced to prison would be registered as sex offenders for ten years after completing the sentence. Aftermath When the investigation started, the victim's family moved to another town after police detectives told the parents that they were in danger, while the girl who was reported as raped was placed by the Child Protective Services in the care of the Girls' Haven in Beaumont, Texas. In December 2011, she ran away from the residential facility and was \\"on the streets for about a week,\\" as the Jefferson County prosecutor stated. He revealed that, at some point, she met a 30-year-old male with a prior conviction as a drug dealer in Fort Bend County, who subsequently assaulted her at his apartment in Beaumont. The assailant was arrested and pleaded guilty in September 2012 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in exchange for deferred probation. In 2013, the girl revealed she was pregnant, allegedly from her \\"15-year old boyfriend,\\" and that they would keep the baby.

From 2005 to 2016, he was a member of the Regional Assembly of Apulia, serving as an assessor under the Nichi Vendola presidency.  Biography  Minervini has been a close collaborator of bishop Antonio Bello and in 1985 he founded the \\"House of Peace\\", a point of reference for the fight against crime for many young people in the city. A progressive catholic, in 1994 Minervini was elected mayor of Molfetta as an independent supported by the Alliance of Progressives, becoming the first mayor elected directly by the people of Molfetta. He was re-elected in 1998 with the support of The Olive Tree coalition, and in that year he joined Romano Prodi's The Democrats, that later converged into Francesco Rutelli's The Daisy. During his administrative term, he laid down the conditions for the development of the industrial area of Molfetta. After the 2005 Apulian regional elections, Minervini supported the centre-left candidate Nichi Vendola and was elected regional councilor, becoming the most voted candidate in the province of Bari. Vendola appointed him Councilor for transparency and active citizenship, with delegations to sport and youth policies. Minervini was re-confirmed as regional councilor after the 2010 regional elections and this time was appointed Councilor for mobility and transports. In his ten years as councilor he was remembered for the call for the social reuse of assets confiscated from the Mafia, the reorganization of regional offices and, above all, the Bollenti spiriti program that promoted training and the start of work for thousands of young Apulians. On 31 January 2013, Minervini revealed that during the previous year he found out that he had cancer. Despite his health problems, he did not lessen his political commitment, turning his attention especially to the fight against illegal hiring. In 2014, Minervini was a candidate for the centre-left primaries to choose Vendola's successor as gubernatorial candidate, together with the former mayor of Bari Michele Emiliano and senator Dario Stefano: Minervini reached third place, behind the winner Emiliano, who was later elected governor, and Stefano. Despite his critical attitude towards Emiliano, Minervini supported him during the 2015 regional elections and was re-elected at the regional assembly as the leader of the movement Us on the Left for Apulia, becoming the group leader in the assembly.

A special task force of more than 700 soldiers, it was created at the end of August 1944 to deport or murder the remaining Jews in Slovakia following the German suppression of the Slovak National Uprising. During its seven-month existence, Einsatzgruppe H collaborated closely with the Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions and arrested 18,937 people, of whom at least 2,257 were murdered; thousands of others were deported to Nazi concentration camps (primarily Auschwitz). The victims included Jews, Romani people, actual or suspected Slovak partisans, and real or perceived political opponents. One of its component units, Einsatzkommando 14, committed the two of the largest massacres in the history of Slovakia, at Kremniƒçka and Nemeck√°. Background On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence under the protection of Nazi Germany. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the persecution of Jews was \\"central to the domestic policy of the Slovak state\\". Between 26 March and 20 October 1942, about 57,000 Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Slovakia at the time, were deported. Only a few hundred survived the war. In 1943, the defeat at Stalingrad turned many Slovaks against the Axis-aligned regime, and the government refused to continue with deportations. It was now evident to the Slovak population that Germany would not win the war, and high casualties on the Eastern Front caused many ordinary Slovaks and large sections of the army to turn against the fascist regime; many retreated to the mountains and formed partisan groups. Concerned about the increase in resistance and suspecting the loyalty of the Slovaks, Germany invaded Slovakia, precipitating the Slovak National Uprising, which broke out on 29 August 1944. The Reich Main Security Office assigned Einsatzgruppe H to implement the Final Solution in Slovakia, and deport or murder the 25,000 ethnic Jews remaining in Slovakia. Most of these were converts to Christianity, in mixed marriages, deemed essential to the economy, or protected by other exemptions that had prevented their deportation in 1942. Because of the advance of the Red Army into Poland, the Nazis wanted to deport Slovakia's remaining Jews to Auschwitz as soon as possible, as the camp would shut down its gas chambers in November. Formation Einsatzgruppe H and its two main component units, Einsatzkommandos 13 and 14, were formed in Brno (in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) upon the outbreak of the Slovak National Uprising, on 28 or 29 August. Its commander was SS- Obersturmbannfuhrer . Other German units were tasked with the military suppression of the uprising; Einsatzgruppe H's main focus was to implement the Final Solution in Slovakia. To this end, it intervened with the Slovak government and public life, carried out military actions against partisans, engaged in roundups, and committed massacres. The unit also submitted regular, detailed reports to Berlin concerning all aspects of life in Slovakia, including the military situation, Jews, public opinion, and culture. It exceeded its remit by targeting other groups, including partisans and Romani people. Military role SS General Gottlob Berger, who was appointed German military commander in Slovakia to suppress the uprising, and his superiors in Berlin, believed that the partisans would be defeated in a few days, despite warnings from Karl Hermann Frank and others. Too few German troops were dispatched, so Einsatzgruppe H was drafted into active military actions, focusing on disarming Slovak Army units perceived to be unreliable. Due to his failure to suppress the uprising, Berger was recalled after three weeks and General Hermann H√∂fle replaced him. Bansk√° Bystrica, the rebel headquarters, fell on 27 October, and the partisans shifted their strategy to guerrilla warfare. Anti-Jewish actions Two days after the outbreak of the rebellion, Witiska met with Berger; the German ambassador to Slovakia, Hans Ludin; Erich Ehrlinger of the Reich Main Security Office; and , the commander of the SS and SD in the Protectorate. The object of this meeting was to discuss how to implement a \\"radical solution\\" () to the \\"Jewish question\\" in Slovakia. Most Jews were captured during roundups; either they were imprisoned at local prisons or else taken to the Einsatzgruppe H office in Bratislava, from which they were sent to Sereƒè concentration camp for deportation. In many cases, the local authorities provided lists of Jews. By this time, the Jews knew that deportation meant probable death, so many tried to flee, go into hiding, or otherwise avoid arrest. The attitude of the local population was ambivalent; some risked their lives to hide Jews, while others turned them in to the police. Following the uprising, Einsatzgruppe H collaborated with the Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions (POHG) and a local Volksdeutsche paramilitary organization, the Heimatschutz (HS) to create an atmosphere of terror in rural Slovakia, perpetrating public executions and massacres of Jews, Romani people, and those suspected of supporting partisans. The success of Einsatzgruppe H was largely due to denunciations and the cooperation of the POHG and the HS, were able to impersonate partisans due to their local knowledge and ability to speak Slovak. These collaborators participated in the massacres, aided with interrogations, and searched houses for Jews in hiding. Organization Einsatzgruppe H was organized hierarchically as were other Einsatzgruppe units. It was run from a central headquarters in Bratislava, where Witiska maintained an office at Palis√°dy 42 with about 160 personnel. At its peak, the unit had six subunits with stationary headquarters: Sonderkommando 7a, Einsatzkommandos 13 and 14, and zb-V Kommandos 15, 27, and 29. Of these, Einsatzkommandos 13 and 14 and zb-V Kommando 27 were newly formed, while the other units had been transferred from other duties. Not all were subordinated to Einsatzgruppe H for the entirety of their activities in Slovakia; for instance, zb-V Kommando 27, which operated in eastern Slovakia from September 1944, was subordinated to the SD office in Krak√≥w until January 1945. Except for zb-V Kommando 15, dissolved in February, the units continued to exist until the occupation of Slovakia by the Red Army, at which point most of the personnel fled into Moravia. More than 700 soldiers served in Einsatzgruppe H at one point, although the exact numbers cannot be determined. Organizationally, the unit was part of the Wehrmacht, but it was never under Wehrmacht operational control. On 15 November 1944, the unit was transferred to the control of the SD and ceased to be called Einsatzgruppe H officially, but the unit maintained the same personnel. A few days later, Witiska was promoted to the head of the SiPo and SD in Slovakia, but maintained control over the unit. Although the members of the unit were very diverse in terms of age, education, and affiliation with the Nazi Party, most had previous experience with combat or rear-area operations. Some were Slovaks. =Einsatzkommando 13= Einsatzkommando 13 (sk) was commanded by Otto Koslowski, Hans Jaskulsky, and then Karl Schmitz. 446 Jews were rounded up in western and central Slovakia by Einsatzkommando 13; they were held at Ilava prison before being deported from ≈Ωilina to concentration camps in Germany. *On 13/14 September, the unit did a roundup in ≈Ωilina, arresting hundreds of Jews who were held in Sereƒè and Ilava before their deportation to concentration camps, especially Auschwitz. Few survived the war. =Einsatzkommando 14= Einsatzkommando 14 (cs, sk), commanded by , was the main unit of Einsatzgruppe H. Heuser had been the commander of the Sipo in Minsk, where he had helped organize the mass shootings of Belarusian Jews. Einsatzkommando 14 advanced behind the SS front-line unit from Nitra to Topoƒæƒçany, where it set up a temporary headquarters. In mid-September, the unit moved farther east to Ba≈•ovany, and after the fall of Bansk√° Bystrica in late October it moved to that location. The unit was responsible for 2,876 murders, including the largest massacres on Slovak territory: , with at least 747 victims, and Nemeck√° massacre, with some 900 victims. These massacres were committed in cooperation with the POHG and the HS. *On 3 September, the unit conducted a hunt for hidden Jews in Topoƒæƒçany. *On 11 September 1944, the unit shot 350 Jews at Nemƒçice (near Topoƒæƒçany), including women, children, and a four-month-old infant. *On 3 October, 48 people were shot at Martin for alleged partisan activities. *On 24 November the unit arrested 109 Romani people from the village of Ilija, including women and children, who were later shot at Kremniƒçka. *On 12 December, 31 people were removed from the prison in Brezno and murdered in a nearby field. The bodies were buried in a shallow trench and exhumed ten days later after the Germans were persuaded that it was a health hazard. Victims included several partisans and an entire Jewish family, including seven-year-old Ladislav Ferenc. *In January 1945, four alleged guerillas were hanged in Zlat√© Moravce. *Also in January, seven Jews found in hiding in Donovaly were shot along with their rescuer, and the house burned down. =Einsatzkommando 29= Einsatzkommando 29 and local collaborators committed the 28 September roundup in Bratislava, organized by Alois Brunner. On 26 September, the Germans raided the Jewish Center, obtaining a list of Jews, with which they prepared the operation. On the night of 28 September, 1,600 or 1,800 Jews in Bratislava were arrested and held in the Jewish Council's headquarters until 6 am, when they were loaded onto freight cars and transported to Sereƒè, arriving at 2 am on 30 September. They were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp later that month, where most were murdered. Notably, the victims included most of the leadership of the Working Group, a Jewish resistance organization. This was the largest roundup in Slovakia and an example of Slovak collaboration. After the September operation, Einsatzkommando 29 established an office in the former Jewish Center (Edelgasse 6) to hunt down Jews in hiding. When Jews were captured, they were interrogated and tortured if they did not give the names and addresses of other Jews in hiding. The bodies of victims who were tortured to death were thrown into the Danube. This was staffed largely from members of the Heimatschutz. Summary According to Einsatzgruppe H's official records, the unit arrested 18,937 people: 9,653 Jews, 3,409 \\"bandits\\" (actual or suspected partisans), 2,186 defectors, 714 resistance members, 172 Romani people and 546 others. Of these, 2,257 were subjected to Sonderbehandlung (summary execution). The unit captured the leaders of the uprising, Generals Jan Golian and Rudolf Viest, as well as a few American and British military personnel and German soldiers suspected of defeatism or homosexuality. After the liberation of Slovakia by the Red Army, 211 mass graves with 5,304 victims shot by Axis forces in late 1944 and early 1945 were discovered; a quarter of the victims were women and children. Some 90 villages were razed. Of the approximately 25,000 Jews present in Slovakia at the beginning of the uprising, 13,500 were deported‚Äîmost of whom died‚Äîand several hundred massacred in Slovakia. Trials Witiska committed suicide in American captivity in 1946, in order to avoid being brought to trial in Czechoslovakia. Koslowski, the commander of Einsatzkommando 13, was sentenced to death by a Czechoslovak court and executed in Brno in 1947. Twenty-two of the officers were convicted, four of them in Czechoslovakia for crimes committed in the Czech lands, three in Yugoslavia, two in Poland, and one each in Austria, Slovakia, and France (the remainder were convicted by Germany) but these convictions were for other crimes. Most members of the unit avoided prosecution for war crimes and made successful careers in West Germany. Fifteen judicial proceedings relating to the unit were opened in West Germany, mostly relating to the deportation and murder of Slovak Jews. Only one man, Silvester Weiss, was ever indicted by a German court for crimes committed as part of the unit; he was born on 27 November 1925 in Slovakia and prosecuted under juvenile law in 1964. After being convicted for his role in the murder of a hostage, he was conditionally released and did not serve any time in prison. According to Czech historian Lenka ≈†indel√°≈ôov√°, part of the failure to hold the perpetrators accountable was the lack of will on the part of German investigators, although the difficulty of obtaining evidence 20 years after the fact and statute of limitations also prevented cases from coming to trial. A few other members of Einsatzgruppe H were convicted as accomplices to murder for crimes committed with other units, but these sentences were typically light; one person was sentenced to six years in jail for the murder of 28,450 people. Heuser, responsible for Einsatzkommando 14's massacres, rose to a senior position in the West German police service before being convicted for assisting in the murder of 11,000 people in and around Minsk as a member of the Gestapo. He was released after serving six years of a 15-year sentence. The topic of Einsatzgruppe H was understudied until the publication of ≈†indel√°≈ôov√°'s book, Finale der Vernichtung: die Einsatzgruppe H in der Slowakei 1944/1945 (End of the Extermination: the Einsatzgruppe H in Slovakia 1944/1945) in 2013. It was based on her dissertation at the University of Stuttgart.

They are best known for the role they played in murdering Jews, Romani people, and actual or suspected Slovak partisans in conjunction with Einsatzgruppe H, especially for their participation in the Kremniƒçka massacre. Formation Many Slovak Army units and Slovak gendarmes sided with the rebels during the Slovak National Uprising. Relying on German troops to suppress the uprising was politically undesirable. Therefore, the Hlinka Guard, the paramilitary force of the clericofascist Slovak People's Party, was drafted to combat the partisans. President Jozef Tiso was an influential advocate of this, because he saw the Hlinka Guard as loyal to the Slovak State. Slovak fascist propaganda claimed that the uprising had been fomented by the Czech and Jewish minorities, considered \\"enemies of the state\\" because of their alleged support for Czechoslovakism and Communism respectively. Although many Czechs and Jews had been expelled from Slovakia, some had been allowed to remain. Their deportation or murder was seen as an integral part of the suppression of the uprising, and the Hlinka Guard was the preferred tool for the Slovak State's racial persecutions. The commander of the Hlinka Guard, Alexander Mach, accused moderate Hlinka Guardsmen of being too \\"soft\\" and allowing the uprising to occur. Other Hlinka Guardsmen accused Mach of being soft on the rebels, and he was removed from his position and replaced with Otomar Kubala. Because of doubts about the loyalty of certain elements of the Hlinka Guard, it was decided to create a new organization within the Hlinka Guard for the suppression of the uprising. POHG companies began to separate from the rest of the Hlinka Guard in early September, during the first weeks of the uprising. Its intended purpose was to restore the Axis Slovak State's control over central Slovakia in conjunction with German troops, and to persecute real and supposed enemies of the Slovak State. The Hlinka Guard had previously assaulted Jews in public during the first years of the regime, enriched itself through the process of \\"Aryanization\\" (confiscation of Jewish-owned businesses and property), and participated in the forcible roundups that sent two-thirds of Slovakia's Jews to death camps in 1942. Organization and personnel Some of its personnel were previously members of the Hlinka Guard or Hlinka Youth, but many Hlinka Guardsmen refused to join the special companies. Hundreds of men volunteered, but many of these were motivated by economic reasons or to avoid being drafted into the regular army. Nevertheless, the manpower needs exceeded willing recruits, and Kubala authorized local commanders to draft eligible men, both Guardsmen and non- Guardsmen, as needed. A significant number who received these notices managed to evade the authorities or were imprisoned for refusing to serve. Under new regulations making the POHG legally part of the armed forces, those who refused to serve in it were subject to a 5,000 Slovak koruna fine and up to 3 months imprisonment. Deserters could be shot. Those who had participated in the uprising, even under threat of violence from partisans in partisan- controlled areas, were also forbidden to join, but in practice many did anyway and were even promoted to positions of responsibility within the POHG. The shortage of NCOs and officers was partially solved by drafting personnel from the regular Hlinka Guard into the POHG. Membership in the units did not necessarily correlate with sympathy for fascism, Nazism, or antisemitism. There was a high rate of desertion from the units during their short existence. Originally, guards were paid 11.50 Ks per day, regardless of rank, paid out three times a month; later this became 1,500 Ks monthly for married men and 800 Ks for single men. Guardsmen often had to pay for food and uniforms out of pocket, but their employers were required to continue to pay them their previous salary (they were later compensated by the government) and forbidden to fire them after returning from active service in the POHG. POHG members were also entitled to additional food rations and cigarettes. Some POHG members wore their old Hlinka Guard uniforms, others had Slovak Army or even Wehrmacht uniforms despite strict regulations requiring them to have appropriate uniforms. They were distinguished by a special ribbon on the left sleeve. POHG members were frequently drunk, leading to quarrels with the regular army, German soldiers, and even the Slovak civilian authorities. Military actions The initial actions of the POHG against the partisans were hampered by difficulty of communication with headquarters. Because of the danger of partisans intercepting messages‚Äîsome Hlinka Guardsmen even joined the partisans, giving an opportunity for false flag operations‚Äîpasswords were introduced and the POHG uniform was altered slightly. When communication with their superiors was not possible, local units collaborated closely with nearby German forces. Because the Germans did not trust them, the POHG mostly performed auxiliary military tasks during the suppression of the uprising, rather than frontline combat. When POHG units did confront the enemy directly, they often ran away; other POHG dragged their feet when ordered into contested territory, foiling German offensives. The first unit to join the fighting, led by ≈†tefan Rabin, did not begin to engage in combat until the end of September, when the suppression of the rebellion was already well underway. It only suffered the loss of 5 killed and 15 wounded, indicating that it was not involved in heavy fighting. This unit was also one of the most brutal in its treatment of captured Jews and partisans. The overall combat effectiveness of the POHG was limited; many of its personnel were middle-aged men with families, who took all opportunities to avoid danger. This tendency reduced morale among POHG units and led to tensions with German forces, who had to take on dangerous engagements without help. One POHG unit, training in the Bratislava area, rioted when it learned that it might be expected to fight against advancing Red Army forces; many of its members deserted despite the death penalty. Partisan groups often set ambushes and lured POHG units with anonymous tipoffs about Jews in hiding, a tactic that proved effective. German hopes of recruiting significant numbers of POHG men into the Waffen-SS for deployment on the approaching Eastern Front never materialized. Slovak propaganda claimed the overall Hlinka Guard as superior to the regular armed forces, emphasizing the POHG's loyalty to the regime and glossing over their military failure. The Slovak Army's loyalty to the Slovak people was brought into question due to their support for the uprising, and it was accused of being a hotbed of \\"Bolshevism\\", which had no basis in fact. Criminality About 5% of Emergency Divisions personnel committed war crimes. The POHG cooperated closely with Einsatzgruppe H, a Nazi German death squad created to murder or deport Slovakia's remaining Jews, during the entirety of its existence. Officially, captured partisans were the responsibility of the Germans, while gendarmes who joined the partisans and Jews were at the disposal of the POHG, but this distinction was often blurred in practice. Einstazgruppe H's intelligence personnel, in reports to their superiors, emphasized the help that the POHG provided during roundups of Jews for deportation to Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. According to Czech historian Lenka ≈†indel√°≈ôov√°, the success of Einsatzgruppe H was largely due to denunciations and the cooperation of the POHG guardsmen, who could impersonate partisans due to their local knowledge and ability to speak Slovak. POHG men participated in the massacres and aided with interrogations, as well as searching houses for Jews in hiding. Many members of the POHG refused to execute captured partisans, but few refused to murder or round up Jews. Einsatzgruppe H took the initiative in many of the massacres of partisans, requiring POHG members to be present at executions. POHG executions of captured partisans were justified based on war crimes allegedly committed by partisans which were emphasized in fascist propaganda. On one occasion, the POHG summarily executed partisans who had previously been disarmed by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), and the POHG also committed war crimes in concert with the Waffen-SS Galizen Division. However, some guards criticized the German practices of looting the local population and refused to participate in executions. Two POHG soldiers who had just joined a few days previously to avoid military service shot captured partisans at Ilava prison. Although Einsatzgruppe H complained that POHG members tried to save acquaintances who had been captured as partisans, some victims of POHG atrocities have become famous symbols of anti-fascism, especially Mirek Ne≈°por, who allegedly committed suicide after being tortured by the POHG at Vlƒçova Street in Bratislava. On 1 September, the German authorities decided to use the POHG as the main means of implementing the Final Solution in Slovakia. There was little resistance within the POHG to murdering Jewish citizens; the Hlinka Guard had a history of committing anti-Jewish violence, and many guardsmen could not resist the opportunity to enrich themselves by stealing from murdered Jews. Kubala ordered that all property stolen from Jews be deposited in a special account in a Bratislava bank, but in practice most property was appropriated by the unit involved in the persecution of Jews. Corruption was so rampant that some POHG men were imprisoned for theft and special sections had to be formed for anti-Jewish persecutions to minimize the amount of Jewish property appropriated by individual guardsmen. There were several instances in which captured Jews were tortured in hopes of obtaining property that the Jews had allegedly hidden. Frequently, Jews were released if they could pay a bribe. One POHG man noticed a man of Jewish appearance in a Trenƒç√≠n restaurant; despite the man's documents stating him to be a Catholic, the guardsman forced him to undress. Noticing that the man was circumcised, the guardsman extorted valuables before releasing him. The Fifth Company of the POHG helped murder at least 282 people as part of the Kremniƒçka massacre along with Einsatzkommando 14, a subunit of Einsatzgruppe H. The POHG also participated in the Nemeck√° massacre in January 1945; several hundred people were murdered. Slovak collaborators who had been present at massacres frequently lied about their involvement in order to avoid prosecution, for example claiming that they had been threatened and coerced into participating in the massacre by German SD members and only shot over victims' heads. Other Slovak collaborators bragged about their murders, despite strict orders to keep the crimes confidential. Therefore, it is impossible to know the exact role that individual soldiers played in the massacre, but even those who did not shoot still contributed to the killings by guarding the perimeter and performing other auxiliary tasks. Liberation of Slovakia During the Bratislava-Brno Offensive in which Slovakia was liberated by the Red Army, most POHG men remained home with their families and avoided fighting, despite an attempt at evacuation by Kubala. Of 5,867 men in active service in the POHG in the second half of March, only 1,600 evacuated as ordered. Some of these evacuees fought in Moravia or in Austria during later Red Army offensives. POHG members who made it far enough west to surrender to the United States Army participated in skirmishes with German forces that resisted surrender. Eventually, they were turned over to the Soviets, based on international agreements. Aftermath Returning POHG members faced property confiscation, loss of civil rights, and imprisonment; most of the major leaders were executed for their role in war crimes. A few managed to remain in the West and went into exile. After the 1948 Communist coup, the amount of scrutiny lessened; most guards reintegrated into society. Some joined the Communist Party and obtained positions of influence in the new state. In 1958, fifteen POHG members were tried for their participation in the Kremniƒçka and Nemeck√° massacres; five were sentenced to death. During the Communist era, the POHG were portrayed as loyal agents of the Nazi regime and their role in war crimes was emphasized in order to delegitimize the institutions of the Slovak State. Former members of the POHG were prosecuted for their membership in the organization; some were tortured and forced to give false confessions. At the same time, some anti-communists perceived the POHG as heroic forces fighting against communism and for Slovak nationalism, while glossing over the units' participation in war crimes. They continue to be the focus of far-right commemorations.

He acceded following the resignation of his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Matar Al Qasimi, the head of the Al Qasimi after some 30 years' rule. Saqr married the daughter of Sheikh Abdullah Al Ma'in of Qishm, a key ally of his father's and the former Sheikh of Qishm, cementing an alliance between the Ma'in and the Al Qasimi which consolidated Al Qasimi power in Qishm and Lingeh and gave them effective control of the access point to the Persian Gulf. Saqr's strong leadership helped the Al Qasimi expand their trading links, gaining a foothold in the coastal towns Charaj, Lingeh and Shinas on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf, the islands of Siri, Qishm and Qais and Ras Al Khaimah (which was already in their hands) and Rams on the Arabian coast, an area known as Sir at the time.  Accusations of piracy  At some time around the handover of power from Rashid to Saqr, the first accusation of piracy against the Al Qasimi was made by the British, after a vessel owned by the East India Company was taken off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah. Pressed by the British to explain their actions, the Al Qasimi response, from Rashid himself, was that the vessel was flying the colours of the Imam of Muscat, with whom the Al Qasimi were at war. An investigation led to a note written by Francis Warden, Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, which stated that not until 1796 could he trace an act of aggression by the Al Qasimi against the British flag. Nevertheless, the die was cast ‚Äì the Al Qasimi would come into increasing conflict with the ally of their enemy in Muscat ‚Äì the British. In May 1797, the snow Bassein was boarded by Al Qasimi, but on recognising it as a British vessel, the boarders were instructed to leave the ship and it was allowed to proceed to Basra. In response to a protest from the British government, Saqr wrote: \\"God forbid I should think of capturing your vessels.\\" A further incident involving the Viper in Bushire then took place in September 1797, when the British boat became involved in a conflict between Al Qasimi and Omani boats, itself taking fire from the Al Qasimi. Again, Saqr protested friendship with the British and promised to bring his nephew, Sheikh Saleh, who had been in command of the Al Qasimi boats, to justice. At the turn of the century, the Wahhabi forces of the First Saudi Kingdom started to encroach on the area and their threat against the Buraimi oasis caused the Sultan of Muscat to seek peace with Saqr. On his death in 1803, Saqr was succeeded by his son, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi.
