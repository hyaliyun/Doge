Starting in late March and ending in mid-April, the rains caused several major rivers to rise and/or overflow their banks, partly or completely flooded many towns and large cities, ruined a significant part of the crops in a wide region, and severely damaged the physical infrastructure. At least 15 people were killed as a result of the flooding.http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/index.php?report=hazards&year;=2007&month;=mar Affected area The area hit by the main storm was the central and southern Argentine Litoral region, comprising the south-center of Santa Fe Province (west of the Paran√° River) and the south of Entre R√≠os Province (east of the Paran√° River). The latter is part of the southern Mesopotamia (lit. \\"between rivers\\", thus called because it lies within the drainage basin of the Paran√° and the Uruguay River). Increased rainfall also hit locations in the northeast of Buenos Aires Province, along the course of the Paran√°, before it empties into the R√≠o de la Plata (beside which Buenos Aires is located). Associated storms hit the southeast of C√≥rdoba Province, immediately west of Santa Fe. The largest metropolitan areas in the affected area were Santa Fe (pop. 460,000) and Rosario (pop. 1.2 million). Tens of other cities and towns were also affected, including Rafaela (pop. 84,000) in central Santa Fe and Gualeguay (pop. 39,000) in southern Entre R√≠os. The southern Argentine littoral is the heart of the Humid Pampa and the most productive farming region in the country, producing a large portion of the beef, cereals and dairy commodities consumed or exported. Only in Santa Fe Province, the storms ruined 30,000 km¬≤ of crops and rendered important regions of pasture land unusable. =Watercourses= The main river in the affected area is the Paran√° River, which is the second longest in South America after the Amazon. It forms the natural limit between the provinces of Santa Fe and Entre R√≠os, and empties into the R√≠o de la Plata. The Paran√°‚ÄìPlata system thus passes by Argentina's most densely populated area. Other affected watercourses were: * In Santa Fe, the right-hand-side (western) tributaries of the Paran√°: near Santa Fe City, the Salado River; farther south, the Carcara√±√° River; and in Rosario, the Ludue√±a Stream and the Saladillo Stream. * In Entre R√≠os: the Gualeguay River, which divides the province in two. Development On 26 March 2007 a rainstorm started in the area around Rosario. With few interruptions, the rain continued for about a week. Rosario is traversed by the Ludue√±a Stream in the north; its southern border is partly defined by the Saladillo Stream. The Ludue√±a has historically been prone to overflowing, which has prompted the construction of works (canals and piping) to contain and derive its waters. Soon after the beginning of the rain, the Ibarlucea Canal (which empties into the main course of the Ludue√±a, overflowed and flooded several neighbourhoods in the northwest of Rosario. At the peak of the crisis, on 31 March, about 4,000 people were evacuated in several emergency centers throughout the city. As the strong rain started to subside in Rosario, the storms were moving north towards the area of Santa Fe, the provincial capital. Santa Fe is built on low-lying terrain at the junction of the Salado and Paran√° rivers, and is still recovering from a flood caused by the Salado in 2003. This time, however, both rivers were rising. At some point, the physical barriers that had been set in place against the rise of the Paran√° River prevented the natural drainage of the flood waters brought by the Salado. The existing pumps were not enough, and there was a delay bringing extra ones. As the neighbouring areas were flooded and the incoming roads submerged or damaged, Santa Fe became practically isolated with the exception of the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel. About 20,000 people were displaced or evacuated. The provincial government decreed a state of hydrical emergency on 29 March. Evacuees were sent to military and private facilities (such as sports clubs and schools), where they were given food and shelter, and the risk population (mainly children) was vaccinated. After the end of the emergency, as the first estimates of the damages were released, the provincial government set aside funds (620 million Argentine pesos, about 200 million USD) to assist the affected towns and cities; of these, AR$30 million were assigned to each of Santa Fe City and Rosario.

It opened in 1772. History The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal opened in April 1772, connecting Great Haywood Junction on the Trent and Mersey Canal to Stourport on the River Severn. The Birmingham Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament dated 24 February 1768. It would run from Birmingham to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire main line at Autherley, which was also known as Aldersley at the time. An unusual clause in the Act made provision for the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal to build the junction between the two canals themselves, if the Birmingham company failed to complete it within six months of opening their canal. They could also charge the Birmingham company for the full cost of the construction. The Birmingham company lost no time in opening the route from Birmingham to Wednesbury, where there were collieries, but were less keen in the opinion of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire, to complete the link to their canal. Work began on the link in early 1770, but in May the Staffordshire and Worcestershire attempted to obtain a mandamus writ, which would have compelled the other company to make the junction. They failed to get one, and so in January 1771 they presented a bill to Parliament to authorise them to make the junction. At this point, the Birmingham company negotiated, paid the costs of the bill, and agreed to press on quickly with the link. It was no small task, as it involved a flight of 20 locks (later increased to 21) to drop the level of the canal between Wolverhampton and the junction. The junction opened for traffic on 21 September 1772, some five months after the Staffordshire and Worcestershire had opened. The names Autherley and Aldersley continued to be used interchangeably until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal opened their canal to join the Chester Canal to a new junction around further to the north. At this point, Autherley was applied to the northern junction and Aldersley to the southern junction. Prior to the opening of the new canal, there had been considerable trade on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal between the Potteries and the south-western cities of Gloucester and Bristol, and also trade in manufactured goods north from Birmingham. The Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, however, was one of the new generation of canals, which rather than winding across the countryside following the contours, used embankments and cuttings to create a more direct route, and tended to group the locks into flights. It was therefore shorter and quicker, with the result that much of the trade which had formerly travelled the from Aldersley to Great Haywood Junction now travelled the short distance between Aldersley and Autherley. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire raised the tolls for this stretch to absurd levels, in an attempt to reduce their losses. In order to resolve the situation, the Birmingham Canal company worked with the Liverpool Junction company, and proposed the Tettenhall and Autherley Canal and Aqueduct. This would have left the Birmingham Canal just above lock 19, crossed the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal just below Aldersley Junction by an aqueduct made of iron, and then dropped down through three locks to join the Liverpool Junction Canal above the stop lock. The plans were drawn up by Dugdale Houghton, a firm of surveyors from Birmingham,Staffs and Worcs Canal Society: It could have been different but the canal was never constructed, as the Staffordshire and Worcestershire company reduced their tolls rather than lose them altogether. Location Aldersley Junction is on the summit level of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which is at a height of around above sea level. The pound continues for to the north before reaching Gailey Lock, the first one that starts the descent to Great Haywood Junction. To the south, Compton Lock is away, and starts the descent to Stourbridge. The Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal became part of the Shropshire Union Canal network in 1846. There is a stop lock just after Autherley Junction, which drops the level by just a few inches, and then a level pound of before the first real lock at Wheaton Aston. The Birmingham Canal became part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, and the first of 21 locks which raise the canal up to the level is located immediately after the junction.

The village lies on the B3098 Westbury‚ÄìUrchfont road which skirts the edge of the Plain. The parish includes the hamlets of Northbrook, Lavington Sands and Fiddington Sands.  History  There was a Roman settlement near the present parish church, which was followed by a Saxon settlement, including a cemetery which was used in the 5th to 7th centuries. Thus the area was continuously occupied from the late Roman period until the establishment of the medieval planned town in the 13th century. The archaeology was assessed in advance of housebuilding to the northwest of the church in 1991‚Äì5, and building of the community centre and car park southwest of the church in 2006. Domesday Book has two entries for Laventone, with a large combined population of 38 households, 12 acres of woodland and three mills. The ancient parish included the detached tithing of Gore, about south of Market Lavington church, where a manor was recorded in Domesday Book; this area was transferred to West Lavington in 1884 and is now farmland. At the same time the tithing of Fiddington, a narrow strip separating Market Lavington from Easterton, was transferred from West Lavington. In 1254 Richard Rochelle, a landowner, was granted a charter to hold a weekly market, which competed with markets at Devizes and Steeple Ashton. Markets continued to be held until the mid-19th century. Thomas Tanner, who became Bishop of St Asaph, was born in 1674 at Market Lavington where his father (also Thomas) was vicar.  Transport  The Wessex Ridgeway, a long-distance footpath following the ancient track known as The Ridgeway, runs along the top of the escarpment above Market Lavington and passes within half a mile of the village. Market Lavington developed around a crossroads where an east-west road (now the B3098) met a north-south road from Devizes to Salisbury. The latter was closed south of Market Lavington after the War Department purchased land for military use in 1889, and the road through West Lavington (now the A360) became the route to Salisbury. The Stert and Westbury Railway, part of the route from London to Taunton, was built through the parish by the Great Western Railway in 1900. At the same time a station named Lavington was built a short distance outside Market Lavington parish, north of Littleton Panell where the line crosses the A360. It was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest stations are Pewsey and Westbury.  Status and amenities  Market Lavington was formerly considered to be a town and received a Royal Charter to hold a weekly market in the year 1254. The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The parish falls in the Lavingtons and Erlestoke electoral ward. This ward starts in the south at West Lavington and stretches north to Worton. The total population of the parish taken at the 2011 census was 5,857. The village has a co-op supermarket, a pharmacist, a butcher, a post office, a florist, a hairdresser, a pub, a caf√© and other small businesses. There is also a nursing and residential home.  Parish church  St Mary's Church The parish church of St Mary, in the west of the village, is from the late 13th century. There is evidence of an earlier building in fragments of 12th-century stonework remounted as a cornice in the south porch, and other fragments elsewhere in the church. In the 14th century the porch was added and the aisles widened; the tower was completed in the 15th. The six bells in the tower were recast in 1876. During restoration by Ewan Christian in 1864, the chancel arch, the nave and parts of the aisle walls were rebuilt, and buttresses were added to the south aisle. Further restoration in 1910 added the organ chamber and choir vestry, and the east wall was rebuilt. There is a 14th-century piscina. Monuments include a marble carving of a mourning woman by John Flaxman, a memorial to Thomas Sainsbury (died 1795). The building was recorded as Grade I listed in 1962. The tithing of Easterton became a separate parish with its own church in 1874. The benefices of Market Lavington and Easterton were united in 1962. Today the church is part of the Lavingtons, Cheverells & Easterton benefice, a group of five churches. A chapel at Gore was in existence by 1322. Around 1550 the chapel was still standing but unused, and it was later demolished. Other buildings The Old House, a 14th-century manor house, is Grade I listed. Built of roughcast stone with some brick, it contains the structure of an early medieval double-aisled open hall, described by Historic England as the only example in Wiltshire. The building was remodelled in the late 17th or early 18th century, and restored in 1875. A new manor house, with service block and stables, was built in 1865 by Ewan Christian for Edward Pleydell-Bouverie, a politician and Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The construction is red brick, with blue brick patterning and stone dressings. Since 1926 it has been owned by Dauntsey's School. The Market Lavington Community Hall was built in 2007 and can accommodate 160 people seated or 250 standing. It hosts regular activities such as short mat bowls, quilting, Tai Chi, yoga, Women's Institute, art, table tennis, a community choir and ballroom dancing. The Old School has been converted into community space for hire and hosts clubs such as Girl Guides and a play group. Market Lavington Museum is sited in the old Schoolmaster‚Äôs Cottage at the back of the churchyard. It is open Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday and Bank Holiday afternoons from 2.30 to 4.30 pm between 1 May and 30 October. Schools Lavington School is a secondary school with a sixth form. The village also has a primary school, St Barnabas. The village is less than two miles from Dauntsey's School, an independent secondary school in West Lavington.

Rogers was also a women's rights activist and suffragette. Early life Aurelia Read Spencer was born at Deep River, Middlesex County, Connecticut, the eldest child of Orson Spencer and Catherine Cannon Curtis. When Aurelia was 12 years old, her mother died at Sugar Creek, Iowa. A few months later, her father was asked by Brigham Young to become the new mission president for the church in Europe. As the second eldest child, Aurelia and her elder sister were made responsible for assisting the other four siblings in the move to the Salt Lake Valley, which the Spencer children completed in 1848. Orson Spencer returned from Europe in September 1849 and joined the family in Salt Lake City. Marriage and family On March 27, 1851, Aurelia married Thomas Rogers in Salt Lake City. The Rogers moved to Farmington, Utah Territory, where Rogers would raise seven children. Founding the Primary Association In 1878, Rogers had become concerned that younger Latter-day Saint children had too much unsupervised time. In particular, Rogers felt that the younger boys in the community were becoming unruly and mischievous. While praying for guidance, Rogers said she heard a voice say \\"that there was an auxiliary organization [in the church] for all ages except the children\\".Church Educational System, Church History in the Fulness of Times, rev. ed., Salt Lake City: LDS Church, 1993, p. 410. Rogers met with the LDS Church president John Taylor and received permission to operate a church organization for children. With the assistance of general Relief Society president Eliza R. Snow, Rogers organized a Primary Association for her local Farmington ward on August 11, 1878. Two weeks later, the first meeting was held on August 25, with 115 children in attendance. That day, boys were specifically taught not to steal fruit from orchards and girls were taught not to hang on wagons. In addition, they were given lessons on faith, manners, obedience, and other principles. Snow assisted the church in spreading Primary to other church congregations. In 1880, Primary was adopted churchwide as the official organization for children in the LDS Church. From 1893 until her death, Rogers served on the general board of the Primary organization. Suffragette Rogers was a delegate to the Woman's Suffrage Convention in Georgia in 1895. That same year, she was a delegate to the meeting of Susan B. Anthony's National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. Death Rogers died in Farmington, Utah at the age of 87.State of Utah Death Certificate See also *Richard Ballantyne *William R.

Son of William Henry Vanderbilt and grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, George W. Vanderbilt pioneered sustainable land-use practices when he moved from New York to the Southern Appalachian Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina, where he built his famed Biltmore Estate, America's largest residence.  History  Based on his passion for creating sustainable forestry and agricultural practices, Vanderbilt launched Biltmore Dairy Farms as an internal operation on his estate, with surplus milk being donated to local Asheville hospitals. As productivity increased, the company expanded into home delivery and wholesale supply to area hotels, then part of Western North Carolina's nascent tourism industry. Imported from the UK (specifically from the Channel Islands), Jersey cows, known for producing high-quality milk, comprised the original Biltmore Farms herd. Biltmore cattle were regularly awarded blue ribbons at the National Jersey Shows, and several even earned grand champion titles. One notable Biltmore Farms cow, Financial Madame Bess, was recognized for producing . of milk in one ten-month period, which was a national record at the time. Biltmore Signal Bess Jane was also recognized, earning the title of Grand Champion Cow in both 1951 and 1952 at the National Jersey Shows. The year 1952 also marked bull Dandy Royal‚Äôs win of a Grand Champion title, setting a new record by being bred, owned and exhibited by the same entity. The record stands unbeaten today. In 1979, a corporate reorganization made Biltmore Farms a separate entity from The Biltmore Company, which operates the Vanderbilt's estate house, gardens, and winery. Under the leadership of Vanderbilt's grandson George H. V. Cecil, the dairy operation grew throughout the latter half of the twentieth century to serve customers in five states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia. 'Biltmore Dairy Bars and milk delivery trucks became iconic symbols. One can still visit the original dairy barn, which has been converted into the Biltmore Winery. The end of actual farming Due to changing trends in the market, the dairy business was sold to Pet, Inc. in 1985, though Biltmore Farms still maintains a herd of Jersey cattle in Mills River, North Carolina, just south of Asheville. The pedigrees of many of these cows can still be traced to the original nineteenth-century herd. Biltmore Farms transformed itself into a community development firm. The company's present day divisions, operated by more than 140 employees, focus on hotels, commercial real estate, home building, and master planned communities. The company's first foray into real estate development began after Pet, Inc. vacated the dairy processing plant just outside the Biltmore Estate gates. Adaptive reuse transformed the building into a full-service hotel operation, now branded as The Doubletree Biltmore Hotel, a member of the Hilton Hotels Family. The hotel features a museum of the company's agricultural legacy, and the adjacent T.G.I. Friday's restaurant was the original location of the Asheville Dairy Bar. Current Business John F. A. V. ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Cecil was promoted to company president in 1992 and has focused its ventures on his five tenets of community development: healthcare, education, economic development, quality of life and the environment, and the arts and crafts of the region. Business includes: * Biltmore Farms Communities * Biltmore Lake' - a community surrounding a 62-acre lake in Western North Carolina. * Biltmore Park - a community located in south Asheville, North Carolina. 550 homes surrounds the Urban Village, Biltmore Park Town Square. * Biltmore Farms Homes - the company's homebuilding subsidiary builds in several Asheville and Hendersonville, North Carolina, area communities including Biltmore Lake, Southcliff, and Fox Run Preserve. * Biltmore Farms Hotels * Biltmore Farms Commercial - the company has a variety of commercial real estate interests, including leasing and property management.

The plane was an unsuccessful model, with the Bristol Bulldog being selected instead.  Development  The A.W.14 Starling was developed by Armstrong Whitworth to meet the requirements of Specification 28/24, for a single-seat fighter capable of operating in day and night-time conditions to replace Armstrong Whitworth's earlier Siskin. It was a single-bay sesquiplane (a biplane with the lower wing much smaller than the upper) with staggered unequal span wings. The fuselage had a bolted steel-tube structure, while the wings had steel spars and wooden ribs and were fitted with ailerons on the upper wings only. The wings used the experimental RAF 30 aerofoil section, which is symmetrical, with zero camber. Armament was two synchronised .303 in Vickers machine guns.Tapper 1988, pp. 168‚Äì170.Mason 1992, p. 189.Flight 2 August 1928, pp. 660‚Äì665. Two prototypes were ordered, with the first J8027, powered by a 385 hp (287 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar VII radial engine flying on 12 May 1927. It proved to be underpowered with this engine, and was therefore re-engined with a 460 hp (340 kW) Jaguar V engine. Performance was still unimpressive however, with the first prototype not exceeding speeds of 160 mph (260 km/h) rather than the expected 180 mph (290 km/h), while low speed handling was poor.Tapper 1988, p. 170. The prototype was evaluated against the later Specification F.9/26 in February 1926, but was rejected by the RAF, who instead selected the Bristol Bulldog. J8027 was returned to Armstrong Whitworth, who fitted it with new wings with Clark YH aerofoil section and leading edge slots fitted on the upper wings.Tapper 1988, pp. 170‚Äì171. It was given the civil registration G-AAHC in May 1929, and was shown at Olympia in London in July 1929. It was cancelled from the register in December 1930.Jackson 1974, p. 323. The second prototype, J8028 was heavily redesigned, with a more streamlined fuselage and revised wings, which although retaining the Clark YH aerofoil section, had smaller lower wings.Tapper 1988, pp. 173, 175. It was powered by a 525 hp (391 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Panther II engine, first flying on 5 December 1929.

The entrance to the villa is located at 4, Via Ludovico di Savoia. History The villa was originally owned by a Russian princess, Zena«êde Wolkonsky (born Zena«êde Alexandrovna Belosselsky-Belozersky), who made her home there in the 1830s. Her salon was frequented by Karl Brullov, Alexander Ivanov, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Gaetano Donizetti, Stendhal, and Sir Walter Scott. Nikolai Gogol wrote much of Dead Souls at the villa. Subsequently, it passed through various owners until it was sold to the German government in 1920, becoming the German embassy and ambassador's residence. After the Liberation of Rome in 1944, the Italian government sequestrated the property, and it was placed under the Allied Control Commission. For a short time, it was occupied by the Swiss legation and then the Italian Red Cross. When the British Embassy at Rome's Porta Pia was blown up by members of the clandestine militant Zionist group Irgun on 31 October 1946, the Italian government made the Villa Wolkonsky available to the British government to use as a temporary embassy and residence. The United Kingdom purchased the villa in 1951. When the new British Embassy was reopened at its original location in 1971, the offices moved back to Porta Pia, and the villa reverted to its role as Her Majesty's Ambassador's Residence. On the same grounds are outbuildings containing apartments for senior embassy officials. The villa itself is frequently used for seminars and workshops, and it is also rented out to appropriate academic or commercial organisations for major events.

Its partner town (sister city) is Wiesthal, Germany. Aerial photograph of V√°rosl≈ëd History V√°rosl≈ëd, or Waschludt (German), was established after the end of Ottoman rule in 1699, when German settlers from Mainz, the Rhine area and the Spessart came to the region. It was a popular migratory area due to its woods and the rich resources of clay and ore. Thus, many settlers built glass and iron-hammer factories or worked as lime-burners. The first foreman was Rubner P√©ter J√°nos who had come to V√°rosl≈ëd from the region of Linz with his family and a group of iron workers. Business leaders and Foremen that followed were of German origin as well, such as Michael Gasteiger from Upper Bavaria and Ferdinand Adler from Moravia who came from a famous dynasty of glass factory owners. Alongside the craftsmen, the manufactures of V√°rosl≈ëd played a big role in the city's economy. Vince Stingl and K√°roly Stingl founded a small pottery in the early 19th century which soon was very successful. They mostly produced tableware but also water bottles, vases, pots, jars and tiles. For some time, they even had their porcelain painted in V√°rosl≈ëd. Later on, Vince Stingl founded the now famous Herend Porcelain Factory. Culture V√°rosl≈ëd has a long history of German culture, and has a German Culture Museum in the city The village also has a heritage museum which displays everyday objects of Danube Swabians. The Museum preserves the traditions of Germans of Hungary and frequently offers events, such as the Ball of Swabians. Furthermore, the local choir and folklore dance group have a 40-year-old tradition of Hungarian and Swabian performances which contribute to the commemoration of the history of Danube Swabians. The baroque church, which was built on the foundations of a former gothic monastery, is worth visiting. The monastery was the site of the √ârdy Codex of 1527. In the park next to the church, a memorial for displaced people can be found which commemorates the partnership between V√°rosl≈ëd and the Bavarian Wiesthal. Furthermore, a hero memorial displaying V√°rosl≈ëd's victims of World War I and II can be seen.

However, in 1969 the villages of Veszpr√©mpink√≥c and Zalagalsa were combined creating Veszpr√©mgalsa. History The name Galsa is derived from the Galsa personal name derived from Slavic origin, and the Zala prefix refers to the former county affiliation. First mentioned in 1268 . Near the end of the 14th century, the estate of Benedek Himfi was sold by sale. At that time, approx. 1500 hold. The estate of the Himfiek was owned by Ferenc Esegv√°ri. From 1420 the village of Csabi Bazs√≥ owns the village. The two families held it until the end of the 16th century . In 1627 a part of the village was in Eszterh√°zy, and the other was in the hands of public owners. From the noble society of Galsa, the Polgar family stands out, (in 1700 Istvan Polg√°r was listed as a nobleman and one of Galsa's holders). The settlement was a serf village in the 16th and 17th centuries . In the middle of the 1660s the village was depopulated. In 1700 and 1711, Galsa resided again, and settled permanently in the 1720s . Livelihoods of the village are farming and livestock breeding. The village has a large millstone. In 1366, three mills were recorded in the water of S√°rosd, and in 1662 there was a water mill at the eastern end of the village in the direction of the village of S√°rosd. In 1724 it was mentioned in the name of K≈ëmalom, and in 1799 the two-wheeled mills were mentioned. The population of the population grew from the 1720s. In 1890 he had five hundred inhabitants. This number was only overwhelmed after the merger with Veszpr√©mpink√≥c, and the population has been declining since then. In 1773, Galsa's people were Hungarian and free. In 1700, its population was declared evangelical, and later the number of Catholics grew. In 1778 a new church was built in honor of Peter and Paul. The population of the village was less developed during the 19th century, and in 1890 it had five hundred inhabitants. In 1949, 74% of the population lived in agriculture, and 97 of the active earners were commuters . The organization began in 1959, essentially from that point on, the stationary way of life began to disappear. Veszpr√©mpink√≥c's name is also of Slavic origin. The Pink√≥c name was first recorded in 1764, noblemen, most of them Catholics. In 1785 he belonged as a daughters to T√ºskev√°r. In 1785 he had 119 inhabitants.

Veszpr√©mpink√≥c and Zalagalsa became a village under the name of Veszpr√©mgalsa ( 1969), [3] and also a common headquarters, to which Hoszt√≥t, Szentimrefalva and Zalaszegv√°r belonged as a community. [4] The joint council was merged with the independent council of Csabrends in 1977, and the new headquarters became the latter municipality. [5] In 1970, Veszpr√©mgals had 564 inhabitants, with four streets and 150 residential units. The majority of the population worked in the mines in Ajka and in industrial plants, in the local and regional units, and the main activity was animal breeding and farming. The electricity was inflamed in the village in 1949. Since 1990, it has an autonomous local government, it belongs to the Csabrendek district notary . The village has covered wastes with water, gas, telephone network and paved roads. Institutions: club library, doctor's office, village hall. Polg√°r Family The Polg√°r family were the primary noble family of Galsa. On March 20, 1640 King Ferdinand III granted Count Gy√∂rgy Polg√°r de Galsa (Gy√∂rgy galsai Polg√°r in Hungarian) the village of Galsa. The Polg√°r family heirs are the descendants of Matthias Polg√°r de Galsa of Sisak Croatia and Andor Polg√°r de Galsa in Budapest.

In a military context, checkpoints involve the setup of a hasty roadblock by mobile truck- or armored vehicle- mounted infantry to disrupt unauthorized or unwanted movement or military activity and to check for valid identification and search for contraband, fugitives, or weapons that are not permitted in civilian hands. Random checkpoints are set up to achieve surprise, as opposed to known permanently located checkpoints, which suspects could circumvent. They are often established in locations where they cannot be observed by approaching traffic until it is too late to withdraw and escape without being observed.UN Checkpoint operations Patrol car-equipped police units regularly use random checkpoints to detect drivers who are suspected of impaired driving. Police also use hastily set up roadblocks to check cars and car trunks when they are pursuing an armed and dangerous fugitive. As with military checkpoints, sobriety checkpoints and fugitive roadblock searches are located in an area where drivers cannot see the checkpoint until it is too late to withdraw, and checkpoints are only set up on a temporary basis. Military use U.S. Marines search Iraqi vehicles and their occupants at a Ramadi checkpoint The unit establishing a military checkpoint must carry or obtain the materials necessary to construct it. It might use a large vehicle, or multiple vehicles, such as armored personnel carriers to block the road. In addition to blocking the road with vehicles, the road may also be partially blocked with concertina wire or heavy objects, such as sandbags or concrete blocks. The vehicles might be positioned to partially or entirely block the road or route. The search area might be the space between multiple vehicles. Sentries might be positioned at each end of the checkpoint and are covered by mounted or dismounted machine gun positions. A reaction force may be designated and concealed nearby. Vehicular and pedestrian traffic that approach with the intent of passing flying checkpoints can be asked to produce identification and submit to a search of their persons or vehicle. The trunks of cars are typically searched. In some countries, soldiers inspect the bottom of the car with a mirror to look for bombs. In some cases, people without proper identification or who arouse suspicion may be refused passage, detained, or arrested. Contraband may be confiscated. A random checkpoint must be functional within 15 minutes of the unit's arrival on-site, and establish security teams 50‚Äì100 meters on both sides of the area to be controlled. Advanced observation posts may also be positioned further out if desired.Guide to Military Operations Other Than War: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Stability & Support Operations, Keith Earle Bonn, Anthony E. Baker, pp.113‚Äì115 When large geographical areas need to be monitored, some types of checkpoint may be quickly airlifted by helicopter from one location to another.Afghan Allies Hunt Assassins CNN, July 8, 2002 Flying roadblocks and checkpoints are usually established for no more than a few hours, in order to decrease the possibility of insurgent attacks on them, as well as to maintain their effectiveness as a surprising, unexpected obstacle. Random checkpoints are a common tactic used by many military forces, and have been recently used by UN forces in Kosovo, the Israeli army in the West Bank and US forces in Iraqi Kurdistan, and Iraq in search of insurgents, fugitives, and other law breakers. In some war zones, soldiers working at these checkpoints can be severely injured or killed if one of the vehicles they are searching contains a suicide bomber who detonates his or her bomb or if one of the occupants fires upon soldiers.  Sobriety checkpoints  German Police. Sobriety checkpoints or roadblocks involve law enforcement officials stopping every vehicle (or more typically, every nth vehicle) on a public roadway and investigating the possibility that the driver might be too impaired to drive due to alcohol or drug consumption. They are often set up late at night or in the very early morning hours and on weekends, and on holidays associated with parties (e.g., New Year's Eve) at which time the proportion of impaired drivers tends to be the highest. Checkpoints are also often set near the exit points of public events where people have been drinking to prevent large numbers of drunk drivers from being released into traffic simultaneously from the event. A roadblock stop is quick action spot for police as well as security personnel. With a portable and quick Breathalyzer test, the police can test all drivers (if the law permits) for their breath alcohol content (BrAC), and process the cars one by one as if in a conveyor belt. If a police force does not have these testing devices, a more complicated routine is necessary. Upon suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol, due to the officer noting the smell of alcohol, slurred speech, or other signs, the stopped driver is required to exit the vehicle and asked to take a series of roadside field sobriety tests (FSTs or SFSTs). These tests help the officer to determine whether the person's physical and/or mental skills are impaired. If the officer determines based on his/her observations during the tests that the driver is impaired and has probable cause to arrest the person for suspicion of driving under the influence, the arrestee will be asked to take an alcohol breath test or a blood test. It is important to note that the driver cannot \\"pass\\" or \\"fail\\" a field sobriety test as they are not \\"pass-or-fail\\", they are only meant to aid the officer in determining if a suspect is impaired based on observations of the subject's performance on these tests. There are various guidelines are presented by the various states (US) as well as International rules for these type Sobriety Checkpoints or DUI. For example, in the U.S. Field sobriety tests (FSTs or SFSTs) are voluntary.Law Talk: Should drivers refuse road-side drunk tests?, Michigan Live While the Fourth Amendment (1791) protects people against unreasonable searches and seizures of either self or property by government officials, the use by police of sobriety checkpoints in the US is not prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. Some states such as Washington state have determined that sobriety checkpoints are unconstitutional by State law. Law enforcement often posts or announces in advance that these checkpoints will occur and at what location. Law enforcement agencies often post a sign during the weekdays when it is only seen by local residents and not by those attending a special event or those that only travel in that area of the city during the weekend to patronize local bars and clubs. These announcements are also sometimes printed in newspapers. Numerous websites host a database of checkpoints that are to occur based on information found in newspapers, the Internet and tips from visitors of such sites. In the 2010s, there are smartphone apps that allow users to report sobriety checkpoints, show them on a map and use the device's GPS to alert other drivers when a sobriety checkpoint is nearby. Sobriety checkpoints regularly catch much more than just drunk drivers, as those selected to participate in the checkpoint are asked to provide their driver's licenses. As part of the standard protocol, the person's name and identifying information is run through the National Crime Information Center database, or NCIC, for wants and warrants. If the driver has an outstanding warrant, he/she will likely be arrested. If he/she was driving without a valid license, he/she will likely be cited for driving with a suspended or revoked license. The identity checks could also catch vehicle inspection and registration violations as well. When an individual is stopped for a sobriety check, the officer may also determine that they have probable cause to search the vehicle, which may lead to the officer finding illegal drugs or weapons. =Australia= A Western Australia Police Booze Bus In Australia, drivers may be stopped at any point along any public road by a police officer for what police term a \\"random breath test\\", commonly referred to as an \\"RBT\\".NSW Centre for road safety NSW.gov.au For an operation involving a large number of police (typically 10‚Äì20) at a fixed location, the colloquial term \\"booze bus\\" is often used. In July 1976, legislation allowing Random Breath Testing (RBT) came into force in the State of Victoria, with this being the first State in Australia to introduce such.http://www.icadtsinternational.com/files/documents/1997_126.pdf New South Wales began its own large RBT road safety campaign in 1982. Since then, fatal crashes involving alcohol have dropped from about 40 per cent of all fatalities to the 2012 level of 15 per cent. Police conduct about 5 million breath tests each year in NSW with every police car in the State able to conduct mobile RBT.http://roadsafety.transport.nsw.gov.au/stayingsafe/alcoholdrugs/drinkdriving/rbt/index.html In all states, the maximum blood alcohol content of 0.05% is enforced.Australian Federal Police AFP.gov.au Drivers who are found to have a preliminary reading of equal to or greater than 0.05% are usually arrested and taken to the police station or RBT/\\"booze bus\\" to undertake a breath analysis. The machine used to perform a breath analysis is more sophisticated than the portable device that is used to administer a roadside RBT with the results of a breath analysis being used as evidence in court to prove a drunk driving charge. In all states and territoriesBaldock, M. R. J.; Woolley, J. E. \\"Reviews of the effectiveness of random drug testing in Australia: The absence of crash-based evaluations\\" Centre for Automotive Safety Research, University of Adelaide. Proceedings of the 2013 Australasian Road Safety Research, Policing & Education Conference 28th ‚Äì 30th August, Brisbane, Queensland the concept has been extended to make sobriety checkpoints also use \\"Random Drug Test (RDT) buses\\" (or \\"dual buses\\"), capable of testing drivers for a number of illicit drugs including cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol), methamphetamine, and ecstasy (MDMA).Webster, Natalie. \\"Victoria Police - Full dual bus contingent launched\\". Media release, 7 December 2007. Retrieved 30 December 2017 RBT activities even feature on a popular Australian reality television series known by the same name, RBT (TV series). As of late 2017 the NSW Police Force has announced it is going to expand its mobile drug testing to include cocaine in 2018. Trials of the program will be in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Drunk driving continues to be one of the main causes of road fatalities and injuries, responsible for 30 percent of road fatalities across Australia. =Canada= In Ontario, Canada, sobriety checkpoints are referred to as Reduce Impaired Driving Everywhere, commonly referred to as RIDE. In Alberta and Manitoba they are referred to as Check Stop, and in British Columbia, they are known as Drinking Driving Counterattack. =United States of America= Legality The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that: ‚ÄúThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.‚Äù This fundamental right has a tense relationship with sobriety checkpoints. At a sobriety checkpoint, drivers are necessarily stopped without reasonable suspicion, and may be asked to be tested summarily and without probable cause. Thus the Constitution would prohibit people from being stopped without a search warrant or at least without reasonable suspicion that they have committed a crime; however, the warrant requirement only attaches should the search be unreasonable and the US Supreme Court, as shown below, decided that such stops are not unreasonable under certain circumstances. Driving under the Influence of alcohol, or Drunk Driving, is a special type of crime, as driving with a blood alcohol content (BAC) over a set limit is defined as the crime; it is not necessary to drive recklessly or cause an accident in order to be convicted (although an impaired driver who also drives recklessly could face additional charges). To determine BAC accurately, it is generally necessary for the driver to subject himself to tests that are self incriminating, and drivers sometimes exercise their right against self incrimination to refuse these tests. To discourage this, some jurisdictions set the legal penalties for refusing a BAC test to equal or worse than those for failing a BAC test. In other jurisdictions, the legal system may consider refusing the roadside alcohol breath test to be probable cause, allowing police to arrest the driver and conduct an involuntary BAC test. The Michigan Supreme Court found sobriety roadblocks to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. However, by a 6-3 decision in Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the United States Supreme Court found properly conducted sobriety checkpoints to be constitutional. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, \\"In sum, the balance of the State's interest in preventing drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists who are briefly stopped, weighs in favor of the state program. We therefore hold that it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\\" Dissenting justices argued against this conclusion. Justice Stevens argued that the checkpoints were not reasonably effective, writing that \\"the findings of the trial court, based on an extensive record and affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals, indicate that the net effect of sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is infinitesimal and possibly negative.\\" Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion argued that the police had failed to show that the checkpoint seizures were a necessary tool and worth the intrusion on individual privacy. \\"That stopping every car might make it easier to prevent drunken driving...is an insufficient justification for abandoning the requirement of individualized suspicion,\\" he stated. Jurisdictions that allow sobriety checkpoints often carve out specific exceptions to their normal civil protections, in order to allow sobriety checkpoints. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has found sobriety checkpoints to be constitutionally permissible, ten states (Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) have found that sobriety roadblocks violate their own state constitutions or have outlawed them. One other state (Alaska) does not use checkpoints even though it has not made them illegal. Montana uses checkpoints frequently. Some states combine their efforts in setting up sobriety checkpoint initiatives, such as Checkpoint Strikeforce, jointly run by Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, West Virginia, and Maryland. In California, shortly after a 1984 California Attorney General's Opinion (67 Ops Atty. Gen. 471 (1984, #84-902)), which set out what were intended to be \\"strict guidelines\\" for the legality of drunk driving roadblocks, police departments and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) began using DUI checkpoints to apprehend drunk drivers in the State of California. In Ingersoll v. Palmer (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, the California Supreme Court approved the use of roadblocks so long as they were carried out pursuant to the \\"strict guidelines\\" set forth by the Ingersoll Court and were operated in a manner consistent with the Federal and state Constitutions. Aside for cases of sobriety checkpoints, border security (at points of entry into the United States) and fugitive apprehension, roadblocks or checkpoints for the purpose of general law enforcement are expressly unconstitutional according to City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, \\"Because the checkpoint program's primary purpose is indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control, the checkpoints violate the Fourth Amendment.\\" This prohibits checkpoints erected to interdict narcotics or detect evidence of other illegal activities. However, this does not prevent police departments from attempting these types of checkpoints because they can be a significant source of revenue, particularly near festival periods like college spring break. Many individuals that are apprehended for possession of narcotics at these checkpoints are unlikely to be fully prosecuted on those charges, but the police will collect all fees associated with the arrest before reducing the charges or dismissing them altogether. Because of some inconsistencies between the laws and actual police practice, some individuals maintain that DUI checkpoints are violation of civil rights under the Constitution. Such checkpoints have been the subject of protests, such as individuals holding signs warning drivers \\"Police ahead, turn now.\\" In another instance, a driver protested by placing his license, registration and insurance information inside a plastic baggie inside his car's windshield along with a note reading \\"I remain silent, No searches, I want my lawyer\\". Legal guidelines In approving \\"properly conducted\\" checkpoints, Chief Justice Rehnquist implicitly acknowledged that there must be guidelines in order to avoid having these checkpoints becoming overly intrusive. In other words, checkpoints cannot simply be set up when, where and how police officers choose. As often happens in Supreme Court decisions, however, the Chief Justice left it to the states to determine what those minimal safeguards must be, presumably to be reviewed by the courts on a case- by-case basis. To provide standards for use by the states, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration subsequently issued a report that reviewed recommended checkpoint procedures in keeping with federal and state legal decisions.\\"The Use of Sobriety Checkpoints for Impaired Driving Enforcement\\", DOT HS-807-656, Nov. 1990 An additional source of guidelines can be found in an earlier decision by the California Supreme Court, Ingersoll v. Palmer (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, wherein the California State Supreme Court set forth what it felt to be necessary standards in planning and administering a sobriety checkpoint. The Ingersoll guidelines fall under the following general headings: # Decision making at the supervisory level # Limits on discretion of field officers # Maintenance of safety conditions # Reasonable location # Time and duration # Indicia of official nature of roadblock # Length and nature of detention # Advance publicity A checkpoint in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision of Michigan Dep‚Äôt of State Police v. Sitz (1990) 496 U.S. 444, was decided after Ingersoll. The U.S. Supreme Court did not criticize any of the Ingersoll guidelines, nor did it recommend any others; seemingly making it the law of the land and leaving the decision of whether to permit sobriety checkpoints to the individual states. In People v. Banks (1993) 6 Cal.4th 926, which was decided after Ingersoll and Sitz, and incorporated a discussion of both cases in the opinion, the California State Supreme Court held that advance publicity is not an essential element of the constitutionally of a valid drunk driving roadblock. The Court concluded that although advance publicity remains a factor to consider, the lack of it alone does not render the roadblock unconstitutional. People v. Banks (1993) 6 Cal.4th 926. The following considerations expand upon the general headings listed above: *Decision making must be at a supervisory level, rather than by officers in the field. *A neutral formula must be used to select vehicles to be stopped, such as every vehicle or every third vehicle, rather than leaving it up to the officer in the field. *Primary consideration must be given to public and officer safety. *The site should be selected by policy-making officials, based upon areas having a high incidence of drunk driving. *Limitations on when the checkpoint is to be conducted and for how long, bearing in mind both effectiveness and intrusiveness. *Warning lights and signs should be clearly visible. *Length of detention of motorists should be minimized. *Advance publicity is necessary to reduce the intrusiveness of the checkpoint and increase its deterrent effect. Effectiveness There is a dearth of research regarding the deterrent effect of checkpoints. The only formally documented research regarding deterrence is a survey of Maryland's \\"Checkpoint Strikeforce\\" program. The survey found no deterrent effect: \\"To date, there is no evidence to indicate that this campaign, which involves a number of sobriety checkpoints and media activities to promote these efforts, has had any impact on public perceptions, driver behaviors, or alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes and injuries. This conclusion is drawn after examining statistics for alcohol-related crashes, police citations for impaired driving, and public perceptions of alcohol-impaired driving risk.\\"Beck, Kenneth, 2009. Lessons Learned From Evaluating Maryland's Anti-Drunk Driving Campaign: Assessing the Evidence for Cognitive, Behavioral, and Public Health Impact. Health Promotion Practice, 10: 370-377. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a 2002 Traffic Injury Prevention report, found that in general, the number of alcohol-related crashes was reduced by 20% in states that implement sobriety checkpoints compared to those that do not.contra, see Safety Study - Deterrence of Drunk Driving, The Role of Sobriety Checkpoints and Admin. Lic. Revocations, NTIS PB84-917001, 3-Apr-1984 Public Health Law Research, an independent organization, reported in a 2009 evidence brief summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health, that there is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of selective breath testing sobriety checkpoints as a public health intervention aimed at reducing the harms associated with alcohol impaired driving.Selective Breath Testing Sobriety Checkpoints There is a debate regarding whether saturation patrols or checkpoints are more effective. The FBI did a study comparing saturation patrols vs. checkpoints in Ohio, Missouri, and Tennessee. The study showed that, ‚Äú[o]verall, measured in arrests per hour, a dedicated saturation patrol is the most effective method of apprehending offenders.‚ÄùGreene, Jeffrey W., 2003. Battling DUI: A Comparative Analysis of Checkpoints and Saturation Patrols. FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, 72: 1-6. Another survey found that \\"States with infrequent checkpoints claimed a lack of funding and police resources for not conducting more checkpoints.\\" The survey found that some states \\"...preferred saturation patrols over checkpoints because they were more 'productive'\\", given that \\"... [a] large number of police officers [were used] at checkpoints.\\"Fell, J.C., Ferguson, S.A., Williams, A.F., 2003. Why are sobriety checkpoints not widely adopted as an enforcement strategy in the United States? Accident Analysis and Prevention, 35: 897-902.  Controversy  In May 2015, a Chicago Tribune study found that between 2010 and 2014, a majority of sobriety checks in Chicago were conducted in black and Latino neighborhoods, despite some white neighborhoods ranking among those with the highest number of alcohol-related traffic accidents. Fugitive roadblocks Police also use hastily set up roadblocks to check cars and car trunks when they are pursuing an armed and dangerous fugitive, such as an escaped maximum security prisoner or a suspected armed robber or murderer who is believed to be fleeing from police. Police at such a checkpoint may be armed with shotguns, submachine guns or semiautomatic carbines, in addition to their duty sidearms, depending on the laws and regulations in a jurisdiction. When setting up these types of roadblocks, police in some jurisdiction have the authorization to lay a spike strip across the road, to prevent suspects from trying to drive through the roadblock.

Etymology Zan is an ancient Hungarian personal name, and the original name of the settlement. The diminutive suffix -ka was added later.  History  Z√°nka has been inhabited since Roman times. Its settlement was most likely due to good agricultural conditions. In the 12th century, the first version of what is today the Calvinist church was built in the old village; both the village and its church are mentioned in the chronicles between 1333-1335. A charter from 1519 mentions that the church's patron was Saint Stephen, King of Hungary. During the Ottoman Wars, the village lost a majority of its population, which had been primarily Catholic. When it was repopulated, most of the new inhabitants were Calvinist, resulting in the destroyed church's subsequent reconstruction and use by that denomination, though this later changed; in 1786 both Calvinist and Lutheranian religion used the same church. During the 20th century, the permanent population of the village started to decline due to urbanization. However, the physical town began to grow due to a surge in vacationers. Whereas the old village was located on a hill overlooking the Balaton, and not touching the shore itself, with the construction of vacation homes the village began to stretch down towards the lake-front. A vacationing center for youths was built during the communist regime a few kilometers from the town, mostly used for light indoctrination. In the 21st century, this fell into private hands with the rise of the capitalist regime. Around the same time, a Catholic church in the modern architectural style was built in the village. The Old Church The constructional history of the √Årp√°d dynasty age church was revealed during the renovation and archaeological excavations between 1984-1985. On the basis of the construction and structure the architects estimated the foundation at the 12th century. This is the oldest church of the Balaton region. Its eastern apsis exhibits strong similarities with the construction of apses of the churches of Dejte and Hidegs√©g, where the quadrilateral outer building hides the central inner space. This type of rotunda was widely distributed in Eastern Europe and Middle East. On this strong basement of the eastern apsis the later tower was built both in Z√°nka and at Hidegs√©g. This apsis type can be found in the Pontian region and in Asia Minor, in Egypt and in Syria. Ancient Coptic churches were also built in such style which survived in the architectural art of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). This style also can be found in the western European region (for example Fulda, Saint Michele church). Also a rare character of the church is the robust western tower. The similar types are known from the medieval German architecture, especially in the Brandenburg Mark.  References  * M. Koz√°k √â. (1993): Z√°nka, reform√°tus templom.

With Argentina he played the 1921 and 1921 Copa Am√©rica (then called \\"Campeonato Sudamericano\\"), keeping his goal unbeaten in both occasions. At the end of the Argentina v. Uruguay match for the 1924 South American Championship, Tesoriere was carried aloft by the Uruguayan supporters as a recognition for his outstanding performance during the game.EL D√çA QUE AM√âRICO TESORIERE FUE LLEVADO EN ANDAS POR LOS HINCHAS URUGUAYOS on DeporTV, 2 Nov 2015 The crowd said to President of Uruguay, Jos√© Serrato (who had attended the match): \\"Sir, this man did not allow us to defeat the Argentine team\\".Idolos de la Selecci√≥n: Am√©rico Tesoriere on El Gr√°fico, 30 Apr 2014 Tesoriere in an exhibition, 1974 Tesoriere was also the first footballer to appear on the cover of El Gr√°fico, the most famous sports magazine of Argentina, in July 1922.

The club is a member of the Galway GAA. Salthill-Knocknacarra GAA Club caters for huge numbers of young boys and girls and adults who play Football, Hurling, Ladies Football and Camogie in the parishes of Salthill and Knocknacarra. History The club was founded in 1966 under the banner of Cumann Naomh Ciar√°n. During the 1980s the Club became a major underage force in Galway football under the guidance of Club greats such as Tony Regan and Liam Sammon. This resulted in over ten championships at both minor and U-21 levels being won. This underage success was then transferred onto the Senior stage in 1990 with the Club winning its first Senior football county title followed by a Connaught Club title. The Club lost the All-Ireland Final in 1991 to Lavey of Derry after a spirited effort. Players starring on this team included Alan Mulholland (former Galway Manager), Norman Costello, Cathal McGinley, John Kilraine, Pat Comer (producer of the video \\"A Year Til Sunday\\"), Mark Gibbs, and Donners who subsequently managed the Club to an All Ireland title in 2006. Since the 1980s the Club has always had successful underage teams in football. Minor and U21 finals are regularly contested but the Club did however need to wait under 2005 to win its next County title which was followed by an All Ireland Club title on St Patricks Day in 2006 against St Galls of Antrim, players starring on this team included Finian Hanley, Se√°n Armstrong, Michael Donnellan, Maurice Sheridan, S√©amie Crowe, Alan Kerins to mention only a few. The Club is recognised widely mainly as a football club in Galway with a great reputation for producing strong underage teams. The Club also runs hurling teams which compete at Junior levels and have had their first winning Galway minor in 2009 with Tadhg Haran who starred at midfield at the semi final stage. The club is well structured at under level in all four codes, with many parents involved in managing teams and organising club activities. Players from the club field on underage county teams every year and some club members such as over the years have represented Galway at adult level. Hurling has been played in the club since the early 1980s and for the last four years has experienced growth. Camogie in B√≥thar na Tr√° celebrated 25 years in 2004 and is now stronger than ever. Ladies football has flourished in recent years and the club has won titles at underage and junior level, capturing a Junior county title in 2003, and players are now playing for Galway on the intercounty stage. The club's finest hour came in 2006 when Salthill-Knocknacarra won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship title defeating St. Galls of Antrim in the final. Salthill-Knocknacarra hosted Prince William and Princess Catherine in March 2020, the first visit by any members of the British royal family to a GAA club in Ireland (though previous visitors had toured Croke Park).

Career Percy first became active in politics as a high-school student in 1965, helping organize demonstrations against the Vietnam War. In 1967 he helped to found the Socialist youth organisation Resistance, based on members of the Sydney University Socialist Club and the Vietnam Action Campaign. In 1969, Percy was elected to the initial five-member secretariat of the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign in Sydney. In 1972, he became a founder of the Socialist Workers League. He became the League's Organisation Secretary in 1972 and its National Secretary in 1973. Due to the influence of the US Socialist Workers Party, the SWL later took the name Socialist Workers Party, and Percy continued as secretary. The SWP later became the Democratic Socialist Party. That group now has two descendants, the Democratic Socialist Perspective, a tendency within Socialist Alliance, and the Revolutionary Socialist Party. Percy was central to the DSP becoming an Australia-wide party during the 1970s. In the 1980s, he oversaw a series of attempts by the party to reach out to new forces and to regroup with other far-left organisations.

Heffron and starring Martin Sheen Plot The story takes place in 1958, and involves a town, Clarksberg, with a famous speed trap. Disturbed Sheriff Roy Childress (Vic Morrow), whose wife and daughter were killed by a speeder, turns bad, with a habit of punishing speeders by deliberately pushing their cars off the mountain highway curves with his 1957 Plymouth Belvedere. Two Navy sailors on leave (one portrayed by Sheen's younger brother, Joe Estevez), speeding to get back to base on time in a 1951 Ford Custom, are pushed to their deaths by the sheriff. Soon after, a stranger arrives, driving a hot rodded black 1934 Ford three-window coupe. He provokes Sheriff Childress into giving him a speeding ticket on purpose, establishes his credentials with the sheriff as a hot rodder and potential speed maniac, boasting it can do 75 mph in 10 seconds. He pays the ticket in front of Judge J.A. Hooker (Frederic Downs), and it is revealed he is Michael McCord (Martin Sheen), older brother of one of the sailors. Believing his brother's death was no accident, he does his own investigating, with the help of Maggie (Michelle Phillips). He finds the wreck of his brother's Ford at the impound yard, with the rear bumper dented as if by pushbars. He checks out the lay of the land. Knowing how his brother was killed, he goes out to the Curve, testing its limits and tuning his car to better handle the terrain. Lyle Stafford (Gary Morgan), the younger brother of the town's auto mechanic Buzz Stafford (Nick Nolte) is killed and his girlfriend Sissy (Janit Baldwin) badly injured by the sheriff after the duo go for a drive in a 1955 Mercury. Buzz wants to kill the sheriff for revenge, but McCord says there's another way. Then the sheriff tries to run McCord out of town, and the stage is set for the climactic duel. McCord then runs the speed trap, challenging the sheriff, who tries to run him off the road. McCord is ready, knowing his car's limits for the curve, and the sheriff is a victim of his own obsession, going too fast to make the deadly turn. He drives off the cliff as Buzz and a deputy look on, while McCord slides to a stop on the sandy shoulder.

After a few more records that were moderate successes on the national charts, Ray Steinberg left the group for other interests. As a foursome, The Reflections continued recording and making TV appearances. In 1965, they made their one and only movie appearance in Winter-A-Go-Go, performing \\"I'm Sweet On You\\".

It is found in Indonesia and East Timor. The white-winged triller (L. tricolor) of Australia and New Guinea was formerly included in this species but is now treated as a separate species. It is a fairly small bird, 17 centimetres in length. The bill is grey with a black tip and the legs and feet are black. The male is mainly black above and white below. It has a grey rump, white stripe over the eye, white wing-patches and white on the outer tail-feathers. Females have a similar pattern to the males but are brown instead of black above and have fine black barring on the underparts. The pied triller is similar but is slightly smaller with a broader stripe above the eye and more white in the wing. The male white-winged triller has no white stripe over the eye. The song of the white-shouldered triller is a metallic whistling which is sometimes given in flight. It also utters a rapid series of harsh notes. It occurs in eastern Java, southern Sulawesi, Bali and on the Lesser Sunda Islands. It inhabits open woodland, savannas and agricultural land in dry, lowland areas. It feeds on insects, often swooping down from a perch to catch them on the ground.

Collision  Carrying between 40 and 50 passengers, the Stockton-bound ferry came into a broadside collision with Waraneen and sank half way across the Hunter River shortly after 10:45pm on the night of 9 August 1934. Although it was first thought that all passengers had been saved, it was discovered the following morning that three passengers were still unaccounted for. The ferry had jammed against the side of the freighter for a period of almost a minute before it began to sink. The brief interval allowed sufficient time for six passengers on the upper deck to scramble in to the side of Waraneen, while the remainder jumped headlong into the water. People standing on the Newcastle wharf were unable to discern exactly what was happening in the middle of the harbour, but could hear terrified cries of women and children on board the ferry before it sank, and afterwards as they struggled frantically in the water.  Rescue  The pilot steamer Birubi, which was moving past the scene at the time of the sinking, lowered a boat and picked up two loads of people while others were rescued by the Water Police launch. Fifteen people were treated at the Newcastle Hospital, two were admitted suffering severely from the effects of immersion. The propellers of the steamer Wailhemo, heading out to sea the following morning, churned the water which broke up the wreckage and released the bodies of two women. A third missing woman who was seen on board the ferry by a neighbour was considered the only other victim of the sinking.  Postscript  Later in August 1934 a marine court determined that the ferry pilot was at fault. The rudder of the sunken ferry was recovered by two fishermen in the Hunter River during 1974 and it is now kept in the Newcastle Maritime Museum at Honeysuckle. The last survivor of Bluebell, Mr. Ed Felton, died two-weeks shy of the seventieth-anniversary of the sinking in 2004.

He called his invention the Praxinoscope. Reynaud developed other versions of the Praxinoscope, too, including a Praxinoscope Theatre (where the device was enclosed in a viewing box) and the Projecting Praxinoscope. Eventually he created the \\"Th√©√¢tre Optique\\", a large machine based on the Praxinoscope, but was able to project longer animated strips.

Muybridge successfully photographed a horse in fast motion using a series of 12 cameras controlled by trip wires. Muybridge's photos showed the horse with all four feet off the ground.

Usage  A super-server starts other servers when needed, normally with access to them checked by a TCP wrapper. It uses very few resources when in idle state. This can be ideal for workstations used for local web development, client/server development or low-traffic daemons with occasional usage (such as ident and SSH).  Performance  There is a slight delay in connecting to the sub- daemons. Thus, when compared to standalone servers, a super-server setup may perform worse, especially when under high load. Some servers, such as tftpd- hpa, therefore take over the internet socket and listen on it themselves for some specified interval, anticipating more connections to come.

Career He worked as a Royal Hong Kong Police Force police inspector before entering the entertainment industry. His most memorable moment as a police inspector was during a press conference he held with members of Hong Kong's press at the scene of the 1974 Po Sang Bank robbery, which was one of the biggest bank robbery cases up until then in Hong Kong history. He resigned as a Superintendent of Police in 1976 to join Bang Bang Films as a Producer and simultaneously headed its Advertising Department, marketing the then very popular jeans and apparel brand-name in Hong Kong. Chan first made his popularity in the then British Colony of Hong Kong by being the lead vocalist for the first all-Chinese college pop group, \\"The Astro-Notes\\" (taken after the Astronauts representing the US and the Sputniks representing the USSR during the space race in the early 60s. He became a household name when he joined the Royal Hong Kong Police in 1965 by displaying courage and leadership in solving several sensational, major crime cases in the British Colony, including the first ever armed bank robbery in 1974 in which 11 hostages were held at ransom. He was nicknamed the \\"Singing Inspector\\" when he wrote the lyrics and went on TV to promote road safety for school children. His success in police work earned him a quick promotion to Superintendent of Police in 1975. In 1976, he was invited by actress Josephine Siu (Siu Fong Fong) and director Pochi Leung to write a police screenplay involving heroin trafficking between Amsterdam and Hong Kong, \\"Jumping Ash\\". The upbeat detective movie hit an instant box-office success in 1976, grossing one million dollars in three days and caused the young policeman to consider pursuing his greatest love of his life, films and music. . He resigned from public service to head the film production department and marketing department for Bang Bang Group, which was then the most successful jeans company in Hong Kong. He also took the helm in producing two popular youth programs on Hong Kong Television Broadcasting Limited and the then Rediffusion Television respectively to promote Bang Bang Fashion.

Although he was accepted to Takushoku University, where he studied the Chinese language, in 1942 he left without graduating and illegally migrated to Manchukuo to escape the wartime food shortages in Japan. He was conscripted into the military intelligence section of the Imperial Japanese Army‚Äôs Eighth Combined Division in 1945, and after the Soviet invasion of Manchuria was captured and sent to Siberia as a prisoner of war by the Soviet Red Army. He was returned to Japan in 1947 and graduated from college. In 1949, he completed writing an account of his experiences in the Siberian internment camps, and worked at a number of part-time jobs, including a stint as a scenario writer for Toei Studios. In 1953, he obtained at the Japanese government broadcasting company, NHK, as a producer of radio programs, and continued to write on the side. His first novel Soshi futatabi kaerazu (\\"The Desperado Does Not Return\\"), published under his actual name, was awarded a prize in 1955 for best work by a new author. He set aside all of the earnings from his writing, and used to fund a round-the-world trip from 1958-1967, mostly on a 50-cc Honda Super Cub. On his return to Japan, he adopted the Kurumizawa K≈çshi pen-name, and began to write adventure novels. In 1981 and in 1982, he was recommended for the Naoki Prize for novels based on his travels.

She expresses herself, both to her surroundings and in short spurts of spoken monologue, warning away animals and expressing the pain she feels in her weary bones. Plot \\"A Worn Path\\" is told in the third person point of view. In which \\"A Worn Path\\" follows an elderly African American woman named Phoenix Jackson as she ventures toward a town. The story is set in \\"Natchez, Mississippi\\" during the Great Depression era. As Phoenix journeys along the Natchez Trace, she periodically encounters many obstacles, including thorny bushes, barbed wire, and a large dog, among others. She meets a hunter, pocketing a nickel that he drops, and a lady who ties her shoes. The story concludes with Phoenix arriving at the town having completed the journey yet again. Her motivation for having done so is also revealed as she laments how her grandson swallowed lye damaging his throat from the reaction. She tells the nurse supplying the medicine that the damage to his throat never fully heals, and every so often his throat will begin to swell shut. It is Old Phoenix's love for her grandson that causes her to face the trial of the journey to town, every time it is necessary, with no questions asked.  Character  The character of Phoenix Jackson is an elderly African American woman who uses a thin small cane made from an umbrella to tap the ground, akin to a white cane. Elaine Orr identifies Phoenix as a fabulist who has \\"a penchant for re-creation (making up stories) rather than resolution.\\" She has also been identified as \\"a completely and beautifully harmonious person\\" and Nancy K. Butterworth has noted that the character is neither a stereotype or stock character.  Themes  A commonly cited theme of the story is unselfish love, which Orr has stated is the \\"\\"charitable\\" view of Phoenix that the white community in the text finds acceptable\\". The short story also discusses racism and the arrogance it breeds by marginalising other people and being cruel to them. However, another theme of the story is the ability of the human spirit to endure conflict and poor circumstances within nature and society out of devotion to loved ones. Symbolism The symbolism in the piece and the potential lessons to be learned from it are open to interpretation. Many critics have commented on the significance of the main character's name in relation to the mythology phoenix, relating to her indomitable ability to rise again and make her journey. Other writers such as Dennis Sykes and Kevin Moberly have argued that Phoenix's endurance through multiple obstacles emphasizes racial and economic inequalities in the Deep South during the Depression. Kathleen Feeley has drawn comparisons to the story of Odysseus, who faces many trials along his journey. Welty herself has said it is a story about how a writer works. Mistletoe is seen as a symbolic item by David Piwinski, who states that the plant is affiliated with \\"Jesus Christ\\" implying how Phoenix herself Is a \\"Christ-like figure\\" who repeatedly overcomes adversity. Similarly, Piwinski notes how mistletoe is specifically an \\"evergreen\\" which may \\"allude to the idea that (Phoenix) is an immortal figure\\". Orr states that the cycle culminates for Phoenix herself in the form of the lye/damage/obstacles representing the death that the cycle begins with while the journey and destination relate to the subsequent rebirth and that the money has meaning behind it with the nickel that she stole from the ground that the hunter dropped, can say that she find and takes what she needs when she needs it.

Although innovative, the tip-rotor concept literally failed to get off the ground in the P.74, doomed by its inadequate power source. Rather than being modified, the P.74 was towed off the airfield and scrapped.Winchester 2005, p. 230. Design and development In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company formed a helicopter division, and began design work on a medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an experimental helicopter to test jet driven rotors. This experimental helicopter had a teardrop-shaped fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran the full length of the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx gas generators fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a screw jack. The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers. The lack of a gearbox and the simplified rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed in the form of lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent engine powered rotor. The stainless- steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades. The P.74 prototype (designated the Hunting Percival P.74 after the company change its name in 1954) was completed in the spring of 1956, and given the military serial number XK889. The final product looked decidedly ungainly, with a large bulbous fuselage that tapered to a tiny \\"tailcone\\" with an equally tiny tail rotor (deemed sufficient for control since there was no torque from the tip-rotors). The undercarriage consisted of four wheels on splayed-out stubs with castoring for the front two wheels. The large capacity of the P.74 was to show the possible commercial aspect.Flight 1955 A larger commercial variant, the 10-passenger Percival P.105, with stub wing mounted engines either side of the rotor mast was envisaged, and the P.74 was expected to offer information into the necessary ducting required hence the engine was mounted underneath the fuselage with ducts running up through the cabin. Testing and evaluation Hunting Percival P.74 c. 1956 Ground testing in a static rig commenced in 1956, but the Oryx engines failed to develop full power and maximum gas flow. Even with modifications to the power units, the first flight was aborted when the P.74 failed to fly. This may have been providential as there were no escape provisions for the two pilots.Winchester 2005, p. 231. The only entrance door was located at the rear on the port side. The primary test pilot was famously quoted as saying the hapless P.74 had, \\"...the cockpit, flying controls and engine controls... designed without any input from a pilot.\\"Winchester 2005, p. 231. The designers planned to fit a more powerful Rolls-Royce RB108 turbine, and a further development of a 10-passenger (P.105) variant was on the \\"drawing boards\\" when the nationalisation of the helicopter industry later that year resulted in the P.74 project being cancelled and the prototype scrapped.

She participated in the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America in New York City in 1892. She assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino-Japanese War and remained in the Pacific until late 1896, when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt. She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 and had a lengthy refit, which replaced all of her machinery, before returning to the Mediterranean in 1901. Returning to the Baltic during the Russo-Japanese War Imperator Nikolai I was refitted in late 1904 to serve as the flagship of the Third Pacific Squadron under Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. She was slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima and was surrendered, along with most of the Third Pacific Squadron, by Admiral Nebogatov to the Japanese the following day. She was taken into the Imperial Japanese Navy under the new name of and she served as a gunnery training ship until 1910 and then became a first-class coast defense ship and training vessel. She was sunk as a target ship in October 1915. Development Imperator Nikolai I was originally intended as a smaller ship than her half- sister along the lines of the Brazilian battleship , but armed with guns. A contract was signed on 6 November 1885 with the Baltic Works for a ship armed with two 12-inch guns in a forward barbette. However, this was quickly cancelled and a contract was quickly let with the Franco-Russian Works for a repeat of Imperator Aleksandr II even though the earlier ship had been built by the Baltic Works. The Franco-Russian Works had difficulties getting the drawings and was forced to redraft some of them. They took the opportunity to change the design in a number of relatively minor ways while doing so. However, the substitution of a gun turret for Imperator Aleksandr IIs barbette mount was made in 1887, well after the start of construction and proved problematic. The design of the turret was not finalized until April 1889 and work on the forward part of the hull had to cease for more than six months because the dimensions of the turret were not yet known. The turret proved to be heavier than the older ship's barbette and made Imperator Nikolai I slightly bow-heavy despite a reduction in the height of the belt armor in compensation.McLaughlin, pp. 40‚Äì41 Description Imperator Nikolai I was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of , more than designed. She displaced at load, over more than her designed displacement of .McLaughlin, p. 39 Imperator Nikolai I's forward turret and bridge shortly after Tsushima Imperator Nikolai I had two triple-cylinder vertical compound steam engines, each driving a single propeller. Twelve cylindrical boilers provided non-superheated steam to the engines. They were built by Baltic Works and had a total designed output of . On trials, the powerplant produced a total of , and a top speed of . She carried of coal that gave her a range of at a speed of .McLaughlin, pp. 39, 43‚Äì44 The main armament of the Imperator Aleksandr II-class ships was a pair of Obukhov Model 1877 30-caliber guns. Imperator Nikolai I carried hers in a twin-gun turret forward. The four Obukhov Model 1877 35-caliber guns were on center-pivot mounts in casemates at the corners of the citadel, the hull given a pronounced tumblehome to increase their arcs of fire ahead and behind. The eight Model 1877 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts. Four were fitted between the 9-inch guns and could traverse a total of 100¬∞. The others were mounted at each end of the ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern. The ten Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship, between the nine and six-inch guns to defend against torpedo boats. Four Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in each fighting top. Imperator Nikolai I carried six above-water torpedo tubes. One was in the bow, two tubes were on each broadside and a tube was in the stern.McLaughlin, p. 42 Most of Imperator Nikolai Is armor was imported from the United Kingdom and some deliveries were delayed which caused problems during construction. The height of the waterline armor belt was reduced in comparison to that of her half- sister, being tall, of which was above the designed waterline and below. Most of the rest of the protection matched that of Imperator Aleksandr II other than the waterline belt forward which only reduced to a minimum of six inches rather than the of the older ship and the walls of the conning tower were only six inches thick, less than her half-sister.McLaughlin, pp. 42‚Äì43 History Captain Richard Romanovich Dicker (1847‚Äì1939). Imperator Nikolai I was named after the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She was built by the Franco-Russian Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 4 August 1886, launched on 1 June 1889, and completed in July 1891, although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892. She sailed in June 1892 for New York City to participate in the celebration honoring the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Upon her departure she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 with the Russian Squadron to reinforce the Franco- Russian Alliance. She was then commanded by Captain Richard Dicker.L'Illustration, n¬∞ 2642, October 14, 1893. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino-Japanese War and arrived at Nagasaki, Japan on 28 April 1895, before sailing for Chefoo in China. She remained in the Pacific until late 1896, when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron. While there, she operated as part of the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897‚Äì1898 Greek Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire‚Ä≤s rule in Crete,McLaughlin, pp. 39, 44 and on 14 February 1897 she evacuated the island‚Ä≤s Ottoman vali (governor), George Berovich (also known as Berovich Pasha); she transported him to Trieste.McTiernan, p. 15.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: Know your enemy ‚Äì part 1 She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 for an extensive, multi-year, refit. Her machinery was replaced with Belleville water-tube boilers and vertical triple expansion steam engines. Her after superstructure was cut down one deck abaft the mainmast and most of her 47 mm and 37 mm revolving cannon were removed. Only two 37 mm revolvers were retained and she received sixteen 47 mm and two 37 mm single-barreled guns in their place.McLaughlin, p. 157 Yokosuka, 12 February 1906 Imperator Nikolai I returned to the Mediterranean in September 1901 and remained there until the Russo-Japanese War when she was transferred to the Baltic to be refitted in late 1904 to serve as the flagship of the Third Pacific Squadron under Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. The squadron departed LiepƒÅja on 15 January 1905 for the Pacific. She was slightly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima, receiving one hit from a twelve-inch gun, two from eight-inch guns and two from six-inch guns, and suffered only 5 killed and 35 men wounded. She was surrendered, along with most of the Third Pacific Squadron, by Admiral Nebogatov the following day. Japanese service On 6 June 1905, she was taken into the Imperial Japanese Navy and renamed Iki, after Iki Island in the Sea of Japan, near the site of the Battle of Tsushima. She served as a gunnery training ship until 12 December 1910 when she was redesignated as a first-class coast defense ship and a training vessel.McLaughlin, pp. 44‚Äì45 As Iki she was armed with her original 12-inch/30 caliber guns in a forward twin turret, six 6-inch/40 caliber Armstrong Pattern Z guns in single mounts, six 4.7-inch/40 caliber Armstrong Pattern T guns in single mounts, six 3-inch/40 caliber Armstrong N guns in single mounts and six 18-inch torpedoes. She was stricken 1 May 1915 and sunk as a target by the battlecruisers and , although Watts and Gordon say that she was scrapped in 1922.

He served as the minister between 1979 and 1986. Teh was investigated for corruption in November 1986 and was found dead on 14 December 1986. Early life Teh's early education began at Lai Teck School and later at Chung Ling High School, Penang. He studied architecture at the University of Sydney in Australia, graduating in 1956. Teh's early career was as an architect at PWD, New South Wales, Australia. He then moved to the Housing Commission in New South Wales before expanding his expertise with the Housing Trust in Kuala Lumpur and serving in the Penang City Council. In August 1959, he joined the Singapore Improvement Trust as an architect. He was promoted to Chief Architect, Building Department of the newly formed Housing and Development Board (HDB) in October 1959. Later he became the Chief Executive Officer of HDB from 1970 to January 1979. He was also the Chairman of Jurong Town Corporation between September 1976 to March 1979. He resigned from his posts to go into politics. Teh was elected as a Member of Parliament for Geylang West constituency in January 1979, and held the seat till December 1986. He was also appointed as the Minister for National Development on 1 February 1979 and held his position. As Minister for National Development, Teh proposed a ban on chewing gum in 1983 in light of public cleanliness issues.Lee Kuan Yew (2000). From Third World to First: The Singapore Story. Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew rejected the idea as being too drastic, but 9 years after Teh's initial proposal, a chewing gum ban was passed into law. Corruption charges Teh was investigated for corruption by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau for accepting two bribes of $400,000 each in 1981 and 1982. Then Minister for National Development, he had allegedly accepted bribes totaling $1 million from 2 private companies for helping them retain and buy over a piece of state land for private development. In November 1986, the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, approved an open investigation on his alleged corruption, however, the papers were issued to the Attorney-General on December 11. Though Teh maintained his innocence, he committed suicide before being charged for the offences, on December 14. In his suicide note, Teh wrote:Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew [1992] SGCA 27 at [4]. As a result of the suicide, the Attorney-General could not proceed with the charges, although Lee Kuan Yew responded with a condolence letter after ascertaining the cause of his death with Ministry of Health. The letter recognized his role to help modernized construction industry and speed- up the building of expressways and lessened traffic jams. On 26 Jan 1987, Lee Kuan Yew delivered a parliamentary speech by reading out the suicide note addressed to him, written by Teh. He then revealed for the first time that Teh was being investigated for accepting bribes. Lee stressed that \\"there is no way a Minister can avoid investigations, and a trial if there is evidence to support one.\\" Later in the book titled \\"Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas\\", published in 1998, Lee reiterated the importance of having a system where people act in accordance with certain principles. > \\"The purpose is not just to be righteous. The purpose is to create a system > which will carry on because it has not been compromised. I didn't do that > just to be righteous about Teh Cheang Wan. But if I had compromised, that is > the end of the system.\\" However, there was a subsequent investigation into the matter as a result of allegation of Chiam See Tong, the opposition MP, that there were unanswered questions into the whole episode. On 20 January 1987, the State Coroner returned a verdict of suicide due to an overdose of amytal barbiturate.

It is the burial place of Nakht, an ancient Egyptian official who held the position of a scribe and astronomer of Amun, probably during the reign of Thutmose IV (1401 BC ‚Äì 1391 BC or 1397 BC ‚Äì 1388 BC) during the Eighteenth Dynasty, the first dynasty of the New Kingdom. Architecture Plan of the Tomb The tomb architecture and decoration conforms to the standard design of Theban tombs of the New Kingdom by using such scenes that are commonly found in contemporary tombs. Some of these decorations display differences from scenes found in Old Kingdom mastabas of Memphis, where one of the principal functions of the tomb was to ensure magical sustenance for the ka, whereas in the New Kingdom tombs, the primary function was to identify oneself on the tomb walls. The tomb has the typical T-shaped architectural design that was common for non-royal Theban tombs of the New Kingdom; there was a broad hall, which followed from the entrance and court. This led into an inner chamber, the long hall, and the shrine, which was situated in a niche, containing the statue of the deceased. These chambers were designed to contain scenes for the service of the dead in their afterlife. Essentially, this architectural design is somewhat similar to that of the bipartite mastabas of the Old Kingdom, which contained two main chambers, the offering chapel and the burial chamber, as these New Kingdom tombs also contain two main chambers. However, in the latter tombs both of the chambers are created for different purposes to that of the chambers within the Old Kingdom mastabas. Within the mastaba, the offering chapel was dedicated to the sustenance of the deceased beyond death by magically providing food and water. Such scenes are generally not depicted as often in the New Kingdom tombs. Decoration Illusory door The stela on the south wall of the broad hall shows men making offerings to images of the deceased. Beneath this, Nut is shown before a pile of offerings. This scene, therefore, shows that the dead were not wholly reliant on their family for offerings but could rely on \\"a divine source as well\\".Norman de Garis Davies, The Tomb of Nakht at Thebes, Robb de Peyster Tytus Memorial Series, Volume 1, Publications of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1917 Similar scenes could also be found on the walls of Old Kingdom burials, depicting processions of people bringing offerings for the deceased. However, Malek wrote that offerings scenes are rarer in New Kingdom tombs than in the Old Kingdom.Malek, Jaromir: Egyptian Art, Phaidon Press Limited, New York, 1999, reprinted 2002, pp 240, 243 Two corresponding scenes are depicted on the east wall next to the entrance to the broad hall. These scenes show Nakht and his wife, Tawy, making offerings to Ra, who is manifested by the sunlight that would emerge from the doorway. This scene is depicted to show the continuation of an earthly ritual in the afterlife ‚Äì in the New Kingdom private individuals had access to an afterlife meaning that they could expect to enter the Field of Reeds. Agriculture scenes A scene on the south side of the west wall represents a banquet scene. This genre of scene is frequently represented in New Kingdom tombs. The family of the deceased, in this case Nakht and Tawy, is also shown together being entertained by the musicians and dancers. Malek wrote \\"domestic scenes are frequent\\" because they emphasise the closeness of the family and their continued existence together in the afterlife. However, these scenes may also have a sexual or potent purpose for the afterlife. MannichManniche, Lise: The so-called scenes of daily life in the private tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty from Strudwick, Nigel and Taylor, John, The Theban Necropolis: Past Present and Future, The British Museum Press, London, 2002 wrote that by including such scenes in the tomb, the deceased could be guaranteed potency in the hereafter. She writes that banquet scenes \\"are littered with such references\\" including the inclusion of mandrakes and lotus flowers, which are being held by the women in the second register. These type of scenes were highly common in New Kingdom Theban tombs. On the south side of the east wall, there is an agricultural scene. Nakht is shown overseeing men who are ploughing, sowing and harvesting the fields. The scenes of agriculture may show the continuation of Nakht‚Äôs life in the Field of Reeds. However, as suggested by Noblecourt, these scenes may metaphorically show an eternal life through the process of farming, through the seasons. If Noblecourt‚Äôs view is accurate, then the scenes are different from that of Old Kingdom mastabas, where any agricultural scenes were designed primarily as a means of magically ensuring the continuity of farming on the estates of the deceased, thereby allowing sustenance for their ka. Nakht while hunting and fishing On the north side of the west wall, Nakht is shown in a further frequently depicted scene: the fishing and fowling scene. This type of scene is also commonly found in New Kingdom, and although they were not uncommon in Old Kingdom mastabas, within the latter their primary purpose was to provide magical sustenance for the dead. In the tomb of Nakht, he is shown spearing fish and fowl, together with his family. Davies (1917:66) suggests that \\"sustenance‚Ä¶was not always coaxed from the soil by severe labor [sic]\\", indicating that this scene was used to show a form of receiving food after death in a different way, for entertainment for the deceased and for an artistic change of genre. However, there is a different interpretation that they were, like banquet scenes, depicted to show an image of potency and creativity after death as some of the equipment is similar and \\"the women present‚Ä¶wear outfits similar to that worn for a banquet\\". Davies writes that all of these scenes may have had a further important motif in showing the family of the deceased together. He wrote that the Egyptians enjoyed family life and \\"the strength with which love of family survived death is witnessed to by the family groups painted on nearly every wall\\", suggesting that one purpose of the tomb scenes was to guarantee their company beyond death. The architecture and decoration display much evidence for the thought of the Egyptians regarding their afterlife. As the tomb was split into two chambers, it can be said that they regarded their death in two parts, their afterlife and the transition phase between death and the afterlife, the latter not being depicted in the Tomb of Nakht. The decoration shows that, in contrast to Old Kingdom beliefs, as depicted of the walls of Memphite mastabas, its most important function was depict a life after death, together with family, with indications of creativity and potency, and \\"thus the picture of Theban life in a tomb of the Eighteenth Dynasty is a clear mirror of existence‚Ä¶of the homesteads around it where the nature-loving Egyptian preferred to dwell\\".

She is an AIGA Medalist and principal of Green Dragon Office, a design firm that focuses on collaborative work with artists, architects, curators, editors and publishers. Wild is based in Los Angeles, California.  Early life and education  In 1973, Wild entered the Cranbrook Academy of Art program which was, at the time, under the leadership of Michael and Katherine McCoy. In 1975, she received her B.F.A. degree in Graphic Design. Two years later, she moved to New York to work for Vignelli Associates from 1977‚Äì1978. During this time, she was researching the history of American graphic design post World War II. This personal interest of research led her to further studying at Yale University where she earned an M.F.A. degree in 1982. While at Yale University, she designed Perspecta 19, which was Yale's architectural journal. Along with Perspecta 19, she also designed the Chamber Works and Theatrum Mundi portfolios for the architect Daniel Libeskind, and the book of architect John Hejduk entitled Mask of Medusa in 1985. Her work on the designs of these books helped launch her fast- growing reputation for thoughtful and distinctive design in books on architecture, art, and design. Her MFA thesis entitled \\"Trends in American Graphic Design: 1930-1955\\" was recognized as an important contribution to design scholarship and led to many commissions for essays. From here on, her reputation continued to soar and her work earned national recognition. Design career in the 1980s While teaching in the University of Houston's architecture school during the early 1980s, Wild wrote the influential essay \\"More Than A Few Questions about Graphic Design Education\\" (1983), first published in The Design Journal. In the article, she gives a provocative analysis which became the driving force for recharacterizing graphic design education in the United States. This led to her being hired as graphic design program director at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia in 1985. During her time as director, she developed and implemented a new model for graphic design education that emphasized the process of conveying meaning through experimental, conceptual, and formal development. The program challenged modernist graphic design methodology by encouraging students to use personal and emotional experiences to their work. In 1988, Liz McQuiston selected Lorraine Wild as one of forty-three women in six countries whose work is innovative or has had significant impact in their chosen fields of design. The other American graphic designers included Jacqueline Casey, Muriel Cooper, June Fraser, April Greiman, Katherine McCoy.American Graphic Design: A Guide to Literature Compiled by Ellen Mazur Thomson. 1992 She continued to stay on the Cal Arts faculty after she stepped down as program director in 1991. Design career in the 1990s From 1991-1998, she served as project tutor at the Jan van Eyck Akademie in Maastricht, Netherlands. Lorraine Wild was one of the founders of the design office ReVerb, which was the recipient of the 1995 Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design. She left ReVerb in 1996 to start her own company- Lorraine Wild Design. As a side project, she partnered with Roman Alonso and Lisa Eisner in 1999 to establish Greybull Press. Greybull Press was an imprint specializing in the publication of photographic archives and collections that were considered potentially influential to tastemakers. Lorraine Wild Design was later renamed the Green Dragon Office in 2004. The Green Dragon Office focused on collaborations with architects, artists, curators, and publishers in the United States and abroad and has designed catalogs for exhibitions at museums including MOCA, UCLA's Hammer Museum, the Getty Center, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In 1998, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art held the exhibition \\"Lorraine Wild: Selections from the Permanent Collection,\\" a display of work that the Museum regards as their collection of significant design produced in California. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Wild sporadically contributed to Emigre, publishing a variety of critical essays such as the influential \\"That was Then, and This is Now: But What is Next?\\". Design career in the millennium In 2005, she became a regular contributor to Design Observer, the leading website on design commentary and criticism. She has also served on the National Board of the AIGA and on the design advisory board for the international Design Conference at Aspen, Colorado. She loves the works of designers W.A. Dwiggins, who reinvented American typography by bringing arts- and-crafts values to design for machine production; Alvin Lustig, an architect, printer, educator, who refused to specialize; Imre Reiner, an anti- Modernist typographer in Switzerland who rebelled against \\"objectivity\\"; Sister Corita Kent, a Southern California nun and printmaker who, in the 1960s, seized upon the idea of using the language of pop culture to speak to her local audience about spirituality, subverting, and appropriating to communicate; and Edward Fella, who mutated out of \\"commercial art\\" by working on problems only as he defined them and his commitment to anti- mastery.Armstrong, Helen. Graphic Design Theory: Readings From the Field. New York, NY, USA:Princeton Architectural Press, 2009. p.86 \\"Her thoroughly informed and deeply sympathetic understanding of the nature of art and design has brought her commissions for monographs on artists and architects as far- ranging as Mike Kelley and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, as well as books and exhibition catalogues for institutions such as Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, The Getty Museum, UCLA's Hammer Museum, and the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montr√©al.\\" Her visual work has been formed around a passion for typographic detail and formal invention and analysis. On September 14, 2010, she wrote a very informative and critical article in the Design Observatory Group website entitled \\"The Black Rule\\". According to Wild, the Black Rule is \\"intimately connected to a typographic grid, and the paper it's printed on.\\" The color black symbolizes importance and, in the case of The Black Rule, formality. The Black Rule also defines the dimensions of a piece of paper and separates the hierarchy of heads and subheads. The text that is used for The Black Rule is, commonly, Helvetica. This is evident in our every day life whether we notice it or not is the question. The most noticeable signs of The Black Rule is on subway signs or on U.S. Park Service maps. Wild was not the founder or inventor of The Black Rule. Massimo Vignelli is credited for discovering The Black Rule. This became his own brand although it was not typical, at the time, for designers to have a certain icon to represent his or her own work. Vignelli's most popular works is designing the American Airlines logo and the iconic New York City Subway maps. Awards Lorraine Wild was one of forty-three women in six countries whose work was selected by Liz McQuiston as innovative or had significant impact in their chosen fields of design.McQuiston, Liz. Women in Design: A Contemporary View. New York: Rizzoli, 1988. She was one of three finalists for the 2001 Communication Award of the National Design Awards sponsored by the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. She was awarded a Gold Medal by the New York Art Director's Club for the design of Height of Fashion. She has received a great number of awards from prestigious organizations such as the American Center for Design, the American Institute of Graphic Arts' (AIGA) highly selective \\"50 Best Books of the Year,\\" the American Institute of Architects and the American Association of University Publishers. Her writing has appeared in many periodicals and books that include √âmigr√©, ID, Print, Graphic Design in America, Cranbrook Design: The New Discourse, Lift & Separate, Looking Closer, and The Education of a GraphicDesigner. Wild was the recipient of a 2006 AIGA medal. The medal of AIGA‚Äîthe most distinguished in the field‚Äîis awarded to individuals in recognition of their exceptional achievements, services or other contributions to the field of design and visual communication. Current She is currently the principal of Green Dragon Office in Los Angeles, a design firm that focuses on collaborative work with artists, architects, curators, editors and publishers which has been active since 1996; she is also the creative director of design at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Wild continues to be associated with the design program at the California Institute of the Arts. She is also a partner (along with Kristine McKenna and Donna Wingate) in Foggy Notion Books. Past collaborations include a partnership with Louise Sandhaus and Rick Valicenti in Wild LuV, and a co-editorship with Roman Alonso and Lisa Eisher in Greybull Press of Los Angeles.

Traceability as a general term is defined by the IEEE Systems and Software Engineering Vocabulary as (1) the degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more products of the development process, especially products having a predecessor- successor or master-subordinate relationship to one another; (2) the identification and documentation of derivation paths (upward) and allocation or flowdown paths (downward) of work products in the work product hierarchy; (3) the degree to which each element in a software development product establishes its reason for existing; and (4) discernible association among two or more logical entities, such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or tasks. Requirements traceability in particular, is defined as \\"the ability to describe and follow the life of a requirement in both a forwards and backwards direction (i.e., from its origins, through its development and specification, to its subsequent deployment and use, and through periods of ongoing refinement and iteration in any of these phases)\\". In the requirements engineering field, traceability is about understanding how high-level requirements ‚Äì objectives, goals, aims, aspirations, expectations, needs ‚Äì are transformed into low-level requirements. It is therefore primarily concerned with satisfaction relationships between layers of information (aka artifacts). However, traceability may document relationships between many kinds of development artifacts, such as requirements, specification statements, designs, tests, models and developed components.Pinheiro F.A.C. and Goguen J.A., \\"An object-oriented tool for tracing requirements\\", IEEE Software 1996, 13(2), pp. 52-64 For example, it is common practice to capture verification relationships to demonstrate that a requirement is verified by a certain test artifact. Traceability is especially relevant when developing safety-critical systems and therefore prescribed by safety guidelines, such as DO178C, ISO 26262, and IEC61508. A common requirement of these guidelines is that critical requirements must be verified and that this verification must be demonstrated through traceability.  Tracing towards and beyond the requirements  Pre-requirements traceability. Requirements come from different sources, like the business person ordering the product, the marketing manager and the actual user. These people all have different requirements of the product. Using requirements traceability, an implemented feature can be traced back to the person or group that wanted it during the requirements elicitation. This can be used during the development process to prioritize the requirement, determining how valuable the requirement is to a specific user. It can also be used after the deployment to see why certain unused features found during user studies were required in the first place. Post-requirements traceability. Not only the requirements themselves should be traced but also the requirements relationship with all the artifacts associated with it, such as models, analysis results, test cases, test procedures, test results and documentation of all kinds. Even people and user groups associated with requirements should be traceable. Requirements are realized into design artifacts, implementation, and finally, verified. Artifacts tied to the latter stages should be traced back to the requirements as well. This is typically done via a requirements traceability matrix. Establishing traceability beyond requirements into design, implementation, and verification artifacts can become difficult. When implementing software requirements for instance, the requirements may be in a requirements management tool, while the design artifacts may be in a tool such as MagicDraw, Mathworks Simulink, Rational Rhapsody, and Microsoft Visio. Furthermore, implementation artifacts will likely be in the form of source files, links to which can be established in various ways at various scopes. Verification artifacts such as those generated by internal tests or formal verification tools (e.g., LDRA Testbed suite, Parasoft DTP, and SCADE) Repository or tool stack integration can present a significant challenge to maintaining traceability in a dynamic system.  Usage of traceability information  The usage of traceability, especially when tracing beyond requirements to all artifacts located in the tool chain, can bring several benefits: * Change impact analysis ‚Äì if a requirement is changing, trace links inform about related and dependent artifacts. These artifacts can easily be verified and if required be adjusted. The probability to overlook related artifacts is reduced. * Coverage analysis ‚Äì traceability ensures that no requirements are overlooked. Especially when certifying safety-critical products it is necessary to demonstrate that all requirements are realized. * Project status analysis ‚Äì tracking of the project status is possible: analyzing the traceability data allows seeing the completion status of the requirements. Requirements without links or with incomplete trace chain (e.g. requirements with implementation but without tests) indicate that further work is necessary. The missing links show which concrete artifacts are missing and need to be realized. * Reuse of product components ‚Äì it is possible to structure requirements and their linked artifacts in packages. These packages can be used for different products. * Persisting relationships ‚Äì often knowledge of a project or product is in the head of specific persons. By use of traceability this knowledge is saved by visualizing the relation between the different artifacts. This knowledge remains even if a person leaves the project. * Test optimization ‚Äì by linking requirements, source code, test cases and test results it is easy to identify affected parts of the source code if tests fail. Furthermore, redundant test cases can be identified and eliminated. A more complete overview of development activities supported by traceability and their relevance is given in.  Practical use of traceability information  Extensive studies document the effectiveness, but also the difficulties of capturing traceability information: * Traceability accelerates and improves development activities - A study with 71 subjects who performed source code changes with and without traceability support showed benefits of traceability. Developers completed tasks with traceability support 24% faster and 50% more correct. * More complete traceability helps avoid software defects - In an analysis of development data from 24 medium-sized and large open-source projects, a statistically significant relationship between the completeness of the captured traceability information and the defect rate of the developed source code was found. Components with more complete traceability showed a lower number of defects (aka bugs). * Achieving compliant traceability is difficult - An analysis of the pre-market testing of software in medical devices at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 identified significant gaps between prescribed and filed traceability information. The quest towards a standard-conformable traceability often results in a \\"Big Freeze\\". Big freeze, since companies aim to avoid further development because re-certification is associated with enormous effort.  Visualization of traceability information  One goal of traceability is to visualize the relationship between artifacts. As the number and complexity of trace links increases, techniques for traceability visualization are necessary. A visualization can include information about the artifacts (e.g. artifact type, metadata, attributes) and links (e.g. link type, metadata, link strength). Common visualizations for traceability information are matrices, graphs, lists, and hyperlinks. * Traceability matrix ‚Äì A traceability matrix is a table-like representation that maps artifacts of one type (e.g., requirements) depicted in columns to artifacts of another type (e.g., source code) depicted in rows. Cells visualize a trace between two artifacts if filled or a non-trace if left empty. The advantage of traceability matrices is that all links between artifacts are visible at a glance. Filters help to reduce the amount of displayed information. Traceability matrices are suitable for management tasks. However, in industry, projects often consist of thousands of artifacts: the tables could become very large and confusing. * Traceability graph ‚Äì In a traceability graph artifacts are represented as nodes. Nodes are connected by edges, if a trace link between the artifacts exists. Graphs are especially suitable for development tasks. They allow getting an overview on the links exploratively and are characterized by a high information comprehension ratio. By navigating through the graph it is easy to identify missing links as a hint to create required artifacts. * List ‚Äì Lists represent traceability links in one entry. This entry could include information concerning the source and target artifact and attributes. They are especially suitable when bulk operations for several different artifacts should be executed. Filters and sorting mechanisms allow to handle the displayed information. However, compared to the visualizations described above lists are less suitable to execute project management, development and testing tasks. * Hyperlink ‚Äì Hyperlinks connect linked artifacts and allow ‚Äújumping‚Äù from a source artifact to a linked artifact. This visualization is suitable if detailed information about an artifact is needed as it allows navigation to artifacts in their native environment. Using hyperlinks solely has the disadvantage that a lot of navigation effort is necessary to get an overview on the link status as linked artifacts are not visualized compactly. Visualizations can be combined to overcome their specific limitations.  Technical realization  = Manual traceability = Traceability is realized by capturing traces either entirely manual or tool supported, e.g. as spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel. Though widely applied, this process is cumbersome, error-prone, and often leads to traceability information that is of insufficient quality due to the various involved development tools and the typically very high number of artifacts to be traced. = Tool-supported traceability = Tool-supported traceability requires that development information that is distributed across a whole chain of development tools to be homogenized and aggregated. The following approaches exist for reaching this state: Homogenization of the tool environment via an ALM tool ‚Äì ALM tool chains cover the whole life-cycle of a system and manage all artifacts of the development process in a holistic approach. Issue trackers implementing the Volere requirements template have been used successfully in distributed environments. The advantage of this approach is that the homogenization of artifacts allows managing and analyzing them easily with dedicated tools of the ALM tool. The disadvantage is that it is necessary to implement the whole ALM tool chain. If introduced, it is difficult to replace specific tools in the tool chain. Homogenization of data via surrogate requirements ‚Äì requirements management (RM) tools allow storing, organizing, and managing all requirements of a system's specifications and typically arrange them in a specification tree that links each requirement to its parent requirement in the higher specification. Typical analysis functions based on recorded traceability information are, e.g., completeness checks i.e. do all system level requirements go down to equipment level (with or without modification), assessment of requirements deviations over all levels, and qualification status presentation. In order to ensure traceability to artifact types beyond requirements, RM tools often allow to import other artifacts as surrogate requirements that can then be traced with the tool's requirements tracing methods. The disadvantage of this approach is that different adapters or converters for the different artifact types are necessary that need to have a consistent version and data format. In contrast to ALM tools this consistency must be carried out oneself. Homogenization of data via a dedicated traceability tool - the basic concept of dedicated traceability tools consists of three essential steps: * The definition of a data model a.k.a. traceability information model (TIM). This model specifies which artifact types (e.g. stakeholder requirements, software requirements, integration tests, system model elements) and how they are linked. * The definition of mappings from all relevant data of all tools which are part of your development toolchain and how these data are mapped to the TIM. * Metrics and analysis functions are defined on the TIM - not on data residing in a specific tool. The approach unions the advantages of the aforementioned approaches: It covers all tools and artifacts in a holistic approach, homogenizes data and avoids the risk of inconsistencies caused by outdated surrogates. The disadvantage is that this approach implies the extension of a toolchain by another (traceability) tool.

Bidoglio also played in the Argentina national team, where he won two South American Championships and a silver medal at the 1928 Summer Olympics.  Career  Bidoglio made his debut with Sportivo Palermo in 1916, playing as right winger. During a match in which a fullback was injured, he had to take his place as a defender and from then on, Bidoglio would never play again in an attack position. After playing for Eureka between 1918 and 1922, he made his debut with Boca Juniors in 1923, in a friendly match against Independiente. Due to his elegant style of game, much different from strong, hard and even rude defenders, Bidoglio caught the attention of the press and the fans, soon being recognized as one of the best defenders in Argentina at that time.

Etymology √Årp√°s means barley in Hungarian, a traditional product of the farms in the area; although today much more vegetables are grown, particularly cucumbers and tomatoes. Geography, history and landmarks Aerial view of the √Årp√°s church. √Årp√°s village is situated in the north-western part of Hungary, beside the river R√°ba, about 30 km from Gy≈ër. The bridge of √Årp√°s is an important crossing point on the R√°ba. The village is built on a bench of the river with hills to the west. It is protected by a levee from the floods. Around the village there are backwater lakes, forests and fields. The municipality of √Årp√°s consists of the village proper, the river section outside the levee, and the surrounding farms, on both sides of the R√°ba, with some as much as 5 km. away from the village centre. The village is known for its Premonstratensian church (provostry) named Saint James. The provostry was founded in 1251 by M√≥ric Nagy. In 1300 √Årp√°s was the property of Count L≈ërinc Cseszneky. The convent was inhabited by Premonstratensian nuns from 1526 until 1577. And again, after the Turkish wars, Poor Clares from Nagyszombat resettled the convent. They rebuilt the church on the existing foundations with baroque style elements, finishing it in 1751. Later this church became the parish church of the village. The church is a beautiful example of the brick architecture from the √Årp√°d age. One nave is built and closed with a simple apse, with two towers on the western side of the church, as it is the case in many churches in Hungary. From the original construction it has a Romanesque western doorway with tympanon.A tympanon is a recessed, ornamental space formed by the cornices of a triangular pediment, or in this case between the arch and the lintel of the doorway. The painting behind the main altar showed a Madonna with mantle, a rather popular iconographical topic, was painted about 1660. In the early 19th century a lot of people emigrated overseas from √Årp√°s. References * Ludwig E. (2002‚Äì2008): Rejt≈ëzk√∂d≈ë Magyarorsz√°g. MN Online.

Career O'List (using the name David John) started The Attack in 1966. Managed by Don Arden, they released four singles: \\"Try It\\"/\\"We Don't Know\\" (Decca F 12550), \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\"/\\"Anymore Than I Do\\" (Decca F 12578), \\"Created By Clive\\"/\\"Colour Of My Mind\\" (Decca F 12631) and \\"Neville Thumbcatch\\"/\\"Lady Orange Peel\\" (Decca F 12725). =Personal Life= O'List is married to Satu Redmond.

P. Arnold and left The Attack in February 1967. By May the band was gigging in its own right and appeared at the National Jazz and Blues Festival that summer; their first album, however, did not appear until early 1968. Their only hit single, a re-worked version of Leonard Bernstein's \\"America\\", reached number 21 in the UK in July of that year. O'List's style in The Nice was described by Bruce Eder of Allmusic as \\"Hendrix-ish guitar ... in sharp relief.\\" However, with two strong instrumentalists competing, O'List left The Nice in autumn 1968 during the recordings for their second album. While with The Nice, O'List briefly substituted for Syd Barrett in Pink Floyd in 1967. \\"That was incredible,\\" he recalled fifty years later. \\"It felt like a dream because it was on Floyd's package tour with Jimi Hendrix. I knew Floyd's music really well ‚Äì so, when they asked me to play with them, it was quite easy.\\" Asked if the Floyd considered him as a permanent replacement for Barrett, he said: \\"Apparently they gave it some thought. They certainly came to see me play live a few times, but I was only nineteen and still quite green in the business. I should have pushed myself more.\\"Ling, Dave: \\"Davy O'List\\"; Classic Rock No. 219, February 2016, p115 =After the Nice= O'List also played briefly in Jethro Tull after the departure of Mick Abrahams. In early 1970 O'List provided guitar and bass for The Misunderstood and then Roxy Music between October 1971 and February 1972. He played in the band's first BBC session in January 1973, before leaving the group. O'List reunited with Roxy Music vocalist Bryan Ferry in 1974 as one of the guitarists on Ferry's second solo album, Another Time, Another Place. Ferry's hit cover of \\"The 'In' Crowd\\" featured an O'List guitar solo. After Roxy Music, O'List joined Jet in 1974. They released one album in 1975 and toured as support to Hunter-Ronson. =Solo career= O'List released a solo album in 1997, entitled Flight of the Eagle.

It is situated 6 km from the Slovak border and just 25 km from the Slovak capital Bratislava. The population of 1600 consists largely of a Croatian-speaking community, with some ethnic Hungarians, Slovaks and Germans. Consequently, the inhabitants communicate in a mixture of languages, none of which are used in their standard forms. Archaeological investigations reveal that the earliest inhabitants of the area were Germanic tribes. Many artifacts can be seen in the Hans√°g Museum in the town of Mosonmagyar√≥v√°r which is 25 km away, near Gy≈ër. Later on Magyar people settled in Bezenye until it was sacked by Turkish troops. Gradually the village was repopulated, this time largely by Croatian communities from Dalmatia, as well as by Germans. The Germans called it \\"Palersdorf\\", the Croatians called it \\"Bizonja\\". The origin of the name Bezenye comes from a Slav word meaning \\"elder\\" tree (\\"baza\\"). The Germans occupied themselves with the production of saltpeter. After World War II many of the poorer Germans were displaced to Germany. Several Hungarian families came to live in Bezenye, some of whom had been displaced from Slovakia. Request to include mostly Slavic village into Slovakia, together with Rusovce, Jarovce and ƒåunovo was not accepted. The village has a small museum which chronicles the history of the village.

He was the son of Nathan Ross Margold. Controversy Margold generated considerable controversy in January 1981, telling journalist Rona Barrett, in an interview aired during the initial broadcast of NBC's Tomorrow Coast-to-Coast with Tom Snyder, that he would consider performing a sex scene with his own daughter. When asked if he would allow his daughter to enter the porn business, Margold replied, \\"Not until she's eighteen. And then I might even work with her myself.\\" Ever the provocateur, Margold made similar statements on at least one previous occasion, during the taping of the adult film documentary, What Would Your Mother Say? In the wake of the Barrett controversy, Margold ran an advertisement in Variety, apologizing for the comments. An outspoken activist for industry reforms, Margold supported initiatives at the state level to raise the legal age of performers from 18 to 21 in the wake of the Traci Lords incident.

Naturally formed stone balls, such as concretions and spherulites, have been at times misidentified as petrospheres. For example, fringe archaeologists and advocates of prehistoric extraterrestrial visitors have repeatedly argued that the stone balls, which range in diameter from , found around Cerro Piedras Bola in the Sierra de Ameca, between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, in Jalisco, Mexico, are petrospheres. However, these natural stone balls are megaspherulites that have been released by erosion from a 20- to 30-million-year-old ash flow tuff, which originally enclosed them and in which they formed. The proponents of these stone balls being petrospheres base their arguments on the false claims that all of these spheres are perfectly round, that they are composed of granite, and that natural processes cannot produce stone balls. Similarly, cannonball concretions, i.e. those found along the Cannonball River in North Dakota and near Moeraki, South Island, New Zealand, also have been misidentified as petrospheres.

Life and career Born in 1885 in Milan, Italy, Palanti studied architecture in the Brera Academy and in the Politecnico di Milano university. Soon after graduation he received a Gold Medal at the International Exhibition in Brussels and arrived in Buenos Aires in 1909 with a commission to manage, with the help of his compatriot, Francisco Gianotti, the construction of the Italian Pavilion for the Exposici√≥n Internacional del Centenario (1910). For nearly 20 years he worked on both sides of the River Plate for wealthy compatriot clients. During the period 1909-1919 his designs employed variations of Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles and there then followed a period during which he carried out his most impressive work in Buenos Aires including Palacio Barolo and Hotel Castelar, both in Avenida de Mayo; an apartment building on the corner of Santa Fe Avenue and Callao Avenue; and Palacio Chrysler (today known as Palacio Alcorta) which had an automobile test track on its roof, similar to the first FIAT factory in Turin. During this period he also designed the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, and produced a large number of drawings for monumental buildings that were never built. In the final period of his work, after he returned to live in Italy in 1930, he undertook a series of projects that never materialised. He was the inventor of Palandomus. Palanti died in his native Milan in 1978. He was interred in the Civico Mausoleo Palanti, a Cimitero Monumentale di Milano mausoleum for notable local citizens of his own design.

The title refers to the golden statue of the Virgin Mary on the spire of Milan Cathedral visible all over the city, namely the Madonnina (Madunina in the Milanese dialect). The song was written and composed in 1934 by the Milan songwriter Giovanni D'Anzi (1906‚Äì1974). In the 1930s, many immigrants from the Mezzogiorno, especially from the region of Naples, came to Milan bringing with them their famous Neapolitan songs such as \\"‚ÄôO sole mio\\". D'Anzi thus decided to create a musical answer from Milan. The song became a hit in the city almost immediately, and in 1938 it topped the Italian hit parade. Musically, \\"Oh mia bela Madunina\\" has similarities to American ballads of the time. The lyrics give some praise to Neapolitan music but add that Milan also deserves a mention; they address the Madonna under whose domination Milan is vibrant with life and always busy (a pointed reference to the reputation of the Southerners whom the Milanese regarded as lazy). The lyrics end with an offer to shake hands because it is a small world, after all, but the closing verse ma Milan, l'√® on gran Milan! (\\"but Milan is a great Milan!\\") reaffirms the Milanese pride. It's often sung by AC Milan and Inter Milan fans during the matches, in particular during the Derby della Madonnina. Original lyrics A disen la canzon la nass a Napoli, e certament gh'hann minga tucc i t√≤rt. Surriento, Mergellina, tucc i p√≤poli j'avrann cantaa almen on milion de v√≤lt.

European operations  After fitting out at New York City, Osprey departed Boston, Massachusetts with five other ships on 6 April 1919 for Inverness, Scotland, arriving the 20th to join the North Sea Minesweeping Force. Basing operations at Kirkwall, Orkney Islands, she aided in taking up the North Sea Mine Barrage during the summer, departing Kirkwall on 1 October for Devonport. Osprey departed Brest for Lisbon the 15th, with sub-chaser #110 in tow. She departed Lisbon the 24th for home, arriving Staten Island, New York, 17 November. On 4 December, she proceeded to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she remained in ordinary until decommissioning 12 December 1920.  United States Coast and Geodetic Survey service  Osprey then steamed to Boston and was transferred to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey on 7 April 1922, at which time she was renamed USS Pioneer.  Return to the US Navy  Operating with the U.S. Commerce Department as Pioneer, the ship was returned to the U.S. Navy and commissioned on 17 September 1941 as USS Crusader (ARS-2). The salvage ship operated in the 15th Naval District, headquartered at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, throughout World War II.  Decommissioning  After decommissioning, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 13 February 1947.

It was founded by former Typhoon and Muscle Outlaw'z members BxB Hulk and Cyber Kong, intending to compete with the two opposing factions. Shingo Takagi and Yamato, who were on tours of the United States at the time, were also announced as members. Jack Evans, a member of Muscle Outlaw'z, joined in May 2007, teaming with Yamato as a mystery partner to defeat the MO'z team of Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino. Hulk, Kong and Takagi are former two-time holders of the Open the Triangle Gate title. History On April 17, 2007, a 7-on-7 elimination match was scheduled between the Typhoon and Muscle Outlawz factions; in the weeks leading up to this match, Cima and Naruki Doi (from Typhoon and MO'z respectively) proclaimed that someone on the opposing team would betray their partners. Typhoon won the match, after which BxB Hulk, a Typhoon member, attacked Cima, presumably to join Muscle Outlaw'z. Cyber Kong of MO'z also attacked his faction partner, Gamma, and Hulk and Kong shook hands, announcing the formation of a new stable. They said they would be joined by Shingo Takagi and Yamato Onodera, both wrestling in the U.S. at the time. Takagi returned on May 6, teaming with Hulk to defeat the Tozawa-juku team of Akira Tozawa and Kenichiro Arai; Onodera, using his former ring name Yamato, returned the following night, teaming with Hulk, Kong and Takagi to defeat Muscle Outlaw'z. After the match, the four unveiled their name and logo, proclaiming themselves New Hazard. On May 10, Jack Evans, at the time a member of MO'z, revealed himself as the mystery partner of Yamato for a tag team match against Muscle's Naruki Doi and Masato Yoshino, in which NH emerged victorious. On that same night, Takagi, Hulk and Kong defeated Typhoon's Cima, Ryo Saito and Susumu Yokosuka to claim the Open the Triangle Gate title, winning their first title since New Hazard's formation just 23 days prior. Their first and only defense came on July 1, defeating the Muscle Outlaw'z team of Naruki Doi, Masato Yoshino and Magnitude Kishiwada at Dragon Gate's annual Kobe World Hall event under controversial circumstances, as the referee counted Yoshino's shoulders down for a pinfall despite Yoshino having kicked out after a two count. On July 10, BxB Hulk suffered a broken jaw in a match against Ryo Saito in a tournament to decide the #1 contender to the Open the Dream Gate title; this forced New Hazard to vacate the Triangle Gate title on July 13. As a result, a scheduled title rematch against Doi, Yoshino and Kishiwada was changed to a decision match featuring the same Muscle Outlaw'z team facing Kong, Takagi and Jack Evans, with MO'z coming out on top. On November 9, Yamato invited Shinobu (who performed previously as Super Shenlong in Dragon Gate) to join New Hazard, after he lost a Mascara contra Caballera (mask vs. hair) match to Y≈´ki ≈åno. Shinobu accepted Yamato's invitation, but he only appeared on larger shows. PWG and ROH wrestler El Generico joined them in the summer of 2007, followed by ROH wrestler Austin Aries at the end of the year. While he was never sworn in as an official member, Jack Evans would align with them whenever he wrestled for Dragon Gate. On April 17, 2008, Yamato betrayed New Hazard and joined the Muscle Outlaw'z faction after turning on his tag partner Naoki Tanisaki in a match against Gamma and Genki Horiguchi. However, this was all a ruse, for on May 14, Shingo and Kong turned on BxB Hulk before they were to defend their Open the Triangle Gate titles against Gamma, Yamato and Genki, ending New Hazard after a year of activity. Shingo and Kong then shook hands with the remainder of the Muscle Outlaw'z faction, revealing the ruse as the formation of DG's newest super-heel group, Real Hazard. Shinobu would eventually become an \\"exchange student\\" in the Tozawa-juku faction.

It first aired on May 1, 2011. It was written by the show creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by series regular Brian Kirk, his directorial debut for the series. The plot follows Jon Snow's training at The Wall; Eddard's arrival at King's Landing, followed by Catelyn, looking for Bran's would-be murderer; Arya reveals her desire to learn sword fighting to her father; Joffrey is given a lesson in ruling the Kingdom by Cersei, and Robert longs for the glory of his past. Meanwhile, Daenerys learns she is pregnant. The episode was the first to feature Old Nan, played by Margaret John, who died before the series was broadcast; the episode is dedicated to her memory in the final credit. The title of the episode is the demeaning nickname given to Jon Snow by Ser Alliser Thorne, the sadistic trainer of Night's Watch recruits, referring to the fact that he's highborn, yet ended up at the Wall. Critical reception was generally positive, with critics praising Maisie Williams for her portrayal of Arya Stark, and her sword lesson scenes, as well as the introduction of the Small Council, and further character development for the series. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 2.4 million in its initial broadcast. Plot =In the Dothraki Sea= Daenerys gains confidence and earns the respect of Ser Jorah Mormont. After assaulting her, Viserys is nearly killed by one of Danerys's bloodriders. Irri notices that Daenerys is pregnant and Jorah, upon being told, departs for Qohor for supplies. Later, Daenerys reveals to Drogo that their child is a boy =In Winterfell= With Bran now awake, Robb tells him that he will never walk again. Bran, saying he is unable to remember anything about his fall, wishes he was dead. =At the Wall= Jon easily beats his fellow recruits in combat. Master-at-arms Ser Alliser berates them all for their poor performance, even Jon, nicknaming him \\"Lord Snow\\" to mock his bastard heritage. Jon asks Benjen to take him north of the Wall, but he tells Jon that he must earn it. Jon makes amends by giving his fellow recruits proper sword training. Tyrion is asked to provide more men from Cersei and Jaime for the outnumbered Night's Watch. Though skeptical, Tyrion agrees to do so; he departs the Wall and says goodbye to Jon, who finally accepts Tyrion as a friend. =In King's Landing= On his way to a meeting of the king's Small Council, Ned encounters Jaime Lannister. It is revealed that Jaime killed the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, father of Daenerys and Viserys. Ned remains dissatisfied that Jaime broke his oath as knight of the Kingsguard. Ned joins the Small Council, consisting of Robert's brother Lord Renly, Lord Varys, Grand Maester Pycelle, and Lord Petyr \\"Littlefinger\\" Baelish. Renly announces Robert's plans for a great tourney in honor of Ned's appointment as the Hand of the King. Ned learns that the crown is heavily indebted. Upon arriving in King's Landing, Catelyn is taken to a brothel owned by Littlefinger who, along with Varys and Ser Rodrik, discuss the attempt on Bran's life. Littlefinger admits that the assassin's dagger was once his but he lost it to Tyrion. Ned agrees to ally with Littlefinger to find who is responsible for Bran's attempted murder. Ned returns to his keep to find Sansa and Arya arguing, with Arya angry at Sansa for lying for Joffrey. Ned reminds her that Sansa and Joffrey will be married one day. Learning that Arya aspires to be a swordsman and has a sword of her own, Ned hires Syrio Forel to teach her the art of swordsmanship. Production =Writing= The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. \\"Lord Snow\\" was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on A Game of Thrones by George R. R. Martin, including chapters 18-22, 24 and 37. (Catelyn IV, Jon III, Eddard IV, Tyrion III, Arya II, Bran IV and Daenerys IV). =Casting= The third episode introduces a number of new characters to the story, due to the expansion of the story to the new locales of King's Landing and the Wall. In the capital city the members of the council are presented. Series regular Aidan Gillen, known for his roles in Queer as Folk and The Wire takes the role of Lord Petyr Baelish, the king's master of coin known as \\"Littlefinger.\\" Gethin Anthony plays the king's youngest brother Renly Baratheon, and veteran actor Julian Glover, well known to science fiction and fantasy fans after appearing in films such as The Empire Strikes Back and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, was cast as Grand Maester Pycelle after actor Roy Dotrice had to be replaced for medical reasons. Author George R. R. Martin wrote on the casting of Conleth Hill as spymaster Varys: \\"Hill, like Varys, is quite a chameleon, an actor who truly disappears inside the characters he portrays, more than capable not only of bringing the slimy, simpering eunuch to life.\\" Ian McElhinney plays Ser Barristan Selmy, the commander of the Kingsguard, and Miltos Yorelemou appears as the fencing instructor Syrio Forel. McElhinney had previously played Gillen's father in Queer as Folk. The hierarchy of the Wall is introduced with James Cosmo as commander Jeor Mormont, Peter Vaughan as the blind maester Aemon, Owen Teale as the trainer of the new recruits Ser Alliser Thorne, and Francis Magee as the recruiter Yoren. This episode also marks the first appearance of the Welsh actress Margaret John as Old Nan. 84-year-old Margaret John died on 2 February 2011, a few months after having finished recording her scenes in Game of Thrones, which was her last role on television. Executive producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss issued a statement grieving her death. The episode \\"Lord Snow\\" is dedicated to her, with the last credit being \\"In the memory of Margaret John.\\" The Mdina Gate doubles as the gate of the Red Keep. =Filming locations= To film the scenes at the Wall the production built a set on the abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry as the basis for the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a real elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall. For the streets of King's Landing, the production flew to Malta. The gate of Fort Ricasoli doubled as the King's Gate, shown at the beginning of the episode when the royal entourage enters the city. The entrance of the Red Keep used when Catelyn and Rodrik enter the fortification corresponds to Mdina Gate, and also in Mdina the Pjazza Mesquita is the location for the entrance to the brothel owned by Lord Baelish. Ron Donachie, the actor playing Ser Rodrik Cassel, said that the scene where he entered King's Landing was his favourite moment. Visiting a museum in the Maltese capital of Valletta, Donachie had seen a painting of armed knights riding through that Gate of Mdina itself and found exciting that to be able to do the same thing, \\"especially in Rodrik‚Äôs full-scale Stark battle regalia\\". =Other= On the scene where Old Nan offers to tell Bran stories, she claims that his favorites are the ones about Ser Duncan the Tall. The tales of Duncan and his squire Egg are a series of novellas written by author George R. R. Martin, taking place about a hundred years before the events of Game of Thrones. Reception =Ratings= \\"Lord Snow\\"'s first airing was seen by 2.4 million viewers, which represented a 10% increase in the ratings from the two previous episodes. Combined with the second airing it reached 3.1 million viewers, which were considered good results especially considering that the news of Osama Bin Laden's death broke during the West Coast airing of the episode. In the UK, the viewership figures were in line with those obtained on the previous week, with around 510,000 viewers. Those figures are in the top end for the network, Sky Atlantic. =Critical response= While the majority of the critics gave \\"Lord Snow\\" a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 14 reviews of the episode and judged 86% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development.\\" Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was \\"perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six,\\" although he highlighted that it was \\"hardly a bad episode of television, filled as it is with satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series,\\" and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the \\"more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked \\"because the stories are being told with such passion.\\" IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that \\"Lord Snow\\" was \\"dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, which may or may not have interested those new to this story - but I found myself hanging on every precious word.\\" Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying \\"Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, simple thing that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on\\" and continued \\"I liked the looser, more rambling quality of \\"Lord Snow,\\" an episode largely about transitions, fish out of water, and old ghosts. Some of the scenes were highly praised by reviewers. The closing scene with Arya taking her first lesson from the Braavosi Syrio Forel was highlighted. Maureen Ryan from AOL TV stated that it was her favorite scene of the series so far, and James Hibberd remarked upon the quality of all the child actors of the show and stated that Maisie Williams owned her role in this episode. Other scenes that were noted by the critics were the father-daughter dialogue with Eddard Stark and Arya, King Robert remembering with the members of his Kingsguard their first killings, and Eddard attending his first session of the Small Council.

Initially a boss for amateur teams, having spent three seasons in Seconda Categoria (second-lowest division in Italian football) and three others in Prima Categoria, he led a Promozione team, Cerreto, to reach Serie D in 1990 (there was no Eccellenza division at that time). From 1992 to 1998 Castori coached Eccellenza team Tolentino leading them to Serie C2. In 1998-1999 he won a Serie D league and a Scudetto Dilettanti with Lanciano. After a poor Serie C1 season with Castel di Sangro, he returned at Lanciano in 2000, and immediately won the Serie C2 league. He stayed at Lanciano until 2003. = Cesena = In the summer 2003 he was appointed head coach of Serie C1 team Cesena. At his first season, he led Cesena to win the promotion playoffs and the Coppa Italia Serie C; this however was obscured by a 3-year ban on him after having been protagonist of a riot during the return leg of the promotion playoff finals against Lumezzane. The ban was successively reduced to 2 years following a pardon request by Castori himself; during this time, Castori was unable to serve as head coach but, despite this, he was confirmed as Cesena's boss, with assistant manager Massimo Gadda serving at his place on the dugout until 23 January 2006. On 11 November 2007, following a 1‚Äì4 loss to Rimini in a regional derby and only seven points gained in the first fourteen matches, Castori was dismissed by Cesena, after four seasons at the helm of the bianconeri, but was reinstated at his managing role only three months later following Giovanni Vavassori's dismissal on 25 February 2008; his comeback at Cesena proved however to be unsuccessful, as the bianconeri were relegated to Serie C1 at the end of the season. = Salernitana = Castori served the 2008‚Äì09 season as head coach of newly promoted Serie B team Salernitana.

History The first Marist School in Australia, St Patrick's, was established in 1872 by four Marist Brothers (Brothers Ludovic Laboureyras, Jarlath Finand, Augustinus MacDonald and Peter Tennyson), at The Rocks in Sydney. On 2 February 1937, Brother Leopold Smith and three other Marist brothers (Brothers Ervan McDonough, Loyola Sullivan and Kenneth Harris) came to Eastwood and opened St Kevin's Boys' School, with 100 students. The school was established on the site of Eastwood House, the home built by William Rutledge and purchased by Edward Terry in 1863. Terry became the first mayor of Eastwood and later a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and Eastwood House, with its extensive gardens, orchards and sporting grounds, was the location of many hunts. The house, built in 1840 and extended in 1863, forms the central administration block for the College today. In the 1960s the school was known as Marist Brothers' High School, Eastwood, and on 2 April 1993 the name of the school was changed to Marist College Eastwood. In April 1999, teacher and student representatives of the school, were sent to Rome, to join with other teachers and students from Marist Schools around the world, to celebrate the canonisation of Marcellin Champagnat.

Each isoenzyme is a homodimer composed of 2 alpha, 2 gamma, or 2 beta subunits, and functions as a glycolytic enzyme. Alpha-enolase, in addition, functions as a structural lens protein (tau-crystallin) in the monomeric form. Alternative splicing of this gene results in a shorter isoform that has been shown to bind to the c-myc promoter and function as a tumor suppressor. Several pseudogenes have been identified, including one on the long arm of chromosome 1. Alpha-enolase has also been identified as an autoantigen in Hashimoto encephalopathy.  Structure  ENO1 is one of three enolase isoforms, the other two being ENO2 (ENO-Œ≥) and ENO3 (ENO-Œ≤). Each isoform is a protein subunit that can hetero- or homodimerize to form Œ±Œ±, Œ±Œ≤, Œ±Œ≥, Œ≤Œ≤, and Œ≥Œ≥ dimers. The ENO1 gene spans 18 kb and lacks a TATA box while possessing multiple transcription start sites. A hypoxia-responsive element can be found in the ENO1 promoter and allows the enzyme to function in aerobic glycolysis and contribute to the Warburg effect in tumor cells. = Relationship to Myc-binding protein-1 = The mRNA transcript of the ENO1 gene can be alternatively translated into a cytoplasmic protein, with a molecular weight of 48 kDa, or a nuclear protein, with a molecular weight of a 37 kDa. The nuclear form was previously identified as Myc-binding protein-1 (MBP1), which downregulates the protein level of the c-myc protooncogene. A start codon at codon 97 of ENO1 and a Kozak consensus sequence were found preceding the 3' region of ENO1 encoding the MBP1 protein. In addition, the N-terminal region of the MBP1 protein it critical to DNA binding and, thus, its inhibitory function.  Function  As an enolase, ENO1 is a glycolytic enzyme the catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This isozyme is ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues, including liver, brain, kidney, and spleen. Within cells, ENO1 predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm, though an alternatively translated form is localized to the nucleus. Its nuclear form, also known as MBP1, functions solely as a tumor suppressor by binding and inhibiting the c-myc protooncogene promoter, and lacks the glycolytic enzyme activity of the cytoplasmic form. ENO1 also plays a role in other functions, including a cell surface receptor for plasminogen on pathogens, such as streptococci, and activated immune cells, leading to systemic infection or tissue invasion; an oxidative stress protein in endothelial cells; a lens crystalline; a heat shock protein; and a binding partner of cytoskeletal and chromatin structures to aid in transcription.  Clinical significance  = Cancer = ENO1 overexpression has been associated with multiple tumors, including glioma, neuroendocrine tumors, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. In many of these tumors, ENO1 promoted cell proliferation by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induced tumorigenesis by activating plasminogen. Moreover, ENO1 is expressed on the tumor cell surface during pathological conditions such as inflammation, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Its role as a plasminogen receptor leads to extracellular matrix degradation and cancer invasion. Due to its surface expression, targeting surface ENO1 enables selective targeting of tumor cells while leaving the ENO1 inside normal cells functional. Moreover, in tumors such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and breast cancer, inhibition of ENO1 expression decreased tolerance to hypoxia while increasing sensitivity to radiation therapy, thus indicating that ENO1 may have aided chemoresistance. Considering these factors, ENO1 holds great potential to serve as an effective therapeutic target for treating many types of tumors in patients. ENO1 is located on the 1p36 tumor suppressor locus near MIR34A which is homozygously deleted in Glioblastoma, Hepatocellular carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma. The co-deletion of ENO1 is a passenger event with the resultant tumor cells being entirely dependent on ENO2 for the execution of glycolysis. Tumor cells with such deletions are exceptionally sensitive towards ablation of ENO2. Inhibition of ENO2 in ENO1-homozygously deleted cancer cells constitutes an example of synthetic lethality treatment for cancer. = Autoimmune disease = ENO1 has been detected in serum drawn from children diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Alpha-enolase has been identified as an autoantigen in Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Single studies have also identified it as an autoantigen associated with severe asthma and a putative target antigen of anti- endothelial cell antibody in Beh√ßet's disease. Reduced expression of the enzyme has been found in the corneal epithelium of people suffering from keratoconus. = Gastrointestinal disease = CagA protein was found to activate ENO1 expression through activating the Src and MEK/ERK pathways as a mechanism for H. pylori-mediated gastric diseases. = Hemolytic anemia = Enolase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism disease, leads to hemolytic anemia in affected homozygous carriers of loss of function mutations in ENO1. As with other glycolysis enzyme deficiency diseases, the condition is aggravated by redox-cycling agents such as nitrofurantoin.

It is managed by The Historic Environment Division of The Department for Communities and is open to the public. It is known in Irish as Muileann gaoithe Bhaile Ch√≥plainn and in Ulster-Scots as Ballycopelann Wun-m√§ll.Ballycopelann Wun-m√§ll ‚Äì Department of the Environment Ballycopeland is currency closed to the public, though works are due to begin in early September for restoration of the mill and a new Visitor Centre. Work is estimated to end in May 2021. Features It is a typical Irish stone tower mill, with a moveable cap turned by means of an automatic fantail, ensuring that the sails always faced into the wind. When the wind blows directly onto the sails the blades or vanes of the fantail are not moved. However, if the wind veers, it catches the blades and the whole cap turns on an iron ring or ‚Äòcurb‚Äô, bringing the sails back into the wind. As well as the ground floor the mill has three storeys ‚Äì a ‚Äòdrive‚Äô floor, ‚Äòstone‚Äô floor and ‚Äòhopper‚Äô floor, from the first to third level respectively. The rotating cap sits above the hopper floor. Three pairs of millstones sit at the ‚Äòstone‚Äô floor ‚Äì one set for making wheatmeal, one for shelling the grains of corn (a process which separated the useless ‚Äòhulls‚Äô from the valuable ‚Äòseeds‚Äô or grain) and a set for grinding grains into oatmeal. The power of the wind is transmitted back from the sails or ‚Äòsweeps‚Äô by means of the central ‚Äòwindshaft‚Äô passing back into the cap. On the inner end of the rotating windshaft is the ‚Äòbrake wheel‚Äô which drives a bevel gearwheel or ‚Äòwallower‚Äô perched on top of the main (vertical) driveshaft. This power turns the three sets of grinding stones below. The sails would have been covered with canvas sailcloth. The amount of sailcloth used determined the amount of power and this would have been adjusted from within the cap, even while the sails were turning, to suit the particular grinding requirements at any given time. Ballycopeland produced oatmeal and wheatmeal for human consumption, as well as animal feed such as shelled and bruised oats, yellow meal (from maize), kibbled (crushed) grain for poultry and ground peas and beans. The visitor centre at the miller‚Äôs house features an electrically operated model of the mill and hands-on experience of milling. There is also a restored corn-drying kiln. History The plastered and white-washed tapering tower is a landmark in that area and the last remaining windmill of more than hundred mills in County Down. It is estimated that Ballycopeland windmill was built around the 1780s or 90s, appearing on the first Ordnance Survey maps of the area in 1830s. It was owned by the McGilton family and the mill ground grain until 1915. In 1935 it was acquired by the government of Northern Ireland. Disused for many decades, in 1978, the old windmill was restored to working order again.

First launched in August 2007, OneDrive allows users to store files and personal data like Windows settings or BitLocker recovery keys in the cloud, share files, and sync files across Android, Windows Phone, and iOS mobile devices, Windows and macOS computers, and the Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles. Users can upload Microsoft Office documents to OneDrive. OneDrive offers 5 GB of storage space free of charge, with 100 GB, 1 TB, and 6 TB storage options available either separately or with Office 365 subscriptions. History Windows Live Folders logo Logo as \\"SkyDrive\\" At its launch the service, known as Windows Live Folders at the time (with a codename of SkyDrive), was provided as a limited beta available to a few testers in the United States. On August 1, 2007, the service was expanded to a wider audience. Shortly thereafter, on August 9, 2007, the service was renamed Windows Live SkyDrive and made available to testers in the United Kingdom and India. SkyDrive was initially available in 38 countries and regions., later expanded to 62. On December 2, 2008, the capacity of an individual SkyDrive account was upgraded from 5 GB to 25 GB, and Microsoft added a separate entry point called Windows Live Photos which allowed users to access their photos and videos stored on SkyDrive. This entry point allowed users to add \\"People tags\\" to their photos, download photos into Windows Photo Gallery or as a ZIP file, as well as viewing Exif metadata such as camera information for the photos uploaded. Microsoft also added the ability to have full-screen slide shows for photos using Silverlight. SkyDrive was updated to \\"Wave 4\\" release on June 7, 2010, and added the ability to work with Office Web Apps (now known as Office Online), with versioning. In this update, due to the discontinuation of Windows Live Toolbar, the ability to synchronise and share bookmarked web links between users via SkyDrive was also discontinued. However, users were still able to use Windows Live Mesh, which replaced the previous Windows Live Favorites, to synchronize their favorites between computers until its discontinuation in February 2013. In June 2010, users of Office Live Workspace, released in October 2007, were migrated to Windows Live Office. The migration included all existing workspaces, documents, and sharing permissions. The merger of the two services was a result of Microsoft's decision to merge its Office Live team into Windows Live in January 2009, as well as several deficiencies with Office Live Workspace, which lacked high- fidelity document viewing and did not allow files to be edited from within the web browser. Office Live Workspace also did not offer offline collaboration and co-authoring functionality ‚Äì instead documents were \\"checked out\\" and \\"checked in\\", though the service did integrate with SharedView for real-time screen sharing. On June 20, 2011, Microsoft overhauled the user interface for SkyDrive, built using HTML5 technologies. The updated version featured caching, hardware acceleration, HTML5 video, quick views, cleaner arrangement of photos and infinite scrolling. Microsoft also doubled the file size limit from 50 MB (1 MB = 1 million bytes) to 100 MB per file. With this update, Microsoft consolidated the different entry points for SkyDrive, such as Windows Live Photos and Windows Live Office, into one single interface. Files and folders shared with a user, including those in Windows Live Groups, were also accessible in the new interface. On November 29, 2011, Microsoft updated SkyDrive to make sharing and file management easier, as well as HTML5 and other updates. This update also allowed users to see how much storage they had (and how much they had used), a feature that had been removed in the previous update as part of the redesign. On December 3, 2011, Microsoft released SkyDrive apps for iOS and Windows Phone, which are available in the App Store and Windows Phone Store respectively. On April 22, 2012, Microsoft released a SkyDrive desktop app for Windows Vista, 7 and 8, as well as macOS, allowing users to synchronize files on SkyDrive, much like Windows Live Mesh, and to \\"fetch\\" files on their computer via the web browser. In addition, SkyDrive also provided additional storage available for purchase and reduced the free storage space for new users to 7 GB (from 25 GB) (1 GB = 1 billion bytes). Existing users were offered a free upgrade offer to retain their 25 GB of free storage. The updated SkyDrive also allowed files up to 2 GB in size (uploaded via the SkyDrive desktop app). The update also brought additional features such as Open Document Format (ODF) capability, URL shortening services and direct sharing of files to Twitter. On August 14, 2012, Microsoft announced a new update for SkyDrive which brought changes and improvements to SkyDrive.com, SkyDrive for Windows desktop and OS X, and the SkyDrive API as part of Live Connect. For SkyDrive.com, the updates brought a new \\"modern\\" design for the web service consistent with Outlook.com, and along with the UI update the service also received improvements such as instant search, contextual toolbar, multi-select in thumbnail view, drag-and-drop files into folders, and sorting improvements. For the SkyDrive for Windows desktop and macOS applications, the update brought new performance improvements to photo uploads and the sync experience. The update also improved the SkyDrive API with the removal of file type restrictions, ability to upload images in their full resolution, as well as a new SkyDrive file picker for opening and saving files. On August 28, 2012, Microsoft released a SkyDrive app for Android on Google Play store. On September 18, 2012, Microsoft also introduced a recycle bin feature on SkyDrive and announced that SkyDrive will allow users to create online surveys via Excel Web App. =Sky lawsuit and OneDrive renaming= Microsoft became involved in a lawsuit with British television broadcaster Sky UK for using the word \\"Sky\\", resulting in a High Court ruling in June 2013 that the service's brand breached Sky's trademark. On July 31, 2013, in a joint press release between Sky and Microsoft, it was announced that a settlement had been reached and as a result the SkyDrive name would be dropped. Sky allowed Microsoft to continue using the brand \\"for a reasonable period of time to allow for an orderly transition to a new brand\\". \\"SkyDrive\\" was renamed \\"OneDrive\\" on most platforms on February 19, 2014, following an announcement on January 27. On June 18, 2015, Microsoft launched an improved design of OneDrive for the web. In 2015 Microsoft removed the unlimited storage plan for Office 365 Home, Personal and University packages, reduced the free OneDrive storage from 15 GB to 5 GB, and replaced paid subscriptions to 100 GB and 200 GB plans to a $1.99 per month 50 GB plan. These changes caused major controversy with users, some of whom petitioned Microsoft to reverse the plans. By November 21, 2015, in response to Microsoft's November 2 announcement, over 70,000 people had taken to the official OneDrive uservoice to voice their concerns. According to Microsoft these changes were a response to people abusing the service by using OneDrive to store PC backups, movie collections, and DVR recordings.  Storage  =Quota= the service offers 5 GB of free storage for new users. Additional storage is available for purchase. The amount of storage available has changed several times. Initially, the service provided 7 GB of storage and, for one year, an additional 3 GB of free storage to students. Users who signed up to OneDrive prior to April 22, 2012 were able to opt-in for a limited time offer of 25 GB of free storage upgrade. The service is built using HTML5 technologies, and files up to 300 MB can be uploaded via drag and drop into the web browser, or up to 10 GB via the OneDrive desktop application for Microsoft Windows and OS X. From September 23, 2013 onwards, in addition to 7 GB of free storage (or 25 GB for users eligible for the free upgrade), power users who required more storage could choose from one of four paid storage plans. Users in some regions may need to have a certain payment card or PayPal account to pay. The paid storage plan is renewed automatically each year unless Microsoft or the user cancels the service. Upon the re-launch as OneDrive, monthly payment plans were introduced, along with the ability to earn up to 5 GB of free storage for referring new users to OneDrive (500 MB each), and 3 GB if users enable automatic uploads of photos using the OneDrive mobile apps on smartphones. Subscribers to Office 365's home-oriented plans also receive additional storage for use with the service, with 20 GB per user. In June 2014 it was announced that OneDrive's default storage would increase to 15 GB, putting it in line with its competitor Google Drive. An additional 15 GB were offered for activating camera roll backup on a mobile device, putting it ahead of Google Drive until November 2015, when this bonus was cancelled. The amount of additional storage for Office 365 subscribers also increased to 1 TB. Microsoft reduced the price of OneDrive storage subscriptions at that time. In October 2014 Microsoft announced that it would offer unlimited OneDrive storage to all Office 365 subscribers. However, on November 3, 2015, the 1 TB cap was reinstated. Microsoft additionally announced the planned replacement of its 100 GB and 200 GB plans with a new 50 GB plan in early 2016, and the reduction of free storage from 15 GB to 5 GB. Any current accounts over this limit could keep the increased storage for at least 12 months. Following calls for Microsoft to reverse the reduction decision, Microsoft announced on December 11 of the same year that it would allow existing users to request to have up to 30 GB of free storage unaffected by the reduction, and said it would fully refund customers of Office 365 not satisfied with the 1 TB cap (1 TB = 1000 billion bytes), among other redress. In June 2019, alongside the announcement for the Personal Vault, Microsoft announced that it would increase the OneDrive standalone storage plan from 50 GB to 100 GB at no additional charge, and that it would be giving Office 365 subscribers a new option to add more storage as they need it. =Versioning= OneDrive initially did not store previous versions of files, except for Microsoft Office formats. In July 2017, however, Microsoft OneDrive team announced that version history support for all file types was the top requested feature; as such, OneDrive would keep older versions of all files for up to 30 days. =Recycle bin= OneDrive implements a \\"recycle bin\\"; files the user chooses to delete are stored there for a time, without counting as part of the user's allocation, and can be reinstated until they are ultimately purged from OneDrive. = Download as ZIP files = Entire folders can be downloaded as a single ZIP file with OneDrive. For a single download, there is a limit of 15 GB; the total ZIP file size limit is 20 GB; and up to 10,000 files can be included in a ZIP file. = Files On-Demand = On Windows 10, OneDrive can utilize Files On-Demand, where files synchronized with OneDrive show up in file listings, but do not require any disk space. As soon as the content of the file is required, the file is downloaded in the background. Editing =Office for the web= Microsoft added Office for the web (known at the time as Office Web Apps and later Office Online) capability to OneDrive in its \\"Wave 4\\" update, allowing users to upload, create, edit and share Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote documents directly within a web browser. In addition, Office for the web allows multiple users to simultaneously co-author Excel documents in a web browser, and co-author OneNote documents with another web user or the desktop application. Users can also view the version history of Office documents stored on OneDrive. =Formats= OneDrive allows the viewing of documents in Portable Document Format (PDF), and in the Open Document Format (ODF), an XML-based file format supported by a number of word processing applications, including Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice and Corel's WordPerfect. OneDrive's search function supports search within PDF documents. OneDrive includes an online text editor that allows users to view and edit files in plain text format, such as text files and batch files. Syntax highlighting and code completion is available for a number of programming and markup languages, including C#, Visual Basic, JavaScript, Windows PowerShell, CSS, HTML, XML, PHP and Java. This online editor includes a find-and-replace feature and a way to manage file merging conflicts. Photos and videos OneDrive can use geo-location data for photos uploaded to the service, and will automatically display a map of the tagged location. OneDrive also allows users to tag people in photos uploaded via the web interface or via Windows Photo Gallery. Photos uploaded to OneDrive can be played as an automatic slideshow. Images uploaded to OneDrive will be recognized as 360¬∞ images if they are clicked with popular models of 360¬∞ cameras in a panoramic mode, right from within the OneDrive. Client apps Microsoft has released OneDrive client applications for Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows Phone Xbox 360, and Xbox One that allow users to browse, view and organize files stored on their OneDrive cloud storage. In addition, Microsoft also released desktop applications for Microsoft Windows (Vista and later) and OS X (10.7 Lion and later) that allow users to synchronize their entire OneDrive storage with their computers for offline access, as well as between multiple computers. The OneDrive client for Windows allows users to \\"fetch\\" the contents of their PCs via the web browser, provided the user enabled this option; macOS users can fetch from a PC, but not vice versa. The Android, iOS and Windows Phone 8 versions also allow camera photos to automatically be uploaded to OneDrive. Upon the re-branding as OneDrive, the Xbox One app also added achievements. In addition to the client apps, OneDrive is integrated into Windows 8.1 and later, Microsoft Office 2010 and later, as well as the Office and Photos hub in Windows Phone, enabling users to access documents, photos and videos stored on their OneDrive account. OneDrive in Windows 8.1 can sync user settings and files, through either the included OneDrive app (originally called SkyDrive, until the name was changed with a Windows update) or File Explorer, deprecating the previous Windows client. Along with the use of reparse points, these changes allow files to be accessed directly from OneDrive as if they are stored locally. The OneDrive app was also updated to include a local file manager. Unlike on Windows 8, use of OneDrive on Windows 8.1 requires the user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous OneDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) no longer works on Windows 8.1. Additionally, the Fetch feature does not work on Windows 8.1. In an update on July 4, 2017, OneDrive desktop client started showing an error message to the effect that the local OneDrive folder must be located on an NTFS volume only. Other file systems, including the older FAT32 and exFAT, as well as the newer ReFS were not supported. Microsoft further commented that this was always the requirement; it had merely fixed a bug in which the warning was not displayed. Microsoft also denied this feature having anything to do with the forthcoming OneDrive Files On-Demand. =Integration with Microsoft Office= Microsoft Office, starting with Microsoft Office 2010 and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, allows users to directly open or save documents to OneDrive, or simultaneously edit shared documents with other users. Changes are synchronized when a document is saved and, where conflicts occur, the saving user can choose which version to keep; users can also use several different desktop and web programs to edit the same shared document. Microsoft OneNote users can sync one or more of their notebooks using OneDrive. Once a notebook is selected for sharing, OneDrive copies the notebook from the user's computer to OneDrive, and that online copy then becomes the original for all future changes. The originating copy remains on the user's hard drive but is no longer updated by OneNote. Users can switch back to an offline-only version of the notebook by manually changing its location in OneNote, but unpredictable results may occur, including the OneNote application crashing and loss of notebook data under certain conditions. Under such circumstances, re-sharing the Notebook to OneDrive may result in recovery of the lost data. = Personal Vault = In September 2019 Microsoft announced Personal Vault. It is a protected area in OneDrive where users can store their most important or sensitive files and photos without sacrificing the convenience of anywhere access. Personal Vault has a strong authentication method or a second step of identity verification, such as fingerprint, face, PIN, or a code sent via email or SMS. Personal Vault is not available in macOS app.  Interoperability  OneDrive allows users to embed their Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents into other web pages. These embedded documents allow anyone who visits these web pages to interact with them, such as browsing an embedded PowerPoint slideshow or perform calculations within an embedded Excel spreadsheet. In addition, Microsoft has released a set of APIs for OneDrive via Live Connect to enable developers to develop web services and client apps utilizing OneDrive's cloud storage. This allows users of these web services and client apps to browse, view, upload or edit files stored on OneDrive. A software development kit (SDK) is available for .NET Framework, iOS, Android and Python with a limited set of API for web apps and Windows. OneDrive is already interoperable with a host of web services, including: * Outlook.com: Allows users to:  Directly upload Office documents and photos within Outlook.com, store them on OneDrive and share them with other users.  Directly save Office documents within Outlook.com to OneDrive, and view or edit these documents directly within the web browser.  Edit Office documents within the web browser using Office Online and reply directly back to the sender with the edits made. * Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn: Enables users to quickly share their files with their contacts on these social networks. OneDrive maintains an access control list of all users with permissions to view or edit the files, including those users on social networks. * Bing: Save & Share feature allows users to save search histories into a OneDrive folder. * Windows Live Groups: Before being discontinued, Windows Live Groups provided each group with 1 GB of storage space on OneDrive to be shared between the group members. Group members were allowed to access, create, modify and delete files within the group's OneDrive folders, along with the other functionality that OneDrive provides. However, these features eventually became native to OneDrive. Privacy concerns Data stored on OneDrive is subject to monitoring by Microsoft, and any content that is in violation of Microsoft's Code of Conduct is subject to removal and may lead to temporary or permanent shutdown of the account. This has led to privacy concerns in relation to data stored on OneDrive. Microsoft has responded by indicating that \\"strict internal policies [are] in place to limit access to a user‚Äôs data\\", and that advanced mechanisms, such as Microsoft's automated PhotoDNA scanning tool, are utilized to ensure users abide with the Code of Conduct and that their account does not contain files in contravention thereof, such as partial human nudity (including art or drawings), or any online surveys. OneDrive for Business Microsoft has a similarly named but unrelated software plus service offering called OneDrive for Business (previously SkyDrive Pro). While OneDrive is a personal storage service on the web, OneDrive for Business is a managed cloud storage for business users that replaces SharePoint Workspace. The physical medium on which the information is stored can be either hosted on-premises or purchased as service subscription from Microsoft.

Avtorkhanov. Memuary [Memoirs] (Frankfurt/Main: Possev- Verlag, 1983), pp. 611ff. During the war, he published in many newspapers of Nazi Germany. After the war, Avtorkhanov became a co-founder of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in 1951. Autorkhanov authored numerous books and articles on the history and core issues of Communism. His book Staline au pouvoir (The Reign of Stalin), published in French in 1951, described Joseph Stalin's reign of terror.Ken Coates Spluttering Taper International Socialism (1st series), No.4, Spring 1961, p.32. His book Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party is regarded as a primary source for the political background of Stalin's rise to power. He was one of the first authors to claim, in his 1976 book on Stalin's death, that Stalin had been murdered by the head of NKVD Lavrentiy Beria. Pyotr Grigorenko made and distributed copies of the book in the Soviet Union by photographing and typewriting. In his books, Avtorkhanov emphasized the leading role of Soviet security services in keeping the regime alive: One of his books named \\"Murder of Chechen-Ingush nation\\" (in Russian: \\"–£–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ —á–µ—á–µ–Ω–æ-–∏–Ω–≥—É—à—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞\\") is still very popular among Chechens and Ingush today. A few months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Avtorkhanov was granted honorary citizenship by the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. At the time of the First Chechen War he maintained a correspondence with the Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev. He also urged peace negotiations on Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

It is developed by the TM Forum. Structure Frameworx consists of four frameworks: * Application Framework (sometimes referred to as the Telecom Application Map (TAM)) * Business Process Framework (eTOM) * Information Framework (sometimes referred to as the Shared Information/Data (SID) model) * Integration Frameworks (which is developed in the TM Forum Integration Program (TIP)) =Information Framework= The Information Framework (formally Shared Information/Data Model or SID) is a unified reference data model providing a single set of terms for business objects in telecommunications. The objective is to enable people in different departments, companies or geographical locations to use the same terms to describe the same real world objects, practices and relationships. It is part of Frameworx. The Information Framework, as the Frameworx information model, provides an information/data reference model and a common information/data vocabulary from a business as well as a systems perspective. The Information Framework uses Unified Modeling Language to formalize the expression of the needs of a particular stakeholder viewpoint. The Information Framework provides the common language for communicating the concerns of the four major groups of constituents (stakeholders) represented by the Frameworx Viewpoints - Business, System, Implementation and Deployment, as defined in the Frameworx Lifecycle. Used in combination with the Business Process Framework (eTOM) business process and activity descriptions and the Telecom Application Map the Information Framework make it possible to bridge between the business and Information Technology groups within an organization by providing definitions that are understandable by the business, but are also rigorous enough to be used for software development. The Information Framework model takes inspiration from a wide variety of industry sources, but its principal origins are the Alliance Common Information Architecture (ACIA) created by a team led by Bill Brook from AT&T; and BT Group and the Directory Enabled Networks - next generation (DEN-ng) model created by John Strassner. When initially released in 2000, the Information Framework model covered the business (BSS) arena well, and also the device management field well, but was insufficient in its ability to represent logical networks and capacity. These deficiencies are being addressed through revision of the model to include concepts such as topologies, but the history has resulted in poor utilisation of the model in certain telecom fields, such as inventory management. Principles Frameworx is based around these key principles. =Separation of Business Process from Component Implementation= When Operations Support Systems (OSSs) are linked together, the business processes they support become distributed across the IT estate. In effect the situation is reached where a process starts with application A, which processes some data and then knows that it must call application B, which also does some processing and then calls C, etc. The result of this is that it's extremely difficult to understand where any of these flows actually are (e.g. if the process flow is one intended to take a customer order, is it Application A or B or C that‚Äôs currently handling that order?) and it's even more difficult to change the process owing to its distributed nature. Frameworx proposes that the process is managed as part of the centralised infrastructure, using a workflow engine that is responsible for controlling the flow of the business process between the applications. Therefore, the workflow engine would initiate a process on application A, which would then return control to workflow engine, which would then call application B, and so on. In this way it's always possible to find out where an individual process flow is, since it is controlled by the central workflow engine, and process modifications can be made using the engine‚Äôs process definition tools. Clearly some lower level process flows will be embedded in the individual applications, but this should be below the level of business-significant processing (i.e. below the level at which business policy and rules are implemented). The Frameworx certification methodologies help us deal with the scope of preferences that are not linearly distributed as an opening to improve the customer accepted undeniably appropriate method. =Loosely Coupled Distributed System= \\"Loosely coupled\\" means that each application is relatively independent of the other applications in the overall system. Therefore, in a loosely coupled environment, one application can be altered without the alteration necessarily affecting others. Taken to extreme, this can sometimes be viewed as producing the ability to \\"plug and play\\" applications, where they are so independent that they can be changed without affecting the overall system behaviour. That extreme is considered an unlikely nirvana at the present time. The \\"distributed system\\" is emphasising that Frameworx is not based on a Communication Service Provider (CSP) using a single monolithic application to manage all its activities, but is instead using a set of integrated and co-operating applications. =Shared Information Model= Integrating OSSs means that data must be shared between the applications. For this to be effective, either each application must understand how every other application understands/interprets that part of the data that is shared, or there must be a common model of the shared data. To understand this, consider an order handling application which has gone through a process to enter a customer order and where it now needs to send out a bill using application B (a billing system). Application A will have a record of the customer address and it therefore needs to ensure that application B sends the bill to this address. Passing this data between the systems simply requires a common format for the address information ‚Äì each system needs to expect the same number of address lines, with each line being the same length. That‚Äôs fairly straightforward. But imagine the difficulty that would occur if the ordering application worked on products that consists of bundles of sub- products (e.g. a broadband access product made from a copper line, a modem, a set of filters and a broadband conversion), whereas the billing application only expected single product/order lines. Trying to convert hierarchical products into non-hierarchical ones without losing information would not be possible. A single information model for data that is shared between applications in this way provides a solution to this problem. The TMF solution to this is called the Shared Information/Data-Model (SID). =Common communications infrastructure= Through the mid-1980s, computer-based OSSs were developed as stand-alone applications. However, during the early 1990s it became apparent that employing these as purely isolated applications was highly inefficient, since it led to a situation where, for example, orders would be taken on one system but the details would then need to be re-keyed into another in order to configure the relevant network equipment. Major efficiency gains were shown to be available from linking the standalone OSSs together, to allow such features as \\"Flow-through provisioning\\", where an order could be placed online and automatically result in equipment being provisioned, without any human intervention. However, for large operators with many hundreds of separate OSSs, the proliferation of interfaces became a serious problem. Each OSS needed to \\"talk to\\" many others, leading to the number of interfaces increasing with the square of the number of OSSs. Frameworx describes the use of a Common Communications Infrastructure (CCI). In this model, OSSs interface with the CCI rather than directly with each other. The CCI thus allows applications to work together using the CCI to link them together. In this way, each application only requires one interface (to the CCI) rather than many (to other applications). The complexity is therefore reduced to one of order n, rather than n2. The CCI may also provide other services, including security, data translation, etc. =Contract defined interfaces = Given the description above of how applications interface to the CCI, it‚Äôs clear that we need a way of documenting those interfaces, both in terms of the technology employed (e.g. is it Java/JMS or Web services/SOAP?) but also the functionality of the application, the data used, the pre- and post-conditions, etc. The Frameworx contract specification provides a means to document these interfaces, and these are therefore contract defined interfaces. Frameworx contracts can be seen as extensions of Application Programming Interface (API) specifications. Deliverables =Process model= The eTOM (enhanced Telecom Operations Map, pronounced ee- tom) is the Frameworx business process framework. =Shared information model= The Frameworx Information is the Shared Information/Data Model (SID). =Lifecycle model= The Frameworx lifecycle model is aimed at defining the use and deployment of Frameworx within an organisation, and provides a framework for using the SID, eTOM and the Frameworx architecture. The model is based on considerable earlier work, including Zachman Framework, Kernighan, Yourdon, and the Object Management Group's Model Driven Architecture. The Frameworx lifecycle divides systems development into 4 stages: requirements, system design, implementation and operation. =Contract Specifications= As stated earlier, the Frameworx Contract is the fundamental unit of interoperability in a Frameworx system. Interoperability is important for each of the four views defined by the Frameworx Lifecycle. For example, the Contract is used to define the service to be delivered, as well as to specify information and code that implement the service. The Contract is also used to monitor, administer and maintain the service and ensure that any external obligations of the contract (e.g., from an SLA (Service Level Agreement)) are met and to define what measures to take if they are violated in some way. =Telecom Application Map= TAM The Applications Framework (formally Telecom Application Map (TAM)) is one of the primary Frameworx artifacts. It considers the role and the functionality of the various applications that deliver OSS (Operations Support System) and BSS (Business Support System) capability. In doing so it enables procurement documents to be written with reference to the framework, thereby providing clear unambiguous statements of the functionality required of any given application, functional overlaps of existing applications to be identified, thereby facilitating rationalization and functional gaps to be identified. The level of functional decomposition is such that these benefits can be realized but without being over prescriptive. Within the TM Forum there is a strong definition of process and data. The Applications Framework provides a formalized way of grouping together function and data into recognised components, which would then be regarded as potentially procurable as either applications or services. An application or service (for example: web services) can be a relatively coarsely grained software that implements functions/processes and acts on or uses data. In daily life we see applications such as word processors or mail clients; in OSS terms we would regard an application as something such as a CRM component, a billing system or an inventory solution ‚Äì although we also understand that these can be decomposed to some extent ‚Äì for example a billing system will include a number of smaller applications, such as a rating engine. An ‚Äúapplication‚Äù is defined as a set of one or more software artifacts comprising well defined functions, data, business flows, rules and interfaces. This would include a Data Model, for data used to interface to and within an application, policies, for governing external and internal application resources, a Flow Model, for functionality with the application and contract specifications for externally visible interfaces to the functionality within the application Applications are implementable as deployable packages and are procurable in the system market place. The Applications Framework is neither a part of the Information Framework or the Business Process Framework (eTOM) definitions but links to both in an easily understandable way and also provides a mapping between them.

It stars Madhavan, Soha Ali Khan, Irrfan Khan, Paresh Rawal and Kay Kay Menon. It deals with the aftermath of the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings, where 209 people lost their lives and over 700 were injured. It won multiple Filmfare Awards. Plot Rupali Joshi (Soha Ali Khan) is a successful reporter who is getting married in two months. Nikhil Agrawal (Madhavan) is an environmentally conscious executive who rides the train to work every day and is expecting his first child. Suresh (Kay Kay Menon) is a struggling computer tech who spends his time loafing at a local cafe and criticizing Muslims. Meanwhile, Sunil Kadam (Vijay Maurya) struggles with the corruption and inefficiency of the Mumbai police force and his boss, Tukaram Patil (Paresh Rawal), who is nearing retirement. On 11 July Nikhil and Suresh are in the second class compartment of a train when a bomb goes off in the first class compartment. The two survive, but Nikhil is too afraid to take the train again and is diagnosed with acute stress disorder. Suresh becomes obsessed with punishing the city's Muslims and is only stopped from antagonising them by Kadam and Patil on patrol. Kadam and Patil abuse a street vendor named Thomas (Irrfan Khan) who begins calling in fake bomb scares at malls to relieve his feelings. After an elderly man suffers a heart attack while the police are evacuating one mall, Thomas feels guilty and decides to stop. Rupali, who rushed to the scene of the bombings to cover the story, is devastated when she discovers that her fianc√© died in the blasts.

History On 9 December 2005, during an annual meeting of Mercosur in Montevideo, the presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil signed an accord for the construction of the pipeline. In June 2007 Petrobras president Jose Sergio Gabrielli said that the pipeline would not become operational for 20 to 30 years. In July 2007 Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez said that interest in building the pipeline had cooled. Route The exact route of the pipeline was never defined. It was only disclosed that the first section was to run from Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, through Rond√¥nia, Amazonas and Amap√° states in Brazil to Marab√°, Par√° state Brazil. In Manaus, Amazonas State, the pipeline was to be connected to the Urucu‚ÄìManaus pipeline and the Urucu-Porto Velho pipeline. From Marab√°, a branch line to Fortaleza, Cear√° State was foreseen. In Fortaleza the pipeline can be connected to the existing system that extends along the coast to Salvador, Bahia State to be connected with the GASENE pipeline. The second long section from Marab√° was to continue southward to S√£o Paulo State. From there, the pipeline was to be routed by the section to the border between Rio Grande do Sul State and Uruguay and then cross Uruguay to Argentina. Technical features The Puerto Ordaz-Marab√° section was planned to have a diameter and to have 13 compressor stations of 25,000 hp each. The diameter of the Marab√°-Fortaleza branch as planned would gradually decrease from to and the branch project involves the installation of five 15,000 hp compression stations. The gas amount received in Fortaleza was planned to be 12.75 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per annum. The Marab√°-S√£o Paulo section was to be in diameter and to include eight 20,000 hp compression stations. The gas delivered to S√£o Paulo was planned to be 15 bcm per annum. The Brazil-Argentina section with capacity of 18 bcm per annum was to include eight 15,000 hp compressor stations.

History  Eintracht Mahlsdorf was initially established in 1896 as a gymnastics club by local youth, but not formally registered until the following year. Football was popular within the club from its earliest days and a football department was organized in 1912 with the team was taking part in established local competition by 1916. World War I resulted in play being suspended in most parts of the country and not resumed until 1919. In 1923 many of Eintracht's footballers abandoned the lilac-and- white to play in the black-and-yellow of newly formed Adler Mahlsdorf. With the rise to power of the Nazis in the 1930s, many clubs, including Eintracht and Adler, were disbanded and their memberships organized into sports associations sanctioned by the regime. Following World War II the club played in the football competition that emerged in Soviet-occupied East Germany. Prior to the isolation of East Berlin from the rest of the city Mahlsdorf advanced past Hertha Zehlendorf and Spandauer SV to the quarter finals of the 1949 in Berlin Cup where they were put out by Berliner SV. Beginning in 1955 the side played as Medizin Lichtenberg as it was identified with the larger city district that included Mahlsdorf and, like other East German clubs, associated with a specific industry. The club was renamed Medizin Marzahn in 1982 ‚Äì once again for a larger city district ‚Äì and then in 1987 was dubbed Medizin Berlin 1896. After German reunification the club reclaimed its traditional name and registered as an independent entity on 3 June 1999. Following the merger of the football competitions of the two Germanys in 1991, Mahlsdorf played in the fourth tier Verbandsliga Berlin but was immediately relegated to the Landesliga Berlin (V) before slipping still further into local league play. The team eventually returned to the Landesliga and after a second-place result in 2002‚Äì03 made their way back to what was then the fifth tier Verbandsliga Berlin. Mahlsdorf currently play in the Berlin-Liga (VI) after being relegated in 2005 and then re-promoted in 2006.  Stadium  The club plays its home matches at the Sportplatz Am Rosenhag which has a capacity of 1,000.

Devil's Punchbowl is a tilted sandstone formation on the northern slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains, in Los Angeles County, California, at an elevation of . Park The Devils Punchbowl Natural Area is a Los Angeles County park, also within the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument and Angeles National Forest. It is located south of the Pearblossom Highway (CA Route 138), near the towns of Littlerock and Pearblossom. The Devil's Punchbowl Nature Center is operated by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. The center focuses on the flora, fauna, and geological features of the park, and the center offers school programs, parties, guided park tours, as well as telescope programs with an 11-inch telescope. The Bobcat Fire burned through the park in September 2020, destroying the nature center. The Devil's Chair at Devil's Punchbowl Park. = Trails = The Trail is within the park showcase the geologic features along the Punchbowl Formation and San Andreas Fault. There are connections to major longer trails leading to the high country in the National Monument. * Devil's Punchbowl Loop Trail is a 1 mile loop hike from the Nature Center that highlights important geological features. * Burkhart Trail is a lightly trafficked 13.7 mile route heading north from park. * The Devil's Chair Hike is a 7.5 mile round-trip hike to a perched viewpoint in Devil's Punchbowl. The Pacific Crest Trail also traverses the park on an endangered species detour to help protect the mountain yellow-legged frog.  Geology  The primary attractions of the park are its geological formations, including the Punchbowl Formation of the Neogene period. The Punchbowl is a deep canyon categorized as a plunging syncline: a v-shaped folding of the earth's strata caused by compression. The mountain peaks above the park are 8,000 feet in elevation, compared to the park's Nature Center at 4,740 feet above sea level. The Punchbowl Canyon is 300 feet deep at the vista point. The peculiar uptilted rock formations found in the area are layers of sedimentary rocks formed long ago by water depositing loose material in horizontal layers. Later they were squeezed into their present, steeply tilted form by ongoing uplift action along the Punchbowl and Pinyon Faults and by pressures along the San Andreas Fault. The Punchbowl Fault is to the south of the rock formation, while the Pinyon and San Andreas Faults are to the north.  Flora  Madrone tree, Devil's Punchbowl county park Driving into the park, beginning on the flats of the Antelope Valley, there is almost a complete absence of large shrubs or trees. The road then climbs into a belt of Joshua trees and California junipers. Entering the park boundaries, the Joshuas are left behind and replaced by Pinyon pine Woodland, with shrubs of the Desert Chaparral as an understory. The streambeds, both Punchbowl Creek at the bottom of the bowl and other watercourses in the Antelope Valley, have their own type of vegetation with cottonwoods, willows, and other plants that require more water. The next plant community above the park is the Coulter Pines and Yellow Pine Forest of the higher San Gabriel Mountains. Above these trees, White Firs are silhouetted against the sky on the high slopes and peaks.  Fauna  Many types of mammals live here but most are nocturnal and are seldom seen. Gray foxes may sometimes be seen in the early mornings or at dusk, and you may occasionally see deer crossing the road. Bighorn sheep, though rare, have been seen in the area, and chipmunks and California ground squirrels are active during most of the day. A few common birds are on display, and many additional species migrate through the area at various times of the year. The park's reptile and amphibian fauna represent a unique blend of types found in both deserts and mountains. Examples of some common local reptiles and amphibians are on display in the nature center on site. Rattlesnakes are also common but are wary of people and are rarely encountered. Insects and spiders are seasonally abundant. They may be seen on flowers and shrubs throughout the park, especially during the spring and summer. A representative collection of the various orders of insects is also on display.  Filming location  The German heavy metal band Accept filmed a video for their song \\"Stampede\\" at the location.

He wrote more than 50 books over 43 years between 1927 and 1969 ‚Äì an average of one book every 10 months, and twice published three books in one year (1932 and 1940). His first book was Madman's Island, published in 1927 at the age of 38, and his last was written at the age of 79. Called Challenge of the North, it told of Idriess's ideas for developing the north of Australia. Two of his works, The Cattle King (1936) and Flynn of the Inland (1932) had more than forty reprintings. Biography =Early years= Idriess was born in Waverley, a suburb of Sydney, to Juliette Windeyer (who had been born as Juliette Edmunds in 1865 at Binalong) and Walter Owen Idriess (a sheriff's officer born in 1862, who had emigrated from Dolgellau, in Wales). At birth Ion Idriess's name was registered as \\"Ion Windeyer\\", although he never seems to have used this name. From his late teens, he worked in rural New South Wales, particularly in the Narrabri and Moree districts. He travelled extensively around the state, working in a variety of itinerant jobs including employment as a rabbit poisoner, boundary rider, drover, prospecting for gold as well as harvesting sandalwood. He also worked as a shearer and dingo shooter. While working as an opal miner at Lightning Ridge in about 1910, he wrote short pieces for The Bulletin about life on the opal fields. He later headed north, working in several tin mines around Cairns and Cooktown including his own claim. In 1913 he moved to Cape York Peninsula, where he lived with an Aboriginal clan, learning their customs and lifestyle. =Military service= With the outbreak of war, in 1914 he returned to Townsville and enlisted in the 5th Light Horse Regiment, AIF, as a trooper. He saw action in Palestine, Sinai and Turkey, being wounded at Beersheba and Gallipoli ‚Äì where he acted as spotter for noted sniper Billy Sing. After returning to Australia and recuperating from his wounds, he travelled to remote Cape York, and worked with pearlers and missionaries in the Torres Strait islands and Papua New Guinea where he worked as a gold miner. Other ventures included buffalo shooting in the Northern Territory, and journeys to Central and Western Australia. =Career as a writer= In 1928 Idriess settled in Sydney where he wrote as a freelance writer. His writing style drew on his experiences as a soldier, prospector, and bushman. He wrote on a multitude of topics, including travel, recollection, biography, history, anthropology and his own ideas on possible future events. His books were generally non-fiction, but written in a narrative, story style. Most of his books were published by Angus & Robertson. Idriess wrote from real life experiences using knowledge he had personally gained by travelling extensively and working at a variety of occupations. \\"Idriess was no stylist, but his writing was immediate, colourful, well paced and, despite the speed at which it was written, always well structured.\\" Although he generally wrote under his name, some early articles for The Bulletin were written under the pseudonym of \\"Gouger\\". When travelling, Idriess was known as \\"Jack\\". In 1968 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to literature.It's an Honour Death and legacy Idriess died at a nursing home in Mona Vale in Sydney on 6 June 1979, at the age of 89. His work slipped from favour after his death, but has experienced a renewal of interest. As Nicolas Rothwell notes: \\"As so often in Australian letters, an initial fall into obscurity and the harsh judgments of the literary establishment serve as good indicators of a writer's pre- eminence\\".\\"Undeserved disdain for an engaging writer\\", Weekend Australian, 14-15 Jan 2017, Review, p. 15 His work was never adapted for the screen although several books were optioned by producers.

Horwill captained the Queensland Reds to a season victory in the 2011 in the Super Rugby competition, his sixth season played at that level Overall, Horwill played more than 129 times for the Queensland Reds, including 116 Super Rugby caps for the Reds. When his departure was announced the Queensland Rugby CEO Jim Carmichael described him as \\"one of the great modern-day sporting treasures of Queensland.\\" =Harlequins= On 17 December 2014, it was announced that Horwill had signed a three-year contract with English Premiership side Harlequins. He made his competitive debut in Quins' season opener against Wasps FC on 16 October 2015 and immediately established himself as a first choice in the team. He scored his debut points with a try in the match against Saracens F.C. on 9 January 2016. He has also captained the side in the absence of Quins' England players. International career Horwill in 2011 Horwill proved to be the find of the 2006 season, forcing his way into the starting line up and earning a place in the Wallabies spring tour, playing for Australia A in all three of the matches.

These claims have been picked up by anthropologist and linguist Roger Blench (1999).Roger Blench (1999) \\"Language phyla of the Indo-Pacific region: Recent research and classification\\", in Bellwood & Lilley, eds., Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association Bulletin, 18:59‚Äì76, Australian National University Morphological evidence The evidence for Karasuk is mostly in the verbal and nominal morphology. For example, the second-person singular prefixes on intransitive verbs are in Burushaski and in Ket. Ket has two verbal declensions, one prefixed with d- and one with b-, and Burushaski likewise has two, one prefixed with d- and one without such a marker. However, neither the Burushaski nor the Yeniseian verbal morphology has been rigorously analysed,Van Driem 2001:1146 and reviewers have found the evidence to be weak.Roland Bielmeier (review, 2003), \\"On the Languages of the Himalayas and their Links (nearly) around the World\\", EBHR 24:96 While Yeniseian has been proposed to be related to the Na-Dene languages of North America, as part of a newly named Dene‚ÄìYeniseian family, the relevant morphological correspondences between Na-Dene and Yeniseian have not been found in Burushaski.

He served as Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints from 1995 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998. Alberto Bovone was born in Frugarolo, and attended the seminary in Alessandria. Ordained to the priesthood on May 26, 1945, he then did pastoral work for a year before continuing his studies from 1946 until 1951 at the University of Turin and the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome (where he obtained his doctorate in canon law). Bovone entered the Roman Curia as an official of the Congregation for the Council in October 1951, and was later made Undersecretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on May 21, 1973. Pope John Paul II named him Titular Archbishop of Caesarea in Numidia on April 5, 1984, and Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three days later, on April 8. Bovone received his episcopal consecration on the following May 12 from Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, with Bishop Ferdinando Maggioni and Archbishop Luigi Dadaglio serving as co-consecrators. Bovone was the first person ordained as a Bishop by Ratzinger, who would become Pope Benedict XVI. As Secretary of the Doctrine of the Faith, he was the second-highest official of that dicastery, under Cardinal Ratzinger. In 1987, he helped write the instruction Donum Vitae on the respect for human life. Bovone was later appointed to head the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints on June 13, 1995. As he had yet to be raised to the College of Cardinals, he only held the title of Pro-Prefect of the congregation, until John Paul II created him Cardinal- Deacon of Ognissanti in Via Appia Nuova in the consistory of February 21, 1998, and Bovone became full Prefect of the Causes of the Saints two days later, on February 23. The Cardinal died in Rome two months later, at the age of 75. He is buried in his family's plot in Frugarolo.

The class also included , , and . The ships were the first ocean-going battleships built for the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). W√∂rth was laid down at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel in May 1890. The ship was launched on 6 August 1892 and commissioned into the fleet on 31 October 1893. W√∂rth and her three sisters carried six heavy guns rather than four, as was standard for most other navies' battleships. She was named for the Battle of W√∂rth fought during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. W√∂rth served in the German fleet for the first decade of her career, participating in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. She took part in the German naval expedition to China in 1900 to suppress the Boxer Rebellion; by the time the fleet arrived the siege of Peking had already been lifted, and W√∂rth saw little direct action in China. She was placed in reserve in 1906 as newer, more powerful vessels had supplanted the Brandenburg class as front-line battleships. Obsolete by the start of World War I, W√∂rth and Brandenburg served in a limited capacity in the Imperial German Navy as coastal defense ships for the first two years of the war; they did not see action. By 1916, W√∂rth was reduced to a barracks ship, a role in which she served until the end of hostilities. Despite plans to convert her into a freighter after the war, W√∂rth was scrapped in Danzig in 1919.  Design  alt=Line drawing for this type of ship; the vessel had three large gun turrets on the centerline and two thin smoke stacks. W√∂rth was the fourth of four s, the first pre-dreadnought battleships of the (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of Kaiser Wilhelm II to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and Leo von Caprivi, chief of the (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of coastal defense ships in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Alexander von Monts and instructed him to include four battleships in the 1889‚Äì1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the Tirpitz-era High Seas Fleet, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the (Young School). W√∂rth was long, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed, and up to at full combat load. She was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines that each drove a screw propeller. Steam was provided by twelve transverse cylindrical Scotch marine boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men. The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a broadside of six heavy guns in three twin gun turrets, rather than the four-gun main battery typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 inch) K L/40 guns, while the amidships turret mounted a pair of 28 cm (11 inch) guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight SK L/35 quick- firing guns mounted in casemates and eight 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick- firing guns, also casemate mounted. W√∂rths armament system was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. The main battery was heavier than that of other capital ships of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships. The ship was protected with compound armor. Her main belt armor was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery barbettes were protected with thick armor.  Service history  = Construction to 1895 = W√∂rth was ordered as battleship B, and was laid down at Germaniawerft in Kiel on 3 March 1890. Initial work on the ship proceeded at the slowest pace of all four vessels in the class; her hull was not launched until 6 August 1892, more than eight months after the other three ships. Princess Viktoria, the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II, christened the ship. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and she was commissioned on 31 October 1893, the first ship of the class to enter active duty. Extensive sea trials followed her commissioning and lasted until April 1894. During her trials, she was briefly assigned to the maneuver squadron of the (Home Fleet) to replace her sister , which was damaged by a boiler pipe explosion. On 1 August 1894, W√∂rth was assigned as the flagship of the German fleet for the annual autumn maneuvers, under the command of Admiral Max von der Goltz. Goltz came aboard the new battleship on 19 August with his staff, which included then-Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) Alfred von Tirpitz. Toward the end of the maneuvers, which took place in both the North and Baltic Seas, Kaiser Wilhelm II came aboard W√∂rth and reviewed a fleet parade on 21 September. W√∂rth in the Kiel Canal before 1901 During this period, W√∂rth was commanded by Prince Heinrich, the younger brother of Wilhelm II; the senior watch officer aboard the ship in 1894 was Franz von Hipper, who went on to command the German battlecruiser squadron during World War I and later the entire High Seas Fleet. On 1 November, Czar Alexander III of Russia died; Wilhelm II initially planned to send his brother to St. Petersburg to represent Germany at the funeral aboard his flagship. But General Bernhard Franz Wilhelm von Werder suggested that sending a warship named for the Battle of W√∂rth of the still-recent Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871 would antagonize the French delegation and would be unwise, given the recently signed Franco-Russian Alliance. Wilhelm II agreed, and so Prince Heinrich traveled to the funeral by train. After her sister entered service, she replaced W√∂rth as the fleet flagship. W√∂rth was thereafter assigned to I Division of I Squadron, in turn replacing the old ironclad . W√∂rth and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at Kiel on 3 December 1894. The squadron subsequently began a winter training cruise in the Baltic Sea; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet. In previous years, the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months. I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. Further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs. From 19 December to 27 March 1895, W√∂rth returned to her old duty as fleet flagship while Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm was in dock for repairs. The ship was occupied with individual and divisional training in early 1895. In May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic, concluding with a visit by the fleet to Kirkwall in Orkney. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in Kiel Bay in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony. On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise into the Atlantic; on the return voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the Isle of Wight for the Cowes Regatta. While there on 6 August, Wilhelm II held a remembrance ceremony for the 25th anniversary of W√∂rths namesake battle. This was sharply criticized in the British press. The fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the Helgoland Bight on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the torpedo boat capsized and sank in the storms‚Äîonly three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the Kattegat and the Great Belt. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of Pomerania and in Danzig Bay. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off Jersh√∂ft concluded the maneuvers on 14 September. = 1896‚Äì1900 = SMS W√∂rth in 1899 The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted through April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included a visit to the Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. The following month, Czar Nicholas II of Russia visited the fleet in Kiel, boarding W√∂rth on 8 September. The ship won the Kaiser's (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in I Squadron during 1896. W√∂rth and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. The ship represented Germany during the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in June 1897. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt; both divisions of I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, but they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men. The fleet followed the normal routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident. A voyage to the British Isles was also included. The fleet stopped in Queenstown, Greenock, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises. The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of Mecklenburg and a pitched battle with an \\"Eastern Fleet\\" in the Danzig Bay. While steaming back to Kiel, a severe storm hit the fleet, causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. In December, I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in Eckernf√∂rde Bay, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited Kungsbacka, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of I Division went into dock for their winter repairs. On 25 November 1899, W√∂rth was conducting gunnery training in Eckernf√∂rde Bay when she struck a rock. It tore a wide hole in the hull, flooding three of her watertight compartments. The ship was sent to Wilhelmshaven for repair work. Before repairs could be begun, about of coal had to be unloaded to lighten the ship. Temporary steel plates were riveted to cover the hole on the starboard side, while the hull plates on the port side had to be re-riveted. The work lasted from December 1899 until February 1900; she was therefore unavailable for the normal winter cruise of I Squadron. = Boxer Rebellion = During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in Peking and murdered Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the German minister. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the East Asia Squadron, which consisted of the protected cruisers , , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral Edward Seymour, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in Tientsin due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition would include W√∂rth and her three sisters, six cruisers, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of (General Field Marshal) Alfred von Waldersee. On 7 July, (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Richard von Gei√üler, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the Jade Bight, bound for China. They stopped to coal at Gibraltar on 17‚Äì18 July and passed through the Suez Canal on 26‚Äì27 July. More coal was taken on at Perim in the Red Sea, and on 2 August the fleet entered the Indian Ocean. On 10 August, the ships reached Colombo, Ceylon, and on 14 August they passed through the Strait of Malacca. They arrived in Singapore on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching Hong Kong on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer roadstead at Wusong, downriver from Shanghai. From there, W√∂rth was detached to cover the disembarkation of the German expeditionary corps outside the Taku Forts. By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. W√∂rth left Taku to coal at Tsingtau, the German naval base in China, and on 25 October returned to Wusong via Yantai. There, she joined the blockade of the Yangtze River. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; W√∂rth went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, when she moved to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. W√∂rth and the rest of the fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May. On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet to stop in Mah√©, Seychelles, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said. On 1 August they reached Cadiz, and then met with I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the Inspector General of the Navy. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks. = 1901‚Äì1914 = Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 Following her return from China, W√∂rth was taken into the drydocks at the (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul that lasted from 14 to 17 August. She then joined the fleet for autumn maneuvers. In the meantime, W√∂rth and her sisters, which had been assigned to I Division before their expedition to China, had been transferred to II Division of I Squadron following their return. On 24 November, W√∂rth was decommissioned for a major reconstruction at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven; she was the first member of her class to be modernized. During the modernization, a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure, along with a gangway. W√∂rth and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had their superstructure amidships reduced. The work lasted until December 1903. After her modernization, W√∂rth returned to service on 27 September 1904 assigned to II Squadron, where she replaced the old coastal defense ship . She served briefly as the flagship of KAdm Alfred Breusing from September until December, when she was replaced in that role by . On 16 February 1905, W√∂rth ran aground in the Kieler F√∂rde. She was pulled free two days later after enough coal and ammunition were thrown overboard to lighten the ship. She then steamed into Kiel and entered drydock, where her bottom was found to be slightly dented. A second accident occurred on 5 July, when the torpedo boat ran across W√∂rths bow. The battleship could not turn in time and rammed the torpedo boat, damaging it severely. One of S 124s boiler rooms flooded and the rush of steam from the boilers badly burned three men. On 4 July 1906, W√∂rth was transferred to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a maintenance staff. Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, KAdm Heinrich Sass. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the in Kiel to maintain her for future service. = World War I = Illustration of a Brandenburg-class battleship with torpedo boats in the foreground On 5 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, W√∂rth was assigned to V Battle Squadron under the command of VAdm Max von Grapow. The squadron was initially used for coastal defense in the North Sea. From 19 to 26 September, W√∂rth and the rest of V Squadron went on a sortie into the eastern Baltic but encountered no Russian forces. The ships subsequently returned to the North Sea and resumed their guard duties. W√∂rth was briefly transferred to VI Battle Squadron from 16 January to 25 February 1915 to strengthen the defenses of the Jade Bight and the mouth of the Weser. On 5 March, she was moved to Kiel, where her crew was reduced. After a short period of rest, her crew was restored and she and Brandenburg were transferred to Libau. She served as the flagship of KAdm Alfred Begas, the new commander of V Squadron. In Libau, they were assigned as guard ships in the recently conquered Russian harbor. The two old battleships were initially moored outside the harbor while it was cleared of wrecks. During this period, the ships prepared for an expected attack by the new Russian s, but the assault did not materialize. On 12 July, the crews of both ships were reduced again. On 15 January 1916, V Squadron was disbanded and Begas removed his flag from W√∂rth. She left Libau on 7 March and arrived in Neufahrwasser the following day. On 10 March she was decommissioned in Danzig to free her crew and guns for other uses. Some of her main battery guns were converted into \\"Kurf√ºrst\\" railroad guns; they were ready for service by early 1918. W√∂rth herself was employed as a barracks ship in Danzig until the end of the war in November 1918. Both W√∂rth and Brandenburg were struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping.

Career Guarnieri joined the George Hall orchestra in 1937. He is perhaps best known for his big band stints with Benny Goodman in 1939 and with Artie Shaw in 1940. Guarnieri is also noted for his embellishment and juxtaposition of jazz with classical piano, such as Scarlatti and Beethoven. Throughout the 1940s Guarnieri was a busy sideman, recording with artists such as Charlie Christian, Cozy Cole, Ike Quebec, Charlie Kennedy, Hank D'Amico and Ben Webster. He also led his own group called the \\"Johnny Guarnieri Swing Men\\" and recorded with them on the Savoy label, a group that included Lester Young, Hank D'Amico, Billy Butterfield and Cozy Cole. He also led a trio in the 1940s composed of himself, Slam Stewart and Sammy Weiss, recording again for Savoy. During the 1940s he also recorded for the short-lived Majestic label, playing solo piano and with his trio. In the 1940s he also played harpsichord in the Gramercy Five, a small band led by Artie Shaw; his solos were the first recorded on that instrument in jazz. On 1946 Guarnieri's trio was broadcast twice by the BBC Home Service in the UK in a short series highlighting American, British and French jazz artists dubbed as KINGS OF JAZZ. The Friday 18 January and Friday 29 March episodes featured his trio with Guarnieri (piano), Slam Stewart (bassI, and Sidney Catlett (drums), and was introduced by Alistair Cooke. In 1949 Guarnieri recorded an album with June Christy entitled June Christy & The Johnny Guarnieri Quintet. In his later years Guarnieri shifted more toward jazz education. In commemoration of his reputation as a teacher, Guarnieri's students financed a label for him called \\"Taz Jazz Records\\". In the 1970s Guarnieri recorded numerous albums on his new label, and until 1982 worked at the \\"Tail of the Cock\\" nightclub in Studio City, California. In the early 1980s, Guarnieri recorded Johnny Guarnieri Plays Duke Ellington on a B√∂sendorfer Grand \\"SE\\" player piano, for the Live-Performance Jazz Series.

He took the religious name of Clement, after Pope Saint Clement I, martyred in Chersonesos, who together with St Andrew the First-Called is considered to be the founder of Christianity in the Balkans. In 1913 he undertook theological studies in Innsbruck and on 28 August 1915 he was ordained a priest by the Bishop of Kri≈æevci, Croatia Dionisije Njaradi, while studied. After finishing them in 1919 returned to Ukraine to settle in the Holy Dormition Lavra in Peremyshliany Raion. Family coat of arms Sheptytsky of Blessed Clement Sheptytsky In 1926 Father Clement was named the hegumen (prior) of the Univ Lavra. In 1937 he came to Lviv to aide his ailing brother Andrew. In 1939 the region was occupied by communists, the Soviet \\"liberators\\" immediately implemented a plan to eliminate the Ukrainian intellectual elites and Church. At the time they did not arrest the Metropolitan himself, fearing his great authority among the nation, but went after his family attempting to capture Clement and murdering their brother Leon along with his family. During that time the Metropolitan divided the Soviet union into four exarchates and named Father Clement the exarch of Russia. World War II Univ Lavra In 1941 the persecution of Christians was interrupted with the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet war and the German occupation of Ukraine, however the situation did not improve much. During that time father Clement helped his brother Andrey Sheptytsky rescue Jews, harboring them in Studite monasteries and organizing groups that would aid them in escaping to Hungarian controlled Governorate of Subcarpathia. From 1941 to 1944, when the region was occupied by Nazi Germany, Jewish boys were hidden at the monastery in Univ, home to monks of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Univ was particularly important because it was the main Studite monastery; with its large community of monks, younger boys would go unnoticed by authorities. Along with the handful of holy men who were the children‚Äôs daily caretakers, three figures were instrumental in their safekeeping: Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, his brother Klymentiy, and Omelyan Kovch, a priest from the nearby town of Peremyshliany. Kurt I. Lewin, whose father was Lviv‚Äôs last rabbi and who would later become a renowned businessman, and David Kahane, later chief rabbi in the Israeli Air Force, were both harbored by Sheptytsky in Lviv. Later in their lives, both men would write about their experiences, Lewin in ‚ÄúA Journey Through Illusions‚Äù and Kahane in the ‚ÄúLvov Ghetto Diary.‚ÄùFeduschak, Natalia A., \\"Greek Catholic monastery recalls saving Jews in war\\", Kyiv Post, November 10, 2011 Clement Sheptytsky was recognized as one of the Righteous among the Nations by the State of Israel in 1995. Soviet persecution With the return of the Soviets in 1944 a coordinated action to destroy the Church and subject it to the Moscow Patriarchate was implemented. After the death of the Metropolitan, his successor, Joseph Slipyj, named Father Clement the Archimandrite of the Studite Order. This meant that at the time of the mass arrest of Church hierarchs carried out by the NKVD in 1945 he was one of the highest ranking clergymen left. As such he became an informal leader of the Church, meeting with monks and priests and strengthening them in their resolve. On 5 June 1947 he himself was arrested by Soviet authorities and held, first in an NKVD prison in Lviv, then in Kiev, and finally, after his steadfast refusal to renounce his faith and serve the Moscow Patriarchate, sentenced to eight years imprisonment. Ivan Kryvytskyi remembered Father Klymentiy as tall, rather thin, with a long white beard, a little stooped, with a cane. Arms relaxed, calm, face and eyes friendly. \\"He reminded me of Saint Nicholas ‚Ä¶ We never expected such a rascal in our room ‚Ä¶ Some sisters had passed three apples to him, real rosy red and ripe. And he gave one apple to Roman Novosad, who often had stomach problems. He said: 'You need to take care of your stomach,' and the others he divided among us.\\"\\"The Papal Visit to Ukraine, June 23 -27, 2001\\" Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church He died on May 1, 1951 in Vladimir Central Prison.

Career Grant started his career at non-League Tooting & Mitcham, before being signed by Gillingham. He later joined Millwall. He was then loaned out to Grays Athletic at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, scoring four times in 10 appearances in all competitions. During this time, he was under investigation for a killing related to the murder of which he was subsequently convicted, and the loan deal was cut short due to Grant breaking his curfew and being arrested again. He was later acquitted on those charges. Grant secured another loan deal, this time season-long to Grays on 24 August 2007, however it was cut short and he returned to the Lions in January 2008. He then joined Stevenage Borough on loan in February 2008. Grant was released by Millwall at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, and was signed by new Wycombe Wanderers boss Peter Taylor on a two-year contract. He was signed again by Taylor, by that time at Bradford City, on a non-contract basis on 26 February 2010. Conviction Grant was accused of killing Jahmall Moore in 2005, but was cleared of murder in 2007. However, on 23 July 2010, Grant was found guilty, along with Gareth Downie, of killing 21-year-old Leon Labastide in May 2004. The courts heard that both incidents were part of \\"tit-for-tat\\" shootings in the Stonebridge Park estate in Harlesden. He received a life sentence, subject to a minimum of 25 years in prison. On 31 October 2014, Grant was given right to appeal to conviction after three senior judges at the Court of Appeal had concerns over the 2010 trial as police failed to disclose important details about one of the key prosecution witnesses. However, the appeal was rejected in November 2015, the judges concluding that the evidence remained compelling.

Life Francisco de Paula de Almeida Brennand was born in Recife, Brazil, to Ricardo Monteiro Brennand and Ol√≠mpia Padilha Nunes Coimbra on June 11 1927. He was a descended from an Irish ancestor who migrated to Recife in 1820 and married into a sugar plantation family. His father, Ricardo Brennand, added ceramic tile and brick to the business in 1917, and sent his son Francisco to Europe to study technical ceramic skills. Arriving in Paris in 1949, Brennand discovered the ceramic work of Pable Picasso, Joan Mir√≥ and Fernand L√©ger, and become a ceramic artist. In 1948, he married D√©borah de Moura Vasconcelos. In 1971, Brennand returned to the ruins of his father's tile factory and set about turning it into what would become the Oficina Brennand, producing both tiles and his own ceramic sculpture. Brennand died of a respiratory infection on December 19, 2019, at the Real Hospital Portugu√™s in Recife, at the age of 92. The Governor of the state of Pernambuco declared a three-day period of mourning. Work Torre de Cristal, a tower by Francisco Brennand at the Sculptures Park in Recife Brennand primarily displayed his work at the Oficina Brennand, the compound encompassing the working tile factory, museum, chapel, and caf√©. The Oficina features around 2,000 of Brennand's pieces in enormous open halls, outdoor monuments, alters, chapels, and gardens, all in the midst of an Atlantic forest reserve in the Varzea neighborhood of Recife. His work often returns to themes of the human body, eggs, animals, and fruit. At times, he was forced to defend his work against charges that it was too provocative or erotic. The New York Times called Brennand \\"the foremost artist in the city\\" and the Oficina Brennand \\"a metaphor for the city of Recife itself, consumed in simultaneous growth and decay.\\" He has also been called \\"Brazil's greatest ceramicist.\\" More than 90 of his works, including the 32-meter Crystal Tower, can be seen at the Parque das esculturas (Sculptures Park), located in the Recife Antigo port district in Recife.

Together with the party's youth wing, the National League of Young Liberals (NLYL or Young Liberals), the organisations made up the Young Liberal Movement. In 1990, the two organisations themselves merged to form Liberal Democrat Youth and Students (LDYS). In Spring 2008, it was renamed Liberal Youth, and in December 2016 as Young Liberals.

In 1969 Jack Straw was elected to the NUS executive as a Radical Students Alliance candidate. The RSA was dominant in student politics until 1971 when the Broad Left (an alliance of Communists and Labour Students) came to prominence. During the 1970s ULS had little success in NUS National Executive elections with Francis Hayden (1975), Gavin Grant (1978) and Leighton Andrews(1979) being the only electoral successes as part-time Executive members. In 1979 ULS was one of the founders of the Left Alliance along with Communist, independent Labour (not in the National organisation of Labour Students) and independent members. 1980-82 was a period of Left Alliance leadership of NUS with David Aaronovitch as President of NUS and Jane Taylor as National Secretary. In 1982 John Murray was elected as a part-time Liberal/LA member of the NUS Executive along with Frank Howard (Labour/LA) and Kate Steele (Communist/LA).

He received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Peking of the Boxer Rebellion. He is known for saying \\"I'll try, Sir!\\" before scaling the walls of Peking. Biography Corporal Titus scaling the walls of Peking. Calvin Pearl Titus was the son of Calvin and Cora Smith Titus of Vinton, Iowa. He moved to Oklahoma with his father after his mother died, and later lived with his Aunt Florence and Uncle William (Bill) H. Lee, evangelists with first the Salvation Army and later the Pilgrim Holiness movement. Titus credited his time in his Uncle's evangelical band with giving him the bugle skills to join the armed forces and eventually leading him to Peking. Titus first joined the United States Army in May 1898, serving with the 1st Vermont Volunteer Infantry (although raised for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, this unit never left the United States). He joined the 14th Infantry Regiment in April 1899, serving in the Philippines and China. During the relief expedition to Peking in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, two companies of the 14th Infantry Regiment were pinned by heavy fire from the east wall of the Tartar City and the Fox Tower between abutments of the Chinese City Wall near Tung Pien Gate. Volunteers were called for to attempt the first perilous ascent of the wall. Titus immediately stepped forward saying, \\"I'll try, sir!\\" Using jagged holes in the stone wall, he succeeded in reaching the top. He was followed by the rest of his company, who climbed unarmed, and hauled up their rifles and ammunition belts by a rope made of rifle slings. As the troops ascended the wall, artillery fire set fire to the Fox Tower. For his courageous and daring deed in being the first to climb the wall, Titus was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was then appointed to West Point as a result of his award of the Medal of Honor, where President Theodore Roosevelt's presentation of his medal there on June 11, 1902, was the climax of a ceremony to celebrate the academy's centennial. He graduated with the West Point Class of 1905. His religious faith led him to try to become an army chaplain, but his denomination was not at that time recognized by the army. Instead, he rejoined his old regiment as a second lieutenant. Titus later served in the Mexican Expedition and with the U.S. occupation forces in Germany. He retired from the United States Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in October 1930.Service Profile In September 2016, Titus was honored with the painting of his image of the Benton County Freedom Rock, located in Shellsburg, Iowa.

From 1892 until her death in 1945, she was the wife of Stanley Baldwin, three-time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was invested as a Dame of Grace, Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and a Dame Grand Cross, Order of the British Empire, and styled as Countess Baldwin of Bewdley on 8 June 1937. Family She was born Lucy Ridsdale in Bayswater, London, the oldest daughter of Edward Lucas Jenks and Esther Lucy Ridsdale (n√©e Thacker). Known as \\"Cissie\\", she grew up with her sister and three brothers in the village in of Rottingdean, on the Sussex coast. Her brother Edward became a Member of Parliament for Brighton. She married Stanley Baldwin on 12 September 1892 in Rottingdean. Among the attendees were Stanley's aunt Alice and her son, Rudyard Kipling. The couple had seven children: *Unnamed son (stillborn January 1894) *Lady Diana Lucy (born 8 April 1895 ‚Äì 1982), married Capt Sir Richard Gordon Munro (divorced 1934) and Capt George Durant Kemp-Welch *Lady Leonora Stanley (10 July 1896 ‚Äì 1989), married Sir Arthur Howard *Lady Pamela Margaret (16 September 1897 ‚Äì 14 August 1976), married Sir Herbert Huntington-Whiteley, 2nd Baronet *Major Oliver Ridsdale Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1 March 1899 ‚Äì 10 August 1958) *Lady Esther Louisa Baldwin (16 March 1902 ‚Äì 1981) *Arthur Windham Baldwin, 3rd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (22 March 1904 ‚Äì 5 July 1976), married Sarah MacMurray James Interests and activities As a girl, she was a member of the White Heather Club, the first women's cricket club, founded in 1887 at Nun Appleton Hall near Appleton Roebuck, Yorkshire. It was on the field where she met her future husband. Apart from her home-making and raising of six children, she was also a formidable personality in her own right. She was very active and sociable, quite different from her husband in nature. Unlike her husband, she preferred the city life of London to the country. Their daughter Margaret Huntington-Whiteley said, \\"two people could not have been more unlike\\", but that \\"should they ever differ, it was always done quietly and politely.\\" They shared the same deep Christian faith and moral outlook, and she was very supportive and encouraging of her husband. She often travelled with her husband during his time as prime minister, and she was an excellent speaker who found her own voice in politics. She was involved in the Young Women's Christian Association and other charitable bodies for women, especially those concerned to improve maternity care, after having herself suffered difficult pregnancies and the loss of her first child. In 1928, she became vice-chairman of the newly established National Birthday Trust Fund to address the high incidence of maternal mortality. Its original aims were to support maternity hospitals and contribute to the development of midwifery practice. In 1929, she helped found the An√¶sthetics Appeal Fund with speeches, broadcasts and fund-raising. She was particularly concerned with reducing the pain of childbirth, and lobbied for new funds to make anaesthesia affordable for low-income women. Her work contributed to the passage of the Midwives Act 1936. Death Worcester Cathedral, grave of the 1st Earl Baldwin of Bewdley and his wife Lucy, n√©e Ridsdale She died suddenly of a heart attack in 1945 at Astley Hall, their country home in Worcestershire, She was cremated and her ashes were interred, with those of her husband, after his death in 1947 in the nave of Worcester Cathedral. Legacy In honour of her work for maternity care, philanthropist and cricket enthusiast Julien Cahn donated funds to build the Lucy Baldwin Maternity Hospital in Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire. It was commemorated by the prime minister on 16 April 1929, with a bronze dedication plaque over the main entrance reading . It expanded beyond maternity and became known as the Lucy Baldwin Hospital until its closure in 2006. In the 1960s, a new device that administered a combination of Nitrous oxide and oxygen for obstetrics, was named the Lucy Baldwin Apparatus For Obstetric Analgesia. Baldwin also wrote valuable notes of two major events in politics, the fall of the Lloyd George ministry and the Abdication Crisis.

Gaynor joined the team during the 1964 championship and became a regular member of the starting fifteen over the next decade. During that time he won three All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Gaynor is a three-time county club championship medallist with Kilruane MacDonagh's. In retirement from playing Gaynor became involved in team management and coaching. At inter-county level has served as manager of the Clare and Tipperary senior hurling teams. He has also had a wide-ranging coaching career with numerous club teams in Tipperary. Playing career =Club= Gaynor played his club hurling with his local Kilruane MacDonagh's club. He enjoyed some success at underage levels before later winning three consecutive senior county championship titles in 1977, 1978 and 1979. =Minor and under-21= By the early 1960s Gaynor had made an impact as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team. He tasted his first success in 1962 when he won a Munster minor medal. He later joined the Tipp under-21 panel with whom he won both Munster and All-Ireland medals in 1964 in the inaugural year of the competition. Gaynor won a second Munster under-21 medal in 1965. =Senior= Gaynor's skill at underage levels brought him to the attention of the senior selectors who elevated him onto the senior county team in 1964. He went on to win his first National Hurling League medal at the start of 1965, before Tipp demolished all opposition in the provincial championship giving him his first Munster title. Wexford were Tipp's opponents in the All-Ireland final, however, the game failed to live up to the two classic games between the two sides in 1960 and 1962. Victory went to Tipp on that occasion with Gaynor collecting his first All-Ireland medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 356 Tipp lost their provincial and All-Ireland crowns in spectacular fashion at the first hurdle in 1966 when a young Limerick team took them by surprise. The team bounced back in 1967 with Gaynor collecting a second Munster title. By this stage, however, Tipp's pool of players was ageing and the county's hurling fortunes were in decline. Kilkenny provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final and provided more than a match for Tipperary. Goals from Paddy Moran, Martin Brennan and Tom Walsh laid to rest a bogey that Tipperary had over Kilkenny since 1922.The GAA Book of Lists p. 356 Tipp crushed Cork in the provincial final again in 1968, giving Gaynor his third Munster title. For the fourth time that decade Tipperary faced Wexford in the championship decider, however, the Munster champions were now in terminal decline and surrendered an eight-point lead at half-time giving Wexford a 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì12 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 357 In 1971 Tipp defeated Limerick in the provincial decider, giving Gaynor a fourth Munster winners' medal. Kilkenny provided the opposition against Tipperary in that year's All-Ireland final. In the All-Ireland final to be broadcast in colour by Telfis √âireann, Tipp won on a score line of 5‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì14.The GAA Book of Lists p. 357 It was Gaynor's second All-Ireland medal. Gaynor retired from inter-county hurling in 1973. Managerial career In the early 1990s Gaynor served as manager of the Clare senior hurling team. He had some success by steering the county to two consecutive Munster final appearances in 1993 and 1994, however, these games ended in huge defeats for Clare. He was replaced in 1995 by Ger Loughnane. In 1997 Gaynor became manager of the Tipperary senior hurling team.

It is located at 492 Bellevue Avenue, Newport, Rhode Island, on the Atlantic coast of the United States. The design is loosely based on that of an 18th-century French mansion, Ch√¢teau d'Harou√©.The Ch√¢teau d'Harou√© by Germain Boffrand is often cited as an inspiration for Carr√®re & Hastings' plans for Vernon Court. Resemblances are limited to the prominent slate roof √† la fran√ßaise with small dormers, prominent chimneys and the segmental arch- headed fenestration. History Vernon Court was constructed in 1900 to be used as a summer cottage for the widow of Richard Augustine Gambrill, a New York lawyer, Anna Van Nest Gambrill (1865‚Äì1927). In addition to her husband's fortune, Anna Gambrill had inherited a substantial sum from her father, Alexander T. Van Nest, a railroad baron. Gambrill's sister, Jane and brother- in-law, Giraud Foster, had commissioned Carr√®re and Hastings a year earlier to design her estate near Lenox, Massachusetts, Bellefontaine (one of the Berkshire Cottages).Ossman, Laurie; Ewing, Heather (2011). Carr√®re and Hastings, The Masterworks. Rizzoli USA. . Although Carr√®re and Hastings typically considered the grounds and the architecture together as an ensemble, Gambrill hired her florists, the firm of Wadley & Smythe, as landscape architects for the property. They based their design for the primary garden loosely on the Pond Garden at Hampton Court PalaceGardens at Vernon Court In 1904, it was considered one of \\"the ten most beautiful mansions in America.\\"Berman, Ann E. \\"Newport News: An Illustration Museum Debuts in Rhode Island.\\" Architectural Digest, Dec. 1999: 76+.

It was developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment in conjunction with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and DC Comics. It is based on the 1997 film of the same name. Gameplay The game uses elements of a Sandbox style game, such as real-time events, traffic simulation and civilian population. The player can choose one of the film's three heroes, Batman, Robin or Batgirl. Each character uses a unique vehicle. Batman drives the Batmobile, Robin the Redbird motorcycle and Batgirl uses the Batblade. In the game, the player travels around Gotham City and completes various individual missions, such as preventing Mr. Freeze from robbing a bank. Most of the events are not triggered; instead, each event occurs at a certain time. For example, Mr. Freeze's bank robbery occurs at 7 p.m. The player must find clues and discover the plot with the help of the Batcomputer. If the player cannot find enough clues, the event occurs, failing the mission. Some situations are derived directly from the plot of the film, while others were conceived for the game. Development Acclaim originally scheduled Batman & Robin for release in the third quarter of 1997, in order to coincide with the film's theatrical release. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"We're going to be charitable and assume this was a game Acclaim was contractually obligated to release and quietly ignore it. While not in the same league as previous Acclaim licensed horrors, Batman and Robin is still pretty damn horrible.\\" Like the film, the PlayStation game was critically and commercially unsuccessful. IGN noted in their review, \\"In the end, you'll buy this game only if you're a Batman fanatic, not because it's a good game.\\" They rated it a five out of ten.Review for Playstation game , IGN.

It was founded in 1987 by Frank Cimino, and was designated by Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer as \\"Maryland's Official Goodwill Ambassadors\\". The choir is a donor-supported 501(c)3 organization that provides talented boys an opportunity to sing at a professional level while developing their self-esteem, self-discipline, and character. The choir is composed of approximately 150 choristers, ages 7 to 20, who come from a wide range of ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds. They perform locally, nationally, and internationally. The founder, Frank Cimino, is currently retired but still assists with the choir. Stephen Holmes is the Artistic Director, conducting and teaching the choir, along with Joseph Shortall, the Assistant Director. The Maryland State Boychoir provides an opportunity for boys of all backgrounds to come together and sing. The choir is divided into the following groupings, based on musical knowledge, voice part, and skill. Resident Training Choir The Resident Training Choir contains the newest and typically youngest members, learning the basics of reading music and music theory. Treble Choir The Treble Choir consists of younger boys who are relatively new to singing in an organized setting. Tour Choir The Tour Choir is composed of advanced singers of all ages, focusing on traditional chamber church music. They travel across the world to perform on three annual tours. Concert Choir The Concert Choir is the intermediate group, composed of all ages, which also tours extensively. Young Mens Chorus (Previously the Changed Voice Choir) This choir group consists of older boys with changed voices, drawing from both the Concert and Tour Choirs. Annual events Winter Camp The choir holds an annual winter camp over a long weekend to introduce the component choirs to the spring repertoire. Spring and Fall Tours The Concert Choir, Tour Choir, and Changed Voice Choir embark on short tours in the spring and fall. They typically sing at churches, schools, and retirement communities.

It is an extension of the more common seven-segment display, having an additional two diagonal or vertical segments (one between the top and the middle, and the other between the bottom and the horizontal segments). It provides an efficient method of displaying alphanumeric characters. The letters displayed by a nine-segment display are not consistently uppercase or lowercase in shape. A common compromise is to use a lower-case \\"n\\" instead of \\"N\\". Depending on the design of the display segments, the use of the extra two segments may be avoided whenever possible, as in the Nixxo X-Page 'tall' lowercase \\"r\\" and \\"y\\". Perhaps to avoid this awkward inconsistency, the Scope Geo N8T does not allow the use of uppercase or lowercase versions of the letters \\"J\\" (even though it could easily be displayed on a 7 segment display). Some other letters like \\"K\\", \\"Q\\", \\"W\\" (even though this would appear as an upside-down M), and \\"X\\", \\"Y\\" (even though it could easily be displayed on a 7 segment display), and \\"Z\\".  Uses  Representing numbers in Russian postcode. In some Russian digital calculators of the 1970s, such as the Elektronika 4-71b, 9-segment displays were used to provide basic alphanumerics and avoid confusions with representing numbers in Russian postcode. The extra two bars were slanted forward, allowing for an appropriate-looking –ò, and to differentiate the numeral 3 from the letter –ó. The Sharp Compet calculator also uses a 9-segment display, allowing a small range of characters and symbols to be used. Nine-segment displays are used in many Timex digital watches, and some pagers, such as the Nixxo XPage, the Arch BR502 pager, and the Scope Geo N8T. They are also used in some Epson Stylus printers, and Newport iSeries digital meters. The display used in the iSeries is unique in that it has a vertical extra segment at top, and a fully backwards-leaning slant for the extra segment at bottom. This allows for a somewhat more natural-appearing R and M. A nine-segment display has been developed for displaying Bengali and Roman numerals.

The term is used primarily in connection with travel over snow and ice, and was common during Arctic and Antarctic expeditions before the days of modern motorised traction. In the years following the end of the Napoleonic wars the British Royal Navy took up polar/cold climate exploration as its chief peacetime activity. Due to its simplicity, manhauling was adopted by the early British naval expeditions, where it quickly became the preferred even the 'traditional' technique. In time it would be hailed as inherently more noble than the sole use of dogs as practised by the native Arctic-dwelling peoples. The technique's chief advocate was Sir Clements Markham, President of the Royal Geographical Society during the latter part of the 19th century. A figure of considerable influence, he brought his prejudices to bear on the series of great British Antarctic ventures during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, in all of which manhauling was predominant. Many later writers would condemn manhauling, particularly with heavily loaded sledges, as inefficient and wasteful, citing it as a direct cause of the great Antarctic tragedy of 1910-12the deaths of Captain Scott and his four companions as they man-hauled their way across the Ross Ice Shelf on their return from the South Pole. Historical perspective =Naval tradition= Long before the nations of Europe and America became fascinated with polar exploration the native populations of Northern Canada, Greenland, Lapland and Siberia had trained dogs to draw sledges. Attempts by the early polar explorers to adopt these techniques were rarely successfulthe handling of ‚ÄúEskimo‚Äù dogs was recognised as a specialized art;Berton, p. 97 This led to the use of manhauling as a simpler alternative, when the Royal Navy began its long association with polar exploration. The first example of manhauling on a naval Arctic expedition was the journey by William Edward Parry across Melville Island in 1820, when he and his party dragged of equipment on a two-wheeled cart.Berton, p. 4 Thereafter man-hauling began to be seen as a natural, even a 'nobler' alternative to the use of dogs. Francis Leopold McClintock earned the title of \\"Father of Arctic Sledging\\" for his feats of manhauling travel during one of the many expeditions despatched to search for the missing Franklin expedition.Berton, p. 187 Among McClintock's admirers on that expedition was a 21-year-old midshipman, Clements MarkhamPreston, p. 15 =Markham‚Äôs obsession= Based on his experiences with McClintock and his love for naval traditions, Markham, future President of the Royal Geographical Society, became a fervent believer in the principle that manhauling was the purest form of polar travel.Jones, p. 58. Markham became the driving force behind British Antarctic exploration endeavours in the early 20th century, and was the mentor of Robert Falcon Scott, to whom his thinking and drive were transferred. After his unhappy experiences with dogs in the Antarctic on the Discovery Expedition, 1901-04 Scott wrote, in his account of the expedition: \\"In my mind no journey ever made with dogs can approach the height of that fine conception which is realised when a party of men go forth to face hardships, dangers, and difficulties with their own unaided efforts [‚Ä¶] Surely in this case the conquest is more nobly and splendidly won.\\"Scott: Voyage of the Discovery Vol I, p. 468. =Scott and Shackleton= An aversion to the use of dogs pervaded all the British expeditions during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration (including those led by Ernest Shackleton), This was baffling to the great Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen. To them manhauling was \\"futile toil\\", to be avoided at all costs.Huntford, p. 10. Edward Wilson, however, on the fatal southern journey during Scott's 1910‚Äì1913 Terra Nova Expedition expressed a profound relief, as the pole-bound party began its ascent of the Beardmore Glacier after the last of the poniesShackleton had pioneered the use of Siberian ponies as an alternative to dogs, on his Nimrod Expedition, 1907‚Äì1909. Scott had followed suit on his Terra Nova Expedition. Both these expeditions however, relied very heavily on manhauling. had been shot: \\"Thank God the horses are now done with, and we begin the heavier work ourselves\\", he wrote.Huntford, p. 432. His companion Lawrence Oates thought differently but kept his counsel. Later, when the Pole had been attained and Amundsen's prior arrival discovered, Oates privately castigated ‚Äúour wretched manhauling‚Äù as a cause of his party's defeat.Jones, p. 86. =Some conclusions= Some chroniclers have suggested that excessive reliance on manhauling may have cost the lives of Scott's polar party. Each man pulling a sledge was burning around 6,000 calories a day, and consuming rations producing only 4,500 calories. Max Jones concludes that they were slowly starving to death.Jones, p. 84 Much earlier, an expedition account by James Gordon Hayes had highlighted two principal causes of Scott's disaster: dietary deficiencies and the decision to rely on men instead of dogs.Quoted from Hayes‚Äôs book Antarctica (1928) by Jones, p. 84 In 1997, in another history of the expedition, Michael de-la-Noy concludes: ‚Äú‚Ä¶the whole expedition had been founded upon a blind and very British belief in the moral superiority of human muscle power‚Ä¶Scott thought it more manly for men to haul the sledges themselves. Five of them died as a result‚Äù.Quoted from de-la-Hoy‚Äôs book Scott of the Antarctic (1997) by Jones, p. 118 Notes and references Sources * Berton, Pierre: The Arctic Grail: The Quest for the Northwest Passage and the North Pole, 1818-1909 Viking Penguin Inc.

It is based in a building which spans a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej in Copenhagen's theatre district on the border between Vesterbro and Frederiksberg. With more than 12,000 m2 it is one of Denmark's largest theaters. It has two stages, the main auditorium which seats more than 1,000 and Sceneriet, a smaller theatre established in the cellar in 1994. History =Establishment= Franz ≈†ediv√Ω: The inauguration of the New Theatre on 10 September 1908 The site of the theatre, then a worn down apartment block, was in the spring of 1902 acquired by a development company, Bona, which had plans to build a large theatre and in the same time to open a passage between Gammel Kongevej and the new Vesterbro Passage, now part of Vesterbrogade, which was the backbone in a westward expansion of Copenhagen's city centre. Bona engaged Viggo Lindstr√∏m in the project as artistic consultant, he had been resident actor and director at Folketeatret but resigned after a fashionable controversy with its director, and in 1906 the company applied the Ministry of Justice for a license for the theatre's operation. The application was initially rejected by Peter Adler Alberti, the minister of Justice, supposedly due to a link with Folketeatret's director, but after personal intervention from King Frederik, the license was finally granted. In March 1907, Bona commissioned the architect Lorenz Gudme to draw up a project. He had previously worked for Ove Petersen, who was responsible for both the Royal Theatre, in collaboration with Vilhelm Dahlerup, and the Dagmar Theatre. His proposal was accepted and the fundaments were laid on 14 August 1907. Shortly after construction start, a disagreement occurred between Bona and Gudme who was ultimately fired from the project which was instead completed by Ludvig Andersen. When the theatre was inaugurated on 19 September 1908 it was the second largest theatre in the country and the construction price had been approx. DKK 1,200,000 and DKK 600,000 for the site. Poster from the opening in 1908 =Opening and early years= Lindstr√∏m, who also was the theatre's first director, had declared himself willing to set up everything at his new theatre, the second largest in Copenhagen, but the opening performance, Pierre Berton's Den sk√∏nne Marseillanerinde, an extravaganza about Napoleon with a young cast featuring such later stars as Poul Reumert, Asta Nielsen and Clara Wieth, became exemplar of the repertoire during the first three decades. Lindstr√∏m himself left the theatre after just three years due to an insignificant debts. He was succeeded in the post by the actor Ivar Schmidt (1869‚Äì1940) who held the post from 1911 to 1937, accompanied by actors such as Else-Marie, Berthe Qvistgaard, Ellen Gottschalch, Ib Sch√∏nberg and Osvald Helmuth. =Change of repertoire= The director from 1944 to 1966 was Peer Gregaard and he dramatically changed the repertoire from with a combination of classics and contemporary Danish and European drama. During this era, Det Ny Teater came to challenge the Royal Danish Theatre as the leading theatrical stage in Denmark. =Adversities and closure= In the 1960s it became evident that it was difficult to operate theatres without subsidies. The writer Knud Poulsen was appointed director in 1969 and by 1971 the theatre faced closure but was saved when the county and Ministry of Culture stepped in and compensated for reduced ticket prices. This marked the beginning of a crisis for the theatre which reflected the general adversities for the industry and, in 1976, led to the introduction of a general regime for subsidizing theatrical productions. In 1991, when the theatre, by then in a poor state of neglect, lost its support, it had to close indefinitely. =Reopening and recent years= The owners succeeded in raising funds for a thorough renovation. Bent Mejding was the driving force behind the restoration of the theater, which he and Niels-Bo Valbro reopened as a venue for operetta and musicals with a production of Die Fledermaus in 1994. Since then the theatre has produced a number of large productions, the most successful of which, artistically and audience-wise, has been Phantom of the Opera, which ran from 2000 to 2002. Building The fa√ßade from Vesterbrogade The theatre building spans a passage between Vesterbrogade and Gammel Kongevej and has a facade front on both sides. The complex also includes the surrounding buildings. The theatre is loosely modelled on the Paris Opera, but is built in a mixture of styles, combining elements such as classical trompe-l'≈ìil effects and Greek capitals side by side with art deco features. Roof-top sculpture group Built in reinforced concrete, it was the first building in Denmark to use the Hennebique system, due to added strength, allowed the theatre to be the first in Denmark to have balconies without supporting pillars. The theatre was also the first in Denmark to feature a revolving stage. Other state-of- the-art features were an advanced sprinkler system in case of fire on stage, showers installed for the actors on every floor. For the audience there were comfortable family boxes, an elegant marble staircase and a large inviting foyer. The renovation in 1994 received the Europa Nostra award from the European Union. Det Ny Teater today Since the renovation, the theatre has two stages. The large auditorium seats app. 1,000 while the small one, built in the cellar in connection with the 1994 renovation, seats an audience of 250 to 300. The main repertoire is still musicals. The theatre plays also host to a variety of other events and is available on hire.

After scoring 19 goals in his first season, the following year Lythgoe scored 46 goals in 39 league games, which is still a club record, including three consecutive hat-tricks in matches against Southport, Darlington and Wrexham and, after starting the 1934‚Äì35 season in similar fashion, Huddersfield Town paid ¬£3,500 to take him to Leeds Road in October 1934. He later returned to Stockport in 1938 where he finished his playing career. He died on 17 April 1967, aged 60.

Biography Gerundino was born in Almer√≠a, south-eastern Spain. At the age of 19, he began to learn to play the guitar from a friend to make a little money playing serenades. In this he was perhaps influenced by the environment of Almeria and by his father and grandfather who were musically inclined. His brother Eladio Fernandez used to play flamenco professionally and moved to Paris. His first guitar was made by copying a friend's guitar, having some manual skills from having been a cabinet maker or \\"carpintero\\". The guitar was extremely good and so, in 1958, he began to build guitars full- time, opening his own workshop in Almer√≠a in 1960. Experiments in guitar design, and years of pondering the matrix of elements that produce outstanding guitars, led him to develop what he considered to be a perfect design. Gerundino was a low-volume maker, producing perhaps 10-12 instruments each year. After his retirement in 1999, his workshop continued to put out a few instruments each year, although his personal input cannot be confirmed for these guitars. Guitars Gerundino instruments are known for their raspy growl and volume, well balanced intonation and \\"gutsy\\" percussive sound. His instruments are typically made of lightweight Cypress wood for back and sides, with either German Spruce or Western Red Cedar for the top. Occasionally, he would make \\"flamenco negra\\" guitars as well, with backs and sides of Indian Rosewood or Brazilian rosewood. These instruments begin to take on more of the tonal qualities of a Spanish classical guitar, although Gerundino's bracing system and construction maintain the essence of the flamenco sound. Players of his instruments include Paco Pe√±a, Paco de Lucia, Juan Martin, Tomatito and Eric Clapton. 1988 Gerundino won the 1st prize of acoustic in the world competition of luthiers sponsored by UNESCO in Paris. Clapton's 1976 Gerundino sold for $16,730 at his 2004 Christie's auction, believed to be the highest price ever paid for a Gerundino. Common to almost all flamenco guitars, Gerundinos have clear plastic \\"tap plates\\" or golpeadores, close to the sound hole, where the guitarist can strike his/her nails and knuckles to create the percussive effects which are essential to and idiosyncratic of flamenco guitar playing. In flamenco playing, the guitar acts as much as a rhythm instrument as a solo instrument. References *F.

It won Best Foreign Language Film at the 1996 Boston Society of Film Critics Awards. Plot Berthe, an elderly widow, is forced by her declining health to close the French farmhouse where she has spent much of her life. She moves in with her daughter √âmilie and son-in-law Bruno, who share a legal practice and have two grown children: Anne, a law student, and Lucien, who was adopted. In spite of √âmilie's efforts, Berthe is not happy in her daughter's bourgeois home in Blagnac. She sits by the swimming pool in the middle of the night talking to herself and finds the house pretentious. Worried about her mother's physical and mental health, √âmilie pays a visit to her unmarried younger brother, Antoine, a neurosurgeon. They have not seen each other for three years, since they quarreled at their father's funeral. √âmilie informs Antoine of their mother's condition and invites him to Christmas dinner with the family. On Christmas Eve, Antoine arrives at his sister's home as √âmilie, Bruno and Anne are leaving for midnight mass. Antoine urges himself not to get carried away and spoil the evening. As he wanders through the house looking for his mother, he surprises Lucien, who works at a nightclub in town, making out with Khadija, √âmilie and Bruno's Moroccan secretary, who has been invited to spend Christmas with the family. Antoine promises not to tell anything. When he finds his mother's room, Berthe is delighted to see him, but complains about living with √âmilie. She dislikes Bruno, has no affection for the grandchildren and does not value √âmilie's efforts to put her at ease. Dinner is lively, but after the youngsters leave for Lucien's room, tempers flare between Bruno and Antoine and they exchange blows. Antoine leaves with a bloody nose and Berthe departs with him. Talking later with Bruno, √âmilie says she loathes what they have become. Anne is distraught by the family's dispute and looks to Khadija for solace. Berthe returns to live alone at her farm but suffers a stroke. This forces √âmilie to visit her brother once again. Antoine has moved to a small apartment in Toulouse. He is glad to learn that √âmilie has separated from Bruno. The siblings agree to place their mother in a nursing home. They pick up Berthe and on the drive they remember old times. When √âmilie and Antoine sing as they used to when they were children, Berthe cheers up. On a stop during the trip, Antoine fulfills a childhood dream and goes skinny- dipping in a river. Berthe introduces her children to the director of the retirement home. She took good care of her children and they are now two very successful professionals who are too busy to take care of her, she says bitterly. Pressured by her brother, √âmilie spends the night at Antoine's apartment. He gives her a drug to help her sleep and joins Khadija and Anne at the bar where Lucien works. Anne has now given up her law studies and works in a music shop. Lucien and Khadija have a rocky relationship. Antoine tries to rekindle the childhood closeness he enjoyed with his sister. When Antoine and √âmilie visit their mother at the retirement home, her physical and mental health have greatly deteriorated. She says she wishes she had had a third child because that child would have taken care of her. √âmilie and Antoine remove their mother from the nursing home. An exam at the hospital where Antoine works confirms their suspicion that Berthe is in her final decline. √âmilie moves back to her house at Blagnac. Antoine breaks into the house to talk to her, and they have an argument. They recriminate each other about their behavior toward their mother. Feeling guilty, Antoine makes a halfhearted attempt to commit suicide, jumping from the balcony of his apartment and breaking a leg. Berthe dies alone at the hospital. After the funeral, Antoine, √âmilie, Bruno, Lucien, Anne and Khadija meet at the house in Blagnac and have breakfast outdoors. During the conversation Anne asks the others which is their favorite season since she does not have one. Before Antoine's departure √âmilie recites a poem she learned as a song as a child. She used to sing it while waiting at school for the holidays to be reunited with Antoine.

History The grammar school was created at some time before 1585 (the date of a donation being made by a Richard Searle \\"to the maintenance of the school in Farnham\\").History of Farnham College - Farnham College website The first evidence that the school was built is a record in 1585 of a yeoman in Farnham donating 20 shillings 'to the maintenance of the school of Farnham'. It is, though, possible that this ancient school dated back as far as 1351 when a chantry was created at Farnham Castle, but there is no documentary evidence of this. The school benefited over the years from bequests by different people as well as the generosity of Bishops of Winchester who occupied Farnham Castle over the centuries. New building The school was housed in West Street, Farnham until 1906. It moved then because in the previous year, the town centre assets were sold in order to purchase and build a new school in fields to the south of the town. Dissolution In 1973, under Government education reforms, the school merged with Farnham Girls' Grammar School to form Farnham College.

An outfielder and first baseman, he played the last five seasons of his 11-year professional career after being diagnosed with leukemia while serving in the United States ArmyAnderson, James, Walter Bond, The Texas Baseball Hall of Fame (tbhof.com) in 1962. The disease finally took Bond's life in the closing weeks of the baseball season ‚Äî a year during which he had made the Twins' roster coming out of spring training. The native of Denmark, Tennessee, attended Lane College; he stood tall and weighed , threw right-handed and batted left-handed. With his imposing size, he was an effective power hitter who also batted for average (.299) during his minor league career, and brief Negro leagues career with the Kansas City Monarchs. In 1962, the year of his diagnosis, Bond batted .320 in 132 games for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference Then, in a 12-game September stint with the Indians, Bond hit six home runs in only 50 at bats, drove in 17 runs, batted .380 and slugged .800. Yet he could not make the 1963 Indians roster and spent that campaign in Triple-A. On December 19, 1963, he was acquired by Houston. The Colt .45s' general manager, Paul Richards, was aware of Bond's illness, but the team doctor examined Bond and determined that the leukemia was in remission. Bond then turned in his best Major League season as the starting first baseman for the 1964 Colt .45s, leading Houston in home runs (20) and runs batted in (85), and appearing in 148 games. The following year, Bond held onto his starting job, but his production slumped with the team's move into the Astrodome; some teammates later speculated that his leukemia had recurred that season, affecting his play. Sent to the Twins just before the season, he returned to Triple-A and batted .316 with 18 home runs in 122 games for the Denver Bears, earning an invitation to spring training for 1967. Bond made the team and batted .313 in part-time duty during the season's first month. But the Twins released him on May 15, and although Bond caught on with the Jacksonville Suns, his declining health forced him to the sidelines after only three games. He entered a Houston hospital for treatment, but died there at age 29.Walt Bond dies at 29 Said his physician, Dr. Hatch Cummings: \\"He showed the strength of character and will that only champions possess. It was an exhibition of courage, and in the best tradition of baseball.\\" Bond's 307 big-league hits included 40 doubles, 11 triples and 41 homers.

She was one of the first four women to be admitted as Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in the first year of admission, and was admitted Fellow of the Linnean Society in the second year of women's admission. In 1921 she was the first woman to be President of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia.  Early life  Nina Layard was born on August 20, 1853 in Essex to Charles Clement and Sarah Layard. She was interested in natural history from a young age and was an enthusiastic collector of eggs and shells as a child. While her only formal education consisted of attendance at a dame-school in Willesden, Middlesex, over the course of her life, she was encouraged in the pursuit of her passions by a number of scholars, including Leonard Jenyns and John Ellor Taylor.  Archaeological work  Remarkably for the time, Layard directed multiple archaeological excavations. Her first, in 1898, was the Blackfriars monastery, Ipswich. Here she succeeded in locating the foundations walls of the medieval buildings. From 1902-05, she conducted excavations at the paleolithic site of Foxhall Road (Ipswich), arguably her most important contribution to the disciplines of archaeology and prehistory. Layard's work at Foxhall Road provided important evidence for the antiquity of humans (existence before the Ice Age), and her analysis of the stone tools discovered there enhanced understandings of the process of stone tool manufacture. In 1906-07, she excavated the Hadleigh Road site (Ipswich), an Anglo-Saxon cemetery under threat from a road-expansion project. Her work here documented 159 graves and their grave goods. The objects recovered were sent to the Ipswich Museum and her work on the site was published by the Society of Antiquaries (London), although as a women, she herself was not allowed entry into the Society.  Family connections  Nina Layard was the fourth child of Charles Clement Layard and his wife Sarah, n√©e Somes. Her father was first cousin (on his father's side) of Sir Austen Henry Layard (excavator of Nineveh and Nimrud), Edgar Leopold Layard (Curator of the South African Museum at Cape Town, and Governor of Fiji), and of Lady Charlotte Guest (translator of the Mabinogion and collector of ceramics). Nina's grandfather Brownlow Villiers Layard was aide-de-camp and afterwards (1802) private chaplain to the Duke of Kent (and brother of the Governors of Malta and Cura√ßao and of Lady Lindsey), and was the son of a Dean of Bristol and grandson of the accoucheur Daniel Peter Layard. C. C. Layard was also first cousin (on his mother's side) of Lady Llanover (of the Welsh cultural revival), being the son of Louisa Port, sister of Georgiana (favoured grandniece of Mrs Delany and companion of Fanny Burney), and therefore a descendant of Bernard Granville of Calwich and of Sir Richard Grenville of 'The Revenge'. Nina Layard's mother Sarah Somes was sister of Samuel Somes and the MP, Joseph Somes. In the 1830s her brothers were the largest ship-owners in London and held contracts for convict shipping to Australia. Nina Layard was a sister of the essayist and litterateur George Somes Layard, and therefore the aunt of John Willoughby Layard, psychologist and anthropologist. References  Sources  * S.J.

The Club is one of the longest established sides in Galway. Milltown are a Gaelic football club. Twice winners of the Galway Senior Football Championship, Milltown made their first appearance in a county final in 20 years when they faced Killererin at Pearse Stadium in 2007, but were defeated by a scoreline of 1-09 to 0-10. Former Texaco Footballer of the Year, Noel Tierney, one of the greatest full backs in Gaelic football history and a key member of Galway's historic \\"3 In A Row\\" team is one of Milltown's best known players. Two Milltown players were part of the Galway Under 21 All-Ireland winning squad in 2002: Diarmaid Blake and John Devane. This success was followed by three more Milltown players who were part of the Galway Under 21 All-Ireland winning squad in 2005: Darren Mullahy, Matthew Flannery and Cathal Blake. In 2011, Mark Hehir won an All-Ireland medal as part of the victorious Galway Under 21 squad. Milltown has always been known for its great underage work and in 2008 the club was awarded a Special Achievement Award by Galway county board. This was presented to Padraic Kirrane (Juvenile Chairperson) and P√°draig Coyne (Juvenile Secretary). Milltown is the second longest senior football team in Galway after Tuam Stars. History The oldest record of a Milltown GAA Club dates back as far as 1888 when Milltown John O'Keanes (named after the famous local man who was forced to leave his native country on a Fenian emigrant ship in the late 1860s) played Dunmore McHales on 6 April, defeating them 0-4 to 0-1. By 1901 there was a new club in existence, Milltown Erin's Hope. In a report of a match played on 17 August the Milltown side beat Tuam Emeralds 2-3 to 2-0. It also says that an unnamed Milltown captain called for the Harp for Erin as the referee conducted the toss-up leading to the newly named club. It wasn't until 1953 that the club was re-established, originally called Milltown St. Malachy's. The first team to represent the newly founded club was a junior side that played Kilconly on 12 April 1953, however Kilconly won the game 2-3 to 0-3. On 17 May however, in their second match, they defeated Cortoon Shamrocks in a league game 3-6 to 0-3 at Brownesgrove. In 1953 they won their first trophy when they beat Ahascragh 1-7 to 2-1 in the Galway Junior North Board Championship Final Replay ( Drawing the first match with seven points each ), however they were stripped of their title and suspended for 12 months for fielding an illegal player, a Co. Longford man who worked as a barman in a pub in Vicar Street, Tuam. It wasn't until 1961 that Milltown won their first Galway Junior County Championship making history having to win it twice. After winning the North Board final they went straight through to the County final defeating St. Grellan's, Ballinasloe by 6-8 to 1-2. They didn't play a semi- final as the opposition, Clonbur weren't able to field a team but after an objection, they were given a refixture which Milltown won by 0-10 to 0-2 on New Years Day 1962. This became the first GAA result to be announced on the new RT√â television channel which was opened that same day. Ten years later in 1971, they won their first Galway Senior Football Championship with only a panel of 17 men. They defeated Ballinasloe on a scoreline of 0-4 to 0-5 on 10 October in Tuam Stadium, led by captain Sean Brennan. Milltown would go on to reach the Connacht Senior Club Football Championship final that year, however; they were defeated by Claremorris. A decade later, they won their second and last Senior County Championship, again beating Ballinasloe, with a scoreline of 0-11 to 2-3 on 22 November 1981 in Tuam Stadium. John Hehir captained the victorious team.

She was introduced in 1998 by head writer Sally Sussman Morina, and executive producer Ken Corday. Actress Arianne Zucker has portrayed the character since her introduction to the series in 1998. In 2006, Zucker left the soap in pursuit of other acting possibilities. She returned to the role in 2008. In 2016, Zucker also appeared as Helena Tasso, a deceased woman who bears a resemblance to Nicole, in flashbacks. In March 2017, Zucker announced she would once again leave the role. She made her final appearance in the role on October 20, 2017. Following her departure, media outlets began to report that Zucker was to reprise the role for a short-term visit in December 2017 after being spotted on-set; Zucker explained her visit, stating that her daughter was included in the annual telling of the Christmas Story at the University Hospital. In June 2018, it was announced that Zucker would reprise the role of Nicole later the same year. She appeared for a few weeks in October 2018. Zucker later returned in April 2019, but as Kristen DiMera, who was posing as Nicole. Zucker then returned to the role of Nicole in September 2019. Many of Nicole's storylines have often focused on treachery, death, and love, with the character being portrayed as always in pursuit of finding true love and having the family she never had as a child growing up. The character is the daughter of Fay Walker and Paul Mendez. During her childhood, Nicole was a victim of child sexual abuse at the hands of her father, Paul, who forced her to do pornography in her adolescence under the name \\"Misty Circle\\". The character came to Salem as a small town waitress, but almost immediately started getting involved with the major families that the show revolved around. While once being seen as a scheming gold-digger, Nicole has grown into a woman committed to finding love and being a good mother. She is known for her longstanding feud with her enemy, Sami Brady, her relationships with Eric Brady, Victor Kiriakis, Brady Black and EJ DiMera, and the 2009 Baby Switch story line which featured Nicole having a miscarriage; lying to her husband; and stealing Sami's baby, Sydney. Zucker's performance in the role has been met with favorable reception from audiences and critics, having garnered her two nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2010 and 2013. In 2014 and 2020, she ascended and received her third and fourth Daytime Emmy nominations in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category.  Storylines  = 1998‚Äì2006 = Overworked and underpaid waitress Nicole comes to Salem with dreams of becoming a model and meets Eric Brady (Jensen Ackles). Eric convinces his sister Sami (Alison Sweeney) to give Nicole a modeling contract landing Nicole on the cover of Bella magazine. Despite her success, Nicole seems to be hiding something. It is eventually revealed that Nicole is being followed by her ex- boyfriend, Jay. As Eric and Nicole fall in love, a jealous Jay threatens to tell Nicole's secrets. Nicole develops friendships with Sami and Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow), even planning out Sami's bachelorette party. Kate's son and Sami's ex-boyfriend Lucas (Bryan Dattilo) starts showering Nicole with gifts despite his mother's disapproval; Lucas wants to use Nicole to get custody of his son Will from Sami. Meanwhile, Nicole's sister, Taylor Raines (Katherine Ellis) comes to Salem and befriends Eric and Lucas uses the relationship to keep Nicole and Eric apart so he can have her for himself. Taylor catches on to Lucas's schemes and skips town while Nicole agrees to marriage in exchange for $5 million leaving Eric devastated and running him out of town. When Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) takes the money away from her, Nicole decides to help Sami regain custody of Will. Also, a brief cancer scare forces Nicole to realize the error of her ways. She shares a brief reunion with Eric and divorces Lucas. However, Eric helps Nicole open up about her troubled past and being forced into porn as a teenager by her father, Paul Mendez. Nicole cozies up to Victor by exposing Kate's plot to kill him and also uses his grandson Brady Black (Kyle Lowder) in her schemes. Victor and Nicole eventually marry on New Year's Eve in 2002 only for Nicole to fake his death with the help of Jan Spears (Heather Lauren Olson), leaving Nicole as the wealthy grieving widow who has fallen for her step grandson. However, Nicole's plans begin to unravel when Victor is discovered alive. Meanwhile, in an effort to keep Brady for herself, Nicole tries to disfigure his presumed dead first love, Chloe Lane (Nadia Bjorlin) during surgery with help from Stan (Dan Wells) and Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis). Nicole learns that Stan is actually Sami in disguise and threatens to expose her. However, Sami exposes Nicole's schemes instead and Brady kicks her out of his life believing she was behind Chloe's \\"death.\\" Nicole later goes into business with Sami and Austin Reed (Austin Peck). In 2006, she agrees to move to Los Angeles to manage the newly acquired branch of the company. Before leaving town, Nicole has a one-night stand with Sami's father, Roman Brady (Josh Taylor). After her departure, it is mentioned that Nicole had plans to marry \\"some soap actor.\\" This was presumably a nod to Zucker's marriage to her former Days of Our Lives costar, Kyle Lowder, who played Brady. = 2008‚Äìpresent = Nicole resurfaces in 2008 and announces that she and Victor are still legally married. Nicole hires EJ DiMera (James Scott) to help her with the divorce only for Nicole to discover that she is still married to her first husband, Trent Robbins (Roscoe Born), making her subsequent marriages to Lucas and Victor invalid. Nicole had married Trent when she was in college but she left him because he was abusive; however, she never filed for divorce. EJ starts using Nicole to make his soon to be ex-wife Sami jealous and after Sami dumps him, EJ and Nicole end up having sex in an elevator. Nicole is a prime suspect when Trent is found dead in September 2008, but she is exonerated. Nicole later discovers she is pregnant, and knowing she was not supposed to have children, Nicole considers the child to be a \\"miracle.\\" EJ and Nicole move in together only for her to miscarry. Realizing that EJ loved their baby and not her, Nicole fakes her pregnancy fearing he will leave her. Nicole discovers that EJ is still in love with Sami, so she adopts Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler)'s baby with help from Dr. Richard Baker (John Callahan) and passes the child off as her own. To make matters worse, Nicole switches Mia's child with Sami and EJ's baby allowing EJ to raise the child even though Sami planned to keep him from the child. Nicole names the child, Sydney only for her lies to be exposed when the child's father, Chad Peterson-Woods (Casey Deidrick) tries to sue for custody. Nicole is sent to prison for her crimes and later released with the help of Anna DiMera (Leann Hunley). Seeing that Nicole is still attached to Sydney, EJ arranges for her to be a part of Sydney's life and live in the mansion leading him to propose to her in order for Nicole to be a \\"mother figure\\" to EJ's children. Nicole accepts leading her to start falling in love with him again. On their wedding day, EJ meets Nicole's sister Taylor (Natalia Livingston) and it is love at first sight. After weeks of cheating, EJ asks Nicole for a divorce and she is left shattered. Nicole is employed as EJ's secretary and they start working together for EJ to win the election and become Mayor of Salem. During the election their romantic relationship evolves but Nicole holds back fearing that EJ will end up hurting her again. When he proposes to her in February 2012, Nicole accepts only to find out that EJ had cheated on her once again with Sami. She storms out of the mansion and goes to the Town Square where she meets Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian). During their talk Nicole faints and Daniel takes her to the hospital only to find out that Nicole is pregnant. Nicole worries about her pregnancy ending up in a miscarriage again and wanting to get away from EJ she hides her pregnancy from him with the help of Daniel and Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering). EJ finds out that Nicole is pregnant and Rafe steps in claiming the child is his leading him and Nicole to fabricate this story to keep the baby from EJ. In May 2012, Nicole stresses over EJ and starts having pains in her stomach but gets to the hospital in time and everything turns out to be fine. Nicole begins a romantic relationship with Daniel but due to his daughter's priorities at the time, he broke it off. In August 2012, an earthquake hits Salem and Nicole goes into preterm labor but luckily enough Daniel manages to stop the contractions and keep the pregnancy healthy. She then starts a rivalry with Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves) fearing that Daniel will get back together with Jenn. In October 2012 and at 37 weeks pregnant, Nicole goes to her prenatal visit but her doctor informs her that her baby is dead. A distraught Nicole grieves her second loss but does not tell Daniel fearing that he will get back together with Jenn seeing there is no baby. That same day Nicole gets into a fight with Jennifer on the stairs of the Town Square and Nicole falls down going into labor. Nicole gives birth to her stillborn son and seeing the opportunity she blames Jennifer in pushing her. A month later the truth comes out and seeing she is left with nothing, she tries to commit suicide but Rafe and Daniel step in just in time to stop her. Nicole's first love, Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan), returns to Salem as a priest. He offers her a job as his secretary at the church, which Nicole accepts. As the two continue working together, Nicole's old feelings for Eric resurface. Knowing that he is a priest and cannot be with her, Nicole aches about not being with him. In June 2013, Eric is drugged and seduced by Kristen DiMera. Due to coincidences that happened that night, such as Nicole finding a delirious Eric in his hotel room shortly after Kristen leaves, Eric is led to believe that it was Nicole who raped him. He confronts her about the matter. While Nicole admits her feelings towards him during the confrontation, she repeatedly denies any wrongdoing. Eric does not believe her, concluding that Nicole acted on her feelings. Dismayed by Eric's false accusation, Nicole does not want to have anything to do with Eric. After Eric is suspended from the priesthood due to the sex scandal, Nicole forgives him, and together with Daniel, they work together to prove Eric's innocence. Knowing that Eric would deny her help due to her feelings for him, Nicole fabricates a fake romance with Daniel, assuring Eric she is over him. The lie shocks both Daniel and Eric. Daniel is initially reluctant at first, as Nicole had made up the lie before informing him, but he agrees to play along, blindsiding Eric. Since finding out about Nicole's new romance, Eric begins to have dreams about Nicole and is unsure how he feels about her. As Nicole and Eric begin spending more time together to clear his name, Eric's old feelings for Nicole resurface. This becomes especially apparent after Nicole's photo shoot, when Eric reminisces about an old photo shoot with Nicole during her modeling days with Countess Wilhelmina. Nicole and Eric's relationship becomes more mutual, leaving both of them confused and unsure how to react. On January 13, 2014, Nicole and Eric are kidnapped by Kristen's potion doctor, as the two have gotten too close to the truth about the night Eric was drugged. The doctor tied them together in the basement of Daniel's apartment complex. He initially was going to wipe their memories with his drugs, but instead opens a gas line in the basement and leaves Nicole and Eric to die, either by asphyxiation or an eventual explosion. It is in this dire situation Eric confesses he loves Nicole. She was engaged to Eric briefly but they broke up and now she is currently engaged to Daniel. Sadly, on New Year's Eve of 2015, Brady, his stepbrother Eric, Jennifer Horton, and Daniel are involved in a tragic car accident due to Eric driving drunk. The accident leaves Daniel brain dead, and Brady in need of a heart transplant. With Maggie's permission, Daniel is taken off of life support and his heart is donated to Brady. Eric is later sent to prison for causing Daniel's death, leaving Nicole heartbroken. In 2016, Chloe Lane attempts a second surrogacy for Nicole after a failed first attempt. In a snowstorm with Chloe, Nicole unknowingly delivers her own child conceived through in vitro fertilisation. Chloe tells her to name the baby before losing consciousness. Nicole names the baby girl Holly and later learns the child belongs to her and the late Daniel Jonas. This makes Maggie Horton the baby's paternal grandmother. Nicole was in a relationship with Deimos Kiriakis and then they were engaged and then she dumped him. In October 2018, it is revealed that Nicole has been living in Nashville Tennessee at Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey)'s old apartment with Holly. When Eric arrives to confess his love for her, she reveals she is married to Xander, who is blackmailing her with a recording that reveals her as Deimos' killer. When Nicole escapes Xander's hold, she travels to a warehouse to meet with Eric; there, she becomes trapped, and is revealed to have died following an explosion. When she suddenly reappears, she is revealed to be Kristen in a mask and wig, using Nicole's identity to try and seduce Brady into taking her back. She also tries to steal the DiMera family business from under her brother Stefan, which fails when Stefan blocks her from regaining ownership of Nicole's former company. Xander subsequently steals the mask after getting fed up with Kristen, who resorts to posing as her doppelg√§nger until she can get it back. Her plan ultimately backfired after she was exposed at John and Marlena's anniversary party. In September 2019, Nicole is discovered alive and living in Chicago. It is revealed that she willingly let Kristen steal her identity to protect Holly. Eric swears to bring them both back home now that Kristen's scheme has unraveled. On July 14, 2020, in a small intimate ceremony at the Brady Pub, Nicole Walker and Eric Brady finally exchange their vows and Nicole muses that it has taken 20 years to get here. The fly in the ointment is that although uninvited to the wedding, Sami's back.

Given that the population of the town was a little under 2,000, the disaster that befell the little fishing harbour must have been big news across the region, as the fire drew a crowd of 10,000 spectators. It was the local coastguard, Edwin George Lane, who on 16 November at about 10.45pm spotted flames coming from the roof of a shop. He raised the alarm and a large crowd gathered. Winds caused the inferno to be carried into Marine Street, and Harbour Street beyond, causing great damage where almost all the buildings were destroyed. It was not until 8AM the next morning that the flames were extinguished, although firemen stayed for several hours to put out the smouldering embers.

Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian Silver Cairn and numerous tumuli. In that same vicinity of the Laeca Burn watershed is the point d'appui of historic battles between invading Danes and indigenous Picts. Pitsligo was an area originally owned by the Lords Pitsligo, however after the Jacobite rising of 1745 these lands were forfeited because of the last Lord's support for the losing side. Part of the estate eventually passed to William Forbes of Monymusk who founded the village of New Pitsligo on the site of the existing hamlet of Cyaak. The boundaries of the original hamlet run roughly from the woods, where the small stream runs through the village, North towards the Fraserburgh end of the village. However now the village as a whole is referred under this name. Recreation Although it is one of the bigger villages within the area, recreational facilities are limited. There is the village hall, which can be rented out to use for clubs and holds the long-standing Visual Arts Exhibition. There is a football pitch, situated next to Low Street, which has changing rooms on site. Also below there is a second field, which in years past has been used as a playing field for youngsters and was provided with goals including nets. However these no longer exist. There is a third, small football pitch in one of the fields behind the school, which has recently been upgraded. There are no tennis facilities, despite these existing in the nearby villages of Strichen and Longside which have smaller populations. There is a local Freemason's Lodge which is situated in School Street. Established in 1872. Employment Historically, many people from the village were employed in quarrying for granite. Also, many people worked on the peat moss which lies in the area between the east of the village and Strichen. The village is also famous for New Pitsligo lace.

The park is adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center and Avenida Houston entertainment district. Discovery Green features a lake, bandstands and venues for public performances, two dog runs, a playground, and multiple recreational lawns.Discovery Green Park Features - Discovery Green Conservancy In the early 2000s, a public‚Äìprivate partnership between the City of Houston and a group of local philanthropic organizations, including the Kinder Foundation, was formed with the goal of constructing a new public green space in Downtown. This partnership financed the purchase of a series of surface parking lots on the east side of Downtown. Following the completion of land purchases in 2004, the Discovery Green Conservancy and the City jointly raised $125 million to construct the park. The design of the park, led by landscape architecture firm Hargreaves Associates, began in 2005. Discovery Green's public opening occurred on April 13, 2008; during the first two months of operation, an estimated 250,000 people visited the park. History The City of Houston acquired a portion of the land in front of the George R. Brown Convention Center in 2002. When the rest of the property went up for sale, a group of philanthropists led by Maconda Brown O‚ÄôConnor of the Brown Foundation, and Nancy G. Kinder of the Kinder Foundation approached then-Mayor Bill White with their idea of turning the space into an urban park. The Mayor agreed and became a strong advocate of a public-private partnership was developed for the $125 million project. Several other philanthropic foundations joined the effort, including the Wortham Foundation and the Houston Endowment, Inc. The City of Houston purchased the remainder of the land in 2004 and created the framework for the park‚Äôs construction and operations, including the role of the new organization, Discovery Green Conservancy, incorporated in 2004. When the Houston City Council approved the contracts to provide partial funding and support to the park, it also mandated that the ‚Äúpublic at large‚Äù be engaged in the design and development of the park. With the guidance of Project for Public Spaces, the Conservancy mounted the large public meetings and smaller focus groups to solicit public feedback. This feedback became the basis for the park‚Äôs programming. Hargreaves Associates, an internationally renowned landscape architecture firm based in San Francisco, oversaw the design effort. Page [formerly PageSoutherlandPage] designed the park's architecture and Larry Speck was their lead architect. Lauren Griffith Associates. provided landscape and horticultural design services. Artists Margo Sawyer and Doug Hollis were integral members of the design team and produced three works of art for the park. A large team of local and international engineers and specialists supported the core design team. Elmore Public Relations was contracted for marketing and public relations. Ever since the opening in 2008, the park has added upon. An estimate of $1 billion worth of buildings, offices, hotels, and housing projects were added to the park's surroundings. In 2009 the One Park Place opened. A high-end residential tower that houses 346 units. On 2011, the Hess Tower was built, a 29-story office building. On 2016, the Marriott Marquis convention hotel was built north of the park. A hotel that holds over 1,000 rooms.

The Kinder Foundation provided $10 million to help fund the $125 million project.  Design Process  Hargreaves Associates and their team of architects, engineers, and artists took thirteen months to design and finalize the park. Notable challenges would be the dense intersection and the intricate design of implementing the garage with the surface park. The park is placed in the center of two juxtaposing cross axes. The linear plaza is lined by a multitude Mexican Sycamore trees and uniquely designed pavement. Due to the straight nature of the path, it supports farmers markets, art fairs and parades.

Licensed to Owosso, Michigan, it serves Shiawassee County. While the station is a daytimer, licensed to operate during daylight hours only, its programming is heard around the clock on its FM translator W276CZ (103.1 MHz). On weekday mornings, it carries The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show, syndicated by Westwood One from KHKS-FM in Dallas. On weekday evenings, a two-hour sports radio show is heard. The rest of the schedule, WOAP plays adult hits, mostly rock and pop hits from the 1980s and 1990s. FM Translator WOAP operates a 250-watt FM translator which simulcasts WOAP, and broadcasts 24 hours a day to the immediate Owosso and Corunna areas. Although licensed to Saginaw, the translator's signal does not reach that city. History WOAP signed on the air on January 1, 1948.Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 176 It was founded as an AM/FM combo station by the local daily newspaper. The call letters stand for Owosso Argus- Press. The AM station was, and still is, a daytime-only station, while the FM station was intended to provide full-time service to the Owosso area. But at that time, there were few FM radios so WOAP-FM went silent by 1953. A decade later, there were enough FM radios in circulation to allow WOAP-FM to return to the air on December 2, 1965. Because the Argus-Press had a media monopoly in the Owosso area at that time with its daily newspaper and two radio stations, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced the Argus-Press to sell the radio stations in 1987. The FM station is known today as 103.9 WRSR. In the late 1990s, the Michigan Radio Group sold both stations. Connoisseur Communications then assumed ownership of both, turning WMZX into a more regional station serving the Flint area while still licensed to Owosso. WOAP adopted an adult standards music format in 1995 after WFDF 910 AM dropped the format in favor of talk. The weaker WOAP, with its daytime-only signal, was then sold the following year to Hartman Broadcasting, which continued to operate WOAP as a local service, still retaining the standards format and imaging it as Great American Classics. Less than two years later, Hartman Broadcasting sold WOAP to 1090 Investments, which immediately applied to the FCC for a construction permit to move the station's operations to Waverly, located in Lansing's suburbs. The move would have allowed WOAP to increase its daytime power to 50,000 watts and add nighttime power authorization at 4500 watts. Three years after the application was received, the FCC chose to dismiss the application, presumably under the likelihood that granting the station nighttime power would cause interference to WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut and KRLD in Dallas, the Class A clear channel stations on AM 1080. In January 2006, WOAP dropped its full service news/talk format and adopted Catholic Religious programming. Three months later, 1090 Investments requested a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to take the station dark, citing financial difficulties. The station remained off the air for almost a year. Four months after going dark, the station applied for reinstatement to move its facilities to Waverly and increase its daytime power, but withdrew its application for nighttime power. However, 1090 Investments pleaded for the FCC in its engineering presentation to be considered for nighttime power again, citing that denying Waverly local radio service in favor of a Connecticut station that had no local presence in Michigan would hurt its attempts to serve its community in an adequate fashion. In March 2007, WOAP was granted permission to move from Owosso to Waverly and increase its power with a six-tower directional antenna system to be built in Ingham County, about 20 miles south of Lansing. The station also returned to the air with a simulcast of the sports radio programming on sister station 1090 WCAR in Livonia, Michigan. Despite the good news, WOAP again applied for a silent STA, going dark again on July 20, 2007. WOAP applied for an extension to stay off the air on January 8, 2008, citing ongoing financial difficulties. The request was granted on February 25, 2008. The STA extension expired on July 21, 2008. The station returned to the air in mid-July 2008 simulcasting co-owned WCAR, but fell silent once again on August 18, 2008. On July 21, 2008 (the day that WOAP's STA extension was set to expire), local webcaster Mint City Radio launched WOAP Online, an internet-only radio station patterned after the old WOAP's full service format. WOAP Online was programmed as a local radio station, featured music from the 1970s-90s, agricultural features, local announcements and old-time radio shows. WOAP Online has also featured coverage of local events, such as the Clinton County 4-H Youth Fair and Saint Johns Mint Festival (including coverage of the annual Mint Festival Parade). In September 2008, the station again applied for permission to remain silent due to \\"ongoing financial problems.\\" As a matter of general FCC policy, financial causes are not sufficient reason to remain silent and still retain the license - the reason must be something \\"beyond the control\\" of the licensee.FCC In May 2009, 1090 Investments sold its radio stations, including WOAP, to Birach Broadcasting Corporation. At that point, Mint City Radio dropped the WOAP moniker for its webcasts effective June 1. When the new management entered the studios for the first time on July 18, they found that practically nothing worked and the roof leaked. They had to rebuild the station and had a deadline from the FCC of August 18 to get the station back on the air or lose the operating license. The station returned to the air branded as The Big 1080 on August 14, 2009, with an oldies format from its Owosso studio location. As the station returned to the air, the master control studio was being rebuilt and the neon WOAP sign, which had not worked for several years, was being repaired. WOAP announced on the air that Birach Broadcasting had ended its plans to move the station to the Lansing area. \\"The Big 1080\\" returned the traditional oldies format to a large chunk of mid-Michigan that had been without the format for some time, as the Lansing market no longer has an oldies station. WOAP was also the only station serving the Flint market with a 1950s-1970s nostalgia-based format, as WFNT, which had been airing Citadel Media's Timeless Favorites format, changed to a News/Talk format in February 2010. WOAP carried Spartan Nation Radio which covers Michigan State University athletics weeknights from 6 to 9. The station began 24-hour streaming audio on the World Wide Web in September 2010. Weekend programming included two syndicated programs, Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember and Dick Bartley's Classic Countdown. Also included in the weekend lineup was a Sunday morning church service and a local Polka program. Spanish language and music programming was later added to weekend afternoons. As of February 2012, WOAP began broadcasting in C-Quam AM Stereo. On April 10, 2012, Birach sold WOAP and WMJH AM 810 in Grand Rapids to Cano‚Äôs Broadcasting Company, pending FCC approval. Total combined sale for both stations was $1.1-million in the form of a promissory note. However, as of October 2015, no record had yet been filed with the FCC that the sale had been consummated, and the station's license was renewed to Birach on April 9, 2015. WOAP continued to carry Oldies with the evening sports talk show \\"Spartan Nation Radio\\" hosted by Hondo Carpenter. After three weeks of stunting with music of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, WOAP re-launched as \\"Super Hits 10-8-O\\" at the beginning of March 2013. The oldies format at that time evolved into more of a classic hits/oldies hybrid, with more 1980s music added into rotation. On July 1, 2013, the station changed to a Spanish language format full time. After this flip, much of the format and presentation was moved onto WMJH, effectively resulting in a format swap between the two stations. On February 2, 2015, the Spanish format was dropped and replaced with an adult hits format, this time an emphasis on 1980s and 1990s rock and pop music. On September 4, 2015, WOAP added an FM translator station, 'W276CZ. It simulcasts WOAP and operates 24 hours a day. The FM signal serves the immediate Owosso/Corunna area. On September 2, 2015, Birach Broadcasting again sold WOAP and sister station WMJH to Cano's Broadcasting, LLC. The sale, at a price of $1.1 million, was consummated on January 1, 2016.

Known locally as Sandtown, the community's name was derived from the trails of sand that dropped from wagons leaving town after filling up at the local sand and gravel quarry back in the days of horse-drawn wagons. It is located North of West Lafayette Street, West of North Fremont Avenue, South of West North Avenue, and East of North Monroe Street, covering an area of 72 square blocks, patrolled by the Baltimore Police Department's Western District. The community is 98.5% black. This neighborhood is one of West Baltimore's most blighted communities. History Sandtown is located in a historically black area of West Baltimore neighboring the once affluent Upton. In the second half of the 20th century, Sandtown experienced economic depression, housing abandonment, crime, civil uprisings and racial rioting. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s famous African American performers such as Billie Holiday and Diana Ross performed there and it was sometimes referred to as Baltimore's Harlem, by the time of the 2015 protests and rioting over the death of Freddie Gray, 3% of its population was incarcerated, a third of its housing abandoned, 20% of working age people were unemployed, and a third of residents were living in poverty. In 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed columnist William Galston drew lessons from the history of Port Clinton, Ohio to Baltimore and reported 52% unemployment among 16 to 64 year-olds in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, twice the unemployment rate of Baltimore as a whole.

Life The Rheinsberg Palace where Janitsch performed Janitsch was born in Schweidnitz, Silesia (today ≈öwidnica, Poland). His father was a local merchant and later a Royal Tobacco importer for Schweidnitz and Jauer (today Jawor). His mother was the daughter of a well respected surgeon. He received his first musical education at the Latin school of the Holy Trinity in his hometown. His special inclination towards music led him to undertake a brief period of study in Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw) with the court musicians who were under the employment of the Archbishop of Breslau. In 1729 his father sent him to Frankfurt an der Oder, where he studied law at the University of Frankfurt an der Oder until 1733. During this time he received his first commissions to write large scale musical works for festive occasions. In 1733 Janitsch moved to Berlin to for three years as secretary to the Prussian state and war minister Franz Wilhelm von Happe. In 1736, the then Crown Prince, Frederick offered him a position as a \\"Contraviolinist\\" in his ensemble in Ruppin and a year later, in Rheinsberg, where Janitsch's home was destroyed in the great fire in 1740. During his time in Rheinsberg, with the permission of the Crown Prince, he founded the circle \\"Freitagsakademien\\" (Friday academies), in which music was performed by professional and amateur musicians alike. From 1740, when Frederick ascended to the Prussian throne, Janitsch's position as Contraviolinist was transferred to the newly founded Berlin Court Orchestra, where he was awarded a salary of 350 thalers. The Friday academies continued in Berlin in his home in the form of weekly concerts open to the public. This musical association was the first in a long line of similar organisations which arose in Berlin after 1750. From 1743, Janitsch was required to compose and organise \\"Redutenmusik\\" for the annual court balls held at carnival time by Frederick. The music was performed by 24 oboists, specially selected from various regiments of the Prussian army. In 1749 Janitsch married Johanna Henriette Eymler, the adoptive daughter of the civil servant and mayor Albrecht Emil Nicolai. Janitsch died in Berlin in 1763, although the exact date of his death is unknown. Some years after Janitsch's death, the composer Johann Wilhelm Hertel remarked He was a good contapuntist and his Quartets are even now the best models of their kind. Janitsch's compositional style is typical of the galant and the empfindsamer Stil of the first half of the 18th century. Although several of Janitsch's works were already published by Breitkopf during his lifetime, most of his surviving output exists in manuscript form. The largest repository of Janitsch's surviving works is the archive of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which was thought to have been destroyed during World War II until it was rediscovered in the Kyiv Conservatory in 2000.Patricia Kennedy Grimsted. \\"Bach is Back in Berlin: The Return of the Sing-Akademie Archive from Ukraine in the Context of Displaced Cultural Treasures and Restitution Politics\\", Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2003 There are also many other manuscripts in libraries across Europe.

The City of Chicago purchased the building and it is now a Chicago Public Library. It originally had upper-floor apartments. It also housed the offices of the Douglass National Bank and the Overton Hygienic Company, during the 1930s. The Overton Hygienic Company was nationally known as a cosmetics firm. Overton Hygienic went out of business in the early 1980s. In the mid-1990s, the building was reused as a branch of the Chicago Public Library.

It is a daytime only station broadcasting on a frequency of 1350 kHz at a power output of 250 watts, non-directional. History =Beginnings= WGDN's construction permit was issued on November 28, 1973, to Gladwin Broadcasting Company, headed by George Benko, a resident of Croswell, in Michigan's Thumb Area. Benko today owns Sanilac Broadcasting, licensee of WMIC, WTGV, and WBGV. The station made its debut on December 7, 1974 as WJEB, broadcasting a country music format. The station did broadcast on its current frequency, but did so using a two-tower directional antenna system, allowing it to operate with an output power of 1,000 watts, but still daytime only. The station's studios, offices and transmitter facility were located at 3601 West Woods Road in Gladwin, and remain there today. On December 10, 1974, shortly after its initial sign-on, the FCC granted WGDN pre-sunrise authorization to operate at 350 watts two hours before local sunrise, allowing it to sign-on at 6am year-round, rather than local sunrise time. In 1977, Gladwin Broadcasting Company was granted a construction permit for an FM station. That station, WGMM, went on the air February 7, 1979 with an easy-listening format. =Sale to Apple Broadcasting= In December 1986, Gladwin Broadcasting Company agreed to sell WGDN and WGMM to Apple Broadcasting Company, for $75,000. The company was headed by Michael Baker, who also served as station general manager, sales manager, and chief engineer. Concurrent with the ownership change, approved the following March, was a call letter change for both stations to its current incarnation. The format offerings for both stations remained relatively unchanged. This changed in 1989, when the owner principals of Apple Broadcasting Company changed. Timothy Coston became company president, and Steve Coston assumed the position of general manager. The Costons are brothers. In 1991, both radio stations were programming an easy listening format, though still separate entities. In 1993, WGDN changed its format to adult contemporary, while WGDN-FM maintained its easy listening format. The latter also received an increase to its current power level that year. In 2001, WGDN adopted a religious format, which continues today. Concurrent with this format flip was WGDN-FM's move to country music, both formats continue today. In 2011, Timothy Coston sold his shares in Apple Broadcasting to Steve Coston and another shareholder, Ralph Haines III, giving his brother controlling interest in the station (51%).

It protected the Spanish settlement, called Santa Cruz de Nuca, the first colony in British Columbia. History It was first built by Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez in 1789 but dismantled in October of that year. It was then rebuilt and enlarged in 1790 then Nootka Sound was reoccupied by Francisco de Eliza. The fort was essentially an artillery land battery for the defence of the harbour and buildings. The Spanish settlement, called Santa Cruz de Nuca, was the first colony in British Columbia. The fort lay near the home of Maquinna, chief of the Mowachaht group, who are now in the joint Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nations band government with the Muchalaht at Gold River nearby on Vancouver Island. On May 15, 1789 Mart√≠nez chose the location of his fortification at the entrance of Friendly Cove on Hog Island. Work progressed so that on May 26 they were able to place their artillery followed by the construction of barracks and a powder storeroom. On June 24, 1789 a salvo was fired from the new fort and the Spanish ships in what Mart√≠nez considered an official act of possession of Nootka Harbour. On July 4, the American vessels and their captains Gray and Kendrick (who had arrived in the harbour 7 months earlier than Mart√≠nez) fired salvos and fireworks in recognition of their recent independence from Britain accompanied by a further salvo from the Spanish fort. On July 29, 1789 new orders arrived from Viceroy Flores directing Mart√≠nez to abandon the station and return to San Blas. The artillery from the fort was loaded back aboard the Princesa and he left Friendly Cove on October 30, 1789. The fort was dismantled, but anticipating a reoccupation, Mart√≠nez buried crates of bricks and lime. The fort was rebuilt one year later, in 1790, by Pedro de Alberni, a senior captain of the Spanish Army, who served the Spanish Crown in the First Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia along with 80 other men. They sailed to Nootka with the Francisco de Eliza expedition. After arriving at Nootka, Eliza established three lines of defence: the 300-ton frigate Concepci√≥n, the soldiers under Alberni on land and on the frigate, and the rebuilding of the battery on San Miguel Island. The construction of the battery was difficult. It was built on top of a rocky islandtall but small. Embrasures had to be built to support the guns. It then took four days to emplace eight large cannons. Later, six smaller cannons were also emplaced. The battery did not have enough space for the remaining eight large cannon Eliza had brought, so they were stored ashore.At the Far Reaches of Empire, pp. 144, 150-151 The Spanish soldiers left the fort in 1792. In 1795 it was finally abandoned under the terms of the third Nootka Convention. Before being occupied by Spain the site had been the Mowachaht summer village of Yuquot. It was reoccupied by the Mowachaht under Chief Maquinna. Remnants of the Spanish post, including its kitchen garden, were still visible when John R.

The station broadcasts from a transmitter southeast of I-675 Exit 6 (Tittabawassee Road) in Carrollton Township in Saginaw County. History =Beginnings at 102.5= Established by James Gerity, a professional violinist who acquired WNEM-TV in 1961, WGER began broadcasting later that year at 102.5 MHz under the WNEM-FM calls and featured a Beautiful Music format for the first couple decades of its existence.The Saginaw News: \\"Memories of Saginaw's 'Beautiful Music' spark WGER 102.5 FM Historical Society\\", March 6, 2011. The call letters were changed to WGER after Gerity sold the TV station in 1969. WGER's beautiful music format, programmed by TM Programming, achieved high ratings in adult demographics in both the Tri- Cities and Flint markets thanks to its 86,000-watt signal licensed to Bay City. At one point, in 1971, Arbitron research showed that WGER was the second highest-rated radio station in the nation.Copy of letter at Facebook: WGER FM 102.5 Historical Society, December 1, 2011. During this time, Gerity owned several other stations across Michigan, including WABJ and WQTE in Adrian and WPON in Pontiac. =Sale and Move to 106.3= James Gerity died in 1973. In 1986, Gerity's estate sold WGER to the owner of CHR-formatted WIOG, licensed to Saginaw at 106.3 which was sold to F-B Communications, a company headed by Jack Fitzgerald, who also served as what would become the new WGER 106.3's general manager. In the mid-1980s, the local radio scene was undergoing some major changes, with the Saginaw radio market being enlarged to include Bay and Midland Counties as well as Saginaw County and becoming the Saginaw-Bay City- Midland radio market and with Pinconning-based WFXZ \\"Foxy 101\\" entering the CHR fray as a direct competitor to WIOG. As a result, WGER and WIOG swapped frequencies that summer, with WGER moving its easy listening format to 106.3. WGER evolved from easy listening to mainstream AC on 106.3 and eventually took the name \\"Soft Rock 106.3\\" by the late 1980s before adopting the moniker \\"Magic 106.3\\". In April 1996, WGER was sold to Fritz Broadcasting, which owned WSGW and WIOG, for $4.2 million. The format remained the same. By 2005, WGER had evolved from mainstream AC to its current Hot AC sound, although it would be several months before the station stopped reporting to Radio & Records/Mediabase 24/7's Adult Contemporary airplay panel and switched to the Hot AC panel. The station added songs like \\"Fergalicious\\" by Fergie and \\"Girl Next Door\\" by Saving Jane that did not fit the AC format and introduced a \\"Totally 80's Weekend\\" while continuing to feature the Soft AC sounds of Delilah at night. That same year, Magic 106.3 got an AC competitor when MacDonald Broadcasting changed its adult standards WSAM-AM and oldies WSAG-FM to a Soft AC simulcast called \\"The Bay,\\" a gold-based Soft AC simulcast meant to fill the void left when WGER migrated to Hot AC. In the summer of 2007, Delilah moved to \\"The Bay,\\" and WGER became the new home of the John Tesh radio show in the Tri-Cities market. Increased competition from WSAM/WSAG and top-rated oldies/classic hits station WHNN (which had added more '80s music to its playlist), as well as listener perception that the sound of the station was inconsistent, had led to a decline in WGER's ratings over the past several years. The Fall 2007 Arbitron ratings book showed WGER in tenth place 12+ with a 3.3 share; however, by Spring 2008, the station had sunk to a 2.2 share 12+, falling behind Gladwin-based rimshot country station WGDN-FM. WGER was the first station in the Tri-Cities market to play continuous Christmas music for the holiday season. In 2006, however, the station announced that it would not change to all-Christmas that year because of research that showed its listeners didn't want it, which left the door open for 96.1 WHNN to change to Christmas music, with which it was very successful. In 2007, both WGER and WHNN went all-Christmas shortly after Halloween. WGER rebranded from \\"Magic 106.3\\" to \\"Mix 106.3\\" in February 2009. In the years since, the station has evolved its format from Hot AC to Adult CHR, with all 1980s music dropped from rotation, many 1990s songs eliminated as well, and a strong current/recurrent orientation, along with a small amount of hip-hop music added in.

He fled Nazi Germany in 1939, and went on to become a brewer, executive, and consultant in the American brewing industry. He received numerous awards during his career, which spanned both the large national brewery and the microbrew segments of the industry. Karl Strauss Brewing Company, which he helped found in 1989, continues to bear his name. Early life He was born October 5, 1912, on the second floor of the administration building of the Feldschl√∂sschen Br√§u, a brewery in Minden, Germany, of which his father was president. The second born of two boys and a girl to Albrecht and Mathilde Strauss, he attended the Oberrealschule in Minden where he received his Abitur. During his young life he assisted his father as a brewer and intern while living in the family quarters at the brewery. At age 19, he went to the Technical University of Munich at Weihenstephan, where he received a degree in the science and practice of malting and brewing. In addition, he received Master Brewer certification, allowing him to teach apprentice brewers. With his diploma in hand, he began working at breweries including the Falkenkreuz Brauerei Lippert in Detmold, Westphalia; the Bauer Brauerei in L√ºbeck, Holstein; and the Altst√§dter Malzfabrik in Altstadt, Thuringia. With the rise of the Nazis, Germany was not a safe place for the Jewish Strauss family, and work became scarce. \\"I graduated from college while Hitler was in power and as a Jew could not find employment in the brewing industry,\\" he wrote in 1943. Thanks to family living in the United States, he was able to secure sponsorship to emigrate. But other members of his family were not so lucky. The last time he saw his mother was the night he left Germany. She later was killed in a concentration camp. His brother was killed in a Nazi raid on the Polish underground. Career in America In 1939, Strauss left Germany for the United States, followed soon by his first wife, Irene Vollweiler. He had planned to join family members in San Francisco, California, but stopped in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the urging of an uncle to visit family friends. While there he applied for a job with the Pabst Brewing Company, which he intended to be temporary. \\"I arrived in Milwaukee on St. Patrick's Day, 1939,\\" he later recalled. \\"I started to work at Pabst on May 11, 1939, and I worked for Pabst for 44 years.\\" He began his work at Pabst feeding bottles to the bottle soaker. However, \\"once Pabst realized that it had a Bavarian brew master in its employ, Strauss quickly advanced.\\" Within a few months he was promoted to foreman of filtration. He continued to quickly move up the corporate ladder, becoming an assistant superintendent and later malt house superintendent. In 1942, he was transferred to Pabst's brewery in Peoria, Illinois, as the plant production manager. Within a few years he was made head maltster in Milwaukee and was assistant superintendent of the malt house and brewhouse. In 1948, he was promoted to superintendent of Pabst's newly purchased plant in Los Angeles, and remained there until 1956. He was named technical director of Pabst in 1958, and promoted to vice-president of production in 1960. He helped Pabst reformulate its beer, as well as create a new Pabst Blue Ribbon. He continued as vice-president until retiring from Pabst in 1983. His first wife died in 1978. He married his second wife, Marjean Schaefer, in 1980. Post-retirement In the 1980s, Strauss began a new career as a brewery consultant, providing services for both large breweries and microbreweries throughout the world. He had clients in Europe, Asia, and North America, including Molson, Tsingtao, The Boston Beer Company, and Goose Island Beer Company. He helped design more than 50 brewpubs and microbreweries. In 1987, a cousin, Chris Cramer, and Cramer's college roommate, Matt Rattner, asked Strauss to help them develop a brewpub in San Diego, California. Strauss not only designed the brewery and trained the brewers; he also formulated the original beer recipes and lent his name to the endeavor. Opening on February 2, 1989, Karl Strauss Brewing Company became the first new brewery in San Diego in more than fifty years and is credited with having launched the craft brewing industry in San Diego. Strauss served as the brewmaster and corporate image of Karl Strauss Brewing Company. As corporate spokesman he made radio commercials in his thick German accent, always concluding \\"...or my name isn't Karrrrl Strrrrrauss!\\"; on the technical side he was heavily involved in the design of the company's new properties and brewing of new beers. He remained actively involved with the company until his death in Milwaukee on December 21, 2006, at the age of 94. He is buried at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in Los Angeles. Strauss co-authored a book, The Practical Brewer, published by the Master Brewers Association of the Americas. Legacy Strauss was president of the Master Brewers Association of the Americas from 1961‚Äì63. He is the only person to receive all three of the highest awards given by the association: the Award of Merit (1981), given to an individual or individuals who made an outstanding contribution to the brewing industry; the Award of Honor (1992), given to a member who has rendered outstanding service to the association; and the Distinguished Life Service Award (2003), which recognizes MBAA members who have given exceptional service to the association. Karl was a founder and director of the Museum of Beer and Brewing in Milwaukee. The museum now presents an annual Karl Strauss Award to individuals for lifetime contributions to the industry. In 2006, Karl Strauss Brewing Company set up the Karl Strauss Brewers Education Fund with the Jewish Community Foundation of San Diego. The fund provides financial educational support to aspiring southern California brewers pursuing a career in the field of brewing.

It was formed in 1974 as the National Federation of Self Employed (NFSE). The current name for the organisation was adopted in 1991. It is registered with Companies House as The National Federation of Self Employed & Small Businesses Limited (company number 1263540). FSB is a member-led, not-for-profit and non-party political organisation. FSB is a lobbying organisation representing small firms and the self-employed to UK, national, local and devolved government. FSB offers its members a range of benefits, such as a 24-hour legal advice line and free business banking. In January 2018, FSB's Board of Directors altered the organisation's volunteer structure by switching from elected Branches & Regions to an unelected, ad-hoc approach to local lobbying & representation. This necessitated changes to FSB's National Council which now comprises 12 appointed representatives, selected from the 9 English regions and the 3 devolved countries. In 2017 FSB had 184 branches around the UK and these were grouped into 33 regions. Each branch and region has its own committee. In addition, there is a national committee which includes representatives from each regional committee.  National campaigns  FSB runs a number of national campaigns on behalf of its members, to highlight the needs of Small Businesses and the Self Employed. Most recently FSB ran a ‚ÄòWellbeing‚Äô campaign to support the health of small business owners and their staff. The campaign was backed by MIND, Public Health England, UK Active, and Seb Coe. Historically, previous campaigns have included: * Keep Trade Local: FSB Launched the Keep Trade Local campaign in August 2008 *Real Life Entrepreneurs: FSB launched Real Life Entrepreneurs in October 2011 * #ibacksmallbusiness: FSB launched #ibacksmallbusiness campaign in July 2014 The #ibacksmallbusiness campaign has been a success and is still an active hashtag. FSB also supports a number of other national campaigns on behalf of its members, to highlight the needs of Small Businesses and the Self Employed.  Lobbying  FSB's past political lobbying activities have led in its own opinion to a number of benefits for small businesses, such as: * Repeatedly overcoming attempts to impose unreasonable National Insurance Contributions * The introduction of enhanced capital allowances and flexible working hours * The reduction or removal of Corporation Tax for small limited companies * VAT reform in the form of a flat rate scheme for small businesses * An end to automatic fines for incorrect filing of VAT returns  Events  FSB organises events aimed at supporting FSB, its members and the small business community around the United Kingdom. National events are arranged by FSB's Events Team based in the Blackpool office, with the assistance of a nationwide network of staff and volunteers. The FSB National Conference attracts more than 1,100 attendees from all over the United Kingdom. Speakers have included Prime Ministers, Leader of the Opposition, Chancellor of the Exchequer and many more. The FSB National Conference was replaced with a Business Show in 2017. FSB is running a series of regional Awards to celebrate small businesses. These are open for nomination now, with 12 categories in each. The awards will take place in Spring 2018, building up to a national final in May 2018 as part of FSB‚Äôs Chairman‚Äôs Dinner. FSB is represented at local events like Nottinghamshire County Fair, Lincoln Show, Love Business East Midlands, and others. FSB's Regions and Branches host regular meetings around the country. Generally Branch meetings are open to all members. FSB also runs business networking events around the UK.  Membership  FSB is a member-led federation. Membership criteria are as follows: * Self-Employed or the owner, partner, or director of a business (or businesses) Based in the United Kingdom * Fewer than 250 employees. * Agree to the Members' Code of Conduct * Not barred from membership The membership was 185,000 in 2006 and >160,000 in 2016.

Early life and education Born on September 23, 1923, in Isale Eko, Lagos, Fafunwa had his secondary education at the CMS Grammar School, Lagos between 1937 and 1943. He obtained a B.Sc (Magna Cum Laude) in Social Science and English from Bethune Cookman College (now Bethune-Cookman University, Florida, United States in 1950 and had his M.A (Cum Laude) in Administration and Higher Education in 1955.

Daily Champion, January 24, 2007 He became a Professor of Education in 1966 and held the position of Dean, Faculty and Head, Department of Education at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN. Due to his brilliance and hard work, he rose to the position of Acting Vice Chancellor at both UNN and University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). He was also Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council, University of Calabar. He was at several times, President, Association of Teachers Education in Africa, Director, International Council on Education for Teaching, Washington D C. He retired from active teaching service in 1978 to start the first tutorial college in Nigeria in 1982 and was Minister of Education between 1990 and 1992. While at Nsukka, in collaboration with his colleagues at the education department, the department drafted a proposal to admit grade II teachers into a new two year degree program at the Faculty of Education. The proposal was subsequently adopted and in a few years led to the emergence of the Nigerian Certificate of Education\\"Thoughts On Babs Fafunwa,\\" 2 and further broadened the acceptance of Colleges of Education in the university system; today a lot of the colleges are affiliated with universities. He also continued an innovative tradition, already in existence at Nsukka, when he began to implement a curriculum for granting a bachelor's degree in education, the first faculty in the country to do so. A process which will further expand the career potential of many teachers.\\"Thoughts On Babs Fafunwa,\\" (2) In 1977, a long time proposal of his to incorporate native languages into pedagogy was finally accepted. Today, most Nigerians learn at least one Nigerian language. Fafunwa and a few other African educationists, had argued that embracing whole heartedly without evaluation foreign systems of education and epistemology, can create the potential for epistemological dis-orientation.

Main characters =Austin Powers= * Portrayed by: Mike Myers. Retrieved 12 September 2011. * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: James Bond and Jason King Austin Powers is a British secret agent, an \\"international man of mystery.\\" He works as a fashion photographer by day and a British Intelligence agent by night, and always becomes extremely excited when an attractive woman is working with him or is simply nearby. He is the main protagonist of the series. In all three films, Austin learns of a new plot by Dr. Evil and intervenes to prevent it. His quests to prevent Dr. Evil from carrying out his schemes often involve his meeting various types of people, getting into fights, and getting caught up in wacky situations. He has a new young and sexy female ally in every film (not counting Marie Kensington). =Dr. Evil= * Portrayed by: Mike Myers * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Julius No and Franz Oberhauser (novels)/Ernst Stavro Blofeld/Alec Trevelyan Douglas Powers, better known as Dr. Evil, is the incredibly bumbling, as well as extremely dimwitted evil genius and nemesis of Austin Powers, and the main antagonist of the series. He is the leader of an evil organization, Virtucon, with many henchmen as his allies. He concocts ridiculous schemes in every film, with Austin attempting to stop him from his doings. However, he never wins, often because his plans are always ridiculously overcomplicated; he is far too stupid to realize how much easier they can be. Other times, it is because something happens that interferes. He resembles Alec Trevalyan/Agent 006 in some ways, as Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were raised as brothers (before the car explosion), much like James Bond and Alec Trevelyan, who were raised at the same orphanage before being recruited by MI6. Also, Dr. Evil and Austin Powers attended the same spy academy together. Interestingly, the Daniel Craig James Bond films would later reinterpret the character of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (the chief inspiration for Dr. Evil) as a long-lost foster brother figure to Bond, somewhat (likely unintentionally) echoing the Austin Powers/Dr. Evil relationship. Dr. Evil's schemes often include his attempts to take over the world. They sometimes involve threatening to destroy or hurt something in exchange for money; one notable example is when he presented his giant laser to the president of the United States and said he would destroy Washington D.C. and possibly other major cities unless he was paid one hundred billion dollars. Aside from his schemes, Dr. Evil and his son Scott talk to each other, but he is a completely awful father, and Scott is often shown to be far more intelligent than his father. He was originally born Douglas Powers, son of Nigel Powers and twin brother to Austin Powers. He has a son with Frau Farbissina named Scott Evil, who is also the grandson of Nigel Powers and the nephew of Austin Powers. Austin's allies =Basil Exposition= * Portrayed by: Michael York * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: M Basil Exposition works for British Intelligence as Austin's controller. A happy-go-lucky man, he is very fond of Austin, saying he is \\"irresistible to women, deadly to his enemies and a legend in his own time.\\"Austin Powers bio at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 12 September 2011. He and Austin both went to the British Intelligence Academy together at the same time, presumably how they met. Basil often provides Austin with gadgets to help him complete his missions, and he is often seen wearing a carnation, even during his and Austin's time at the academy. Basil is a parody of the M character in the James Bond franchise. Moreover, since, in storytelling, \\"exposition\\" is the revealing of background information required to understand the current action, Basil's surname is a joke on his principal function in the films: to provide Austin and the audience with the necessary exposition. =Vanessa Kensington= * Portrayed by: Elizabeth Hurley * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Miss Moneypenny's younger assistant Penelope Smallbone in Octopussy, Teresa \\"Tracy\\" Draco-Bond Vanessa Kensington is Austin's partner in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, and the daughter of Austin's original partner, Marie. A beautiful, determined, intelligent young woman, Austin is heavily attracted to her, and often goes to great lengths to try to get her to sleep with him. She is disgusted by his attempts for much of the film, and continuously resists his temptations, but later grows more attracted to him. At the end of the film, she and Austin marry, and are last seen while on their honeymoon (see Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery). In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, she is revealed to be (or to have been replaced by) a Fembot, which Basil claims the ministry knew ahead of time, when she tries to kill Austin while they are in their honeymoon suite. =Felicity Shagwell= * Portrayed by: Heather Graham * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Tiffany Case Felicity Shagwell is a CIA agent who is partnered with Austin Powers when it is discovered that Vanessa is a Fembot and to help Austin get his mojo back. Like Vanessa, she is very beautiful physically, which Austin simply cannot resist being attracted to. However, she is much more attracted to him than Vanessa initially was, and they fall in love with one another. (See Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me). Felicity is notable for having slept with Fat Bastard in the line of duty to place a tracking device on him, which at first Austin is unhappy with. However, he eventually forgives her, and they work together to defeat Dr. Evil. She was originally intended to appear in the third film, in a scene that explained what happened to her character, but the scene was cut from the final release. =Foxxy Cleopatra= * Portrayed by: Beyonc√© KnowlesAustin Powers in Goldmember cast listing at the Internet Movie Database. Retrieved 12 September 2011. * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Rosie Carver Foxxy Cleopatra is Austin's groovy musician sidekick and former lover in Austin Powers in Goldmember. She is from the 1970s, dressing in clothing fashionable at the time and sporting a very large afro. She uses the word \\"sugar\\" often, pronouncing it as \\"sugah\\" (e.g. \\"You under arrest, sugah!\\"). She and Austin are reunited after eight years when Austin travels back to the 1970s, and they work together to stop Dr. Evil and Goldmember (see Austin Powers in Goldmember). Her character is inspired by \\"blaxploitation\\"-style characters played by Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson. =Mrs. Kensington= * Portrayed by: Mimi Rogers * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery * Based on: Emma Peel of The Avengers, Agent 99 of Get Smart Mrs. Marie Kensington is Austin's original sidekick back in the 1960s, and Vanessa's mother. She had originally tried to help Austin defeat Dr. Evil until he escaped, but the duo unfortunately failed. Having retired years after, her daughter works alongside Austin after he is unfrozen many years later, and she makes a brief appearance while on the phone with her daughter. Like Miss Moneypenny, she vaguely admits to having an attraction to Austin despite being married, but never follows through with it. She does not appear again in the series. =Number 3= * Portrayed by: Fred Savage * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember Number 3 is a very young agent and mole who works undercover for British Intelligence. He is assigned by his employers to become the assistant of Number 2, Dr. Evil's right-hand man. He manages to successfully get Mini-Me to change sides when Scott Evil takes his place next to Dr. Evil. (See Austin Powers in Goldmember) Despite his talents at his job, he has an enormous black mole on his face that neither Austin nor Dr. Evil can resist pointing out whenever they see him, making him a source of comedy in the film. Coincidentally, he works as a mole and has a mole on his face, of which he is painfully aware. =Nigel Powers= * Portrayed by: Michael Caine, Scott Aukerman (Young) * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Roger Moore as James Bond Nigel Powers is a Master Spy and Austin and Dr. Evil's father. When he took his family on a vacation and stopped to find a restroom, their car exploded, and Nigel returns to see that his wife is dead and that Austin survived, but is very frightened. He assumes \\"Dougie (Dr. Evil's actual first name is Douglas)\\" is dead (though he's actually living inside his mother's carcass), and continues to raise Austin. He and his son are very much alike ‚Äì they both enjoy a jetsetting, playboy lifestyle, and both are incomparable ladies' men. Their relationship is nevertheless strained, as Nigel was absent for much of Austin's childhood, and seems uninterested in having anything more than a casual friendship with his son. During Austin's knighthood, Nigel did not show up to be there for him, and Austin is later seen singing \\"Daddy Wasn't There\\" with his band, Ming Tea. He later reveals that he feels neglected by Nigel, who often gives him minimal respect. However, they manage to make up by the end of the film (see Austin Powers in Goldmember). Nigel is also extremely prejudiced against Dutch people, but hypocritically claims that he doesn't tolerate anyone who cannot stand the cultures of other people. =Commander Gilmour= * Portrayed by: Charles Napier * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Commander Gilmour is a commander who works for U.S. Strategic Command He is the one who is first notified of Dr. Evil's ship that \\"appears to be in the shape of a Big Boy\\" by Johnson Ritter, and makes sure to tell him to forget about what he saw. He travels to London, where he meets Austin after his unfreezing, and makes sure someone calls the president about what was seen. There, he briefs Austin on his mission. He also appears at the side of the president in the second film, and prevents the president from pressing the doomsday button in an attempt to destroy the moon. =General Borschevsky= * Portrayed by: Elya Baskin * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery * Based on: General Anatol Gogol General Nicolai Borschevsky is a Russian Intelligence officer. He is alongside Commander Gilmour when Austin is first briefed about his mission. Austin at first thinks he is mad for working with Russian intelligence, not knowing the Cold War had ended. Borschevsky only has one line in the film, and does not immediately know who Austin Powers is; he wonders if Powers worked for British Intelligence. Basil replied that he worked freelance. He does not appear again in the film. Dr. Evil's allies =Frau Farbissina= * Portrayed by: Mindy Sterling * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Rosa Klebb (Spectre #3) Frau Farbissina is Dr. Evil's attack and defense specialist and Scott's mother. She has a heavy German accent; in a running gag throughout the films, her shouting ‚Äì with the emphasis usually put on the last syllable ‚Äì causes everyone to flinch. Farbissina and Dr. Evil were lovers at one point in time, but now she identifies herself as a lesbian. She introduces her former lover to Scott when he returns. However, she actually cares about Scott and wants him to be happy, unlike his father. The character is a parody of Rosa Klebb from From Russia With Love and Irma Bunt from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. =Mini-Me= * Portrayed by: Verne Troyer. Retrieved 12 September 2011. * Appearances: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Nick Nack Mini-Me is a miniature clone that was made of Dr. Evil before he was sent back in time. He is completely identical to Dr. Evil except he is \\"one-eighth in size.\\" Mini-Me cannot talk, and often expresses himself with writing. However, he is never afraid to use his middle finger as an insult whenever necessary (See Mini-Me). Dr. Evil babies Mini-Me, treating him both like a child and a pet. He carries him in a baby carrier strapped to his body at one point, and even has him on a leash later. Mini-Me also enjoys making Scott Evil's life miserable, which makes Dr. Evil have to restrain him. Although he is incredibly small, he is a very strong fighter. Over time, Dr. Evil begins to neglect him as Scott becomes increasingly evil, and Number 3 eventually manages to successfully convince him to defect to Austin's side (see Austin Powers in Goldmember). =Number 2= * Portrayed by: Robert Wagner (The younger version of Number 2 is played by Rob Lowe.) * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Emilio Largo (Spectre #2) Number 2 is Dr. Evil's second in command who wears an eyepatch. He and Dr. Evil have known each other for many years, having attended school together. He, however, never liked his boss, constantly being \\"second best\\" behind him, and is actually a much better leader than he, always trying to stick to business. Dr. Evil, however, is far too stupid to realize this. =Scott Evil= * Portrayed by: Seth Green * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember Scott Evil is Frau and Dr. Evil's grungy teenage son. Perturbed by the fact that his father was absent for so long, and suddenly decided to show up, Scott constantly refuses Dr. Evil's pleas to bond with him. He is also shown to be far more intelligent than his father, and is almost always able to find an easier way to carry out his father's plans, which often prompts Dr. Evil to argue with him. Scott becomes increasingly evil (even losing his hair in the process) in the third film, and eventually replaces Mini-Me. Mini-Me eventually feels rejected by Dr. Evil and defects to Austin's side. At the end of Goldmember, Scott (now completely bald) swears revenge on Austin and his father, and has taken over his father's criminal empire (see Austin Powers in Goldmember). Scott is also Nigel Powers' grandson and Austin Powers' nephew biologically. Since Mini-Me is a clone of Dr. Evil, that would also make him Scott's father or uncle. =Fat Bastard= * Portrayed by: Mike Myers. Retrieved 12 September 2011. * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember Fat Bastard is a Scottish henchman working for Dr. Evil. He is incredibly foul-mouthed and morbidly obese, weighing \\"a metric ton\\"; however, he thinks of himself as \\"dead sexy\\" ‚Äì which he is heard calling himself ‚Äì and believes that women find him irresistible. In the second movie, he infiltrates the British Intelligence as a Scottish piper and steals Austin's mojo, which is later taken back by his enemies. Later, Felicity Shagwell reluctantly sleeps with him in the line of duty to place a tracking device on him. (See Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me). In the third movie, he is shown to have left Dr. Evil's employment, and has become a professional sumo wrestler in Japan. However, he is still doing strange jobs for Dr. Evil. At the end of the film, he is shown to have lost a lot of weight as a result of a Subway diet, but has a very large amount of excess skin (he even goes so far as to mention his neck looking \\"like a vagina.\\") =Goldmember= * Portrayed by: Mike Myers * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Auric Goldfinger/James Bond impersonating a Dutch man in Diamonds Are Forever Johann van der Smut, a.k.a. \\"Goldmember\\" is the main antagonist of Austin Powers in Goldmember. He is a rather peculiar and repulsive Dutch man, who wears a completely golden outfit and is the owner of a roller disco club. He teams up with Dr. Evil to kill Austin Powers and to take over the world, but is defeated and arrested by Foxxy Cleopatra. Having lost his genitals in an unfortunate smelting accident, he replaces them with a golden key that activates the \\"Preparation H\\" tractor beam. His other peculiarity disgusts both Dr. Evil and Austin alike; he has a habit of peeling off his own skin and then immediately eating it (much to the disgust of everyone else), hence small portions of his skin are seen missing from his body. =Alotta Fagina= * Portrayed by: Fabiana Udenio * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery * Based on: Pussy Galore (in name) Fiona Volpe (in character) Alotta Fagina is Number 2's girlfriend and secretary. Her name is a parody of Pussy Galore, while her characterization, being Number 2's henchman, is based on Fiona Volpe. Number 2 first introduces Austin to her while they are in the casino, and Austin, as with almost every other female character he encounters, is attracted to her. Later, while Austin and Alotta were in her jacuzzi she successfully manages to seduce and have sex with him, in order to figure out his true identity (Austin introduced himself as \\"Richie Cunningham\\" during the blackjack game). She is seen in Dr. Evil's lair, where she threatens to kill Vanessa Kensington, but is instead judo chopped by her. It remains unknown whether or not Alotta survived the self- destruction of the lair. In cable rebroadcasts, her name is sometimes censored to \\"Alotta Cleavaga\\". =Mustafa= * Portrayed by: Will Ferrell * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Man in a Cairo casino that Bond punches in the face in Diamonds Are Forever Mustafa is one of Dr. Evil's henchmen; he is an Arab who wears a red fez. His life is spared by Dr. Evil at the start of the first film, but a second mistake also puts his life on the line. While he feels pain like everyone else, he is near-impossible to kill. In the first film, he made a mistake during the unfreezing process and caused Mr. Bigglesworth to lose all of his hair, thereby angering Dr. Evil and prompting his attempt to burn Mustafa alive. However, the flames do not take his life, so Dr. Evil commands his guards to shoot him; Mustafa survives the first shot, but the second one seems to kill him since there's silence afterwards. In the second movie, Austin and Felicity try to interrogate him in 1969 (when he was alive) ‚Äì aided by the fact that he cannot stand being asked the same question three times in a row ‚Äì but Mini-Me shoots him in the neck with a blow dart, sending him over the edge of a cliff. A post-credits scene reveals he has survived this, but his legs are broken. =Mr. Bigglesworth= * Portrayed by: A Persian cat, later a Sphynx * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (miniature version) Austin Powers in Goldmember (flashbacks) Mr. Bigglesworth is Dr. Evil's pet Persian cat, whom Evil ensures is happy at all times. Mustafa, one of Dr. Evil's henchmen, made a mistake during the unfreezing process, which caused Mr. Bigglesworth to lose all of his hair; he is bald for the rest of the film. Mini-Me has a tiny version of him called \\"Mini Mr. Bigglesworth\\" in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The cat also appears as a kitten in flashbacks in the third film. =Paddy O'Brien= * Portrayed by: Paul Dillon * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Donald \\"Red\\" Grant/Necros Paddy O'Brien is an Irish henchman and assassin hired by Dr. Evil to kill Austin Powers. After he kills a victim, he leaves a charm from his charm bracelet behind with the body, and calls these pieces his \\"lucky charms\\", which he claims Scotland Yard is after. Both Dr. Evil and Frau laugh at this, with the latter explaining how the term is a reference to the famous brand of cereal. He is present during one of the most famous scenes of the first Austin Powers movie. When Austin is sitting on a toilet in a stall at the casino restroom, he appears out of a vent above Austin and sneakily tries to strangle him with his charm bracelet. Austin traps him in-between his legs and asks him, \\"Do you work for Number 2?\\" (\\"Who does Number 2 work for?\\" in later pressings of the film) The man in the adjacent stall (who thinks Austin is having trouble defecating), says, \\"You show that turd who's boss!\\" O'Brien is killed in the situation, having been drowned in the toilet, and his charms are later seen on the restroom floor. =Random Task= * Portrayed by: Joe Son * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery * Based on: Odd Job Random Task is a Korean assassin. A direct parody of Oddjob from the James Bond film Goldfinger, he throws a shoe instead of a hat. When his shoe- throwing gimmick fails (he uses it to break off the head on a statue in Dr. Evil's lair, but not on a real person), he tries to strangle Austin, but instead Vanessa knocks him out. =Robin Swallows= * Portrayed by: Gia Carides * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Fiona Volpe Robin Swallows (n√©e Spitz) is an employee of Dr. Evil, who encounters Austin in his apartment in 1969 with a bunch of other girls. First, she tries to flirt with Austin as a beautiful girl, Felicity arrives and tells Austin that Robin works for Dr. Evil but Austin doesn't believe her. Austin only starts to believe Felicity when Robin winks at the ceiling and when Austin also looks, he sees a man holding a knife and realizes Felicity is right, Austin then uses Robin to block the knife from him. After her death, Dr. Evil reveals she is an assassin. However, like Mustafa, she is shown to be incredibly difficult to kill; she is stabbed in the back, shot with an MP40, blasted with a bazooka, and falls out a window and over the edge of a building landing on her face, all of which fail to kill her. =Ivana Humpalot= * Portrayed by: Kristen Johnston * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me * Based on: Anya Amasova, Xenia Onatopp, and other female Soviet agents Ivana Humpalot is a stereotypical Russian woman who is participating in the photo shoot Austin is taking pictures at in the beginning of the second film. She wears a white fur Russian hat and coat and underneath a black nearly see through bodysuit. After the shoot, she and Austin play an erotic game of chess. She was actually sent by Dr. Evil to kill Austin, but fails to do so when she falls for him and claims he is too sexy and ends up having sex with him, although it does not last long as Austin loses his mojo while they do before she can reach orgasm. =Jurgen, Generalisimo, Don Luigi, and Rita= * Portrayed by: Ben Scott (Jurgen), John-Clay Scott (Don Luigi), and Hannah Kozak (Rita) (Generalisimo's actor is uncredited as he is not included in the IMDB) * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery Jurgen, Generalisimo, Don Luigi, and Rita are four of Dr. Evil's henchmen who appear at the very beginning of the first film, along with Frau Farbissina and Mustafa. Because they all failed to kill Austin Powers, Dr. Evil presses the button on his table that causes their chairs to flip back and send them into a pit of fire, incinerating all four of them, while sparing the lives of Frau and Mustafa. =Fembots= * Portrayed by: Cheryl Bartel (Cheryl Butner Klein), Cindy Margolis, Donna W. Scott, Barbara Moore, Cynthia Lamontagne * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Blofeld's \\"Angels of Death\\" in On Her Majesty's Secret Service The Fembots are extremely- seductive female robots with breast cannons. Frau Farbissina uses them to seduce Austin, with intentions of killing him. Her plan almost works, but Austin does an exaggerated striptease in response, which drives them beyond their sex limit which causes their heads to explode. Vanessa Kensington is revealed to be a Fembot in the beginning of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. A Fembot version of Britney Spears also makes an appearance in Goldmember, before being destroyed by Austin. Other characters =The President= * Portrayed by: Tim Robbins * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me The President is the unnamed president of the United States. (In 1969, the real president would be Richard Nixon.) In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Dr. Evil communicates with him via closed circuit TV. Evil plays him a scene from the film Independence Day to show what his laser can do if the President does not hand over one hundred billion dollars. The demand makes the President and his advisors laugh, as they do not believe that much money even exists. Dr. Evil continues to demand that the President show him the money, but the President continues to plead that they do not have it. The President does not appear again in Goldmember. =Johnson Ritter= * Portrayed by: Clint Howard * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Austin Powers in Goldmember Johnson Ritter is a radar operator who often says a line that leads up to something funny. In the first movie, he is the one who spotted Dr. Evil's ship and informed Commander Gilmour about it. In the third movie, he sees a similar thing; he is about to quote that it looks like a pair of breasts, but is interrupted by a vendor who shouts \\"melons\\" to advertise the melons she has for sale (a play on the slang term for breasts). He appears in all of the movies but only has a few lines in each of them, and what appears on his radar screen is always shown completely clearly. =General Hawk= * Portrayed by: Charles Napier * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me General Hawk is an advisor to the president. He is notable for asking the president if he was suggesting that they blow up the moon, with the president replying to him and the other generals in the room, \\"Would you miss it?\\" General Hawk is the second character in the series who is portrayed by Charles Napier; the other one is Commander Gilmour. =General Clark= * Portrayed by: Kevin Cooney * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember General Clark is military general. In the third film, he is talking to Johnson Ritter about a satellite that appears out of orbit. Johnson is about to say it looks like something, but is interrupted by a repeated joke from the second film, this time with breasts rather than a penis and testicles. This part of the movie features a cameo by Ozzy Osbourne, who claims that it looks like a pair of boobs and points out that the joke was used in the previous film. =Mr. Roboto= * Portrayed by: Nobu Matsuhisa * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember * Based on: Mr. Osato in You Only Live Twice Mr. Roboto is a Japanese businessman, owner of Roboto Industries. He helps Dr. Evil and Goldmember work on their tractor beam. Earlier in the film, he is seen making an exchange with Fat Bastard, who later tells Austin and Foxxy what he is working on with Dr. Evil and Goldmember. Later, the duo confronts him, and he claims he has no idea what they are talking about, which does not convince them. Later in the film, when the tractor beam is complete, Mr. Roboto asks Dr. Evil for a raise in his paycheck via Japanese custom, but he is instead eaten by sharks without being paid at all. He speaks partially in Japanese with English subtitles, but his office, which mostly contains white furniture washes out part of the meaning of the subtitles. Austin is offended at the suggestion he might have said \\"Please eat some shit,\\" and \\"I have a huge rod\\" when he actually said \\"Please eat some shitake mushrooms,\\" and \\"I have a huge rodent problem.\\" Austin contradicts his earlier confusion by speaking a phrase of his own in Japanese: \\"I DO have a huge rod...I wish.\\" =Ming Tea= * Portrayed by: Susanna Hoffs (Gillian Shagwell), Stuart D. Johnson (Manny Stixsman/As Stuart Johnson), Matthew Sweet (Sid Belvedere), Christopher Ward (Trevor Aigberth) * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Austin Powers in Goldmember Gillian Shagwell, Manny Stixsman, Sid Belvedere, and Trevor Aigberth compose Ming Tea, Austin's band. In Austin Powers in Goldmember, Austin sings with his band the song \\"Daddy Wasn't There\\" (as shown in the respective music video, interspersed with other clips from the film) at his pad after Austin's disappointing knighting, in which his father did not show up for him. =Fook Mi and Fook Yu= * Portrayed by: Diane Mizota (Mi) and Carrie Ann Inaba (Yu) * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember Cindy Fook \\"Mi\\" and Sally Fook \\"Yu\\" are teenage Japanese twins (despite their more stereotypically Chinese name; it may be assumed that they have Chinese ancestry). The two of them speak with and flirt with Austin at the beginning of the film while they are at his party, which involves Fook Mi's asking for Austin's autograph and Austin's replying with such statements as, \\"Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?\\" and with admonitions to watch her language (of course not immediately noticing that is her name). Fook Yu is introduced to Austin by her sister after a moment or two. A deleted scene of the film actually reveals that their true names are Cindy and Sally, and that they only use Mi and Yu because of the wordplay with their names. =Dixie Normous= * Portrayed by: Gwyneth Paltrow * Appears in: Austin Powers in Goldmember Dixie Normous is a woman whom Austin meets at the beginning of the third film, while he is at the party. A movie titled Austinpussy was in production, and she is the lead role in it, alongside Tom Cruise, who is playing Austin. She flirts with Austin for a short time. =The Texan= * Portrayed by: Tom Arnold * Appears in: Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery * Based on: Willard Whyte The Texan is an unnamed man wearing a cowboy hat who is seen in the first film talking to Austin in the casino restroom. He is in the stall next to the one Austin goes in, and contributes to one of the most famous scenes of the film. Paddy O'Brien pops out of a vent above Austin in an attempt to strangle him with his charm bracelet. Austin and O'Brien struggle inside the stall, making many strange noises. The Texan can hear every noise, but can only see Austin's feet moving frantically, making him think Austin is having trouble on the toilet. He continuously provides Austin with advice and other helpful hints. At some point, Austin manages to get O'Brien trapped in-between his legs and hold him above the toilet bowl, asking him, \\"Do you work for Number 2?\\" (\\"Who does Number 2 work for?\\" in later pressings of the film). The Texan, confused by this, tells him to \\"show that turd who's boss.\\" When he exits the stall, the Texan sees O'Brien's dead body and asks, \\"Jesus Christ boy! What did you eat?!\\" =Una Brau= * Portrayed by: Mary Jo Smith * Appears in: Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Una Brau is Frau Farbissina's love interest in the second film. She and Frau met on the LPGA tour and fell in love. She does not speak, and has a unibrow, hence her name.

The attack According to episode \\"A.K.A.\\", the attacks destroyed twenty-three major American cities. The bombs used in the attacks were brought in by the U.S. government. After the Soviet Union fell, neglected military and the satellite republics started selling their nuclear stockpiles on the black market. So the Central Intelligence Agency started an operation: \\"Project Red Bell\\". The objective of the project was to obtain that material by any and all means necessary, but a few years before the events of the series a shipment disappeared on its way to the Department of Energy storage compound in Oak Ridge. Those warheads were converted into twenty-five 20-kiloton devices, which were disseminated to extremist cells active within the United States. It was a cross-section of \\"domestic militia, anarchists and religious fanatics\\" - terrorist groups that would never ordinarily collaborate, ideologically or politically. The only thing that connected them was the desire to take down the federal government of the United States. The entire plan was orchestrated by someone with deep resources, an ability to coordinate diverse groups and by all indications, an American. After someone (believed to be Thomas Valente) tipped off the terrorists about the government's knowledge of the plot, they moved up the timetable for the attacks. As described in the episode \\"The Day Before\\", the attacks were to take place simultaneously, using the 20-kiloton nuclear devices hidden in 55-gallon oil drums, at 8:05 p.m. EDT, during the U.S. President's emergency address to Congress on Tuesday, September 19. The Black Jack map of rumored capitals and nuclear attacks Darcy Hawkins states in the episode \\"Casus Belli\\" that 30 million people were killed outright in the attacks. A news report in the second season premiere episode, \\"Reconstruction\\", says that \\"over 15 million\\" were \\"left dead or dying\\" and \\"another 40 million homeless.\\" =Cities reportedly attacked= Cities are identified within the show as having been attacked, mainly through a series of maps maintained by a number of characters tracking the destroyed cities. In the episode \\"A.K.A.\\", it was stated that there were 25 explosive devices. Twenty-four cities are identified as being attacked, however it is also known that Columbus, Ohio (\\"The Day Before\\"), New York City (\\"Long Live the Mayor\\") and St Louis, Missouri (\\"The Day Before\\") were targeted. It is not known if the error lies with the initial number of explosive devices, or incorrect knowledge of the characters on the show. The attacked cities are listed below, along with the episodes in which the references to the city are made. * Atlanta, Georgia (1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 14, 18) * Baltimore, Maryland (13, 18, OVS) * Boston, Massachusetts (13, 14) * Charlotte, North Carolina (13, 14, 18) * Chicago, Illinois (2, 3, 6, 13, 14, 18) * Dallas, Texas (3, 6, 13, 18) * Denver, Colorado (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 18) * Detroit, Michigan (6, 13, 14, 18) * Hartford, Connecticut (13, 14, 18) * Houston, Texas (13, 18) * Lawrence, Kansas (initially reported as Kansas City) (3, 4, 7, 13, 14, 18) * Indianapolis, Indiana (17, 19, 20) * Los Angeles, California (3, 13, 18) * Miami, Florida (13, 14?, 18) * Minneapolis, Minnesota (6, 13, 14, 18) * Norfolk, Virginia (18) * Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2, 6, 13, 14, 18) * Phoenix, Arizona (13, 18) * Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (13, 14, 18) * St. George or Cedar City, Utah (13, 14) * San Diego, California (2, 6, 13, 18) * San Francisco, California (3, 13, 18) * Seattle, Washington (3, 6?, 13, 18) * Washington, D.C. (7, 13, 14, 18, OVS) Sources: *Episode 1 (\\"Pilot\\") - The mushroom cloud over Denver is seen in Jericho. Later, Dale Turner listens to a voicemail message from his mother in Atlanta, which is cut off by an explosion. *Episode 2 (\\"Fallout\\") - Robert Hawkins' map in his basement is seen for the first time. He is seen marking cities with push pins. *Episode 3 (\\"Four Horsemen\\") - Part of a Chinese news broadcast is seen on the television in Bailey's Tavern. A map of the United States is shown with some cities marked with red dots. The cities are marked with Chinese characters in the approximate locations of Atlanta (‰∫öÁâπÂÖ∞Â§ß), Chicago (ËäùÂä†Âì•), Dallas (ËææÊãâÊñØ), Denver (‰∏π‰Ωõ), Los Angeles (Ê¥õÊùâÁü∂), New York City (Á∫ΩÁ∫¶), San Francisco (ÊóßÈáëÂ±±) and Seattle (Ë•øÈõÖÂõæ). All of these apart from New York are corroborated with evidence from future episodes. Airplane pilots recordings also mention clouds over Denver, Kansas City (actually Lawrence), and South, somewhere in Texas, possibly Dallas. *Episode 4 (\\"The Walls of Jericho\\") - A map at the bar shows Denver and Kansas City as bombed, while some found footage is uncertainly guessed as Cincinnati *Episode 6 (\\"9:02\\") - Robert Hawkins' map in his basement is seen again, found by his daughter. Further cities are marked with push pins. *Episode 7 (\\"Long Live the Mayor\\") - Gray Anderson returns from his travels with further news about the attacks, mentioning Lawrence, Washington D.C., and New York. *Episode 13 (\\"Black Jack\\") - In a visit to the Black Jack Fairgrounds, a map is seen with attacked cities marked with red dots. Sarah Mason mentions seeing clouds on Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. *Episode 14 (\\"Heart of Winter\\") - Robert and Sarah Mason visit the 'Old Man' and see a map similar to the one in Robert's basement. *Episode 18 (\\"A.K.A.\\") - Robert's basement map is seen once again, with additional cities marked. *Online Video Segment - In the \\"Ask the Mystery Woman\\" online video segments , Sarah mentions both the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. blasts. Some facts stated on the show contradict other evidence: *Episode 3 (\\"Four Horsemen\\") - On a cockpit voice recorder recovered by Jake Green, pilots are heard discussing mushroom clouds \\"somewhere in Texas\\", over Denver, and over Kansas City. There has not been evidence of a Kansas City attack elsewhere in the series, but there have been multiple reports of an attack at nearby Lawrence. *Episode 12 (\\"The Day Before\\") - In a flashback to the day before the attacks, Sarah is seen reading a list of intended target cities on Hawkins' laptop. As it can not be assumed that all bombs hit their targets, this can not be used as evidence of an attack. Of the eight cities displayed, there is additional evidence in other episodes of six (Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas and Chicago) having been attacked, and New York having survived an attempted attack. No definite evidence either way has been presented regarding St. Louis, which was also reported to have possibly been attacked. *Episode 19 (\\"Casus Belli\\") - Darcy Hawkins, monitoring radio broadcasts, mentions a report that the Chicago West refugee camp has continuing riots; but this does not imply that Chicago survived. =Cities with unconfirmed status= Some cities were assumed to have been attacked in early episodes, but have been absent from later episodes. It is unknown if there are production and continuity issues, or simply a result of the poor communication infrastructure in the Jericho universe. * Cincinnati, Ohio: In \\"Walls of Jericho\\", Eric suggests that it may have been Cincinnati's skyline seen in a looped reel of news footage. An attack on the city is not supported by any other source. * Kansas City, Missouri: Although a pilot on the cockpit voice recorder tape describes seeing a mushroom cloud over Kansas City, an explosion in Kansas City is not supported by any other source. Given the proximity of Lawrence, Kansas, to Kansas City (40 miles), it is likely that the explosion in Lawrence could have been mistaken for Kansas City by the pilot. * New Orleans, Louisiana: In \\"9:02\\", a pin marking New Orleans appears in Robert Hawkins' map, but disappears from some shots. It is not in any maps in future episodes. * St. Louis, Missouri: In \\"The Day Before\\", St. Louis appears in Robert Hawkins' computer list of intended terrorist targets. However, there is no evidence of either an attack, or a foiled attempt, on the city. It is not marked on any maps. Airline pilots, heard on a retrieved cockpit voice recorder, see F-16s and believe they belong to a Missouri Air National Guard unit based in St. Louis. =Cities that reportedly survived= *Cheyenne, Wyoming, indicated in dialogue as a city where Heather may be taken by the military after she is rescued from a car accident. According to the episode \\"Reconstruction\\", Cheyenne is the capital of a partially reunited America, the Allied States of America. It is also mentioned in the 2nd season episode \\"Jennings & Rall\\" that the city's population has swollen to over 800,000 and in the episode \\"Sedition\\" Jake states that over a million is living there. *Columbus, Ohio, was written on the card given to Hawkins in episode 13, and was the target city to where he was to deliver his bomb. Since Hawkins never delivered the bomb, Columbus was spared. Columbus was also seen as a regional capital on the Blackjack Fairgrounds map. The fake Marines in \\"Semper Fidelis\\" said that the government was re-organizing in Columbus, but this was put in doubt after their fraud was discovered before being finally put to rest in \\"Why We Fight\\". In Reconstruction it was found out that Columbus had indeed become the capital of the East and is home to the remnants of the old U.S. government. *Las Vegas, Nevada at least partially survived, based on information from Dr. Dhuwalia in episode 9. However, according to him with electrical power and national supply routes cut, Las Vegas has become isolated in the desert and without adequate supplies, to the point that Dr. Dhuwalia was desperate to leave. *Lexington, Kentucky  In the CBS web feature, \\"Ask The Mystery Woman\\", she mentions \\"Lexington Camp,\\" a refugee camp outside of Lexington, Kentucky. She says that if one made it to Lexington Camp, then they were in pretty good shape. *McCook, Nebraska: Hawkins arranges a meeting at a warehouse in McCook in One Man's Terrorist (although the geographic coordinates at one point refer to Lincoln, Nebraska) *New York City was originally reported as attacked in the Chinese broadcast (marked: Á¥êÁ¥Ñ), but was later reported as spared by Gray Anderson. Gray reports the capture of three men in a rental truck who were in possession of a 20-kiloton nuclear device in a steel drum, moments before the device could be detonated. (The New York arrests are credited to heightened security following the September 11, 2001 attacks. It should also be noted that according to the episode \\"A.K.A.\\", Robert Hawkins warned his superiors of the attack and gave them plate numbers of the white vans used in the attacks. This is most likely what prevented the detonation of the New York bomb.) New York was also not marked on the Black Jack map. A radio report from Episode 18 confirms New York was spared. *Richmond, Virginia was the home or rally point for one of the members of Hawkins' team. In Heart of Winter, Hawkins finds photos indicating the family was murdered there after the attacks. *The fictional Rogue River, Kansas was evacuated by Ravenwood Security to a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) tent-city about a month after the explosion in Denver. After a FEMA flyer cited contaminated groundwater as a result of the nuclear fallout from Lawrence, Kansas, as the reason for the evacuation. *Santa Fe, New Mexico, it is indicated that Major Beck's wife was in Santa Fe during the attack and has lost contact with her. *In \\"Black Jack\\", it was noted that Tallahassee, Florida survived, since, as the capital of Florida, it was supporting the president in Montgomery, Alabama. *Topeka, Kansas, is described as the source of the Homeland Security telephone calls in the fifth episode, indicating that Topeka has at least partly survived. Gray Anderson reported that FEMA had set up just outside Topeka and was attacked as they were leaving the city in a FEMA truck. The counter-attack In \\"Reconstruction\\", Allied States television and Chavez confirm the rumor from \\"Semper Fidelis\\" that Iran and North Korea were destroyed with nuclear weapons as a counter-attack for the destruction of the U.S. cities. While the Allied States' official position is that Iran and North Korea were behind the attacks, Chavez shares Hawkins' suspicion that the terrorists were purely domestic and that Iran and North Korea were scapegoats. Regional capitals In the episode \\"Black Jack\\", the following cities were marked on a map made available at Black Jack Fairgrounds.\\"Jericho Wiki: Attack Timeline\\" * Columbus, Ohio - The fake Marines in \\"Semper Fidelis\\" say that Columbus has become the new U.S. capital, but they later admit that what they said was based only on rumors. In \\"Reconstruction\\" this is confirmed; but Columbus only controls the states east of the Mississippi. * Rome, New York \\\\- later united with Columbus * Montgomery, Alabama - later united with Columbus * San Antonio, Texas - capital of independent Texas; siding with Columbus as of the end of Season 2. * Cheyenne, Wyoming - capital of the new Allied States of America, controlling the western states except Texas. * Sacramento, California - later united with Cheyenne, according to \\"Reconstruction\\" In the season finale episode \\"Why We Fight\\", it is stated there are three United States federal governments. Colonel Hoffman appears to be taking orders from a government based in Cheyenne, Wyoming, led by Senator Tomarchio, mentioned as leading one of the factions in \\"Black Jack\\"; this becomes the Allied States of America. Holdouts are described as \\"a bloc in the east (coast)\\" and Texas. The second season opener \\"Reconstruction\\" confirms that Sacramento and the rest of the western U.S. have joined up with Cheyenne's ASA, while Montgomery, Rome, and the rest of the eastern U.S. have rallied behind Columbus, leaving Texas as the only significant holdout. The \\"Blue Line\\" is a United Nations buffer zone along the Mississippi River, keeping the peace between Cheyenne and Columbus. The ASA's flag shows 13 vertical stripes, representing the 13 founding colonies as before, but signifying that the new government is taking a \\"new direction\\"; and 21 stars, one for each State west of the Mississippi excluding Texas, Hawaii and Alaska. (Texas is independent; the status of Alaska and Hawaii is not known.) Rogue River, Kansas  Rogue River is the county seat of the fictional Fillmore County, and is located roughly 90 miles east of Jericho. It is a mid-sized city with a county hospital. FEMA evacuated the city after nearby Lawrence, Kansas, was targeted during a nuclear attack. The city is deserted, and all the living people are evacuated to a tent city.  New Bern, Kansas  New Bern is a city near Jericho. The town manager is Phil Constantino, who is also the sheriff. New Bern's land is mostly clay, so its citizens have no way of growing crops. After the attacks, New Bern asks for ten percent of Jericho's spring crop, along with salt, in exchange for ten wind turbines. Ten Jericho men are taken to New Bern to help make the turbines, a gesture interpreted by Jericho's mayor, Gray Anderson, as a passive hostage-taking as collateral for Jericho's fulfilling its part of the deal. When all but one (Eric Green), plus a citizen present in New Bern previously (Heather Lisinski), of the Jericho citizens suddenly return from New Bern with the generators, Jake Green and Robert Hawkins, go to New Bern to look for the missing people. There they discover that New Bern's leaders are planning a military-style attack on Jericho, having converted their factory into a munitions plant. Many buildings in the town, including the city hall, were heavily damaged by Ravenwood private military contractors, an attack residents blame on Jericho's having successfully repelled Ravenwood some time earlier. Residents have been told that Jericho is hoarding supplies. Hostilities between New Bern and Jericho increase after New Bern attacks Jericho with mortars in an attempt to annex several of Jericho's outlying farms. The situation escalates, and in the season finale, New Bern launches a full assault on Jericho. At the start of season 2, the Cheyenne Government stops the skirmish and forces a cease-fire. After Major Beck determines that New Bern was the instigator of the skirmish, the town of New Bern remains in lockdown with curfews and extensive military checkpoints. Gunmen from New Bern enter Jericho on numerous occasions, almost gunning down a Jericho citizen in broad daylight. Heather is appointed as liaison between Jericho and New Bern in an effort to further promote peace and reconciliation.

Shortly after the disbanding of the stable, the Team Cage name was used at TNA's Lockdown for Christian's teams. The Christian Coalition name was recycled from Christian and Tomko in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where they referred to Christian's fan base as the Christian Coalition.  History  = Formation = Reprising that shared role between the two started from 2004-2005 in WWE, Christian Cage originally brought Tomko in to TNA as a personal enforcer in late-2006 to help him regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. It proved a smart move on his part when Tomko helped him defeat reigning champion Abyss and Sting in a triple threat elimination match at the January 2007 Final Resolution pay-per-view event. During the same event, Kurt Angle became the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight title and moved into a feud with Cage. To prepare for his match with Angle, Cage brought Scott Steiner in as a \\"trainer\\", citing an intense dislike Steiner had for Angle at the time (which Steiner later explained as all contract negotiations involving himself having been put on indefinite hold by Angle's coming to TNA). This also proved to be good strategy when the \\"Christian Coalition\\", as the three men now referred to themselves, helped Cage retain his title at February's Against All Odds. Although all three men were working together on Cage's behalf, from the start there was dissension evident. Tomko frequently commented on his distrust and dislike of Steiner, and after he won a match over new number one contender Samoa Joe on an episode of Impact!, Tomko began demanding a shot at Cage's title. Later he took a (kayfabe) sudden trip to Japan (which had actually been set up well in advance, to compete for the IWGP Tag Team Championship along with Giant Bernard) that coincided with the Destination X pay-per-view. During the event Steiner also abandoned Cage prior to his main event match, forcing him to seek out a replacement enforcer for the event. He would be unsuccessful in that venture, yet still manage to defeat Samoa Joe to retain his NWA World Heavyweight title. = Team Cage (2007) = Immediately following Destination X, Cage and Kurt Angle were informed by TNA management director Jim Cornette that they would each be captaining five-man teams to compete in a Lethal Lockdown cage match at the upcoming PPV Lockdown. In the upcoming weeks, the Coalition got back together as part of a bigger unit under the name \\"Team Cage\\" (also including Abyss and A.J. Styles), while Team Angle went on to comprise Angle, Joe, Sting (to counter Abyss), Rhino (to counter Styles), and Jeff Jarrett. At the match itself, Team Angle won when Jarrett hit Abyss with a thumbtack-loaded guitar and let Sting make the pin to become number one contender to Cage's title. The following Impact!, after Cage and Abyss failed to take the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Team 3D, Abyss was kicked off the team with a beating involving steel chairs and a barbed wire baseball bat. Soon after Tomko and Steiner began chasing the NWA World Tag Team Championship culminating in a 3 Way tag team match at TNA Sacrifice with The Latin American Exchange (LAX) which they lost. Shortly afterwards, Tomko and Steiner had communication problems which caused Rick Steiner to help his brother attack Tomko. Claiming trust issues prior to the event, Scott Steiner turned to family and left Team Cage, following which they began to be referred to once again as \\"Christian's Coalition\\". On May 31, 2007 A.J. Styles defeated Tomko in a King of the Mountain qualifying match thanks to a distraction from Christian Cage. = The Coalition with A.J. Styles and Tomko = TNA World Tag Team Champions On June 14, Cage's qualifying opponent was Abyss, who had laid out Tomko and stopped him from coming out for an earlier match on which Styles would be on the opposite side. With Styles and Tomko's help, Cage won by disqualification after Abyss hit him with a steel chair and managed to escape the monster. At Slammiversary, Tomko lost to Abyss in a no DQ match after taking a Black Hole Slam through broken glass, and both Styles and Christian lost the King of the Mountain match. Christian would then enter into a feud with \\"the Wildcat\\" Chris Harris, while the Coalition continued feuding with Sting and Abyss. At Victory Road, Cage defeated Harris, but Styles and Tomko lost to Sting and Abyss. Robert Roode had a match with Christian's Coalition on the last Impact! before Victory Road, and was seen trying to help them on the first Impact after. On July 26, Mike Tenay cited Roode as a member of Christian's Coalition. Acting as such in helping them lay out Sting and Abyss, Roode seemed to be competing with A.J. Styles for Christian's right hand status. However, he appeared apart from the group in all the immediate weeks after, with no mention of Roode and manager Ms. Brooks being in the Coalition. This suggests they were more of allies than members of the Coalition. In addition, Sting and Abyss secured a contract for an Abyss vs. Christian match at Hard Justice 2007 with the help of the TNA debut of \\"The Punisher\\" Andrew Martin to counteract Tomko's role in the Coalition as an enforcer. At the Impact! prior to Hard Justice, Jim Cornette announced that Christian's Coalition would take on Abyss, Sting and Andrew Martin in a Doomsday Chamber of Blood match at Hard Justice in which the wrestler who scores the pinfall for his team in the match would receive the next title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This was a barbed wire six sides of steel cage match that could only be won by pinning an opponent after they've been busted open. At Hard Justice, Christian's Coalition was defeated, as Abyss pinned A.J. Styles for the win. After this, Christian and his Coalition would move into a feud with Samoa Joe over who the \\"real World Heavyweight Champion\\" is, having both been screwed out of the title to Angle's benefit in recent weeks. On the September 6 episode of Impact!, the forgotten alliance with Robert Roode was decisively ended, as he and Tomko got into a momentary heated confrontation over his treatment of Ms. Brooks. At No Surrender, Styles and Tomko would win the a 10 Team Gauntlet Match to become the number one contenders for the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Bound for Glory against the team of Adam \\"Pacman\\" Jones and Ron \\"the Truth\\" Killings. Cage would defeat Joe by disqualification at the same event. Bound For Glory was bittersweet for the Coalition, as A.J. Styles and Tomko defeated Killings and Rasheed Lucius \\"Consequences\\" Creed (substituting for Jones, who would instead manage his team that night) for the TNA Tag Team Titles, but Samoa Joe (with Matt Morgan as the special enforcer) would defeat Cage via submission with the Coquina Clutch, ending Christian's TNA-record 23 month streak of not being pinned or forced to submit since arriving in TNA. = Split and feud with Angle Alliance = alt=Adult white male wearing black and white wrestling gear doing hand symbols. After retaining the tag titles against The Steiner Brothers at Genesis, Styles and Tomko came out during Christian's number one contendership ladder match with Kaz right as Cage was about to win, despite his specific instructions not to. This distracted Cage, costing him the match. Immediately after, they would assist Kurt Angle in retaining his TNA World Heavyweight Championship, officially joining Kurt and his wife Karen in the Angle Alliance. From there, Styles and a very skeptical Tomko would attempt, despite the clashing egos and animosity between Christian and the Angles, to be part of both the Angle Alliance and the Christian Coalition. Meanwhile, Cage momentarily found an ally in Robert Roode, goading Roode into a feud with Booker T, before that quickly broke down at the Turning Point PPV. The next Impact! Roode and Cage joined Angle's group, though Christian's membership came on the condition that he became leader of all five of them. Surprisingly, Angle accepted with only momentary hesitation. The newly united stable first worked together for the main event later that evening, but after miscommunication cost them the match, Christian argued with and was attacked by Roode and Angle as Styles tried to hold them back and Tomko just walked away. Christian was clearly out of the Angle Alliance, but status was unknown for Styles and Tomko as far as either the Alliance or the Coalition. On Impact the week after Cage was again attacked by Angle and Roode but this time an upset looking Styles just watched from the ring apron. In the weeks since, Tomko made it clear to Styles that they needed to choose sides, and while Styles had been indecisive to no end, Tomko firmly established his own foothold in the situation by leaving both the Coalition and the Alliance on the January 3, 2008 edition of Impact. At Final Resolution, after being seduced in a bathroom stall by Kurt's wife Karen Angle, Styles helped Kurt Angle defeat Cage, making his decision to leave the Coalition. Tomko put the final nail in the Coalition's coffin when he helped Angle defeat Cage at Against All Odds 2008 and announced on the following edition of Impact! that he was officially joining the Angle Alliance. Christian would attempt to enact revenge by banding together with new number one contender Samoa Joe and Joe's new adviser Kevin Nash in a group he called the \\"Unlikely Alliance\\". = Team Cage (2008) = Following the Unlikely Alliance's win over the Angle Alliance in a six-man tag team match at Destination X 2008, Christian Cage and Tomko would be assigned to captain opposing teams for the next Lethal Lockdown match at the next pay-per-view, Lockdown. In response to Tomko acquiring Team 3D to join him and A.J., Christian and Kevin Nash's new Team Cage was assembled by reconciling Cage's issues with Rhino (stemming from Christian's pre-Coalition villainous turn in 2006), bringing back the icon Sting from his latest hiatus, and enlisting Matt Morgan to trick Team Tomko by allowing James Storm to join their ranks a week after attacking Sting, only so Morgan could turn around and join Team Cage himself at the end of that same Impact!. At Lockdown Team Cage won after Rhino hit Storm with the Gore. The group instantly dissolved into separate units soon thereafter, seemingly ending the story of the Christian Coalition/Team Cage once and for all with longtime friends Christian Cage and Rhino, whose initial falling out in 2006 led to Christian turning against the fans and forming the Coalition, now forming a regular tag team. Later on, due to having common enemies in Kurt Angle, Team 3D, Booker T and Tomko, Christian and Rhino would also reconcile with A.J. Styles, as the three of them became loose allies. Tomko, meanwhile, later left TNA for Japan, but ended up coming back for one last appearance against Samoa Joe when many of his Inoki Genome Federation (IGF) bookings were canceled. Christian left afterward to sign back with WWE.  Members  * Christian Cage (leader) = Christian's Coalition = * A.J.

Compton House is a historic house at 5637 South Woodlawn Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1905 and designed by architects Holabird & Roche, it was the residence of physicist Arthur Compton (1892‚Äì1962) from 1928 until 1945. Compton discovered the Compton Effect in 1923, proving that light has both a particle and a wave aspect. Compton received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for this discovery. His house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Description and history The Arthur H. Compton House is located in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood, northeast of the University of Chicago campus. It is located on the east side of South Woodlawn Avenue, between East 56th and East 57th Streets. It is an architecturally undistinguished 2-1/2 story brick building with a gabled roof. A flat-roof single-story enclosed porch extends across the front, with a chimney rising in front of the ridge between the porch and main block. The main entrance is on the right side of the house. The interior follows a central hall plan, and has been little altered since Compton's period of ownership. Compton, a native of Wooster, Ohio, was educated at Wooster College and Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in physics. In 1919, as a fellow of the National Research Council, he spent a year in England, where he participated in X-ray scattering experiments at Cavendish Laboratory. In 1923 he joined the faculty of the University of Chicago, where he continued to research X-ray scattering, and in 1923 published his groundbreaking paper on the Compton Effect. He later supported the efforts of Enrico Fermi to harness nuclear power, supporting advances for its use in both military and civilian applications.

Early life Bligh Bond was the son of the Rev. Frederick Hookey Bond. He was born in the Wiltshire town of Marlborough. His family was related to William Bligh, through his nephew Francis Godolphin Bond, Bligh Bond's grandfather. He was also a cousin of Sabine Baring-Gould. (Free registration required) He was educated at home by his father, who was headmaster of the Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School.The Rediscovery of Glastonbury: Frederick Bligh Bond Architect of the New Age by Tim Hopkinson- Ball, 2007 Architectural practice Bligh Bond's Cossham Memorial Hospital He practised as an architect in Bristol from 1888. His work includes schools, such as the board schools in Barton Hill, Easton, and Southville, Greenbank Elementary School and St George's School. He designed the schools of medicine and engineering at Bristol University and the Music School of Clifton College. He also undertook a number of domestic commissions for the King's Weston estate of Philip Napier Miles, including a number of substantial houses in Shirehampton, the Miles Arms public house in Avonmouth, the now-demolished King's Weston estate office and the public hall in Shirehampton. Cossham Memorial Hospital is also an example of his work. The style of his mature works in the Edwardian years might be described as English Baroque or Queen Anne Revival. In addition he oversaw the restoration of a number of churches, became an acknowledged authority on the history of church architecture, and in 1909 published, with Dom Bede Camm, a two-volume treatise entitled Roodscreens and Roodlofts. Glastonbury excavations Glastonbury Abbey As early as 1899 Bligh Bond had expressed his belief that the dimensions of the buildings at Glastonbury Abbey were based on gematria, and in 1917 he published, with Thomas Simcox Lea, Gematria, A Preliminary Investigation of the Cabala contained in the Coptic Gnostic Books and of a similar Gematria in the Greek text of the New Testament, which incorporated his own previously published paper, The Geometric Cubit as a Basis of Proportion in the Plans of Mediaeval Buildings. In 1908 the Church of England appointed him director of excavations at Glastonbury Abbey. Before he was dismissed by Bishop Armitage Robinson in 1921, his excavations rediscovered the nature and dimensions of a number of buildings that had occupied the site. Bond's work at Glastonbury Abbey is one of the first documented examples of psychic archaeology. Bond with the retired navy Captain John Allan Bartlett (\\"John Alleyne\\") as a medium claimed to have contacted through automatic writing dead monks and the builder of the Edgar Chapel at Glastonbury, who advised him where to excavate.Feder, Kenneth.

Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File Inc. p. 39. In 1919 he published The Gates of Remembrance, which revealed that he had employed psychical methods to guide his excavation of the Glastonbury ruins. As a consequence of these revelations his relations with his employers, who strongly disapproved of spiritualism, deteriorated and he was sacked in 1921.Anderson, Rodger. (2006).

He seeks solace through secretly observing or following people, and at night overcomes fear by cradling his most precious possession, his sounding lead. Svartman's obsessions and growing distrust of others leads him to submerge himself in a web of deceit involving his employer, Kristina and Sara which increasingly threatens to engulf him. Repection Writing in The New York Times, Lucy Ellmann criticised the novel's style, deprecating Mankell's writing as \\"woolly\\" and \\"staccato\\" and his use of metaphor and symbolism as overwrought.

The unrest began as the recently suspended chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry arrived at the Jinnah International Airport on 12 May 2007. Gunfights and clashes erupted across the provincial capital as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Awami National Party (ANP), and Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PMAP) activists, who supported the judge, and the pro-government Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) activists took to the streets against each other. Government machinery was used to block all major roads. Police was accomplice and a silent spectator to the violence. News media was attacked at Guru mandir (Business Recorder Road) when MQM activists began firing at AAJ TV headquarters which was shown on live television. Chaudhry's supporters had announced a public rally to welcome the judge while at the same time, the MQM also announced a demonstration of their own to protest against the politicisation of the issue of judge's suspension. The MQM made plans to deliberately converge at the mausoleum of Muhammad Ali Jinnah where the chief justice was to make an appearance to address a lawyers' convention and a bar association meeting at the 50th anniversary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association. Before the citywide riots escalated, several roads were cordoned off and all routes to the airport were blocked to avoid clashes between groups. In the carnage that ensued, armed groups did a lot of carnage, cars were burnt and buildings smashed into while the ensuing gunfights left more than 40 people killed with several hundred injured and arrested. The violence continued for several days, culminating in events that led to the historic Lawyers' Movement. Several lawmakers and analysts have since questioned the incompetence of the city's security apparatus on the day of the riots and the complicity of MQM in giving rise to the riots. The MQM officially denied starting the chaos and blamed it on the PPP, ANP, PMAP, Punjabi Pakhtun Ittehad (PPI) and Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) activists. Background Iftikhar Chaudhry was widely expected to try and insist Musharraf (above) stand down as army chief. The judge had also taken on several other cases that upset the government for which he was suspended from his post as chief justice. In the first few months of 2007, several conflicts had already raged between chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry and the Pakistani government, particularly with regard to the Pakistan Steel Mills corruption case where the chief justice ruled against the sale of the state- owned steel mills at a \\"throw-away price\\". Issues pertaining to the privatisation of the state-owned steel mills upset Shaukat Aziz, who served as the prime minister under the Musharraf administration. What irked president Pervez Musharraf however was the controversial Missing Persons case that found Pakistan's intelligence agencies (including the FIA and the ISI) to be complicit in the forced disappearances of up to 400 people (including terror suspects and human rights activists) without due process since 2001. Under Chaudhry's leadership, the courts had increasingly started \\"exercising independence from the government\\" when it ordered the security agencies to produce the missing people in court. When the Musharraf administration asked the judge to quit, Chaudhry refused to go. On 9 March 2007, Musharraf had no other choice but to suspend Chaudhry from his post for alleged and unspecified charges of misconduct and misuse of authority. The sacking of the head of the judiciary sparked bloody protests throughout Pakistan and \\"edged the country towards a constitutional crisis\\". The civil unrest grew with regards to the validity of the allegations as well as doubts as to whether Musharraf had the power to suspend the chief justice. It was on these grounds that Chaudhry waged a legal battle in the Supreme Court seeking his reinstatement. He called his suspension a \\"thinly veiled assault on the independence of judiciary in Pakistan\\". =Nationwide protests and media ban= On 5 May 2007, in showing solidarity with the former chief justice, a motorcade of Chaudhry's supporters rode with him from Islamabad to Lahore where he was expected to speak at the Lahore High Court Bar Association when this motorcade of over 2,000 vehicles was stopped by the police with baton charges and tear gas shelling. Debates concerning the day's events started being covered and discussed on the Pakistani news media. The government wanted to limit the media coverage of Chaudhry's rallies and asked the Supreme Court to warn news networks that any \\"media coverage, discussion and analysis\\" that impeded legal procedures would be treated as contempt of court. The court issued a statement in which it said the news media, and in particular Geo TV host Kamran Khan, had broadcast \\"sensational reporting aimed at scandalising and maligning the honourable judges of the Supreme Court\\". Khan defended his actions by saying he had no malicious intent. But when discussions of the Chaudhry's rallies persisted on television, the government decided to take drastic measures and abruptly pulled Geo TV and Aaj TV off air. It wasn't until 9 May 2007 that the Pakistani government imposed a complete ban on the media from discussing the suspension of Chaudhry by Musharraf. Media outlets and journalists protested and responded to the ban saying that their goal was to cover, not contribute, to the controversy. The government, reluctantly, agreed to issue special passes for reporters and lawyers to attend the presidential reference filed against the chief justice. Several pro-government parties throughout Pakistan announced their own demonstrations to coincide with Chaudhry's rallies. =Chaudhry's visit to Lahore High Court= In anticipation of the former chief justice's arrival in Lahore, the Lahore High Court was thronged by political activists of several political parties in the opposition including Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), who had gathered to welcome the judge. When Chaudhry did arrive at the Lahore High Court, his motorcade was swamped by supporters showering his vehicle with rose petals and chanting \\"Go Musharraf, Go!\\" Banners denouncing Musharraf were hung all around the compound. In his historical speech on 6 May 2007, the former chief justice made no direct references to president Musharraf but directed his rhetoric towards the government by calling it a \\"dictatorship\\". Several political commentators refer to this speech as the precursor to the Lawyers' Movement later that year. Chaudhry also accused the government of violating the basic human rights of its citizens and warned that the countries and nations that don't learn from past mistakes were bound to be destroyed. In closing his speech, Chaudhry announced he would be attending a Sindh High Court Bar Association meeting in Karachi on 12 May 2007. =Opposition plans to welcome Chaudhry= After Chaudhry announced his plans for Karachi, the political parties in the opposition announced a rally to welcome the former chief justice in their city. Upon seeing Chaudhry's supporters announce a rally to welcome the chief justice, the pro-government Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) organised a protest demonstration of their own against the \\"politicisation of the issue [of the justice's suspension]\\". Seeing the chief justice's determination to visit Karachi, MQM MNA Nawab Mirza proclaimed in a parliamentary session that \\"no one [would] be allowed to do anything in Karachi.\\" He said that \\"[the] country [may belong] to everyone, but Karachi [belonged] to [the MQM]\\". The provincial government called a meeting of the senior officials and instructed them to not let the chief justice leave the airport at any cost. Sindh chief secretary Shakil Durrani learnt of these plans and called them a \\"contempt of the High Court's orders\\". On 10 May 2007, Pakistan International Human Rights Organisation filed a petition with the Sindh High Court pointing out reports in the press about Sindh home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi's letter to the chief justice that requested him to postpone his visit because of intelligence reports suggesting threat of a terrorist attack. The court directed the federal and provincial governments to provide fool-proof security to the chief justice and also directed authorities not to pressurise him into changing his route while also keeping him informed of any security risks. =Unrest before Chaudhry's visit= At on 10 May 2007, the residence of the Supreme Court Bar Association president Munir A. Malik came under attack by armed men. Malik, a member of the panel of lawyers defending Chaudhry, narrowly escaped the attack. On 11 May 2007, Karachi Bar Association vice president Ziauddin Sardar was reported missing by his family. Following these incidents, uncertainty and fear gripped the city as the \\"threat of a showdown loomed large\\". Karachi Police informed it had arrested 150 people under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance on apprehensions they could \\"create problems\\" on the judge's arrival. However, opposition parties disputed the number of arrests ‚Äì MMA put the figure at 500, PPP at 400 and PML-N at 150. The day of the riots Fearing a showdown between rival political parties, the transporters in the city decided to keep their buses and vans off the road. In a late-night announcement, the Sindh government announced the closure of all educational institutions as governor Dr Ishrat- ul-Ibad Khan declared a public holiday for government and private schools, colleges and universities on 12 May 2007. Hospitals declared emergency and ordered their doctors and staff to remain on duty, while Naib Nazima Nasreen Jalil directed all city departments including hospitals and fire-brigade to follow \\"standard operating procedure\\" to deal with any emergency situation that arises. =City-wide blockades set up= Streets throughout Karachi were left deserted on the day the riots broke out bringing the provincial capital to a halt. Reports started emerging from around Karachi of blockades being set up on the way toward the Jinnah International Airport in a bid to stop the chief justice from visiting Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mausoleum. Parts of Shahrah- e-Quaideen were blocked whereas the main arterial road Shahrah-e-Faisal, which was to be used by procession of the chief justice, was completely made inaccessible. Because most of the road leading to the airport were closed, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had to delay all its flight due to the non-availability of cockpit and cabin crews who were unable to reach the airport in time. It wasn't just air traffic that was suspended but train services between Karachi and the rest of the country were also effected. =Chaudhry's arrival in Karachi= At , Chaudhry left Islamabad airport on flight PK-301 for Karachi accompanied by Zamurad Khan and Yousuf Talpur. The flight landed at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi airport at . Gunfights broke out throughout the city as soon as the plane landed at the airport; several vehicles were also set ablaze. Smoke rose from at least four different areas of the city where competing rallies were organised. The chief justice had plans to visit Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah's mausoleum to address a gathering and then to the Sindh High Court to address lawyers at the 50th anniversary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association. Due to the sudden violence that erupted throughout the city, the chief justice was unable to leave the airport. =Media offices attacked= As the violence escalated, gunfights moved toward the Guru Mandir Square in the neighbourhood of Jamshed Quarters. The offices of various media outlets, in particular the Business Recorder House which housed the Aaj TV newsroom and broadcast operations, became firsthand witnesses of the carnage. With the violence continuing right at their doorstep, Aaj TV reporters began telecasting live footage of the mayhem. The Aaj TV footage showed armed men brandishing weapons that they fired indiscriminately at rivals in an adjacent neighbourhood. The footage clearly showed these gunmen hoisting MQM flags. As soon as the footage started airing on television, the gunmen became aware they were being filmed and turned their guns towards the media offices. The armed men fired at the office building and set cars ablaze in the parking lot beside the building. The network's chief executive Arshad Zuberi later revealed that the gunmen were certainly affiliated with the MQM. He stated that the \\"gunmen started [firing] indiscriminately at [the] office [and] no security was sent [even] though the firing went on for six hours\\". According to Zuberi, the armed men had wanted to stop the airing of the live footage. Nevertheless, the network remained on air uninterrupted and no one was hurt during the attacks. In an editorial for the Daily Times, freelance journalist Urooj Zia wrote an eyewitness account of the carnage outside the Business Recorder House. She observed how the Rangers paramilitary force had let the violence continue under their noses. She mentioned how people were being stopped at gunpoint on the street by political activists and asked for identification while the police stood by idly. =Violence, carnage and mayhem= During the rampage, it was mostly the supporters of Chaudhry who lost their lives. 15 members of Awami National Party (ANP) were killed (Pashtuns make up second largest ethnic group in Karachi with 7.0 million Pashtuns living in Karachi). 14 supporters of PPP were also left dead in the massacre. More than 800 political workers were arrested, majority of whom were members of labor and student organizations that had been planning to greet Chaudhry on his arrival. =Government offers to transport Chaudhry= Unable to leave the airport, the chief justice took refuge at the airport. Knowing that roads leading up to the airport were blocked and that his leaving may further precipitate bloodshed, Chaudhry's advisers asked him to stay put. Amidst the chaos, the government agreed to send a helicopter to transport him out of the airport but Chaudhry refused, indicating that he wished to travel by ground. According to Munir A. Malik, one of the lawyers accompanying Chaudhry, Musharraf's offer to transport Chaudhry by helicopter seemed more like an attempt to \\"kidnap\\" the chief justice. =Notice to deport the chief justice= After a whole day of violence in the city, the Sindh administration issued a notification in the evening ordering the deportation of the chief justice. It was at this moment that Chaudhry \\"abandoned plans to address [his] supporters\\" and returned to Islamabad on the next flight. The chief justice was adamant that he would only leave the airport if he was provided with sufficient security and the accompaniment of his cadre of lawyers. Chaudhry's flight departed the Karachi airport at around . According to Aitzaz Ahsan, a prominent figurehead in Chaudhry's cadre, the chief justice had waited all day for permission to go to the Sindh High Court but was rather mistreated and asked to leave. He also accused the MQM of planning the mayhem in advance. Sources of contention Human Rights Watch, a non-government affiliated human rights watch dog based in New York City, recently issued a statement indicating that \\"This [violence] can either be due to the incompetence of the government, or its complicity.\\" Their statement went on, \\"The sequence of events leading up to this violence, including statements from the provincial authorities and the arrest of hundreds of opposition activists in the last few days, indicates that the government, acting through its coalition partners, has deliberately sought to foment violence in Karachi.\\" According to documents obtained by the BBC after the event, government security measures on the day of the planned demonstrations included the instruction that \\"no police personnel should carry any kind of weapon during the law and order duty with the rally\\". Of note, among police officials were deployed for security duties in Karachi, only 21 in the entire city were armed. BBC analysts have indicated that the way police were deployed indicates that they were meant to prevent people from gaining access to the airport or to the Sindh High Court. Aftermath Most of the city remained calm the day following the riots as security forces in armored personnel carriers and pickup trucks with mounted machine guns patrolled mostly peaceful and deserted streets. Tensions were still high with the government authorising paramilitary troops to shoot anyone involved in \\"serious\\" violence. Political opponents in the parliament blamed one another for the 12 May mayhem. MQM's Farooq Sattar blamed the opposition by saying that they were a \\"hundred percent, 200 percent\\" responsible for the situation in Karachi. On the other hand, opposition senator Mushahid Ullah Khan held the MQM responsible for the attacks in Karachi. National Party senator and senior vice president Hasil Bizenjo underscored the need for an inquiry into the incidents. An editorial in the Daily Times said, \\"the possibility of any compromise to correct [Musharraf's] original mistake [of removing the chief justice] has vanished now ... the ante has been upped by the government.\\" =Killing of Syed Hammad Raza= At around on 13 May 2007, Supreme Court additional registrar Syed Hammad Raza was shot dead near his home in Islamabad. Raza was a close associate of Chaudhry and a vital witness in the case against Chaudhry's suspension. After leaving Karachi, the chief justice visited Raza's widow Shabana the same night to present his condolences. Reuters reported Shabana telling Chaudhry, \\"You called him to Islamabad. You should have protected him, and now my children need protection as well.\\" According to Chaudhry's lawyer Tariq Mehmood, Raza was a prime witness in the case as he had witnessed the removal of files from the chief justice's chambers on the day of his suspension. He said that \\"[Raza] was under pressure.\\" =Nationwide protests= On 13 May 2007, opposition parties observed a \\"black day\\" and called for a general strike in Punjab on 14 May 2007. The leaders of PPP, PML-N, MMA, PTI, ANP, PMAP, and the Khaksar Tehrik called for action against the miscreants that spread violence on 12 May calling them \\"killers\\".PMAP slams MQM, govt for carnage. Dawn. The Punjab leadership of the MMA held the Sindh government responsible for the loss of lives. The 14 May strikes in Lahore paralysed the city as opposition activists protested against the government response to the riots. 8,000 people, including lawyers and human rights activists, chanted \\"Out with Musharraf!\\" and \\"Death to Altaf Hussain!\\" In addition, protestors burned effigies of Musharraf and hundreds forced their way through a police barricade. Authorities responded by banning demonstrations and declaring a national holiday. Shops were closed and public transportation was shut down in the country's major cities. It is the largest strike in Pakistan since Musharraf assumed his presidency in 1999, with much of the unrest stemming from news reports that government troops were in Karachi, =Arrest of Rana Saleemullah Khan= At a press conference on 14 May 2007, Sindh chief minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim assured that the situation in Karachi was under control and that there had been no serious incidents of violence in the days following the initial 12 May riots, despite fears to the contrary. The chief minister also indicated that opposition parties had not sought permission from the provincial government to hold their rallies on 12 May 2007. He also said the general elections would be held as scheduled in a few months and accused the opposition of showing impatience in that regard. Rahim also revealed that the police had arrested former DIG Rana Saleemullah Khan on court orders. Khan had been a vocal advocate of the chief justice and was Chaudhry's witness with regards to the Mannu Bheel case. He was one of the two witnesses in that case, alongside the recently killed Syed Hammad Raza. Khan feared that his arrest was a fa√ßade and a sham, and that he could become another victim of extrajudicial killing. There had been several reports that Khan was humiliated after his arrest. =Abduction of Iqbal Kazmi= On 3 June 2007, the government announced that it would impose a ban on any televised live talk show that discusses the issue of the chief justice's suspension. It threatened to take punitive action against broadcasters that displayed an anti-state or anti-national stance and cast \\"aspersions on the integrity of the armed forces\\". Under Musharraf's decree, the government amended the PEMRA Ordinance to impose these new restrictions on private television channels on 4 June 2007. Opposition parties and lawyers campaigned against these amendments and observed a \\"black day\\" in solidarity with the broadcasters and journalists. Amongst the petitioners was the civil rights activist Syed Mohammad Iqbal Kazmi who had recently filed a petition in the Sindh High Court on 12 May violence. Kazmi was abducted by unidentified persons on 6 June 2007 after he had filed his petition against the PEMRA ordinance. He was later released by his abductors on the condition that he would leave Karachi along with his family. However upon his release, Kazmi revealed that the reason for his abduction was rather his petition on the 12 May violence. He told of his harrowing ordeal where he was quizzed about his association with Imran Khan's PTI and the reasons as to why he named MQM founder and chief Altaf Hussain in his petition. His petition had also included the names of several other major political and government figures as respondents alongside Hussain. The named respondents included Sindh chief minister Arbab Ghulam Rahim, federal interior secretary Syed Kamal Shah, adviser to Sindh CM on home affairs Waseem Akhtar, chief secretary Shakeel Durrani, home secretary Ghulam M. Muhtaram Naqvi, provincial police officer Niaz A. Siddiqui, CCPO Azhar A. Farooqui, and the SHOs of City Courts and Jamshed Quarters police stations. Formal inquisition Alongside Kazmi's petition, the Sindh High Court initiated its own suo moto proceedings issuing contempt of court notices to the federal interior secretary, Sindh chief secretary and home secretary, AIGP (acting PPO), Town Police Officer and other officials who were responsible for maintaining law and order on 12 May 2007. Subsequently, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also moved an identical contempt of court application. A seven-member bench was constituted to preside over the case. The bench included justices Sarmad Jalal Osmany, Anwar Zaheer Jamali, Mushir Alam, Azizullah M. Memon, Khilji Arif Hussain, Maqbool Baqar and Ali Sain Dino Metlo, who were authorised to probe into the several issues that resulted in the 12 May bloodshed. No main culprit in this case was ever arrested. MQM Altaf Hussian is enjoying his life in United Kingdom, former President General (retired) Musharraf is spending his time in Dubai, Europe and United States, Chief Minister Sindh Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim went to Dubai in 2008 and came back Karachi in 2013, Governor Sindh Ishratul Ibad Khan ruled the province as Governor till 2016 and now traveling in and out of country while the then Adviser to the Sindh Chief Minister on Home Affairs Waseem Akhtar is now ruling Karachi as its Mayor.

The English translation by Laurie Thompson was published in September, 2007. With some elements similar to those of John le Carr√©'s The Constant Gardner, Mankell's novel addresses the African HIV/AIDS epidemic, the pharmaceutical industry, and greed centered on the African epidemic. The protagonist is Louise Cantor, a Swedish archaeologist who on returning home from an excavation in Greece makes a tragic discovery. Louise embarks on a search for answers to explain why the tragedy has occurred. Her journey takes her to Australia, to Spain and to Mozambique. Critical reception Reviewing Kennedy's Brain in The Independent, Paul Binding found that Henrik Cantor, \\"an idealistic young Swede\\" whose death, and its subsequent investigation by his mother Louise provides the narrative drive of the book, \\"has acknowledged that there exist those who, deliberately and using all their intelligence and money, seek to profit from the distress of others. Theirs is a wickedness hard rationally to comprehend, yet so linked to power and the bastions of the establishment that it is also hard to fight, let alone defeat. In this double predicament lie the strengths and the weaknesses of the novel\\". Binding added, \\"It presents Louise's wide-ranging, perilous investigation with button-holing intensity, unmatched even by this master of suspense. But the evil she meets is too vast, too ungraspable through the conventions of the thriller, for its representatives, despite their vividness, ever to transcend the dark \\"silhouettes\\" of Henrik's original perception. This is as true of victims as of villains. In contrast, Louise herself, her father, Artur, up north in Mankell's beloved forests of H√§rjedalen, and her hopeless but touching husband, Aron, are living beings about whom we can imaginatively care.\\" Writing in The Daily Telegraph, John Preston was less impressed saying, \\"It's getting harder and harder to know what to expect from Henning Mankell. For 10 years he produced a series of densely plotted, richly imaginative thrillers featuring his Swedish detective, Kurt Wallender. These were followed by a novel featuring Wallender's daughter, Linda, who followed her father into the police force. Sadly, though, both Wallenders seem to have been put permanently out to grass. Then last year came the gloomily symbolic non-thriller, Depths, which would have tried the patience of his most devoted admirers, and now here is perhaps his strangest book yet. It's a thriller, of sorts anyway, but one which offers little explanation of what's going on, and even less in the way of resolution\\". Preston added, \\"It would be giving too much away to reveal more, but suffice it to say that Kennedy's Brain bears certain thematic resemblances to John le Carr√©'s The Constant Gardener. This, though, is the least of its problems. The main difficulty is that the indignation with which it is suffused ‚Äì a note in the epilogue refers to how anger was Mankell's driving force when he was writing it ‚Äì seems to have played havoc with his normally sure-footed exposition\\". He found the plot to be, \\"a succession of coincidences and fortuitous revelations which never gels, or develops any tension\\", before concluding that, \\"As usual with Mankell there are some great lines ‚Äì 'Sorrow is like mice, it always finds a way in,' he notes at one point. All told, though, this is a disappointingly muddled affair\\".

History Gehenna were formed in January 1993 by original members Sanrabb, Dolgar, and Sir Vereda.Biography , accessed on 17 January 2013. After their first demo, entitled Black Seared Heart, Sir Vereda left the band due to legal problems, and was replaced by Dirge Rep. The band also enlisted Svartalv as bass player during this time. In 1994 Necromantic Gallery Productions released Gehenna's first 7\\" EP Ancestor of the Darkly Sky, and the band signed and cancelled a deal with No Fashion Records; they entered a studio to record a full-length album in January 1994, but it was \\"cancelled due to NFR's lack of money\\". Three uncompleted songs from this studio session appear on the re-release of the Black Seared Heart demo via Holycaust Records. They played at \\"the legendary Zonen concert, wich [sic!] led to the appearance on the now 'cult' norwegian Black Metal documentary 'Det Svarte Alvor'\\". Gehenna were joined by Sarcana in 1994 and played at a festival held at Lusa Lottes Metal Pub, Oslo, with Dark Funeral, Gorgoroth, Dissection and Enslaved. They signed with both Head Not Found and Cacophonous Records; the former released their First Spell EP, the latter released Gehenna's first full-length, Seen Through the Veils of Darkness, in 1995. This record featured a guest appearance by Garm of Arcturus and Ulver doing vocals on the track Vinterriket. In 1996, Gehenna released their second full-length album, Malice, and Svartalv left the band. Noctifer replaced him but left to be replaced by E.N.Death. The band performed at the Under the Black Sun festival and toured Europe with Marduk and Mysticum. In 1997, Sarcana and Dirge Rep both left the band and were replaced by Damien and Blod. Gehenna signed with Moonfog Productions, who released the EP Deadlights and the album Adimiron Black (featuring Sarcana on the title track and \\"Eater of the Dead\\") in 1998. Damien left the band in 1998. They performed with D√∏dheimsgard and Gorgoroth in Oslo. In 2000, Gehenna released Murder and played in Mexico City. E.N.Death left the band, Nekro joined and left them, Amok and Kine joined Gehenna, and Blod left and was replaced by S.Winter. The band planned to record their next album in July 2002, but the actual recordings took place in 2004, after Dolgar's return to Gehenna.News , accessed on 14 January 2013. The album, titled WW, was released in 2005, featuring a guest appearance by Frost. Gehenna performed at By:larm Stavanger, Zone Trondheim, Inferno Metal Festival and Codevilla, Thunder Road (Milano). S.Winter and Kine left the band. In 2006 Gehenna signed with ANP Records. Dirge Rep returned as a live session member, and Martin joined as a live session member. They performed with Thundra at Tribute, Sandnes. In 2007, the previous contract signed with ANP Records was cancelled, and Dirge Rep became a full-time member again. The band performed with Mayhem at Folken, Stavanger and planned a new album. In 2008, Gehenna announced that they had signed with Norwegian-based Indie Recordings. In 2009 Skinnd√∏d replaced Amok as guitarist in Gehenna. In 2012 Dirge Rep left the band again after their show at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany and was immediately replaced by Slaktaren. In 2013, five years after signing to Indie Recordings, Gehenna finally recorded and released a new album called Unravel. This was Skinnd√∏d and Slaktaren's first recordings for Gehenna and the band's first album to feature Sanrabb as the only lead vocalist. Dolgar left after the album was finished and was replaced by Byting, with Sanrabb taking all further vocal duties.  Musical style  Jackie Smit of Chronicles of Chaos called Gehenna's second album, Malice, \\"a sterling example of symphonic black metal\\". According to Sanrabb, the album was \\"more influenced by the music we listen to ourselves, which basically is classical music and straight-forward heavy metal\\".Sanrabb & Terrorizer , accessed on 17 January 2013. Gehenna broke with symphonic black metal after that album. According to Smit, Murder was \\"a misguided attempt at a death metal record\\", which disappointed many fans of the band's earlier style. The vocals on that album were closer to shoutings typical for thrash metal than to the high screams typical for Norwegian black metal. In 2002, the band announced that the following album would be \\"a bit more melodic and keyboard-based than the last two\\", and that \\"people who liked the first three albums will be into the new material\\". Yet WW was \\"not so much a black metal phoenix rising from the ashes, but a band completely redefining their philosophy toward songwriting [‚Ä¶], choosing [‚Ä¶] to throw its lot in with the grim sounds of Darkthrone and Burzum. Indeed the record's harsh, raw guitar tone is very similar to the one that gave _Hvis Lyset Tar Oss_ such a maleficent feel, while Dolgar's vocals drip with an unnerving and coarse hatred as the band hammer out their themes of war and destruction at a frenetic pace.\\"  Lyrics and ideology  Gehenna are mostly \\"about music. This means that the actual lyrics are something we add. Of course, we start out with the music, so it's basically for the music.\\" Many of the lyrics and philosophies are based on Sanrabb's personal Satanic beliefs, \\"but this does not affect all the lyrics. We wouldn't really fit into the label black metal. Well, we could, but we choose not to label ourselves, which is a new thing to be into nowadays, but anyway... The thing is, it's not purely based on Satanic beliefs or politics or whatever. Because we don't want to deal in propaganda for this or that. [‚Ä¶] It's about music, it is - as I said - a medium for our thoughts and feelings. It is also ever-changing. I think that we haven't really put ourselves in a spot where we can't get out if we want to, so to speak. [‚Ä¶] My view, when it comes to Satan, is not that he is a 'nice guy'. I do believe in a personified Satan, but not in physical form. But the thing is, if you summon something that is totally and utterly 100% evil, which Satan is supposed to be, absolutely no good will come of it. A lot of people into Satanism have a tendency to say that Satan will serve them, Satan will do this, Satan will do that... Satan will do nothing! Satan hates everything, Satan hates every human being. It's just about being a part of this power. It's nothing that you become, it's something you are, I think, which is my personal belief. To quote Euronymous, 'We are but slaves to the one with horns'. Some people will probably say 'That's pretty silly, because there's no use worshipping someone who hates you', But it's not necessarily about worship. Either way, you don't have to like it, but you are who you are. It's just something that comes very naturally to me. I don't think Satan's a nice guy, though.\\" The lyrics on WW are about war.

She was the first pre-dreadnought built for the German Navy; earlier, the navy had only built coastal defense ships and armored frigates. The ship was laid down at the AG Vulcan dockyard in 1890, launched on 21 September 1891, and commissioned into the German Navy on 19 November 1893. Brandenburg and her three sisters were unique for their time in that they carried six heavy guns instead of the four that were standard in other navies. She was named after the Province of Brandenburg. Brandenburg served with I Division during the first decade of her service with the fleet. This period was generally limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a barracks ship. Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig, after the war, in 1920.  Design  alt=Line drawing for this type of ship; the vessel had three large gun turrets on the centerline and two thin smoke stacks. Brandenburg was the first pre- dreadnought battleship of the (Imperial Navy). Prior to the ascension of Kaiser Wilhelm II to the German throne in June 1888, the German fleet had been largely oriented toward defense of the German coastline and Leo von Caprivi, chief of the (Imperial Naval Office), had ordered a number of coastal defense ships in the 1880s. In August 1888, the Kaiser, who had a strong interest in naval matters, replaced Caprivi with (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Alexander von Monts and instructed him to include four battleships in the 1889‚Äì1890 naval budget. Monts, who favored a fleet of battleships over the coastal defense strategy emphasized by his predecessor, cancelled the last four coastal defense ships authorized under Caprivi and instead ordered four battleships. Though they were the first modern battleships built in Germany, presaging the Tirpitz-era High Seas Fleet, the authorization for the ships came as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion of the 1880s caused by the (Young School). Brandenburg and her sister ships‚Äî, , and ‚Äîwere long, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. She was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines that each drove a screw propeller. Steam was provided by twelve transverse cylindrical Scotch marine boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . She had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men. The ship was unusual for its time in that it possessed a broadside of six heavy guns in three twin gun turrets, rather than the four- gun main battery typical of contemporary battleships. The forward and after turrets carried 28 cm (11 in) K L/40 guns, while the amidships turret mounted a pair of 28 cm (11 in) guns with shorter L/35 barrels. Her secondary armament consisted of eight SK L/35 quick-firing guns mounted in casemates and eight 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns, also casemate mounted. Brandenburgs armament system was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Although the main battery was heavier than other capital ships of the period, the secondary armament was considered weak in comparison to other battleships. The ship was protected with compound armor. Her main belt armor was thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was thick. The main battery barbettes were protected with thick armor.  Service history  =Construction to 1896= Illustration of Brandenburg by William Frederick Mitchell, c. 1894 Ordered as battleship A, Brandenburg was laid down at AG Vulcan in Stettin in May 1890. Her hull was completed by September 1891 and launched on 21 September, when she was christened by Wilhelm II. Fitting out work followed and was finished, with the exception of the installation of her guns, by the end of September 1893, when she was transferred to Kiel. There, her guns were mounted, and on 19 November Brandenburg was commissioned into the fleet. Sea trials began four days later; on the first day of trials, Wilhelm II and a delegation from the Brandenburg provincial government came aboard the ship to observe. On 27 December, the ship received a flag bearing the coat of arms of Brandenburg, which was flown on special occasions. At the end of the month, Brandenburg was formally assigned to II Division of the Maneuver Squadron. Trials continued into 1894, and while conducting forced draft tests in Strander Bucht on 16 February, the ship suffered the worst machinery accident in the history of the . One of the main steam valves from the starboard boilers exploded, killing forty-four men in the boiler room and injuring another seven. The cause of the explosion was a defect in the construction of the valve. Prince Henry, aboard the nearby transport ship Pelikan, immediately ordered the ship to come to Brandenburgs aid, and took off the dead and wounded men. Brandenburg then put into Wiker Bucht, and was later towed to Kiel, where she entered the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. The accident caused a minor political incident after the press criticized Wilhelm II for failing to send Prince Henry to the funerals for the sailors. Additionally, VAdm Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the (Imperial Naval Office) stated before the (Imperial Diet) that \\"such accidents could occur again and again\\", which increased parliamentary resistance to further increases in naval budgets; this led to an initial rejection of funds for the first armored cruiser, . Admirals Eduard von Knorr and Hans von Koester criticized the comment, forcing Hollmann to publicly apologize. alt=Germany is bordered in the northwest by the North Sea, across which is Great Britain, and in the northeast by the Baltic Sea and its rival Russia Repair work was completed by 16 April, allowing Brandenburg to return to trials which lasted until the middle of August, and included a cruise through the Kattegat. On 21 August, the ship joined II Division, though a reorganization of the fleet saw the ship transferred to I Division, along with her three sister ships. I Division was based in Wilhelmshaven in the North Sea. Brandenburg and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at Kiel on 3 December. The squadron thereafter began a winter training cruise in the Baltic Sea; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet. In previous years, the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months. During this voyage, I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. King Oscar II held a reception for the visiting German delegation. Thereafter, further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs. The year 1895 began with what became the normal training cruises to Heligoland and then to Bremerhaven, with Wilhelm II onboard the flagship, Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm. This was followed by individual ship and divisional training, which was interrupted by a voyage to the northern North Sea, the first time that units of the main German fleet had left home waters. On this trip, Brandenburg joined Kurf√ºrst Friedrich Wilhelm and the two battleships stopped in Lerwick in Shetland from 16 to 23 March. These exercises tested the ships in heavy weather; both vessels performed admirably. In May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic, and they were concluded by a visit of the fleet to Kirkwall in Orkney. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in Kiel Bay in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony. Further training exercises lasted until 1 July, when I Division began a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. This operation had political motives; Germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels‚Äîthe protected cruiser , the coastal defense ship , and the sailing frigate ‚Äîto an international naval demonstration off the Moroccan coast at the same time. The main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to Spanish waters. Rough weather again allowed Brandenburg and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent seakeeping. The fleet departed Vigo and stopped in Queenstown, Ireland. Wilhelm II, aboard his yacht Hohenzollern, attended the Cowes Regatta while the rest of the fleet stayed off the Isle of Wight. Illustration of Brandenburg On 10 August, the fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers later that month. The first exercises began in the Heligoland Bight on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the torpedo boat capsized and sank in the storms‚Äîonly three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming exercises, including live-fire exercises, in the Kattegat and the Great Belt. During this period, on 22 August, Brandenburg collided with the aviso , though only the latter was damaged in the accident. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. The next day, while she was in Kiel, Czar Nicholas II of Russia inspected Brandenburg during a visit to Germany. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of Pomerania and in Danzig Bay. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off Jersh√∂ft concluded the maneuvers on 14 September. The rest of the year was spent on individual ship training. The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted through April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May, which included a visit to the Dutch ports of Vlissingen and Nieuwediep. Further maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters where the ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel. On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training. =1897‚Äì1900= Brandenburg and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897. Early in the year, the naval command considered deploying I Division to another naval demonstration off Morocco to protest the murder of two German nationals there, but a smaller squadron of sailing frigates was sent instead. The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and (Empress) Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court; both divisions of I Squadron were sent to Kronstadt to accompany the Kaiser, who proceeded to the capital at Saint Petersburg. They had returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the , (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, and the new commander of I Squadron, VAdm August von Thomsen. These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery, especially at longer ranges, though the necessities of the line-ahead formation led to a great deal of rigidity in the tactics. Thomsen's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. alt=An illustration of a large warship steaming at high speed and creating a large bow wave In early December, I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men. Additionally, while steaming through the Great Belt, Brandenburg collided with the ironclad , damaging both vessels and forcing them to put into Kiel for repairs. After temporary repairs to Brandenburg were completed, she moved to Wilhelmshaven, where a new ram bow had to be installed. The fleet followed the typical routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident, though a voyage to the British Isles was also included and the fleet stopped in Queenstown, Greenock, and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises: the maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of Mecklenburg and a pitched battle with an \\"Eastern Fleet\\" in the Danzig Bay. While steaming back to Kiel, a severe storm hit the fleet, causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued the maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. In December, I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in Eckernf√∂rde Bay, followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited Kungsbacka, Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of I Division went into dock for their winter repairs. During a snowstorm on 22 March 1899, the anchor chain for the ironclad broke, allowing the ship to drift out and run aground in Strander Bucht. Brandenburg and the shipyard steamer towed Oldenburg free and back to port. On 5 April, the ship participated in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Eckernf√∂rde during the First Schleswig War. In May, I and II Divisions, along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic, went on a major cruise into the Atlantic. On the voyage out, I Division stopped in Dover and II Division went into Falmouth to restock their coal supplies. I Division joined II Division at Falmouth on 8 May, and the two units then departed for the Bay of Biscay, arriving at Lisbon on 12 May. There, they met the British Channel Fleet of eight battleships and four armored cruisers. The German fleet departed for Germany, stopping again in Dover on 24 May. There, they participated in the naval review celebrating Queen Victoria's 80th birthday. The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May. In July, the fleet conducted squadron maneuvers in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with soldiers from the X Corps. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers. The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the German Bight, which lasted until 7 September. After a third phase of the maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September, the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In the second half of March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in Shetland from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, the ships of I Division were reassigned to II Division. = Boxer Rebellion = During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in Peking and murdered Baron Clemens von Ketteler, the German plenipotentiary. The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan. Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers. At the time, the primary German military force in China was the East Asia Squadron, which consisted of the protected cruisers Kaiserin Augusta, , and , the small cruisers and , and the gunboats and . There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men. Led by the British Admiral Edward Seymour, these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in Tientsin due to heavy resistance. As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition included Brandenburg and her three sisters, six cruisers, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of (General Field Marshal) Alfred von Waldersee. German 1912 map of the upright=1.4 On 7 July, KAdm Richard von Gei√üler, the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the Jade Bight, bound for China. They stopped to coal at Gibraltar on 17‚Äì18 July and passed through the Suez Canal on 26‚Äì27 July. More coal was taken on at Perim in the Red Sea, and on 2 August the fleet entered the Indian Ocean. On 10 August, the ships reached Colombo, Ceylon, and on 14 August they passed through the Strait of Malacca. They arrived in Singapore on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching Hong Kong on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer roadstead at Wusong, downriver from Shanghai. By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Nevertheless, Brandenburg took up patrol duties in the area surrounding the mouth of the Yangtze River, and in October participated in the occupations of the coastal fortifications protecting the cities of Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao before returning to the Yangtze. Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Brandenburg went to Hong Kong for her overhaul in January and February 1901. After the work was completed, she steamed to Tsingtao in the German Kiautschou Bay concession, where she took part in training exercises with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet to stop in Mah√©, Seychelles, to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said. On 1 August they reached Cadiz, and then met with I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral Koester, who was now the Inspector General of the Navy. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved. In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks. = 1901‚Äì1914 = alt=A large warship moored to a buoy, with a group of sailors crowded together on the bow Upon their return, Brandenburg and her sisters were assigned to I Squadron. On 21 August, the annual fleet maneuvers began; these were interrupted on 11 September when Nicholas II visited the fleet while on another visit to Germany. The ships conducted a naval review for his visit in the Putziger Wiek. For the remainder of the maneuvers, the navy cooperated with the German Army in joint exercises in West Prussia that included the ships' (marines), and I Corps and XVII Corps. Later in the year, Brandenburg took part in a winter cruise, followed by a period in the shipyard in Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance. The year 1902 followed the routine pattern of individual, unit, and fleet training, along with a major cruise to Norway and Scotland, which concluded by passing through the English Channel. After completing the fleet maneuvers in August and September, Brandenburg was decommissioned on 23 October. The ship's crew were sent to man the newly commissioned battleship , which took her place in I Squadron. In the early 1900s, the four Brandenburgs were taken into the drydocks at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven for major reconstruction. Brandenburg was modernized between 1903 and 1904. During the modernization, a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure, along with a gangway. Brandenburg and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had the hamper amidships reduced. She was recommissioned on 4 April 1905 and was assigned to II Squadron of what was now renamed the Active Battlefleet, though she remained in service only briefly. She participated in the normal routine of training exercises through 1905, 1906, and 1907, before being decommissioned again on 30 September 1907. During this period, the only noteworthy incident involving Brandenburg was a minor grounding outside Stockholm that did not inflict any damage on the ship. Upon her second decommissioning, her crew was again sent to staff a new battleship, this time . Brandenburg was thereafter assigned to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. By 1910, the first dreadnought battleships began to enter service with the German fleet, rendering older vessels like Brandenburg obsolescent. That year, she temporarily returned to service with III Squadron to take part in the annual fleet maneuvers. After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. Brandenburg again temporarily returned to III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the (Baltic Sea Naval Station), where she remained inactive for the following two years. = World War I and subsequent activity = Illustration of a Brandenburg-class battleship with torpedo boats in the foreground At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Brandenburg was reactivated and assigned to V Squadron, which was initially tasked with coastal defense duties in the North Sea. In mid-September, V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Henry. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. Brandenburg and the rest of the squadron returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic. Prince Henry next ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of the V Squadron ships. Brandenburg had her crew reduced in Kiel, and she was briefly assigned to the reserve division in the Baltic. From July to December, she underwent shipyard maintenance, before being transferred to Libau. On 20 December, she was decommissioned there, for use as a water distillation and barracks ship. Her heavy guns were removed for use in the Ottoman Empire, but there is no record of them ever having been shipped to the Ottomans. Near the end of the war, Brandenburg was taken back to Danzig, where work began to convert her into a target ship, but the war ended before the reconstruction was completed. Brandenburg was struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping. The ship was purchased by , a shipbreaking firm headquartered in Berlin, and she was then broken up for scrap in Danzig.

Construction history Gladiator was originally built as BAM-6, and was launched 7 May 1943 as AM-319 by the General Engineering & Drydock Co., Alameda, California; sponsored by Mrs. Madeline A. Silva; and acquired and simultaneously commissioned 25 February 1944, Lt. Comdr. Robert W. Costello in command.  World War II service  Gladiator sailed from San Francisco, California, 1 May 1944 with a convoy for Pearl Harbor and subsequently made four round trip escort voyages from Hawaii‚Äîone to Kwajalein and three to Eniwetok‚Äîfrom 22 May-11 September 1944. Underway again 16 October, she reached Ulithi 12 November and commenced patrol and escort duty in those waters. Voyages to Eniwetok, Kossol Roads, and Saipan, were frequently made to shepherd merchantmen to and from those strategic ports until Gladiator sailed from Ulithi 19 March 1945 for combat at Okinawa. Closing the beaches of Okinawa 24 March when Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee‚Äô s battleships were bombarding the island, Gladiator began minesweeping operations and screening duties. = Under attack by Japanese aircraft = On 6 April she came under attack from a Japanese bomber and shot it down with the help of four American fighters that were on the bomber's tail during its approach. Another plane was splashed 6 days later when Gladiator's automatic weapons brought it down close aboard on the starboard beam; debris rained about the ship. A third enemy plane was shot down 22 April, crashing into the sea after passing just fifty feet above the ship's deck; but one man was killed and five wounded by the plane's strafing. Gladiator continued minesweeping duties off Okinawa until sailing 19 May with a convoy for Saipan and Guam, subsequently returning to Okinawa 21 June. From 8‚Äì25 July 1945 she conducted minesweeping operations in the East China Sea, destroying six mines, and put in at Guam 11 August for major overhaul. = End-of-war operations = Gladiator departed Guam 24 November and reached San Francisco, California, 15 December 1945. She steamed to San Pedro, California, 30 May 1946, and, after being towed to San Diego, California, 2 October 1946 she was decommissioned at that port 2 days later.  Korean War service  Recommissioned 29 February 1952 at Long Beach, California, Gladiator sailed 2 September for Japan, closing Sasebo 1 month later, and steaming to Wonsan, Korea, 27 October. She swept mines in those dangerous waters until returning to Sasebo 10 November and subsequently, until the spring of 1953, divided her time between mine- sweeping operations at Wonsan, Inchon, and Hungnam and replenishment and training exercises in Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan.  Post-Korean War activity  Gladiator departed Sasebo, Japan, 19 March 1953 and put in at Long Beach, California, 10 April. She engaged in peacetime activities: overhaul at San Francisco, training exercises off southern California, a round trip cruise from Long Beach to Acapulco, Mexico, and Balboa, Panama (15 January-12 February 1954), and a cruise to Bellingham, Washington, and return (28 June-10 July 1954).  Decommissioning and disposal  Gladiator was decommissioned at Long Beach, California, on 15 March 1955. Redesignated MSF-319, Gladiator entered the reserve fleet berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida. She was later transferred to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She remained in \\"mothballs\\" until 1973, when she was sold to Mexico and renamed Santos Delgollado.  Battle honors  Gladiator received two battle stars for World War II service.  Mexican Navy service  The former Gladiator was sold in 1973 to the Mexican Navy, which renamed her ARM Santos Delgollado (C75). Her pennant number was later changed to G07, before it was changed a final time to P106 in 1993. , Santos Delgollado was in active service with the Mexican Navy.

History  After the release of the final The God Machine album in 1995, Proper-Sheppard set up the Flower Shop label, putting out records from the likes of Elevate, Ligament, and Swervedriver. He also began recording a year later as Sophia. Sophia sounded nothing like The God Machine. Instead of ear-busting and grating, they were low key and introspective. With the help from other Flower Shop artists ‚Äì Graham Miles (Elevate), Dan Mulligan (Oil Seed Rape) and James Elkington (Elevate) ‚Äì he recorded 1996's Fixed Water featuring the single \\"Are You Happy Now\\". Two years later, 'The Infinite Circle' followed. In 2005 this album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. In 2001 Sophia released a live album 'De Nachten'. The album was recorded during two festival appearances in Belgium and the Netherlands and features four new songs and a cover of the John Lennon song Jealous Guy. In January 2004 Sophia released their third studio album 'People Are Like Seasons'. The album was released by City Slang/EMI and marks the first Sophia release for a major label. Thanks to the massive airplay for its first single 'Oh my love' the band reached a whole new audience. This resulted in chart success for the album in several European countries (highest entry was no. 8 in Belgium). The band ‚Äì of which the main members are now Robin Proper- Sheppard (vocals, guitar), Jeff Townsin (drums), Will Foster (keyboards) and ex-Swervedriver mainman Adam Franklin (guitar) ‚Äì did a very successful tour of Europe in the first half of 2004. In the Fall of 2004, a rarities cd was released called 'Collections:One'. Most of 2005 and 2006 were spent writing and recording new songs for the fourth studio album 'Technology Won't Save Us', which was released in October 2006. In the Spring of 2009, the album 'There Are No Goodbyes' was released. The limited edition version featured a bonus disc of an acoustic gig (Robin solo with a string-quartet), recorded at Valentine's Day 2009 in Vienna. During 2010 Proper-Sheppard did an extensive solo acoustic tour called 'At Home With Sophia...'. The idea was to create an atmosphere that was as intimate as a living room, for people to come and hear the songs of Sophia much as they were originally written. All shows were recorded and a number of them are available for free download on the Sophia Bandcamp page. In the Spring of 2016, the album 'As We Make Our Way (Unknown Harbours)' was released. In the fall of 2017, the album 'As We Make Our Way ‚Äì The Live Recordings' was released. It was recorded during the tour that supported the ' As We Make Our Way (Unknown Harbours) ' album. That album was played non-stop from start to finish and then a vast selection of classics by (what many call) Sophia v2.0. Some of these songs have changed rather dramatically from the studio versions. In September 2020, Sophia released the album 'Holding On / Letting Go', following the release of 3 singles from the album, earlier in the year.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zrenjanin that covers the territory of Serbian Banat. The Cathedral is located in the Zrenjanin's main square, Trg slobode (Freedom Square). It is dedicated to Saint John of Nepomuk.  History  For the duration of the Ottoman rule (1552‚Äì1718) there stood a mosque, but was razed down by the Austrians following Turkish withdrawal from the city and Banat. However, this is not the first cathedral built following the removal of the mosque. Prior to the cathedral seen today, a Baroque-style church, built in 1768, stood in its place. Over the next century, the building deteriorated badly and the authorities decided to build a new one. The construction of the present-day cathedral commenced in 1864 by the project of Franz Xaver Brandeisz, who also built several churches in Banat, and lasted four years.  Features  The Zrenjanin Cathedral was built in the Neoclassical style. The interior was decorated by Josef Goigner from Tyrol and the cathedral features a pipe organ made in Timi»ôoara, in 1907. Windows are decorated with stained glass. Due to the cathedral's size, the steeple can be seen from most parts of the city.

Commonly regarded as the greatest of all Georgian theater directors,Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History: 2nd edition, pp. 213-4. Routledge, . he directed, from 1926 to 1935, the Rustaveli Theater in Tbilisi, Georgia, and transformed it into one of the most successful troupes in the Soviet Union. During Joseph Stalin‚Äôs Great Purge, he was arrested on trumped-up charges of espionage and executed.  Early career  Sandro Akhmeteli was born to the family of a priest in the mountainous village in the province of Kakheti (eastern Georgia, then part of Imperial Russia), whose landscapes and culture heavily influenced the future director‚Äôs aesthetic values. Taught at a grammar school by the writer Vasil Barnovi, Akhmeteli acquired a profound knowledge of Georgian and world literature. He was a perfect boxer at the same time. An unfortunate marriage forced him to leave for St. Petersburg where he enrolled into St. Petersburg University to study law (until 1916). However, Akhmeteli spent most of his time in writing theater criticism. In 1915, he produced his first manifesto, condemning the Georgian theater as one that had \\"to be destroyed, to be made softer, more temperamental, more fiery, emotional, stentorian, bold, heroic.\\" In 1918, Georgia became independent from Russia, and the new government launched a program aimed at reviving the national theater. Akhemeteli returned to Georgia to lead the younger actors into a coup against the establishment. In 1922, the conspicuous Russia-based Georgian theater director Kote Marjanishvili also returned to Georgia, and the two men began reforming the Tbilisi Rustaveli Theater. Their collaboration was productive, yet uneasy. Restricted and somewhat conformist Marjanishvili found Akhmeteli‚Äôs autocratic rule and turbulent character too violent and left the Rustaveli Theater in 1926, leaving Akhemeteli in sole control of the company. Akhmeteli formed his own artistic corporation Duruji (after a river in his native Kakheti) and required all its members to sign a special pledge to \\"sacrifice their life and future to the will of the corporation and theater\\".  Triumph and fall  Logo of the Rustaveli Theater under Akhmeteli's directorship Akhemetli's relations with the recently established Soviet government in Georgia were difficult. Although revolutionary and leftist, his experimentalism and expressionism did not particularly conform to the Bolshevist doctrines. During the anti-Soviet uprising in 1924, he was briefly arrested and questioned about his corporation which was deemed by the secret police to be a conspiracy. He had to disband Duruji under Lavrentiy Beria‚Äôs pressure in 1927, but Akhemetli‚Äôs resonant successes earned him protection in Moscow. His skills at spectacular massed casts, and choreography garnered an international acclaim. After his masterpiece, Lamara, a play be Grigol Robakidze, won a prize at the 1930 Moscow Drama Olympiad, Akhemetli and his troupe were invited to tour the United States, alarming the Soviet authorities. Following Robakidze‚Äôs scandalous defection to Germany later that year, Beria launched a new assault against Akhmeteli. Paradoxically, Lamara continued to be staged to prove the achievements of Soviet theatrical art, although without the name of the playwright on the posters. Akhemeteli produced his last major work based on Die R√§uber by Schiller in 1933, followed by the triumphant tour to Moscow. Akhemeteli was never able to escape Beria's supervision. Accused of \\"anti- Soviet activities\\" and forbidden to tour abroad, Akhemeteli was finally removed from the scene in 1935. He took refuge among his admirers in Moscow, but, in 1937, he was extradited to Tbilisi to be imprisoned with a number of his colleagues on trumped-up charges of espionage for the British and plots to murder Beria and Joseph Stalin. Akhemeteli was subjected, in the presence of Beria, to extensive tortures until rendered mute and paralyzed. He was forced to make confessions but refused to name others and was executed on June 27, 1937. Foreign visitors to his theater were informed he had retired. Akhmeteli was first rehabilitated by the Georgian theater historian Natela Urushadze.Senelick, Laurence (2007), Historical Dictionary of Russian Theater, p. 8.

Couples living apart together (LAT) have an intimate relationship but live at separate addresses. It includes couples who wish to live together but are not yet able to, as well as couples who prefer (or must) live apart, for various reasons. In the early 2000s, LAT couples account for around 10% of adults in Britain (excluding those who live with family), and over a quarter of all those not married or cohabiting. Similar figures are recorded for other countries in northern Europe, including Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Research suggests similar or even higher rates in southern Europe, although here LAT couples often remain in parental households. In Australia, Canada and the US representative surveys indicate that between 6% and 9% of unmarried adults has a partner who lives elsewhere.Reimondos, A., Evans, A. and Gray, E. (2011) Living-apart-together (LAT) Relationships in Australia, Family Matters, Vol. 87: 43-55Milan, A., & Peters, A. (2003). Couples living apart. Canadian Social Trends, Summer, 2‚Äì6. LAT is also increasingly understood and accepted publicly, is seen by most as good enough for partnering, and subject to the same expectations about commitment and fidelity as marriage or cohabitation. Within Asia, \\"walking marriages\\" have been increasingly common in Beijing. Guo Jianmei, director of the center for women's studies at Beijing University, told a Newsday correspondent, \\"Walking marriages reflect sweeping changes in Chinese society.\\" A \\"walking marriage\\" refers to a type of temporary marriage formed by the Mosuo of China, in which male partners live elsewhere and make nightly visits. A similar arrangement in Saudi Arabia, called misyar marriage, also involves the husband and wife living separately but meeting regularly.  Research  Some researchers have seen living apart together as a historically new family form. From this perspective LAT couples can pursue both the intimacy of being in a couple and at the same time preserve autonomy. Some LAT couples may even de-prioritize couple relationships and place more importance on friendship. Alternatively, others see LAT as just a 'stage' on the way to possible cohabitation and marriage. In this view LATs are not radical pioneers moving beyond the family, rather they are cautious and conservative, and simply show a lack of commitment. In addition many may simply be modern versions of 'steady' or long term boy/girlfriends.Ermisch, J. & Siedler, T. (2009) Living Apart Together. IN Brynin, M. & Ermisch, J. (Eds.) Changing Relationships. New York and London, Routledge. Research using more comprehensive data suggests LAT couples are a heterogeneous social category with varying motivations for living apart. About a third see their relationship as too early for cohabitation, while others are prevented from living together, although they wish to do so, because of constraints like housing costs or (more rarely) job location. Many, however, prefer not to live together even though they have a long term relationship and could do so if they wanted. In practice motivations are often complex, for example one partner might wish to preserve the family home for existing children while the other might welcome autonomous time and space. Sometimes 'preference' can have a defensive motivation, for example the emotional desire to avoid the recurrence of a failed or unpleasant cohabiting relationship. Overall, LAT couples may be 'gladly apart; 'regretfully apart' or, for many, undecided and ambivalent where they experience both advantages and disadvantages.  Demographics  People living apart from their partner can be found in all age groups, although they are on average younger than cohabiting and married couples.Roseneil, S. (2006) On Not Living with a Partner: Unpicking Coupledom and Cohabitation. Sociological Research Online, 11 (3); Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2008) 'New families? Tradition and change in partnering and relationships' in British Social Attitudes 2007/8, London, NatCen, Sage In Britain almost 50% of LAT couples are in the youngest age group (18‚Äì24) although significant proportions are found in the 25‚Äì55 age group. Non-parents (those without current dependent children) are significantly more likely than parents to live apart from their partner. LAT couples are also found in all socio-economic groups, and in Britain show little difference to the class profile of the population as a whole.  In the life course  Living in LAT relationships means different things at different stages of the life course. Many LAT relationships among young adults and among adults with coresident, dependent children are temporary and involuntary. However, Living Apart Together in Later Life (LLAT) are generally a stable alternative to living with a partner. Among older persons, priorities shift as the responsibilities of raising children and paid work diminish and a limited future increases a preference for affectively rich relationships. LLAT is well suited to this process. The low level of organization of LLAT relationships and the absence of many of the commitments and ties that characterize marriage put the focus on the emotional side of the relationship. Gender also shapes the appeal of LLAT. Swedish research showed that older women were significantly more motivated to live apart together to secure independence and avoid a traditional gendered division of labor.  Attitudes  Living apart as a couple is increasingly understood and accepted. By 2006, in Britain, a majority (54 per cent) agreed that \\"a couple do not need to live together to have a strong relationship\\", with only 25 per cent disagreeing.Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2008) 'New families? Tradition and change in partnering and relationships' in British Social Attitudes 2007/8, London, NatCen, Sage By 2000 about one fifth of people aged 16‚Äì44 in Britain described 'living together apart' as their 'ideal relationship', compared to over 40 per cent for exclusive marriage and just under 20 per cent for unmarried cohabitation.Erens, B., McManus, S., Prescott, A., Field, J. with Johnson, A.M., Wellings, K., Fenton, K.A., Mercer, C., Macdowall, W., Copas, A.J. and Nanchahal, K., (2003), National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles II: Reference tables and summary report, London: NatCen/UCL/ LSHTM. Attitudinally, LATs couples themselves resemble cohabitants in a 'young partners' group, as opposed to a more conservative 'older married' majority.Duncan, S. and Phillips, M. (2010) 'People Who Live Apart Together (LATs) - How Different Are They?' The Sociological Review 58 (1): 112-134. Controlling for age LATs appear to be somewhat more liberal than other relationship categories for issues that directly affect them, for example about the effect of independence in relationships. However, for other controversial 'family' issues (like acceptance of same-sex partnership or of single motherhood) being a LAT in itself makes little difference, rather it is the relative traditionality of older married people that stands out compared to generally younger, and more liberal, unmarried cohabitants and LAT couples.  Examples of couples  Famous and celebrity couples have been cited from the 19th century to the 21st century. For example, a 2007 Times articleBennett, R. (2007) Couples that live apart . . . stay together, The Times, Sat 12 May 2007 names Woody Allen and Mia Farrow (then living either side of Central Park, New York City), Margaret Drabble and Michael Holroyd (married 36 years as of 2018, separate homes), Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton and their two children (two houses next door to each other in Hampstead, London), and Booker prizewinner Arundhati Roy and husband Pradip Krishen (with separate homes in Delhi, India). In the 1840s, the famous composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and the female novelist George Sand had an \\"unusual\\" relation that would be called LAT nowadays. The LAT relationship between philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905‚Äì1980) and the feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir (1908‚Äì1986) is often cited (although was exceptional in that Sartre apparently had other contemporaneous, if temporary, liaisons). It is important to remember, however, that it is not just the rich and famous who live apart together, LAT is common amongst ordinary people in all social groups. The documentary Two's a Crowd documents a New York City couple that was forced to give up a LAT relationship because of the economic downturn of the late 2000s. The film depicts how the couple tries to set up two separate \\"apartments\\" within one, after they are forced to move in with each other.

Designed to be portable and flexible, ports are currently available for x86-based and PowerPC-based PCs in native and hosted flavors, with other architectures in development. AROS, in a show of full circle, was also ported to the m68k-based Amiga 1200, and there is also an ARM port for the Raspberry Pi series.  Name and identity  AROS KittyAROS originally stood for Amiga Research Operating System, but to avoid any trademark issues with the Amiga name, it was changed to the recursive acronym AROS Research Operating System. The mascot of AROS is an anthropomorphic cat named Kitty, created by Eric Schwartz and officially adopted by the AROS Team in December 2, 2002. Used in the core AROS About and installer tools, it was also adopted by several AROS community sites and early distributions. Other AROS identifiable symbols and logos are based around the cat shape, such as the Icaros logo, which is a stylised cat's eye, or AFA (Aros for Amiga).  Current status  Amiga family/development tree. The project, started in 1995, has over the years become an almost \\"feature complete\\" implementation of AmigaOS with currently (as of May 2017) only a few lacking areas of functionality. This was achieved by the efforts of a small team of developers. It can currently be installed on most IBM PC compatibles, and features native graphics drivers for video cards such as the GeForce range made by Nvidia. As of May 2007 USB keyboards and mice are also supported. AROS has been ported to the Sam440ep PowerPC board and a first test version for the Efika was released in 2009. While the OS is still lacking in applications, a few have been ported, including E-UAE, an emulation program that allows 68k-native AmigaOS applications to run. Some AROS-specific applications have also been written. AROS has TCP/IP networking support, and has available an experimental version of AMosaic web browser, for test purposes, among other Internet-related applications. The Poseidon USB stack has been ported to AROS. AROS is designed to be source-compatible with AmigaOS. On 68000 Amiga Hardware it is also binary-compatible, so binaries already compiled for AmigaOS 3 can be run on AROS.Wikibooks:Aros/Platforms/68k support On x86 32-bit platforms Janus-UAE, an enhanced E-UAE, integrates Amiga emulation directly into AROS to run AmigaOS 68000 binaries nearly transparent to the user. Currently (as of August 2011) original AmigaOS 3 operating system files are required for the emulation. The aim of AROS is to remain aloof of the legal and political spats that have plagued other AmigaOS implementations by being independent both of hardware and of any central control. The de facto motto of AROS, \\"No schedule and rocking\\" both lampoons the infamous words \\"On Schedule and Rockin\\" from Amiga, Inc. CEO Bill McEwen, and declares a lack of the formal deadlines. A workable AmigaOS Kickstart clone for the Motorola 68000 processor was released on March 31, 2011 as part of a programming bounty. The memory requirement is 2 MB Chip and 1 MB Fast RAM.

T. rhombus is given its name for the appearance of the fins that run the length of the mantle. They are a fast growing species with a lifespan of approximately 1 year. The diamond squid is the only cephalopod species known to be monogamous. T. rhombus often preys on fish and other small cephalopods at varying water depths. This species is commercially fished in Japan, specifically in the Sea of Japan and Okinawa.  Description  Thysanoteuthis rhombus are distinguishable by the presence of arms with two series of suckers, whereas the tentacular clubs have four. It lacks photophores. T. rhombus is named for its fins, which run in equal length along the mantle, giving the appearance of a rhombus. The species is able to grow up to 100 cm (3.3 ft) in mantle length and a maximum weight of 30 kg, although it averages around 20 kg. T. rhombus is not an active swimmer and propels itself slowly using its triangular fins, although the species is able to make powerful contractions of its mantle to escape predation. T. rhombus in the Gulf of Naples. The lifespan of T. rhombus is 1 year. Males mature at a mantle length between 400 to 550mm (170 to 200 days of age) while females mature at a mantle length between 550 to 650mm (230 to 250 days).  Behavior  The species is one of the only cephalopods observed exhibiting pair-like mating relationships. If one member of a male-female mating pair is caught by squid fishermen, the other will likely remain in the area until it is also caught. The species feeds during the daytime at deep water levels and during the night at shallow water levels. T. rhombus are often found in pairs , but groups up to 20 have been recorded . T. rhombus typically inhabits open ocean waters of the subtropical and tropical locations with temperatures of >20¬∞C. The diamond squid was found to be largely inactive or even die at depths of 0‚Äì100m due to sudden drops in temperatures below 15¬∞C.  Diet  In subsurface water levels, T. rhombus juveniles were found to feed on crustaceans, small cephalopods and fishes. As adults, the stomach contents of the Diamond squid were found to consist mostly of nonactive fishes at water depths of 400 to 650m.  Predation  The predators that feed on T. rhombus include various species of ommastrephid squids, dolphin fish, lancet fish, tuna, swordfish, Gempylus serpens, and sharks. Other predators include mammals such as dolphins, rough-toothed dolphin, false killer whale and sperm whale. Reproduction Thysanoteuthis rhombus egg mass (diameter ca. 1m) in the waters between Tenerife and La Gomera. The pairing of males and females occurs at an immature stage where mantle length is less than 100mm and pairs remain monogamous. Mating occurs in a head-to-head position, in which the male uses its hectocotylus to attach to the female's buccal membrane to transfer its spermatophores. Spawning is year round in tropical waters and lasts for 2‚Äì3 months, but in temperate regions spawning is more restricted to summer or early autumn periods and warmer currents. T. rhombus is known to be an intermittent spawner and is known to have multiple spawning in succession. Females will produce secretions of gel-like substance from nidamental glands, similar to the Japanese flying squid, during spawning that will enter the water and swell. This swollen secretion will then be molded by the female into a cylinder. Female's oviductal glands will then begin to form two mucous threads, each with one row of eggs, which will fuse into a single cord containing a double row of eggs in the mantle cavity. The fused cord exits through into the water through the funnel where the eggs are met and fertilized with spermatozoa from seminal receptacles that were attached to the female's buccal membrane. The fertilized egg cord is then wound onto the cylinder. A female can produce 8 to 12 masses if properly utilizing its vitelline oocytes.  Commercial value  T. rhombus is targeted by growing fisheries in near southern and central Japan due to its firm and flavorful flesh. The main fishing grounds are in the Sea of Japan, Okinawa Prefecture, and Kagoshima Prefecture. Majority, about 90%, of captures are located in the Sea of Japan and Okinawa. The Sea of Japan fishery runs from July to February, while the fishery in Okinawa runs primarily between November to April. To capture the diamond squid in the Sea of Japan, inshore trap nets and free- floating angling gear called \\"taru-nagashi\\" are used. In Okinawa, free- floating angling gear called \\"Hata-nagashi\\" is used for capture. \\"Taru- nagashi\\" is gear that consists of a vertical weighted long line with two or three artificial lures and with two or three rows of stainless steel hooks. At the other end of the line, an orange fluorescent buoy lays on its side on the surface until a squid hooks onto the line, which causes buoy stands up to alert the fisherman. The caught squid are pulled up by hand or by using a winch, so it is primarily used during the day. \\"Hata-nagashi\\" is gear that was adapted for the oceanographic conditions of Okinawa Prefecture. It has several artificial lures attached to a longer main line than those used in the Sea of Japan. The line is attached to several buoys and a flag at the surface. This gear lead to the increase of catches of T. rhombus. See also *Cephalopod size *Humboldt squid References * Tokalau, T. 2014. Giant squid market.

Gloria Arellanes and Gracie and Hilda Reyes were all former members of the Brown Berets, another Mexican American Civil rights organization that had operated concurrently during the 1960s and 1970s in the California area. The founders left the Brown Berets due to enlarging gender discrepancies and disagreements that caused much alienation amongst their female members. The Las Adelitas De Aztlan advocated for Mexican-American Civil rights, better conditions for workers, protested police brutality and advocated for women's rights for the Latino community. The name of the organization was a tribute to Mexican female soldiers or soldaderas that fought during the Mexican Revolution of the early twentieth century.  Inspiration  Throughout the Chicano Movement during the 1960s and 1970s Mexican American civil rights movements were at their peak, and one of the most prominent was the Brown Berets. The Brown Berets expressed a combination of civic activism and cultural and ethnic unity, but with elements of militarism to advocate for farm worker's rights, educational reform, anti-war activism and to organize against police brutality. Female members of the Brown Berets served as a valuable asset to the organization and \\" gave the organization stability by fundraising, answering phone calls, writing letters, pasting up and writing for the newspaper, and running free clinics. They also became instrumental in organizing the marches against the Vietnam War\\". All three original founders of Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n, Gloria Arellanes and Gracie and Hilda Reyes had formerly been a part of the Brown Berets, but had felt that the male-dominated leadership was ignoring the demands and concerns of their female members. Though it was clear that women played a critical role in the organization some felt that the secretarial and clerical positions had devalued them as members. With the rise of second-wave feminism in the 1960s women across the racial spectrum beginning expressing a type of gender consciousness that rejected notions of passiveness or submission to male domination in civil rights circles. Many would even break away entirely to start their own organizations. In February 1970 Arellanes, then the minister of correspondence and finance for the East Los Angeles chapter had handed in her letter of resignation to the Brown Berets's Minister of Education Aron Mangancilla stating \\"There has been a great exclusion on behalf of the male segment and failure of the ministers to communicate with us, among many, many other things\\".Ibid. Arellanes had set a precedent that had echoed along with other second wave feminists at the time that despite being a member of an oppressed class of people, the female component of the Mexican American community had often been sidelined via male dominance. Shortly after her resignation Arellanes began organizing a new group at the Euclid Heights Center in East Los Angeles and advertised it as an organization where Chicanas could express themselves and their ideas or a place where the dissatisfied could find a place to be included and welcomed. Gloria Arellanes discusses the reasoning of why she named the group Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n saying in the book The Chicano Movement Testimonios Of The Movement, \\"I had come to learn more about the history of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and was fascinated by the image of La Adelita, the female revolutionary who fought in the revolution‚Ä¶ This was part of the Chicana search for historical role models\\". She continues to speak about the importance of Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n, saying that the group helped to give birth to Chicana feminism. As a group, Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n discussed how they were treated as women, and talked about Machismo, specifically the macho mentality of Mexican American males. The group adopted the following slogan: \\"Porque somos una familia de hermana (Because we are a family of sisters)\\".Ibid  Gloria Arellanes's backgrounds  Gloria Arellanes was born on March 4, 1946, in East Los Angeles. Throughout her early life she became accustomed to the systemic racism and discrimination that had plagued the Mexican American community for decades. The post World War two political economy had caused great demographic shifts in the Los Angeles area and even allowed some Mexican American families like her own to have access to social mobility, as well as middle-class lifestyles. However, much of these changes caused tension between Whites and Mexican Americans, and increased clashes between the two communities had occurred. Arellanes experienced these tensions first hand and sought community organization and guidance as a way to find a sense of security and comfort from police brutality and vigilante attacks. Arellanes later expressed that \\"I got involved with community services here with Chicano groups‚Ä¶ we stuck together because there were race riots in the high school I went to, El Monte High School, and the police would come into the halls of the high school on their motorcycles and just arrest the Chicanos. They never arrested the white students\\". [3] It was for these reasons that Arellanes looked toward the Brown Berets for a sense of structure, security, and community organization that many other young Mexican Americans were striving for. Arellanes recalls \\" There was something there that attracted us, and so I wanted to know more‚Äù. The Brown Berets sent a strong message in the communities that they were active in, and gave young Mexican Americans a new avenue of expression and a political voice, but this same organization would, unfortunately, alienate many of the people that were involved, most notably women. This caused great concern for Arellanes and would eventually cause her to leave the organization altogether and create her own.  Important contributions  The Las Adelitas de Aztlan advocated heavily for women's reproductive rights and care, such as having access to free or reduced birth control, abortions, sex education, and even childcare. Much of this stemmed from the creation of health clinics in Mexican-American communities across the American Southwest. While still under the banner of the Brown Berets Arellanes worked closely in the establishments of the barrio Free Clinic in East Los Angeles in 1969, one of the first free clinics in a Spanish speaking neighborhood in Los Angeles. The establishment of free clinics was important for Arellanes, and she would carry on this sentiment into the Las Adelitas de Aztlan. The group would attend the Conferencia de Mujeres por la Raza or National Chicana Conference, the first of its kind in 1971 in Houston on May 28‚Äì30, 1971. Here along with other Mexican-American civil rights organizations Chicana women \\" gathered to organize stronger positions regarding women's roles. Gender discrimination, abortion, and birth control were given as much importance at the conference as inadequate educational opportunities, racism, welfare support, and employment discrimination, issues always at the heart of the Mexican-American civil-rights agenda. In addition, conference speakers urged the participants to work to change society\\".  Expressions of femininity  The rise of Second-wave feminism coincided with that of the civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and would have a critical impact on the creation of Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n. The organization's goal, alongside the promotion of Mexican-American civil rights, was to provide a safe space, or a location for female expression. The Chicana feminist ideology that took hold during this time aligned itself with American East coast interpretations of femininity. It denounced patriarchal male domination of women, both in private and public life. It also demanded accountability for actions that hindered the ability of female community members from having access to occupational, educational, political, and social opportunities and expression. However, women in the Mexican-American community faced unique challenges being members of a historically oppressed class of citizens, and focused on issues that carried with it racial and ethnic components. Women such as Gloria Arellanes and Gracie and Hilda Reyes often worked in concert with the larger Chicano civil rights movement in order to achieve their goals. The coordination of both males and females in the Mexican-American community allowed \\"Chicana women to find a collective voice through feminism and began to question machismo (sexist) attitudes, articulating their own criticisms and concerns involving issues of gender and sexuality, and organizing around these issues\\". Some of the motives of the organization's founders stressed that they did not intend to reveal the Browns Berets, though some their contemporaries felt that it was a direct challenge Brown Berets as an institution. Arellanes argued that, \\" We envision strong women who would be supportive and always back one another up. Was it a feminist group?...I didn't call myself a feminist, nor did the other beret women, but in retrospect we were feminist in fact and in action\\".  Expressions of Chicano Nationalism  The American civil rights period was a critical stepping stone for the Mexican American community to carve out a sense of cultural or Chicano nationalism that would be used as a platform to create a shared identity and respect. Creating a shared identity was important for the Chicano movement as a whole, as a result the Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n would be used as way to express these ideas. The name of the organization was chosen carefully to achieve this goal, as \\"a feminist symbol of the Mexican Revolution, La Adelita was the name of a women soldier, a soldadera, who followed the troops, helped set up camp, and cooked for the soldiers\\". MAking reference to the Mexican Revolution invoked nationalist sentiment amongst Mexican-Americans by appealing to a history where the Mexican people fought to preserve their way of life, and also the fight against tyranny or persecution. In addition, making specific references to female soldiers was also deliberate to promote feminist ideology in the group and elsewhere. the image of the soldaders portrayed women as strong, brave, independent, and able to take on any task a man could do. The name Aztlan has indigenous origin, but was also critical in creating nationalist sentiment. The Mexican-American community also recognized its Spanish and Indian past, and groups such Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n would use it as a way to create nationalist appeal. In Chicano Folklore and history \\"Aztlan is the mythical place of origin of the Aztec peoples...In Chicano folklore, Aztlan is often appropriated as the name for that portion of Mexico that was taken over by the United States after the Mexican-American War of 1846, in the belief that this greater area represents the point of parting of the Aztec migrations\\". This geographic area holds deep cultural significance for the Mexican-American community, and because it is seen as their place of origin they believe that they should not be deprived of their dignity and humanity from people that are often seen as outsiders such as White Americans that had migrated from the East coast. It was for this reason that the Las Adelitas de Aztl√°n is not only an important symbol for Chicana feminism, but also Chicano nationalism.

Speed 50x. From Santos E et al. Neuroimage 2014. 323x323px Cortical spreading depression (CSD) or spreading depolarization is a wave of electrophysiological hyperactivity followed by a wave of inhibition.Dodick DW & Gargus JJ (August 2008). \\"Why migraines strike\\". Scientific American. Spreading depolarization describes a phenomenon characterized by the appearance of depolarization waves of the neurons and neuroglia that propagates across the cortex at a velocity of 1.5‚Äì9.5 mm/min. CSD can be induced by hypoxic conditions and facilitates neuronal death in energy-compromised tissue. CSD has also been implicated in migraine aura, where CSD is assumed to ascend in well-nourished tissue and is typically benign in most of the cases, although it may increase the probability in migraine patients to develop a stroke. Spreading depolarization within brainstem tissues regulating functions crucial for life has been implicated in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, by way of ion channel mutations such as those seen in Dravet syndrome, a particularly severe form of childhood epilepsy that appears to carry an unusually high risk of SUDEP. Uses of the term Neuroscientists use the term cortical spreading depression to represent at least one of the following cortical processes: * The spreading of a self-propagating wave of cellular depolarization in the cerebral cortex. * The spreading of a wave of ischemia passing through an area of cortex. * The spreading of a wave of vasoconstriction following vasodilation and prolonged sustained vasoconstriction of contiguous cortical arterioles. The scintillating scotoma of migraine in humans may be related to the neurophysiologic phenomenon termed the spreading depression of Le√£o. Increased extracellular potassium ion concentration and excitatory glutamate contribute to the initiation and propagation of cortical spreading depression, which is the underlying cause of migraine aura.Richter and Lehmenk√ºhler (2008) Chronic daily administration of migraine prophylactic drugs (topiramate, valproate, propranolol, amitriptyline, and methysergide) dose-dependently suppressed frequency of CSD induced by continuous cortical application of 1 M KCl solution. However lamotrigine (a drug with specific anti-aura action, but no efficacy in migraine in general) has a marked suppressive effect which correlates with its rather selective action on the migraine aura. Valproate and riboflavin were shown to have no effect on the triggering of cortical spreading depression though they are effective in migraine without aura. Taken together, these results are compatible with a causal role of cortical spreading depression in migraine with aura, but not in migraine without aura. The folded structure of the cerebral cortex is capable of irregular and complex CSD propagation patterns. The irregularities of the folded cortex and the vasculature promote the presence of re-entrance waves, such as spirals and reverberating waves. The expansion of the wave then is less predictable and it is affected by the concentration of different molecules and gradients on the cortex. Its triggers and propagation mechanisms, as well as clinical manifestations of CSD, are a therapeutic target to reduce brain damage after a stroke or brain lesion.

He was made a cardinal in November 2007. In the international media, he was mentioned as a possible contender to succeed Benedict XVI, who resigned in 2013. He also holds the position of Grand-Chancellor of the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (PUC-SP), one of the largest and most prestigious universities in Brazil. Biography =Early life and ordination= Scherer is German Brazilian and was born in Cerro Largo, Rio Grande do Sul, to Edwino and Francisca (n√©e Steffens) Scherer. He is a nephew of Alfredo Scherer (1903‚Äì96), who was Cardinal Archbishop of Porto Alegre. His father's family emigrated from Tholey, Saarland. His mother was also descended from immigrants from Saarland. After attending the minor and major seminaries in Curitiba, Scherer studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° and the Pontifical Gregorian University (from where he obtained his Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1991) in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Armando C√≠rio, OSI, on December 7, 1976. =Professor and curialist= He served as director and professor at the diocesan seminary of Cascavel (1977‚Äì1978), the diocesan seminary of Toledo (1979‚Äì1982, 1993), and the Centro Interdiocesano de Teologia de Cascavel (1991‚Äì1993). Before doing pastoral work in Toledo from 1985 to 1988, Scherer taught philosophy at the Ci√™ncias Humanas Arnaldo Busatto (1980‚Äì1985), and theology at the Instituto Teol√≥gico Paulo VI (1985). He then taught at the Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paran√° until 1994. From 1994 to 2001, he was an official of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia, while serving as a Roman pastor and chaplain during his spare time.Whispers in the Loggia. Benedictine Rule: You Pick Your Successor March 21, 2007 During those years in Europe Scherer also on various occasions studied the German language at the Goethe-Institut in Staufen im Breisgau. =Bishop and Archbishop= On November 28, 2001, Scherer was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of S√£o Paulo and Titular Bishop of Novi. He received his episcopal consecration on February 2, 2002, from Cardinal Cl√°udio Hummes, OFM, with Archbishops Armando C√≠rio and Anuar Battisti serving as co-consecrators. He was made Secretary General of the Brazilian Episcopal Conference in 2003. In this way, he also became the Grand- Chancellor of the Pontifical Catholic University of S√£o Paulo (PUC-SP). =Cardinal= Pope Benedict XVI named Scherer as the seventh Archbishop of S√£o Paulo on March 21, 2007. He replaced Cardinal Hummes, who was made Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy. His appointment brought an end to almost four decades of Franciscan leadership of the archdiocese; before Hummes, Paulo Evaristo Arns led the diocese for 28 years. Scherer accompanied Pope Benedict for a great part of his visit to Brazil in May 2007, which was largely held in the former's see of S√£o Paulo, and he delivered a speech during a ceremony to celebrate the Pope's arrival. On October 17, 2007, the Pope announced that he would make Scherer a Cardinal. Scherer was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory at St. Peter's Basilica on November 24, 2007, becoming Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale. On June 12, 2008, he was appointed by Benedict as a member of the Congregation for the Clergy. On January 5, 2011, he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. On November 30, 2013, he was named a Member of the Congregation for Catholic Education by Pope Francis. Coronavirus pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cardinal Scherer as Archbishop of S√£o Paulo defended that churches remain open, but with a greater number of liturgical celebrations per day, in an attempt to prevent large gatherings. Later, he declared the suspension of celebrations with the people. Views =General outlook= Scherer is considered to be theologically moderate.BBC Brazil. Papa nomeia Dom Odilo Scherer para Arquidiocese de SP March 21, 2007 He is one of just a handful of cardinals that use modern social media routinely. =Evangelization= Arms of Cardinal Scherer According to a July 23, 2010, article by the website of the Catholic Zenit News Agency, Cardinal Scherer thinks there is an \\"evangelization deficit\\" around the globe today, which is why Pope Benedict established a new division of the Roman Curia to deal with that issue. Cardinal Scherer was quoted in the article as saying that the Pope \\"brings all to understand that this [new evangelization] is an objective of his, and that it must be the attitude of the Church worldwide, to respond to the challenges launched by the present 'change of age in the history of humanity.'\\" =Abortion= Cardinal Scherer asked Brazilians that if the country's Supreme Court legalizes abortion for fetus' with anencephaly, what will be the next group ‚Äòincompatible with life‚Äô to be eliminated? =Liberation theology= He once criticized liberation theology's use of \\"Marxism as a tool of analysis,\\" but supported its focus on social injustice and poverty (as fully in keeping with established, orthodox Catholic doctrine on these issues). =Secularism in Brazil= Cardinal Scherer has argued that removing crucifixes in public places would not be in the best interests of Brazilian secularism. =Priests and the liturgy= In reference to the popular Brazilian priest Marcelo Rossi, Scherer stated that, \\"Priests aren't showmen. ...The Mass is not to be transformed into a show\\".

It is not named for its length. Locals guess that both the beach and the creek that runs onto it‚ÄîShort Creek, several miles in length‚Äîwere named after an early resident of the area. Just south of Cape Meares State Park, and a bit north of Oceanside, the beach is hidden from the land except for a brief stretch of road which crosses the dam across Short Creek. The seasonal shingle beach is noted for the availability of agates, (the beach is sometimes erroneously called \\"Agate Beach\\") and jasper, sometimes called \\"coastal jade\\" or \\"beach jade\\". Agates and jasper become more available after heavy winter or spring storms, which often cause landslides or rockfalls, bringing fresh parent rock to the beach, where the upper slope is a rock berm. These rock collapses eventually become the smooth, rounded rock familiar on beaches by the pounding surf that brought them down. Other attractions are the mussels, which can be gathered from offshore rocks at low tides, surf fishing, and beach fires. An occasional surfer may be seen, as well as paragliders who, now that there is safe access, sometimes land on the beach. Offshore, and partly onshore, are a number of rocks belonging to the Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. In recent years, both these and the higher land around Short Beach have suffered significant erosion ‚Äî collapse of rock faces and shoreward erosion along the bluff of over five feet in the last decade.

It depicts Russian schoolchildren in a classroom with a bust of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin. The painting is shown at the National Museum of American Illustration. Description Russian Schoolroom depicts a group of seated and attentive Soviet schoolchildren looking towards the viewer‚Äôs left, presumably at a teacher outside the visual frame. A bust of V.I. Lenin with strewn flowers is, however, partially visible there. The children wear red Young Communist neckerchiefs and a Russian slogan on the wall behind them exhorts them to ‚ÄúStudy and Learn‚Äù. One pupil on the right, however, looks away to the viewer‚Äôs right, like a typical schoolboy losing focus and finding something more interesting to see outdoors. Background Russian Schoolroom was published in the October 3, 1967, edition of Look as part of a series of articles on life in the Soviet Union. Rockwell had visited School No. 29 in Moscow where he drew puppy sketches on a chalkboard. Reference photos of the Moscow classroom with pupils, taken as a model for Rockwell‚Äôs final painting, reveal that the inattentive pupil is actually paying close attention to the teacher, with eyes front. It has been suggested that in changing this detail, Rockwell slightly subverted the image to make a subtle political point in favor of non- conformity. Additional reference photos show Rockwell himself sitting in that student's seat, apparently demonstrating a distracted look, which the student then emulated. Theft and litigation The painting was stolen during an exhibit at a small art gallery in Clayton, Missouri, in June 1973. In 1988, it turned up and was sold at an auction in New Orleans for about $70,000. Steven Spielberg bought the painting from Judy Goffman Cutler, a noted art dealer who specialized in American illustrators, in 1989 for $200,000. A member of his staff spotted the painting on an FBI web listing of stolen works of art and the authorities were immediately notified. By 2009, the painting was in the custody of the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. The court decided in 2010 that the painting belonged to Cutler, who has added it to the collection on display at the National Museum of American Illustration.

The eleventh poem in the collection called The Lais of Marie de France, its subject is an episode from the romance of Tristan and Iseult. The title means \\"honeysuckle,\\" a symbol of love in the poem. \\"Chevrefoil\\" consists of 118 lines and survives in two manuscripts, Harley 978 or MS H, which contains all the Lais, and in Biblioth√®que Nationale, nouv. acq. fr. 1104, or MS S.The Lais of Marie de France, pp. 7‚Äì8. Summary The lai begins with a statement that others have sung it previously, and that the author has seen it in written form.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 109. The story tells of the love between the knight Tristan and his uncle's wife Iseult, which, according to Marie, was so pure that it eventually caused their deaths on the same day. Tristan has been exiled from Cornwall by his uncle Mark for his adulterous transgressions, and is forced to return to his homeland in South Wales. After pining away for a year, Tristan hears news that Mark is planning a great feast for Pentecost at Tintagel, and Iseult will be present. On the day the king's court sets out, Tristan takes to the woods, where he cuts a hazel branch into an appropriate signal and carves his name into it. Marie says Iseult will be on the lookout for such a sign, since Tristan has contacted her in a similar manner in the past. Immediately recognizing the branch as Tristan's, Iseult asks her party to stop and rest, and goes out in the woods with only her faithful servant Brangaine. The lovers spend their time together, and Iseult tells Tristan how he can win back his uncle's favor. When it comes time to leave, the lovers weep, and Tristan returns to Wales to wait for his uncle's word. Lines 68 through 78 compare Tristan and Iseult's love to the intertwining of the honeysuckle with the hazel; the two plants grow so entwined that both will die if they are separated. Marie says the original author of the lai was none other than Tristan, an accomplished bard who put his thoughts into a song at Iseult's request. According to Marie, \\"Chevrefoil\\" is the French name for the poem; it is called \\"Gotelef\\" (Goatleaf) in English.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 110. Allusions and significance Similar episodes to that recounted in \\"Chevrefoil\\" appear in longer Tristan poems; it is feasible that Marie drew her material from a longer source.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 26. Though there are several allusions to the greater Tristan and Iseult cycle, such as Tintagel and the character Brangaine, Marie is unique in placing Tristan's homeland in South Wales, rather than Cornwall or the fictitious Lyonesse. A testament to Marie's popularity appears in Gerbert's Continuation to Chr√©tien de Troyes's unfinished romance Perceval, the Story of the Grail, which contains an episode in which a disguised Tristan plays the lay of \\"Chevrefoil\\" to his unsuspecting lover at a tournament.Perceval, p. 215. \\"Chevrefoil\\" is one of Marie's several lais concerning an adulterous love. It is also one of several which deal with the sexual frustration suffered by a young woman who has been married to an older man.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 10. Like other lais, prominence is given to the analysis of the characters' emotions and to the contrast between the ideals of love and the needs of reality. It has been speculated that Marie arranged her poems as they appear in MS H in order to pair a short, tragic poem with a longer one on the power of love and the importance of fidelity. If this is true, \\"Chevrefoil\\" may be paired with \\"Eliduc,\\" the final poem in the collection.The Lais of Marie de France, p. 14. One of the most discussed features of the lai is the hazel branch Tristan leaves for Iseult. The poet indicates that Tristan carves his name on the branch; it is unclear if he also leaves a fuller message. In any case Iseult interprets it correctly. Glyn Burgess suggests the branch is merely a signal Tristan has already told Iseult about in an earlier message; the poet indicates that Iseult would be on the lookout for the branch, \\"for this had all happened before\\".Burgess 1987 Others have read the poem as indicating that Tristan has left a longer message, perhaps lines 77-78, or the entirety of lines 61-78.Whalen, pp. 80‚Äì81. In such a case the message may have been transcribed in notches on the branch, perhaps in the ogham alphabet, or in a fashion similar to the tally stick. Like the other Lais, \\"Chevrefoil\\" was adapted into other languages. It was translated as \\"Geitarlauf\\" in the Old Norse version of Marie's Lais known as Strengleikar, perhaps written by Brother Robert. Notes References *Burgess, Glyn S.

It was composed of German officers and Bosnian Muslim soldiers. Named Kama after a small dagger used by Balkan shepherds, it was one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS during World War II. Formed on 19 June 1944, it was built around a cadre from the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) but did not reach its full strength and never saw action as a formation. Elements of the division fought briefly against Soviet forces in southern Hungary in early October 1944 alongside the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. They were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun a move to the German puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, to join the 13th SS Division when the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the Kama division mutinied on 17 October 1944. The cadre quickly regained control, but the mutiny resulted in the division being formally dissolved on 31 October 1944. Background After the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941, the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, was appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi- protectorate\\". NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e Militia, immediately launched a campaign of mass killings, expulsions and forced religious conversions to Catholicism targeting the Serbian Orthodox population living within the borders of the new state. Despite Paveliƒá's assurances of equality with the predominantly Catholic Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Usta≈°e rule. An Islamic leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. By early 1942, fierce fighting had broken out between the Usta≈°e, Chetniks and Partisans in NDH territory. Some Usta≈°e militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Usta≈°e violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the Croatian Home Guard, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as \\"of minimal combat value\\". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the Tuzla-based Home Guard \\"Had≈æiefendiƒá Legion\\" led by Muhamed Had≈æiefendiƒá, was of any significance. The Bosnian Muslims sought protection and independence from the NDH, and saw German support as a means to achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Paveliƒá as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect their people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because he did not want to create problems for Paveliƒá, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler saw this as an opportunity to create a Waffen-SS recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims. In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-Germanic people, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH. History SS Oberf√ºhrer Gustav Lombard commanded an alt=German officer in uniform The Germans wanted to recruit a second SS division from the Muslims of Bosnia, as part of Himmler's goal to expand Waffen-SS recruiting in the Balkans. His plan was to form two corps of two divisions, with one corps to operate in the Bosnian region of the Independent State of Croatia and the other in Albania. These corps would then be combined with the Volksdeutsche 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and together would form a Balkan SS mountain army of five divisions. On 28 May 1944, Hitler gave his formal approval for the creation of a 23rd SS Division, with its formation to begin on 10 June and training to be complete by the end of 1944. Himmler followed the advice of the commander of the 13th SS Division Handschar, SS Brigadef√ºhrer and Generalmajor of Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig, and agreed to form the division in the neighbouring B√°cska () region annexed by Hungary instead of Bosnia. Sauberzweig believed that if the division was raised in the NDH, the Usta≈°e would undermine the morale of the recruits. The new division was named Kama after a small dagger used by Balkan shepherds. Orders were given to the 13th SS Division to provide a cadre for the new division, and SS Standartenf√ºhrer (Colonel) Helmuth Raithel, a regimental commander from the 13th SS Division, was appointed as the new division's commanding officer. The formation of the division was delayed by Operation Vollmond to which the 13th SS Division was heavily committed, so formation did not begin until 19 June. On 21 June, Himmler promoted Sauberzweig to SS Gruppenf√ºhrer and Generalleutnant of Waffen-SS (major general) and appointed him to command the Bosnian corps, which was given the title IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian). The corps was to form at B√°csalm√°s in southern Hungary, where the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel was deployed. Beginning on 23 June, 54 officers, 187 non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and 1,137 enlisted men of the 13th SS Division that had been selected for transfer to the 23rd SS Division Kama were assembled in Bo≈°njaci in Posavina County of the NDH, and they were moved into B√°cska on 15 July. They included three NCOs from every company of the 13th SS Division, and one cavalry squadron, one battery from each of its artillery battalions, as well as specialist troops. German officers and NCOs were also provided by Waffen-SS replacement units. The divisional area lay along the Franzen Canal, with garrisons in Szenttam√°s () and K√∫la () and on either side of the line Zombor-Verb√°sz (). The 10,000 men for a full-strength division were to be obtained from volunteers, from Muslim conscripts born in 1926 and 1927 (with some exceptions), and if necessary, from the various Muslim militias in the NDH. The conscripts were subjected to the draft by the NDH government then transferred to German command along with the others, who were then transported to Waffen-SS recruiting depots at Zombor and Bo≈°njaci. These men were to report by 15 September 1944, but in mid- August, Waffen-SS recruiting officer SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer (Lieutenant General) Gottlob Berger reported to Himmler that there would be insufficient reliable Muslim men available, and Catholic Croats would also have to be accepted into the 23rd SS Division. During Paveliƒá's visit to Hitler in September 1944, General ƒêuro Grujiƒá, chief of Paveliƒá's Military Office, indicated to the Germans that it would be difficult to recruit another 5,000 men to complete the division after 5,000 had already been assigned. Many Volksdeutsche from the NDH and a few from Hungary were recruited into the division to act as interpreters between the Bosnian Muslims and the German cadre and to enhance unit cohesion. On 10 September the division reached a strength of 126 officers, 374 non-commissioned officers and 3,293 men, composed of German officers and Bosnian Muslim soldiers, a fraction of its prescribed strength of 19,000 men. By this time, morale was waning within the new division just as it completed the final phase of its training in Hungary; the war was not going well, and there were rumours that the Germans were going to abandon the Balkans and leave the Muslims to defend themselves. Faced with high rates of desertion from the 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed a plan to disarm the Bosnians in both divisions, and on 18 September travelled to see Himmler. The Reichsf√ºhrer-SS instead opted for a plan to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division to the area of operations of the 13th SS Division in Bosnia and re-organise both divisions there. Combat arms units from the 13th SS Division were to be brought under the direct control of IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian), which would also move to Bosnia. Issued on 24 September, the plan cancelled the formation of the 23rd SS Division, and directed SS Oberf√ºhrer (Senior Colonel) Gustav Lombard to form and command a new SS infantry division using the German cadre and equipment of the 23rd SS Division, supplemented by ethnic Germans recruited from Hungary. The Bosnians of the 23rd SS Division were to be transported by rail back to the Gradi≈°te- ≈Ωupanja-Bo≈°njaci area for re-organisation into a \\"new\\" Kama division. The staff of IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian) headquarters left Hungary, and on 3 October 1944 they arrived in the village of Andrija≈°evci, near Vinkovci. The headquarters became partially operational on 7 October. The Bosnians did not leave B√°cska immediately, and for a short period were garrisoned alongside Lombard's new 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. In the meantime, the Red Army continued to advance into Hungary, and on 9 October 1944 a telegram was sent by the commander of Waffen-SS forces in Hungary to IX SS Mountain Corps in Bosnia announcing that \\"battle ready units from SS Oberf√ºhrer Lombard's division and Bosnians from the Division Kama had been thrown into the fighting in Bacska\\". The Bosnian elements were deployed along the Tisza () river for a week or so as part of Kampfgruppe Syr in an attempt to slow the Soviet advance. As a result, the return of the Bosnians to the NDH was delayed. The Bosnians were soon disengaged from the front line in Hungary and had begun the move to Bosnia to join the 13th SS Division when they mutinied on 17 October 1944. Raithel quickly regained control, but the mutiny meant the re-organisation of a \\"new\\" 23rd SS Division was abandoned. A small number of reliable Bosnians from the division were used as replacements in the 13th SS Division, and the 23rd SS Division was formally dissolved on 31 October 1944. Despite its short existence, the 23rd SS is considered one of the thirty-eight divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS during World War II. After the division was disbanded, the numerical designator \\"23rd\\" was given to the 23rd SS Volunteer Panzer Grenadier Division Nederland, and Raithel went on to command the 11th SS-Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment \\"Reinhard Heydrich\\" of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord against the United States Army in southern Germany during the final months of World War II. Order of battle The division's final order of battle consisted of: * 55th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger (Mountain Infantry) Regiment of the SS (3rd Croatian) * 56th Waffen Gebirgsj√§ger Regiment of the SS (4th Croatian) * 23rd SS Mountain Artillery Regiment (of four battalions) * 23rd SS Reconnaissance Battalion * 23rd SS Panzerj√§ger (Anti-tank) Battalion * 23rd SS Pioneer Battalion * 23rd SS Mountain Signals Battalion * 23rd SS Division Supply Battalion * 23rd SS Medical Battalion * 23rd SS Replacement Battalion The division also included a workshop company, veterinary company and administrative section. Uniform The divisional insignia was a sun with 16 rays, the ancient symbol of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional collar patch bearing the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the B√°cska region during the summer of 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. These non-standard uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.

At age seven he began to learn to play the piano and by twelve was studying at the Music Institute in Krak√≥w. In 1925, he began to study art history at Warsaw University. Palester graduated from the Warsaw Conservatory with a degree in music theory and composition in 1931, having studied under Kazimierz Sikorski.\\"Palester Roman\\". Polskie Centrum Informacji Muzycznej. Retrieved on 12 May 2007. His first recognition came in 1932 when his \\"Psalm V for baritone, choir and orchestra\\" was awarded first place in the Competition of the Singers‚Äô Societies Association . Palester travelled extensively during his life and lived for times in Warsaw, Paris, and Munich. He was outspoken on political matters and during the Second World War was briefly imprisoned in Warsaw's Pawiak prison. However, his reputation recovered, and by the late 1940s, he was widely regarded as one of Poland's greatest living composers, alongside Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz and Andrzej Panufnik. While in Munich, Palester worked for Radio Free Europe, as the head of its Polish culture department and as the presenter of a series entitled \\"Music Abolishes the Frontiers\\". Both the station's acutely anti-communist stance and his own refusal to adopt the principles of Socialist Realism lead to Palester being exiled from Poland, and the communist officials expunged both his name and scores from official publications and prohibited public performances of his work. He continued to compose abroad, and from the mid-1950s Palester experimented with twelve-tone serialism. In 1963, he completed what has been described as his greatest work, \\"≈ömierƒá Don Juana\\" (\\"Don Juan‚Äôs Death\\").Go≈ÇƒÖb, Maciej. \\"The First Polish Composer of Twelve-Tone Music \\". Polish Music Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Summer 2003. Retrieved on 15 May 2007. Although his compositions were highly regarded across Europe, it was not until the late 1970s that the Polish Composers' Union lifted the censorship ban on his work. In recent years, Palester‚Äôs music has largely fallen from the public view, in part due to his emigration to France early in his life. He remains highly regarded amongst specialists, but to date no revival of his work has caught the mainstream imagination. In 1999, Zofia Helman wrote a monograph on his work in an attempt to restore Palester's position as a significant modern Polish composer. Describing Palester's individuality, Helman wrote that he stood as an example of \\"new compositional thinking, different not only from the musical production of the early 1950s that was burdened by Socialist Realist ideology, but also from the autonomous Neoclassical current that remained dominant among Polish composers\\".Helman, Zofia (1999). \\"Roman Palester - An Artist and His Work\\".

In 1882, the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors' decision to allow Hall to be admitted to the Connecticut Bar was the first judicial decision in the nation to hold that women were permitted to practice law.Matthew G. Berger, Mary Hall: The Decision and the Lawyer, 79 Conn. Bar J. 29 (2005). Early life Mary Hall was born in Marlborough, Connecticut, one of seven children of Gustavus E. Hall and Louisa (Skinner) Hall. Gustavus Hall was a prosperous farmer and miller, known to be one of liberal convictions. Hall graduated from Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, in 1866. She was an accomplished poet, winning a medal for her commencement poem and having her poems published in newspapers. Hall then went on to teach mathematics at the LaSalle Seminary near Boston, where she became the Chair of Mathematics.Dwight Loomis & J. Gilbert Calhoun, Judicial and Civil History of Connecticut 509 (1895); Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame, http://www.cfhw.org/hall/hall/hall/htm. In 1877, Hall decided to pursue the study of law. She approached her brother, Ezra, who was already an attorney and Connecticut State Senator, about her decision. Although he gave her no encouragement, upon her insistence, he gave her a copy of difficult legal work. After watching her study the work with great enthusiasm, Ezra decided to allow Hall to apprentice in his office. However, Ezra died a few months later in April 1878. John Hooker, the Clerk of the Supreme Court of Errors, took Hall in as his apprentice, beginning on April 2, 1879. That year, Belva Lockwood became the first woman admitted to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court. Hall studied law and copied and prepared judicial opinions under Hooker's supervision and instruction for over three years. On April 2, 1880, while studying law, Hall founded the Good Will Club, a charity for underprivileged boys, particularly newspaper boys. The program provided education as well as vocational training. The Club began with nine boys, but eventually grew to 3.000 boys, with its own facilities and newspaper called \\"The Good Will Star.\\" Despite her eventual practice of law, the Club was \\"Mary Hall's first priority, and her life's work.\\" Pursuit of becoming a lawyer In 1882, at the age of 38, Mary Hall made her application to the Connecticut Bar. She passed an examination on March 22, 1882. On March 24, 1882, the Hartford Bar Association held a regular meeting at which Hooker moved to have Hall admitted to the usual examination before the Bar Examining Committee, attesting that she had studied law in his office for three years and that she possessed the requisite qualifications for admission to the bar.A Question of Woman's Rights: An Application for Admission to the Bar, Hartford Courant, Mar. 25, 1882. The members agreed to allow Hall to be examined for the bar, subject to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Errors on its legality. Hall had many supporters nationwide who believed that her admission to the Bar would be important for women's suffrage. An editorial published in the Hartford Courant stated: \\"It is to be hoped that the members of the Hartford county bar will not see fit to put themselves on the illiberal side, on the pending application of an accomplished lady for admission to the bar. When women are allowed as teachers and as physicians without question, it would be taking a long step backward to refuse their admission to the bar. It would be regarded as a confession of fear on the part of men.\\"Mary Hall Scrapbook #4 (1882), Stowe Center Library, clipping. Another article stated, \\"Those very earnest and patient people of both sexes who advocate woman suffrage will look upon Miss Hall's success in getting a decision in her favor as an important contribution to the triumph of their cause.\\"Miss Attorney Hall, New York Times, September 27, 1882. In re Hall In May 1882, Thomas McManus submitted the brief in support of Hall in the case labeled In re Hall. He argued that \\"save sex,\\" there was no other reason why Hall should not be found to be qualified to be admitted to the Bar. Noting that women preached in churches, practiced medicine, taught in the classroom, and acted as executors, guardians, trustees, and overseers, he claimed that the language of the statute regulating attorneys \\"neither expressly [n]or impliedly exclude[d] women\\" and that \\"attorney\\" was defined as a \\"person.\\" Opposing counsel was Goodwin Collier, who argued that at the time the statute was enacted, women were excluded from the Bar and the legislature's failure to change the statute indicated its intent to continue to exclude women.Matthew G. Berger, Mary Hall: The Decision and the Lawyer, 79 Conn. Bar J. 29 (2005); Virginia G. Drachman, Sisters in Law: Women Lawyers in Modern American History 31 (1998). On July 19, 1882, the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors issued its decision in favor of Hall. Chief Justice John Park wrote for the Court and took the position, contrary to Collier's argument, that if the legislature wanted to exclude women, it would have rewritten the statute to expressly exclude them. Park explained his opinion, stating, \\"We are not to forget that all statutes are to be construed, as far as possible, in favor of equality of rights. All restrictions upon human liberty, all claims for special privileges, are to be regarded as having the presumption of law against them, and as standing upon their defense, and can be sustained, if at all by valid legislation, only by the clear expression or clear implication of the law.\\"In re Hall, 50 Conn. 131 (1882). This decision had the effect of holding that the laws of equal protection applied to women because he in effect rejected the \\"entire jurisprudence of separate spheres.\\"Virginia G. Drachman, Sisters in Law: Women Lawyers in Modern American History 31 (1998). It has been said that this decision as \\"[o]ne of the greatest decisions in all of Connecticut jurisprudence.\\"Wesley W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution: A Reference Guide 22 (1993). Later years During her legal career, Hall mostly confined herself to office work, assisting Hooker in preparing the Connecticut Reports and handling wills and property matters for women. Hall rarely appeared in court because \\"public sentiment would be much against a woman's speaking in court.\\"Virginia G. Drachman, Women Lawyers and the Origins of Professional Identity in America 136 (1993). In addition to her legal work, Hall became increasingly involved in suffrage and social reform activities. In March 1885, Hall helped to find the Hartford Woman Suffrage Club and served as its Vice President. She also attended the International Council of Women to celebrate the first Woman's Rights Convention, where the International Woman's Bar Association was founded. Hall was then elected Assistant Secretary at the Connecticut Woman's Suffrage Association convention. In 1895, Hall became a member of the State Board of Charities and was responsible for investigating and regulating the charitable institutions through the state. She also testified before the State Judiciary Committee in 1905 against a bill that would prohibit girls from selling newspapers. Mary Hall is remembered as a pioneer in the legal profession and a suffragist and reformist in Connecticut because of her dedication to the cause of women and of the welfare of underprivileged children.

Some Turkic cultures use this legend to describe their ethnic origins and the origin of the system of political clans used by Turkmen, Ottoman, and other Oghuz Turks. The various versions of the narrative preserved in many different manuscripts has been published in numerous languages as listed below in the references. The narrative is often entitled Oghuznama, or narrative of the Oghuz. The name of Oghuz Khan has been associated with Maodun. The reason for that is a remarkable similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turco-Persian tradition with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources, which was first noticed by Hyacinth.Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Compilation of reports on peoples inhabiting Central Asia in ancient times\\", vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851, pp. 56‚Äì57Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", transl., 1968, Vol. 1, p. 129 Sources The legend of Oghuz Khan is one of a number of different origin narratives that circulated among the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. It was first recorded in the 13th century. The anonymous Uyghur vertical script narrative of the 14th century, which is preserved in Paris, is a manuscript that was probably already being modified to fit with stories of the Mongol Conquest, as Paul Pelliot has shown and it does have suggestions of Oghuz Khan's later significance as Islamizer of the Turks, and does not include the figure of Moghul (Mongol) as an ancestor of Oghuz Khan. Oghuz Khan pictured with two horns as Zulqarnayn on a 100 Turkmenistan manat banknote. Ab≈´‚Äôl-GhƒÅzƒ´‚Äôs 17th century version called Shajara-i TarƒÅkima (Genealogy of the Turkmen) roughly follows Rashƒ´d ad-Dƒ´n‚Äôs already Mongolized (post-conquest) version of the early 14th century. But in his account, Oghuz Khan is more fully integrated into Islamic and Mongol traditional history. The account begins with descent from Adam to Noah, who after the flood sends his three sons to repopulate the earth: Ham was sent to Africa, Sam to Iran, and Yafes went to the banks of the Itil and Yaik rivers and had eight sons named Turk, Khazar, Saqlab, Rus, Ming, Chin, Kemeri, and Tarikh. As he was dying he established Turk as his successor. Turk settled at Issiq Kul and was succeeded by Tutek, the eldest of his four sons. Four generations after him came two sons, Tatar and Moghul, who divided his kingdom between them. Moghul Khan begat Qara Khan who begat Oghuz Khan. For three days he would not nurse and every night he appeared in his mother's dream and told his mother to become a Muslim or he would not suckle her breast. His mother converted, and Ab≈´‚Äôl-GhƒÅzƒ´ writes that the Turkic peoples of Yafes from the time of Qara Khan had been Muslim but had lost the faith. Oghuz Khan restored Islamic belief. =Seljuks= The Seljuks originated from the Kinik branch of the Oghuz Turks,Concise Britannica Online Seljuq Dynasty articleMerriam- Webster Online ‚Äì Definition of SeljukThe History of the Seljuq Turks: From the Jami Al-Tawarikh (LINK)Shaw, Stanford.

Sultan Cem, Bayezid II's brother, linked their geneaology to Oghuz Khagan that would prevail as a tool of legitimization of the sixteenth century onwards:Marinos Sariyannis, (2018), A History of Ottoman Political Thought Up to the Early Nineteenth Century, p. 61 > Oghuz Khan, he was given the name, which means \\"saint\\", in his childhood > because he was seen on the right path (i.e. God's). Because he recognized > the Oneness of God, he fought with his father, and Oghuz's army killed the > latter. This happened during Prophet Abraham's times. Legend Oguzhan monument in Ashgabat According to a Turkish legend, Oghuz was born in Central Asia as the son of Qara Khan, leader of the Turkic people. He started talking as soon as he was born. He stopped drinking his mother's milk after the first time and asked for kymyz (an alcoholic beverage made with fermented horse milk) and meat. After that, he grew up supernaturally fast and in only forty days he became a young adult. At the time of his birth, the lands of the Turkic people were preyed upon by a dragon named Kiyant. Oghuz armed himself and went to kill the dragon. He set a trap for the dragon by hanging a freshly killed deer in a tree, then killed the great dragon with a bronze lance and cut off its head with a steel sword. After Oghuz killed Kiyant, he became a people's hero. He formed a special warrior band from the forty sons of forty Turkic begs (lords, chiefs), thus gathering the clans together. But his Chinese stepmother and half-brother, who was the heir to the throne, became intimidated by his power and convinced Qara Khan that Oghuz was planning to dethrone him. Qara Khan decided to assassinate Oghuz at a hunting party. Oghuz learned about this plan and instead killed his father and became the khan. His stepmother and half-brother fled to Chinese lands. After Oghuz became the khan, he went to the steppes by himself to praise and pray to Tengri. While praying, he saw a circle of light coming from the sky with a supernaturally beautiful girl standing in the light. Oghuz fell in love with the girl and married her. He had three sons whom he named G√ºne≈ü (Sun), Ay (Moon), and Yƒ±ldƒ±z (Star) (all in Turkish). Later, Oghuz went hunting and saw another mesmerizing girl inside a tree. He married her as well and had three more sons whom he named G√∂k (Sky), Daƒü (Mountain), and Deniz (Sea) (in Turkish). After his sons were born, Oghuz Khan gave a great toy (feast) and invited all of his begs (lords). At the feast, he gave this order to his lords: > \\"I have become your Khan; > Let's all take swords and shields; > Kut (divine power) will be our sign; > Gray wolf will be our uran (battle cry); > Our iron lances will be a forest; > Khulan will walk on the hunting ground; > More seas and more rivers; > Sun is our flag and sky is our tent.\\" Then, he sent letters to the Kings of the Four Directions, saying: \\"I am the Khan of the Turks. And I will be Khan of the Four Corners of the Earth. I want your obedience.\\" Altun Khan (Golden Khan), on the right corner of the earth, submitted his obedience, but Urum (Roman), Khan of the left corner, did not. Oghuz declared war on Urum Khan and marched his army to the west. One night, a large male wolf with grey fur (which is an avatar of Tengri) came to his tent in an aura of light. He said, \\"Oghuz, you want to march against Urum, I want to march before your army.\\" So, the grey sky-wolf marched before the Turkic army and guided them. The two armies fought near the river ƒ∞til (Volga). Oghuz Khan won the battle. Then, Oghuz and his six sons carried out campaigns in Turkistan, India, Iran, Egypt, Iraq and Syria, with the grey wolf as their guide. He became the Khan of the Four Corners of the Earth. In his old age, Oghuz saw a dream. He called his six sons and sent them to the east and the west. His elder sons found a golden bow in the east. His younger sons found three silver arrows in the west. Oghuz Khan broke the golden bow into three pieces and gave each to his three older sons G√ºn, Ay, and Yƒ±ldƒ±z. He said, \\"My older sons, take this bow and shoot your arrows to the sky like this bow.\\" He gave the three silver arrows to his three younger sons G√∂k, Daƒü and Deniz and said, \\"My younger sons, take these silver arrows. A bow shoots arrows and you are to be like the arrow.\\" Then, he passed his lands on to his sons, Bozoks (Gray Arrows - elder sons) and √ú√ßoks (Three Arrows - younger sons) at a final banquet. (Ab≈´‚Äôl-GhƒÅzƒ´ identifies the lineage symbols, tamga seals and ongon spirit guiding birds, as well as specifying the political hierarchy and seating order at banquets for these sons and their 24 sons) Then he said: > \\"My sons, I walked a lot; > I saw many battles; > I threw so many arrows and lances; > I rode many horses; > I made my enemies cry; > I made my friends smile; > I paid my debt to Tengri; > Now I am giving my land to you.\\" Historical precursor and legacy Bust of Modun or (Mete Khan) In scientific literature, the name of Maodun is usually associated with Oguz Kagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people . The reason for that is a striking similarity of the Oguz-Kagan biography in the Turko-Persian manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Collection of information, pp. 56‚Äì57).Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Collection of information on peoples in Central Asia in ancient times\\", vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851, pp. 56-57Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", transl., 1968, Vol. 1, p. 129 Oghuz Khan is sometimes considered the legendary founder of all Turkic peoples, and ancestor of the Oghuz subbranch. Even today, subbranches of Oghuz are classified in order of the legendary six sons and 24 grandsons of Oghuz Khan. In history, Turkmen dynasties often rebelled or claimed sovereignty by saying their rank was higher than the existing dynasty in this tribal classification. Oƒüuz and Oƒüuzhan are a common masculine Turkish given names, which come from Oghuz Khan. Mary Province's district Oguzhan, in Turkmenistan, is named after him.

It was released on July 24, 2007 in five different editions, including three retailer-exclusive editions that each added a unique acoustic bonus track. Similarly to Another Journal Entry, this album was released in a special edition variant known as How Can We Be Silent Premium Edition. It was released concurrently with the regular edition, adding a new cover sleeve and bundling a 45-minute DVD. Video content includes personal interviews, stories behind the songs on the album and two previously released music videos, \\"I Need You to Love Me and \\"Never Alone\\". Marketing Alyssa Barlow sings in the lost \\"Sweet Revenge\\" music video. On May 20, 2007, Warner Music Group launched a promotional site, Have You Heard The Word?, to promote this album and other upcoming releases. Two music videos were announced, but cancelled, during the How Can We Be Silent era. The first was announced on May 24, 2007 on the How Can We Be Silent All Access Pass site intended for Family Christian Stores customers, without announcing the song for the music video. Additionally, the back of the All Access Pass mentions \\"the world premiere of the new BarlowGirl video and more!\\" However, no such premiere occurred and the music video release was ultimately cancelled. The second music video, \\"Sweet Revenge\\", was recorded in 2009 by 1834 Productions as part of a Deep Forgiveness devotional. A promotional video features a very short clip of Alyssa Barlow in the music video, as she is mouthing: \\"'til you feel this pain too.\\" However, the song cannot be heard, as the audio uses a promotional narrator. This music video is lost, as it was omitted from Deep Forgiveness. Critical reception How Can We Be Silent received generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was less impressed, giving the album 2¬Ω out of 5 stars for its \\"gothic textures\\" and its \\"noisy, cluttered multi-segmented songs.\\" Similarly, David Sessions from Patrol Magazine gave the album a 4.7 out of 10 rating, calling it \\"an unvaried ruckus sustained for 50 minutes\\". The album's sound was likened to that of Evanescence. Track listing *Alyssa Barlow and Lauren Barlow share lead vocals in the band.

He also decided the case of Cantor Fitzgerald v Tradition UK, where he explained that the 3,000 out of 77,000 lines of copied source code by Tradition's programmers would be substantial, it not being important to substantiality what use the program made out of the code, i.e. whether it could function without it or not, but it would be a substantial if the part taken was original. He further ruled in Sandman v Panasonic that a single create effort could result in both a literary and artistic copyright, giving the example of a calligraphic poem of a cat.

NGF provides golf-business research and consulting services. its original mission was to publish authoritative research useful to investors developing the game of golf. it had 6000 member companies. The NGF is based in Jupiter, FL. For the past 30 years, it has been led by President and CEO, Dr. Joseph Beditz, who reports to the board of directors. They still continue to be the Foundation's intentions: following the industry data and trends, and consulting for golf facility development and operations.  History  The National Golf Foundation (NGF) is a 501(c)6 nonprofit trade association that was founded in 1936 by journalists Herb Graffis and his brother Joe. They wanted to provide a resource to promote the game of golf. Golf began a slow decline due to the stock market crash of 1929. Even with grown in the nation, golf still fell. During the first years of the foundation, the Graffis brothers reached out for financial help. Six of the game's leading equipment manufacturers gave $17,000 to the NGF in support of what NGF wanted to accomplish. NGF began their mission with a book, (How to Build a Golf Course). The book brought to light golf course construction and the record of all of the nation's golf courses. These books helped achieve brand recognition within the golf community as a top research foundation. Next, the NGF worked with towns and local governments to develop the concept of public golf courses. These began popping up in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s the NGF began facilitating more competent golf instructors and classes. These methods were wonderful starting tools, like videos, to introduce the game of golf to new players. The National Golf Foundation took a major role within the golfing business community in 1981. They brought together the first industry-wide ‚ÄúForum for Golf‚Äù in Dallas, Texas. Players and businesses began to view the NGF as an overall company to assist in many golfing needs. They are able to help out in many different parts of the industry: retail, media, apparel, software technology, private and commercialized courses, financial local to national scale. Today, the NGF is trusted by the most important businesses and organizations in golf as the foremost authority of accurate and objective measures of the game's vitality. Golf companies from every sector rely on the NGF's data, research, reports and insights to keep them informed on overall industry trends, with expertise delivered by the world's largest research staff dedicated to the golf business. Additionally, NGF Consulting, Inc., a for-profit subsidiary formed in 1989, provides one-on-one proprietary services to help clients become more successful in an ever-changing business environment.  Present  Today, NGF is a renounced company supported by some of the biggest companies throughout the golf community. They are trusted in providing the most accurate and objective measures of the game's vitality. Every year the NGF releases the Golf Industry Report. This is an annual research report that integrates all of the key data points to help assess golf's health and vitality. With a little more than one third of the United States population have played, watched or read about golf last year, the Golf Industry Report is very important. The golf industry drove in huge numbers in the United States back in 2016, $84.1 billion in economic activity. This shows an increase of 22.1 percent from years prior.

From the age of five Basil studied astronomical texts that he had inherited from his grandfather. He later attended Rickinghall School and also received some private tutoring. From an early age he could be found digging up fields. At 12 years old he left school to work on his father's farm. By attending evening classes, Brown earned a certificate in drawing in 1902. In 1907 he obtained diplomas with distinction for astronomy, geography and geology through studies with the Harmsworth Self-Educator correspondence college. Using text books and radio broadcasts Brown taught himself Latin and learnt to speak French fluently, while also acquiring some knowledge of Greek, German and Spanish. Although declared medically unfit for war service at the outbreak of World War I, Brown served as a volunteer in the Suffolk Royal Army Medical Corps from 16 October 1918 to 31 October 1919. On 27 June 1923 Brown married Dorothy May Oldfield (1897-1983), a domestic servant, and daughter of Robert John Oldfield, who worked as head carpenter on the Wramplingham estate. Basil and May lived and worked on his father's farm even after George Brown had died, with May assuming responsibility for a dairy. They struggled to make a living, partly through Brown's preoccupation with astronomy, and partly due to how small the farm was. By 1934 the smallholding had become so unviable that Brown gave it up. He supplemented odd jobs by becoming a special police constable. In August 1935 he and May rented a cottage named Cambria in The Street, Rickinghall, where they lived until their deaths, having purchased it in the 1950s.  Astronomical work  After the death of his mother, Brown and May lived for a short time in a school house, where he completed Astronomical Atlases, Maps and Charts: An Historical and General Guide, which he had started writing in 1928 and which was published in 1932. Brown was nominated as a member of the British Astronomical Association in 1918,According to Plunkett, Brown joined the British Astronomical Association in July 1918, while the Orwell Astronomical Society records the date of his nomination as November 1918 and remained a member until financial straits forced him in 1934 to let his membership lapse. In 1924 he published articles on astronomical mapping and cataloguing in the independent publication The English Mechanic and World of Science, followed in 1932 by an article on Stephen Groombridge in the journal of the Astronomical Association. Brown's Astronomical Atlases was sufficiently popular to be reprinted in 1968, with his publisher describing it as \\" 'filling an inexplicable gap in the literature' \\".  Early archeological career  In his spare time Brown continued to investigate the countryside in north Suffolk for Roman remains. Intrigued by the alignment of ancient sites, he used a compass and measurements to uncover eight medieval buildings (one at Burgate, where his father had been born), identified Roman settlements, and traced ancient roads. His investigations of Roman industrial potteries led in 1934 to the discovery, excavation and successful removal to Ipswich Museum in 1935 of a Roman kiln at Wattisfield. In this way Brown got to know Guy Maynard, curator of the Museum (1920 to 1952) and H. A. Harris, secretary of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology. He applied to Maynard to work for the museum on a contractual basis. His first contract with the Museum and the Suffolk Institute was for thirteen weeks of work in 1935 at Stuston and at Stanton Chare at ¬£2 per week. At the latter site Brown discovered a Roman villa, leading to excavations that extended to three seasons of about thirty weeks in 1936-38 (until 1939, according to Maynard). Archaeological work started to provide a semi-regular income for him, but at a lower wage of ¬£1 10 shillingsBefore 1971, twenty shillings made a pound; so Brown's salary decreased from 40 shillings per week at Stanton to a regular salary of 30 shillings per week. per week, so that he had to continue working as an insurance agent and a special constable. helmet discovered by Brown's excavations in East Anglia  Sutton Hoo excavations  Landowner Edith May Pretty JP (1883-1942) were curious about the contents of about eighteen ancient mounds on her Sutton Hoo estate in southeast Suffolk. At a 1937 fete in nearby Woodbridge Pretty discussed the possibility of opening them with Vincent B. Redstone, member of several historical and archaeological societies. Redstone invited the curator of the Ipswich Corporation Museum, Guy Maynard, to a meeting with Pretty in July 1937, and Maynard offered the services of Brown as excavator. Sutton Hoo farm derives its name in part from the surrounding parish of Sutton and its village, where 77 households lived by 1086. Sutton is a compound noun formed from the Old English 'sut' (south) and 'tun' (enclosed settlement or farm). The farm and its mounds have been recorded on maps since at least 1601, when John Norden included it in his survey of Sir Michael Stanhope's estates between Woodbridge and Aldeburgh. The land was known variously as \\"Hows\\", \\"Hough\\", \\"Howe\\", and eventually \\"Hoo Farm\\" by the 19th century (ca. 1834-65). \\"Hoo\\" likely means a \\"hill\\" - an elevated place shaped like a heel, from the Old English \\"h√≥h\\" or \\"h√≥\\" (similar to the German \\"hohe\\"), which is sometimes associated with a burial site. = June‚ÄìAugust 1938 = Maynard released Brown from his employment by Ipswich Museum for June‚ÄìAugust 1938, during which he was paid 30 shillings a week by Pretty. Arriving on 20 June, Brown was lodged for the duration with Pretty's chauffeur. He brought along books spanning the Bronze Age to the Anglo-Saxon period and some excavation reports. Given the proposed time limit of two weeks, Brown decided to copy the cross-trench digging methods used in 1934 excavations of Iron Age mounds at Warborough Hill in Norfolk, where similar time constraints had applied.Brown writes in his diary about excavation techniques employed by \\"Norfolk and Norwich Archaeological Society, vol. 25, pp. 408-28\\" - a reference to R.R. Clarke and H. Apling (1935)'s An Iron Age Tumulus on Warborough Hill, Stiffkey, Norfolk. See also Carver 1998, p. 186, note 5.) With the help of Pretty's labourers, Brown excavated three mounds, discovering that they were burial sites showing signs of robbery during the medieval period. Sutton Hoo map, highlighting in red the mounds opened by Brown between 1938 and 1939. Brown first tackled what was later identified as Mound 3. Initially he found nothing, but evidence suggested a bowl-shaped area had been dug below. Following Maynard's recommendation Brown removed the soil and found a \\"grave deposit\\", off-set from the mound's center. Its location resulted perhaps from the shape of the mound distorting over time, or from the removal of some of its material. Early Saxon pottery was found, laying on a narrow 6-foot long wooden tray-like object - \\"a mere film of rotted wood fibers\\", plus an iron axe that Maynard later considered to be Viking (‚ÄùScandinavian\\"). Pretty decided to open other mounds, and two were chosen. In what was later known as Mound 2, Brown used the east‚Äìwest compass-bearing of the excavated board found in Mound 3 to align a 6-foot wide trench. From outside the mound's perimeter he begun digging along the old ground surface towards the mound on 7 July. A ship's rivet was discovered, along with Bronze Age pottery shards and a bead. On 11 July Brown found more ship's rivets, and asked Ipswich Museum to forward material on the Snape ship burial which was excavated in 1862‚Äì63. Pretty wrote to make an appointment for Brown with the curator of Aldeburgh Museum, where artifacts from the Snape excavation were housed. Maynard forwarded a drawing which arrived on 15 July and showed the pattern of the Snape boat's rivets. On 20 July Brown was driven to Aldeburgh by Pretty's chauffeur,This version of events is from Brown's diary, which contradicts accounts (e.g. Weatherly's) that he stopped excavating completely before cycling some 15 miles to Aldeburgh museum. where he found the Sutton Hoo rivet to be very similar to those from Snape. Back at Sutton Hoo, the shape of a boat with only one pointed end was uncovered. It seemed to have been cut in half, with one half possibly used as a cover over the other half. Evidence suggested that the site had been looted, as the upper half was missing. Signs of a cremation were found, along with a gold-plated shield boss and glass fragments. Brown excavated what was later called Mound 4, which he found to have been completely emptied of archaeological evidence by robbers. In August 1938 Brown went back to work for the Ipswich Museum, returning to the dig at Stanton Chare. Meanwhile, Maynard wrote to Manx Museum to find out more about ship burials. = May‚ÄìAugust 1939 = At Maynard's request, due to his curiosity about the axe, Brown returned to the employment of Pretty for a second season. On 8 May 1939 he started to excavate Mound 1, the largest mound, assisted on Pretty's instructions by gardener John Jacobs and gamekeeper William Spooner. As before, Brown used the compass bearing uncovered in the end mound to start a narrow pilot trench outside the mound. On 11 May he discovered iron rivets that were similar but bigger than those found in the 2nd mound, suggesting an even larger sailing vessel than the boat found earlier. Brown cycled to Ipswich to report the find to Maynard, who advised him to proceed with care in uncovering the impression of the ship and its rivets. Brown not only uncovered the impression left in the sandy soil by a 27-meter-long ship from the 7th century AD, but evidence of robbers who had stopped before they had reached the level of a burial deposit. Based on knowledge of ship burials in Norway, Brown and Maynard surmised that a roof had covered the burial chamber. Realizing the potential enormity of the find, Maynard recommended to Pretty that they involve the British Museum's Department of British Antiquities. Pretty demurred at the possible indefinite suspension of excavation that might result, but neither Brown or Maynard were willing to continue. Maynard thought that the boat was a cenotaph, as no evidence of a body was found, a position that he still retained by 1963. Basil Brown (front) and Lt. Cmdr. J.K.D. Hutchison excavating the 7th century burial ship at Sutton Hoo in 1939. Charles Phillips, Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge, heard rumours about the dig during a visit to his university's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Downing Street, Cambridge, and of the inquiries made of the Manx Museum about Viking ship burials. He arranged to meet with Maynard and they drove to Sutton Hoo from Ipswich on 6 June to visit the site. Phillips suggested that the British Museum and the Ancient Monuments Department of the Ministry of Works should be telephoned and informed. A meeting convened at Sutton Hoo by representatives of the British Museum, the Office of Works, Cambridge University, Ipswich Museum, and the Suffolk Institute three days later, gave Phillips control over excavations, starting in July. Brown was allowed to continue, and uncovered the burial chamber on 14 June, followed later by the ship's stern. In 1940 Thomas Kendrick (Keeper, Department of British and Medieval Antiquities in the British Museum) suggested that the burial site was that of Raedwald of East Anglia. Having ensconced himself in the Bull Hotel at Woodbridge on 8 July, Phillips took charge of the excavations on 11 July. Employed by the Office of Works, he convened a team that included W.F. Grimes, O.G.S. Crawford, Stuart and Peggy Piggot. On 21 July Peggy Piggot discovered the first signs of what later turned out to be 263 items. Phillips and Maynard had differences of opinion, leading Phillips to exclude the Ipswich Museum. The press had come to learn of the significance of the find by 28 July. Brown continued to work on the site in accordance with his contract with Pretty, although excluded from excavating the burial chamber that he had located. On 14 August Brown testified at a treasure trove inquest which decided that the finds, transported to London for safekeeping due to the threat of war and concealed underground at Aldwych tube station, belonged to Pretty. Working with a farm labourer Brown took care to cover the excavated ship site with hessian and bracken. Brown returned again to his work at Stanton Chare in late 1939. After Sutton Hoo Suffolk sites where Brown conducted excavations between 1935 and 1968. During World War II Brown performed a few archaeological tasks for the Museum, but was principally engaged in civil defense work in Suffolk. He served in the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes and in the Royal Observer Corps post at Micklewood Green.Micklewood Green may refer to an older name for Botesdale Green (see reference in Peggy Healey, 1924‚Äî2012) . After the war Brown was again employed by the Museum, nominally as an 'attendant', but with archaeological, external duties. He joined the Ipswich and District Natural History Society and then the District Astronomical Society (1950-1957) when it broke away from its parent body. In 1952 he undertook excavations in Rickinghall that uncovered a long-since disappeared Lady Chapel at the Superior Church and a Norman font at the Inferior Church. Until the 1960s he steadily continued the systematic study of archaeological remains in Suffolk, cycling everywhere, and preparing an extremely copious (if sometimes indecipherable) record of information pertaining to it. In 1961 Brown retired from Ipswich Museum, but continued to conduct excavations at Broom Hills in Rickinghall between 1964 and 1968. He uncovered evidence of a Neolithic presence, Roman occupation and the site of a Saxon nobleman's house. Death During the Broom Hills excavations, Brown suffered either a stroke or a heart attack in 1965, which ended his active involvement in archeological digs. He died on 12 March 1977 of pneumonia at his home \\"Cambria\\" in Rickinghall and was cremated at Ipswich crematorium on 17 March. Legacy and assessment The regard in which Brown was held is evident from the efforts made by members of the Suffolk Institute to provide him with a pension. The Sutton Hoo scholar Rupert Bruce-Mitford ensured that Brown was awarded a civil-list pension of ¬£250- in 1966. While he never published material on his archeological work as a sole author, his meticulously kept notebooks, including photographs, plans and drawings are now kept by the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service and Ipswich Records Office. Out of this was developed the County Sites and Monuments Record of Suffolk, the basis of the record as it exists today. He encouraged groups of children to work on his sites, and introduced a whole generation of youngsters to the processes of archaeology and the fascination of what lay under the ploughed fields of the county. Brown's contributions to archaeology were recognized in 2009 by a plaque in Rickinghall Inferior Church. Yet he continues to be largely unacknowledged for his work at Sutton Hoo. The plaque attests to his esteem among Suffolk archeologists, historians, and locals. The items found at Sutton Hoo as a result of his initial excavations continue to be studied through current scientific methods from time to time at the British Museum - most recently, yielding additional insights into the origin of bitumen found among the grave goods. The annual Basil Brown Memorial Lecture in his name was established by the Sutton Hoo Society, which supports research at the site of Brown's greatest discovery. A street in Rickinghall, the village where Brown lived, was named Basil Brown Close. Bibliography * Brown, B. (1924). \\"Star Atlases and Charts\\".

Aside from its literary use, the ellipsis has a counterpart in film production. It is there to suggest an action by simply showing what happens before and after what is observed. The vast majority of films use ellipses to clear actions that add nothing to the narrative. Beyond these \\"convenience\\" ellipses, ellipses are also used to advance the story. Description An ellipsis in narrative leaves out a portion of the story. This can be used to condense time, or as a stylistic method to allow the reader to fill in the missing portions of the narrative with their imagination. Ellipsis was also used in literature, as in the modernist works of Ernest Hemingway who pioneered the Iceberg Theory, also known as the theory of omission. Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse contains famous examples of literary ellipses. Between the first and second parts of the novel, many years pass and World War I is fought and won. The reader is left to infer the events that have taken place during the elapsed time by the changes evident in the characters in the novel. Another example is found in Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence. Ellipsis is a common procedure in film narrative, where movement and action unnecessary to the telling of a story will often be removed by editing. For example, there would be no need to show a character standing up from a chair and walking the length of a room to open a door. Instead, the character may be shown standing up from the chair and then in the next cut‚Äînormally viewed from a different angle, or with a cutaway shot in between, necessary to smooth over the gap‚Äîhe would have already crossed the room and be over by the door. Narrative logic allows the viewer to disregard the ellipsis in this case. At the start of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), for example, a giant chronological leap is taken as the narrative jumps from the first technology of humankind, a bone club, to a spacecraft flying through space in the year 2001.See Alexander Walker's book Stanley Kubrick, Director p. 181‚Äì182. This is the 2000 edition. The 1971 edition is titled \\"Stanley Kubrick Directs\\" In this instance, however, the ellipsis ‚Äì a match cut in film language ‚Äì is filled by the metaphorical parallelism between the two objects, visually similar in shape and joined by a deep anthropological significance. The Japanese director Yasujir≈ç Ozu is also famous for his use of ellipsis. Important people or events would be omitted in his narration, leaving what has happened evident to audiences only through subsequent dialogue. For example, in Late Spring (1949), Noriko is shown about to leave for her wedding in her kimono, while the next scene shows Mr. Somiya in a bar after the wedding.

This family went to live in Spain and remained faithful to the Spanish Habsburgs even after the Portuguese revolution of 1 December 1640, so the new Dynasty of Braganza no longer recognized them as Counts of Linhares.

He was first elected to the state House in 2010 to succeed fellow Republican Frank Corte Jr. Background Larson was reared on a family farm at Thousand Oaks and Jones- Maltsberger Road; the location is now heavily urbanized. When his parents divorced, he lived with his father, a large-animal veterinarian. He has a twin sister and a total of four siblings. His sisters went to live with their mother when the parents' marriage ended, and he was hence separated from his twin. While working on the farm, Larson contracted paratyphoid from handling feed for hogs and not washing his hands before eating. He lost weight and remained thin during his time playing defensive end in football at Douglas MacArthur High School in the North East Independent School District in Bexar County, from which he graduated in 1977. In 1981, he obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Texas A&M; University in College Station, where Larson's father had obtained his veterinary degree. He married and divorced right out of college. Prior to starting his own company, American Consortium, which distributes industrial products for Polaroid, he worked for Nalen Chemical Company and Johnson & Johnson.Peggy Fikac, \\"S.A. Rep. Larson is not scared by any governor,\\" San Antonio Express-News, August 6, 2017, pp. 1, A23. Larson is a member of the United Methodist Church. He is a quail hunter and bass fisherman. San Antonio International Ag Promotions, which he founded, hosts such trade expositions as the San Antonio International Farm and Ranch Show and the Texas Hunting and Outdoor Classic. He takes an annual fishing trip to Lake Michigan with friends from high school and college. Political life Larson was elected on a nonpartisan ballot in 1991 to the San Antonio City Council, on which he served from District 10 for two two-year terms under Mayor Nelson Wolff. In 1996, he was elected to the Bexar County commissioner's court for Precinct 3, a partisan position that he filled from 1997 to 2008. There are only three other commissioners and the county judge. While on the commissioners court as the lone Republican member, Larson worked to lower property tax rates seven times during his twelve years in office. In 2005, he pushed the court to freeze property taxes for senior citizens and the disabled. He opposed pay raises for commissioners and refused to accept increases when they were approved. Larson worked to reduce the impact of the 2005 round of military base closings in San Antonio, which gained a reported 11,000 jobs despite the loss of 1,000 positions on the affected bases. Larson previously served on the San Antonio - Bexar County Metropolitan Planning Organization, the Alamo Area Council of Governments, and the Greater San Antonio Crime Commission. In 2008, Larson ran unsuccessfully for Texas' 23rd congressional district seat once held by the Republican Henry Bonilla of San Antonio. In the Republican primary election, Larson defeated attorney and banker Quico Canseco, formerly of Laredo, Texas. Larson then lost in the general election to incumbent Democrat Ciro Rodriguez of San Antonio in the Hispanic-majority district. The vote was 55.8 percent for Rodriguez and 41.9 percent for Larson, with the remaining ballots held by a Libertarian candidate. In 2010, Rodriguez was unseated by Canseco, who won the Republican nomination that year, but Canseco served only for one term, having been defeated in 2012 by another Democrat, Pete Gallego, a state legislator from Alpine, Texas. Gallego lost the seat in 2014 to the African-American Republican Will Hurd. In 2010, Larson was elected state representative; he polled 56,702 votes (77.4 percent) to 16,576 (22.6 percent) for the Democrat Masarrat Ali. His total of nearly 57,000 votes was the greatest number of ballots polled by any candidate for state representative in the entire state of Texas that year. The runner-up, Republican Rob Eissler in District 15, received 52,550 votes. Larson is a member of the Texas House committees on (1) Natural Resource, (2) Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, and (3) Local and Consent Calendars. In his freshman year he was elected by the Texas Tribune as one of three \\"Rookies of the Year\\" of a class of thirty-seven new members. Larson was unopposed for a second term in the House in 2012. Larson is personally and politically close to House Speaker Joe Straus, also of San Antonio. The two men are the same age, and their family connections go back for four decades. Larson's father provided care for the horses and cattle on the Straus farms. But Larson said in an interview that \\"sometimes\\" Straus \\"doesn't quite understand me.\\" After the 2017 regular session of the legislature, Governor Greg Abbott vetoed five of Larson's bills, including measures dealing with brackish water and desalination efforts. Another Larson measure which would have prevented a governor from appointing members to a state board or commission if the nominee had donated $2,500 or more to the governor's previous campaign passed the House, 91-48, but it received no hearing in the Texas State Senate. Another Larson bill which would ensured that a parent has the right to view the body of a deceased child before the performance of an autopsy was vetoed because Abbott said that he had already signed a measure with identical language authored by Republican State Senator Donna Campbell of New Braunfels. Larson said that he believes Abbott \\"lacks maturity [and] can't separate policy and politics.\\"Mike Ward and Peggy Fikac, \\"Abbott veto tally highest since '07: Larson, who saw five bills axed, cites retribution,\\" San Antonio Express-News, June 16, 2017, p. A3. On the eve of the special legislative session of 2017, Larson continued to express frustration with Governor Abbott: \\"The reality is, since the governor skipped class for four months, we've got ... summer school with him now to help him learn what we did.\\"Peggy Fikac, \\"Curtain is rising on Act iI in Austin: Reputations are on the line in this Legislature drama,\\" San Antonio Express- News, July 16, 2017, p. 1. Larson said that he is unlikely to serve in the state House much past 2020: \\"My ambitions are just to try to do the right thing. ... And then leave everything on the field, then walk away.\\" Despite his squabbles with Governor Abbott, Larson won re-nomination over a conservative intra-party challenger, Mayor Christopher Michael \\"Chris\\" Fails of Hollywood Park in Bexar County. On November 6, 2018, he was reelected with 58,062 votes (62 percent) to 35,577 ballots (38 percent) for his Democratic opponent, Claire Barnett. Ethics controversy Larson caused controversy within his own party after accusing Governor Abbott of quid pro quo, or \\"pay for play\\", politics. According to Larson, people \\"have to pay large sums of money\\" http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Lawmakers-press-Gov- Abbott-on-ethics-his-office-11728284.php for state seats. However, opponents of Larson's comments were quick to cite the fact that Abbott has appointed 21 people from HD 122 (Larson's District) to positions on boards, including Larson himself who was named to the Southwestern States Water Commission. Of these 21 people, none of them gave more than $5000. http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/Lawmakers-press-Gov-Abbott-on- ethics-his-office-11728284.php Greg Abbott himself was quick to respond saying, \\"Mr. Larson's fabricated comments are an embarrassment for someone who claims to be a champion of ethics reform.

If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds. For pilots, knowledge of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help determine whether or not various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with scalloped lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern.Glossary of Meteorology (2009). Nephanalysis. American Meteorological Society. Retrieved on 2008-01-22. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.AEROGRAPHER'S MATE 1&C; (2008).

Cloud types cumulus congestus not shown) Above or below the circle for manned stations (automatic stations do not report cloud types) that indicates sky cover can lie one or more symbols indicating cloud types in any of the low, middle, and high-√©tages for tropospheric clouds. One predominant cloud type may be depicted for each of three √©tages, if known. The middle and high-√©tage types are depicted above the sky cover circle of the station model, while the main low-√©tage cloud type is indicated below the circle. Since the station model has limited room, it makes no special provision for vertical or multi-level clouds that can occupy more than one √©tage at a particular time. Consequently, cloud genera with significant vertical development may be coded and plotted as low or middle depending on the altitude at which they normally form. Cumulus and cumulonimbus usually form in the low √©tage of the troposphere and achieve vertical extent by growing upward into the middle or high √©tage. Conversely, nimbostratus usually forms in the middle √©tage of the troposphere and becomes vertically developed by growing downward into the low √©tage. Although the SYNOP code has no separate formal group classification for vertical or multi- level clouds, the observer procedure for selecting numerical codes is designed to give high reporting priority to those genera or species that show significant vertical development. The symbols used for clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is indicated by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid on top of the cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When there is more than one cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included.JetStream (2003). Cloud type priority via Internet Wayback Machine. National Weather Service Southern Region Headquarters. Retrieved on 2007-05-17. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.

The present weather symbol depicts the current weather which normally is obstructing the visibility at the time of observation. The visibility itself is shown as a number, in statute miles in the United States and meters elsewhere, describing how far the observer can see at that time. This number is located to the left of the present weather symbol. For pilots, knowledge of the horizontal visibility helps determine if they are flying through instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as foggy or smoky conditions, as well as areas of intense precipitation. Present weather depicted with the station model can include: * Dust * Fog * Haze * Ocean spray * Precipitation * Sand * Smoke * Thunderstorms * Volcanic ash Temperature and dew point To left of center in the station model, the temperature and dew point are plotted. Within the United States on surface weather maps, they are still plotted in degrees Fahrenheit. Otherwise, they will be in units of degrees Celsius. This knowledge is important to meteorologists because when this data is plotted on a map, isotherms and isodrosotherms (lines of equal dew point) are easily analyzed, either by man or machine, which can help determine location of weather fronts. Sea level pressure and height of pressure surface On the top right corner of the model for a surface weather map is the pressure, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7 hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.American Meteorological Society (2006). Map Symbols. Retrieved on 2008-01-22. Pressure tendency Pressure tendency figures Below the pressure will lie the pressure tendency figure, which indicates the pressure change over the past three hours. The number depicting the pressure change will usually have two digits and indicate the pressure change in 0.1 millibar increments. There are nine different figures which represent the pressure change. A slant angled up and right indicates a steady rise, while a downward slant to the lower right indicates a steady fall. Steady rises can indicate improving conditions and approaching high pressure, and normally occur in the wake of a cold front. Steady falls can indicate deteriorating conditions and an approaching low pressure area, with the largest falls occurring in advance of a surface cyclone and its attendant warm front.University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences (1996). Air Masses and Fronts. Retrieved on 2008-01-22. The time of the day must be considered, as there are two natural rises per day (locally around 10 am and 10 pm) and two natural falls per day (locally around 4 am and 4 pm). These daily changes in pressure can mask the movement of pressure systems and fronts past a location. The lowest natural dip in the pressure, in a stagnant weather pattern, occurs around 4 pm while the highest natural peak in pressure occurs around 10 am.Frank Singleton (2000). Tides in the Atmosphere. Retrieved on 2007-05-16. Once plotted on a map, the analysis of isallobars (lines of equal pressure change) can be plotted on a map, which can indicate the direction of motion of high and low pressures systems across the map domain.Dr P. M. Inness. Isobaric analysis and pressure tendency. Dr. Giles Harrison. Retrieved on 2008-01-22. Past weather symbols Past weather Station models can have past weather plotted within them, which would be located just under the pressure tendency. They indicate the type of weather experienced during the past six hours. The weather types are limited to obstructions of visibility and precipitation. Animations may depict a time series of station model conditions which is most often used to show recent changes in weather conditions and are useful in nowcasting and forecasting.

She has held a number of cabinet positions in the Welsh Government. In December 2009 she was appointed Deputy Minister for Science, Innovation and Skills. In 2011, she was appointed Minister for Health and Social Services. She was then appointed Minister for Local Government and Government Business in March 2013. In September 2014 she was appointed Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty.

However, in 2003 Marek was de- selected by the local party and Griffiths was selected in his place. There followed a Labour Party inquiry, in which Marek was first contacted by telephone half an hour before the result was announced, and his de-selection was upheld. Marek then decided to fight to retain his seat as an Independent,Martin Shipton, \\"Marek likely to stand as independent\\", Western Mail, 12 March 2003. and Griffiths struggled during the campaign; an early poll showed Marek beating her by 40% to 29%.Kirsty Buchanan, \\"Marek beating Labour\\", Western Mail, 11 April 2003. In the event, on polling day Marek beat Griffiths by 973 votes. Subsequent elections Having been a supporter of Wrexham Football Club, Griffiths was elected to the board of the Wrexham Supporters Trust. In December 2005 she was selected again as Labour candidate for the Wrexham constituency for the 2007 Assembly elections. She benefited from high-profile support as the party saw an opportunity to recapture the seat; John Marek appealed to the large Polish immigrant population by translating his election material into Polish.Allegra Stratton, \\"'Glosuj na mnie!'\\", New Statesman, 30 April 2007. However, Griffiths increased her numerical vote while Marek's vote fell, and she won the seat by 1,250. In 2011, Griffiths faced Marek for a third time, though by now Marek had joined the Conservatives. Both of them saw increases in their votes compared to 2007, but Griffiths held the seat with an increased majority of 3,337. Griffiths was re-selected to defend her seat at the 2016 election., and retained it with reduced majority of 1,325 over the Conservative candidate.

He attended Massachusetts College of Art in 1964. In 1966 he moved to New York City where he currently resides. His painting style was described by the art critic Marcia Tucker in 1978 as Bad Painting, a description which he has embraced. Jenney describes his style as realism, but it is an idiosyncratic use of the word on his part, meaning: a style in which narrative truths are found in the simple relationships of objects. His body of work during 1969‚Äì1970, which is the period for which he was first known, was a reaction to minimalism and photo- realism. The work's impact was large for such a brief period: according to New York Times art critic Roberta Smith \\"in those two years Mr. Jenney helped put representational painting on a new course and established precedents for the art of the 1970s, 80s and 90s.\\" Often, Jenney's work of this period depicted pairs of objects which had evocative cause and effect relationships (such as a saw and a piece of cut wood, as are depicted in the 1969 piece Sawn and Saw.) In an April 15, 2001 review in the New York Observer of his show of work from the late 60s and early 70s at Gagosian Gallery, Mario Naves said that the paintings: > \\"...aren't really bad at least not bad bad. That pejorative adjective, in > Mr. Jenney's case, comes with scare quotes a mile high and connotes an art > that combines the dead-end figuration of Pop, the dead-end materiality of > Minimalism and a sense of humor that is, if not dead-end, then sharply > deadpan. Mr. Jenney painted the pictures during the heyday of Conceptual > Art, and if they were, in part, a rebuff to its disembodied verities, they > also partook of its intellectual detachment.\\" His painting Here and There (1969), which depicts a white fence dividing a field of drippy, green brushstrokes, was in the 2004 exhibition The Undiscovered Country at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. His work is in many museums including the Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

Railway locomotives  The first locomotive with a deliberate dome added to the boiler barrel was Stephenson's Rocket, although this was so small as to have little effect against priming. Many other locomotives built shortly after this date instead used either the 'haycock' boiler, where the firebox outer casing was raised high above the main part of the boiler, forming a steam dome, or Gooch's development of this where the semi-cylindrical firebox wrapper was raised above the boiler barrel. The most vigorous boiling in a locomotive boiler takes place around the hottest part, the firebox. This was a drawback to the haycock arrangement, and led to the general adoption of the separate dome instead. The dome is placed forward of the firebox, in an area of less vigorous boiling and thus fewer suspended water droplets. = Dome position = From the 1840s, boiler barrels were constructed from hoops of rolled iron, or later steel, sheet. As boilers were longer than the width of the available iron sheet, two or three hoops were required. For strength, the dome was always placed in the centre of a hoop, rather than spanning a joint. Early boilers used narrow plates and thus had a centrally located dome, in the centre of the middle hoop. Later boilers could use the wider plates then available and used two hoops, so as to reduce the number of riveted joints. These domes were thus placed at a quarter of the barrel's length (from the front of the firebox wrapper). File:Ahrons (1921) Steam Locomotive Construction and Maintenance Fig07.jpgBoiler made of three hoops, with the dome placed centrally File:GER F48 0-6-0 locomotive, 1189 (Howden, Boys' Book of Locomotives, 1907).jpgGreat Eastern F48 0-6-0, with a two-hoop boiler barrel and thus the dome moved rearwards File:GNR 8 foot single locomotive 1 (Howden, Boys' Book of Locomotives, 1907).jpgGNR Stirling 4-2-2 locomotive with domeless boiler =Domeless boilers= Some locomotive designers in Britain continued to use domeless boilers even after the use of steam domes became commonplace. The square-topped Belpaire firebox allows steam to be conveniently collected at its top corners and therefore locomotives with Belpaire fireboxes often dispensed with a dome, for example express engines such as the GWR Castle Class (the large brass boiler fitting on a Castle is the distinctive GWR safety valve cover, not a dome). Ultimately, the restrictive British loading gauge was a major factor which determined the size of the dome, with large-boilered express locomotives, such as the LNER Class A1, only having space for a very shallow dome.  Traction engines  1:2 model of a Burrell single-crank compound traction engine. Note the Ramsbottom safety valve mounted on top. Traction engines in Britain were rarely fitted with a steam dome. As their cylinder block was mounted directly onto the top of the boiler barrel, the casting for this was cast with a large steam jacket around the cylinder(s). This jacket was large and tall enough to act as a steam dome. The base of the cylinder casting was a curved saddle to fit directly onto the boiler. Holes drilled in the boiler allowed steam to pass through, usually more than one smaller hole, to avoid reducing the boiler strength. The passages of the steam jacket were large enough that the safety valve could also be mounted on the cylinder block. The regulator could also conveniently be built into the casting, immediately between the dome passage and the valve chest, without requiring long steam pipes. US traction engines were commonly fitted with domes, as were the British-built Howard engines.  Stationary and marine boilers  Cornish boiler, with a 'Dolly Varden' dome Most designs of stationary boilers did not generally require a steam dome, as they were built large enough to allow adequate steam space within their main drum. Water-tube designs had a suitable steam drum mounted high above their evaporating surface and this performed a similar function. Some designs retained a steam dome: German and French practice often fitted them to Scotch marine boilers and other naval boilers such as the Normand, where British practice would do without. Where Cornish boilers were unusually fitted with a dome, in Cornwall this was known as a 'Dolly Varden', from the stovepipe hats forming part of the local women's traditional costume.

She is the sister ship of and , which are both still in service with NOAA. USC&GS; and NOAAS Mount Mitchell, 1968-1995 Mount Mitchell operated as a multipurpose vessel. She had an oceanographic laboratory, several echosounders, and an oceanographic winch. She also had a hydroplot data-processing system, as did two of her survey launches. Mount Mitchell conducted hydrographic surveys on the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean, and served as an oceanographic vessel throughout much of the North Atlantic Ocean on various projects. In the late 1980s she was fitted with a multi-beam sounding system for hydrographic work related to establishing the maritime exclusive economic zone of the United States and discovered Mitchell Dome among other large, economically significant undersea features in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1992 she proceeded to the Persian Gulf to study the effects of the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War oil spills into the Gulf. After returning to the United States, she resumed operations as a hydrographic survey vessel until decommissioning in 1995. =Awards= 100px Department of Commerce Silver Medal In a ceremony on 9 November 1992 in Washington, D.C., Mount Mitchell was awarded the Department of Commerce Silver Medal for her 1990-1991 Persian Gulf cruise.Program of Forty-Fourth Annual Honor Awards, United States Department of Commerce, November 9, 1992: Silver Medal Recipients: NOAA Ship Mt.

Mitchell, 2001-Present After six years of inactivity, the decommissioned Mount Mitchell was purchased in 2001 by Mt. Mitchell LLC and was completely refurbished and retrofitted with the latest in electronics, machinery, and safety equipment. With her refit complete, she arrived in Seattle, Washington, in 2003 to begin her career as the private research ship R/V Mt. Mitchell. She is managed and operated by Global Seas LLC, headquartered in Seattle. In 2008, Mt. Mitchell was outfitted with the most advanced underwater mapping equipment available. Her Kongsberg EM 120 and EM 710 high-resolution multibeam mapping systems offer a state-of-the-art capability to perform seabed mapping to full ocean depth with unrivaled resolution, coverage, and accuracy. The EM 120 system allows for accurate surveys to a depth of 11,000 meters (36,089 feet), while the EM 710 allows for accurate mapping to a depth of 2,000 meters (6,562 feet). The vessel is an acoustically quiet platform capable of supporting sophisticated sonar operations in deep water and high sea states. To ensure ship-related noise does not degrade the vessel‚Ä≤s capability to perform her science mission at full performance, the sonar systems are installed in a gondola arrangement below her hull. In addition, custom-designed propellers were installed in early 2011 to improve her efficiency. In 2008, Mt. Mitchell was outfitted with stabilization tanks and anti-roll chocks which have eliminated much of her natural roll, making hert an ideal platform for surveying. Mt. Mitchell is a very quiet vessel in comparison to other commercial research platforms and performance and acoustical testing of the EM 710 sonar demonstrated that it is identical to that obtained on the quietest United States Navy research vessels. Mt. Mitchell also operates two launches, R/V Mt. Augustine and R/V Mt. Shishaldin. For shallow-water surveying, Mt. Augustine is a 32-foot (9.75-meter) Silver Streak cuddy-cabin twin-diesel craft outfitted with a multibeam sidescan sonar mount and laboratory space that Mt. Mitchell launches and retrieves through a Vestdavit system. Mt. Shishaldin is a 25-foot (7.6-meter) landing craft that can seat six people and has a drop-down bow for landing on remote beaches; it can be used for ferrying people between ship and shore, tide gauging, and hauling all-terrain vehicles.

Gurry has been accused of trying to retaliate against a whistleblower by authorizing security staff to enter senior staff offices and take personal items away for DNA testing; improperly awarding an IT procurement contract to an acquaintance; and breaking United Nations Security Council sanctions by sending IT equipment to North Korea and Iran. An investigation was conducted by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) but its report has been shrouded in secrecy. 17 WIPO member states have asked the WIPO Coordination Committee to review the report so the issues can be resolved. On the DNA case, OIOS was unable to obtain cooperation from the Swiss authority (paragraph 66 of the OIOS Report). On the procurement case, OIOS found that Gurry \\"acted in non-compliance with WIPO's Procurement Instructions\\" (paragraph 203) and recommended the Chair of the WIPO General Assembly \\"consider taking appropriate action against Mr. Francis Gurry\\" (paragraph 206).

They are uncommon in western countries but not as rare in East Asian nations like Japan and China. Signs and symptoms Most patients have symptoms in the first year of life. It is rare for symptoms to be undetected until adulthood, and usually adults have associated complications. The classic triad of intermittent abdominal pain, jaundice, and a right upper quadrant abdominal mass is found only in minority of patients. In infants, choledochal cysts usually lead to obstruction of the bile ducts and retention of bile. This leads to jaundice and an enlarged liver. If the obstruction is not relieved, permanent damage may occur to the liver - scarring and cirrhosis - with the signs of portal hypertension (obstruction to the flow of blood through the liver) and ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen). There is an increased risk of cancer in the wall of the cyst. In older individuals, choledochal cysts are more likely to cause abdominal pain and intermittent episodes of jaundice and occasionally cholangitis (inflammation within the bile ducts caused by the spread of bacteria from the intestine into the bile ducts). Inflammation of the pancreas also may occur. The cause of these complications may be related to either abnormal flow of bile within the ducts or the presence of gallstones. Diagnosis Direct hyperbilirubinemia = Types = They were classified into 5 types by Todani in 1977. Classification was based on site of the cyst or dilatation. Type I to IV has been subtyped. * Type I: Most common variety (80-90%) involving saccular or fusiform dilatation of a portion or entire common bile duct (CBD) with normal intrahepatic duct. * Type II: These cysts are present as an isolated diverticulum protruding from the CBD. * Type III or Choledochocele: Arise from dilatation of duodenal portion of CBD or where pancreatic duct meets. * Type IVa: Characterized by multiple dilatations of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. * Type IVb: Multiple dilatations involving only the extrahepatic bile ducts. * Type V: Cystic dilatation of intrahepatic biliary ducts without extrahepatic duct disease. The presence of multiple saccular or cystic dilations of the intrahepatic ducts is known as Caroli's disease. * Type VI: An isolated cyst of the cystic duct is an extremely rare lesion. Only single case reports are documented in the literature. The most accepted classification system of biliary cysts, the Todani classification, does not include this lesion. Cholecystectomy with cystic duct ligation near the common bile duct is curative. Treatment Choledochal cysts are treated by surgical excision of the cyst with the formation of a roux-en-Y anastomosis hepaticojejunostomy/ choledochojejunostomy to the biliary duct.Future complications include cholangitis and a 2% risk of malignancy, which may develop in any part of the biliary tree. A recent article published in the Journal of Surgery suggested that choledochal cysts could also be treated with single-incision laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy with comparable results and less scarring. In cases of saccular type of cyst, excision and placement of T-shaped tube is done. Currently, there is no accepted indication for fetal intervention in the management of prenatally suspected choledochal cysts.Coran AG, et al., eds. Pediatric Surgery. 7th ed.

Also, there is a measure of privacy about their internal structure, bylaws, and membership; and some level of sworn allegiance to other members of the club. Estilo De Antes is the 1st Car Club in San Diego. History The earliest car clubs were formed in the 1930s, though the reputedly oldest lowrider club is the Dukes. The Dukes first got together in 1962. The club went on for some four years, breaking up in 1969. The club started up again but between 1970 and 1977, the ghost of the club carried on. Socially the Dukes hire out to weddings and quinceaneras as chauffeurs. They also have club picnics and enter the better car shows. Gangs, outlaws and outside of stereotyping Lowrider clubs are often perceived as criminal organizations or, at best, gangs of hoodlums or thugs. This perception has been fueled by movies, popular culture, and highly publicized isolated incidents. The organization of lowriders into clubs was done in part to eliminate the belief that they were criminal gangs.

History The main entrance to the Spanish Fortaleza de S√£o Filipe A defense study for the Azores began in the middle of the 16th century by military engineer Bartolomeu Ferraz: in his report to the Portuguese Crown, he indicated that islands of S√£o Miguel, Terceira, S√£o Jorge, Faial and Pico were vulnerable to attacks by pirates and Protestant privateers (primarily English, French and Dutch), and its ports and village required better security conditions. It was during the reigns of John III (1521‚Äì1557) and Sebastian (1568‚Äì1578) that the first defensive plans were drawn-up by the Italian architect and a military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567), who elaborated a plan of global defense for the main islands of the Azores. Further, it was his opinion that, should an enemy attack from the sea, that defenses should be concentrated at the ports and anchorages, defended by the local population, under the responsibility of each municipal authority. The final plan for Angra do Hero√≠smo and Terceira included elaboration of the coastal defenses at the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o (or the Castelinho as it is known), the Porto das Pipas and the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o (in the area of Ribeira Seca); the plan was later continued by Cipri√£o de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos, then governor of the islands, to encompass over fifty defensive works along the coast of the island. =Iberian Union= The walls of the bastion of S√£o Pedro, the main gun emplacements at the fort During the Iberian Union, the fortifications in the Bay of Angra were at the centre of the Azores and a strategic route between the goods of India and the Orient and the markets of Europe (comparable to the complex fortifications that were constructed in Havana (in Cuba) and Cartagena (in Colombia) during later epochs). The fort was erected after the conquest of Terceira by the Spanish military, as a consequence of the events related to the Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640), when, under command of √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz, King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal) retook the island from the forces of Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato. With the start of Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604), it was strengthened as privateers, such as Francis Drake (1587) and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, whose adjunct Walter Raleigh, attacked the neighbouring settlement in Horta, during the summer of 1597. The new project served to two functions: * to protect the port of Angra and the colonial fleet that sheltered in its waters, from assaults by Barbary Coast pirates and English privateers, especially when ships from India and the Orient used the islands as a staging port for the return trip to the continent; and * to garrison Spanish troops, in order to defend the island (which would be under the authority of the Marquess of Santa Cruz). The construction started in 1593, with the first cornerstone at the Santa Catarina bastion (northwest angle) in a ceremony presided by the Governor of the Presidio, Ant√≥nio de la Puebla, and the Bishop of Angra, Manuel Gouveia.Ara√∫jo (1979), p.79Ant√≥nio Cordeiro (1717), p.35 The final engineering plan was overseen by the Italian military engineer Giovanni Vicenzo Casale and his assistants, the Sienese engineer Tib√∫rcio Spannocchi and Anton Coll (Ant√£o Colla), who had planned the design in 1590. Essentially, the defensive plan was elaborated by Spannocchi, who conceived of the design after visiting the location in 1583-1584, but its position on Monte Brasil was planned by Coll, who since its foundation accompanied the work in Angra (until his death in 1618).Braz (1985), p.311 Ostensibly, the work began in 1594. Later the engineers Girolamo Franc√®s and Giovanni Battista Cairati (who was the royal architect in the court of Phillip II of Spain) participated in this project, renaming the fortress the Fortaleza de S√£o Filipe (in his monarch's honour). Due to various problems, the construction continued into the government of Diogo Fajardo (1628‚Äì1639). At this time, the three interconnected cisterns (with a capacity of 750,000 kilograms), stables (on the site of the Governor's palace) and the chapel of Santa Catarina de Sena (which was later re-baptised in honour of the Holy Spirit). The built environment was completed with local boulder stone and basalt by rocksmiths and masons, and a great part of the labourers were actually men condemned to the gallows. Others were soldiers from the presidio who were being punished and were, by Governor Diogo de Miranda Queiroz (who started the practice), obligated to participate in the work. Although this type of punishment reached its extremes during the governorship of Diogo Fajardo, it is debatable where hundreds of local Azoreans were forced to work in the project. Regardless, it is known that many Terceirenses and local islanders supported the construction of the fort through taxes and tithes. =Restoration= The Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista (c1645) constructed after the Restoration of Portuguese independence During the Portuguese Restoration (1640), Spanish forces, under the command of field- commander √Ålvaro de Viveiros, resisted for eleven months (from 27 March 1641 to 4 March 1642). It was only with the multi-island force commanded by Francisco Ornelas da C√¢mara and Jo√£o de Bettencourt that the deadlock was broken, and the forces capitulated. Surrendering with military honour, the Spaniards were permitted to retreat with their personal arms and two bronze artillery pieces, along with their munition. They left behind 138 steel and bronze cannons, 392 arquebuses, 400 muskets and their associated munitions.Ara√∫jo (1979), p.80 With the recapture of the fort, it was rechristened to the invocation of John the Baptist (), homage to John IV of Portugal; the church was later constructed to honour their patron saint in 1642. In 1658, one of the bastions were repaired (although its unclear which),Sousa (1996) while in 1662 reconstruction and renovation was completed that were expensive (comparable to almost the same costs associated with the soldiers and officers).Maldonado (1990), p.380 In the second half of the 17th century, the gunpowder magazine supported the fortifications in the rest of the island. Within the citadel, single soldiers, married couples (some with families) and retired officers/enlisted lived together. Along the flanks of Monte Brasil the groups maintained plots of land for a subsistence agriculture. At the end the century, the religious Brotherhood to the Cult of the Holy Spirit was one of the richest in the city. At the beginning of the 18th century, Father Ant√≥nio Cordeiro, writing of the community Angra and the citadel within the Fortaleza de S√£o Jo√£o Baptista: :\\"To the east there run many roads, or quarters of homes in rock and lime, of two-stories, and that can house 50 soldiers and ordinarily have 300 neighbours...The city of Angra has six parishes, (which includes the noble population that is in the great Castle, and which has a main chapel...\\"Ant√≥nio Cordeiro (1717) But, progressively, within the century, some of its spaces were being used for training, which lasted until the 19th century. By 1720 the craftsmen had completed the remodelling work on the church, which was at a time that the fortress had 60 active emplacements.Ant√≥nio Corderio (1717), p.38 =Liberal Wars= The main entrance to the fort showing the elaborate portico of volcanic rock Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil, Rio de Janeiro Following the Porto Liberal Revolution of 1820 that ushered in the Liberal movement, the fort was the site where the first Liberal forces took power, under the command of Captain-general, brigadier Francisco Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo (2 April 1821). It was also here that the first counter-revolution was fought two days later (3‚Äì4 April 1821). The Liberal government in Terceira established a money house within the fort (7 May 1829) to coin \\"malucos\\"(which were equivalent to 100 r√©is) for the government of the Prince Regent John: based on the same design coined in Rio de Janeiro during the exile. The year 1829 was also the year where, in conjunction with the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o, the Fort of S√£o Baptista repelled an assault by a Miguelist squadron in the Bay of Angra. Related to the success of the Liberal movement, during the tumult of the first battles of the Liberal Wars between Peter IV and his brother, Miguel, it was the 5th Infantry Battalion that restored the rights of Peter and Constitutional monarchy. The unit received a flag personally embroidered by Queen Maria II with gold-inlay for their services. At the end of the century (1896), the fort was the permanent home of African King Gungunhana, who was politically imprisoned within its walls until his death on 23 December 1906. =20th century= A modern military emplacement, remnants of the First and Second World Wars, now part of the open-air Armry Museum of the Museum of Angra do Hero√≠smo At the outbreak of the First World War, Portugal was a neutral nation, but this progressively changed due in most part to its concerns over its dependencies and economic blockades with its main markets. Following a request by England to detain German nationals, Germany declared war on Portugal (which was reciprocated on 9 March 1916). The original detainees and subsequent German nationals were transferred to the Fortress of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista between 1916 and 1919 (the end of the War). The use of the fort as a prison for political prisoners was continued during the Estado Novo regime: in 1933 a military presidio created and in 1943 a \\"Dep√≥sito de Presos de Angra\\" (deposit for Angran convicts) was also established. By the middle of the century, a plan by the Comiss√£o da Avalia√ß√£o das Novas Infra-estruturas das For√ßas Armadas (CANIFA) (Armed Forces Commission on the Evaluation of New Infrastructures) demolished the buildings west of the fort and east of the Church. Meanwhile, it became a communications centre (Centro de Comunica√ß√µes da Armada) for the Portuguese Armed Forces, and later a radio antenna was erected to create and support Pico R√°dio. The remaining fortress complex was classified on 18 August 1943 as a Property of Public Interest (under decree No.32-973) by the Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments). In 1956 the Servi√ßos dos Monumentos Nacionais (National Monument Services) completed some renovations of the Church, while a recuperation of the fort began with a smaller conservation project in 1959. As part of the historical centre, the Fort was included as part of the UNESCO designated World Heritage Site in 1983. Visitors to Monte Brasil, apart from the many walking trails, can be guided by members of the armed forces, who provide historical interpretation tours of its grounds. Between 1995 and 1997 (on three separate projects) the walls of the fort were consolidated and strengthened. In 1997, the Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista was completely renovated (including both interiors and exteriors). The reconstruction of the wall along the Bay of Fanal was begun in 2000, and completed by 2001, when the recuperation of the roofs of the hermitage of Santa Catarina were initiated. In 2011, the cost to repair and maintain the site was estimated at 100,000 Euros annually, which included maintaining the walls straight and spaces clean, yet costs associated with repairs to many of the buildings, drainage systems and water networks, electrical networks, was estimated at four million Euros. Architecture Bateria de D. Pedro IV (1828) Bateria de D. Maria II (1829) The remains of the Fort of Santo Ant√≥nio do Monte Brasil The ruins of the walls of the Fort of S√£o Benedito The fortress dominates the promontory of Monte Brasil, a volcanic cone situated along the southern coast of Terceira, at the extreme tip of the city of Angra linked by an isthmus, on either side of which it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, and the bays of Fanal and Angra. The actual structure covers an area of 3 km¬≤ and is constituted a principal nucleus with a 111.5 metre long curtain of walls (three bastions and two partial-bastions) that extend 570 metres, to a maximum height of 15 metres and while at most 2.6 metres wide. Within these walls, some the lands was excavated to about 10 metres, and trenches (of equal depth) are located outside the walls. In addition, the edge of each the fort's limits are another two walls that encircle the peninsula. The five bastions that reinforce the wall at the isthmus are, from west to east: * Bastion of Santa Catarina (Saint Catherine), over the cliffs of Fanal, with seven cannon and crowned by the Torre√£o dos Mosquitos (a rounded lookout) used as a forward sight for the location's batteries with its own gunpowder magazine. It is connected by two levels of embankments (with four emplacements) to the Bastion of S√£o Pedro; * Bastion of S√£o Pedro (Saint Peter), to the left of the Port√£o de Armas (main portico), with 15 cannon emplacements. Supported by its own magazine, the bastion in 1766 defended attacks with six cannons to the left and seven to the right of the main door.The Gate of Arms, in volcanic rock, inspired in the Mannerist- style was originally crowned by coat-of-arms of the Spanish Royal Family, but was substituted by the Portuguese arms after the Portuguese Restoration. * Bastion of Boa Nova (Good New), located along the S√£o Pedro Bastion, contained 16 cannon, supported by two gunpowder magazines and the lookout at the Torre√£o da Bandeira (the lookout also served to hoist the imperial flag, hence its name). The bastion, which overlooks the Bay of Angra, was renamed (from a marble inscription on its battery) in the context of the Liberal Wars in honour of Peter IV of Portugal (Battery of Peter IV). Following this emplacement is the Battery of Maria II (similarly named in honour of Queen Maria II after the Liberal Wars), and later the Battery of Malaca which, at one time housed a bronze, 36-calibre cannon from the Fort of Diu (which was returned to Lisbon on 22 July 1771. From the Malaca Battery, by way of the arch of the Port√£o de Armas, a staircase descends to an old garden; and * Bastion of the Esp√≠rito Santo (Holy Spirit), which overlooks the Campo do Relv√£o, where were located four cannons and three gunpowder magazines (one in the middle and the other two on either angle), linked to a wall with six cannons and one magazine, that end; * Bastion of Santa Luzia (Saint Lucy), with five cannons and one magazine, that extend to two descending walls (with its own cannon emplacement and magazine). In addition, by 1849, another gunpowder magazine, referred to as the Paiol Novo, was constructed. Also located in this bastion, was the building of the artillery laboratory, which was actually a replacement for an older, larger building that was destroyed in a violent fire on 7 May 1821, resulting in five deaths. On the western flank of the fort, near the Santa Catarina Bastion and over the Bay of Fanal, there also exists the Arsenal Battery with five other cannon emplacements. The Santa Luzia Bastion is also connected by the one kilometre long Santo Ant√≥nio wall, along the eastern coast of Monte Brasil, with several ancillary fortifications (from north to south): * Gate of Portinho Novo; * Gate of Porta do Cais da Figueirinha; * Redoubt of Dois Paus; * Redoubt of S√£o Francisco; * Fort of S√£o Benedito do Monte Brasil (also the Redoubt of Tr√™s Paus); * Redoubt of Santo In√°cio; and * Fort of Santo Ant√≥nio do Monte Brasil. Along the southeast of the peninsula, towards the open ocean, the defense was manned by the small Forte da Quebrada, dominated by the Vigia da Baleia lookout, while on the west coast, ancillary fortifications extended another kilometre (from south to north): * Constitui√ß√£o battery; * Fort of S√£o Diogo do Monte Brasil (also the Fort of Zimbreiro); * Fidelidade battery; * Redoubt of General Saldanha; * Redoubt of S√£o Gon√ßalo; * Redoubt of Santa Cruz; * Redoubt of Santa Teresa; and the * Cais do Castelo. Within the fort four cisterns were constructed the arsenal and company of soldiers, including: the interior of the main castle (which alone had a capacity of 1,500 m¬≥); another within the Fort of Santo Ant√≥nio; in the interior of the Fort of Quebrada; and along the wall of the Zimbreiro Fort (where a grotto collects water annually).

The XM202 prototype launcher was tested in the Vietnam War, as part of the XM191 system. Description The M202A1 features four tubes that can load 66 mm incendiary rockets. The M74 rockets are equipped with M235 warheads, containing approximately 1.34 pounds (0.61 kg) of an incendiary agent. The substance, often mistaken for napalm, is in fact TPA (thickened pyrophoric agent). TPA is triethylaluminum (TEA) thickened with polyisobutylene. TEA, an organometallic compound, is pyrophoric and burns spontaneously at temperatures of 1600 ¬∞C (2912 ¬∞F) when exposed to air. It burns \\"white hot\\" because of the aluminum, much hotter than gasoline or napalm. The light and heat emission is very intense and can produce skin burns from some (close) distance without direct contact with the flame, by thermal radiation alone. The M202 was designed to share its 66mm caliber with the contemporary M72 LAW antitank rocket launcher, to allow it to be used as an antitank launcher. While HEAT rounds were trialled with the XM191 launcher under the designation XM78, no HEAT clips were ever manufactured for the M202. Similarly, a crowd control agent round using CS gas, the XM96, was trialled, but never entered service. The weapon is meant to be fired from the right shoulder, and can be fired from either a standing, crouching, or prone position. It is loaded with a clip which holds a set of four rockets together, which is inserted into the rear of the launcher and can be pushed past the launching position to enable the launcher to be carried while loaded more easily. thumb The M202A1 was rated as having a 50% chance of hit against the following targets at the noted ranges, assuming all four rockets were fired at the same time: * Bunker aperture: 50 meters * Window: 125 meters * Weapons position or stationary vehicle: 200 meters * Squad-sized troop formation: 500 meters The M202A1 was issued as needed, generally one per rifle platoon, although the headquarters of rifle companies were authorized nine M202A1s. As with most RPGs, no dedicated gunners were trained, the weapon instead being carried in addition to the rifleman's standard weapon. While vastly more lightweight than the M2 flamethrower it replaced, the weapon was still bulky to use and the ammunition suffered from reliability problems. As a result, the weapon had mostly been relegated to storage by the mid-1980s, even though it nominally remains a part of the U.S. Army arsenal. The M202A1 has been among weapons listed on the inventory of U.S. units in the War in Afghanistan.Hambling, David (May 15, 2009). \\"U.S. Denies Incendiary Weapon Use in Afghanistan\\". Wired.com.

Vasantotsavam is the combination of 2 words - \\"Vasantha\\" (Spring season in Sanskrit) and \\"Utsavam\\" (festival in Sanskrit). The festival is celebrated on the three days of tryodasi, chaturdasi and pournami in the month of Chaitra In the Gregorian calendar, the festival occurs between the end of March through mid-April. History & start The start of the festival celebration in Tirumala is recorded during the period of Achyutaraya (Saka 1460). The festival was started with the fund of 3000 narpanam contributed by Periya Solai, the son of the accountant in the temple. Function The festival starts with ankurarpanam (sowing the nine kind of seeds) ceremony conducted on the day of Uttarabhadra star in Hindu calendar month of phalguna. One day before the start of the Vasanthotsavam festival, punya vachanam (purificatory rites), vaasthu santhi (worship of deity and lord of nature and their elements and natural forces as well as lord and deity of directions and environment) and samprokshanam rituals are performed by the temple priests(sacred consecration). Access to these rituals are not open to public. Abhishekam - specifically called Snapana Thirumanjanam (Holy bathing), is performed to the utsava murthy and his consorts on all the three days in the Vasanthotsavam hall outside the temple premises. On the third day, abhishekam is performed to the idols of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman along with Krishna and Rukmini.Procession of the consecrated idols are taken in a procession in the evening on all the three days. The Vasanthotsavam hall was demolished as part of the revamping of the temple surroundings in 2006 and since then the Vaibhavotsava Mandapam situated in front of the main temple is used for the festival.

Background Joe Baksi was a child of the Kulpmont, Pennsylvania coal mines. His parents was of Slovak descent. He was quoted as saying that he never had any intention of being a boxer, but he saw it \\"as a ticket to a better way of life, out of the coal mines.\\"Joe Baksi Dies at 55,NY Times, August 8, 1977, p26 He broke into professional boxing in 1940 at the age of 18.

Palance recounts a \\"pier 6 brawl\\" with BaksiOscar- winning thesp Palance dies, Variety, November 10, 2006 Becoming a contender Baksi campaigned over the boxing circuit for a number of years, until he got his first big match with Tami Mauriello on February 25, 1944 at Madison Square Garden. Mauriello was the 5-11 favorite, and the bronx contender for the Heavyweight crown. Mauriello was expected to win, based on his experience. Baski hoped to win by matching punch with punch and using his 210 vs. 196 lb weight advantage to his favor.Mauriello Choice to Vanquish Baksi NY Times, February 25, 1944, p20 Tami was floored late in the first round with a left hook by Baksi, and was down for a nine count. Tami faced a battering and battled back to prevent his first knockout defeat. Baksi won by unanimous decision.James Dawson, Baksi Outpoints Mauriello in 10-Round Upset, NY Times, February 26, 1944, p18 Baksi's upset over Tami sprang him to nationwide prominence. He was the favorite to beat Lee Savold two weeks later at the Garden, having the weight advantage and coming off his victory over Mauriello (who had beaten Savold twice before).Baksi 1-2 Choice to Defeat Savold, NY Times, March 10, 1944, p18 But Baksi was a tyro compared to Savold. Baksi got off to a slow start, and though he showed advantage in the ninth and tenth rounds Savold boxed his way with left hooks and jabs to win a split decision that night.Joseph Nichols, Savold Beats Baksi in Heavyweight Bout, NY Times, March 11, 1944, p18 They had a rematch on March 10, 1944. This time, Savold was the 5-7 favorite.Savold 5-7 Choice to Vanquish Baksi, NY Times, May 26, 1944, p14 Baksi was in better shape that night, and fought a careful fight, out \\"left-handing\\" Savold, who was thought to have the best southpaw amongst the heavyweight contenders. At the finish Savold's left eye was cut, his nose and mouth bleeding, and his left side looked like raw hamburger. Baksi's only wound was a broken nose.Joseph Nichols, Baksi Decisively Outpoints Savold in 12-Round Heavyweight Bout, NY Times, May 27, 1944, p20 He won a unanimous decision. His victory advanced him to be ranked 4th in the N.B.A rankings, behind champion Joe Louis, and boxers Billy Conn and Jimmy Bivins.Baksi Placed 4th in N.B.A Rankings, NY Times, July 14, 1944, p18 Baksi went on to beat Savold again on August 7, 1944. In his next fight, Baksi defeated Finnish boxer Gunnar Baerlund (GeeBee) and then scheduled a fight with his former sparring partner Lee Oma on January 28, 1945. Oma, unknown six months previously, gained fame by putting up a spirited fight against Mauriello in September. Oma lost that fight but earned a rematch in December, which he won. Still, Baksi was a 1-3 favorite to beat Oma. He had a 25-pound advantage over Oma, and corresponding advantages in height, reach, and punching power. But he lacked mental alertness that night, having suffered a cold over the last several days before the fight. He made a late comeback in the fight, but lost the fight by a unanimous decision.James Dawson, Oma Beats Baksi in Boxing Upset, NY Times, January 27, 1945, p17 Baksi went on to win a unanimous decision against Lou Nova on March 30, flooring Nova in the fourth round with a left hook to the ribs that kept Nova down for a count of nine.Joseph Nichols, Baksi Beats Nova, NY Times, March 31, 1945, p25 Baksi was now the second ranked (wartime) heavyweight. He scored easy decisions against Lee Dixie Oliver and Larry Lane, and then fought a thirty-one-year-old Jersey Joe Walcott. Walcott had lost earlier bouts with world-class professionals, and was an underdog against Baksi. But Walcott won, scoring 6-3-1 on the single referees scorecard. Walcott's dancing and dodging allowed him to escape Baksi's reach, and he was able to get in enough hooks to make Baksi groggy.Walcott Outboxes Baksi, NY Times, August 3, 1945, p20 Baksi lost his next fight with Jimmy Bell (a split decision in which Baksi was penalized two rounds for a low blow), but then racked up four easy wins before traveling to Europe. Europe and back Baksi left for Europe on October 9, 1946 to fight the two British champions. He first defeated British light heavy weight champion Freddie Mills. Baksi was sluggish in the first round, but Mills (who had chronic eye problems) suffered a cut in his right eye in the second round, and his left eye in the third. After a bad battering, Mills gave up at the end of the sixth round.Baksi Stops Mills, NY Times, November 6, 1946, p41 Baksi then went on to fight British heavyweight champion Bruce Woodcock. Baksi floored Woodcock three times in the first round and twice in the second. Woodcock made a comeback in the fifth, but Baksi was scoring at will when the referee stopped it in the seventh.American Batters British Champion, NY Times, April 16, 1947, p33 Woodcock went to the hospital with a broken jaw. After defeating Woodcock, Baksi was scheduled to fight Joe Louis for the world heavyweight title. Baksi, still in Europe after the Woodcock fight, signed a contract to fight the Swedish champion, Olle Tandberg in Stockholm. Baksi was the 1-5 favorite to beat Tandberg, and 1-3 favorite to knock him out by the seventh round.Baksi 1-5 Favorite In Stockholm Bout, NY Times, July 6, 1947, p89 Baksi was going into the ring with 6 straight victories (five by knockout), while Tandberg had been fighting only since 1943, and only against local fighters. Then, in what the New York Times reported as the greatest upset in years, Baksi lost a split decision. Even Tandberg was surprised, saying after the fight \\"I didn't believe I had won the fight. I thought I was too much on the defensive in the closing rounds.\\"Decision Awarded To Swedish Boxer, NY Times, July 7, 1947, p21 After his stunning defeat, Baksi took a year off. He was still the third ranked heavyweight contender, behind Jersey Joe Walcott and Ezzard Charles, and ahead of Lee Savold,NBA Keeps Louis at Top of Division, NY Times, September 17, 1948, p35 when he scheduled a fight with Ezzard Charles. The winner of that fight would have a title match with Joe Louis. Charles, the 5-14 favorite, defeated Baksi by TKO in the seventh.James Dawson, Charles Stops Baksi in Eleventh to Become Leading Contender, NY Times, December 11, 1948, p19 Later career After being beaten by Charles, his status as a contender faded. After beating some obscure and aging boxers, he went into semi-retirement in 1951. He then made a comeback attempt in 1954, fighting Billy Smith, who he knocked out in the first round. His second match was with a tougher opponent, Bob \\"The Grinder\\" Baker, who was the 7-5 favorite. Baksi had little to offer except courage and stamina, and lost by unanimous decision. Baksi's manager, Leo Feureisen, collapsed during the fight and died in the dressing room a short while after.Baker Sets Back Baksi on Points, NY Times, May 25, 1954, p32 Baksi went into permanent retirement after the bout. He then became a teamster and later an ironworker and joined the International Brotherhood of Ironworkers. Trivia In the book Trainspotting, by Irvine Welsh, several of the characters use the phrase Joe Baksi to refer to a taxi, an example of rhyming slang used frequently throughout the UK.

Biography Marchant was born on March 17, 1816, in Bath, England, where he was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1844 and became the leader of the Latter Day Saints in BathDoxey, Cynthia. \\"Church in Britain & the 1851 Religious Census\\". Mormon Historical Studies. Spring 2003, p. 131. and Birmingham. Marchant's father was a firefighter in Bath who died trying to rescue a servant girl from a fire.YOUNGBERG, F. C. (1999). Conquerors of the West stalwart Mormon pioneers. Salt Lake City, Agreka Books, p. 1521\\"SUDDEN AND SEVERE DISTRESS\\", Bath Journal, Monday July 17, 1815 He died months before his son's birth. After an apprenticeship he became a successful merchant tailor in Bath. He grew into a tall man with a full build. He fell in love with a young milliner, Lydia Johnson and they secretly married February 17, 1837, before his apprenticeship was up. Bath Abbey in Bath, England Mormon missionaries began preaching in Bath in 1843, and in early 1844 Lydia became interested in the religion. Abraham discouraged her participation, and when he found out she was to be baptized, he set out to stop her. However, on the way he was delayed by a mad bull, and by the time he made it to the place where baptisms were being performed, he was too late. However, he later changed his mind about this new religion and within a month he was also baptized. Some of the Marchant acquaintances accepted their decision to join the Mormons, while others belittled them. One group of influential people were able to assign a young man with mental impairment as Abraham's apprentice, whom they encouraged to be as belligerent as possible. The young man reportedly hit Lydia several times and once threatened her with a butcher knife. Abraham invested four pounds five shillings (about 250 pounds as of 2005) in a joint stock company set up to move Mormon emigrants to the United States. However, the individuals put in charge of the company mismanaged the funds, and investors lost most of their capital. Those in charge were disfellowshipped from the church and church leaders faced the task of consoling members who had lost their savings. John Taylor came to Bath for this purpose. After dispelling whatever bitterness the Marchants may have felt, Taylor returned to their home often and became a lifelong friend. St. Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham, England The Marchants longed to immigrate to the United States, but waited until they had the money. In need of accumulating eight pounds per family memberThis was the cost for passage to Council Bluffs, Iowa. The total cost per person to reach the Salt Lake Valley was closer to twenty pounds per person, or about GBP 1,375 per person in modern money. (about GBP 550 in modern money) for passage to the United States, in late 1851 the Marchants moved to Birmingham, a bustling industrial city where tailor services were in demand and customers were less likely to bother about Abraham's religion. His reputation in the church preceded him and he was immediately appointed to the Birmingham Conference presidency. Despite the staid Victorian environment in England at the time, when the church announced the doctrine of plural marriage, Abraham reported that \\"a great spirit of inquiry respecting the Patriarchal order of Marriage was manifested\\" among church members in Birmingham.Pearson, Lee M. \\"History of Abraham & Lydia Johnson Marchant\\". http://www.ourlittlecircle.com. http://www.ourlittlecircle.com/journals/abraham_marchant_and_lydia_johnson.html . Accessed 12 May 2007. By February 1854, Abraham had saved the money to emigrate and booked ordinary passage for himself, Lydia, and their eight children on the Windermere. He paid for the tickets himself rather than relying on the Perpetual Emigration Fund (PEF). The ship sailed on February 22 and arrived in New Orleans on April 20. However, when they arrived in St. Louis, the cost of equipment and provisions for crossing the plains had recently doubled, forcing them to turn to the PEF for help. Marchant arrived with other settlers in the area now known as Peoa in 1862 and was soon named \\"First Elder\\" and then Bishop of the settlement. As more settlements sprang up within Summit County, he acted as the Bishop of over the entire southern half of the county, including Peoa, Rockport, Wanship, and Kamas. He served in that capacity until his death.\\"John Lambert\\". www.rootsweb.com. http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db;=venitarjl&id;=I18. Accessed 12 May 2007. See also Jenson, Andrew.

The band is led by singer and guitarist Elizabeth Powell. History Before becoming the front-woman for Land of Talk, Elizabeth Powell began her career as a solo artist performing under the name ELE_K*. Her debut album was released in 2003 through independent Canadian label Sinistre Sound. Powell began writing music at the age of fourteen while she grew up in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. She enrolled in the jazz program at Concordia University where she met Chris McCarron and Mark Wheaton with whom she formed Land of Talk.Dunlevy, T‚ÄôCha (December 2006). \\"Talk of the town: 2006 was busy for Montreal‚Äôs dreamy, gritty Land of Talk, and 2007 looks even busier.\\" The Montreal Gazette. Eric Thibodeau replaced Wheaton on drums in May 2007 to complete a new lineup.\\"Bucky Leaves Land of Talk!\\" . Gen Art Pulse. May 4, 2007. \\"Some bands have a bit more of a meteoric rise, and some are slow burners. I like to think we're a slow burner,\\" Powell says. \\"It's totally true to who I am and how I approach my own life. Very slow and very unsure, but curious. And it all works out.\\" Land of Talk has received funding from agencies such as the Canada Council Funding for the Arts (FACTOR). =Applause Cheer Boo Hiss= The band released its first EP, Applause Cheer Boo Hiss, on April 4, 2006, on Dependent Music. The single \\"Summer Special\\" deals with the damaging nature of intra-female conflict and the sadness of losing oneself by way of buying into the damaging stereotypes of femininity. Powell commented in an interview about what inspired her to write \\"Summer Special\\" and how it compared to her life growing up as a tomboy. Another stand-out track from the EP is \\"Speak to Me Bones\\", which also deals with the theme of relational conflict. This track exemplifies their use of soft vocals and gritty rock sounding musical arrangements. The music video for \\"Speak to Me Bones\\" was directed by a former Concordia school mate, Jeff St. Jules. The concept of the video was kept simple, shot in black and white staying true to the band's no- frills style. =Some Are Lakes= Land of Talk released their first full- length album, Some Are Lakes, on Secret City Records in Canada and Saddle Creek Records in the US. The album was released on October 7, 2008, and was produced by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Drums on the album are played by Andrew Barr of The Slip. Powell announced during a performance that the band would be taking a break after its tour with Broken Social Scene. The band did not in fact go on hiatus, but instead McCarron left (amicably) to play guitar for The Dears. He was replaced by Joe Yarmush, and the band announced a West Coast tour for 2009. =Fun and Laughter EP= Land of Talk released the EP Fun and Laughter on October 27, 2009, on Saddle Creek. Via Saddle Creek: \\"Land of Talk have announced a west coast tour beginning October 27th in San Diego, and running through November 7th in Vancouver B.C.. To complement to tour, the band will be releasing an EP with four new songs and three videos, entitled 'Fun and Laughter'.\\". Saddle Creek =Cloak and Cipher= Early in 2009, Powell had to cancel the band's tour to recover from a hemorrhage vocal polyp. Powell used her six-month recuperation period to write and record the next album, titled Cloak and Cipher. It was released on August 24, 2010, on Saddle Creek Records. It has contributions from Patrick Watson, as well as members of Stars, Arcade Fire, Thee Silver Mt. Zion, Wintersleep, Besnard Lakes and Esmerine. Cloak and Cipher appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart that fall. In 2011, Powell posted on Land of Talk's official Facebook page to sell one of her guitar amps. The Land of Talk Facebook page stopped updating, and management eventually confirmed a hiatus. =2015‚Äì2017: Revival, Life After Youth= On April 25, 2015, Powell played her first show since 2011 at the Roots North Music Festival in Orillia, Ontario. On December 5, the band social media pages were updated for the first time in 4 years, with a photo of Powell showing the peace sign.

The president is elected by members of parliament, not by the general population. The Presidential Electoral College, a three committee body, elects the president. Each of the three committees, made up of Amyotha Hluttaw, Pyithu Hluttaw members of parliament, or military-appointed lawmakers, nominates a candidate for presidency. The candidate with the highest number of votes from the Electoral College is elected president, while the two other candidates become vice-presidents. The president serves for a term of 5 years. Should a president resign for any reason or die in office, the Presidential Electoral College will meet and each of the three committees will nominate a candidate to finish out the prior President's term so that the terms of the legislature and presidency are synchronised. The candidate who receives the most votes from the nominees is elected. The incumbent president is Win Myint. While he is the head of state and de jure head of government, the de facto head of government and the dominant state figure is the State Counsellor of Myanmar and leader of the ruling National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi. The position of President was created in 1948, with the adoption of the Burmese Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom. Since then, eleven people have held the office (with two of them doing so on multiple occasions). Due to the country's long period of military rule, it has not been uncommon for the prime minister to be a serving (or recently retired) military officer. The actual power of the prime minister has considerably varied over time, differing based on who holds the office. In 2004, a power struggle between the then‚Äìhead of state, Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Peace and Development Council, and his President, General Khin Nyunt, resulted in the prime minister being dismissed and arrested. The position was abolished on 30 March 2011, according to the current Constitution (adopted in 2008). It provided that the president is both the head of state and head of government. But after the 2015 general election, as Suu Kyi was constitutionally barred from becoming President, a position called State Counsellor, similar to President, was established for her on 2016. Qualifications The Constitution of Myanmar sets the principle qualifications that the candidate must meet to be eligible to the office of the President. in Chapter 1: The President, Part I: The Federation of Myanmar in the Constitution of Myanmar. President has to be: * A citizen of Myanmar. * At least 45 years of age. * Qualified to be elected as member of the National Assembly. According to the Constitution of Myanmar, the president: # shall be loyal to the Union and its citizens; # shall be a citizen of Myanmar who was born of both parents who were born in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Union and being Myanmar Nationals; # shall be an elected person who has attained at least the age of 45; # shall be well acquainted with the affairs of the Union such as political, administrative, economic and military; # shall be a person who has resided continuously in the Union for at least 20 years up to the time of his election as President (Proviso: An official period of stay in a foreign country with the permission of the Union shall be counted as a residing period in the Union) # shall he himself, one of the parents, the spouse, one of the legitimate children or their spouses not owe allegiance to a foreign power, not be subject of a foreign power or citizen of a foreign country. They shall not be persons entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of a subject of a foreign government or citizen of a foreign country; # shall possess prescribed qualifications of the President, in addition to qualifications prescribed to stand for election to the Hluttaw. Moreover, upon taking oath in office, the president is constitutionally forbidden from taking part in any political party activities (Chapter III, 64). Election process The president is not directly elected by Burmese voters; instead, they are indirectly elected by the Presidential Electoral College (), an electoral body made of three separate committees. One committee is composed of MPs who represent the proportions of MPs elected from each Region or State; another is composed of MPs who represent the proportions of MPs elected from each township population; the third is of military-appointed MPs personally nominated by the Defence Services' commander-in-chief. Each of the three committees nominates a presidential candidate. Afterward, all the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw MPs vote for one of three candidates‚Äîthe candidate with the highest number of votes is elected president, while the other two are elected as vice-presidents. This process is similar to the one prescribed by the 1947 Constitution, in which MPs from the Parliament's Chamber of Nationalities and Chamber of Deputies elected the president by secret ballot.The Constitution of the Union of Burma (1947), Chapter V: The President The President was then responsible for appointing a prime minister (on the advice of the Chamber of Deputies), who was constitutionally recognised as the head of government and led the Cabinet. Constitution of Myanmar Before independence, Myanmar had two quasi- constitutions, The government of Burma Act, 1935 and Constitution of Burma under Japanese occupation, 1943. After independence, Myanmar adopted three constitutions in 1947, 1974 and 2008.2008 constitution is present constitution of Myanmar. =1947 Constitution= The 1947 constitution was drafted by Chan Htoon and was used from the country's independence in 1948 to 1962, when the constitution was suspended by the socialist Union Revolutionary Council, led by military general Ne Win. The national government consisted of three branches: judicial, legislative and executive. The legislative branch was a bicameral legislature called the Union Parliament, consisting of two chambers, the 125-seat Chamber of Nationalities ( Lumyozu Hluttaw) and the Chamber of Deputies ( Pyithu Hluttaw), whose seat numbers were determined by the population size of respective constituencies.The 1947 constitution was largely based on the 1946 Yugoslav Constitution, and several Burmese officials visited Zabeleska o razgovoru druga Price sa predstavnikom burmanske vlade Maung Ohn, dana 5 decembra 1947 godine [Minutes of conversation between comrade Prica and the representative of the Burmese Government Maung Ohn, December 5th 1947]. =1974 Constitution= Approved in a 1973 referendum, the 1974 constitution was the second constitution to be written. It created a unicameral legislature called the People's Assembly (Pyithu Hluttaw), represented by members of the Burma Socialist Programme Party The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma. Each term was 4 years. Ne Win became the president at this time. =1988, 2008= Upon taking power in September 1988, the military based State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) suspended the 1974 constitution.

The constitutional convention was again called in 2004, but without the NLD. Myanmar remained without a constitution until 2008. 2008 Constitution On 9 April 2008, the military government of Myanmar (Burma) released its proposed constitution for the country to be put to a vote in public referendum on 10 May 2008, as part of its roadmap to democracy. The constitution is hailed by the military as heralding a return to democracy, but the opposition sees it as a tool for continuing military control of the country. =2008 constitutional referendum= =2012 by-elections= In spite of its earlier opposition to the 2008 constitution, the NLD participated in the 2012 by-election for 46 seats and won a landslide victory, with Aung San Suu Kyi becoming a member of parliament, alongside 42 others from her party. History Prior to 1863, different regions of modern-day Burma were governed separately. From 1862 to 1923, the colonial administration, housed in Rangoon's Secretariat building, was headed by a chief commissioner (1862‚Äì1897) or a lieutenant-governor (1897‚Äì1923), who headed the administration, underneath the governor-general of India. From 31 January 1862 to 1 May 1897, British Burma was headed by a chief commissioner. The subsequent expansion of British Burma, with the acquisitions of Upper Burma and the Shan States throughout this period increased the demands of the position, and led to an upgrade in the colonial leadership and an expansion of government (Burma was accorded a separate government and legislative council in 1897). Consequently, from 1 May 1897 to 2 January 1923, the province was led by a lieutenant governor. In 1937, Burma was formally separated from British India and began to be administered as a separate British colony, with a fully elected bicameral legislature, consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives. From 2 January 1923 to 4 January 1948, British Burma was led by a Governor, who led the cabinet and was responsible for the colony's defence, foreign relations, finance, and ethnic regions (Frontier Areas and Shan States). From 1 January 1944 to 31 August 1946, a British military governor governed the colony. During the Japanese occupation of Burma from 1942 to 1945, a Japanese military commander headed the government, while the British-appointed governor headed the colony in exile. Burma became independent in 1948. There was a president from 1948 to 1962, and then 1974 and 1988. Between 1962 and 1974 and between 1988 and 2011, Burma was headed by military regimes. The office of the president was restored in 2011. List of presidents (1948‚Äìpresent) Latest election On 15 March 2016, the Assembly of the Union elected Htin Kyaw as the 9th president of Myanmar. He resigned on 21 March 2018 and Myint Swe became acting president. On 28 March 2018, the Assembly of the Union elected Win Myint as the 10th president of Myanmar.

Ordered in 1930, she was laid down at Chatham Dockyard in January 1931 and launched on 8 January 1932. Commissioned on 27 February 1933, Sturgeon was assigned to the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. At the start of World War II, Sturgeon conducted patrols in the North Sea. On 6 September, she was mistakenly bombed by British aircraft. On her second patrol, she fired three torpedoes at an unidentified submarine, which was in fact her sister ship , but the torpedoes missed. On her third patrol, she missed the German U-boat and was damaged after hitting the bottom, requiring repairs. On 20 November, she sank the German armed trawler with torpedoes. The sinking was the first successful attack by a British submarine of the war, and was a morale boost for British submariners. During her next patrols in the North Sea, Sturgeon sighted and sank several ships, including the German troop transport Pionier and the Danish merchants SS Sigrun and SS Delfinus. Afterwards, Sturgeon patrolled in the Bay of Biscay, acted as a beacon during Operation Torch, then, after being again damaged by Allied aircraft, escorted the Arctic Convoys PQ 15 and PQ 17. Sturgeon was transferred to the 8th Submarine Flotilla, which operated on the Mediterranean Sea, in October 1942 to support the Allied landings in North Africa. In May 1943, she was loaned to the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS Zeehond. Zeehond was returned to the Royal Navy following the war and was sold for scrap in 1946.

It tells the story of a family with strained relationships which gathers at the parents' home for Christmas, only to learn that their mother has leukemia. It was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Junon Vuillard, married to Abel, is the iron-willed matriarch of the family. Junon held her family together through tough times, but her willpower made her children resentful. Junon remains handsome, and though her husband, who owns a small factory, is obese and elderly, he retains clarity, acceptance, tolerance, and unconditional love for his family. He and their mutual love holds a fragmented family together, albeit uneasily. They have three children in their 30s. Eldest is Elizabeth, a successful playwright and married to the equally successful Claude. Their only child is 16-year-old Paul, mentally ill and taking powerful medication. The middle child is Henri, who drinks too much and has always fought with everyone else. He has a new girlfriend, Faunia. Ivan is their youngest, married to Sylvia with two sons, Basile and Baptiste. Henri and Ivan are friends with Simon, their cousin raised with them after his parents‚Äô death. Simon works in Abel's plant, but is a part-time painter. He is an alcoholic, frequently in trouble for public brawling. All three men were interested in Sylvia once, but manipulated her to think that only Ivan loved her; she married and grew to love him. Junon‚Äôs other son, Joseph, is the presence around which everyone's psyches revolve: he died of leukemia when six, despite trying to save him by having another child who could be a bone marrow donor. It may be that the part of siblings' poor relationship is the mutual resentment for not saving his life. Six years before the Christmas gathering of the film, Henri faced bankruptcy. Elizabeth paid off his debts, but demanded that he never see her again, meaning he was excluded from family gatherings. Family members speculate on the reason for this condition, including perhaps incest between them. Just before Christmas, Junon learns she has leukemia and will soon die, unless she has a bone marrow transplant. Her family gathers at her home and immediately start bickering. Junon asks them to donate bone marrow. Elizabeth fights with Henri, who drinks heavily and hides Paul's medication. Paul fears the blood test might reveal his father is not his biological parent. Henri refuses the test, because he never loved his mother. Faunia has agreed to visit before leaving for her own family. Her honesty and gentleness soothe Henri, and she stays for two days. On 23 December, Rosaim√©e visits for dinner and fireworks. She was Abel's mother's friend, although it is suggested that they were lesbian lovers. Rosaim√©e tells Sylvia that Simon stopped seeing Sylvia because he believed she would be happier with Ivan. Sylvia feels betrayed and manipulated. Henri has the test and discovers he can donate. He decides to do so despite disliking his mother. Simon begins drinking heavily in cafes, and the family seeks him. Sylvia discovers him and confesses that she knows he loves her. She and Simon spend several hours talking, then return to the house and make love. Paul tells Henri about his fears. Henri convinces him that he is not his father, confirmed by the test, and reassures Paul that it is not a failing to be afraid. They bond, and Paul‚Äôs mental condition improves. On Christmas Day, Abel and Elizabeth discuss Elizabeth's longstanding depression, and Abel reads her the prologue to Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality about how well we know ‚Äì or don't know ‚Äì ourselves. Abel suggests that Elizabeth fears death, and that has led to her caution and depression. The film ends with Ivan discovering his wife has had sex with Simon (they make no effort to hide it, waking up together in bed and greeting her children as they come bearing tea), but the effect on him is not revealed ‚Äì he seems remarkably blase, as though he has expected it. Paul stays behind with Henri, who is having a positive effect on his mental health. Henri donates his bone marrow to Junon, but she announces, seemingly before medical evidence for it, that her body will reject the transplant. Elizabeth speculates that Junon will live, but Henri is shown flipping a coin in the hospital in front of his mother and not revealing the answer.
