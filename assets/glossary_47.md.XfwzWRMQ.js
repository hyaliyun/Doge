Kecap manis is widely used with satay. It is similar to, though finer in flavor than, Chinese sweet bean sauce (tianmianjiang). It is by far, the most popular type of soy sauce employed in Indonesian cuisine, accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the nation's total soy sauce production. Ingredients Compared to mildly salty regular soy sauce, the sweet soy sauce has a slightly thicker consistency, and tastes much sweeter. This condiment is made from a fermented paste of boiled black soybeans, roasted grain, salt, water and Aspergillus wentii molds, to which palm sugar is added. The strong sweet taste is contributed by a generous amount of palm sugar ‚Äî the sauce may contain up to 50 percent gula merah or gula jawa (palm sugar jaggery). Indonesian sweet soy sauce is often enriched with spices, including star anise, cinnamon, black pepper, coriander and clove. Uses Kecap manis is an essential sauce in the Indonesian pantry. It is used to add a pleasantly mild sweet and umami flavor in most popular Indonesian dishes; including nasi goreng, mie goreng, kwetiau goreng, ayam kecap (chicken), babi kecap (pork), semur beef stew, and ketoprak. It is also a popular marinade for grilled dishes, such as satay, ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and ikan bakar (grilled fish). Sweet soy sauce is also a popular dipping sauce, mixed with chopped shallot and bird's eye chili and served as dipping sauce to accompany tahu goreng (fried tofu). Steamed rice topped with sunny side fried egg and drizzled with sweet soy sauce is a simple yet popular meal among Indonesian children. In Eastern Indonesia, sweet soy sauce is used as the ingredient of colo-colo dipping sauce, although traditionally this Maluku sauce uses black colored rendered coconut oil residue.

Brands Bango brand, one of the popular kecap manis brands in Indonesia. In Indonesia there are large numbers of sweet soy sauce brands. Kecap manis is traditionally a small-scale home industry. However there are a handful of brands that are widely distributed throughout Indonesia and regionally, such as kecap manis ABC, , Indofood and Sedaap. There are also brands that distribute widely in the Netherlands like Conimex and Trade Mark A Substitutes Sweet soy sauce is widely available in Indonesian marketplaces, warungs, minimarkets, supermarkets, toko and Asian grocery stores worldwide. However, it is quite hard to find in most parts of Europe (except for the Netherlands and UK) and also quite scarce in the Americas. Sweet soy sauce can be made from regular soy sauce. Regular soy sauce mixed with brown sugar, added with a trace of molasses, can serve as a substitute for sweet soy sauce.

Forms 1042, 1042-S and 1042-T are United States Internal Revenue Service tax forms dealing with payments to foreign persons, including non-resident aliens, foreign partnerships, foreign corporations, foreign estates, and foreign trusts. Every withholding agent or intermediary, whether U.S. or foreign, who has control, receipt, custody, disposal or payment of any fixed or determinable, annual or periodic U.S. source income over foreign persons, must file these forms with the IRS. For example, employers that employ non-resident aliens (such as foreign workers or foreign students) would need to file a 1042-S Form with the IRS for every non-resident alien they employ and also send a (completed) copy of that form to the non-resident alien they employ. Forms 1042 and 1042-S are filed separately. The main difference between forms 1042 and 1042-S is that form 1042-S is concerned with payments made to foreign persons, while form 1042 is concerned with determining how much income will be withheld for tax withholding purposes. Also, Form 1042-S must always be filed together with Form 1042-T, but Form 1042 can be filed by itself.  Filing  = When are the forms due? = Forms 1042, 1042-S and 1042-T are due to be filed by March 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the income subject to reporting was paidhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/discussion-of- form-1042-and-form-1042s-and-form-1042t. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. These forms should be addressed to Ogden Service Center, P.O. BOX 409101, Ogden, UT 84409. = Penalties = If Form 1042 and/or Form 1042-S are filed late, or the tax isn't paid or deposited when due, the filer may be liable for penalties, unless they show that the failure to file or pay was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.  Form 1042  Form 1042, also \\"Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons\\", is used to report tax withheld on certain income of foreign persons. The employer only needs to submit Form 1042 to the IRS, not to their employee. Form 1042 does not have to be accompanied by a Form 1042-T.  Form 1042-S  Form 1042-S, also \\"Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding\\", is used to report any payments made to foreign persons. Non-resident alien employees receive a completed version of this form from their withholding agent if they have one. For example, a postdoctoral student from a foreign country who receives a stipend from an American university would receive Form 1042-S from the university, but if the person is receiving payment in exchange for work done (such as teaching duties), this would be reported on a Form W-2. It is possible for the same person to receive both forms in a given calendar year if the person's income comes from both types of sources. Note that a separate Form 1042-S must be filed for each type of income paid to the same recipient. If an employer needs to file 250 or more of Form 1042-S, then each Form 1042-S must be filed electronically with the IRS (though paper copies may still be given to the workers). = Withholding = Form 1042-S payments are subject to withholding. The withholding level is: * 14% for scholarships/fellowships if the payee is in F, J, M, or Q status and has a valid Taxpayer Identification Number, * 30% otherwise. = Comparison with Forms 1099 and 1099-MISC = Form 1099 is one of several IRS tax forms used to prepare and file an information return to report various types of income other than wages, salaries, and tips (for which Form W-2 is used instead). Form 1099-MISC is a variant of Form 1099 used to report miscellaneous income. As a general rule, if the person receiving the withholdable payment is a nonresident alien, Forms 1099 and 1099-MISC should not be used, and instead Form 1042-S should be used. One use of Form 1099 is for reporting gross rent on property. However, for example, if a property manager manages property owned by nonresident aliens, the manager must issue the nonresident alien owner a Form 1042-S, not a Form 1099. A common use of Form 1099-MISC is to report amounts paid by a business to a non- corporate US resident independent contractor for services. If the independent contractor is a nonresident alien, then the business must instead use Form 1042-S. It is important to note that Form 1042 is not merely the nonresident payee analogue of Form 1099. There are a few important differences: * Forms 1099 and 1099-MISC usually do not require any withholding, except in cases where the payee does not provide a correct Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), the payee has been reported for underpayment, or there has been a payee certification failure. In contrast, Form 1042-S is accompanied by tax withholding. * The various Form 1099s have reporting thresholds (for instance, Form 1099-MISC needs to be filed only if $600 or more is being paid). However, Form 1042-S needs to be filed for any payment. * There are contexts where no Form 1099 (or any other form) needs to be filed for resident payees, but Form 1042-S needs to be filed for nonresident payees. These include scholarship income, as well as payment for personal services (i.e. payment for services that fall outside a business‚àícontractor arrangement, such as payment for household help). = Comparison with Form W-2 = Form W-2 is issued for work done as an employee to all US citizens and residents and is issued to foreign employees who either don't fall under a tax treaty, or whose earnings exceed allowable maximums of a tax treaty.  Form 1042-T  Form 1042-T, also \\"Annual Summary and Transmittal of Forms 1042-S\\", is used to transmit Form 1042-S to the Internal Revenue Service. Form 1042-T is simply a 1-page summary of Form 1042-S. This form (along with Form 1042-S) is submitted to the IRS only, not to the non-resident alien. A separate Form 1042-T must accompany each type of Form 1042-S, but multiple Forms 1042-S (corresponding to more than one payee) can be grouped under a single Form 1042-T.

Works The true name of this writer is not known. He is identified as \\"Commentator Cruquianus\\" because his annotations were brought forth in an edition of Horace assembled by 16th-century Belgian scholar Jacques De Crucque‚Äîwho Latinized his given name to \\"Jacobus Cruquius\\"‚Äîfrom four manuscripts of Horace in the library of the monastery of St. Peter's Abbey, Ghent, or \\"Mont Blandin\\". These were the so-called \\"Blandinian manuscripts\\". All four manuscripts were later destroyed in a fire at the monastery in 1566, leaving Cruquius's edition the sole surviving record of this commentator. Cruquius published several separate volumes, and then one complete edition in 1578. He attributed to a single \\"Commentator Cruquianus\\" the anonymous annotations that he believed too good to be those of the other Horace scholiasts, Pomponius Porphyrion and Helenius Acron, about whom Cruquius had a very low opinion. After Cruquius's death these commentaries were published as a separate, standalone work, in 1611. The editions of Cruquius contain material that scholars consider unequivocally ancient, so it is believed Commentator Cruquianus significantly predates the 16th century. Debate Some scholars believe \\"Commentator Cruquianus\\" to be many scholiasts, not a single source. The value of the annotations themselves are debated as well; some critics rate them highly, while some believe that the scholiasts (Commentator Cruquianus among them) preserve little that isn't already present in the common manuscripts of Horace, and what they do preserve has been described as \\"fanciful guess-work\\" and \\"worthless\\", though some take a more sanguine view that the Commentator Cruquianus's works are useful if taken with \\"great reserve and caution\\".

During July and August 1941, it gave very effective service in the battles around Velikiye Luki until it was so severely depleted that it had to be disbanded. A new 170th was formed between December 1941 and January 1942. From this point the division had a distinguished but relatively uncomplicated combat path, fighting in the central part of the Soviet-German front. It was given credit for the liberation of Rechytsa in late 1943, and ended the war in the conquest of East Prussia.  1st Formation  The division was first organized at Sterlitamak in the Ural Military District in September 1939, based on a cadre from the 98th Rifle Division, as part of the major pre-World War II mobilization of the Red Army. The division was mostly composed of Bashkir soldiers and was commanded by Kombrig Tikhon Silkin. Division headquarters and most units were based at Sterlitamak. The 422nd Rifle and 512th Howitzer Regiments were at Belebey, and the 717th Rifle Regiment was at Davlekanovo. The 294th Light Artillery Regiment was based at Miass. On June 22, 1941, its main order of battle was as follows: * 391st Rifle Regiment * 422nd Rifle Regiment * 717th Rifle Regiment * 294th Light Artillery Regiment * 512th Howitzer Regiment * 210th Antitank BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p 84  Battle of Smolensk  As Operation Barbarossa began, the 170th was moving west from the Urals as part of 22nd Army's 62nd Rifle Corps, to take up positions in the vicinity of Polotsk and Vitebsk.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p 84David Stahel, Operation Barbarossa and Germany's Defeat in the East, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2009, map on p 238 The division defended Sebezh on the Latvian border. At the beginning of July, retreating Soviet troops came to Sebezh. On 3 July, German bombers destroyed the town. The 391st and 717th Rifle Regiment moved to the Kuznetsovka railway station, while the 422nd Rifle Regiment stayed in place. For two days, the division attempted to hold back advancing German troops. On 11 July, the division retreated to positions around Zamo≈õƒá station. On 13 July, the division was ordered to attack. The division was initially successful, pushing back German troops to Kuznetsovka station. However, the division was then forced to retreat back to Idritsa due to German superiority in both numbers and firepower. Around this time, Major General Silkin went missing and was presumed killed. Colonel Nikolai Laksin took command of the division. After taking Nevel on July 15, the German LVII Motorized Corps was ordered to capture Velikiye Luki. This isolated thrust by one panzer and one motorized division took the city on July 19, but Soviet counterattacks against the supply corridor, in part by the 170th from the west, forced the German forces to give up the city and retreat.Stahel, pp 260-61, and map on p 265 On 20 July, the division became part of the 51st Rifle Corps and moved to positions northwest of Nevel. The division was ordered to counterattack, but met strong resistance and was stopped in the area of Hamchino. The division was surrounded on part of the Leningrad Highway, known as the Nevel Pocket. The division attempted to break out at Begunovo and Zabolote. The division was forced to destroy equipment and suffered heavy losses in the encirclement. On 23 July, the remnants of the division reached the area of Lake Urai and took up defensive positions. The division was again forced to retreat and on 26 July moved to the Dokuhino area, where it absorbed the remnants of the 98th and 112th Rifle Divisions. On 28 August the division was reported as having just 300 men with \\"...no equipment, headquarters or staff\\". It was transferred to 24th Army in Reserve Front for rebuilding in September, but was far from complete when the Germans launched Operation Typhoon. It was surrounded with its army north of Spas-Demensk by 1 October, and was disbanded on 4 October, due to a shortage of equipment.  2nd Formation  A new 170th Rifle Division was formed at Molotov, once again in the Ural Military District, based on the 439th Rifle Division which was already forming up when re-designated.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p 99Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p 68 The order of battle remained mostly the same, with the following additions: * 286th Antiaircraft Battalion * 134th Reconnaissance Battalion * 182nd Sapper Battalion * 210th Signal Battalion The howitzer regiment had been removed, and the standard artillery regiment retained the number of the original light regiment. In February 1942, the division was deployed to the west, into the 58th Army of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and in April it deployed to the front lines in the 34th Army of Northwestern Front. The 170th took part in the fighting around the Demyansk Pocket during the rest of 1942, either under command of the 34th or the 11th Army. In January 1943, it was reassigned to the 27th Army, and in March was once again in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding and a redeployment to the south.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p 68 By the beginning of June, the 170th was assigned to the Central Front in the Kursk salient. The division joined the 48th Army, and remained there for the duration, with the exception of a few months in early 1944.  Advance  In January, 1944, the division became part of the 42nd Rifle Corps, where it would remain for the duration. Belorussian Front was renamed 1st Belorussian in February. During the Soviet summer offensive, Operation Bagration, the 42nd Corps was concentrated north of Rogachev to assist its partner 29th Rifle Corps and units of the 3rd Army to break through the positions of the German 134th and 296th Infantry Divisions. By late on June 24 this had been achieved, with the Germans overwhelmed and the 9th Tank Corps exploiting to the rear. With the defenses of Army Group Center shattered, the division trekked westward towards Poland. 48th Army was transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front in the late autumn of 1944. During the Vistula-Oder Offensive the 170th pushed on through northern Poland before the army was once again transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front. The division fought in the East Prussian Offensive, and ended the war near Elbing.Sharp, p 70 Five men of the division were named as Heroes of the Soviet Union, two of them posthumously. At the end of the war the men and women of the division carried the full title 170th Rifle, Rechytsa, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division.

There are several players included in operations at the STORC including Sacramento State's Risk Management, the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS), and two professors in the Environmental Studies department Brook Murphy and Dudley Burton. The STORC facility is primarily maintained by California State University, Sacramento student interns and volunteers who use applied science and technology to address real world policy, food, health, and energy issues of present-day society. Research at the STORC encompasses engineering and science to test and evaluate new ideas and approaches of sustainable technology to solve environmental problems. Faculty and students address sustainability with an interdisciplinary studies approach. The STORC Vision is to become \\"an international resource for practical, scalable, and financially viable solutions in the area of sustainable technologies that are suitable for private and/or public sector operations related to the management of energy, food, water, and waste\\". The STORC Mission is \\"to demonstrate the operation of innovative commercially viable physical systems that are underpinned by sustainable technologies, and to disseminate the associated plans, public policy discourse, and scientific findings\\".  Project purposes  Projects at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center are developed as a closed-loop production system. Organic waste acquired from campus eateries is purposefully diverted from landfills where it is then incorporated and processed through several STORC projects turned into high quality protein used to feed fish and plants.  MTSS  STORC successfully operates an almost entirely closed-loop, Multi- Trophic Sustainable System that gathers food waste and introduces it into Compost and Vermicompost systems to produce high protein sources of food for a variety of fish. These fish then produce growth-limiting nutrients necessary for vegetable fertilization. These vegetables and other items are grown at STORC and consumed locally. Produce is also fertilized by use of Compost tea, a liquid solution of concentrated compost nutrients. The food waste that enters this system is gathered exclusively from restaurants and cafes on the Sacramento State campus. The two main locations on campus that STORC receives their food donations from are Epicure, a restaurant and catering company that specialized in their fresh food, and the Campus Commons, the restaurant that produces fresh food for Sacramento State dormitory inhabitants, students, and guests. The food waste collected considered pre-consumer waste, which is a component of Pre-consumer recycling, where the waste is recycled and never reaches the consumer. Food waste collected from Epicure and the Campus Commons is collected in specialized bins in the kitchens, during food production, then set aside for collection by STORC.  Funding  As of 2016, the facility is funded by an EPA grant funding its sustainable closed-loop food production system. Waste diversion efforts at Sacramento State University are funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). $15,000 was awarded to fund the aquaponic project at the STORC. Grant funds have been used to research sustainable food growing practices at the STORC while at the same time facilitating the production of vegetables that are distributed to several CSUS campus restaurants.  STORC projects  thumbSustainable produce grown by students involved in the aquaponics project at the STORC. 400x400px 400x400px = Aquaponics = STORC aquaponic's project focuses on the Urban Agriculture Method studying how to reduce water use and space needed to grow food in an urban setting. The goal of the aquaponic system at the facility is to gather detailed quantitative and operational parameters creating an example for other aquaponic systems to reference. Nutrient, reproductive, feeding, and environmental factors required by traditional aquaponic systems are addressed as well as pest and disease control strategies. The STORC is developing renewable systems to monitor operational controls such as water and air temperature, air circulation, and data collection. Other objectives of these systems include addressing problems in urban, industrial, and agriculture settings to ascertain knowledge needed to scale-up aquaponic systems that are both cost effective and efficient. = Biodiesel production system = The Biodiesel production system (BPS) located at the STORC was initiated by a collaboration between Sacramento State's Risk Management Services (RMS) and the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) to convert kitchen waste oil into biodiesel to power equipment used by Facilities Management to maintain Sacramento State's campus. Studies suggest many benefits of biodiesel production compared to traditional petroleum diesel production.Biodiesel Benefits and Considerations Domestically produced biodiesel is suggested to be an energy secure renewable substitute that is cost effective when compared to petroleum based diesel with benefits including clean air emissions, and improved engine operations. Biodeisel can be produced in large quantities,Environmental, economic, and energetic costs and benefits of biodiesel and ethanol biofuels producing 4.5 units of energy per unit of fossil energy.Comparison of the performance and emissions of different biodiesel blends against petroleum diesel Biodeisel produced at the STORC is biodegradable, non-toxic, and highly oxygenated improving engine combustion efficiencies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center trained students convert used vegetable oil from campus eateries into biodiesel that Facilities Management will then use to maintain campus grounds. Trained interns filter, titrate, process, and purify the kitchen waste oil into biodiesel where it can then be poured into a diesel fuel tank with no alteration to the engine. = Vermiculture = Vermiculture at the STORC encompasses a seven steps program to convert campus food and landscape waste into high quality compost.Vermiculture, STORC Pre-consumer food waste and landscape collected on campus is broken down into smaller material allowing a faster decomposition rate as breaking down the material lessens surface area. Waste is combined into a pile and heated to 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit. The process takes five days allowing microbes to break down weed seeds and pathogens. The microbes begin to break the material down. After the first five days the pile is mixed and heated once again to 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit. The pathogens are now gone and the compost is ready to be utilized by the annelids in the system. The material is then added to the annelid bin where the material will be processes multiple times. The worms eat and reproduce, while this is happening material passes through the tract of the annelids and increases microbial content. When managed and harvested correctly the worm supply is sustainable. After the material passes several times through the annelids tract the material and annelids are separated. Annelids are added to a new compost pile or fed to fish in the aquaponics projects. The Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center currently fosters several insects such as Annelids, black soldier flies, and terrestrial Isopoda: Armadillidium vulgare, Porcellio laevis, Porcellio scaber. = Composting = Composting is the process of taking organic solid waste, like food, paper and landscaping waste and allowing it to be broken down by microorganisms, creating a nutrient rich fertilizer to be used in food production or in landscaping. Once organic waste is placed in a pile, millions of microorganisms come from the soil to help break down the food waste. There are different types of microorganisms that are found in compost piles, depending on the temperature and pH of the compost pile, which can be determined by the types of waste introduced to the compost pile. In the beginning phase, mesophilic bacteria jump-start the decomposition process by breaking down all of the most easily decompostable material, raising the temperature to a level that the next phase of microorganisms thrive in. In the next phase of decomposition, thermophilic microorganisms further break down fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. It is during this thermophilic phase that temperatures inside of a compost pile can reach above 60 ¬∞C, killing most human pathogens that may have been introduced. Once the maximum temperature has been reached, the thermophilic microorganisms tend to slow down and are replaced with more mesophilic bacteria, which continue organic breakdown. During these phases larger organisms like flies, mites and beetles also aid in the breakdown of organic matter. The time it takes for fresh organic waste to be completely decomposed is dependent on multiple factors: microorganisms present, water content, oxygen content, and surrounding air temperature, for example. STORC operates two different compost locations, one on the STORC grounds, and one other location on the Sacramento State campus. STORC student interns and volunteers pick up discarded food waste from campus eateries daily and deliver it to both of the composting facilities. Due to the amount of waste diverted from landfills to these compost piles, hundreds of pounds of compost is ready or in the process of becoming ready for various uses. Compost is used to feed and shelter worms in vermiculture bins at STORC, which are then used to feed fish inside of the aquaponics systems. The compost is also used as a main ingredient in STORC- made compost tea, which in turn is used to fertilize plants grown in the aquaponics systems. All compost tea made at Sacramento State is made from steeping STORC compost with molasses and other ingredients to produce an ultra-concentrated liquid fertilizer. = Aquaculture = While many commercial aquaponics systems use fish that can easily be sold for food, the species used at STORC were not chosen with that consideration in mind. CSUS Biology professor Dr. Ron Coleman was a consultant for STORC as they were choosing the specific types of fish species they would be using in the aquaponics systems. Carp, catfish, bass, bluegill, and Sacramento perch are all common fish species that are found in the numerous aquaponic tanks at STORC. All of these species were chosen for their native status in the Western United States and due to the ease at which they grow in captivity. In an effort to repopulate an endangered species, STORC contains a system inhabited by Sacramento perch. The perch existence as STORC is considered a restoration effort, due to their endangered status granted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Commonly used in California aquaponics systems, once grown and released, the Perch ideally thrive and add new genetic diversity to existing populations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta area. Studies have shown that when raised in captivity, Perch tend to prefer to eat mosquito larvae, which could potentially aid in the reduction of diseases spread by mosquitoes. Catfish are very easy to keep in captivity, since they tend to thrive in warmer climates, like the Mediterranean climate of Sacramento. = Hydroponics = Hydroponics is the process of growing plants in nutrient-rich water, without the use of soil. At STORC, the largest hydroponics systems not involving aquaculture is used to grow plant seedlings. Nearly all plants grown at STORC begin in the seedling hydroponics system and remain there in labeled PVC pipe halves until they are large enough to be transplanted into the larger aquaponics beds, taking the place of fully mature plants that are ready for harvesting. In this specific hydroponics system, nutrient-rich water is slowly trickled into a series of PVC pipe halves, where seedlings are starting to take root to small pebbles. These pipes are angled slightly down so that the nutrient-rich water can be recycled and not lost immediately to the Hydrologic Cycle. All plants grown in aquaponics beds at STORC begin in these containers, as transplanting these seedlings from soil to a non-soil environment would be a detriment to the entire system. STORC's largest crop are its lettuces, but strawberries and herbs are also very commonly found growing. = Energy technology = Wind power is generated by a wind tower located at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center. The wind tower was installed during the winter 2015-2016 intersession. = Water technology: Engineered soils = The California State Water Resources Control Board currently funds the Engineered Soils project at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center. This project was implemented at the STORC to initiate engineered soil designs for local public agencies to reduce issues relating to Low-Impact Development. Storm water runoff can carry harmful pollutants impacting wildlife, vegetation, recreational areas, and drinking water. Low Impact Development (LID) is an approach to minimized storm water pollution keeping runoff close to source. Efforts at the STORC include engineering soil designs to reduce barriers associated with Low Impact Development such as nutrient export issues, groundwater contamination, and information regarding treatment of pollutants is lacking.  Engineering initiatives  Sustainable engineering projects at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center focus on technology and building designs that will support sustainable food systems in an urban setting. Sacramento State University interns, volunteers, and engineering students work together to designs and construct sustainable projects with the goal of reducing cost, energy, and space required to grow sustainable protein sources. Engineered systems at the STORC include the Biodiesal Production, aquaponics, vermiculture, compost, and greenhouse systems.  Why the STORC  The Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center at Sacramento State University addresses future food security problems associated with global climate variation. Globally, sustainable technology and agricultural questions are being address. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America published an article estimating that food demands will increase 100-110% by 2050, adding that the environmental impact of this kind of agriculture expansion may be large, depending on the type of expansion that occurs. The Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center specifically addresses viable technology and growing practices that would conserve land, reduce amount of land used, and grow healthy sustainable food in the future. Initiatives at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center address issues such as urban growth and the development of sustainable food growing practices that could be implemented in an urban setting where there is a large food demand and little land to grow. Those working and researching at the STORC. address social, economic, and environmental aspects relating to food demand and the potential of climate variability in the future.  Educational and interdisciplinary aspects of research  300x300px The Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center is primarily ran by Sacramento State Students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds including Economics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Government, and Environmental Studies. The educational experience students and visitors receive reflect California State University, Sacramento curriculum of sustainability concepts and practices, water quality and conservation, energy conversion, urban agriculture and aquaponics, and organic and sustainable food production procedures and concepts.  STORC and the community  The Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center has partnered with community interest groups such as the Sacramento Food Bank for outreach to underserved communities, Luther Burbank High School located in South Sacramento, local urban agriculture organizations, and Keep California Beautiful. The STORCs initiatives to outreach to the community had increased media coverage and governmental communities. Weekly community and youth tours are given at the Sustainable Technology Optimization Research Center. Tours are led by faculty members and students involved at the STORC and aim to teach the community the relevance of the STORC and how each project works and contributes to the MTSS closed loop system.

It was the second National Scout Jamboree held at the Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia. The theme of the jamboree was \\"Live Scouting's Adventure\\". The Summit was also the venue of the 24th World Scout Jamboree in 2019. It was decided at the 2013 National Jamboree that the Summit Bechtel Reserve would be the permanent location of each National Jamboree. The gold-rimmed patch for staff Changes from 2013 After the most recent jamboree in 2013, BSA leadership underwent a feedback process to determine how they could improve on the Summit jamboree experience, and made changes as a result. =Communication= Seeing communication with staff and participants as one of the program's biggest hurdles, the jamboree leadership consolidated former forms of media, such as Jamboree Today and Leader's Update, into a single organization, known as JamboLink. JamboLink covered mass email communication leading up to and during the event, social media, live video streaming, and all exclusive content created for the jamboree. Wait times for popular program areas, such as ziplining and mountain biking, was available online as well as in the jamboree app, powered by AT&T; in real time. To accommodate a greater need and ability to stay connected, the amount of charging stations at the Summit was doubled. =Staff experience= Some staff members at the 2013 jamboree complained about unpleasant facets of the volunteer experience. In a Reddit AMA, an Order of the Arrow trek guide recalled very long workdays with no break time, very long walks to program locations, and general understaffing. In response, the BSA announced changes to make staffing the jamboree more enjoyable. Eleven bus routes carried staff members around the reserve, stopping at the staff base camp, various program areas, and participant base camps. To address complaints about uncomfortably cold ambient showers, staff members had access to solar-heated showers in their base camp. Staff members received the equivalent of a full day off in their work schedules, and have the ability to visit other program areas on a day-to-day basis. =Service expansion= During the 2013 jamboree, the first at the Summit, participating contingents were given the opportunity to complete a \\"Messengers of Peace Day of Service,\\" taking them outside the Summit to one of nine West Virginia counties to work on a community service project. In conjunction with the Citizens Conservation Corps and the Boy Scouts of America, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced an expansion of the initiative, titled \\"West Virginia Arrow to the Summit.\\" Service projects during the Jamboree were expanded to all 55 counties within the state. The initiative was expected to create over 500 projects with an estimated economic impact of $7 million. =Food markets= The Jamboree switched from a fixed menu to a grocery store concept, which gave troops choices on what to eat. Scouts used a mobile app to download recipes, build shopping lists, and check out of the store. Presidential visit Donald Trump's speech at the National Scout Jamboree On July 24, 2017, President Donald Trump visited the National Jamboree, making him the eighth sitting president to do so. During his speech, Trump boasted about his 2016 electoral victory, criticized former U.S. President Barack Obama, former opponent Hillary Clinton, and the media, and he related an anecdote about real estate developer William Levitt, a yacht, and a cocktail party. Trump's partisan speech marked a sharp break from past tradition; every other president to speak at the Scout Jamboree in its 80 years of existence addressed purely nonpartisan themes, such as citizenship, public service, and civic engagement. Trump's speech was met with criticism that the Jamboree was an inappropriate venue for campaigning. The backlash prompted multiple scouts from around the country to make statements to various media groups (including BBC and The Washington Post) such as Jarren Cook, a scout from West Virginia, and David Wolfe Bender, a scout from Indiana. On July 27, Chief Scout Executive Michael B. Surbaugh released a statement apologizing for politics being \\"inserted into the Scouting program\\". Referring to the speech, Trump stated in a July 25, 2017 interview in The Wall Street Journal that \\"I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful\\". However, the Scouts stated to the Associated Press on August 2, 2017, that \\"[they were] unaware of any such call\\". Entertainment Since both planned headline musical acts in 2013, Train and Carly Rae Jepsen, pulled out of their commitments in advance due to public criticism for supporting the BSA, jamboree leadership had elected not to announce its 2017 headliners before they stepped onstage. Saturday's opening \\"Celebration of Scouting Show\\" featured rock band X Ambassadors, whose lead singer Sam Harris made pointed comments about the President's upcoming visit. Country musician Jessie Chris, of Disney fame, performed after Trump's speech on Monday, and the Plain White T's played Thursday's closing show.

It is not clear where Mazandaran was located ‚Äì various places have been suggested. Some scholars believe that Mazandaran was a region in India, others believe that Mazandaran is in the Levant or Egypt, but there is no consensus between scholars.  In the Shahnameh  In the Shahnameh, Mazandaran is the land of great Divs (demons). It is such a horrible place that no Shah of Iran dared to go there to conquer the land. One day, a Div came to Kai Kavus to read a poem for him to describe the beauties of Mazandaran. Being impressed by the Div's description, Kai Kavus, who is an irrational and unwise man, decides to conquer Mazandaran. Everyone is opposed to this decision, because even great kings such as Jamshid and Fereydun wouldn't try to conquer the land. Nonetheless, Kai Kavus insists upon it. He goes there, but is defeated and imprisoned by the Divs of the area. He and two-thirds of his army are blinded by the Divs. He writes a letter to ZƒÅl to ask him to come and rescue him, but ZƒÅl is old and can't go. Instead, he sends Rostam, who is a child. Rostam has to pass Haft Khan in order to get to Mazandaran. Prior to the above, there are some references to Mazandaran, in the story of ZƒÅl and Rudaba. It seems that SƒÅm, the grandfather of Rostam, had conquered Mazandaran at the time of Manuchehr. Mazandaran was inhabited by a population that was different from other Iranians. They didn't believe in God, and instead they were magicians; and for this reason, they could not be defeated by man's power, only God's power could defeat them.

The decision for non-re-election to the Portuguese Parliament came from PSD-Madeira's president, Miguel Albuquerque, and the regional party's Political Commission as result from the negotiations made with PSD regarding the Closed lists. =Political views=  LGBT rights  Contrary to the mainstream ideology of her party, Rubina Berardo voted in favour of LGBT adoption and surrogacy during her term as member of the Portuguese parliament.  Abortion  Despite her stance on certain civil rights, Rubina has been a member of pro-life movement throughout her political career, having supported the movement \\"Sociedade Civil da Madeira Junta pela Vida\\" (Madeira Civil Society Unite for Life) in Madeira which campaigned No in the Portuguese abortion referendum in 2007.  Euthanasia  Following the proposals submitted, In February 2020, by left- wing (PAN, Left Block, Socialists and Greens) and liberal (IL) parties to the Assembly of the Republic on the legalization of euthanasia Berardo published an opinion article in JM-Madeira highly criticizing such proposals. In accordance with her Lutheran and pro-life background and beliefs, Berardo argued that the parties involved in these proposals are forcing their own agendas on the issue and failing the promises made of more civil society debates after these proposals failed parliamentary approval in 2018. She further questioned that parties' proposal regarding what is the precise moment when they consider that someone gives up their human dignity and thus must be subject to the process of euthanasia, because society, medicine and the state have failed such individual. In her view such moment does not exist since human dignity is inalienable.  European Union affairs  Berardo advocates for Portugal's further integration in the European Union, while an increasing Madeira's political autonomy from the Portuguese central government. As a federalist she believes that social-economic development in Portugal is only achievable by giving regions more political power, instead of centralizing political power in Lisbon.  Foreign affairs  Berardo, again not following party's voting policy, became the only PSD member of parliament joining left-wing parties PAN, Left Block, Socialists and Greens on the vote condemning Equatorial Guinea, a member of CPLP, for \\"mantaining and applying death penalty\\". = \\"Double Subsidy\\" affair = April 2017, Portuguese media denounced the fact the parliamentarians representing the Autonomous Regions were benefiting from a duplication of subsidies to cover their air fare costs. Parliamentarians representing Madeira and Azores were entitled not only to benefit from the subsidy available to all tax residents of the Autonomous Regions, as well as to benefit from the subsidy made available by the Portuguese Parliament to cover transportation costs. Unlike most of her colleagues, benefiting from the double subsidy, Rubina Berardo made clear to the press that she never applied for the subsidy made available to tax residents, since it was her understanding that the subsidy provided by the Portuguese parliament is more than enough to cover the air fare costs relating to the travels to her constituency. Out of the 12 Parliamentarians representing the Autonomous Region, Rubina Berardo, was the only one to opt to apply for one, of the two, available subsidies. Columnist Since her involvement in politics, Berardo has contributed as pundit for Portuguese magazines and newspapers such as S√°bado, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, Di√°rio de Not√≠cias da Madeira and JM-Madeira. Personal life Rubina holds dual citizenship, from Portugal and (Germany). She is mother to only one son, from her previous marriage, Ben. Her mother, Ilse Berardo, is a German Lutheran theologian, responsible for the German-speaking Protestant Church on Madeira and her uncle Joe Berardo, a Portuguese businessman, stock investor, and art collector, is one of the wealthiest people in Portugal.

History Soldiers of Odin was founded in the town of Kemi in Northern Finland in October 2015 in response to an almost ten- fold increase in the number of migrants to Finland following the European migrant crisis in 2015. The founder is Mika Ranta, who, while a self-declared neo-Nazi and member of the Finnish Resistance Movement, maintains that his personal views do not represent the group as a whole. The group is named after Odin, the god that rules Asgard, home of the gods, in Norse mythology. Soldiers of Odin gained momentum in 2016 after incidents such as the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, the January 2016 stabbing death of Alexandra Mezher, a Lebanese social worker in Sweden, and other migrant- related crime incidents. On 15 March 2016, Soldiers of Odin announced on their Facebook page that they had intervened in the attempted sexual harassment of two underage girls. The group also claimed that the perpetrators were two refugees and that the police thanked Soldiers of Odin for their actions. Further investigation revealed that neither the police nor any bystanders had any knowledge of the event. On March 16, 2016, Soldiers of Odin admitted that one of their members fabricated the story. The group apologized for the announcement and said that the member would be expelled.Soldiers of Odin my√∂nt√§√§: Ahdistelutarina oli l√∂√∂peri√§ - \\"Pyyd√§mme kaikilta anteeksi\\", Iltalehti 16 March 2016.

According to Yle, Soldiers of Odin has connections to the Finnish MV-media alternative media website and has been promised good visibility on the site. MV-media website and its owner Ilja Janitskin have ties to the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic. Presence outside Finland Soldiers of Odin claims a membership of 600 in Finland. The group also has a presence in Sweden and Norway; however, the Norwegian prime minister condemns the group. The group has a presence in Estonia even though Estonia \\"has almost no asylum seekers or refugees\\". Additionally, Soldiers of Odin has a following in the United States, Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Qu√©bec and New Brunswick), England, Belgium,Portugal and Germany.Vigilantes begin patrols in Norway amid migrant influx, Associated Press (February 15, 2016).Janis Laizans & Joachim Dagenborg, Anti-immigrant 'Soldiers of Odin' expand from Finland to Nordics, Baltics, Reuters (March 2, 2016).Soldiers of Odin USA: The Extreme European Anti-Refugee Group Comes to America, Anti-Defamation League (2016).Ben Makuch, Soldiers of Odin: Inside the extremist vigilante group that claims to be preserving Canadian values, VICE News (February 1, 2017).DBA, Wie zijn de Soldiers of Odin, de 'risicobeweging' die onze Staatsveiligheid zorgen baart? De Morgen, 03 aug. 2016 = Australia = The membership of the Soldiers of Odin Australia was registered as a non-profit association with the Victorian government in June 2016. In 2016, the group ran \\"safety patrols\\" of Federation Square, Birrarung Marr and Bourke Street Mall and outside city train stations at night in Melbourne, Victoria to counteract what it claims was the inability of police to protect the public from rising street crime and gangs such as Apex. However, the group has not been publicly active since. =Canada= The Quebec chapter of Soldiers of Odin was established by Dave Tregget, who left to found the anti-immigration group Storm Alliance in 2016. Soldiers of Odin established a group in Yukon, Canada, in 2016. Soldiers of Odin were seen patrolling the streets of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in July 2016. The group told the police that they were not \\"anti-immigration\\", and the police confirmed the group had not engaged in any criminal activity as of September 2016. The Edmonton police did say that \\"If they are the Soldiers of Odin like they are in Europe, we are going to be very concerned\\". A soldiers of Odin group began patrols in Grande Prairie, Alberta, where they not only patrol but are involved in helping the community in a variety of ways, including sending children to summer camps and helping to restore a vandalized war monument. The Grande Prairie chapter's Facebook describes them as \\"Soldiers of Odin is a charitable non-profit organization in Grand Prairie Alberta, with an eye on the community and helping hands for those in need\\". In 2019, the group was banned from holding events at the city's chapter of the Royal Canadian Legion, after a directive was issued by the national command. A Soldiers of Odin group began patrols in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in September 2016 but claimed to be independent and not affiliated with racist and biker groups. A chapter also appeared in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in fall 2016, though they also claimed to be unaffiliated with the European groups. The national chapter is based in Gimli, Manitoba. An educator at MacEwan University counters their claims of non-hate stating \\"Why name yourself after that group, then, if you don't want to be associated with that ideology? If you truly are interested in community safety, community patrols, there's more than enough volunteer organizations that could have been joined.\\" A chapter of the Soldiers of Odin formed in Sudbury, Ontario, in summer 2016, around the same time that the leader of the Finnish Soldiers of Odin was sentenced for aggravated assault. Members soon began volunteering at a local soup kitchen and cleaning up discarded needles in public parks and trails and posting photos of their efforts on social media in an attempt to recruit new members. Following outcry from Sudbury Against Fascism, they were banned from the soup kitchen. In August 2017, Soldiers of Odin were serving hamburgers at a dedication ceremony for organ donors when Chief Paul Pedersen of the City of Greater Sudbury Police Service posed for a photo with them. Popular backlash against the chief associating with the SOO resulted in a swift apology from the chief in which he said, \\"This photo should in no way be interpreted as support for this group.\\" A chapter appeared in Sault Ste. Marie in September 2016. A spokesperson for the group said the 11 members would conduct drug needle collection patrols in the city and provide security to a social worker whose work took them into risky areas after dark. On 26 March 2017, Soldiers of Odin members clashed with protesters and police at an anti-racism rally in Vancouver, British Columbia. Several were led away in handcuffs after fights broke out. Joel Angott, the president of Soldiers of Odin Canada, has said that his group supports \\"sustainable immigration\\". The Northern Guard that came up in 2017 are also an offshoot of the Soldiers of Odin according to the Canadian Anti-Hate Network. =Norway= The group began patrolling in Norway in February 2016. which was profiled temporarily in the start-up phase by , a former leader of the Norwegian Defence League and Pegida activist. Among the 14 members several are known members of the extreme far-right and have criminal records. They were opposed by Osebergskipets venner who turned up dressed as vikings as a protest against the misuse of traditional symbols. =Sweden= The group in Sweden have many members who are Nazis and are convicted of serious crimes. Several are sentenced for assaulting women. The Swedish chapter is headed by Mikael Johansson earlier a member of Nationaldemokraterna. The group began patrols in Sweden in March 2016, marching in several cities and towns, however they met with opposition groups and in Gothenburg they themselves had to ask the police for protection of their patrols.  Reception  The Finnish National Police Commissioner, , caused confusion when he initially welcomed the establishment of street patrols. In response, the Minister of the Interior, Petteri Orpo, said, \\"In Finland it is officials who oversee and take care of order in society. It is a simple matter and we will stick to it.\\" Finnish Security Intelligence Service regards the group as unsettling. Norwegian police initially expressed mixed reactions to the group, with some departments announcing that they would send marching members away, while others said the group was unproblematic. It caused some controversy when Progress Party MP and spokesperson for justice Jan Arild Ellingsen applauded the establishment of the group, saying they should be \\"praised\\". Government and party leaders quickly distanced themselves from his comments, stating public security to be the responsibility of the police. The Estonian Prime Minister, Taavi R√µivas, criticized the group saying, \\"In the Republic of Estonia law and order is enforced by the Estonian police. Self-proclaimed gangs do not increase the Estonian people's sense of security in any way; rather the opposite.\\" Trademark In spring 2016, the Finnish Patent and Registration Office accepted a request to register \\"Soldiers of Odin\\" as a trademark for clothes, footwear and headgear. The owner of the trademark, however, has no connection to the vigilante street patrol group, and is using her brand as a statement against racism and to bring the authorities' decision to accept Soldiers of Odin as a registered organization into question.

He was born in the city of Mesen some time before 1520. Life Little is known about his early life, though we know he enrolled in the Universit√© catholique de Louvain on August 29, 1532. He received the degree of magister artium on February 18, 1535. He afterwards studied law, also at Louvain, and graduated with a licentiatus degree some time thereafter. While he was studying law he also took courses with renowned humanists Conrad Goclenius and Petrus Nannius at the Collegium Trilingue. In 1542, Crucque was teaching Latin in a convent in Leuven. He applied for a job to replace Nannius in his teaching position, which did not come to pass, but in doing so he came to the attention of theologian George Cassander, who recommended Crucque as his successor for his own teaching position in Bruges, which Crucque did in fact take on. Crucque taught in this position from February 8, 1543, until his death on June 22, 1584. Crucque became a prominent intellectual in Bruges, on account of his large collection of books, as well as his collection of ancient coins. As a teacher he taught many notable humanists of the age, including Jacobus Raevardus, Lucas Fruterius, Victor Giselinus, Janus Lernutius, and Franciscus Modius. Crucque died in Bruges. Work Cruquius is primarily known from his editions of the lyric poet Horace assembled from four ancient manuscripts in the library of the Benedictine monastery of St. Peter's Abbey, Ghent, or \\"Mont Blandin\\". These were the so-called \\"Blandinian manuscripts\\". All four manuscripts were later destroyed in a fire at the monastery in 1566, leaving Cruquius's edition the sole surviving record of a number of commentaries not otherwise known, such as from the so-called \\"Commentator Cruquianus\\". Of special interest is Cruquius's access to an extremely rare and ancient manuscript of Horace now referred to as V, variously known otherwise as Blandinius, Blandinius vetustissimus, or codex antiquissimus Blandinianus. Cruquius published several separate volumes of this work from 1565 to 1578‚Äîthe first with Hubertus Goltzius then all the remainder with Christopher Plantin‚Äîand then one complete edition in 1578, and ultimately a standalone edition of Commentator Cruquianus's scholia. After Cruque's death, the editions were reprinted in 1597 with a small collection of notes from Janus Dousa the Elder. Modern scholars have a somewhat dubious opinion of the merit of these works, but these editions were quite successful in their time. And even today virtually all rare book collections in Western Europe will hold at least one copy of one of Cruque's editions, either in an original printing or one of the expanded versions from 1597.

Subsequent to Cooke's expedition, Forty-niners and later travelers used the route proposed by him, from the Jornada del Muerto across San Diego Crossing then 17 miles to a camp on the river with a cutoff to his route near the future site of Fort Thorn. From there it was then 8 miles up a dry arroyo then 4 miles on rolling hills to \\"the water\\" (Fosters Hole). : Benjamin Ignatius Hayes, coming down the Rio Grande from the north described Fosters Hole when he camped there on his way to California in November, 1849: : \\"Tuesday, 20th: In about 12 miles the appearance of the country strongly indicated that we were soon to bid farewell to the river. At several points plain wagon tracks Seemed to lead off. At length we made a turn toward the hills, hardly perceiving our destination at first, winding up a long ca√±on of gentle ascent, in general; descending again into a wide bottom; thence over a rolling country covered with grana, and at the end of 24 miles from the morning's camp we entered a little cove to the right of the road, where Capt. C. had already found water; abundant grass on the hillsides; fuel, a little mezquite and stalks of the Spanish bayonet. This is \\"Foster's Hole,\\" described by Col. Cooke as \\"a natural rock-bound wall, thirty feet in diameter and twenty-four feet deep, containing about 55,000 gallons of clear, pure water.\\" : \\"From our camp it can be approached through a narrow opening in the rocks, but the mules are driven over the hills on either side down into the chasm, where they can be watered one or two at a time in two small basins at the foot of the main one, some 15 or 20 feet below it. The process is a long one but easy enough. We had also found abundant water in a large pond on the roadside, three miles from the river. Day clear and pleasant. Our camp was Within a mile of the table-land that stretches, almost without interruption a level plain, to Guadalupe Pass. Ascending from the river, the mountain scenery is various, striking, and grand, comprehending a view of the Organos and El Paso mountains.

In 1853, Fort Thorn was built between where the roads left the Rio Grande for Fosters Hole, and the town of Santa Barbara was built nearby southeast of the fort.  Subsequent Decrease in Use, Abandoned and Forgoten  When a shortcut was built between the crossing of the Rio Grande at Mesilla and Cooke's Spring, as part of the Pacific Wagon Road military road construction project in 1856, wagon traffic soon diminished on the longer route by way of San Diego Crossing.

The reserve is one of the oldest and smallest nature reserves in Russia, first formed in 1924 but reorganized several times since. It is on the southwestern slope of the Central Hills on the western edge of Russia. The reserve is situated in the Belgorodsky District of Belgorod Oblast. The reserve was created in 1935, and covers an area of . Topography The Belogorye Reserve is actually a collection of five separate sectors that are 10 to 75 km apart. The western two are in the basin of the Dnieper River, the other two in the basin of the Don River. * \\"Worskla Forest\\" (1,038 ha), a forested section near the village of Borisov, 30 km west of Belgorod. Upland oak forest, surrounded on three sides by the Vorskla River. * \\"Ostrasevy\\" (90 ha), a network of gullies and ravines, 3 km long and 200‚Äì300 meters wide, along Gostenki River, with forb meadow steppe vegetation on 45 degree slopes, and 35 species of rare and vulnerable steppe plants. * \\"Bald Mountain\\" (170 hectares, with a 1 km security buffer) and \\"Yamskaya Steppe\\" (Tselinnaya feather-forb steppes), near the town of Stary Oskol. Black-soil slopes over limestone create a complex soil terrain that supports a scientifically important botanical site: over 570 species of vascular plants are found in a very small area. * \\"Izgorya Walls\\" (267 ha), a notable limestone formation of chalk hills near Novooskolsky, on the Oskol River. Very complex terrain and soil habitats in a very small area supporting 710 species of vascular plants. The overall clusters is on the southwestern edge of the Central Highlands, about 650 km south of Moscow, with two of the sectors are about 15 km from the border with Ukraine. Izgorya Walls The terrain sits on Cretaceous deposits of limestone; the resulting karst topography is one of ravines, hills, and caves which appear as \\"steppe saucers\\" on the surface. Elevations range between 100 meters to 230 meters above sea level. Climate and Ecoregion Belogorye is located in the East European forest steppe ecoregion, a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south.. This ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The average temperature in January +8.1 C, and in July +19.9 C. The climate of Belogorye is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Flora and fauna The Forest on the Vorskla sector is over 20 meters above the water table, lower than the tree roots can reach, so the forest is an upland community depending on precipitation: English oak, European ash, Norway maple, small-leaved lime, and Ulmus glabra. The old-growth forest is particularly important for the 60-70 nesting species of birds, over half which are Passerine (perching songbirds), with many that dwell in shrubs and hollow trees.

The Belgorye Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. For the public, guided tours can be arranged for groups by contacting reserve management in advance. Public access is also available in groups of 5‚Äì20 with reserve guides for a fee - the typical hike is 1.5 to 2 hours. Public access for school group tours are free.

Fishtown was an informal artists' community housed in a cluster of old cabins and fishing shacks on the Skagit River delta in Skagit County, Washington, USA, from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. It was part of the larger Skagit Valley arts community, centered on the town of La Conner, but was rustic and isolated, without electricity or plumbing, and tended to attract younger and more eccentric artists. It was home to several noted painters, poets, and sculptors.

With changing lifestyles and increasing pressure from the land's owners, the Fishtown artists' community gradually dispersed, beginning in the late 1970s. In 1988, most of the original fishing shacks and the boardwalks that connected them were demolished, amid protests by remaining residents and their supporters.

Photo: David King (n.d.) Background A desire to live a more natural and simple lifestyle was an important aspect of the hippie counterculture of the 1960s; this impulse lead to the creation of hundreds of new co-operative communities in the United States. These communes had a variety of different intents and structures, ranging from carefully organized religious or agricultural communes to more relaxed artists' colonies, of which there was already a long history in the U.S.Issitt, Micah L.- Hippies: A Guide to an American Subculture, Greenwood, 2009. In the Pacific Northwest there were a number of established artists living or working regularly in Washington's Skagit Valley (about 60 mi. north of Seattle), an area where mist-filtered sunlight brought soft illumination to river-crossed farmland ringed by forested mountains, marshes, coastal tidelands, and the expanse of Puget Sound. This landscape had been an inspiration to artists of the internationally renowned 'Northwest School', particularly Guy Anderson and Morris Graves. Both had grown up nearby, and lived in or near Skagit Valley at various times. Anderson had permanently moved to the town of La Conner, on the Swinomish Channel, in 1959.HistoryLink.org Essay 5157; Ament, Deloris Tarzan-Anderson, Guy Anderson (1906-1998), Painter; http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file;_id=5157 retvd 2 12 16 Beginnings Charles Krafft (b. 1948) was a young writer and artist from Seattle inspired by the poets Li Po and Gary Snyder, and by the 'mystic' artists of the Northwest School, with whom he shared an interest in Buddhism and Asian art. After travels in India and Europe and time amid San Francisco's counterculture, Krafft returned to the Northwest. He had earlier befriended Morris Graves and Guy Anderson, and while visiting Anderson in La Conner became enamored of the Skagit Valley.McGee, Mike, & Reid, Larry - Villa Delirium: The Art of Charles Krafft, Last Gasp, 2002. In 1968 he joined sculptor Art Jorgenson as a settler of \\"Fishtown\\", the local name given to a group of fishing shacks connected by an elevated boardwalk, near where the North Fork of the Skagit River empties into Puget Sound.

Krafft and poet/scholar Paul Hansen decorated buildings with Buddhist script. Recalled Hans Nelsen: \\"There were poets and sculptors and some truly great painters working mostly in ink and water based medium. They were very influenced by Chinese and Japanese art, and were studying Chinese poetry, philosophy, Buddhism. People were meditating. The setting looked like a Chinese landscape and it inspired people.\\" 1970s heyday By the early 1970s Fishtown had a steady flow of visitors and several year-round residents, with Krafft serving as the commune's \\"self-proclaimed mayor\\", organizing basic logistics - although, as Bo Miller would later point out, \\"There was no control over anybody else's life out there. We weren't looking for a father figure. We weren't looking for someone to tell us what to do. We knew, each, bloody well what we wanted to do. We were strong personalities.\\" A large storage shed/boathouse with double doors was renamed \\"the Temple\\" and used for meetings, meditation classes, musical sessions, and beer parties. A group of abandoned cabins a short distance upriver gradually became part of the community,Brown, Bruce: \\"North Fork Skagit River Reverie\\"; http://www.astonisher.com/archives/skagit_fishtown.html; retvd 3 2 16 while further downriver poet Robert Sund built up his own shack, which became a meeting place for the group of poets known as The Great Blue Heron Society - at various times including Paul Hansen, Glenn Turner, Clifford Burke, Tim McNulty, Sam Hamill, Finn Wilcox, Steve Herold, and others. Though never more than a loose affiliation, they developed a distinctively spare, earthy style of Northwest poetry.Owens, Fred -Frog Hospital: A bit of Fishtown History, Jan.19, 2010; http://froghospital911.blogspot.com/2010/01/bit-of-fishtown- history.html retvd 2 14 16 In February 1971 a group show of works by Fishtown artists Alan Benditt, F.

Seattle Art Museum, 1974; ASIN B0006WUCMI The success of these shows brought considerable attention to the artists of the Skagit River and nearby La Conner, as did the surprise success in 1971 of the novel Another Roadside Attraction by local writer Tom Robbins. Wrote Charles Krafft in 1992: \\"My memories of the period are ones of an extended celebration set against a backdrop of rustic simplicity and awesome natural beauty. Weather permitting, artists picnicked together, explored the sloughs in leaky scows, danced all night and even roller skated en masse regularly. We recklessly traded beers and blatherskite, books, tools, sweethearts, and insults in the town taverns[.]\\" Later years In the late 1970s changing lifestyles led to many Fishtown residents moving on - some to new careers in other states, some, such as Bo Miller and Jo Jeffrey, simply moving into homes with electricity and running water nearby.'Forty Years in Fishtown' Documentary Preview: version March 7, 2015; dir. Pat Ford; https://vimeo.com/121562250 Art Jorgenson and a few others remained, and several new residents arrived. Charles Krafft was key in organizing Skagit Valley artists' participation in the Northwest/New York exhibitions at the Bayard Gallery in Soho in 1980 - 81, although he himself had moved back to Seattle in 1980. In the mid-1980s the owners of the property, the Chamberlain family, began clear-cutting the land around Fishtown with an eye toward development. Residents and supporters used protest and legal action to try and stave off the logging trucks, culminating in a clash in which renowned artist Richard Gilkey and several others were arrested by Skagit County sheriff's deputies. After this, in 1988, the area was extensively logged and most of the shacks, boardwalks, and cabins demolished.Owens, Fred -Frog Hospital: Everybody Liked the Fishtown Art Show Except Me;July 14, 2010; http://froghospital911.blogspot.com/2010/07/everybody-liked-fishtown-art- show.html retvd 2 15 16 Legacy The cabin built by Marty Chamberlain and John Bisbee still stands.

It is one of the eleven hundreds of the County of Adelaide stretching from the Torrens in the south to the Little Para River in the north; and spanning from the coast in the west to the Adelaide foothills in the east. It is roughly bisected from east to west by Dry Creek. It was named in 1846 by Governor Frederick Robe, Yatala being likely derived from 'yartala', an indigenous word referring to the flooded state of the plain either side of Dry Creek after heavy rain.  Etymology  Contemporary Australian linguists believe the name \\"Yatala\\" is derived from \\"yartala\\", a Kaurna word which likely means \\"water running by the side of a river\\" or \\"inundation\\" or \\"cascade\\" or similar. South Australian historian Geoff Manning has implied that this refers to the swampy morass that occurred when heavy rain inundated the usually-dry plain either side of Dry Creek. The descriptive term \\"yartala\\" is thought to have been \\"co- opted by the colonists [as \\"Yatala\\"] in their endeavours to name [various] things including a government schooner,\\" the Yatala, in 1865. According to Rob Amery (2009), \\"Yatala\\" had been used as a place name by white settlers of the Adelaide Plains since 1836, referring initially to the River Torrens (called Yertala by the Kaurna people while in flood) and later to the land north of the Torrens, stretching from the coast at Port Adelaide to the foothills at Tea Tree Gully. Yatala was thus a natural choice for the land administration division in 1846. Plan of the Hundred of Yatala, 1957 Local government The Adelaide City council was established in 1842, bringing local government to North Adelaide and the north parklands on the south edge of the hundred. The District Council of Hindmarsh was established in June 1853 and encompassed all the land south west of modern Torrens Road and south of the future portside councils of Queenstown and Alberton and Glanville. The District Council of Yatala was established days later and occupied a large central portion of the hundred as well as eastern parts of the Hundred of Port Adelaide. It approximately extended from modern Torrens Road and the North Arm of Barker Inlet in the west to the west border of the modern Tea Tree Gully council in the east. Shortly thereafter, in July of the same year, the District Council of Highercombe was established in the east of the hundred, bringing the whole hundred under local governance. As various parts of the original District Council of Yatala were separated ‚Äî parts north of Dry Creek for Salisbury council and parts in the south for Walkerville and Prospect councils ‚Äî the original name of 'Yatala' was obscured and finally lost (to local government) when the last remaining namesake, Yatala South council was renamed in 1935 to Enfield. The following local government areas of South Australia are situated inside (or largely inside) the bounds of the hundred : * City of Salisbury (except portion north of the Little Para River) * City of Tea Tree Gully * City of Port Adelaide Enfield (portion south of Grand Junction Road and east of Port Wakefield Road, approximating the former City of Enfield) * City of Charles Sturt (except portion south of Henley Beach Road) * City of Prospect * City of Adelaide (portion north of the River Torrens) * Town of Walkerville Parts of the Adelaide Hills Council area (Paracombe, Houghton, Upper Hermitage and Lower Hermitage, west of Millbrook and Inglewood) and the City of Playford (Sampson Flat west of Shillabeer Road) also overlap the far eastern portion of the hundred.

Rear Admiral Robert Francis Anthony Studds (17 December 1896 ‚Äì 28 May 1962) was a career officer in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, predecessor of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps. He served as the fourth Director of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Early life Studds was born in Washington, D.C., on a farm near the Soldier's Home on 17 December 1896. After primary and secondary education at parochial and public schools in Washington, he attended the Catholic University of America, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering in 1917. He accepted a position with the Sanitary Division of the District of Columbia government. However, the United States had entered World War I on the side of the Allies in April 1917, and Studds soon joined the United States Army. Assigned to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, he served in the 472nd Engineer Regiment at Camp A. A. Humphreys in Virginia through the end of the war in November 1918 and until May 1919, when he returned to civilian life and to his job with the District of Columbia government.Arlington National Cemetery Website: Robert Francis Anthony Studds, Rear Admiral, U. S. Coast & Geodetic Survey Career =Early career= Later in 1919, Studds began his career with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, accepting a commission as an officer in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps. His first assignment was as a deck officer and junior engineering officer aboard the Coast and Geodetic Survey survey ship USC&GS; Natoma. From 1922 to 1923 he served aboard the coastal survey ship USC&GS; Lydonia (CS 302), conducting hydrographic survey work along the coasts of Oregon and Florida. He served in the Philippine Islands from 1923 to 1926 aboard the survey ship USC&GS; Pathfinder. Returning to the United States, Studds was officer-in-charge of the survey launch USC&GS; Elsie III from 1926 to 1929; during his tour aboard her, Elsie III conducted hydrographic surveys in New York Harbor and along the coast of South Carolina. He served a brief tour aboard the survey ship USC&GS; Ranger along the coast of Puerto Rico in 1927. =15 August 1936 typhoon= By 1936, Studds was back in the Philippines as commanding officer of the survey ship USC&GS; Fathomer. With only a few days left to conclude the 1936 season's work on northeast Luzon, Studds was forced on 9 August 1936 to suspend hydrographic survey operations and order Fathomer to seek shelter in Port San Vicente as a typhoon approached the area; it passed about from Fathomer ºs position on 11 August. On 12 August Fathomer attempted to return to the survey working grounds, but confused seas and a heavy swell compelled him to order her to return to Port San Vicente. He planned for her to depart again on 13 August, but was forced to cancel these plans when another typhoon approached. By 14 August it was apparent from the typhoon's track that it would strike Port San Vicente. That afternoon, Studds ordered Fathomer ºs crew to prepare to ride out the storm, securing her gear and anchoring her in the inner harbor.Studds, R. F. A., \\"The Stranding and Salvaging of the 'Fathomer' in the Typhoon of 8/15/1936, Port San Vicente, P.I.,\\" U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Field Engineers Bulletin No. 10, December 1936, pp. 124-131. Rain squalls associated with the typhoon arrived at Port San Vicente at about 0600 hours on 15 August 1936, and Fathomer began sending frequent weather reports to Manila. The weather deteriorated throughout the day, and winds reached by 1730 hours; by 1905 hours winds were estimated to have reached 120 to 150 miles (193 to 242 kilometers) per hour and were creating waves high even in the virtually landlocked inner harbor, so Studds ordered Fathomer to begin to operate her engines first at half-speed ahead and then at full speed ahead to try to keep from drifting. However, one of her anchor cables parted, and the wind and seas forced her aground on a reef at about 1925 hours, after which the wind forced her to list heavily to starboard. Fathomer aground in the inner harbor at Port San Vicente, Luzon, in the Philippine Islands, after the typhoon of 15 August 1936. The size of the waves in the inner harbor can be estimated by the height of Fathomer's port side above the water; at the height of the typhoon, waves broke over her crewmen as they sheltered there.The typhoon's eye passed over Fathomer from 2015 to 2035 hours, allowing her crew to make some repairs and send a distress signal to Manila, but the extremely high winds had returned by 2040 hours. The wind forced the ship's bow around to the southwest. She listed to starboard so far that her boat deck rail was underwater. The galley range and rice boiler broke loose and tore off a ventilator to the forecastle, causing the forecastle to flood, and the engine room and boiler room also became flooded when the engine room house's starboard side became submerged. The ship's generator failed at 2100 hours, leaving her in darkness, and the radio house had to be abandoned when it threatened to tear loose from the ship. The crew took shelter along the port alleyway, well above the water's surface, but waves increased in height significantly and broke over the men despite their height above the water. The wind and waves began to moderate at about 2200 hours, and by 2230 Fathomer's crew ‚Äì all of whom survived the ordeal ‚Äì could begin to work on deck again. After daybreak on 16 August 1936, repairs began in earnest, and Studds ordered some crew members to go ashore to establish a camp and render assistance to local Filipinos. At 1300 hours, the radio was repaired and Fathomer sent an SOS; the British steamer SS City of Florence immediately answered and relayed messages between Fathomer and Manila until City of Florence had moved out of range. In response to the messages, the United States Lighthouse Service lighthouse tender USLHT Canlaon departed Manila on 18 August to assist Fathomer, stopping at Aparri on 20 August to take the derrick dredge Aparri under tow. Canlaon and Aparri reached Port San Vicente at 1400 hours on 20 August, and salvage operations began immediately. Fathomer was made watertight, the reef was dynamited, and Aparri dredged loose material to free Fathomer. At 0215 hours on 29 August, Fathomer was off the reef and afloat. Fathomer's crewmen ashore struck camp at daybreak on 29 August; Canlaon left Port San Vicente at 1250 hours on 30 August with Fathomer in tow, and the ships arrived at Manila at 1500 hours on 1 September 1936. Examination of data later suggested that Fathomers barometric pressure reading at the height of the typhoon, of mercury, was probably the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Philippine Islands up to that time. Studds wrote a vivid account of Fathomer's experience in the typhoon that appeared as an article in the December 1936 edition of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Field Engineers Bulletin. He gave credit to the officers and men of Fathomer for the ship's survival and the successful salvaging of the ship, but Coast and Geodetic Survey officials credited his oversight of the crew in maintaining the ship and her equipment for her survival of the powerful typhoon. =Later career= USC&GS; Pathfinder (OSS 30) in the Aleutian Islands in the years following World War II. Returning to the United States, Studds had various duties in the Washington, D.C., office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and in 1938 he became assistant chief of the Charts Division. By late 1943 he was still in this position and had reached the rank of commander. After the conclusion of World War II in 1945, Studds took command of the ocean survey ship USC&GS; Pathfinder (OSS 30), namesake of the earlier USC&GS; Pathfinder he had served aboard in the 1920s. Conducting hydrographic surveys under his command in the waters off the Aleutian Islands, the newer Pathfinder discovered many seamounts. =Director= Reaching the rank of rear admiral, Studds became the Director, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, in May 1950. He served in this capacity, guiding the Survey through both civilian research and research related to supporting the U.S. armed forces in the Cold War, until he retired in August 1955.

He is known for composing several Cornish Christmas Carols and the 1897 publication of his book The Christmas Welcome, was released in Germany through C.G. Roder, Leipzig. Thomas learned to play music on a harmonium, which he kept into his adult life as one of his most treasured possessions. John Henry Thomas' father, John Thomas, was a miner in Cornwall and arrived in South Australia in 1885 with his wife, Catherine Jacka after the mining boom had occurred due to the discovery of copper in 1861 in Moonta. The mine became prosperous and many Cornish miners followed after an advertisement by the South Australian Government. In 1875 Moonta was the second largest town after the capital, Adelaide, with a population of 12,000 people. Thus the miners made an important contribution to the Australian economy and were crucial to the prospering of Moonta and the surrounding district. They brought their culture and traditions with them including their music which was pivotal in keeping their Cornish culture alive. This area became a virtual Cornish enclave and was named \\"Little Cornwall\\". John Henry Thomas helped to maintain the Cornish culture through his compositions and leadership in the musical community. Thomas moved to Australia with his parents as an infant and as an adult was active in Moonta, where he worked as a composer and conductor. In November 1878 J.H. Thomas married Elizabeth Ann Thomas, with whom he had four children. He was also active in the general community and served as a councilor from 1901 to 1903 and later as an auditor for many firms in the following years.

Gurra Milto Sotir Gurra (1884‚Äì1972) was an Albanian journalist and short story writer of the 20th-century. He first works came out during the last period of the Albanian National Awakening and continued for a 50-year period. Although simple in character and at times permeated by naive sentimental notes, Gurra's work reserves a certain importance within the Albanian literature due to its social context and thematics. Beside his own creations, Gurra translated to Albanian some of the masterpieces of the classic Russian literature. Life and work Gurra was born on 16 May 1884 in Marjan village of the Opar region near Kor√ß√´, back then part of the Ottoman Empire, today's southeastern Albania. As many southern Albanians, he had to emigrate at a young age. Gurra settled initially in Odessa, and later in Istanbul, Sofia, Constan»õa, and the United States. He collaborated with the local established Albanian communities and their press organs using the pen- names \\"Nomadhi\\", \\"Gjon Zeza\\", and \\"D.To√ßka\\". His initial literature work consisted of short stories. They were periodically published in the Shqiperia (Albania) journal of Kristo Luarasi in Sofia, Bulgaria, and were later compiled in two story collections in 1911: Goca e Mal√´sis√´ (The Highland Girl) and Rr√´fenja (Narrations). His best stories are considered to be the ones written while residing in Odessa. Gurra published or co-published also his own journals, such as Atdheu (The homeland) published in Constan»õa, Romania in 1912, the monthly Shk√´ndija (The sparkle) of 1921 in Kor√ß√´, Zekthi (The gadfly), a satiric paper, and Z√´ri i Popullit (The voice of the people), a bi- monthly social-political journal, started in 1922 in Kor√ß√´, Mituria (The childhood), and Vatra a Rinis√´ (Hearth of Youth) where he published pieces written for children. As a journalist, he published articles in the Albanian communities' newspapers, such as Dielli (The sun), Kombi (The nation), Bashkimi i Kombit (Nation's Unity), Shqypeja e Shqypenis, etc. He translated Russian literature works from Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov, and Gorky. Gurra died in Tirana in 1972. Writing style Gurra's writing activity spans in around 50 years. His initial work expressed a mixture of Nationalist and Romantic ideas conform the general line of the National Awakening, like many other Albanian writers and poets of the same era. Later works would be characterized by sentimentalism. As an emigrant, he was close to the problems and difficulties that the Albanian diaspora continuously dealt with. He described emigration as a tragedy which had made miserable the lives of many. The short story \\"The mother\\" describes how emigration destroyed families and filled people's lives with anxiety. Loneliness and the unhappy lives of the emigrants families is the theme of the short stories \\"The death of Mara\\" and \\"The belated cheque\\". In a number of stories, such as \\"Life after death\\", Gurra described the life of big cities, and how the lights and pleasures ruined many young emigrants. A collection of 22 of these stories were published in Tirana in 1938 under the name Plag√´t e Kurbetit (Torments of exile), where he also shows influence from O.Henry and Maupassant. Beside prose, Gurra left also a poetic collection named D√´shir√´ (Desire). The Albanian composer Kristo Kono used some of Gurra's poetry and composed songs, such as Fol e qesh moj sylarushe (Talk and laugh o you bright eyed girl\\"), which entered the classic reportorial of the urban lyric music in Albania.

It is one of the eleven hundreds of the County of Adelaide. It was named in 1846 by Governor Frederick Robe, Munno Para being a term from a local Kaurna Aboriginal people meaning golden wattle creek. This name refers to either the Gawler River (which starts at the confluence of the South Para River and North Para River) or the Little Para River. Cadastral map from 1964 History The District Council of Munno Para East and District Council of Munno Para West were established in 1853 and 1854, respectively, bringing local government to the whole hundred. In 1899 a part of the council of Munno Para West was severed to be the District Council of Gawler South and later merged with the Corporate Town of Gawler in 1933. The remainder of the council of Munno Para West was abolished in the same year, with part going to the Gawler municipality, part to the new District Council of Salisbury and the remainder merging with Munno Para East council to form the new District Council of Munno Para, extending across the entire hundred from west to east with the exception of Salisbury encroaching in the southwest corner and Gawler occupying the north eastern corner. The Munno Para council was based at Smithfield in the centre of the hundred and directly beside the main road north. In the post-war boom the township of Elizabeth was established within the hundred between the existing Smithfield and Salisbury townships to house workers for the new Holden automotive manufacturing plant. Initially part of Salisbury council area, it became a municipal council in its own right called the Town of Elizabeth in 1964, by severance from Salisbury. Salisbury attained city status just months later in the same year. Munno Para council was accorded city status in 1988 and the two cities of Munno Para and Elizabeth ultimately merged to form the City of Playford northerly adjacent to Salisbury in 1997. The local government areas whose boundaries cross into the hundred, , are thus the City of Playford across most of the hundred, the City of Salisbury occupying the south west corner including the RAAF Edinburgh and accompanying Department of Defence precinct, and the Town of Gawler occupying the north east corner surrounding the Gawler township at the confluence of North Para and South Para rivers.

It was from St Alban's Church that St Anne's Church was founded. In 1773, a pair of cottages on Chapel Street were turned into a chapel. In 1781, a purpose-built chapel was constructed next to the converted cottages. It was paid for by a Mrs Mary Hodgson and cost ¬£400. In 1819, Fr James Sharples became priest of the Blackburn mission. In 1823, he bought a site for a larger church in the Larkhill part of Blackburn. From 1824 to 1826, a church was built on that site. It was a Georgian building with a Romanesque Revival tower. In the 1880s and 1890s, plans were made to build a larger church on the site by the priests of the church, Dean John Newton (died 1896) and Canon Peter Lonsdale. The architect was Edward Goldie. On 13 October 1898, the foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Salford, Herbert Vaughan. On 8 December 1901, the church was opened.

The next priest for the church, Fr Thomas Henshaw, became the Bishop of Salford after a few months. His successor, Fr Thomas Singleton, oversaw the remaining construction. At midnight of 24 December 1926, the church was opened. Over the course of the next two years, the interior was added to with the installation of side altars dedicated to the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Virgin Mary, altar rails, a sanctuary lamp, marble pulpit, organ and baptismal font. In 1932, the high altar was installed. In 1947, the church that was built in 1852 was turned into a parish hall. In 1966, the presbytery was replaced by the present one. It was designed by the firm, Desmond Williams & Associates from Manchester. =Rebuilding= In 2000, with the depopulation of the town, plans were drawn up for the church to be reduced in size. In December 2000, the church was damaged by an arson attack.

Almir Chediak was born into a Lebanese immigrant family and grew up on the state of Minas Gerais. He showed an early aptitude for music, starting guitar lessons at 7. As he moved to live in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 13, he started studying guitar under the instructions of reputed guitarist of that time Dino 7 Cordas. Precociously at age of 17, Chediak already began working professionally as a guitar instructor and also scoring soundtracks for films directed by Jece Valad√£o and others, also writing string and horn arrangements for recording sessions. Still young, he recorded a single with the actress and Belgian model living in Brazil Annik Malvil, introducer of the little tube dress fashion in the 1960s. His students included the likes of Gal Costa, Nara Le√£o, Cazuza, Tim Maia, Carlos Lyra, and Elba Ramalho, among numerous others. In 1984, Almir Chediak launched his first book \\"The Dictionary of Notated Chords\\" and in 1986 he founded his own publishing house, the \\"Lumiar Record\\". At the same year, he launched his second book \\"Methods of Harmony and Improvisation\\". Both of his works are widely used in Brazil and have been influential in training the generation of young Brazilian musicians now entering their prime. In 1988 Almir Chediak introduced the Songbook series of Brazilian Popular Music elaborating the precise transcription of the complete lyrics, melodies and harmonies of leading composers for publication in songbooks establishing a written library to guarantee Brazilian music would survive for future generations to study and enjoy. The idea was born when Chediak was giving guitar lessons to the son of Caetano Veloso in the mid-1980s and found that Veloso was often at a loss to remember what chords he had played or the words he had sung on a particular song. It included the definitive versions of nearly 200 of Veloso's songs. In 1991, Almir Chediak launched his publishing house of CDs \\"Lumiar Discos\\" and the Songbooks were now accompanied by CD's that had new and innovative versions of the songs performed by other leading names of Brazilian popular music. He produced those albums, and was widely praised for rescuing obscure songs and for persuading artists to record songs that were thought to be at odds with their usual styles or public images. Now everyone in Brazil and outside the country would be able to sing and play the songs, with their proper harmonies whenever they want, and that was never before done until Chediak starts his enterprises. In all, Chediak edited 18 songbooks, featuring artists like Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque, Djavan, Noel Rosa and Ary Barroso. While nearing completion on a songbook retrospective of Jo√£o Bosco and writing a biography of singer Tim Maia, Chediak was attacked by robbers and was shot to death. He was 52 years old.

It is a small shrub with narrow leaves and lilac-coloured flowers on an S-shaped stalk. Description Eremophila metallicorum is a shrub with many tangled branches which usually grows to a height of less than . The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are thick, linear to almost cylindrical in shape, mostly long, wide, have small raised glands and are sticky and shiny due to the presence of resin. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a sticky, S-shaped stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, hairy, green to reddish-brown or purple sepals which are egg- shaped and mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is pale to deep lilac-coloured on the outside and white with lilac or dark reddish-purple spots on the inside. The outer surface of the tube and petal lobes is hairy, the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs mainly from April to October and the fruits which follow are oval-shaped, greyish-white, hairy and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Spencer Le Marchant Moore in 1899 and the description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (metallicorum) is a Latin word meaning \\"of the miners\\" referring to the mining area north of Leonora where the type specimen was collected. Distribution and habitat Miners poverty bush is common in areas near Kalgoorlie, Leinster, Paynes Find and Laverton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Gibson Desert, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It grows in red-brown clay loam in mulga woodland, often along drainage lines and flat areas. Conservation status Eremophila metallicorum is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife Use in horticulture The sparse, narrow leaves of this hardy shrub allow its blue flowers to be attractively displayed. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grown in most soil types, including clay. It prefers a sunny, open position, is very drought tolerant and tolerant of light frosts. It needs to be lightly pruned each year to keep the plant compact.

Eubel, Hierarchia catholica I editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 316. Thus, B√©rard became Primate of All Gaul, Duke of Lyon, and Peer of France. Cathedral of S. Jean de Lyon (at left) Lyon was a serious problem for Archbishop B√©rard. The diocese was saddled with considerable debt, due to the imprudent fiscal habits of several of his predecessors. Pope Nicholas was aware of the problem when he appointed B√©rard, and he granted B√©rard special license to appropriate the income of the first year of each of the benefices of his diocese for a period of five years in order to apply the money received to settle the debts. The Pope also wanted Archbishop B√©rard to attack the abuse of a single person holding several benefices, out of greed and without papal dispensation. The Pope also demanded that those persons who held benefices should take up residence and be properly ordained. He granted the Archbishop the privilege of removing any person who had received benefices since the Council of Lyon (1274) who had not proceeded to the priesthood within a year of the Archbishop's arrival. Pope Nicholas also granted Archbishop B√©rard the right to make his own Testament.Registres de Nicolas IV, Tome I, pp. 413-414, no. 2369, 2370, 2374, 2382 (10 March 1290), no. 2329 (24 March 1290). Later in the same year, when the Pope was sending as Legates to France Cardinals Gerard Bianchi and Benedetto Caetani, he instructed them to settle the longstanding differences that existed at Lyon between the Archbishop and the Cathedral Chapter.Registres de Nicolas IV, Tome I, p. 438, no. 2603. But, having heard that royal officials were molesting ecclesiastical persons in the diocese of Lyon, and that some members of the Cathedral Chapter were threatening canonical censures against the Archbishop, the Pope granted the Archbishop immunity from such interferences.Registres de Nicolas IV, Tome I, p. 442-443, no. 2649 (15 May 1260). Two years later, the debts of the diocese of Lyon were such that Pope Nicholas allowed him to keep 3,000 livres tournois out of the annual collection of some 7,000 livres tournois which were earmarked to be sent to Rome, provided that the money be used to extinguish the debts.Registres de Nicolas IV, Tome III (1892), p. 926, no. 6927 (20 March 1292). Politically, the situation in Lyon was improving. In March, 1292, the Archbishop finally came to an agreement with the Chapter and Provost over the exercise of judicial powers in the city of Lyon.Registres de Nicolas IV, Tome III (1892), pp. 928-935, no. 6949-6950. Menestrier, pp. 333-337, gives a detailed narrative of the issues and events in the dispute. Cardinal B√©rard Archbishop B√©rard de Got was created cardinal by Pope Celestine V in the Consistory of 18 September 1294, and named to the post of Bishop of Albano.Eubel, p. 11, 35. Cardinal B√©rard de Got participated in the Conclave of December 23‚Äì24, 1294, which elected Cardinal Benedetto Caetani.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Conclave of December, 1294. . retrieved 02/15/2016. He took the name Boniface VIII. Peace Mission to France and England Philip IV and Edward I (1286) On 18 February 1295, Pope Celestine's successor, Boniface VIII (Benedetto Caetani), appointed Cardinal B√©rard de Got and Cardinal Simon de Beaulieu as Nuncios to King Edward I of England and King Philip IV of France to do everything possible to arrange a peace in the conflict that had broken out in the previous year. Next day the Pope sent a letter to King Edward, advising him of the appointment, and apologizing that he had not done it sooner, due to the dangerous roads between Naples, where he had been elected, and Rome, where he was crowned on January 23, 1295.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), nos. 24026-24027. King Edward lost no time in securing a friendly hearing at the Papal Court; on 6 April 1295, he wrote a letter to Cardinal Matthew of Aquasparta, replying to a letter to him from the Cardinal about a peace between England and France. The King's letter requested the Cardinal to use his influence on the King's behalf, since the King had always had peace, concord, and good will in his intentions. The Cardinal was advised to seek detailed information about the King's affairs from his Cleric, Bertrandus de Got, Papal Chaplain.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, Conventiones, Literae et cujuscunque generis Acta Publica Tomus II (London: A. and J. Churchill, 1705) , p. 672. Similar letters were written to each of the other cardinals. The two ambassadors, B√©rard de Got and Simon de Beaulieu, arrived in London around the time of Pentecost,In a letter of 28 April 1295, to Cardinal B√©rard de Got, King Edward expresses his happiness that the Cardinal has arrived in his domains. Rymer, p. 679. where they awaited the King's return from Wales, which came around August 1. The Cardinals presented the King with a request for a truce of two years. The King replied that treaty obligations to the King of the Romans forbade him to make a truce or peace without his consent. The Cardinals asked the King to obtain it, and he agreed to do so. On 14 August, the King wrote directly to Pope Boniface, rehearsing the same difficulties as well as his immense willingness. On the same day he signed a document authorizing the two Cardinals to treat for a truce with King Philip.Rymer, p. 685-686. The Cardinals returned to France around September 8, 1295.'Thomas of Walsingham', Historia Anglicana, p. 51. On 22 June 1295, Pope Boniface mentioned in a letter to his ambassadors to King Adolf that he had ratified a truce (treuga, not a peace) among Edward I, Philip IV, and Adolf, King of the Romans.Potthast, no. 24107. On 13 April 1296, the Pope approved another truce among the three Kings, to begin on 24 June 1296.Potthast, no. 24315. On 21 April 1296, Boniface ordered the two cardinals to publish in France and England his Constitution on Ecclesiastical Liberties, Clericis laicos, which he had signed in February.Potthast, no.24321 and 24386. In the Spring of 1296, while King Edward was still at Berwick, Cardinal B√©rard returned to England to receive the King's reply as to a truce; the King, without getting the consent of the King of the Romans, could only refuse the Cardinal, who immediately returned to France.'Thomas of Walsingham', Historia Anglicana, p. 62. Rymer, p. 708 (24 April 1296) and pp. 709-711. On 18 August 1296, the Pope, who had received a suggestion from King Philip IV that negotiations for peace with King Edward might better be conducted at the Papal Court, eagerly accepted the suggestion that the King send his brother the Comte d'Alen√ßon to him so that they could deal conveniently with confidential matters.Potthast, no. 24384. On the same day Boniface warned King Adolf not to be so hostile to Philip IV or his kingdom, and that he should direct his efforts toward peace.Potthast, no. 24385. But on 17 September 1296, Pope Boniface seems to have given up on long-distance diplomacy; he advised King Philip and King Edward to send ambassadors (nuntii) to the Papal Court, since his ambassadors had been able to achieve nothing.Potthast, no. 24394. In February, 1297, the two cardinals, B√©rard and Simon, were still in France, where they were advised that, if King Philip or his officials should obstruct the transfer of funds for the Holy Land, they were to be publicly denounced and notified that they had fallen under the appropriate ecclesiastical censures.Potthast, no. 24469. King Philip had prohibited the transfer of money outside the kingdom without royal licence. And on 12 February 1297, King Edward was still sending representatives to discuss a truce or peace with the Cardinals. At the same time, the King was sending out summonses to his vassals, lay and ecclesiastic, to join in a war against the King of France.Rymer, p. 757, 766-768. Death B√©rard de Got died on 27 June 1297, at a place unknown.F. Ughelli and N. Colet, Italia sacra Vol. 1, second edition (Venice 1717), p. 268, state that B√©rard died in France. But they cite no source. They are followed by Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie delle cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa Tome II (Roma 1793), p. 41, also without mentioning a source. His friend and fellow Nuncio, Simon de Beaulieu was back at the Roman Curia, and died at Orvieto on 18 August 1297, less than eight weeks after B√©rard.Eubel, p. 11.

The asteroid was discovered by German amateur astronomer Wolf Bickel at his private Bergisch Gladbach Observatory on 22 September 1998. It was named after the discoverer's wife, Ingeborg Bickel‚ÄìKeller.  Orbit and classification  Ikeller is a member of the Koronis family, a group of stony asteroids in the outer main-belt named after 158 Koronis. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7‚Äì2.9 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,743 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins 10 years prior to its official discovery observation, with its identification as at ESO's La Silla Observatory in September 1988.  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Ikeller measures 5.4 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.22, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for Koronian asteroids of 0.24 and thus calculates a smaller diameter of 5.2 kilometers, as the higher the albedo (reflectivity), the smaller a body's diameter at a certain absolute magnitude (brightness). = Lightcurve = In August 2012, a photometric lightcurve of Ikeller was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.44 magnitude ().

While the competition is focused on graduate and undergraduate students from four year institutions, invitations are also extended to teams from community colleges. The latest (tenth annual) competition, in May 2019, cancelled all on-site activities and teams competed virtually with their written reports and presentations. University of Alabama's team, Alabama Astrobotics, won for the fifth consecutive year by winning the Grand Prize of The Joe Kosmo Award for Excellence. RMC 2019 Changes RMC 2019 was scheduled to take place between May 6th and 10th, 2019 at the Astronaut Memorial Foundation‚Äôs Center for Space Education Building in Kennedy Space Center. This year, the competition planned to move the competition arena indoors to avoid delays due to frequent thunderstorms as well as transitioning the mission objective from mining on Mars to mining on the moon. However, due to events such as the 2018‚Äì19 United States federal government shutdown and subsequent budget delays, the 2019 competition cancelled all on-site competition and activities. The teams are instead only scored on four categories: Plans for Systems Engineering, Systems Engineering Paper, Outreach Project Report, and a Virtual Slide Presentation and Demonstration. The plan and the presentation are optional for participating teams but all four must be submitted to qualify for the Grand Prize. In place of the usual on-site mining at NASA, University of Alabama hosted a Robotic Mining Challenge at the Tuscaloosa campus during the same time period as the originally planned NASA RMC. RMC Award categories The NASA Robotics Mining Competition website provides the following descriptions of the award categories: * Efficient Use of Communications Power Award: Awarded to the team for using the lowest average data utilization bandwidth per regolith points earned in both the timed and NASA monitored portion of the competition. Teams MUST collect the minimum amount of regolith to qualify for this award. * Regolith Mechanics Award: Awarded to the team with the best example of a real granular innovation that identified a specific regolith mechanics problem (like the way the soil flows around the grousers, or angle of repose too high in their dump bucket, etc.) and intentionally improved their design to deal with it.

(National Reference Laboratory for Plague, Tularemia, and Q Fever)  The history of the foundation of Pasteur Institute of Iran  One year after World War I and despite the persistent problems caused by casualties and infectious diseases in the country resulting from war, the Iranian government decided to renew its relationship with France to promote medical sciences and research concerning different types of endemic infectious diseases. The Iranian delegates met Pierre Paul √âmile Roux, the general director of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, in 1919 and this visit laid the foundation of Pasteur Institute of Iran. On 20 January 1921, Professor Ren√© Legroux, the leading delegate of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, signed a memorandum of understanding with the minister for foreign affairs of Iran and as a result, Pasteur Institute of Iran was established. Pasteur Institute of Iran was the tenth Pasteur Institute formed worldwide. Figure 1: Dr. Ren√© Legroux, Dr. Aliasghar Moadab Nafisi (the Iranian Minister of Health), signing the Memorandum of Understanding to establish Pasteur Institute of Iran, 1921. Moreover, Pasteur Institute of Iran formally started its activity on 23 August 1921. Following Emil Roux's suggestion, Joseph Mesnard was nominated as the first general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran and he served in this position for five years. The second French general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran was Joseph Kerandel, who arrived in Tehran in 1926 and stayed in Iran until the end of his life in 1934. He is buried in the Catholic graveyard in Tehran. This dedicated person devoted his life to the development of Pasteur Institute of Iran, complementing the contribution of his Iranian colleagues Dr Abolghasem Bahrami, Dr. Mehdi Ghodsi, Dr. Hassan Mirdamadi, Dr. Hussein Mashuf, Dr. Ahmad Najm Abadi, Dr. Vartani, Dr. Teymour Dolatshahi, among others; all of these activities led to the advancement of Pasteur Institute of Iran. After Dr. Kerandel's death, Dr. Hussein Mashuf was nominated general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran. After a year, Professor Legroux was appointed scientific director of Pasteur Institute of Iran on behalf of the Pasteur Institute of Paris. He made several trips to Iran to determine the strategies and supervise the activities of Pasteur Institute of Iran; in his absence, Dr. Abolghasem Bahrami was in charge. Due to World War II, the relationship between the Pasteur Institutes in Iran and Paris was interrupted (from 1939 to 1945); however, the institute continued its activities under the direct supervision of Dr. Bahrami and his deputy, Dr. Ghodsi. Before the war, when the number of laboratories was limited and their activities failed to meet the needs of the country, most of the national health issues related to the ministry of health were addressed by Pasteur Institute of Iran; one of its activities was evaluating the quarantining effectiveness in the country and Pasteur Institute of Iran successfully undertook this important responsibility with the contribution of the authorities at the time (Dr. Ehyaolmolk, Dr. Ehyaolsaltane, Dr. Amiraalam, and Dr. Loghmanolmolk). After World War II, in order to further develop Pasteur Institute of Iran and establish new departments, Dr. Manuchehr Eghbal, the Minister of Health, invited a group of members of the Pasteur Institute of Paris to come to Iran to revise the structures and suggest new strategies. This team, including Dr. Pasteur Valery Radot, the head of the council of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, and other officials visited Iran in 1946; they also participated in the 25th anniversary of the inauguration of Pasteur Institute of Iran. On the 25 August 1946, the complementary agreement of technical and scientific memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Pasteur Institutes of Iran and Paris was signed. According to this memorandum, Pasteur Institute of Iran was to be formally and financially independent and under the supervision of the minister of health; one of the French experts, Dr. Marcel Baltazard, working in the Pasteur Institute of Morocco, was nominated to be the general director of Pasteur Institute of Iran. According to the new schedule, Pasteur Institute of Iran started a new approach and focusing its activities in the fields of medicine, epidemiology and research; to this end, one important issue was plague studies.  The history of plague in Iran  Iranian physicians were familiar with the human plague for a long time. Although there is little information about the situation of plague from earlier centuries, we have more documented evidence from the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Qajar dynasty (1895 to 1925), cholera and plague were the most frequently documented outbreaks. Such lethal diseases were not hard to imagine considering the poor hygiene and lack of knowledge about the root of transmission, prevention and effective treatment of that time. Several plague outbreaks took place during the Qajar dynasty in Iran. In 1871, a severe form of plague outbreak happened in Saghez and Bane (two cities in Kurdistan province) and the Iranian and non-Iranian physicians, such as Dr. Johan Louis Schlimmer, the instructor in the Darolfonun School, were appointed to control this disease. Dr. Schlimmer noted his observations in his book, \\"Schlimmer's Terminology\\", published in 1874.Schlimmer, J.L., Terminologie medico-pharmaceutique et anthropologique Francaise-Persane: avec traductions Anglaise et Allemande des termes Fran√ßais, indications des lieux de provenance des principaux produits animaux et v√©g√©taux. 1874: Lithographie d'Ali Gouli Khan. The first Iranian physician who registered his observations about plague using modern medical science was Mohammad Razi Tabatabai, the senior physician in Naser al-Din Shah's army; his book was published under the title \\"Plague\\" in 1875. Dr. Joseph Desire Tholozan, (1820 to 1897), the royal physician of Naser Al-din Shah and the head of the ministry of health at that time, evaluated the main and natural foci of plague in Kurdistan between 1870 and 1882 and found certain foci for the disease in various villages of that area.Theodorides, J., Un grand √©pid√©miologiste franco-mauricien: Joseph D√©sir√© Tholoza (1820-1897).

Akanlu and plague  In 1946, together with the new program of activities of Pasteur Institute of Iran, the epidemiology department of Pasteur Institute of Iran started its activities under the supervision of Dr. Baltazard, the general director of the institute. They started their mission in Northwest of Iran and attempted to prepare an epidemiological map of infectious diseases of the country using a portable laboratory in a truck.Baltazard, M., L'Institut Pasteur de l'Iran vu par. 2004, Theran: Fascicule √©dit√© par le service de coop√©ration et d'action culturelle de l'ambassade de France en R I d'Iran √† l'occasion de l'inauguration du pavillon Baltazard de l'Institut Pasteur d'Iran. It later became more practical after they were equipped with professional cars. Although Kurdistan had a history of plague, it was due to the plague outbreak in Kurdistan in the same year that for the first time the research teams were dispatched to an area in which they could control the outbreak via quarantining the foci and epidemiological procedures on the humans and rodents. Studies of the plague foci in this region and the importance of this disease motivated Dr. Baltazard, Dr. Shamsa, Dr. Karimi, Dr. Habibi, Dr. Bahmanyar, Dr. Agha Eftekhari, Dr. Farhang Azad, Dr. Seyyedian and Dr. Majd Teymouri to conduct extensive scientific and epidemiologic studies after educating expert technicians and providing sufficient facilities.Rezvan H, et al., A preliminary study on the prevalence of anti-HCV amongst healthy blood donors in Iran. Vox Sang, 1994. 67 ((suppl): 100.). 6. Mollaret, H., et al., La peste de fouissement. Bull Soc Pathol Exot, 1963. 56: pp. 1186-1193. During the nine plague outbreaks in Kurdistan and Azerbaijan between 1946 and 1965, many infected people survived from the disease by the efforts of the dispatched teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran; however, 156 died. In 1952, the first plague laboratory was founded in Akanlu village, near the epicenter of plague in Kurdistan, Iran, on a piece of land bestowed by Manuchehr Gharagozlou, an Iranian friend of Dr. Baltazard. At this research center, currently called \\"The Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases\\", Dr. Baltazard and his perseverant colleagues conducted extensive research on plague and established this center as one of the international references for plague. Since 1952, research teams could base themselves in the area for months at a time and conduct detailed research on rodents under more favorable conditions. They were no longer required to carry their equipment throughout their missions. During those years, the integration of field and laboratory collaborations was a key to effective epidemiological actions and led to great research hypotheses. The extensive research by the teams of Pasteur Institute of Iran showed that rodents of the two types Meriones Persicus and Meriones libycus were the main natural reservoirs, unlike their resistance to plague; accordingly, they first proposed that the main reservoir of a disease should be sought amongst the most resistant, not the most sensitive, and such a theory is now accepted as a scientific fact. They also presented their scientific qualifications by publishing several scientific articles.Mollaret, H., et al., La peste de fouissement.

During the development of this research center, many international scientists visited the center, lecturing, studying and/or researching in their fields. In particular, Dr. Xavier Misonne, a Belgian rodentologist who investigated rodent life in IranMissone, X., The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. I.

Annales de Virologie, E, 1980. 131(2): pp. 185-200. In addition, the aerial photographs of Kurdistan and Hamadan were obtained from Iran's army and rodents' locations and the infection were mapped and reported and the first foundations of GIS were set. The research team carefully concentrated on the epizootic trend of the region. Figure 3: the aerial photograph of plague susceptible regions of Kurdistan, 1961, the trapping areas of rodents are marked by numbers. The achievements of Pasteur Institute of Iran regarding plague research attracted global attention and such a success motivated them to assign Iranians international plague research. The experts and researchers of Pasteur Institute of Iran, known as WHO experts, continued to conduct related research in many neighboring countries such as Turkey, Syria,Baltazard, M., et al., The Interepizootic Preservation of Plague in an Inveterate Focus.

Most of this research was financially supported by WHO. Figure 4: the expert committee on plague at the WHO offices in Geneva, 1969 (Dr. Mahmud Bahmanyar, the first on the right) In 1972, a WHO meeting on plague was held in this center with many participants from all over the world.

Mohammadi, and M. Hanif, Methods for rapid laboratory diagnosis of plague and an introdion of a new plague foci in Sarab (East Azarbaijan). Journal of Medical Council, 1978. 6 (4): pp. 326-322. It is noteworthy that one of the main responsibilities assigned to Pasteur Institute of Iran and the Akanlu Research Center in the following years was to conduct research about diagnosis and epidemiology of plague. Between 1978 and 2000, missions to monitor the plague in Kurdistan and Hamadan; proved plague infection amongst fleas and rodents in the evaluated regions. However, plague research was not seriously continued after 1992 and totally discontinued after 2000, resulting in that Akanlu Research Center, the only research center of Pasteur Institute of Iran on plague, was almost forgotten.  Akanlu Centre and research on other emerging and reemerging infectious diseases  220x220px Pasteur Institute of Iran has been designated to manage the infectious disease situation in Iran and when taking into account all its completed projects, the Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases can be regarded as the pioneer center for field epidemiology in Iran. The Epidemiology Department of Pasteur Institute of Iran and the Akanlu Research Center did researches on tularemia, recurrent fever, rabies and animal bites in addition to plague studies, the main research field of this center. In addition to close collaborations with other departments of the institute such as parasitology and rabies, the epidemiology department and Akanlu Research Center has conducted research in other fields such as hemorrhagic fevers,Ardoin, A. and Y. Karimi, A focus of thrombocytopenic purpura in East Azerbaidjan province, Iran (1974-1975)(author's transl).

The experts working in this Research Center, as WHO expert, were sent around the world to control outbreaks in addition to performing their important role in controlling a smallpox outbreak in this country. For instance, Dr. Mansur Shamsa was sent to Pakistan to complete a mission on behalf of WHO and Pasteur Institute of Iran; he played an important role in the control of the outbreak in Pakistan.  Studies related to tularemia  One of the other research fields of the Research Center for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases has been running researches on tularemia in Iran. Great research by Dr. Shamsa and his colleagues led to the first report of this disease among the domestic livestock and wildlife in Northwest and Eastern Iran. In this study, more than 4500 wild mammals, 200 sheep and cows were traced for the causative agent of tularemia in 47 locations in Iran. As a result, this study greatly contributed to the identification of wild mammals acting as reservoirs for many zoonotic diseases around the country.Arata, A., et al., First detection of tularaemia in domestic and wild mammals in Iran. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 1973. 49(6): pp. 597-603. The studies about the epidemiology of tularemia continued in the years thereafter as well. The first report of a human case of tularemia was in 1980 in Marivan, southwestern Kurdistan province.Karimi Y, Salarkia F, and G. MA, Tularemia: first human case in Iran. Journal of Medical Council of Iran 1981. 8(2): pp. 134-141.  New period of center‚Äôs activity  388x388pxA new period of research activities focused on the center began in 2010. The results of researches in this period were further reports of plague, tularemia and Q fever in Iran. After decades of lack of reporting about these diseases, the surveillance system of these diseases formed again. The domain of center's current activities is defined in three fields: research, education and services. The dedicated laboratories for rodentology studies, serology, molecular studies and culture, seminar halls and guest accommodation (for up to 40 persons) offer a suitable environment for research and education in this region. The center holds the national reference laboratory for plague, tularemia and Q fever, aims to be the WHO collaborating centre in near future and has conducted several studies on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases so far. = A -research activities =  A-1 Implementation of research projects  Results of carried out research projects managed by this center includes reports on plague in rodents and dogs in the western part of the country,Esmaeili, S., et al., Serologic Survey of Plague in Animals, Western Iran.

Early life Ruddock was born in Hastings, England, on 2 April 1895, one of eight children born to the Reverend David and Anne (n√©e Lush). When Ruddock was eight, the family moved to Wairoa, New Zealand, and her father became Archdeacon of Hawke's Bay in 1907. After her father died in 1920, her mother moved the family to Parnell, Auckland, where they lived in Anne Ruddock's parents' home, historic Ewelme Cottage. Ruddock attended St Margaret's College, Christchurch and received awards in botany, needlework and class work. She also began to play the violin while at the school. Ruddock lost both her brothers in World War I: Edward died in 1915 and Walter in 1917. In 1921, Ruddock went to England to study music at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

During his legal career, Koo represented several politicians. His own political career began with an unsuccessful campaign for the Taipei mayoralty in 2013. In 2016, he was elected a legislator at large representing the Democratic Progressive Party. Koo left the Legislative Yuan to lead the Ill- gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee. In 2017, he became chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission. Koo was appointed Secretary-General of the National Security Council in 2020. Early life Koo was born in Taipei in 1958, to Mainlander parents originally from Shanghai. He attended National Taiwan University before earning a master's degree in public service law from New York University. Koo passed the Taiwanese bar exam in 1983, and began teaching law at Chinese Culture University in 1993, a job he held until 2003. Legal career Koo worked for Formosa Transnational Attorneys at Law, a firm founded by Fan Kuang-chun and John Chen. While with the firm, Koo, Lee Fu- tien, and four other Taiwanese lawyers served as liaisons between taishang based in mainland China and the businesspeople's Chinese attorneys. He also mentored Su Chiao-hui and represented Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu during the 2004 presidential election. Other clients include Chao Chien-ming in a 2006 embezzlement scandal, and the Hung Chung-chiu family in 2013. Koo has also served as legal counsel for Lee Teng-hui and Tsai Ing-wen, as well as the student activists who led the 2014 Sunflower protests and the 2015 protest of curriculum guidelines. In 2014, he joined the defense team of , a man subject to the longest criminal case in Taiwanese judicial history who had been imprisoned for the murder of Lu Cheng in 1987. In December 2015, Koo, representing the Democratic Progressive Party as a whole, charged Kuomintang chairman Eric Chu with attempting to buy votes. He also acted as the DPP's legal counsel in a case against a group of KMT legislators who alleged that Tsai Ing-wen had engaged in land speculation. Political career In September 2013, Koo announced his intent to run for the mayoralty of Taipei as a member of the Democratic Progressive Party. A primary held in May 2014, after the Sunflower Movement, was won by Pasuya Yao, and Koo dropped out of the race. Yao later dropped out of the race, endorsing Ko Wen-je, who won the mayoral election as an independent candidate. Koo, then the director of the Judicial Reform Foundation, was selected for the Democratic Progressive Party's proportional representation ballot in November 2015. Listed forth on the ballot during the 2016 legislative election, he won a seat in the Legislative Yuan. In his time as legislator, he called for the establishment of a government commission on human rights. Koo also coauthored amendments to the Act Governing Relations with Hong Kong and Macau in an attempt to simply the process for political asylum-seekers from those areas to Taiwan. He also proposed an amendment to the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act, stating that people involved in the illegal drug trade should be treated for addiction prior to being put on trial. The Act Governing the Handling of Ill-gotten Properties by Political Parties and Their Affiliate Organizations, which he helped to write, was passed in July and Koo was named to a commission set up to investigate questionable assets in August. He stepped down from the Legislative Yuan to take the appointment, and was succeeded in office by Julian Kuo. Koo assumed the committee chairmanship despite the Kuomintang citing Article 20 of the Act, which requires nonpartisan committee members, in its objections to Koo's leadership. Koo named most of the committee members on 24 August, and the group was officially established on 31 August. Koo was appointed to the chairmanship of the Financial Supervisory Commission in September 2017, succeeding Lee Ruey-tsang on the same day that William Lai replaced Lin Chuan as premier.

It was discovered on 23 March 1992, by Japanese astronomers Kin Endate and Kazuro Watanabe at Kitami Observatory in Japan, and named after amateur astronomer Yoko Morishita.  Orbit and classification  Morishita is a S-type asteroid that orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,508 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, the body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation.  Photometry  In October 2010, a rotational lightcurve of Morishita was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave an exceptionally long rotation period of 972.8 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.82 magnitude, indicative for a non-spheroidal shape ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Morishita measures 5.656 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.152, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a shorter diameter of 3.49 kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Yoko Morishita (b. 1947), amateur astronomer and supporter of the Astronomical Society of Shikoku, where she has made many contributions to further the spread of astronomical awareness. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 April 2013 ().

Kashf al-Asrar is the first book that expresses Khomeini's political views.  Background  Ruhollah Khomeini wrote Kashf al-Asrar to answer questions about the credibility of Islamic and Shia beliefs that originated in a pamphlet called The Thousand-Year Secrets, which was written by Ali Akbar Hakamizada, who had abandoned clerical studies at Qum seminary. In 1934, Hakamizada began publishing a modernist journal titled Humayun that advocated reformation in Islam and criticized Islamic superstition and traditionalism. In 1943, Hakimzada wrote The Thousand-Year Secrets and invited Shia scholars to explain what he called the sect's superstitious beliefs. According to Khomeini's son Ahmad, one day when his father was going to Feyziyeh School, he encountered a group of seminary students discussing this pamphlet. Khomeini was worried the views of this pamphlet had infiltrated into the seminaries, and wrote Kashf al-Asrar to answer the pamphlet's questions. Kashf al-Asrar is the first book that expresses Khomeini's political views.  Content  The book defends against Hakamizada's attacks against such Shia practices as the mourning of Muharram, ziyara, the recitation of prayers composed by the Imams, clerical fostering of superstitious beliefs to perpetuate their own power, belief in the intercession of Muhammad and his descendants and the lack of any explicit mention of Imamate in the Quran. Khomeini also attacks Wahhabism and its \\"idolatrous\\" devotions, Bah√°'√≠ scholar M√≠rz√° Abu'l-Fadl and Shia scholar Shariat Sanglaji.Arjomand 1988, p. 161 Kashf al-Asrar consists of six chapters, the ordering of which mirrors the division of content in The Thousand-Year Secrets: \\"Tawhid\\", \\"Imamah\\", \\"The Clergy\\", \\"Government\\", \\"Law\\", and \\"Hadith\\". In the first chapter, \\"Tawhid\\", Khomeini answers criticisms of Shia Islam by Bah√°'√≠ Faith. The second chapter contains Hadith of Position, Hadith of the two weighty things, and proof of the concept of Imamah by verses of the Quran. The book's third, fourth, and fifth chapters include a discussion of government in the contemporary age. At the end of The Thousand- Year Secret, Hakamizada asks some challenging questions and invites responses from readers. At the beginning of the third chapter of Kashf al-Asrar, Khomeini responds to five of the nine questions asked in The Thousand-Year Secrets.  Reception  The Thousand-Year Secrets was supported by Ahmad Kasravi and Mirza Rida Quli Shari'at-Sanglaji (d. 1944), the Wahhabi- influenced Shia scholar. Along with the publication of the pamphlet, objections were raised by scholars and seminary students. According to Ayatollah Hossein Badala and Bagheri, some scholars decided to respond to it. One of the responses was written by Mehdi Al-Khalissi; Kashf al-Asrar was another answer to the pamphlet; Ruhollah Khomeini taught philosophy at that time. Qom Seminary selected Kashf al-Asrar as answers to Hakimzada's questions in The Thousand-Year Secrets.

Publication history  The comic strip was first published in the 1982 S√∫per Mortadelo magazine, issues #130 to #135. A point of interest is the fusion of the then-upcoming 1982 Soccer World Cup theme with the topic of Islamic terrorism, which was at that time still a \\"novelty\\". The terrorist leader mentioned to be behind the story's plot is a caricature of Muammar Gaddafi.  Plot  A band of Oriental terrorists decide to execute a strike against the U.S.A. using a terrible weapon: A soccer ball housing bio- engineered bacteria which continuously produce a gas that turns any who inhale it into a donkey. Due to a slight mishap during an attempted mid-air hijacking (since the plane passengers did not believe that the terrorist's hand grenade was real), the ball instead ends up near the Spanish coast, where it is unwittingly picked up by a number of boaters. Since the ball has somehow suffered a leak, it instantly turns its finders into donkeys. Once El S√∫per is informed of the situation, he assigns Mortadelo and Filem√≥n with retrieving the ball. However, since the ball is transferred to a multitude of different places, and because Mortadelo and Filem√≥n handle the ball somewhat carelessly, a lot of innocent people - including El S√∫per, Ofelia and Professor Bacterio - are turned into donkeys before they succeed. While Professor Bacterio is hardpressed to develop an effective antidote for this malady, the terrorist band repeatedly attacks the T.I.A. headquarters in order to get the ball back into their own hands. In an attempt to protect El S√∫per from the attackers, Mortadelo and Filem√≥n try to cover him with heavy furniture, only to have the floor collapse on top of the terrorists under the combined furniture's weight. As a final act, El S√∫per demands that Mortadelo and Filem√≥n finally destroy the ball; but in order to do that, Mortadelo decants the gas into a scuba tank set which El S√∫per intends to take to a diving trip. As a result, El S√∫per inhales a massive overdose of the gas and turns back into a donkey, resulting into one of the habitual furious chases for Mortadelo and Filem√≥n's hides.

It consists of a group of disabled and able-bodied Sudanese working on increasing the level of awareness around the issue of disability, and informing disabled individuals of their rights so they can participate in society as equals to other citizens. Goals There is a large number of disabled people in Sudan. In addition to natural factors that cause disability in all countries, the situation is exacerbated in Sudan by civil wars and its dire consequences as displacement, poverty, poor medical services and a look of disgust that haunts the disabled. This is making the situation of disabled persons in Sudan exceptionally poor compared to other countries because they suffer from discrimination and exclusion, as they are isolated from each other and society as a whole. Based on the above and in order to accelerate the improvement of the situation of the disabled in the Sudan the idea of a British Sudanese Association for people with disabilities was born to deal with the affairs of the disabled in the Sudan. The association is devoted to improving the situation of the disabled Sudanese and linking them to their counterparts in other countries to benefit from their experiences. It works as entity that combines the efforts of the disabled in the United Kingdom and Sudan to create favourable conditions for the establishment of their own organisations and accomplish their goals according to their needs and circumstances. Therefore, the most important goals of the British Sudanese Association for people with disabilities is to help the disabled to take advantage of their potential and engage in society as active members and helping them to live free from fear, discrimination and mistreatment. To keep working on that goal, a centre dedicated to studying the issues of disability inn Sudan was established .Among the tasks of the centre are the dissemination of public awareness about disability issues and working with decision-making circles in favour of persons with disabilities.

His feast day is March 30th. Biography Rieul de Senlis was perhaps one of the companions of Denis of Paris and Lucian of Beauvais who would have evangelized Senlis in the Oise. Rieul de Senlis and Regulus of Arles are sometimes confused. On this question, historians are divided. Basil Watkins says that they are probably the same person as Regulus of Arles.Basil Watkins The Book of Saints: A Comprehensive Biographical Dictionary 2015 0567664147 \\"Rembert Regulus (Rieul) of Senlis (St) {2,4} 30 March C4th. Allegedly a Greek and the first bishop of Senlis (France), he is also linked with Arles. \\" Some sources, such as the martyrology, say that Saint Rieul was bishop of Arles and he died in Senlis; others like the Bollandists, do not hesitate to settle the difficulty, making two saints Rieul, the one bishop of Arles, the other bishop of Senlis. The historian of Valois, Claude Carlier , finds the existence of relics in two different places, Arles and Senlis, proof, that the bishop of Arles and the bishop of Senlis are two different people. However, multiple relics frequently exist of the same saint. The relics The relics of Saint Rieul de Senlis, preserved in the cathedral, were analyzed in 1999 according to the technique of carbon 14.Croiz√© de Pourcelet, Marie-Th√©r√®se. \\"The tribulations of the relics of St-Rieul \\", Reports and memoirs 1998-99, Senlis, Society of history and archeology of Senlis, 2000, p. 207-220 It was concluded that there was a 65% probability that the owner died between 320 and 445 (compared to 12% probability for the period 260 - 320, and 20% for the period 445 - 535 ). If it is indeed the body of Rieul, it should delay the date of evangelization of the region of Senlis to the fourth century. This date is much more likely than that of the third century, which is too early for the region. Excavations of Marc Durand indicate that the Gallo-Roman temple in the Halatte forest near Senlis, was very active still in the third century, and was violently destroyed around 385 - 390 .

Callo served as an apprentice at a print store from the age of thirteen before joining Catholic associations in France. He was conscripted to serve during World War II and the Gestapo arrested him in 1944 for his Christian activities. He died in the camps after being forced to do long hours of labour. On account of the fact that he died in harsh camp conditions in hatred of his faith Pope John Paul II presided over his beatification on 4 October 1987. Life Marcel Callo was born in Rennes on 6 December 1921 as the second of nine children to Marcel Callo and Felicita Maria Giuseppina; one brother was Giovanni (who became a priest) and a sister was Maria Maddalena. Callo was known as a child for being a leader-like figure and for his perfectionist attitude. He was known for his good sense of humor as well as for his fondness of games such as ping pong and cards. He attended a range of schools in Rennes and also served as an altar server until the age of seven. Callo became a Scout at the age of ten in 1931 and considered himself to be as such for the remainder of his life; he left them at the age of eleven. Callo gained work as an apprentice at the age of thirteen on 1 October 1934 in a printing store in Rennes. Callo did not like to associate himself with fellow workers who swore or who told improper stories and aligned himself with fellow Christians. He joined the Young Christian Workers ‚Äì also known as the Jocists ‚Äì in 1935 that Joseph Leo Cardijn (future cardinal) had established. His mother approached Callo on one particular occasion and asked her son if he had an inclination to become a priest like his brother but a candid Callo responded to her: \\"I do not feel called to the priesthood; I think I do more good by remaining in the world\\". Following the Nazi invasion of France in 1940 during World War II he and his friends made trips to the same train station on a frequent basis in order to assist the refugees that were fleeing from Eastern Europe. He became engaged to Marguerite Derniaux (d. 1997) at the age of 20 but due to the war the couple never married though were engaged when Callo was 21; despite this Derniaux remained faithful to her fianc√©. The two also enacted a strict spiritual rule of life that included going to Mass and the frequent reception of the Eucharist. In the aftermath of the Rennes bombings ‚Äì on 8 March 1943 ‚Äì his sister Maria Maddalena died from injuries that she sustained during the attack. He was conscripted to serve during the war and his original intention was to flee but remembered that if he did so those he left back home would be arrested to coerce him. He was reluctant but agreed to serve and when conscripted said: \\"I'm leaving not as a worker but as a missionary in the service of my companions\\"; Callo departed on 19 March 1943 for his service and brought with him ‚Äì which he kept at all times ‚Äì his badges as both a Scout and a member of the Jocists. The Gestapo arrested Callo on 19 April 1944 due to his membership with the Jocists which was perceived to be an outlawed and secret order. The arresting officers told Callo that he was being taken because he was \\"too much of a Catholic\\" and was seen as a threat to the Nazi regime. He was sent to camps on 7 October 1944 in Gotha and then in Flossenb√ºrg; from there he was taken to the Gusen I and II parts of the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. It was there that Callo was placed through rigorous forced labor for a total of twelve hours where he was also abused and beaten. In the dawn of 19 March 1945 he died after contracting tuberculosis and a mix of other ailments such as dysentery. He was buried in a mass grave outside the walls of the camp and his remains never recovered. Colonel Tibodo ‚Äì who saw thousands die in the camps witnessed that of Callo's and said of it with emotion: \\"Marcel had the look of a saint\\"; Tibodo also testified for the beatification proceedings and said: \\"I have never seen in a dying man a look like his\\". Beatification Statue in Rennes. The beatification process commenced in Rennes in a diocesan process from 1 March 1968 until 19 March 1969 in order to evaluate his life as well as the work he was involved with and the manner in which Callo died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). This took place despite the fact that the formal introduction of the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 7 January 1982 in an act that confirmed upon Callo the posthumous title Servant of God. A second process however was dispensed and allowed for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to accept the process and decree it was valid on 9 January 1987 and commence the so-called \\"Roman Phase\\" in which Rome would begin its own line of investigation. The Positio was submitted to Rome for investigation in 1987 and after both theologians and the Congregation approved the case it was taken to the pope who confirmed on 1 June 1987 that Callo had indeed died because of others‚Äô hatred for his Christian faith; this meant that he could be beatified without a required miracle. John Paul II beatified Callo on 4 October 1987.

Huffman at the Chicago premiere of Saving Mes Aynak. Music Box Theatre. 2015. Brent Edward Huffman (born September 4, 1979) is an American director, writer, and cinematographer of documentaries and television programs, including Saving Mes Aynak (2015). His work has been featured on Netflix, The Discovery Channel, The National Geographic Channel, NBC, CNN, PBS, TIME, The New York Times and Al Jazeera America and Al Jazeera English and premiered at International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), and many other U.S. and international film festivals. He is also an associate professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University where he teaches documentary production and theory. Brent Huffman's \\"Saving Mes Aynak\\" has won over 30 major awards and has been broadcast on television in over 70 countries. It can currently be seen on Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and on Special Edition DVD with Icarus Films. His new documentary, The Iron Friendship examines China's economic relationship with Pakistan.  Career  Born in Spencer, Ohio, Brent E. Huffman studied filmmaking and worked closely with professors and documentary filmmaker Julia Reichert, Steve Bognar, and James Klein. As a student, Huffman worked as an editor on Bognar and Reichert‚Äôs Emmy award-winning documentary A Lion in the House. The filmmakers also let Huffman use their camera and sound equipment while he worked as a student on a documentary about the Warren County, Ohio, prison. This became his first documentary, Welcome to Warren: Guards and Inmates on Life in Prison, which won a special Award of Recognition by the Grand Jury of The Discovery Channel/American Film Institute‚Äôs SILVERDOCS Documentary Film Festival in Washington DC. Huffman graduated with summa cum laude honors from Antioch College, Yellow Springs, OH in 2002. From 2003 to 2005, while pursuing a master's degree in journalism with an emphasis on Documentary/Television Production from the Graduate School of Journalism at University of California, Berkeley, Huffman directed, produced, shot, and edited The Weight of the World (2005), about the growing popularity of weightlifting during the first presidential election in Afghanistan. This film was broadcast on PBS's FRONTLINE/World and Current TV. Huffman co-produced The Women's Kingdom (2006), a short documentary about the matriarchal society of Mosuo ethnic minority in China, with his wife Xiaoli Zhou. Featured on FRONTLINE/World on PBS, The Women's Kingdom went on to win the 33rd Student Academy Awards. Huffman went on to live and work for a year and a half in China filming ethnographic documentaries in remote areas for the China Exploration and Research Society (CERS). From 2006 to 2008, Huffman taught video production, technique and theory in visual journalism at the Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara, CA. Throughout his teaching stint, Huffman continued to create documentary films focusing on international topics pinned to China. The Colony (2010), exploring China‚Äôs new economic role in Africa, aired on Al Jazeera. The film screened in the academic and research context as well, with Huffman invited by the U.S. Embassy in Dakar, Senegal, to lead a symposium about China‚Äôs increasing presence in Senegal. With The Colony, Huffman gave lectures about China's role in Africa at USC's US/China Institute, Princeton University, and Columbia University. Before moving on as an associate professor at Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, Huffman covered Vortex 2, the world‚Äôs largest tornado research project, for NBC Universal and The Weather Channel. = Saving Mes Aynak = In 2007, China Metallurgical Group Corporation, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, bid $3.4 billion for the rights to mine deposits near the village of Aynak. The New York Times reported: \\"Over the next 25 years, it plans to extract about 11 million tons of copper ‚Äî an amount equal to one-third of all the known copper reserves in China.\\" Reading further reportages on The New York Times on the involvement of China and U.S. government in the mineral reserves in Afghanistan, Huffman began his research into this subject and began filming in Mes Aynak on his own in 2011. On top of the copper reserve in Mes Aynak, it turns out, is an archaeological excavation site, uncovering \\"thousands of Buddhist statues, manuscripts, coins, and holy monuments...Entire monasteries and fortifications...dating back as far as the third century,\\" according to a National Geographic reportage. However, the site was surrounded by danger: during his stay, Huffman was never allowed to stay in the Mes Aynak area due to the threat of the Taliban. Huffman went through substantial scrutiny and restrictions from the Afghan and U.S. officials: every time he visited the site, he had to go through the permission process from the Ministry of Culture, Kabul Police, and the local province. The Afghanistan-U.S. embassy declined to be interviewed for the film and did not allow American archaeologists working in Mes Aynak to be interviewed for the film. By 2012, Huffman's account of the struggles of archaeologists in Mes Aynak was published on CNN, an \\"Op-Doc\\" on The New York Times, NPR, the Tricycle Magazine, among others. Huffman traveled around universities and museums around the U.S. showing his footage from Mes Aynak. The footage was also used by the Smithsonian Museum to educate members of the U.S. State Department about the situation at the ancient Buddhist archaeological site in Mes Aynak. Huffman launched a Kickstarter campaign to help Afghan archeologists purchase digital cameras and computers for their facility and to help pay for the film‚Äôs production costs. The campaign raised more than $35,000 and helped the story of Mes Aynak reach a huge international audience, which resulted in online and street protests against the mining of Mes Aynak. With the donation from Kickstarter and a grant from MacArthur Foundation, Huffman finished the project, which became Saving Mes Aynak. In 2014, Saving Mes Aynak was invited by the President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, for a private screening. Due to dangers of Taliban and opposition to the demolition of the archaeological excavation site, China Metallurgical Group Corp has delayed its mining operation in Mes Aynak. In 2014, Kartemquin Films officially announced that it will be producing Saving Mes Aynak and the same year, the film had a world premiere at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), the largest documentary film festival in the world. In 2015, Saving Mes Aynak was broadcast on Al Jazeera America and Al Jazeera English, broadcast and screened throughout over 20 countries. As of 2016, Saving Mes Aynak continues to be shown widely in universities, museums, and film festivals across the U.S. and around the world. The main subject of the documentary Qadir Temori is now the director of the Afghan Institute of Culture, leading the effort with the Oriental Institute and the Afghanistan U.S. Embassy to create a satellite- based map database of Afghanistan‚Äôs cultural heritage sites and train young Afghans in the field of archaeology. The film remains free to watch for people in Afghanistan. In 2015, In an interview with Audience Everywhere, Huffman announced that he is working on a new project on China's presence in Pakistan.

It is the only Pteleopsis species to occur in Southern Africa. Its flowers are strongly scented and perceived by humans to be either 'honey-like' or 'cloying' or even 'stinky'. The timber is red, hard and durable, and used for furniture and construction. This is a dense, often multi-stemmed semi-deciduous small tree with a drooping habit up to 20 m tall. Bark is greyish-pink, and smooth, net-like in appearance. Leaves are opposite and simple, 10‚Äì95 mm x 6‚Äì35 mm, narrowly elliptical with acute apex and base; surface glabrous and occasionally glossy above; margins entire and may be wavy. Petiole is often hairy. Inflorescence axillary and some 45 mm long. Ellipsoid fruit with 2 or 3 wings, 10‚Äì25 mm x 5‚Äì17 mm. It is found on rocky hillsides and stony outcrops, in evergreen and riverine forest, from sea level up to 1600 m altitude, mainly along the east coast of Southern Africa. It occurs in savanna such as Baikiaea, mopane, and miombo (Brachystegia) woodlands, and ranges from northern Zululand, the Nwambiya Sandveld of the Kruger National Park, Mozambique, westwards to Botswana, Caprivi Strip, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and northwards to Malawi, Tanzania, and Kenya where it is very rare. This species is very like Pteleopsis anisoptera (Welw. ex M.A.Lawson) Engl. & Diels in appearance, and may yet prove to be closely related. Pteleopsis is intermediate in many characters between Combretum and Terminalia. Ethnic medicine Leaf sap is sometimes blended with that of Diospyros zombensis (B.L.Burtt) F.White, and taken to treat dysentery. It is also taken to ward off threatening abortion. A decoction of roots and chicken is taken to treat sterility, for venereal diseases, dysentery and excessive menstruation. A poultice is applied to sores. Leaves are cooked and eaten, and the fruits are considered edible. Livestock avoid the species. Leaves are eaten by the caterpillar Imbrasia lucida, which are picked and fried with onions in oil, or cooked and dried for later consumption. Phytochemicals Leaf extracts contain the pentacyclic triterpenoid taraxerol and show antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Leaf extracts also inhibited cancer cell lines MCF-12A, H157, WHC03 and HeLa. A methanolic root extract showed strong inhibitory effects on the T24 bladder cancer cells, but less so against the HeLa cervical cancer and MCF7 breast cancer. Root extracts showed antifungal activity against Candida glabrata and Candida krusei, and some activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. Species of Combretum, Pteleopsis and Terminalia are generally a rich source of drugs for treating tumors and fungal infections.

He was sent to race in Europe and was one of the best two-year-olds of his generation in 1997 when he won four of his seven races including the Acomb Stakes, the Beresford Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. In the following year he won the Dante Stakes but was beaten when favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club and ran unplaced in The Derby and the Irish Derby. He later raced in the United Arab Emirates and the United States but never won again. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland and Australia with little success. Background Saratoga Springs was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Ontario by Huntington Stud Farm. He was from the tenth crop of foals sired by El Gran Senor, an outstanding performer in Europe where his wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, 2000 Guineas and Irish Derby. El Gran Senor was not a prolific stallion but sired several other major winners including Rodrigo de Triano, Al Hareb, Belmez and Lit de Justice. Saratoga Springs' dam Population was an unraced, British-bred daughter of General Assembly and Prudent Girl who was a half-sister to Hethersett. In July 1996, the yearling colt was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $825,000 by the bloodstock agent Dermot \\"Demi\\" O'Byrne acting on behalf of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation. Saratoga Springs was sent to Europe and entered training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the details of the colt's ownership changed from race to race. He was usually described as being owned by Michael Tabor whilst on other occasions he ran for the partnership of Tabor and Susan Magnier. Racing career =1997: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Saratoga Springs started the 4/6 favourite for a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh Racecourse on 29 June. Ridden by Christy Roche he looked outpaced at half way but finished strongly and just failed to win, beaten a short head in a three-way photo finish by Two-Twenty-Two and Natalis who dead- heated for first. Two weeks later, the colt started 4/7 favourite for a similar event over seven furlongs at Gowran Park and recorded his first success, going clear of his opponents in the final furlong before being eased down by Roche to win by three quarters of a length from the John Oxx-trained filly Absoluta. On 26 July at the Curragh Saratoga Springs started odds-on favourite for a minor stakes race over seven furlongs in which he was ridden by Seamie Heffernan. After leading from the start he was tackled by the filly Tarascon in the last quarter mile and came out second best after a prolonged struggle, going down by half a length to his rival. The colt was then sent to England to contest the Acomb Stakes at York Racecourse on 19 August when he was equipped with a visor for the first time. Ridden by Mick Kinane he was among the leaders from the start, took the leade two furlongs out and drew away in the closing stages to win by five lengths from Chester House and the Godolphin runner Mutawwaj who dead-heated for second. The other beaten horses included Teapot Row and La-Faah who went on to win the Royal Lodge Stakes and the Horris Hill Stakes respectively. Saratoga Springs made his second visit to Britain when he was one of five colts to contest the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September. He started the 5/2 second choice in the betting behind the Henry Cecil-trained Daggers Drawn, the winner of the Richmond Stakes. Ridden again by Kinane, he tracked the leaders but looked somewhat outpaced in the closing stages and was beaten into third place behind Daggers Drawn and Docksider. On 18 October Saratoga Springs was matched against six opponents in the Group Three Beresford Stakes over one mile at the Curragh and started 7/4 favourite ahead of the Jim Bolger-trained Sabre Mountain. He raced in second before Roche sent him into the lead in last quarter mile and he stayed on well to win by four lengths from Hanzanar. On his final appearance of the year, Saratoga Springs was ridden by Kinane when he ran in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on 25 October. The 7/2 favourite was the Michael Stoute-trained Kilimnjaro with Saratoga Springs next in the betting on 9/2 alongside the previously undefeated Mudeer whilst the other five runners included Little Indian (winner of the Solario Stakes) and Mountain Song (third in the National Stakes). Saratoga Springs tracked the leaders Mountain Song set the pace before giving way to Craigsteel three furlongs out. The Canadian colt overtook Craigsteel approaching the final furlong and held off the strong late challenge of Mudeer to win by a short head with Mutamam a length away in third place. Mutamam's jockey Richard Hills lodged an objection against the first two finishers, but the result remained unaltered. After the race O'Brien said \\"All Saratoga does is eat and sleep. He's so laid back\\". =1998: three-year-old season= Saratoga Springs made his three-year-old debut in the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York on 13 May. He was ridden by Kinane and started the 4/1 third favourite behind Border Arrow, who had finished third to the O'Brien-trained King of Kings in the 2000 Guineas and the previously undefeated Dr Fong, whilst the other three runners were City Honours, Teapot Row and Greenlander. He was restrained at the rear of the field at Teapot Row set the pace before making a forward move early in the straight. He took the lead inside the final furlong and got the better of City Honours and Border Arrow to win by half a length and three quarters of a length. Eighteen days after his win at York, Saratoga Springs was sent to France and started the 2.7/1 favourite for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. After being held up by Kinane he made steady progress in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished fourth behind Dream Well, Croco Rouge and Sestino. In the Derby a week later he was the least fancied of the three O'Brien runners and started a 20/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field. Ridden by Willie Ryan he reached seventh place early in the straight but tired in the closing stages and finished tenth behind High-Rise who won by a short head and two and a half lengths from City Honours and Border Arrow. Walter Swinburn took the ride when the colt started 8/1 third favourite for the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 28 June. After racing in fifth place he could make no progress in the straight and finished sixth behind Dream Well. =1999: four-year-old season= In the autumn of 1998 Saratoga Springs was acquired for an undisclosed by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin stable and was sent to Dubai where he was trained by Saeed bin Suroor, with the Dubai World Cup as his target. On his first start for his new trainer he was ridden by Jerry Bailey when he contested the Dubai Turf Classic at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 28 March. He made no impression as he finished tailed off last of the eleven runners behind Fruits of Love. The colt was then transferred to the United States where Bob Baffert took over as his trainer. He finished third in an allowance race at Ellis Park Race Course in September but finished unplaced in his three subsequent starts, ending his racing career by finishing sixth in an allowance at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 5 December. Stud record At the end of his racing career Saratoga Springs was retired to become a breeding stallion. He was based at the Haras Du Mezeray in France and was also shuttled to stand in Australia but had little success in either location. His last foals were born in 2005.

He is currently a member of the Rockingham Flames of the State Basketball League (SBL). Early life and career Born in Melbourne, Victoria, Robbins played his junior basketball in the suburb of Dandenong. He represented Victoria in national competitions in Under 14s in 1998, Under 16s in 2000, and Under 18s in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, he was a member of the Australian team at the Albert Schweitzer Tournament and the Oceania Junior Men's Qualification Tournament. Then in 2003, he was part of the history-making world championship-winning Australian Emus Under 19 team that included the likes of Andrew Bogut, Damian Martin and Matthew Knight, and coached by Rob Beveridge. Robbins had a one-game stint with the SEABL's Dandenong Rangers in 2001, before joining the team in 2003 and playing in 21 games. Professional career =Victoria Giants and Cairns Taipans= Following the 2003 SEABL season, Robbins joined the Victoria Giants of the National Basketball League (NBL) for the 2003‚Äì04 season. He played sparingly for the Giants as a rookie, scoring just 11 total points in 13 games. He returned to the SEABL in 2004, joining the Knox Raiders and going on to win the SEABL's Australian Youth Player of the Year for the South Conference. Following the 2004 SEABL season, Robbins moved north and joined the Cairns Taipans for the 2004‚Äì05 NBL season. In 25 games for the Taipans, he averaged 1.6 points and 1.1 rebounds per game. He then returned to Knox for the 2005 SEABL season and earned back-to-back Australian Youth Player of the Year honours for the South Conference. Robbins had another standout season as he finished with averages of 13.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.8 steals per game (second best in Conference). Not known for his offensive prowess, Robbins recorded 20 or more points two times during the 2005 season, with a season-best game of 24 points, 8 rebounds, 9 assists and 3 steals against the Mount Gambier Pioneers in his last regular season game. =Perth Wildcats= Early years After not receiving any NBL contract offers for the 2005‚Äì06 season, Robbins moved to Perth in 2006 and joined the Willetton Tigers of the State Basketball League (SBL). Following the 2006 SBL season, Robbins joined the Perth Wildcats for the 2006‚Äì07 NBL season and became a tremendous servant of the club. In his first season as a Wildcat, Robbins averaged 3.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 34 games. He became a crowd favourite and impressed with his work ethics, as his gritty actions on court earned him the nickname \\"Angry Ant\\". He subsequently returned to the Willetton Tigers for the 2007 SBL season. Robbins played 67 games over his first two seasons as a Wildcat, increasing he averages to 6.1 points, 2.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 2007‚Äì08, but was restricted to just three appearances in 2008‚Äì09 due to a knee injury. Championship and co- captaincy Robbins returned to full health for the 2009‚Äì10 season and formed a tremendous point guard duo with Damian Martin, helping the club win a record-breaking fifth NBL Championship. In the 2‚Äì1 grand final series win over the Wollongong Hawks, Robbins played through broken ribs, a calf tear and sore hips to drag Perth across the line. In 32 games for the Wildcats in 2009‚Äì10, he averaged 4.5 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals per game. He was then named co-captain for the 2010‚Äì11 season and led his team from the front to another playoff appearance, this time a thrilling semi-final series loss in three games to the New Zealand Breakers. He averaged 5.4 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals in 31 games during the 2010‚Äì11 season. Robbins returned to the SBL in 2011, joining the Wanneroo Wolves and helping the team win the championship alongside Wildcats' teammate Greg Hire. In 15 games for the Wolves in 2011, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.1 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 2.3 steals per game. He went on to have a career-best season for the Wildcats in 2011‚Äì12, celebrating his 200th NBL game in Game 1 of the semi- final series against the Gold Coast Blaze, and averaging a career-high 7.0 points per game. The Wildcats made it back to the Grand Final in 2012, where they were defeated 2‚Äì1 by the New Zealand Breakers. In 34 games for the Wildcats in 2011‚Äì12, he also averaged 2.9 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game. Following a successful stint with the Wanneroo Wolves in 2011, Robbins returned to the side for the 2012 season but played in just seven games, averaging 10.0 points, 5.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.4 steals per game. Final season Off-season wrist surgery forced Robbins to miss the first three weeks of the Wildcats' 2012‚Äì13 season, but upon returning to action, he managed just eight games before his long-running battle with various injuries began impeding on his ability to perform. Consequently, on 11 December 2012, he announced his retirement from the NBL effective immediately, citing his ailing body and a fatigued mind were the main reasons in his decision to walk away from basketball. He continued on with the team in an advisory role, but following an Achilles injury to Damian Martin in Game 2 of the Wildcats' semi- final series against the Wollongong Hawks, Robbins came out of retirement in April to fill in the back-up point guard role for the 2013 Grand Final series against the New Zealand Breakers. He played in both games of the Wildcats' 2‚Äì0 series loss to the Breakers, finishing his NBL career with 215 games and averages of 4.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. =Continuing on in the SBL= Robbins' 2013 NBL Grand Final return sparked a want to continue playing at a lower level, and just days after completing the NBL season with the Wildcats, Robbins joined the Wanneroo Wolves for the rest of the 2013 State Basketball League season. He played an important role on the Wolves' squad, leading them back to the Grand Final where they lost to the Lakeside Lightning. In 20 games for the Wolves in 2013, he averaged 4.7 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. After not playing for the Wolves in 2014, in April 2015, he re-joined the team. He left the team in early July prior to the playoffs. In 10 games, he averaged 3.0 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists and 1.3 steals per game. In October 2018, Robbins came out of retirement to sign with the Rockingham Flames for the 2019 SBL season. He came into the season six kilograms lighter than he was when he was with the Wildcats. A hamstring injury suffered during pre-season forced him to miss the start of the regular season. He made his debut for the Flames in round nine. He went on to miss the back-end of the season, including the finals, with an Achilles injury. Coaching career In December 2016, Robbins was appointed assistant coach for the Joondalup Wolves' WSBL team for the 2017 season. He continued on in the role in 2018, and had the responsibility as head coach for a large chunk of the season with coach Craig Friday unavailable due to his duties with the national wheelchair team. Personal In 2013, Robbins started working part-time as a project officer at the Fremantle Police and Community Youth Centre (PCYC). The centre's Streetball program, which Robbins began co-ordinating, was developed in 2012 to combat anti-social behaviour in the area. Robbins also began studying psychology and counselling at Edith Cowan University in 2013. Robbins is the brother-in-law of Wildcats and SBL teammate Greg Hire, with the pair having both married sisters.

The church is part of the properties protected by the Superintendent of Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism.  History  The original church was built in the eleventh century in pure Romanesque architecture. The church depended on the powerful Montmajour Abbey belonging to the Order of Saint Benedict. In the 15th and 16th century the building was enlarged and received the wooden statue of Sant'Ampelio that appears on the altar. The crypt, which is illuminated by small windows overlooking the sea, has a block of La Turbie stone, which, according to a legend, was the bed of Saint Ampelio. Still according to that legend, Saint Ampelio died right on his stone bed on October 5 428. After the uprising of 1140, the Republic of Genoa decided to punish the city by depriving the population of the relics of the saint and moved them in the Church of St. Stephen, in the more faithful city of Sanremo. On 14 May 1258 the city of Genoa decided to move back the relics, this time at the Abazzia di Santo Stefano which is located in Genoa. It was at this time that it was decided to appoint Saint Ampelio patron of blacksmiths. In 1947, the archbishop of Genoa, Giuseppe Siri, finally decided to return the relics to Bordighera. The saint‚Äôs relics were loaded on a boat and came to Bordighera on August 16. His remains were brought in procession to the Church of St. Mary Magdalen (Bordighera) and placed in the second chapel on the right side. The chapel contains a glass case in which there is a wax statue containing the relics of the saint. The statue and the frescoes decorating the chapel (1947), are the work of the Bordighera painter Giuseppe Balbo. In 2014, works began on the restoration of the church, which ended with the re-opening to the public on May 24, 2015. The church is still operating with the celebration of Masses and weddings.  Celebrations  Saint Ampelio, which is the city's patron saint, is celebrated on May 14, the day in which the city of Sanremo was deprived of the precious relics. The celebrations start a few days before with various events and reach their peak on the 14th with the procession and the fireworks taking place at Cape Saint Ampelio. Saint Ampelio was chosen as the patron saint of the city, not only because he chose the Cape as his permanent home, but also because, according to the legend, he planted the first seeds of Date palm that he had brought from his native Egypt It is therefore thanks to Saint Ampelio that the Ligurian town can claim the title of \\"Queen of palms\\".

Only a small portion survives as today‚Äôs Monet gardens, which are located in Via Domenico Tumiati, and in some private properties (Villa Schiva, Villa Palmizi, Villa Mariani, etc). The remainders of the Moreno Gardens and Villa Palmizi are part of the properties protected by the Superintendent of Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy).  History  The Moreno Gardens, quoted several times by the Charles Garnier, the painter Claude Monet and many other visitors to the city, were very large and rich in botanical varieties. The gardens started almost from the Via Aurelia, rose towards the Villa Moreno and came close to Via dei Colli. They were so impressive that many tourists asked to visit them. The '\\"Italia Geografica Illustrata\\" published in 1881, says \\"... the Moreno gardens are not only the most beautiful and most delightful location of the Mediterranean, but also one of the most beautiful and famous gardens of Europe.\\" The extent of the park was impressive, it reached 80 hectares of green, to be compared with the current Gardens of Vatican City measuring 23 hectares.Villa pittore Mariani Francesco Moreno, French consul in Bordighera, was a wealthy merchant of olive oil. He and his father Vincenzo built the house that bore their name, and filled the gardens of all the exotic varieties that they were able to import. The gardens, in addition to native plants such as lemons, mandarins, oranges, olive trees, were enriched with Pinus canariensis, Salisburia adiantifolia (Ginkgo biloba), Araucaria excelsa, Latania Bourbon, agave, aloe, yucca and a Coripha australis, synonymous with Livistona chinensis. Unfortunately, upon the death of Francesco Moreno, in 1885, his wife moved to France to be reunited to the three daughters, who as a result of marriages had moved to Marseille. The villa, with its gardens, was sold to the municipality. The large gardens were divided up and sold. The municipality did prolong the via Romana, despite the opposition of numerous personalities including Ludwig Winter, and this resulted in the splitting of the prestigious gardens. Currently only a tiny portion still remains visible to the public, as the current Monet gardens in Via Domenico Tumiati. In this green area you can still admire a giant model of Cocculus Lurifolius. Another small part of the original gardens was incorporated by two properties: Villa Palmizi (Via Romana 15), which retains the original core of the villa Moreno, and Villa Schiva (via Romana 18) where you can still admire the highest Pinus Canariensis of Europe. The tree, which was planted in 1830 is about 36 meters high. This magnificent monumental plant is still visible from the street. The tree was surveyed and is listed by the Corpo Forestale delle Stato. Noteworthy are also the Ginkgo biloba and Jubaea spectabilis, a slow-growing palm. Other parts of the Moreno gardens are located in the villas built along the hillside. Villa Mariani preserves intact a portion of the ancient Moreno gardens, when visiting the villa one can still see the same olive tree painted by Claude Monet in \\"Study of olive trees\\" and the same view painted in \\"View of Ventimiglia\\". The tree heritage of Bordighera was truly exceptional, in 1869 Gerolamo Molinari in his book \\"Cenni storici sulla Bordighera, suo territorio e clima\\" (\\"A brief history of Bordighera, its territory and its climate\\") estimated it at more than 100,000 plants including olive, citrus and palm trees. He wrote that only counting lemon and orange trees there were some 36,000 trees without counting the other citrus fruits. It is easy to understand why the palm trees that now adorn the famous \\"Promenade des Anglais\\" in Nice, and other walks of the French coast, are from Bordighera.  Trivia  During his stay in Bordighera, the painter Claude Monet asked his friend Durand-Ruel to intercede for him, to get him permission to visit the Moreno gardens. Monet wrote: \\"Here lives a certain Mr. Moreno, who owns a wonderful property, but one cannot visit it without a recommendation. I would be very obliged if you could get me a permission to visit.‚Äù Monet got the permission and painted numerous paintings which now belong to private collections and museums. The most well-known are: \\"Bois d'oliviers au jardin Moreno\\" (1884), \\"Jardins de la Villa Moreno\\" (1884), \\"Jardins Moreno √† Bordighera\\" (1884).

The limits of the genus and its distribution have long been confused; it is closely related to the genus Aphonopelma. Sericopelma species are among the largest found in Central America. They can be kept as pets, although at least one species has been described as \\"very aggressive\\". Description Spiders in the genus Sericopelma are some of the largest found in Central America. Males have bodies long, females are somewhat longer at . They can be kept as pets in terraria, although S. melanotarsum is described as \\"very aggressive\\". Characters that distinguish species of the genus Sericopelma from other theraphosids found in the same localities include the following. The carapace is longer than wide, with a deep transverse pit (fovea) and distinct grooves radiating from it. The femur of the fourth leg has a dense pad of feathery (plumose) hair on the side facing away from the head of the animal (retrolateral); the metatarsus of the same leg has a divided and reduced trace of tuft-like (scopulate) hairs at the end furthest from the body. The first leg lacks stridulatory hairs. Females have spermathecae with a single lobe, expanded at the apex to form a P-shape in cross-section. Males lack tibial spurs and their palpal bulbs have an embolus of a characteristic shape. Taxonomy Sericopelma was initially described by Anton Ausserer in 1875 as a subgenus of Eurypelma (now Avicularia) with the type species E. rubronitens. It was given full generic status by Simon in 1892. Until the middle of the 20th century only males were known by formal descriptions. The genus as a whole was described in 2015 as \\"poorly defined\\". Confusion with genera such as Brachypelma has been frequent; two species were transferred from that genus in 2015. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2016 produced the cladogram shown below, showing that Sericopelma is embedded in the genus Aphonopelma, as the latter is currently circumscribed. It is likely that generic boundaries will change with further research. =Species= , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: *Sericopelma angustum (Valerio, 1980) ‚Äì Costa Rica *Sericopelma commune F.

Winston is also the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the South Pacific basin. The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7 February 2016, when it was located to the northwest of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed as it moved southeast, acquiring gale-force winds by 11 February. The following day, it underwent rapid intensification and attained ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). Less favourable environmental conditions prompted weakening thereafter. After turning northeast on 14 February, Winston stalled to the north of Tonga on 17 February. Due to a change in higher level steering, the storm drifted back to the west. In the process, Winston again rapidly intensified, reaching Category 5 intensity on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale on 19 February. The storm passed directly over Vanua Balavu, where a national record wind gust of 306 km/h (190 mph) was observed. The cyclone reached its peak intensity on 20 February, with ten-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) and a pressure of 884 hPa (mbar; 26.10 inHg), shortly before making landfall on Viti Levu, Fiji. Thereafter, the storm slowly weakened within a less favourable environment; the system turned southeast during this time, though remained well away from Fiji. It later degenerated into a remnant low, with some subtropical characteristics, on 24 February as it turned to the west and later northwest. The system persisted for more than a week over the Coral Sea before ultimately moving over Queensland, Australia and dissipating on 3 March, 26 days after being classified a tropical disturbance. In advance of the storm's arrival in Fiji, numerous shelters were opened, and a nationwide curfew was instituted during the evening of 20 February. Striking Fiji at Category 5 intensity on 20 February, Winston inflicted extensive damage on many islands and killed 44 people. Communications were temporarily lost with at least six islands, with some remaining isolated more than two days after the storm's passage. A total of 40,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and approximately 350,000 people‚Äîroughly 40 percent of Fiji's population‚Äîwere significantly impacted by the storm. Total damage from Winston amounted to FJ$2.98 billion (US$1.4 billion). The nation's government declared a state of emergency on 20 February, which remained in place for 60 days. Immediately following the cyclone, the governments of Australia and New Zealand provided logistical support and relief packages. In the following weeks, a coalition of international support, including intergovernmental agencies, brought tens of millions of dollars in aid and hundreds of tons of supplies to residents in Fiji. Background Though frequented by tropical cyclones in general, the main islands of Fiji‚ÄîViti Levu and Vanua Levu‚Äîare seldom impacted by intense storms like Winston. Before Winston, the strongest storm to affect the main islands since records began in 1941 was Evan in December 2012, which skirted the western coast of Viti Levu as a Category 4 system on both the Australian scale and the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Also before Winston, the strongest storm to make landfall on either Viti Levu or Vanua Levu was Nigel in 1985, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) and one-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph), Category 3 on both scales. Winston is the deadliest storm to affect the nation of Fiji since Cyclone Meli in 1979, which claimed 53 lives. The relative lack of strong tropical cyclones affecting the capital city of Suva, located along the southeastern coast of Viti Levu, led to complacency among residents. Many assume that strong storms are confined to northern and western areas. With Winston approaching Fiji from the east and directly threatening Suva as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, Angela Fritz of The Washington Post called the storm a worst-case scenario. Meteorological history =Origins and initial peak intensity= On 7 February 2016, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 09F, which had developed about northwest of Port Vila, Vanuatu. Over the next few days the system moved southeast and gradually developed further within a favourable environment. On 10 February, the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 11P, while it was located about to the west-northwest of Suva, Fiji. The FMS upgraded it to Category 1 status on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and assigned it the name Winston early on 11 February; at this time the storm was situated roughly west- northwest of Suva, Fiji. Embedded within a northwesterly deep layer mean flow, the system tracked southeast. Around 12:00 UTC on the same day, Winston intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone, as a small, well-defined eye developed within deepening convection. Winston reaching its initial peak intensity, southeast of Vanuatu on 12 February Situated within a very favourable environment‚Äîfeaturing sea surface temperatures of , robust upper- level outflow, and light to moderate wind shear‚ÄîWinston rapidly intensified on 12 February, becoming a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone by 06:00 UTC, and then a Category 4 cyclone only six hours later. The system presented a well- defined eye enveloped by deep convection, and it reached its initial peak intensity at 18:00 UTC, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and the JTWC estimated one-minute maximum sustained winds at 215 km/h (130 mph), classifying it as a Category 4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Soon thereafter, increasing wind shear prompted weakening; convection waned and became increasingly ragged in appearance. On 14 February, Winston turned to the northeast as a subtropical ridge positioned itself to the north. =Weakening and northeast turn= Persistent wind shear displaced convection from the center of Winston, leaving its circulation partially exposed. As a result, the system degraded below severe tropical cyclone status by 00:00 UTC on 15 February. Conditions became more favourable for development on 16 February when shear relaxed over the cyclone. A prominent banding feature wrapped into the circulation that day, marking the start of reintensification. An eye reformed later that day within increasing convection, and Winston regained severe tropical cyclone intensity by 18:00 UTC. The storm's core became increasingly compact and defined as it strengthened, and a central dense overcast became established on 17 February. Later that day, Winston entered a region of weak steering currents and the storm became nearly stationary. The storm's eye became more readily apparent late on 17 February, as it doubled back to the west. =Peak intensity and Fiji landfall= Joe Munchak describes the features of Tropical Cyclone Winston. A strengthening ridge to the south propelled Winston west by 18 February, directing the intensifying cyclone at Fiji. The storm's eye grew in size that day, and upper-level outflow became more defined. Winston's overall structure became increasingly symmetric, and the system acquired traits of an annular tropical cyclone. Another period of rapid intensification took place on 19 February as the storm's wide eye became surrounded by intense convection. Winston acquired Category 5 status‚Äîthe highest level on the Australian intensity scale‚Äîby 06:00 UTC, with ten-minute sustained winds reaching 205 km/h (125 mph). Fueled by nearly perfect conditions for intensification, Winston deepened further and the JTWC estimated it to have acquired one-minute sustained winds of 270 km/h (165 mph) by 18:00 UTC, classifying it as a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. Around this time, the cyclone passed directly over the small island of Vanua Balavu. There, a weather station recorded sustained winds of 233 km/h (145 mph) and a gust of 306 km/h (190 mph) before being destroyed; both values constitute a national record for Fiji. Passing just south of Vanua Levu, Winston achieved its record intensity early on 20 February with ten-minute sustained winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) and a pressure of 884 hPa (mbar; 26.10 inHg). It was operationally estimated with ten-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph) and a pressure of 915 hPa (mbar; 27.02 inHg). The JTWC estimated Winston with one-minute sustained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph). At peak intensity, it revealed a fairly symmetric convective structure with a 25 km (15 mi) round eye, under low vertical wind shear easily offset by strong divergence aloft; moreover, sea surface temperatures remained warm, near . Winston soon made landfall in the Rakiraki District on Viti Levu at peak intensity, making it the only known Category 5 storm, on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir-Simpson scale, to directly impact Fiji, and therefore the most intense storm on record to strike the nation. It also marked the strongest landfall by any cyclone in the South Pacific basin, and one of the strongest landfalls worldwide. Despite deteriorating slightly while crossing the northern portion of Viti Levu, Winston remained well-organised, reforming a ragged and cloud-filled eye after re-emerging into open waters. =Final weakening and demise= Winston east of Queensland, with subtropical characteristics on 27 February Still under favorable conditions, Winston maintained intensity until early on 21 February, when upwelling of cooler waters beneath the decelerating cyclone caused it to weaken into a Category 4 cyclone. On 22 February, Winston sharply recurved south-southeastwards as the primary steering mechanism shifted from a ridge retrograding westwards to a ridge building to the east; moreover, dry air hindered reintensification. Very strong vertical wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures resulted in steady weakening, and WInston dropped below severe tropical cyclone intensity on 23 February. Later, the low-level circulation center became fully exposed with shallow convection sheared to the south. As the system weakened, the relatively shallow subtropical ridge began to steer it southwestwards. Late on 24 February, when Winston entered TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility, the JTWC issued the final warning and indicated subtropical characteristics, citing the weakening mid-level warm core and the expanding wind field. MetService claimed that Winston transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New Caledonia with gale-force winds at 00:00 UTC on 25 February, yet the JTWC continued to classify Winston as a subtropical system. On 26 February, beneath an upper- level low which produced subsidence aloft and high vertical wind shear, Winston revealed a strong low-level warm core and a weak upper-level cold core. The post-tropical cyclone moved into the Australian region basin in the afternoon, where it began to weaken once again. Although Winston began to move northwestwards and track over warmer sea surface temperature since 27 February, unfavourable upper-level conditions as well as dry air prevented reintensification. The system continued to track off the coast of Queensland, Australia as a weak and shallow system. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported that Winston had eventually transitioned into a tropical low and made landfall over the coast north of Cairns, at 1200 UTC on 3 March, locally at night. Winston soon degenerated into a trough over land. Impact =Effects in Fiji= Winston making landfall in Viti Levu on 20 February On 14 February, the FMS began issuing tropical cyclone warnings for the southern Lau Islands of Fiji. These gradually expanded in coverage through 15 February, but were discontinued on 16 February, as Winston moved away from the nation. Warnings were resumed on 18 February, after Winston doubled back toward Fiji, and were issued for the northern and eastern islands. Most of the northern islands in the storm's immediate path were placed under hurricane warnings on 19 February. All shelters across the Southern Lau Islands, Koro Island, and Taveuni were opened on 19 February; more than 700 shelters opened across the entirety of Fiji.  * The Republic of Fiji Military Forces were placed on standby for relief efforts. A state of emergency was declared during the afternoon of 20 February, and remained in place until 20 April. A nationwide curfew was enacted starting at 6:00 p.m. local time. Public transportation was suspended across Viti Levu, and the Fiji Roads Authority strongly advised residents to avoid travel unless necessary. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama called the storm \\"an ordeal of the most grievous kind\\". Striking the nation on 20 February, Winston brought widespread damage to numerous islands. Approximately 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 people lost power, including the entirety of Vanua Levu, as hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines. Communications with Vanua Balavu, Lakeba, Cicia, Nayau, Taveuni, and Qamea were lost on 20 February. Contact with Vanua Balavu had yet to be established as of the evening of 22 February. Landline telephone service was lost on Matuku Island. A total of 44 people were killed across the nation: 21 in the Western Division, 15 in the Eastern Division, 6 in the Central Division, and 2 in the Northern Division. An additional 126 were injured. An estimated 350,000 people‚Äîthe nation's total population was 837,721 as of the 2007 census‚Äîwere affected by the storm. A home largely destroyed by the storm in Tailevu Province Fiji's Eastern Division was the first to be struck by Winston, with many islands sustaining catastrophic damage. Entire communities were destroyed and approximately 40,000 people required immediate assistance. Koro Island sustained severe damage, with schools destroyed and many structures losing their roofs. Kade Village was leveled, with nearly all structures destroyed. One individual died in Nabasovi when his home collapsed, and twelve people were injured in Nabuna. Another woman on the island later died in the hospital from injuries she sustained. A total of 788 homes were destroyed and 234 were damaged across Koro Island, rendering more than 3,000 people homeless. Significant damage was reported across Ovalau, where maximum water run-up reached . Across Taveuni Island, 722 homes were destroyed and 837 were damaged at an estimated cost of FJ$11.2 million (US$5.29 million). The two main ports on Taveuni were severely damaged and largely rendered unusable. Southern areas of the island became isolated when a bridge was destroyed. A communication tower on Mago Island, owned by Mel Gibson, collapsed. In Lomaiviti Province alone, the storm created 42,000 tons of debris. On Viti Levu, strong winds destroyed at least two homes in Waidamu; the Waidamu River also topped its banks and flooded nearby communities. In Drauniivi village, 64 homes were completely destroyed and 70 more sustained damage. Hundreds of homes were destroyed in and around Rakiraki Town, with the area described as a scene of devastation and despair by the Fiji Times. The southern coast of Vanua Levu was battered by a significant storm surge which inundated areas up to inland near Tacilevu Village. Maximum wave run-up reached in Nukubalavu. Throughout Fiji, a total of 40,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The Western Division accounted for the majority of damage, with 6,954 homes destroyed and 11,234 damaged. This left approximately 131,000 people in need of immediate shelter assistance. In addition, 229 schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Total damage from the storm amounted to FJ$2.98 billion (US$1.4 billion). However, despite the massive damage caused by Winston, the main tourism sector was largely spared. =Other South Pacific nations= Large swells in Gold Coast, Queensland injured multiple people and prompted the closure of beaches Impacting Tonga twice within the span of a few days, Winston caused significant damage across northern Tonga. Approximately 2,500 people sought refuge in shelters. The first passage of the storm resulted in mostly crop damage while the second brought greater structural damage. At least 10 homes were destroyed and 200 more were damaged. Agriculture sustained significant damage, with 85‚Äì95 percent of the banana crop and most of the vanilla crop on Vava'u lost. Winston also affected Niue on 16 February; the FMS also issued tropical cyclone and damaging heavy swell warnings for the island nation.https://www.webcitation.org/6fMzj4znk?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WWNE40-NFFN_201602161500.htm The nation of Tonga also received money and aid as well as medical supplies from New Zealand, which also provided 8,000 people with clean water. Australia also provided assistance to Tonga, including the distribution of A$300,000 worth of humanitarian supplies through the Tonga Red Cross Society, two surveillance and assessment aircraft, and two disaster management experts from the Australian Civilian Corps to aid in relief efforts. Large swells‚Äîup to in height‚Äîfrom the remnants of Winston affected southern Queensland, Australia. Beaches at Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast were closed on 26 and 27 February due to dangerous conditions. At least 15 people sustained injuries, ranging from dislocated shoulders to broken legs, due to rough conditions. A bodyboarder was reported missing near Tallebudgera; a helicopter search failed to locate anyone and the search was called off until a missing person report was filed. Severe storms on 29 February associated with the outer bands of Winston's remnants brought locally heavy rains to parts of Queensland. of rain fell in Garbutt, while of rain was observed in Townsville in the space of 1 hour. On 3 March heavy rain began to fall in north Queensland as Winston's remnants moved ashore near Cairns. Accumulations reached in the small town of Feluga. Aftermath The eye of Winston over Koro Island on February 20 Cyclone Winston's devastating impact across Fiji rendered tens of thousands homeless, and prompted a major international humanitarian response. An estimated 350,000 people (40 percent of the nation's population) were moderately or severely affected by the storm, including 120,000 children. Approximately 250,000 people required water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance due to power outages and damaged infrastructure. Through the evening of 26 February, approximately 62,000 people were housed evacuation centres across the country, primarily in the Western Division. This number steadily fell to 29,237 by 4 March, though thousands more stayed with relatives. The Governments of Australia, France, and New Zealand quickly responded with a large-scale relief effort within days of the storm's passage. Several other nations provided donations, supplies and funds, as did various international organizations. =Local= All schools across Fiji suspended classes for at least a week, two weeks for those in the hardest-hit areas because of severe damage to the educational infrastructure. Hundreds of schools resumed activities on 29 February. All but 23 schools resumed classes by 8 March across the nation. In Labasa, two people were arrested for breaking curfew and others were reprimanded. The main airport serving the country, Nadi International Airport, was closed as a result of the cyclone. It was re-opened two days after the storm to allow the humanitarian supplies to be received and tourists to leave. The nation's government deployed two ships to Koro Island carrying assessment teams and emergency supplies. Rakiraki Town was shut down to travel at 7:30 a.m. local time on 23 February to allow crews to clear debris from roads. A school destroyed by the storm in Tailevu Province The Fiji Electricity Authority estimated that it would take three weeks to restore service to most of the Western Division. Digicel set up battery charging stations in Suva on 22 February. The company quickly restored telephone service to the main islands within two days of the storm. The spread of breeding grounds for mosquitos brought on by the storm led to an increase in dengue fever cases, with 131 incidents reported after Winston's passage.

Early life and education Benn was the first son of Robert Benn, a linen draper of St Nicholas Cole Abbey, London. He had a sister, Anne, who married Edward Goodwyn of Dorking. He matriculated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, in January 1584, enrolled at the Middle Temple in 1583, and took Batchelor of Arts at Oxford in 1587. Career Benn was called to the bar in 1594, practising in Chancery. Benn was appointed Recorder of Kingston in 1610, raised to the bench and elected Middle Temple autumn reader in 1612, lecturing on the Forcible Entry Act 1429. Benn was knighted in London on 15 September 1615 at Hyde Park on James I's return to London from Scotland. He was appointed Recorder of London the following year. In January 1618 Benn was expelled from commons at the Middle Temple for offending Lord Chief Justice Sir Henry Montagu. =Essays= Some manuscripts of Benn's works survive including a collection of about seventy essays held at Bedfordshire County Record Office. Benn's style is noted to be more deferential towards the supremacy of the King, harking back to an Elizabethan tradition and contrasting with attitudes of some of his Jacobean contemporaries. The subjects covered in the essays are wide-ranging and reflect Benn's personal views. One is entitled Of preparations towards Mariadg and contains advice to his then new-born daughter, Amabella. citing: Family Benn married Jane Evelyn in about 1601. Several sources state she was the daughter of John Evelyn of Godstone and Kingston and his wife, Elizabeth Stevens and that a George Evelyn, a Six Clerk in Chancery, was an uncle. However, a family tree chart of diarist, John Evelyn, from Memoirs, Illustrative of the Life and Writings of John Evelyn... suggests that for George to have been an uncle, Jane would have been a granddaughter of John and Elizabeth. In 1605 Benn purchased Norbiton Hall, in Norbiton to the east of Kingston, from the estate of George Evelyn who had died in 1603. His residence at Norbiton is now commemorated by a green plaque. Richard Taverner, George Evelyn, Anthony Benn, and Mary Chester green plaque. The couple had at least two children; Charles (b.1608) and Amabella (1616‚Äì1698).Benn's daughter is referred to by differing sources as a Amabel, Ammabel, Amabell, Amabela, Amabella, Ammabella and Annabela. Death Sir Anthony Benn memorial in All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames Anthony Benn died in 1618. At his death he possessed a messuage with appurtenances called 'Popes' with of land at Norbiton, all held of the bailiffs of Kingston. This 'Popes' is thought not to have been Norbiton Hall however, for Sir Anthony's son and heir Charles Benn was only eight and daughter, Amabella, two years old at the time and Lady Benn is known to have had a house in Kingston a few years later. Little more is known of Benn's son Charles. As Amabella is referred to by several sources as Anthony Benn's heiress, the inference is that he died young. right left Benn's widow commissioned Benn's memorial effigy and altar tomb, located in the south wall of the chancel of All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames. It contains Benn's recumbent effigy in his lawyer's robe and ruff collar and cuffs; his hands in prayer, once broken off but since restored.

Survivors Benn's widow, Jane, in later life, remarried to Sir Eustace Hart, a widower twenty years her senior, on 23 January 1656. She died in 1673. Benn's daughter, Amabella, or Amabel was baptised in Kingston 3 September 1607. She may have married a Mr Dowse (or Douce) at a young age, though this is unclear. citing: Her more notable marriage was to Anthony Fane, son of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland who fought with the parliamentarians and died from injury sustained during the taking of Farnham Castle in 1643. She remarried Henry Grey, 10th Earl of Kent on 1 August 1644. She bore him two children: Anthony, who inherited the earldom, and Elizabeth, who married Banastre Maynard, 3rd Baron Maynard.

History  The Lowe gardens are one of the many British gifts to a city many of them like and visit regularly. April 26, 1902, Charles Henry Lowe gave these gardens to the city, with a precise goal: \\"... to promote the leisure of the people in old age and fragile health¬ª. The gardens contain more than 60 ancient olive trees, as well as a very old Stone pine, a Grevillea robusta and numerous palms including a Butia capitata. The gardens are almost unchanged from the act of donation, except for the construction of a platform that allows the organisation of open-air concerts in the summer. Charles Henry Lowe also donated to the city the land to build a small theatre, the Victoria Hall, which was also used to host exhibitions, such as one that remained famous in Bordighera of Hermann Nestel. The building has now been converted into a private residence and is located at 40 Via Vittorio Veneto. However, the first gift of Lowe to the city was the Lawn Tennis Club, officially recognized as the oldest in Italy, because it was built in 1878, only a year after the Wimbledon lawns. A commemorative plaque, placed on the older court, honours the arrival of the \\"magic box\\" of Major Walter Clopton Wingfield which included: a net, two rackets and four tennis balls. Charles Henry Lowe was the first president of the club. In the beginnings, tennis was seen as a playful moment waiting for teatime. However, rapidly, the game of tennis became popular and the Tennis Club of Bordighera turned into one of the most competitive of the Riviera, even surpassing the one form Monaco. In addition to the club, the ‚ÄúSirt‚Äù (standing for Societ√† Italiana Racchette Tennis) racket factory was established in 1901. The rackets were manufactured in via Roberto, a stone's throw from the club. This period of glory, however, ended with fascism and the Second World War, when many of the club members died or left permanently. The club was bombed and only 3 courts of the original 15 were left. The Lawn Tennis Club of Bordighera still exists today, it counts 6 courts and is located at 15 Via Antonio Stoppani, a few meters from the Lowe Gardens and the Victoria Hall.

It is a rounded shrub with many thin, flexible branches, narrow leaves and small white flowers. Description Eremophila micrantha is an erect shrub, usually growing to a height of , with a rounded top and many thin, flexible branches which are covered with glands. The branches are glabrous, yellowish when young and become red-brown as they age. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are linear in shape, taper towards the end, have a rough surface and are mostly long and wide. They are also yellow-green in colour, covered with small raised lumps and are sticky due to the presence of resin. The flowers are usually borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on rough, sticky, straight stalks, long. There are 5 yellowish-green, lance-shaped, sticky sepals which are mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. In bud, the flowers are pinkish but open to white, spotted red on the lower middle petal lobe and spotted yellow inside the tube. The outside surface of the tube is densely hairy while the inside is glabrous. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from September to October and the fruits which follow are oval-shaped with a pointed end, long and densely covered with stiff, long hairs. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (micrantha) is derived from the Ancient Greek ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ (mikr√≥s) meaning \\"small\\" or \\"little\\", and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (√°nthos) meaning \\"flower\\", in reference to the small flowers of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila micrantha occurs between Meekatharra and Newman in the Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows in shallow stony soil and near the margins of salt pans, often in mulga shrubland. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Older specimens of this eremophila have very dark trunks, complementing the dark green foliage and tiny white flowers. The small, persistent, white hairy fruits are an added attraction. It can be propagated from seed or with difficulty, by grafting and grows best in a sunny location in well-drained soil. It only needs an occasional watering in long summer droughts and is very tolerant of frosts.

Early life Clemence learnt his trade from 1839 to 1843 in the London offices of C.R. Cockerell. He then worked for Sir Morton Peto and the Lucas Brothers, who were Lowestoft-based building contractors. Architectural practice Clemence practised in his own right from 1854. He designed the Baptist church of St John, Lowestoft in 1853, which was demolished in 1978 and replaced by Levington House, a block of flats. As a child, the composer Benjamin Britten visited with his mother. They lived about a mile away in Kirkley, and his mother was the organist, so it is probable that he also played the organ. All that survives is the organ, which in 1979 was installed at nearby St Andrew, Gorleston. He also designed the Grade II listed Lowestoft Town Hall, which was built on the High Street in 1857. Clemence designed several buildings in Kirkley Cemetery; the Lychgate, South Western and North Eastern Chapels which were all listed in 1998 as Grade II listed buildings. These were built in 1880.

It was founded by Harvey Boulter in 2000. Investments =Electronic privacy= The company has invested in the development of electronic privacy applications, including Seecrypt, a mobile app that encrypts voice calls from smartphones. In 2013 Boulter claimed that Seecrypt is a military encryption technology used by governments and security services in several countries, and that it was impossible for all but the most advanced government agencies to break its encryption. Boulter also claimed that since the company was based in the Cayman Islands, Western security services had no legal right to access any data encrypted by the application. Seecrypt is derived from Cellcrypt, Porton Group‚Äôs military-grade encryption application which has been certified by GCHQ, and which the company claims is widely deployed by the British military in Afghanistan and by law enforcement and intelligence agencies abroad. One of Porton Group's advisers is Sir Joe French, the former UK Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) from 2000, =P2i= Through its investment arm Porton Capital, the group was one of the main suppliers in 2004 of initial funds to P2i, a British nanotechnology development company that produce liquid repellent nano-coating protection for use in military and civilian clothing. As of 2012 Porton Group retained a 20% shareholding in P2i. =Microvisk= Porton Capital was both an initial and subsequent investor in 2013 in Microvisk, the Welsh manufacturers of a home- testing device that allows patients taking anticoagulant medication to check their own blood. Legal dispute with 3M In 2011, Porton Group initiated a lawsuit against the 3M corporation. The dispute centered around the MRSA detection technology BacLite, owned by the company Acolyte, which was in turn comprised the British Ministry of Defence's wholly owned subsidiary Ploughshare Innovations Ltd, and Porton Group. In June 2011 there was a business meeting at the Shangri-La Hotel in Dubai, attended by Scottish businessman Adam Werritty, UK Secretary of State for Defence Dr. Liam Fox, Boulter in his role as CEO of Porton Group, and two other Dubai-based businessmen.Liam Fox, his adviser, and an irregular meeting in Dubai Rupert Neate, The Guardian, Friday 7 October 2011 Werritty had earlier been contacted by a lobbying firm known as Tetra Strategy, whom Boulter had hired at a rate of ¬£10,000 per month, in an attempt to have Fox intervene in a Porton Group legal dispute that indirectly involved the MoD. Tetra are believed to have begun working towards arranging a meeting with Werritty or Fox as early as 25 March 2011. In an email from Lee Petar, Tetra's boss, to Boulter, Werrity is described as the \\"special adviser to the secretary of state for defence Liam Fox.\\"\\"Revealed: how lobbyists were paid to facilitate meeting with Liam Fox\\". Rupert Neate and Patrick Wintour, The Guardian, Monday, 10 October 2011 Werritty's initial meeting with Boulter in April 2011 led to discussions with Fox regarding the sale of Cellcrypt.Fox feels heat as new claim casts doubt on MoD denial Oliver Wright, Whitehall Editor, The Independent, Saturday 8 October 2011. The 45-minute Dubai meeting in June 2011 was primarily about the possible sale of the voice encryption software to the British MoD. Boulter has claimed that the matter of a legal battle between Porton Group and 3M concerning Acolyte, an EU regulatory approved rapid detection technology for MRSA, and a deal worth ¬£41,000,000, was allocated no more than 5‚Äì10 minutes at the end of the meeting. According to The Guardian, details relating to the nature of the visit and the business matters discussed suggest that it was \\"highly irregular\\". The MoD has stated that there were no officials present at the meeting but that one of those present claimed to have received the impression that all of those in attendance had been security cleared. Werritty did not have such clearance.Liam Fox faces further claims over best man Adam Werritty Robin Brant, BBC News, Saturday 8 October, BBC. In late 2011 the High Court in London found in favor of Porton Group, with 3M being forced to pay damages of $1.3 million for breach of its contractual obligations over their failure to accurately test, actively market and successfully seek regulatory approval in the US.

Ali, who was then 62 or 63 years of age, died due to his injuries two days after Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Amr ibn Muljam al-Muradi struck him on his head by a poison- coated sword, on the 21 (or 19) Ramadan 40 AH (28 January 661 CE). He was the third successive caliph, after Umar and Uthman, to be assassinated. Ali became the caliph after the assassination of Uthman in 656. However he faced opposition from some factions including the Levant governor, Muawiyah I. A civil war, called the First Fitna, took place within the early Islamic state which resulted in the overthrow of the Rashidun caliphs and the establishment of the Umayyad dynasty. It began when the caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated in 656 and continued through the four-year reign of Ali. After Ali agreed to arbitration with Muawiyah I following the Battle of Siffin (657), a revolt happened against him by some members of his army, later known as Kharijites (\\"those who leave\\"). They killed some of Ali's supporters, but they were crushed by Ali's forces at the Battle of Nahrawan in July 658. Ibn Muljam met up with two other Kharijites namely al-Burak ibn Abd Allah and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi at Mecca, and concluded that the situation of the Muslims at the time was due to the errors of Ali, Muawiah and Amr ibn As, governor of Egypt. They decided to kill the three in order to resolve the \\"deplorable situation\\" of their time and also avenge their companions killed at Nahrawan. Aiming to kill Ali, Ibn Muljam headed toward Kufa where he fell in love with a woman whose brother and father had died at Nahrawan. She agreed to marry him if only he could kill Ali. Consequently, Ali was stabbed by Ibn Muljam at the Great Mosque of Kufa. After Ali's death, Ibn Muljam was executed in retaliation by Hasan ibn Ali.  Background  Events leading to Ali's assassination trace back to the death of Muhammad, prophet of Islam, where the community of Muslims disputed over his succession as the leader of Ummah. The assembly at the Saqifat Bani Saida gave allegiance to Abu Bakr as the caliph. While Sunni muslims believed that Muhammad had not selected a successor, Shia Muslims believed that Ali was appointed as Muhammad's successor by God referring to the event of Ghadir Khumm. Abu Bakr was succeeded by Umar, who was murdered in 644. After Umar's death, Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and Uthman were contenders for the post. Uthman was elected as caliph by an election council. Ali became the caliph after the assassination of Uthman in 656. Ali's caliphate was coincident with First Fitna. Though Ali was elected as the fourth Rashidun (the \\"rightly guided\\") caliph five days after Uthman's death, he faced opposition during his rule. On one hand, A'isha, Talhah and Al-Zubayr revolted against him in Mecca and on the other hand Muawiyah I, the Umayyad governor of Levant, refused to pledge allegiance to him as the new caliph. Therefore, a civil war about succession to the office of the caliphate took place. Ali's opponents asked the killers of Uthman should be punished. Ali, first emerged victorious at the Battle of Camel in 656, against an army primarily led by Muhammad's wife Aisha and other sahaba. Then, Ali also fought the Battle of Siffin in 657 against Muawiyah. The battle ended in a stalemate with Ali entering into arbitration with Muawiyah. A group of Ali's army, later known as Kharijites or Khawarij (\\"those who leave\\"), opposed against arbitration after the battle of Siffin, when he accepted arbitration with Mu'awiya. They opposed to human judgement in the matter of religion and used \\"Judgment belongs to God alone,\\" as their slogan. In 658 they violated their oath of allegiance, revolted and openly threatened to kill any Muslim who would not join them. Ali defeated them at the Battle of Nahrawan. The killing of the Kharijites was \\"the most problematic event\\" during Ali's caliphate, because they had been among his most vigorous allies in the war against Muawiah. Ibn Muljam along with two other men, namely al- Burak ibn Abd Allah and Amr ibn Bakr al-Tamimi, all considered as belonging to Kinda, met at Mecca and had a long discussion after the pilgrimage ceremony. They concluded that the situation of Muslims at the time was due to Ali, Mu øawiya and Amr ibn al-As, \\"whom they regarded as being in error\\", and swore to kill them to also \\"avenge their companion's massacred at al-Nahrawan.\\" They arranged the date of assassination and each of them chose his victim. = Ali's prediction of his fate = Two types of traditions exist regarding Ali's awareness of his fate long before the assassination. This foreknowledge was through his own \\"premonition of it\\" or by Muhammad. Based on numerous traditions, Ali's beard staining with \\"blood flowing from his head\\" had been revealed by Muhammad or Ali. Another set of traditions by Muhammad says that \\"the most evil man among the ancients was he who had killed the camel of the prophet Salih and among his contemporaries, he who would kill Ali.\\" The night of the assassination, Ali said that his fate was about to come true, and when he left home in the morning, \\"geese followed him, cackling\\" weeping for his funeral, as he said later.  Assassination  Ali was leading Fajr prayers at the Great Mosque of Kufa in Iraq when he was assassinated. Ali was assassinated by Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Amr ibn Muljam al-Muradi, a Kharijite from Egypt. Ibn Muljam was of Himyar paternally, but was counted among the Murad due to his maternal kinship, and allied with the Bani Jabala of Kindah. He had entered Kufa with the aim of killing Ali to avenge the Kharijite leaders at Al-Nahrawan. In Kufa, he encountered a group of people from Taym al-Ribab tribe who were mourning ten of their tribemates killed at Nahrawan by Ali's army. Among them was a woman named Quttaam. According to cleric Ali al- Sallabi, on seeing Quttaam, he \\"lost his senses\\" and \\"forgot the assignment\\" for which he was roaming, and proposed to her. Quttaam said that she would marry him if he could \\"heal\\" her by giving her three thousand dinars, a chanteuse, a male slave and the death of Ali. Quttaam wanted revenge too as her father and brother had been killed by Ali's forces at Al-Nahrawan. Ibn Muljam persuaded a man called Shubayb to assist him in killing Ali. Besides Shablb ibn Bujra, Wardan ibn al-Mujalid also were Ibn Muljam's accomplice. The conspirators stationed themselves opposite the door from which Ali would enter the Mosque. On Friday, 19 (or 17) Ramadan, Ali entered Kufa mosque to perform the morning prayer. Ibn Muljam wounded Ali on the \\"crown of his head\\" by a poisoned sword after Ali had recited verses from the Sura al-Anbiya as part of the worship, or when he was entering the mosque. Shablb's sword did not hit Ali and instead \\"hit the wooden frame of the door or the arch.\\" He fled and was caught near the gates of Kinda by 'Uwaymir', but could finally escape through the crowd. Wardan ran away to his home and was killed there by a relative, \\"'Abd Allah b. Najaba b. Ubayd, after confessing his involvement.\\" Ibn Muljam was caught by the Hashimite al-Mughlra ibn Nawfal ibn al-Harith. Ali ordered that if he died from the wound, Ibn Muljam had to be executed in retaliation.* Ali died two days later on 21 Ramadan 40/30 January 661 (or 19 Ramadan 40/28 January 661) at the age of 62 or 63, and Ibn Muljam was killed in retaliation (Qisas) by Hasan ibn Ali, in accordance with Ali's instruction. = Role of Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays = Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays was the chief of Kindah tribe in Kufa. According to Wilferd Madelung, in the final years of Ali's reign he had tendency towards Muawiah and received letter including offers of money from him to show reluctance about Ali's campaign against Muawiah. Some sources have accused al-Ash'ath of being informed of the plot of the assassination of Ali. According to al-Yaqubi, Ibn Muljam was hosted by al- Ash'ath for a month when Ibn Muljam had been preparing his sword. Another report by Ibn Sa'd says that al-Ash'ath stayed the night of the killing at mosque counseling Ibn Muljam and that al-Ash'ath signaled the time of attempting the assassination by saying \\"the morning has smiled.\\" The majority of the sources narrates an ambiguous phrase from Al-Ash'ath:\\"the dawn has risen for thee\\" and those who has Shia tendency give it as a clear encouragement to Ibn Muljam: \\"Deliverance, deliverance! The dawn has risen for thee.\\" After assassination, Hujr ibn 'Adi accused him for Ali's murder. There is even a report which says he warned Ali about Ibn Muljam. According to Laura Veccia Vaglieri, the sources narrate different reports which vary from outright accusation to a suspicion of complicity and even to an act of loyalty. However Al-Sallabi believes that these accusations against al-Ash'ath seem baseless as he was a loyalist and was against Kharijites from the time they first appeared and fought them at Nahrawan. He was also the first one to fight against the people of Syria in the battle for the water. Moreover, he believes there exists no narration from the family of Ali ibn Abi Talib supporting these accusations against al-Ash'ath, neither his family did not discuss it with any member of al-Ash'ath's family. After Ali was injured by Ibn Muljam, al-Ash øath sent his son to determine Ali's condition, his words suggesting that he knew Ali would not survive.  Burial  Ali's body was washed by his sons, Hasan, Husayn, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah and one of his nephew, Abdullah ibn Ja'far. Then he was secretly buried by them and 'Ubaydullah ibn Al-Abbas, since it was feared that his body would be \\"exhumed and profaned\\". Some sources claim Ali was buried at the Imam Ali Mosque at Najaf in present-day Iraq, while others, usually Afghans, say he was buried at the Rawze-e-Sharif in the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Ali's death is commemorated by Shia Muslims every year.  Aftermath  According to Wilferd Madelung, a small minority of people were convinced that \\"he was the best of Muslims after the Prophet and the only one entitled to rule them,\\" and after Ali's death people were divided regarding their view toward him. \\"Distrust of, and opposition to, Mu'awiya and his Syrian cohorts\\" was what united the majority. Ali's admirers then turned into majority due to \\"highhandedness, misrule and repression\\" that composed the rule of the Umayyads. After Ali's death, the Shias of Iraq declared Ali's eldest son Hasan the successor to Ali, thus proclaiming him as their new caliph. However, Hasan was not interested in becoming caliph, and to prevent further bloodshed, he signed the Hasan‚ÄìMuawiya treaty and abdicated in favor of Muawiyah, who became the first caliph of the Umayyad caliphate. Muawiyah died in Damascus at the age of seventy-five in 680, and was succeeded by Yazid I in 61 AH (680 CE) but Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali refused to accept Yazid's leadership. After being invited by the Kufans of Iraq in the same year, Husayn started his march to Iraq. However, during their stay at Karbala, his family was massacred by Yazid at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram (10 October) and his death is commemorated by Shia, while remembered by nearly all Muslims every year during Muharram paying tribute to the grandson of Muhammad's grandson and family's brutal assassination.  In arts  The incident had been subjects of paintings by Yousef Abdinejad, Farhad Sadeghi, and Masnsoureh Hossein, and a stageplay by Bahram Beyzai. Abdinejad's work is described as showing a \\"duality\\" by using colors. Colors of blue spectra, which is \\"proportional\\" to turquoise color used for painting Ali, light beams arising from Imam Ali's body and the angles are among the elements used by the painter to inspire a sort of spirituality. On the other hand, Ibn Muljam, the assassin, is painted in brown surrounded by the blue colors and some evil creatures are seen on his feet. There's a flame arising from the body of Ibn Muljam which the painter has used to demonstrate the destiny of the assassin‚Äîi.e., hell fire. The imprint of Mohr is seen on the forehead of the assassin.

In July he stopped Tommy Noble in the fifth round, and after losing to Cuthbert in September made a second successful title defence in November, with a points win over Hindley to win the Lonsdale Belt outright. He finished the year with wins over Jack \\"Kid Froggy\\" Hyams and Young Johnny Brown. Curley made a third defence of the title in January 1927, losing a points decision to Cuthbert. He won seven of nine fights in the remainder of the year, and travelled to Australia in 1928, where he won all four of his fights, including a points win over Australian champion Tommy Barber. Back in England, he beat Auguste Gyde on points in July, but by the end of the year his fortunes dipped. From 1929 until his retirement on medical advice in 1931 he won only six of 34 fights. During this period he also refereed bouts. He returned in 1937 for one fight, a defeat at the hands of Al Church.

Biography George Parbury was born 24 January 1807, and baptised on 18 February at St. Leonard's, Shoreditch. He was the second child and eldest son of Hannah Warne and Charles Parbury, the ‚Äúhead of the firm of Parbury, Allen, and Co., the eminent booksellers connected with India‚Äù.The Gentleman's Magazine, January‚ÄìJune, 1835, p105 George was apprenticed to his father in March 1823. In December 1826 he was granted permission to travel to India and reside in Bengal; the surety of ¬£500 was provided by ‚ÄúCharles Parbury and William H Allen, booksellers of Leadenhall Street‚Äù. George arrived in Calcutta on the steamship Enterprise in 1828. Parbury had been sent by his father to work with William Thacker's bookselling firm in Calcutta. Thacker (1791‚Äì1872) had received a licence from the East India Company, allowing him to reside at Fort William ‚Äúto dispose of Messrs. Black Parbury and Co.‚Äôs consignment‚Äù, presumably shipped from England, thus marking the beginning of Thacker's company in Calcutta,The History of Thacker Spink and Co. in Bengal, Past & Present: Journal of the Calcutta Historical Society, vol. XLI, January‚ÄìJune, 1931 and was later made a partner of W. Thacker and Co., St. Andrew's Library, Calcutta. There were also family connections between Thacker and Parbury: William Thacker's third marriage, at St Pancras church on 29 December 1841, was to Helen Parbury, George's youngest sister. Soon after he arrived in Calcutta George Parbury became a freemason: in August 1830 he was initiated in the Aurora Lodge of Candour and Cordiality No. 816, Calcutta.From records kept at Freemasons Hall, London Later, after his return to England in 1832, Parbury joined Moira Lodge No. 109 (now No. 92) in London, and became Master of the Lodge in 1838. In England George met, or was re-acquainted with, 22 year old Mary Ann Joanna Ellis of Hertford, and married her in St Andrew's church there on 21 May 1833. In April 1834 their first child, George Edward Ellis, was born; the infant survived only four months, and was buried in the same church. Parbury gained Freedom of the City of London on 3 September 1835, followed three months later by Livery status in the Merchant Taylors‚Äô Company. George and Mary's second child, also George, was born in July 1836, and a third (Emily) was born the following year. Eighteen months later, in May 1839, he sailed from Portsmouth on the Owen Glendower, arriving in Calcutta on 20 August. George remained there for some eight months, and then returned to England, this time overland to Bombay and then by ship. Early on 13 August 1840 Parbury departed by river from Calcutta on a steam vessel to Allahabad, which was as far as it could go at the time. He then travelled overland, via Agra, Delhi, Bahr and Simla, eventually reaching Bombay at the end of November, 109 days after setting out. On the first of December he was on the steamer Cleopatra, en route to Aden and Suez. After travelling overland and reaching Cairo on 21 December, he sailed from Alexandria on ‚Äúthe splendid steamer, Great Liverpool‚Äù, which set off on the 24th, travelling via Malta, Gibraltar, Falmouth and the Isle of Wight quarantine station. Parbury set foot on land on 16 January 1841, six and a half weeks after leaving Bombay, and just over 5 months from Calcutta. Soon afterwards Parbury published a description of his travels. The first edition, published anonymously, was dated London, 20 June 1841. A year later, a second editionHand Book for India and Egypt, comprising the narrative of a journey from Calcutta to England by way of the river Ganges, the north west of Hindostan, the Himalayas, the rivers Sutledge and Indus, Bombay and Egypt; and Hints for the guidance of passengers by that and other overland routes to the three presidencies of India. Both were published by William H. Allen & Co. was published under the name of George Parbury, Esq., MRAS.Member of the Royal Asiatic Society Parbury's book ‚Äì a copy of which he had lodged in the Royal Asiatic Society library ‚Äì was soon given a warm review in The Asiatic JournalThe Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register, Vol. 38 New Series, May‚ÄìAugust 1842, p128 J. H. Stocqueler had also written a Handbook of India based on his various experiences as a traveller and his residence in India for some twenty years. When he finally left India he sailed in distinguished company from Calcutta to Suez on the Hindostan, and thence overland to take a ship from Alexandria; his account appeared from the same publisher in 1844.JH Stocqueler, The Hand-Book of India, a Guide to the Stranger and the Traveller, and a Companion to the Resident (London, 1844). Parbury's colleagues, W Thacker and Co., chose to attack Stocqueler's work in 1845, but without informing him first. They accused Stocqueler of not having acknowledged his \\"obligation to Mr Parbury‚Äôs 'Hand Book of India and Egypt' \\" when presenting his own book. Stocqueler's rejoinder was published as a letterRepublished in The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce 14 May 1845 to The Madras Athenaeum, stating in part: > Has it ever occurred to him that in sending people to buy his personal > narrative, facetiously dubbed a \\"Hand Book of India and Egypt,\\" I should be > guilty of leading people to purchase a volume which treats of the merest > fraction of India in the most superficial style, and was found so > ridiculously insufficient as a guide to Overland Travellers that none of the > passengers by the Hindostan in 1843 (I speak of them as I was one of them, > though doubtless others have been in the same predicament) could gather from > its pages the slightest information that was of any use to them. I declare > most solemnly that my Hand Book was solely undertaken and put forth because > Mr Parbury's was so wretchedly imperfect, and for no other reason. Soon after the birth of his fourth and last child by Mary (Edward Fraser, in March 1843) George sailed again to India. He returned from Calcutta on the recently launched steamship Bentinck, departing in March 1844. In October of the following year, Mary died of consumption at Mansfield House, 37 Russell Square, aged 34. In 1849 Parbury was married again, this time to Lucy Wilson Key, the fourth child of John Key, later Sir John Key, first baronet, Lord Mayor of London and Master of the Stationers' Company. Lucy, who was 15 years Parbury's junior and only 10 years older than his first wife, provided George with five more children: three sons and two daughters, born variously in Germany, Calcutta and England. One of his grandchildren was Florence Tyzack Parbury. Parbury turned his attention to Merchant Taylors again. In July 1855 he was appointed a Warden and a member of the Court of Assistants, involving him more in the management of the guild. He was appointed Master of Merchant Taylors in 1866 and, in that capacity, he hosted the following year's annual banquet in Merchant Taylors‚Äô Hall. Well over a hundred of the great and the good attended, including 20 MPs, the Presidents of learned institutions, members of the clergy, senior military figures and eminent members of the aristocracy, including the Marquis of Salisbury, the Earl of Sandwich and Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. His Excellency the United States Minister (Charles Francis Adams, Sr., son of President John Quincy Adams) was a prominent guest, whose health was toasted, along with others, at the end of the evening. The principal speaker was the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Benjamin Disraeli). Parbury was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets on 4 September 1858.,The London Gazette, 5 October 1858, p4365 and was a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Surrey and Middlesex.The London Gazette, 8 July 1881, p3422 He died on 27 January 1881 at the family home: Thornbury House, Caterham in Surrey, and was buried in the family vault at Kensal Green Cemetery.

When they are bound to surface antigen on target cell (e.g. bacterial or viral infected cell), the classical complement pathway is triggered by bonding protein C1q to these antibodies, resulting in formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) and target cell lysis. Complement system is efficiently activated by human IgG1, IgG3 and IgM antibodies, weakly by IgG2 antibodies and it is not activated by IgG4 antibodies. It is one mechanism of action by which therapeutic antibodiesThe Role of Complement in the Mechanism of Action of Rituximab for B-Cell Lymphoma: Implications for Therapy. Zhou 2008 or antibody fragmentsComplement dependent cytotoxicity activity of therapeutic antibody fragments is acquired by immunogenic glycan coupling. can achieve an antitumor effect.  Use of CDC assays  = Therapeutic antibodies = Development of antitumor therapeutic antibodies involves in vitro analysis of their effector functions including ability to trigger CDC to kill target cells. Classical approach is to incubate antibodies with target cells and source of complement (serum). Then cell death is determined with several approaches: * Radioactive method: target cells are labeled with 51Cr before CDC assay, chromium is released during cell lysis and amount of radioactivity is measured. * Measuring of the metabolic activity of live cells (live cells staining): after incubation of target cells with antibodies and complement, plasma membrane-permeable dye is added (e.g. calcein-AM or resazurin). Live cells metabolise it into impermeable fluorescent product that can be detected by flow cytometry. This product can‚Äôt be formed in metabolically inactive dead cells. * Measuring of the activity of released intracellular enzymes: dead cells release enzyme (e.g. LDH or GAPDH) and addition of its substrate leads to color change, that is usually quantified as change of absorbance or luminiscence. * Dead cells staining: a (fluorescent) dye gets inside the dead cells through their damaged plasma membrane. For instance propidium iodide binds to DNA of dead cells and fluorescent signal is measured by flow cytometry. = HLA typing and crossmatch test = CDC assays are used to find a suitable donor for organ or bone marrow transplantation, namely donor with matching phenotype of histocompatibility system HLA. At first, HLA typing is done for patient and donor to determine their HLA phenotypes. When potentially suitable couple is found, crossmatch test is done to exclude that patient produces donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, which could cause graft rejection. CDC form of HLA typing (other words serologic typing) uses batch of anti-HLA antibodies from characterised allogeneic antisera or monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies are incubated one by one with patient‚Äòs or donor‚Äòs lymphocytes and source of complement. Amount of dead cells (and thus positive result) is measured by dead or live cells staining. Nowadays CDC typing is being replaced by molecular typing, which can identify nucleotide sequences of HLA molecules via PCR. CDC assay is usually used for performing crossmatch test. The basic version involves incubation of patient‚Äôs serum with donor‚Äôs lymphocytes and second incubation after adding rabbit complement. Presence of dead cell (positive test) means that donor isn‚Äòt suitable for this particular patient. There are modifications available to increase test sensitivity including extension of minimal incubation time, adding antihuman globulin (AHG), removing unbound antibodies before adding complement, separation of T cell and B cell subset. Besides CDC crossmatch there is flow-cytometric crossmatch available, that is more sensitive and can detect even complement non-activating antibodies.

It has rough, black bark on the trunk, smooth grey to white bark on the branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to conical fruit.flower budsfruitillustration from A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus (Joseph Maiden) Description Eucalyptus kondininensis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and usually forms a lignotuber although some specimens lack a lignotuber and are mallets. The bark on at least half of the trunk is rough, hard, black and flaky, the bark above smooth, grey and white. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds more or less sessile. Flowering occurs between December and July and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. The seeds are glossy, reddish brown, flattened oval and long. Taxonomy Eucalyptus kondininensis was first formally described by Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in 1925 in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet is in reference to town of Kondinin, the area in which tree is found. The tree belongs in subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Dumaria to a large sub-group, the series Rufispermae, composed of 37 described species and subspecies including E. striaticalyx, E. gypsophila and E. repullulans. Distribution and ecology Kondinin blackbutt is found on rocky rises, on salt flats and around salt lakes in inland areas of the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it grows in loamy-sandy-clay soils over laterite. It has a scattered distribution from around Pingelly in the west to Ravensthorpe in the east and from Lake King in the north to Nyabing in the south. Found in open woodland areas where it occurs as part of the overstorey along with Eucalyptus longicornis, E. urna, E. sargentii and E. salmonophloia. Associated species found in the understorey include Melaleuca lateriflora, M. acuminata, M. thyoides, Rhagodia drummondii, Atriplex paludosa, Atriplex vesicaria, Rhagodia preissii, Templetonia sulcata, Acacia erinacea and Disphyma crassifolium.

He first served as Duterte's Presidential Spokesperson from 2017 to 2018 and was reappointed in April 2020. He previously served as the Party-list Representative of KABAYAN from 2016 to 2017. Roque taught constitutional law and public international law for 15 years at the University of the Philippines College of Law. Among the notable cases he handled are the Maguindanao massacre and Jennifer Laude cases. He was requested by President Rodrigo Duterte to be his presidential spokesperson, and on October 27, 2017, Roque was officially appointed, replacing Ernesto Abella. On November 22, 2017, he was designated presidential adviser for human rights concurrent with being the presidential spokesperson. Roque is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Asian Society of International Law (AsianSIL) and was president of AsianSIL from 2018-2019. Education Roque received his Bachelor of Arts (economics and political science) from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (1986), Bachelor of Laws from University of the Philippines (1990) and Master of Laws with merits from the London School of Economics (1996). Career = Lawyer = Through the advocacy group Center for International Law (Centerlaw), of which he was one of the founders, Roque and his team represented victims of the 2009 Ampatuan massacre;  the Malaya Lolas, victims of systematic rape and abuse by the Japanese Imperial Army; the family of the killed transgender Jennifer Laude; and the family of the murdered environmental advocate and media man Gerry Ortega of Palawan. Roque has argued before the Supreme Court on several occasions. On the Supreme Court website, the retired Supreme Court Justice Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura identifies him \\"as among those who have impressed him when they had argued before the Supreme Court\\". Among the cases that he argued before the high court were assailing Presidential Proclamation 1017 and General Order No. 5, placing the country under a State of Emergency partially unconstitutional for infringing on the constitutionally protected rights of free speech, peaceful assembly and freedom of the press. He is also among the five counsels allowed to argue specific issues raised against the Cybercrime Law. On another occasion, he represented the Integrated Bar of the Philippines in arguing that local government officials cannot deny applications for rally permits except on grounds that the conduct of the same will result in a clear and present danger to the state. He also helped secure for Boracay Foundation a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO) to stop the reclamation of 42 hectares of land in Caticlan due to the absence of studies and guarantees that it would not damage Boracay Island. Roque won the first ever granted petition for the writ of Amparo in favor of a journalist,  as well as another petition for Amparo - the second application for writ of Amparo where the Court of Appeals issued protective orders. He mentored and coached some of the UP College of Law moot teams that went on to win in various competitions, including the 2015 Oxford Price Moot Court Competition in Oxford, UK, where the team beat 91 others. He also mentored the team that won prizes in the Red Cross International Humanitarian Law Moot Competition held in Hong Kong on March 18, 2015, and the team that won the championship on March 11‚Äì12, 2005. In March 2012, Team Philippines made it to the semi-finals of the 2012 Jessup International Law Moot Court competition in Washington DC. = Congressman = After becoming a congressman, Roque resigned as a member of the Center for International Law (Centerlaw). He was the principal author of the Universal Health Coverage Bill, which was passed on third and final reading by the House of Representatives on September 6, 2017. Roque defended the bill during the plenary debates.  Roque was also one of three representatives who endorsed the impeachment case against the former Comelec chairman, Andres Bautista. = Presidential spokesperson = Roque assumed the role of President Duterte's presidential spokesperson on November 6, 2017. According to Duterte, \\"To get the message clear, sabi ko, Harry will fit the... kasi medyo malikot ang bunganga namin.\\" This translates to \\"To get the message clear, I said, Harry will fit the... because we both have slightly naughty mouths.\\" In August 2018, in defense of Duterte's controversial suggestion that the high rates of rape in Davao was caused by there being many attractive women there, Roque defended the president's comments, saying that \\"it's more liberal in the South\\". Months after resigning from his post to run in the 2019 midterm elections, Roque once again returned to his role as Duterte's presidential spokesperson, replacing Salvador Panelo, who also replaced him in 2018.In concurrent capacity as Presidential Spokesperson, Roque is also the Spokesperson for the IATF. On July 1, Roque was widely criticized for allegedly violating quarantine rules by visiting the Ocean Adventure marine theme park in Subic Bay Freeport Zone. He explained that his trip was not for leisure, as his main purpose of travel was to check on his family's business in Bataan: \\"I asked if they [Ocean Adventure] were open. I said, 'Why not?' because they were near where I was going.\\" He also denied violating social distancing, saying: \\"I was only beside dolphins\\". The photos of Roque's visit were uploaded on Facebook by Ocean Adventure but were taken down shortly. Roque has since apologized, but denied violating quarantine protocols: \\"Even though I did not violate any regulation, I recognize that some were offended by the photos. To those who were offended, my apologies. I am only human. My work has no weekends. So if a break is needed, you do it whenever possible.\\"  Personal life  Roque is a Protestant. He is married, with two children.

Every ≈öuddhƒÅvƒÅsa deva is therefore a protector of Buddhism. (Brahma Sahampati, who appealed to the newly enlightened Buddha to teach, was an Anagami from a previous BuddhaSusan Elbaum Jootla \\"Teacher of the Devas\\": The Wheel Publication No. 414/416 (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1997) article link at Access to Insight). Because a ≈öuddhƒÅvƒÅsa deva will never be reborn outside the ≈öuddhƒÅvƒÅsa worlds, no Bodhisattva is ever born in these worlds, as a Bodhisattva must ultimately be reborn as a human being. Since these devas rise from lower planes only due to the teaching of a Buddha, they can remain empty for very long periods if no Buddha arises. However, unlike the lower worlds, the ≈öuddhƒÅvƒÅsa worlds are never destroyed by natural catastrophe. The ≈öuddhƒÅvƒÅsa devas predict the coming of a Buddha and, taking the guise of Brahmins, reveal to human beings the signs by which a Buddha can be recognized. They also ensure that a Bodhisattva in his last life will see the four signs that will lead to his renunciation.

He was raised by his Norwegian mother, who took him on annual trips to Norway, where she told him the stories of trolls and witches present in the dark Scandinavian fables. Dahl was influenced by the stories, and returned to many of the themes in his children's books. His mother also nurtured a passion in the young Dahl for reading and literature. During the Second World War Dahl was a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the subsequent injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attach√©, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C. S. Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use in an article in The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988. Dahl's first script was for a stage work, The Honeys, which appeared on Broadway in 1955. He followed this with a television script, \\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\", for the Alfred Hitchcock Presents series. He also co-wrote screenplays for film, including for You Only Live Twice (1967) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). In 1982 Dahl published the first of three editions of poems‚Äîall aimed at children. The following year he edited a book of ghost stories. He also wrote several works of non-fiction, including three autobiographies, a cookery book, a safety leaflet for the British railways and a book on measles, which was about the death of his daughter Olivia from measles encephalitis. As at 2019, Dahl's works have been translated into 63 languages and have sold more than 200 million books worldwide. His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990. In 2008 The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of \\"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\\". He has been referred to by The Independent as \\"one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century\\". On his death in 1990, Howard considered him \\"one of the most widely read and influential writers of our generation\\".

At one time it was a rival to \\"Oberlin, Kenyon or Denison\\". The building also served the home of Hayesville High School (1886 - 1929). History At one time this academy/college had an enrollment of about 600 students who came from 13 states. Founded 1843 as one of the first institutions of higher education in north central Ohio, it was chartered by Ohio Legislature March 4, 1845. Originally Baptist, by 1849 it became Presbyterian-affiliated. Its cornerstone was laid July 4, 1845. Future U. S. President Rutherford B. Hayes was said to have attended the dedication, music for which was provided by the Jeromesville, Ohio band. It was built by Edwin Hubbard and its design is credited to Ashland native Ozias S. Kinney (1811‚Äì1869), who later was an architect in Chicago. =Conversion to private academy= Longtime leader at the Vermillion Institute was Professor Saunders Diefendorf, a Yale-educated Presbyterian minister, who was the principal in 1851. Enrollment declined as students and faculty left to fight in the American Civil War and the institute went into a long slow decline. Diefendorf left Hayesville in 1866 after the Vermillion Institute was not accepted as the site for the new Presbyterian college, which instead went to Wooster. After its rejection as the site of a new Church of God college, located later at Findlay, Ohio, the institute property was sold back to Hayesville and operated as a private academy. Diefendorf returned to head this reorganized school, which was a preparatory academy to the College of Wooster. It later became the Hayesville High School. The 1929 opening of new combined elementary and high school at the opposite end of the village meant the end of public use of the Vermillion Institute. It was partially used for social organizations but was largely abandoned. A tall stone fountain with memorial plaques once stood in front of the building, until its removal in the 1950s to nearby Kendig Park. Structure This 35 by 50 ft. three-story brick building with gable roof and two-stage tower with pinnacles is the surviving main building of the Vermillion Institute. The ground floor was an assembly space used for daily chapel services. The second floor had classrooms and a library and meeting rooms for literary societies were on the third floor. During its operation, two-story flanking frame buildings served as men's and women's dormitories, but these no longer stand. The thick brick walls with flat-arched lintels over its numerous windows enabled the building to stand through years of neglect. Rehabilitation In 2011 the property was purchased by preservation consultant Steven McQuillin and an extensive rehabilitation was begun, with assistance from the Ohio Preservation Tax Credit. The two-foot-thick brick walls of the building were repointed and strengthened by filling the chimney cavities with reinforced concrete and pouring a concrete wall inside the rubble sandstone base. Masonry walls were braced and repointed and the wood structure removed. Deteriorated hewn wood trusses were replaced with new wood trusses. New structure re- creates floors at their original levels. The long-missing tower was reconstructed and contains a two-level office space featuring cherry woodwork and stained glass windows, plus winding staircase leading to the main two- story cherry staircase. The ground floor is a meeting space. The second floor has a great room space, combining kitchen and living areas. the northeast corner has a dining room with table built from old timbers taken from the building and whose walls will have scenic murals. The third floor has a library on the east side with books on preservation and historic atlases and two rooms connected by a large bathroom on the west side.

Description Eucalyptus laevis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of or a tree to , and it forms a lignotuber. It has thin, rough, fibrous or flaky bark on at least part of the trunk, sometimes also the larger branches, smooth bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and leaves that are bluish grey, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval long and about wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or below it. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus laevis was first formally described in 2001 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected near Norseman and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (laevis) is variant of a Latin word meaning 'smooth' or 'free from unevenness', referring to the flower buds.

Myers ran a business of manufacturing and selling passenger airship balloons and high altitude weather balloons with her husband, Carl Myers. The couple obtained several patents on aerial navigation devices and promoted these through exhibition demonstrations at county fairs and town shows. They built their balloons and related equipment at their \\"balloon farm\\" in Frankfort, New York. Myers By the time Myers retired from flying passengers in 1891, she had made hundreds of ascents and carried more than 100,000 passengers up in her balloons. She continued conducting test flights after her retirement.  Early life  Myers was born Mary Breed Hawley in August 1849 in Breed's Hill in Boston. She was descended from family lines with the surnames of Breed (from the state of Massachusetts) and Hawley (from the state of Connecticut). alt=Photograph of a bearded man wearing a suit, looking to his right. She married Carl Edgar Myers on November 8, 1871, in Hornellsville, New York. They started their married life in Mohawk, New York. They had one child, a daughter by the name of Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Aerial. Myers' husband was a scientist and an aeronautical engineer. He was born in 1842 at Fort Herkimer, New York. He was at one time or another a banker, carpenter, chemist, electrician, mechanic, photographer, plumber, printer, and writer. At about the age of 40, Carl devoted his full attention to aeronautical engineering and designing passenger balloon airships.  Mid life and career  Myers' husband had schooling from a scientist and developed an interest in what was known at the time as \\"aerial navigation\\": piloted flight by a person in a large balloon with a gondola basket hanging underneath. Myers and her husband invented new or improved systems for producing lighter-than-air gases and constructed hydrogen balloons that were controllable \\"airships\\". Their airships included an a√´rial velocipede sky- cycle, which Myers flew often, and gas weather balloons for the U.S. government. Myers and her husband patented a fabric for holding hydrogen gas in a large outdoor balloon, and from this they became designers of floating passenger balloons. At first they hired experienced aeronaut test pilots to fly their new designs of balloon assemblies. When they couldn't get a test pilot to fly a new design, they did the flying themselves. Myers was also an assistant lab technician and the business secretary-bookkeeper. = Aeronaut = alt=A poster with large, bold text announcing a \\"balloon ascension\\" featuring \\"the fascinating 'Queen of the Air' Carlotta\\". Myers developed an interest in wanting to become a test pilot aeronaut herself after watching her husband fly successfully. She decided not to use her plain real name of \\"Mary\\" for her flying performances and instead took on the more romantic, exotic stage name of \\"Carlotta.\\" It is uncertain who picked the derivative of her husband's name, but it seems that her husband Carl had some influence. She ultimately became known professionally as \\"Carlotta, the Lady Aeronaut,\\" \\"Carlotta Myers-Lady Aeronaut,\\" and \\"Carlotta / Mrs. Carl Myers.\\" Myers helped develop with her husband lighter-than-air balloons that used lower cost natural gas, which at the time was considered America's modern fuel. The first solo flight that Myers completed was from Little Falls, New York, on July 4, 1880.Little Falls Journal, (front page) July 13, 1880 It was done in sight of 15,000 spectators. At about five o'clock in the afternoon, she stepped into the balloon's gondola basket. She wore a blue flannel suit and a sailor's hat, all of which gave her a boyish appearance. Her lift off was synced with a carrier pigeon that was thrown out of the balloon when the ground crew released the gondola basket. The pigeon carried a message to her friends and neighbors in Mohawk, New York to inform them that her balloon ascent had just started. She rode for about a half-hour some 20 miles to the town of Stratford, New York, landing safely in a farmer's field. After she packed up her balloon, the farmer's son gave her a ride back to Little Falls, and she then took a train back to Mohawk. Myers was subsequently hired to take tourists on balloon rides in Saratoga Springs, New York and throughout upstate New York. Myers controlled flight direction by the use of barometer and altitude readings. She used recordings of previous flights to know at which altitude she would encounter certain air currents. She then used these particular air currents for navigation. Myers would go higher or lower by operating valves that controlled the hydrogen gas and by adjusting sandbag weights. She then navigated to the desired air current which would take her to her destination. Her balloon airship was also steerable by the shifting of her weight and by fin rudder apparatuses exposed to the air currents. Not all of her flights were safely accomplished. The demonstration event at the Chenango county fairgrounds at Norwich, New York, on September 9, 1880, went smoothly at first: Myers' balloon, named \\"Aerial\\", ascended quickly upon liftoff. When it had obtained several thousand feet in altitude, however, she encountered rain. The accumulation of water in her open gondola caused extra weight and her balloon started dropping fast. She threw her ballast sandbags overboard, but despite this the balloon gondola began dragging on the treetops and eventually landed on the top of a basswood tree ‚Äì eighty feet off the ground. After being stuck there for over an hour in pouring rain, Myers was rescued by a group of hunters who obtained a long ladder from a nearby farmer. In another incident, Myers ‚Äì who had already flown 179 times ‚Äì ascended in a balloon called the \\"Flying Cloud\\" on July 2, 1883. During an earlier demonstration on the ground, the balloon had been damaged by large crowds pressing too close, and now it broke open at an altitude of two miles. Myers saved herself by floating on the balloon fragments as a quick makeshift parachute that carried her on a twelve-mile slated course that slowly dropped to the ground. = Balloon farm and business = alt=A photo of a large, three-story house with many half-inflated balloons in the front yard. In 1889 Myers and her husband set up a successful business of making and selling hydrogen balloons from their five-acre farm in Frankfort, New York. The property came with a three- story Victorian style house with 30 rooms. The house had been previously constructed and owned by a businessman associated with the Diamond Match Company, with the mansion being built in 1878. After Myers' husband had purchased the property, he converted a portion of the house into shop facilities for manufacturing lighter-than-air passenger balloons. The house shop facilities had a sewing room to make balloon fabric, a chemical lab for the varnishes needed to seal the fabric, basement equipment for making lighter-than-air hydrogen gas, a printing press for advertising, a carpentry shop for the gondola baskets, and a machine shop for metal parts. Their half- inflated balloons on the property where the fabric was being processed looked like giant mushrooms and gave the impression that they were growing balloons on their farm as an unusual agricultural crop, hence the name \\"balloon farm.\\" Myers and her husband not only designed and made passenger balloon airships, but also constructed built-to-order balloons. One of their customers was the United States Weather Bureau, which ordered scientific balloons to assist with weather forecasting. They constructed a made-to-order balloon for government rain-making experiments, and also military balloon equipment for the United States Army Signal Corps that was used in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Myers had a flight school at their farm home for flying lessons on passenger balloons. She performed many aerial demonstrations nationwide as a successful business. Myers and her husband's typical schedule was to arrive at a place around noon to unpack their equipment and set up. Once at the venue, they produced the hydrogen gas needed to inflate the balloon. They orchestrated everything necessary to manage a flight demonstration and afterwards packed up the balloon and equipment, clearing the town area for any subsequent events (e.g. dancing or bands). Myers did hundreds of out-of-town balloon demonstrations from 1880 to 1891, bringing in large audiences and huge crowds wherever she went. Over the course of her career she carried over a hundred thousand passengers aloft in a balloon, mostly on tethered short rides. One common exhibition she did throughout Pennsylvania was on Fourth of July Independence Day celebrations. Myers even did parachute jumps out of these high altitude balloons, which made her \\"Carlotta, the most daring lady aeronaut in the world.\\"  Patents  alt=An official patent document for an 1885 \\"guiding apparatus for balloons\\", featuring the image of a woman standing in a balloon gondola. Myers contributed to her husband's inventions with her own navigational mechanisms. The Louisiana Democrat newspaper reported on July 11, 1885, that Myers had obtained several patents pertaining to passenger balloons. Some in particular were described as guiding and steering apparatuses for passenger balloons. These were rudder and steering devices consisting of collapsible parts that could be opened and exposed to the air currents for navigation. Myers used her inventions in over 150 of her flights. The passenger gondola platform was described as made of expandable hammock netting surrounding the passenger. Myers described the navigation and steering capabilities of the airship as being achieved through the shortening and lengthening of the gondola hammock netting mesh, with a cloth screw propeller that would push her along like a boat propeller. Another of the steering devices was described as a 5-foot hoop connected to the back of the balloon platform by cords. The interaction of the guiding apparatus was described by Myers as that of a rudder on a light boat in water, where the balloon itself tipped and changed its plane level side-to-side depending on the positioning of the hoop steering device. She described it as altering the aerodynamics of the balloon airship. Her passenger balloon airship could be further manipulated for navigation by stepping on the edges of the gondola platform and warping the edges.  Records  * Myers was the first woman of the United States to pilot her own aircraft, which was a lighter-than-air passenger balloon. * Myers set an altitude world record for a passenger balloon, going four miles high (20,000 feet) in a balloon that held natural gas in its envelope. This accidental flight took place in 1888 in Franklin, Pennsylvania. She did this without oxygen assistant equipment. * Myers set a record for the highest number of one-woman piloted balloon trips ever done in the 19th century, making hundreds of ascents (more than all others combined). She took over 100,000 passengers with her. * According to Carl's calculations, Myers had made more balloon flights than any man in America by the time she retired in 1891.Heritage Magazine, August 1966, vol 17, issue 5; \\"...in 1891, she formally retired from exhibition flying... 'She retires from the field,' her husband announced to the public, 'with a record of having made more ascensions than all other women combined throughout the world, and more than any man living in America.'  Later years  Myers retired from flying passengers in 1891. She and her husband remained at the \\"Balloon Farm\\", where she continued test flying. In 1910 they sold the property and moved to Atlanta, Georgia to live with their daughter. Myers' husband died in 1925 at the age of 83 and she died in 1932.

Presently, Bulgaria introduced its own domestic supercar company, SIN Cars. History Austin Maestro Socialist Bulgaria has small auto industry including nearly 20 thousand units of self-developed Chavdar trucks and buses as well as the assembly of Soviet Moskvitch cars. From 1966 to 1970 in the city of Plovdiv was production of the Bulgarrenault. The factory assembled Renault 8 and Renault 10. Bulgaria produced the Fiat 850 and Fiat 124 between 1967 and 1971. They were unofficially called \\"Pirin-FIAT\\". The plant was in the town of Lovech. The same factory, called \\"Balkan\\", also assembled Moskvitch from 1967 to 1988. In 1994, Rover established Roadcar, a joint venture with a Bulgarian company to produce the Austin Maestro at a new factory in Varna, using CKD kits sent from the UK. Production began in July 1995 and 2,200 cars were assembled before the factory closed in April 1996. In 2012, Bulgaria's first domestic supercar manufacturer SIN Cars was founded as SIN Cars Limited by the Bulgarian engineer and racing driver Rosen Daskalov in Ruse, Bulgaria. The road-legal Sin R1 features a 6.2-litre V8 and 7.0 litre V8 engine Together with the Bulgarian company Litex Motors, Great Wall Motors has a production base in Bahovitsa, near Lovech. They assembly Voleex, Steed and Hover. The factory has an auto assembly capability of 50,000 vehicles annually. There are plans to increase to 70,000 vehicles annually in the next few years. Current manufacturers =SIN Cars= Sin R1 SIN Cars is a supercar manufacturer, founded SIN Cars Limited by the Bulgarian engineer and racing driver Rosen Daskalov in Great Britain in 2012. In 2015, the company started production of road Sin R1. The road-legal Sin R1 features a 6.2-litre V8 engine, producing 444 bhp and can reach 62 mph in 3.5 seconds. The company moved its headquarters to Munich, Germany and Ruse, Bulgaria. =Racing series= SIN entered the GT4 European Series for the 2015 season with the specified Sin R1 GT4 model. Sofia Car Motorsport finished on 8th place in the final standings. =Litex Motors= Litex Motors is an automobile manufacturing company based in Sofia, Bulgaria and the official partner of Great Wall Motors in Bulgaria. It assembles vehicles of the Chinese manufacturer at the jointly-developed facility located in Lovech, Bulgaria. It began manufacturing the Voleex C10 hatchback from knock-down kits in February 2012, in the first half of 2013, the Steed 5 was added to the line-up, and in November 2013, the Hover H6. On the Bulgarian market, the company markets the Voleex C10, Steed 5 and Hover H5 models, and from 2013, the Voleex C30, Voleex C20R and the Hover H6. The company has over 12 representative offices throughout Bulgaria, and in November 2012 it opened its first dealership outside the country, in Macedonia. After one year of manufacturing, the factory assembled over 1,000 units of the Voleex C10. In December 2013, the company performed its first regular export to Europe, a first batch of cars being sent to Italy. In August 2014, the company started exports to Romania, as a first step towards expanding its presence into Eastern Europe. Former manufacturers =Bulgaralpine= Bulgaralpine was a sports automobile produced in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and the result of a collaboration between Alpine (a French automobile firm) and ETO Bulet (a Bulgarian export trade organization). Production lasted for three years (1967‚Äì1969). Bulgaralpine GT 4 In the end of 1966 the founder of the French car company Alpine - Jean R√©d√©l√© - arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria, having been invited by the ETO (export trade organization) Bulet. Bulet was the same Bulgarian firm that had, through cooperation with Renault, already began the assembly of Bulgarrenault, and now had the same intention regarding Alpine. While in Bulgaria, R√©d√©l√© was introduced to the famed Bulgarian car racer Iliya Chubrikov, who was given the opportunity to test-drive the stunning Alpine A110 on the Circle Highway (at that time still in construction) around Sofia. Building on the good impressions made by his car, R√©d√©l√© made an attractive offer of cooperation to the Bulgarian side, and in early 1967 sent to Bulgaria several of his 1,000-cubic centimeters- displacement engines, two of which were installed into Bulgarrenault 8 bodies. Later that year, Iliya Chubrikov won first place in the Transbalkania rally. Shortly after that, R√©d√©l√© sent his engineering team to Bulgaria to prepare the assembly of Bulgaralpine and to train a Bulgarian team of automotive specialists. Iliya Chubrikov was hired by ETO Bulet in the capacity of a production manager for sports cars. In order to manufacture the fiberglass bodies, Bulgaria licensed the manufacturing method for a payment of 8 million French francs which secured the necessary machinery and tooling. The raw material for the manufacture of the fiberglass was initially imported from France but later came from the GDR (East Germany) and Poland. The first several Bulgaralpines were assembled at the end of 1967 when the stunning sports car was an absolute hit in Europe and the United States which of course gave a great deal of pride to Bulgaria. In 1968, two Bulgaralpine race cars, driven by the teams of Iliya and Nikola Chubrikov, and Atanas Taskov and Atanas Agura, took part in the Monte Carlo Rally for the very first time. For publicity purposes, ETO Bulet created an auto racing team of its own, composed by the brothers Chubrikov, the brothers Agura, Robert Kyurkchiev, Slavcho Georgiev and Atanas Taskov. The short-lived team nonetheless proved popular both in Bulgaria and abroad. All Bulgaralpine racecars were decommissioned after 1978 and never took part in another rally again. Bulgaralpine was not intended for the mass consumer in Bulgaria, instead being aimed at sports clubs and racing teams. However, some well-to-do consumers, such as the well- known Bulgarian film director Vassil Mirchev, bought a Bulgaralpine for private use. In 1969, Mirchev attended the Cannes film festival, covering the distance between Sofia, Bulgaria, and Cannes, France, in 16 hours in his Bulgaralpine. The price of Bulgaralpine in 1969 was 8,200 Bulgarian leva. The initial intentions were to produce one Bulgaralpine car per day, but even now it is difficult to say how many Bulgaralpines were built when production ended in 1969. Some sources state that only 60 cars were completed, others mention 120 (70 for sale in Bulgaria, and 50 - for export). The production manager and race car driver Iliya Chubrikov recalls about 100 completed cars, none of which were exported beyond Bulgaria's borders. =Bulgarrenault= Bulgarrenault (or Bulgar Renault) was an automobile produced in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and the result of a collaboration between Metalhim (a Bulgarian defence firm) and Bulet (a Bulgarian export trade organization). Production lasted for five years (1966-1970), during which the factory in Plovdiv produced two Renault models: the Renault 8 and the Renault 10. Bulgarrenault 8 In the middle of the 1960s, following the initiative of ETO (export trade organization) Bulet, a joint-venture was formed between Bulet and SPC (state production cooperative) Metalhim, with the purpose of building passenger cars. At the time, ETO Bulet was involved in the trade of all kinds of manufactured goods, while SPC Metalhim was a manufacturing cooperative uniting all national defense factories in Bulgaria. The basic idea was to purchase complete knock down (CKD) kits of passenger cars from abroad with Bulet's available hard-currency reserves, and then to assemble them in the factories owned by Metalhim. Several offers had already been made by foreign car manufacturers (such as Renault, Fiat, Simca, and Alfa Romeo), but Renault's offer was deemed to be the most attractive one. (The French automobile manufacturer's first offer was made on May 27, 1963, concerning the assembly of the Renault 4 and Renault 4L passenger cars.) On July 30, 1966, the Council of Ministers issued a formal authorization to SPC Metalhim to begin negotiations with Renault through the mediation of ETO Bulet. (Initially, the assembly of the cars was intended for a factory in the town of Cherven Bryag.) The official state newspaper Rabotnichesko Delo in its issue #261 of September 18, 1966, announced that ETO Bulet and Renault had signed a contract, and only two days later 10 passengers cars Renault 8 were shown at the Plovdiv Fair, rumored to have been assembled in the Military Factory in the town of Kazanlak. The cars were branded Bulgarrenault, and the upper left side of their windscreen bore a tricolor sticker with an inscription Bulet. Rabotnichesko Delo's issue of September 21, 1966, contained a quote from a senior manager at Renault regarding the just-signed contract with ETO Bulet, which planned that over 10,000 passengers cars model Renault 8 would be assembled in Bulgaria in 1970. =Chavdar= Chavdar B 13-20 Chavdar () is a trademark and name of a Bulgarian bus building company in Botevgrad. Founded by Racho Dzhambov, the company that would later become \\"Chavdar\\" produced around 200 buses between 1927 and 1947 on chassis from Ford Motor Company, Mercedes-Benz and Dodge. In 1948 the state took control of the property. Later Chavdar models were rebadged and restyled Setras. The company closed in 1999. In 1924 Racho Valkov Djambazov (1894-1983) opened an iron workshop in Botevgrad, Bulgaria. In 1927 Racho met with Ivan Valkov who had a transport business using rebuilt ambulances. He gave Racho one platform from Fiat and built his first vehicle. On 1 May 1948 Chavdar presented a bus based on ≈†koda RTO. In 1956 the production of the company increased 150%. An initiative by Vasil Djambov was to produce a ten-meter microbus based on Opel. In 1962 the company started to produce models M65 and M66, which were very popular for intercity traffic. In the same the began producing year small buses based on the Soviet GAZ-51(1962-1969). In 1966 a new engine arrived from the institute. At the end of the 1960s models M80 and M81 appeared, based on ≈†koda. In 1968 between 400 and 500 units were produced. That year the factory started modernization. New machines, new work strategy, new workplaces were described as the future success of the company. The company started a new contract with the Setra. In 1974 it started production of models 11G5 and 11M3. They were the company's biggest success. The minibus 5C was constructed from Kiril Hadjiev and Lubomir Toshev at the end of the 1970s. The bus created a product category called \\"midibus\\". In featured a 4 traction system and 14 seats. The first prototypes were tested in 1979. The buses were used from the small towns and villages in Bulgaria as a public bus, school bus and worker bus. The bus were used a Perkins engine. Chavdar exported products to USSR, Greece, North Korea, Afghanistan and Nicaragua. =Moskvitch (Bulgaria)= Moskvitch-2138/40 in Sofia. Moskvitch-21412 with 1.5 L engine. The Moskvitch was a 20th-century Soviet/Bulgarian passenger car. Between 1966 and 1990, the Balkan factory in Lovech, Bulgaria, assembled the Soviet-designed Moskvitch 408 (later replaced by the 412 / 1500 and Aleko) from complete knock down (CKD) kits. During the fall of 1965 Bulgaria and the USSR signed an economic cooperation agreement for the period of 1966-1970, which contained a provision that by the end of 1968 the Balkan factory in Lovech would be completely tooled for the assembly of 15,000 Moskvitch 408 passenger cars annually. In January 1966, a group of 20 Bulgarian engineers is sent to the MZMA (Moscow Factory for Compact Cars), later renamed to AZLK or Car Factory of the Lenin Communist Youth. By the end of July 1966 a total of 90 people (in three groups of 30 people each) were sent to the MZMA for training. Soon after that, the head engineer responsible for the construction of the new factory in Bulgaria, Aleksey Tatarinov, visited the city of Lovech, and the work on the project began. The first shipment of the complete knockdown kits, containing 900 parts each, arrived at the factory's rail ramp on October 17, 1966. The production began on October 25, 1966, and the first Moskvitch 408 production car left the production line at 3 p.m. on November 4, 1966. Until the end of 1966 a group of 7 workers was supposed to assemble a total of 32 cars, which would then be released to market. In early 1967 the Council of Ministers issued an official decision to rename Factory 14 to Factory for Passengers Cars Balkan. It was also decided to choose a new trademark for the car with a typically Bulgarian sound. The choice of a new trademark was put up for national debate in the pages of the Pogled newspaper, although the Bulgarian Language Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the Slavic Languages Department at the Sofia University, and the Union of Bulgarian Journalists participated in the discussion as well. The trademark finally chosen was Rila, although the name was used only unofficially and never appeared either in the cars' documentation or on the cars themselves. Initially, the assembly capacity of the factory was modest - only 564 Moskvitch cars were assembled during 1967. However, in 1968 2,500 cars were built, and the annual assembly capacity continued to increase progressively, reaching 8,000 cars in 1972. By that time, the assembly capacity was limited not by the factory itself, but by the capability of the Soviet supplier to produce enough complete knockdown kits to export to Bulgaria. The matter of manufacture of some parts and components for the car in the Lovech factory was discussed at that time, but nothing came out of it. After 1974, the quantity of kits imported from the USSR was fixed at 15,000 annually, which limitation remained in effect until the end of the 1980s (although during the record-setting 1984, 16,000 cars were assembled in Lovech). In 1976, the factory began to assemble the new freshened model Moskvitch 2138/2140 with engine displacement of 1360 or 1500 cubic centimeters, which engines were then also used in the models Moskvitch 408 and 412. The engines with displacement of 1360 cubic centimeters were dropped in 1979. Fiat 124 sedan In February 1987, the management of the Balkan factory, led by the then-managing director Baldzhiev, visited the AZLK to discuss the assembly of the new model Moskvitch 2141. During the series of meetings held with their Soviet counterparts, the Bulgarians expressed their desire to switch to a progressive assembly of 40% of the components of the car, with annual shipments of 50,000 complete knock-down kits by the Soviets; however, the managing director of the AZLK Kolomnikov indicated that his factory could not provide such a number of kits. The Bulgarian experts therefore concluded that a prospective assembly of the Moskvitch 2141 on the basis of the 15,000 (maximum 20,000) complete knockdown kits offered by the Soviets would be unprofitable and unfeasible. =Pirin-Fiat= Pirin-Fiat was the trademark of several passenger automobiles produced in Lovech, Bulgaria, and the result of a collaboration between Fiat (an Italian automobile firm) and SPC Balkankar (a Bulgarian state production cooperative). Production lasted for five years (1967-1971). Sofia-B On September 26, 1966, a meeting was held between the management of SPC (state production cooperative) Balkankar and representatives of the Italian automobile company Fiat. Subsequently, the Fiat representatives informed their management in Turin that SPC Balkankar wished to enter into a contract with Fiat, with performance to be given in several stages as follows: * Until the end of 1966, Fiat was to deliver 300-350 Fiat 850 passenger cars in complete knockdown (CKD) kits to be assembled by SPC Balkankar. * Until the end of 1967, Fiat was to deliver 3000-5000 Fiat 850 passenger cars in complete knockdown kits to be assembled by SPC Balkankar. *Fiat was to design a factory for the assembly and partial manufacture of automobiles, which was to begin operations in Bulgaria at a later date. * Fiat was to set up a network of service stations. * Fiat was to design and construct a warehouse for spare parts. The first 18 Fiat 850 cars arrived at the Factory for Passenger Cars Balkan in Lovech on May 10, 1967. After the Bulgarian side was trained in the assembly of the Fiats, it was decided to choose a Bulgarian-sounding trademark for the cars. The unofficial trademark was Pirin, but it was never featured on the cars themselves. The first Fiat 850 passenger car was assembled at the Balkan factory on June 27, 1967. On March 12, 1968, the first Fiat 850 cars based on variant 2A were received at the factory as complete knockdown kits. This was followed by the arrival of Fiat's permanent technical adviser on April 2. The assembly of Fiat 850 based on variant 2A began on April 4, 1968. Between April and May 1968, Bulgarian engineer Dimitar Damyanov was sent to Turin to sign a contract with Fiat regarding the delivery of welding and assembly machinery. Preslav truck from the 1980s On April 28, 1968, the Italian engineer Brasio arrived at the Balkan factory in Lovech as a technical adviser, and on December 13 of the same year the Italian specialists Mueller and Grimaldi arrive to install the painting machinery. The five-year contract between Balkankar and Fiat lapsed in 1971 and was not renewed. The last Fiat 850 left the Lovech factory in September 1971. =Sofia= Sofia was the name of two versions of two-passenger vehicles manufactured in Bulgaria in the 1980s and 1990s, from designer Velizar Andreev. = Preslav = Balkan mopeds in Varna museum Preslav was a truck manufacturer. The company were established in 1980. Preslav trucks were updated versions of trucks, which were made by Madara in Shumen. The company was closed in 2000. = Balkan = Balkan was a brand of motorcycles manufactured in Lovech, active between 1957 and 1975. The motorcycles were of three classes: 50cc, 75cc mopeds and 250cc two-stroke motorcycles similar to Jawa . A total of 271,562 pieces of all models were produced.

He was a moderate Chartist, and heavily involved in the campaign against \\"taxes on knowledge\\". Early life Moore was born in London 16 October 1810. He worked as a wood- carver, and in time employed his own staff. While young, he began to take a part in radical politics. He became in 1831 a member of the council of Sir Francis Burdett's National Political Union, and assisted Robert Owen's work in Gray's Inn Lane. Chartist In 1834 Moore was the leader of a deputation to Lord Melbourne on the question of the social condition of the people. He was a member of the committee for which William Lovett drew up the People's Charter in 1837, as a representative of the London Working-men's Association. In 1839 he was a member of the National Convention which met to promote the passing of the charter, was secretary of the committee which greeted Lovett and John Collins on their release from gaol in 1840, and joined forces with Lovett in the Working-men's Association in 1842. He took part in its meetings in the National Hall, Holborn. Moore supported the Chartist cause, but not the \\"physical force\\" party, and never overstated what the Charter could achieve for the working classes. He joined the People's International League of 1847, set up by Thomas Cooper and William James Linton, with Lovett and John Parry. When the People's Charter Union (CPU) was formed on 10 April 1848, he was appointed its treasurer. Aftermath of Chartism In 1849 Moore took up the reform with which he became most involved, the abolition of tax stamps on newspapers. He lobbied Richard Cobden to adopt it, as a way to keep the working and middle classes in touch over financial reforms. The Charter Union appointed a committee on the tax stamp issue, the National Stamp Abolition Committee (NSAC); the NSAC was in effect the successor to the CPU. It met at Moore's house, and he became its permanent chairman. Between 7 March 1849, when the NSAC was formed, and the repeal of the paper duty in June 1861, Moore attended 390 related meetings. During the same period he was an advanced radical, a steady colleague of Lovett, Henry Hetherington, and James Watson. Hetherington and Watson were original NSAC members; G. J. Holyoake and James Stansfeld then joined. Holyoake sought allies, such as those working to have duties on advertising and paper scrapped, bringing in Charles Cowan. The NSAC was absorbed after two years by the Association for Promoting the Repeal of Taxes on Knowledge (APRTK or APRTOK), and Moore was one of its most active members, sharing the organisational tasks with Collet Dobson Collet. The officers of the APRTK, set up in 1851, were Thomas Milner Gibson (President), Collet (Secretary), Moore (Chairman), and Francis Place (Treasurer). While the officers were not much affected, the rest of the committee was populated by middle-class radicals, with Cobden dominant; included were John Bright, George Dawson, Charles Gilpin, G. H. Lewes and Edward Miall. The APRTK continued to campaign, on the issue of postal rates for distribution of newspapers. The matter was addressed in the Post Office Act 1870. A final meeting took place that year, in Moore's house. Later life Moore was a member of the Society of the Friends of Italy, the Jamaica Committee, and of numerous other committees and societies. He worked to promote electoral purity in Finsbury, where he had lived from 1832, and assisted in managing the Regent's Park Sunday band. He died on 7 December 1878. Family Moore married, on 9 December 1836, Mary Sharp of Malton, North Yorkshire, a niece of James Watson the publisher and Chartist. She and four of their children survived him.

Dip Ed. Dip Clin Psych. AFBPsS. C.Psychol Roy Shuttleworth is a Consultant in Clinical Psychology, chartered by the British Psychological Society (BPS). He was a Senior Psychologist at Long Grove Hospital, Epsom, the Founding Chair of the British Association for Drama Therapy and Principal Therapist at the Family Institute in Cardiff. Following a period working in Hong Kong, Roy entered private practice in London and the West Country, working mainly in the Harley Street area.  Early life  Roy Edward Shuttleworth was born in Cairo to English parents. His father was an RAF pilot. He is the eldest of 4 children, and when he was 7 years old the family moved to Australia.  Career  He received a Bachelor of Science Degree from Melbourne University, and then a teaching qualification (Dip.Ed) from the same establishment, and taught Science in secondary schools in Melbourne, later moving to London and working as a supply teacher for several months, prior to entering the Psychological profession. He gained his qualifications in Clinical Psychology in London, specialising in Adult and Adolescent Psychology. He became the Senior Psychologist at the Regional Adolescent Unit at Long Grove Hospital, Epsom, where he helped to develop some innovative treatment techniques, in particular Psychodrama. and Family Therapy. His Family Therapy training was with Dr Robin Skynner, a pioneer in the UK for this treatment approach. His Drama Therapy. and its associated Play Therapy techniques were developed under the guidance of Sue Jennings Roy later went on to write a number of papers about these techniques in their application to adults, children and adolescents, as well as being involved in extensive training courses. Recounting one such conference appearance, the Times Educational Supplement noted of Roy's contribution \\"Then - suddenly the meeting came alive\\" as he defined and demonstrated psychodrama techniques with the audience. He later became the Founding Chair of the British Association for Drama Therapy, and was involved as an external examiner for two Drama Therapy courses. He next moved to Cardiff in 1979 where he became the Principal Therapist at the Family Institute. This was a pioneering organisation, funded by Barnardo's, which as well as providing treatment for families, was also a major training organisation, and involved in research. Roy was particularly interested in helping families stay together, and when not possible, providing the circumstance under which the least damage would be done to the family members. Together with his colleagues including Brian Cade, Peter Hudson, Bebe Speed, Phillipa Seligman and Harvey Jones, he developed techniques for helping families become 'unstuck', when they continued to repeat the same negative stereotypic behaviour, which was very destructive to the family process. Techniques were developed within the framework of the 'Brief Therapy, Strategic Movement', as well as Family Systems Therapy to help release the family from these negative patterns. After a period in Hong Kong, dealing with expatriate stress and general psychological disorders, Roy returned in 1988 to private practice in London and the West Country, the former being mainly in the Harley Street area, working with some outstanding psychiatrists and psychologists, such as Denis Friedman, Lewis Clein, Gerald Woolfson, Robert Sharpeand and John Adams, on a wide range of psychological disorders. With long experience in a variety of settings dealing with mental disorders, there is probably no psychological disorder that Roy has not been involved with. In addition he has worked in a more medical area using psychological approaches. These have included working with the Harley Street dermatologist Dr David Fenton on patients with skin and hair conditions where there may be some element of psychological difficulties in either dealing with an unwanted condition or where various stresses may lead to the problem. He has also worked with a number of hearing specialists, such as Johnathan Hazell, particularly attempting to help people with Tinnitus. Roy has attended patients at hospitals including the Nightingale, Priory and Cromwell. While he continues to see patients in his practice, in recent years he has increasingly moved into the forensic area, psychologically assessing people with a variety of charges hanging over them such as violence, trauma, general criminal acts such as stealing and alleged sex crimes. He has a particular interest in the assessment and treatment of PTSD, treating both children and adults Roy has also acted as consultant and psychologist for numerous television, news and media productions, including Wife Swap, School of Saatchi and CNN News, ranging from assessing candidates for reality TV to discussing issues on camera.  Personal life  Roy is married to the Australian concert pianist Rosemary Tuck. He has two adult children from a previous relationship.

They were braced together on each side with struts from the lower wingtips with two parallel pairs of streamlined struts, one pair leaning outwards and the other inwards; wire cross bracing strengthened the structure. A pair of N-form struts supported both the inner upper wing and the centrally positioned, pusher configuration, Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr liquid-cooled V12 engine. The engine sat on the wing in a flat-sided cowling, with its honeycomb radiator at the front and a three-bladed propeller working in a rectangular cut-out in the trailing edge. The LeO H-23-2 had a wooden framed hull covered in birch plywood. Its planing bottom had a convex V-section quite different from the softly curved underside of the LeO H-23. There were two steps, one under the wings and the other at about two-thirds of the way back from the reinforced nose. Single-stepped floats, each mounted on two pairs of short struts from the tips of the lower wings ensured lateral stability on water. In the nose was an open position from which a crew member could take observations or bearings, assist with mooring or, in event of attack, uses a pair of machine guns on a flexible mounting. He could also release four bombs, held under the lower wings. Immediately behind this position was the pilots' open cockpit, which had side-by-side seats equipped with dual controls. Their seats were well separated to allow access to the front post via a door and had their own fuselage openings, windscreens and headrests. Passage rearwards between the seats led to a large cabin with windows for observation, containing radio equipment, a mapping table and a camera mounted for vertical or oblique photographs. Behind that was a dorsal gun position with another pair of flexibly mounted machine guns. Aft of the rear step, the hull became slender and then blended into a tall fin. Some images show the rudder unbalanced and the same height as the fin but others show a taller balanced rudder. At some point after the rudder was balanced, small auxiliary fins were added to the tailplane tips. The tailplane was mounted over halfway up the central fin, each side braced from below by a pair of parallel struts. The LeO H-23-2 was an amphibious aircraft with conventional tailwheel landing gear. Each wheel, fitted with low pressure tyres and brakes, was on a cranked axle with a drag strut, both hinged from the hull side, and another leg which was vertical when the gear was down; the fuselage hinge also mounted an inverse V-strut, its vertex on the top of the vertical leg. All three joined the bottom end of an oblique Messier retracting shock absorber which projected inwards above the wing. Retracted, the wheel was exposed under the wing, at about 30¬∞ to it. The castoring tailwheel was attached just aft of the rear step and had a rubber shock absorber. Development The LeO H-23-2 was afloat by May 1932 though the date of the first flight is not known. It appeared at the 13th Paris Aero Salon in November 1932. Since 1920 France had aeronautical connections with Venezuela and supplied most of their military aircraft from about 1920 to 1935. The LeO H-23-2 attracted their Salon delegation's interest and an order for three followed. These had some modifications to the float depth and to the engine cowling. Unusually, the aircraft were paid for with sacks of coffee beans. They went on to serve their country well. Little is known about the career of the prototype, though when it flew at a display of naval aircraft in March 1936 it was described as a trainer.

His disappearance has been linked to that of several other children in the area, collectively known as the Disparus de l'Is√®re (literally, the \\"Disappeared of the Is√®re\\"). Ludovic's whereabouts remain unknown to this day.  Disappearance  Six-year-old Ludovic Janvier disappeared from Saint-Martin-d'H√®res on Thursday 17 March 1983. He was last seen in Place de la R√©publique, on the way home with his two brothers, J√©r√¥me (8) and Nicolas (2¬Ω). They had gone to buy cigarettes for their father sometime between 6:30 and 7:45 pm. Investigation Several witnesses testified that a man wearing a construction-style hard hat, blue work overalls and black heavy-duty zip-up shoes approached the boys and said to them: \\"I've lost my wolf-dog. If you help me find him, I'll buy you sweets.\\" The man allegedly asked them to separate in two different directions. J√©r√¥me and Nicolas went one way, and the unknown man left in the other direction with Ludovic in hand. J√©r√¥me and Nicolas returned home and told their father what had happened. Their father then informed the police. Later that year, the clerk of a court judge in Grenoble received a phone call informing her that the child had been adopted by a new family. The anonymous correspondent claimed to have read this in the newspaper L'Union de Reims. On 23 May 1985, police found the body of a child in the nearby Vercors Cave System. The body was never identified. Aftermath Around 2010, Virginie ‚Äì Ludovic's sister ‚Äì received a phone call from a nurse at a hospital near Reims, a French city 600 km (370 miles) to the north. The nurse claimed to have seen someone resembling J√©r√¥me, Ludovic's older brother. She recognised the now adult J√©r√¥me after seeing him in a news report about Ludovic's disappearance. In 2011, the Grenoble authorities announced that they were reopening Ludovic Janvier's case, as well as that of another girl in the \\"Disparus de l'Is√®re\\" investigation. Their disappearances were reclassified as \\"illegal confinement\\". In 2013, Ludovic's mother appealed to the authorities in an attempt to find out whether the body of the unidentified child found in 1985 was that of her son. In 2014, the Grenoble authorities announced that they were closing Ludovic Janvier's case. The family's lawyers, Didier Seban and Corinne Herrmann, hope to appeal this decision on the basis of witness statements which they believe have not been followed up. In 2015, the Court of Appeal reopened the case and ordered new investigations.

A keen fisherman he held the claim to fame for catching one of Scotland‚Äôs largest ever halibut .Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh: Obituary: Dec 1992) He believed that education, and teaching, should be enjoyable. His nickname amongst pupils was Cappy Dick. Life He was born on 23 January 1905 in St Abbs on the south-east Scottish coast, the son of a lobster-fisherman. He was educated in St Abbs then strongly encouraged to continue his education at Berwickshire High School due to his clear talent. He then undertook teacher training at the newly created Moray House School of Education in Edinburgh. From there he won a place to study chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a first class degree. In 1931 he received a post of Science Master at Annan Academy on the south-west coast of Scotland. From 1936 he taught at George Watson‚Äôs College in Edinburgh. He also was Commanding Officer of the school‚Äôs Combined Cadet Force from this date and throughout the Second World War. In 1947 his shooting team won a bronze medal at Bisley. From 1948 he became Head of Chemistry at the school and from 1958 Head of Science. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in later life, in March 1963. His proposers were Mowbray Ritchie, James Kendall, Neil Campbell, and Sir Edmund Hirst. In teaching, he was credited from rescuing both Huntly Lorimer (now a Fellow of the Royal Society) and Lord Robert Hunter from academic obscurity and steering them towards an interest in science. In this he exemplifies the role of a true teacher. He was the first schoolteacher to be made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.

He succeeded Owoye Andrew Azazi as Chief of Army Staff. Education & background Yusuf was born on September 22, 1952 in Bara-Kagoma, Kaduna State. He attended the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) and was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant into the Nigerian Army Artillery Corps in 1975 and was a member of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) Course 14. Others in his NDA class were officers such as former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Paul Dike Career Yusuf served as Commander of the Nigerian military contingent to United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) before being appointed in 2006 as Commander in Charge of the Armed Forces of Liberia by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Upon Yusuf's appointment as Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff by President Umaru Yar Adua in 2007, Liberia's President awarded General Yusuf with Liberia's Honor of Distinguished Service. He will always be remembered for his contributions in the area of bringing peace to the troubled Niger Delta Region where he described the militants as misguided children. He said that though the Nigerian Army has the wherewithal to deal with the militants, it was better for the nation to take the path of dialogue than confronting the militants in an all out offensive. He also said all soldiers had the right to sue the army if they felt they had been slighted in any way and if any judgment was given in favour of the complainants, the army would abide by any court ruling. His words, ‚ÄúI am a fulfilled man, we have been able to achieve monumental feats because, compared to the last 30 years, the difference in the last one year has been immense. We set the Army on a transformation path, we beefed up training, Eagle Ex-Ring 1V 2007 and NADCEL 2008 is an attestation to this fact. In addition to several unit level trainnings, preparations are currently on for others now. My appeal, however, is that the maintenance of our equipment should not be compromised.‚Äô‚Äô He said, ‚Äúwe were 101 that got admission into NDA in 1973; only 67 came through two years later. Today, 28th of August 2008, I am the last man standing among the 14th Regular Course. I am an extremely fulfilled man. I am proud to have tasted battles and commanded the Nigerian Army, the pride of every soldier‚Äù. Yusuf was very particular about the welfare of his men. ‚ÄúNever in the history of the Army have barracks been renovated enblock as five barracks are slated for renovation, meaning that in four years, all Army barracks in the country would have been renovated. We also made sure that our troops on peace support operations get their full allowances as stipulated by the United Nations. It has never happened before‚Äù.

Biography Kathy Niakan obtained a BSc in cell and molecular biology and a BA in English literature from the University of Washington. In 2005, Niakan obtained her PhD in stem cell and developmental biology from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she worked in the laboratory of Edward McCabe. She went on to be a research fellow with Kevin Eggan at Harvard University, working with human and mouse stem cells to study human embryogenesis and cell potency. She then moved to the University of Cambridge Anne McLaren Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology in the Cambridge Biomedical Campus where she continued to investigate the molecular basis of early cell development in humans and mice. In 2013, Niakan became a group leader at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in London. Since 2015, she has been a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, the successor institute to the NIMR. She was a finalist in the inaugorary UK Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists in 2019. Research At the Francis Crick Institute she is investigating the mechanisms of lineage specification in human embryos and stem cells. In February 2016 Niakan was given the go- ahead by the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to genetically modify human embryos. The embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.

Insurance Company of North America was the sponsor. Background Following the demise of the traditional weekly Bing Crosby variety show in the spring of 1954, to be replaced by a nightly 15 minute ‚Äòdisc-jockey‚Äô format show, radio listeners missed out on a full-fledged, half-hour Christmas program hosted by Crosby for the first time in twenty years. In 1955, this situation was remedied when Crosby, the undisputed voice of Christmas at the time, embarked on one of his most ambitious radio projects ever; a transcribed one-hour Christmas spectacular featuring guest artists that spanned the entire globe. It was called \\"A Christmas Sing with Bing\\" and the success of the initial broadcast resulted in the show running each year until 1962. Program One The first show was broadcast at 9 pm, on CBS on Christmas Eve, 1955 and it was carried by some 200 stations along with hook-ups on the CBC, AFRS, and VOA for a truly global listening experience. For the ‚Äòaround the world‚Äô aspect, the program included cut-in‚Äôs of carols and hymns from France, Rome, and Canada, along with stops in the U.S. at St. Louis, Salt Lake City, and Hollywood. The show was scripted as though it was ‚Äòlive\\" and listeners heard Crosby introducing his own songs and choirs from other parts of the world as though it was all happening on Christmas Eve. Crosby had actually recorded his contribution on December 19, 1955. The songs heard were: #\\"Happy Holiday\\" ‚Äì (Paul Weston & his Orchestra, Norman Luboff Choir) #\\"Joy to the World\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing ‚Äì (St. Louis Christmas Carols Association Choir) #\\"White Christmas\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Adeste Fideles\\" ‚Äì (Little Singers of Granby) #\\"We Three Kings of Orient Are\\" ‚Äì (Mormon Tabernacle Choir) #\\"The First Nowell\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Carol of the Bells\\" ‚Äì (The Voices of Christmas) #\\"What Christmas Means to Me\\" ‚Äì (Delores Short) #\\"Good King Wenceslas\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Jesus Sauveur Adorable\\" ‚Äì (Traditional) - (Neuilly Boys Choir) #\\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" ‚Äì (Reed Warblers Choir) #\\"Away in a Manger\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Tu Scendi Dalle Stelle\\" ‚Äì (The Vatican Choir) #\\"Deck the Halls\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\" ‚Äì (Dedham Choral Society) #\\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Silent Night\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby) #\\"Happy Holiday (reprise)\\" ‚Äì (Bing Crosby, Norman Luboff Choir) The broadcast attracted a huge audience and Variety magazine commented: \\"Insurance Company of America laid out some $30,000 for this Christmas Eve ‚ÄòSing with Bing Hour‚Äô and that might be figured as cheap considering the promotion values‚Ä¶. If there was an important Christmas carol left out by either Der Bingle or the pick-up points, it didn‚Äôt come to mind‚Ä¶\\" CBS had run a ‚ÄòWhat Christmas Means to Me Contest‚Äô for children and they reported that over 70,000 entries were received. The winner was seven year-old Delores Short who had spent her whole life in Pine Ridge, Kentucky Children‚Äôs Home. She duly read her letter on the show. Decca Records issued an LP of the program (slightly edited and minus the commercials) in time for the 1956 Holiday market and this too was well received. Crosby had not recorded with Paul Weston before and it turned out to be a happy combination. Weston had been music director at Capitol Records and then at Columbia where he built a reputation for his mood music with albums such as \\"Music for Dreaming\\". He was married to Jo Stafford who worked with Crosby on a number of occasions. Norman Luboff was the founder and conductor of the choir bearing his name, one of the leading choral groups of the 1950s, 60s and 70s. They toured yearly from 1963 to 1987, and recorded more than seventy-five albums. The holiday albums \\"Songs of Christmas\\" (1956) and \\"Christmas with the Norman Luboff Choir\\" (1964) were perennial bestsellers for years. Program Two Following the success of the first show, plans were made for a second show and this was broadcast over the CBS network on December 24, 1956. The sponsor was again the Insurance Company of North America. The same basic formula was followed with the addition of the inclusion of Maurice Chevalier in Paris and Sarah Churchill in London, extending their compliments of the season to Hollywood. Crosby added \\"Adeste Fideles\\" and \\"Jingle Bells\\" to five of the carols he used the previous year, and Rosemary Clooney was heard singing \\"Away in a Manger\\", by way of a lullaby to her children, Miguel Ferrer and Maria Ferrer. Nine-year-old Edward Tuchawena, from a Hopi Indian Village 80 miles outside Flagstaff, Arizona, read his winning letter of \\"What Christmas Means to Me\\". Canada was represented by a choir from Ottawa, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir returned to sing a movement from Handel's \\"Messiah\\". The same recording of \\"Tu scendi dalle stelle\\" by the Vatican Choir from the 1955 broadcast was also played. The first six \\"Christmas Sing with Bing\\" shows appear to have relied, almost entirely, on permutations from a master tape of around a dozen traditional carols by Crosby plus 'White Christmas'. In retrospect the device is glaringly obvious but after an interval of 52 weeks, the average listener would not have been aware of the 'deception' or indeed, worried too much. Variety reviewed the broadcast saying, \\"\\"On Christmas Eve, a songfest with Bing Crosby, interlaced with other show biz personalities, as well as pickups from many corners of the globe, proved to be good listening, showcasing radio as a still dazzling entertainment medium, the mobility of which is hard to beat‚Ä¶\\" Program Three December 24, 1957 saw the third broadcast with the same cast and sponsor. Crosby repeated six of the songs heard in the first two programs. In the same program, Gary Crosby (still in army uniform, at that time) exchanged greetings with his father from Salzburg while introducing an Austrian choir singing \\"Silent Night\\" in their native language. The Vatican Choir recording of \\"Tu scendi dalle stelle\\" from the 1955 broadcast was again used, and another excellent number was rendered by a Dutch children‚Äôs choir from The Hague. Canada was represented by Man√©canterie des Petits Chanteurs de la Vierge, from Montreal, singing \\"Les Anges Dans Nos Campagnes\\", and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sang another movement from Handel's \\"Messiah\\". Other numbers featured choirs from Minneapolis and Jerusalem in addition to one number by the Insurance Company of North America‚Äôs chorus. Unlike the previous two years, no children's letters were read on the program. Variety thought that, \\"Sing with Bing\\" is developing into a standard Christmas Eve radio offering‚Ä¶Taped in advance, show nevertheless came through with the right holiday flavour... Program Four Christmas Eve, 1958 saw the fourth in the series and of the seven carols/songs used, six had been heard at least twice, previously. The sole variation was provided by the first appearance of Kathryn Crosby who duetted with her husband on \\"Away in a Manger\\", dedicated to 'Tex', aka the four month-old Harry Lillis III who \\"is listening at home to the radio, right now.\\" Canada was represented by the St. George's Cathedral Choir from Kingston, Ontario, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir again made an appearance, singing \\"Beautiful Savior\\". Instead of the usual recording from the Vatican Choir, this year had the Roman Singers of Sacred Music sing an original composition, \\"Christus Est\\". Additional music was provided by choirs from Anchorage, Alaska; Sydney, Australia; Albertson, New York; Cannes, France; Honolulu, Hawaii; and the men from the nuclear submarine USS Nautilus. Variety commented, inter alia, \\"CBS Radio established the Christmas Sing with Bing pattern four years ago and it still holds up as an easy and comfortable programming segment for Yule listening. With Crosby crooning and emceeing around-the-world pickup for Christmas festivities, the hour rolls by in a familiar but still enjoyable way.\\" Program Five Little is known about the Christmas Eve 'Sing' of 1959, apart from the fact that the usual participants, i.e. Paul Weston's Orchestra and the Norman Luboff Choir were in attendance and that a new song was featured by Crosby. \\"It's Christmas\\" was repeated in the show of the following year but strangely enough, although recorded by others, it does not appear to have been used by Crosby in any other context. Program Six A change was made to the 'Around the World' theme for the Christmas Eve, 1960 program. The international flavour of season's past was dropped for a stay at home session with Rosemary Clooney, Crosby‚Äôs regular CBS radio partner, her husband Jos√© Ferrer and Crosby's own wife Kathryn. They employed a wide category of Christmas songs from the newer pop standards right down to old-fashioned carols. There was a medley of some of Crosby‚Äôs Christmas pop hits with Clooney consisting of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" and a rendition of \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\" by the entire cast. Ferrer added a reading of \\"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\\" - the 1897 New York Sun editorial. Variety welcomed the change in format and also commented: \\"This was the sixth 'Christmas Sing with Bing. and the Yuletide Eve special is well on its way to becoming an institution which is all for the best since Crosby has that special sense of hominess and belonging that adds an extra kind of warmth to a season when the Christmas song-fests tend to lose their individuality. The 'Sing with Bing‚Äô remains something special, to look forward to each year‚Ä¶Far too many commercials for Insurance Company of North America and pretty hard sell at that. 'Sing with Bing‚Äô being almost an institution it seems about time the commercial aspect of it be accorded appropriately similar treatment.\\" Program Seven The seventh broadcast was heard on December 24, 1961 and Kathryn Crosby, Edgar Bergen and Jo Stafford (a late substitute for Rosemary Clooney who was ill) comprised the guest list, alongside the usual cast. Crosby's version of \\"Joy to the World\\", from the inaugural show and \\"Jingle Bells\\", first heard on the second program, had now become 'regulars'. Crosby and Stafford duetted on a medley of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\", \\"Silver Bells\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\". Crosby and his wife sang \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" together. A clip edited from a 1955 edition of radio's Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy Show was inserted, featuring nine year-old Candice Bergen playing the part of 'Charlie McCarthy's sister'. Program Eight The final show in the series was transmitted on December 24, 1962. Earlier that year, Crosby had recorded a new album of Christmas songs entitled \\"I Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" and the opportunity was taken to promote this. Kathryn Crosby, Rosemary Clooney and Johnny Mercer covered eight of the fourteen titles on the recently completed album. Crosby started with the title song, \\"I Wish You a Merry Christmas\\". Clooney sang \\"The Littlest Angel\\" and \\"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\" and joined Mercer for \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\". Mercer sang his own individual version of \\"The Glow-Worm\\". Crosby joined Clooney and Mercer for \\"Winter Wonderland\\".

He was born on August 14, 1745 in Kingston, Jamaica, the only child of Michael Hay from Edinburgh, Scotland and Esther Wilkins. He was named after his great aunt, Ann Mister, sister of Martin Wilkes, father of his mother. Military service Hay was a colonel in the 2nd regiment of the Orange County, New York militia and observed enemy operations in the Haverstraw Bay of the Hudson River. On July 25, 1776, he reported to General George Washington about the actions of and in the bay. Another example was on March 23, 1777, when he reported about enemy operations against Peekskill, New York. Later, in the fall of 1777, his house and farm buildings in Haverstraw, New York were burned down by British raiders. From July 15 to July 18, 1778, Hay's temporary residence, that of his brother-in- law William Smith in what is now West Haverstraw, served as headquarters for Washington. His farm was raided again in the summer of 1779 by the British. Private life Hay went with Issac Wilkins to study at King's College (now Columbia University). On October 5, 1763, he married Martha Smith (June 18, 1745 ‚Äì March 30, 1821), daughter of Judge William Smith of Haverstraw and then returned to Kingston. After several unsuccessful attempts to start a family, the couple returned to Haverstraw and purchased approximately 200 acres of land near the Minisceongo Creek in December 1773.

The addition of object thickness adds a third input to the two x-ray energies used by DXA, better solving the equation for bone and excluding more efficiently these soft tissues components.  Background  The body consists of three main components: bone mineral, lean soft tissue (skin, blood, water and skeletal muscle) and adipose tissue (fat and yellow bone marrow). These different components have different x-ray attenuating properties. The standard in bone mineral density scanning developed in the 1980s is called Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, known as DXA. The DXA technique uses two different x-ray energy levels to estimate bone density. DXA scans assume a constant relationship between the amounts of lean soft tissue and adipose tissue. This assumption leads to measurement errors, with an impact on accuracy as well as precision. To reduce soft-tissue errors in DXA, DXL technology was developed in the late 1990s by a team of Swedish researchers led by Prof. Ragnar Kullenberg. With DXL technology, the region of interest is scanned using low and high energy x-rays as with a DXA scan. The improvement to DXA with DXL is that, for each pixel scanned by DXA, the exact thickness of the measured object is also measured using lasers. The DXL results allow for a more accurate estimation of bone density by using three separate inputs (low and high x-ray energies plus thickness) rather than two for each pixel in the measuring region.  DXL - Technical description  Using the DXL technique, for each measuring point (or pixel) the following equations apply: N1 = N01‚ãÖexp(-(ŒΩb1‚ãÖtb‚ãÖœÉb + ŒΩs1‚ãÖts‚ãÖœÉs + ŒΩf1‚ãÖtf‚ãÖœÉf)) N2 = N02‚ãÖexp(-(ŒΩb2‚ãÖtb‚ãÖœÉb + ŒΩs2‚ãÖts‚ãÖœÉs + ŒΩf2‚ãÖtf‚ãÖœÉf)) T = tb + ts + tf Where: * N1 and N2 are the detected x-ray counts after passing through the region of interest. * N01 and N02 are the detected x-ray counts taken from the internal phantom. * tb, ts and tf are the thickness of bone (b), lean soft tissue (s) and adipose tissue (f), respectively. * T is the total thickness at the measuring point. * ŒΩb1, ŒΩs1 and ŒΩf1 are the x-ray attenuation coefficients for each component at the low x-ray energy level. * ŒΩb2, ŒΩs2 and ŒΩf2 are the x-ray attenuation coefficients for each component at the high x-ray energy level. * œÉb, œÉs and œÉf are the densities of bone, lean soft tissue and adipose tissue, respectively. tb * œÉb is the unknown bone density that one wants to calculate, e.g. areal mass (g/cm2).  DXL technology used in clinical practice  DXL Calscan Bone densitometry The DXL technique is used in the bone densitometry system DXL Calscan, manufactured and marketed by the company Demetech AB, T√§by, Sweden. Many published studies have evaluated the DXL technique using the DXL Calscan system, which scans the subject‚Äôs heel. Several published fracture studies have shown that heel scans using DXL Calscan have an ability to predict fractures as well or better than the DXA technique scanning the hip.

He is primarily known for his writing on opera and opera singers, especially his 1982 book, The Last Prima Donnas. Born in Florence, he was the son of an Italian aristocrat and an American mother. From the late 1940s to the early 1960s Rasponi was the publicity agent for many opera singers as well as for socialites and fashionable restaurants in New York City. For a while, he also owned the Sagittarius Gallery in Manhattan which specialised in introducing contemporary European artists. After a financial scandal in 1963, he left the United States for Italy and dedicated himself to writing. He spent his last years in Rio de Janeiro where he died at the age of 68.

After the war, he resumed his career as a music journalist and also began working for the public relations firm Hope Associates which handled publicity for the Metropolitan Opera. Then in 1948 he and Frank Chapman, a former opera singer and the husband of Gladys Swarthout, formed the public relations firm Chapman‚ÄìRasponi. However, they soon fell out and Rasponi opened his own firm, Rasponi Associates. His first two clients were the opera singer Licia Albanese and the cosmetics tycoon Elizabeth Arden. He soon added other opera singers, including Renata Tebaldi, Franco Corelli, and Cesare Siepi, as well as the fashionable New York restaurants Quo Vadis and The Colony.Opera News (1972).

His fields of research are mainly French theater and film. He taught theater at the Sorbonne, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Bar Ilan University and the Hebrew University (1982-2012). Moraly organized numerous symposiums and an annual Student Theater Festival at the Department of Theater Studies of the Hebrew University.  Research  In his researches, Moraly undermines generally admitted cultural images. His recent research is devoted to the representations of Jewish characters in Occupied France's Theater and Film: articles include Les Enfants du Paradis, Volpone, La Folle de Chaillot that were published in Revolution in Paradise: Veiled representations of Jewish characters in Occupied France. The purpose of the book is to show that, contrary to the accepted view, some of these films were intimately linked to the political situation. They convey the demonization of characters that, while not specifically presented as Jews nevertheless manifested anti-Semitic stereotypes of the Jew as ugly, rootless, low, hypocritical, immoral, cruel and power hungry. All movies analysed (Les Inconnus dans la maison; Les Visiteurs du Soir ; L‚ÄôEternel retour ; Les Enfants du Paradis) present characters not identified as Jews but who exhibit negative ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù traits, in contrast to the aristocratic characters whom they aspire to emulate. They demonstrate, implicitly, central themes of explicit anti-Semitic propaganda. = Jean Genet = His first book: Jean Genet, la vie √©crite opposed Genet's official image (as an uncultured outlaw) and showed Jean Genet to be a highly cultured writer whose need to write determined all the aspects of his life. The book became a point of reference for research on Genet's work. Le Ma√Ætre fou analyses Genet's theoretical texts on theater and art. These texts, neglected by scholarship, offer a key for the comprehension of Genet's dramatic work and are a deep reflexion about the powers and the limits of artistic creation. In this book, Moraly focuses on Genet's texts both on theatre and, more broadly, on aesthetics, from his study of Cocteau to his essay \\"That Strange Word...\\" (1967) and including writings on his various plays and also on L√©onor Fini, Rembrandt, Giacometti, and \\"The Tightrope Walker\\", texts in which, Moraly states, Genet analyses his own views on the creation, function, and power of art. = Paul Claudel = The second theme of his research, the theatrical creation of Paul Claudel, is not so far from the first as it may seem. In Claudel metteur en sc√®ne : la fronti√®re entre les deux mondes, Moraly opposes the accepted image of Claudel as a paragon of arri√®re-garde theater. The book reveals unknown aspects of Claudel's work: his ballets, his theatrical experiments and his exploration of a new kind of musical theater.  Playwright  Moraly is also a playwright. His plays have been produced and published in France and in other countries : Les Catcheuses , Sissi en enfer ; Cendrillon ; Gimpel ; Le Tombeau des poup√©es; Strip; Etrangle-moi, mon amour ;The Barcelona Dispute ; La Musique ; Voices; Les merveilles du fond des mers ou un chef d'≈ìuvre √† gonfler soi-m√™me.

The Hundred of Cunyarie was proclaimed in 1922 and the town was surveyed in November 1927. Land was released, surveyed and apportioned on an application basis, with the latest sections being surveyed as late as the 1960s and 1970s. However, the limiting factor for early settlers was the availability of water, and allocations were generally preferentially selected around rare rocky outcrops or uplands which could afford some opportunities for increased runoff into earthen dams. Indeed, access to water was a critical factor in European settlement of Eyre Peninsula. Settlement in the area was spurred by the completion of the railway line to Port Lincoln, which reached Buckleboo (the next town on from Cunyarie, and end of the line) in 1926. The town of Cunyarie was surveyed and proclaimed in 1927-28, but declared as ceased to exist in 1962. The town was named for the railway siding, which was named for the cadastral hundred, which in turn was named after the Cunyarie Rockhole in the area, which provides a pool of water in a sheet of exposed granite.

The incident resulted in media and academic discussions regarding race relations and the impact of police investigations on free speech. A Londoner of Turkish Cypriot ancestry, Mustafa worked as the welfare and diversity officer of Goldsmiths Students' Union and was a self-described feminist and anti-racist activist. In early 2015 she organised several events at Goldsmiths, University of London in which white students, and in another case both white and male students, were banned. This attracted national attention, with commentators criticising this as racial segregation and accusing Mustafa of racism and sexism, which Mustafa denied. Further controversy surrounded her alleged posting to Twitter \\"KillAllWhiteMen\\" and for referring to a fellow student as \\"white trash\\". A petition was launched calling for Mustafa to be sacked; a vote of no confidence initiated by Goldsmiths' students failed to gain sufficient support to remove her from the position. The Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into Mustafa's comments; they initially charged her on two counts, but dropped proceedings after concluding that they were unlikely to secure a conviction. This police investigation attracted media attention, with commentators from across the political spectrum describing it as an affront to free speech. Amid an investigation into allegations of bullying, in November 2015 Mustafa resigned from her position at Goldsmiths. Controversy =Initial incident and response= The incident surrounded the student union at Goldsmiths (pictured) A 28-year-old from Edmonton in northeast London, Mustafa was the welfare and diversity officer of Goldsmiths Students' Union. She described herself as a \\"working class, Turkish Cypriot, queer, disabled woman and activist\\" whose political views were \\"intersectional, queer, feminist, [and] anti-racist\\". In February 2015 she was criticised by The Spectator after organising a Goldsmiths Students' Union social event and screening of Dear White People for black and minority ethnic (BME) students only, with white people being banned from attending. The Spectator stated that this event represented \\"racial segregation at a British university\\" and highlighted the double standards of holding an event from which white people were banned when a white-only event would certainly be prohibited. In April 2015, Mustafa again attracted attention while planning an event devoted to challenging the \\"white-centric culture\\" of student occupations and diversifying the student curriculum becauseon the event's Facebook pageshe asked that only women of color attend the event. In her original post she stated: :\\"Hey, I made as many of you hosts so please invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only. Don't worry lads we will give you and allies things to do.\\" The feminist scholar of creative writing Prudence Chamberlain later noted that such a situation was \\"not at all uncommon in the organisation of diversity events\\". Mustafa herself later described her events as being \\"not unlike women and black caucuses that have been a proud tradition of the trade union movement for decades\\". Mustafa's comments attracted national media attention, and generated anger from both student publications and the wider press. Many accused her of sexism, as well as racism. Speaking anonymously, the president of one student union criticised Mustafa, stating that she was contributing to a campus environment in which white, cisgender males were given the impression that \\"they can't say anything for fear of retribution\\", resulting in life becoming \\"very difficult\\" for them. The anonymous president added that it was \\"laughable\\" and ironic that Mustafa thought that her events are \\"diversifying the student community in the name of feminism and multiculturalism\\". The Spectator similarly saw irony in Mustafa's comments, stating that \\"it is astonishing\\" that a racially exclusionary event \\"is deemed acceptable. It wouldn't be tolerated anywhere else in Britain ‚Äì so why on earth is it being tolerated at a British university?\\" The Tab expressed the view that there was \\"a huge difference\\" between holding events that catered primarily to women and ethnic minority students and events which banned anyone who was not a woman or ethnic minority from attending. =Response and further controversy= Mustafa deleted the Facebook post, and responded to her critics in a video uploaded to Eastlondonlines.co.uk, in which she dismissed criticism of her actions as \\"an outrageous distortion of fact\\". Here, she stated that: :\\"There have been charges made against me that I am racist and sexist to white men. I want to explain why this is false. I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men, because racism and sexism describes structures of privilege based on race and gender. And therefore women of colour and minority genders cannot be racist or sexist because we do not stand to benefit from such a system. In order for our actions to be deemed racist or sexist, the current system would have to be one that enables only people of colour and women to benefit economically and socially on such a large scale and to the systematic exclusion of white people and men, who for the past 400 years would have to have been subjected to block colonisation. We do not live in such a system, we do not know of such a history, reverse racism and reverse sexism are not real.\\" Mustafa's justification of her actions caused more public controversy. The BBC found commentators who supported Mustafa's definition of racism as a form of structural inequality, whereas others disagreed with her, believing that anyone could be racist to those of another race and that this was a case of double standards. Further controversy surrounded her alleged posting to Twitter \\"KillAllWhiteMen\\", which was described as racist. In another tweet, made from her official Twitter account as a student union representative, she accused student activist Tom Harris of being \\"white trash\\". She later apologized, acknowledging that her use of the official account was \\"not professional\\". She told Vice that she had never tweeted \\"#KillAllWhiteMen\\", but defended those who did, saying that it \\"is something that a lot of people in the feminist community use to express frustration\\" and that it is not a literal command for androcide. She also stated that she had received rape and death threats following the media coverage. A petition was established on Change.org that called for Mustafa to be removed from her position at the union for \\"hate speech\\"; as of 23 May it had gained 18,000 signatures. Within Goldsmiths itself, a group of students petitioned for a vote of no confidence in Mustafa, but by May their petition had gained only 165 signatures, representing 1.8% of the union's membership; according to the union's regulations, 3% of members' signatures were required in order to trigger a referendum regarding Mustafa's continued employment and thus she remained in her position. Writing in The Independent, Max Benwell stated that the hashtag #KillAllWhiteMen was \\"obviously tongue-in-cheek\\" before adding that \\"no-one actually thinks that she was actually calling for a male genocide, do they?\\". =Police investigation= In May 2015, the Metropolitan Police revealed that they were investigating Mustafa's tweets. In October, they charged Mustafa with two offences, sending a threatening message and sending a menacing or offensive message via a public network. She was ordered to appear at Bromley Magistrates Court on 5 November. However, on 26 October the Metropolitan Police dropped the charges, revealing that they had discontinued their criminal case against Mustafa because there was \\"not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction\\". Under the Victim's Right to Review Scheme, one of the complainants in the case then requested that the Crown Prosecution Service review their decision to terminate criminal proceedings. Robert Sharp, a representative of the freedom of speech advocacy group English PEN, expressed the view that the police had been excessive in their dealings with Mustafa, stating his view that the fact that the case had \\"gone on so long is a chill on free speech\\". Sharp believed that advancing criminal proceedings was not in the interests of the public because Mustafa's comments were \\"clearly a joke... It was a political statement, however inadvisable it was for an elected students' union official to post it.\\" Sharp's analysis was later quoted by the academic David Harvey in his discussion of how social media technologies were influencing law-making. Praising the police's decision to terminate the charges in The Guardian, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff believed that there had been a double standard in the fact that police had investigated Mustafa for her comments but not the online trolls who had harassed her. Brinkhurst-Cuff nevertheless stated that \\"there's no denying that Mustafa has made some mistakes\\", in particular by adopting approaches \\"that many would consider extreme.\\" A commentator for The Tab concurred, commenting that although Mustafa might be \\"a bore and a killjoy\\", that \\"doesn't make [her] a criminal\\". Among those to publicly express support for Mustafa's position using Twitter were right-wing commentators Katie Hopkins and Milo Yiannopoulos. Mustafa stated that she was \\"so embarrassed\\" to receive Hopkins' support, regarding her as \\"an attention-seeking, classist idiot\\". She added that both Hopkins and Yiannopoulos were \\"not my allies‚ÄîI did not ask for their support, and I don't want it.\\" Aftermath In November 2015, Adrihani Rashid, the President of Goldsmith Students' Union, resigned from her position amid allegations that she had been bullied by Mustafa. Mustafa and Alex Etches, the union's campaigns and activities officer, were said to have created a \\"hostile\\" working environment for Rashid, undermining her and \\"badmouth[ing]\\" her to other students, as well as accusing her of acting \\"undemocratically\\" when Rashid refused to endorse solidarity statements backing student protesters and occupiers. Goldsmiths called for a full investigation into the allegations, with the union agreeing to do so. In a statement, the union stated that it \\"takes these allegations very seriously, and having raised these with the Trustee Board, will be instigating an independent inquiry\\". Amid these allegations, on 20 November Mustafa publicly stated that she was resigning from her job with the student union. She informed reporters from The Evening Standard that \\"I am resigning for the preservation of my mental and physical health. I am still committed to the independent investigation which I am confident will shed light on the structural issues that have led to the mental and physical breakdown of all sabbatical officers\\". As of November 2017, Mustafa was working as a digital youth outreach officer for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. In March 2018, Mustafa‚Äînow describing herself as \\"a communist, anti-fascist, and feminist organiser\\"‚Äîspoke out on the Munroe Bergdorf race row incident. She criticised the decision of the Labour Party to dismiss Bergdorf from her role and drew comparisons between the way she and Bergdorf had been treated by both the right-wing media and sectors of the political left.

History  Unizibira is plausibly identified with modern Henchir-Zembra, now in the Sahel region of southern Tunisia. The main archaeological remains of the town are those of a Roman amphitheatre. It was among many cities important enough in the Roman (later Byzantine) province of Byzacena, to become a suffragan diocese (Latin: dioecesis Unizibirensis or Unuzibirensis) of the Metropolitan of Carthage, in the papal sway. There are three historically documented bishops of Unizibira : *Donatist Maximinus attended the Council of Carthage (411), which saw gathered together the Catholic bishops and schismatic Donatists bishops of Roman Africa, whose heresy was condemned; there was no Catholic counterpart from Unizira. * Ciprianus participated in the Council of Carthage (484) called by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, after which he was exiled like most Catholic bishops. He is also mentioned by Victor of Vita in its history of persecution vandale. A Bishop Cyprian, remembered in the Roman Martyrology on the date of October 12, may be him.Felix Abbirita with Cyprian of Unizibira. * Donatus, who took part in the Council of 641 against the heresy Monothelitism.

Even though sand mining is banned in most parts of Kerala, it is going on secretly because of the big demand of sand in the booming construction of the state. Periyar River Sand mining is a serious threat to most of the rivers in Kerala but the case is more visible in Periyar river. The indiscriminate mining has even affected the stability of Sree Sankara Bridge at Kaladay. According to D. Padmalal, head of the Environmental Sciences Division, Ntinal Center for Earth Science Studioes, this kind of mindless mining has created big problems to the rivers of the state. Some areas of the river are turned into mud filed pits about ten meters deep and one person has recently died of falling into it. Legislation and banning The high court of Kerala has banned mining within one km radius of bridges but the state government is permitting mining even within 500 meters of the bridge. Illegal sand mining has created about 800 pits on the Periyar river. In June 2015, the government of Kerala banned mining in six rivers of Kerala for a period of three years.

Life Lonque received his first music teachings from his father, who taught the viola at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent. At the age of 11, he began his studies at this Conservatory, where he studied solf√®ge (Oscar Roels), violin (Johan Smit), chamber music (Albert Zimmer), harmony (L√©on Moeremans), counterpoint (Emile Mathieu) and fugue (Martin Lunssens). He won the Emile Mathieu prize in 1927 with his Sonate in Fis majeur for violin and piano. In 1927 and 1929, he competed in the Prix de Rome and won a second prize for his cantata Antigone. Thanks to a grant by the Belgian government Lonque was able to travel through Germany, Austria and France to study music. During these travels he met composers such as Richard Strauss, Robert Heger and Gabriel Pern√©. Lonque played the violin at the orchestra of the Royal Opera of Ghent (1914-1932). In 1935, he found the Foyer de la Musique de Chambre. He also conducted the Ghent Opera Concerts during the Second World War. Lonque worked at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent (1924-1965).

E. Williams, The Derbyshire Miners, pp.586-588 In 1912, he was employed by the Derbyshire Miners' Association (DMA) as its first clerk. While in this post, he wrote Business Methods and Accountancy in Trade Unions, which became an important text for the trade union movement, was also an active member of the Labour Party in Chesterfield, and also won a place on the union's executive. In 1928, Lynch stood for election as treasurer of the DMA against eleven other candidates, including Samuel Sales. In contrast to almost all other office- holders in mining trade unions, he never worked as a coal miner himself. He complained that, during the election, he was falsely accused of being a member of the Conservative Party and of misusing his office to circulate an election address, and he was narrowly defeated by Oliver Wright. However, when Wright died in 1938, Lynch defeated twelve other candidates, including Sales and Harold Neal, to win the post. Harry Hicken, general secretary of the DMA, resigned in 1942, and the executive posts in the union were rearranged. Lynch was appointed as the new general and financial secretary without an election being held. During his period of office, the union became the Derbyshire Area of the National Union of Mineworkers.

Bar-On is thought to be the first to introduce the concept of an ‚ÄúEQ‚Äù (‚ÄúEmotional Quotient‚Äù) to measure ‚Äúemotional and social competence‚Äù,The \\"Emotional Quotient\\" (\\"EQ\\") was described on page 419 of a copy of Reuven Bar-On‚Äôs doctoral dissertation submitted to Rhodes University in July 1985. In that it was accepted by two of the three readers and not unanimously, it was revised, resubmitted and eventually accepted. although the acronym was used earlier to describe ideas that were not associated with emotional intelligence per se.Wells, W. D. (1964). EQ, son of EQ, and the reaction profile. Journal of Marketing, 28(4), 45-52. In the first copy of his doctoral dissertation, which was submitted in 1985, Bar-On proposed a quantitative approach to creating ‚Äúan EQ analogous to an IQ score.‚Äù  Contributions to the field of emotional intelligence  Bar- On developed a conceptual and psychometric model of emotional intelligence (or ‚Äúemotional and social competence‚Äù as he originally referred to this construct in his doctoral dissertationBar-On, R. (1988). The development of a concept of psychological well-being. Doctoral dissertation, Rhodes University, South Africa.); and since 1982, has been examining the ability of this model to predict various aspects of human behavior and performance. The Bar-On model is described as one of the three major models of emotional intelligence in the Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology, although other variations of these models have surfaced over the years. =The Bar-On concept of emotional and social intelligence= Bar-On created his model of emotional and social intelligence to expand psychological assessment. The focus of his doctoral research was psychological well-being. He wanted to include a wider range of contributors to behavior and performance.Multi-Health Systems (2011). The Emotional Quotient Inventory 2.0: User‚Äôs handbook. Toronto, ON: Multi-Health Systems. While working as a clinical psychologist, he became influenced by the emerging field of positive psychology Seligman, M. E. P., & Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology. American Psychologist, 55(1), 5-14. and began shifting his interest from psychopathology to assessing and developing emotional intelligence which he argued is an integral part of positive psychology (in 2010). Bar-On's conceptual model describes an array of interrelated emotional and social competencies that determine how effective individuals are at understanding and expressing themselves, understanding others and interacting with them as well as coping with daily demands and challenges.Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., & Caruso, D. (2000). Models of emotional intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Handbook of intelligence. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, pp. 396-420.Plake, B. S., & Impara, J. C. (Eds.) (2001). Test reviews of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory. The fourteenth mental measurement yearbook. Lincoln, NE: Buros Institute for Mental Measurement.Gowing, M. K. (2001). Measurement of individual emotional competence. In C. Cherniss and D. Goleman (Eds.), The emotionally intelligent workplace: How to select for, measure, and improve emotional intelligence in individuals, groups, and organizations. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, pp. 83-131. These competencies are clustered into the following five meta-factors: (1) the ability to be aware of emotions as well as to understand and express feelings; (2) the ability to understand how others feel and interact with them; (3) the ability to manage and control emotions; (4) the ability to manage change, adapt and solve problems of a personal and interpersonal nature; and (5) the ability to generate positive affect to enhance self- motivation, in order to facilitate emotionally and socially intelligent behavior. These five meta-factors comprise a total of 15 factors. =Bar-On's measure of emotional and social intelligence= In 1982, Bar-On began developing the precursor of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory‚Ñ¢ (EQ-i‚Ñ¢), which was designed to study and assess the emotional and social competencies he identified. The specific process involved in developing this self-report measure, how it was normed and validated as well as its psychometric properties are described elsewhere in much greater detail and by the author in numerous other publications. The 1997 published version of this assessment psychometric instrument comprises 133 items clustered into 15 scales, which loaded on the five composite scales assessing the five meta-factors described above. The EQ-i‚Ñ¢ was the first measure of emotional intelligence to be published by a psychological test publisher and the first such measure to be peer-reviewed in the Mental Measurement Yearbook, which described it as valid and reliable measure of the emotional intelligence concept. According to what has been posted on the publisher's website (www.mhs.com), the EQ-i‚Ñ¢ was translated into more than 30 languages and used extensively worldwide. In addition to the self-report measure described here, a multi-rater version ‚Äì the Bar-On EQ-360‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì was developed in 2003 and also peer-reviewed in the Mental Measurement Yearbook.Spies, R. A., & Plake, B. S. (Eds.) (2005). Test reviews of the Bar-On Emotional Quotient 360. The sixteenth mental measurement yearbook. Lincoln, NE: Buros Institute for Mental Measurement. A youth version for children and adolescents ‚Äì the Bar-On EQ-i:YV‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì was developed before that in 2000, based on the Bar-On model as well. The Bar-On EQ-i:YV‚Ñ¢ was the first psychometric instrument to be published that was specifically designed to assess emotionally intelligent behavior in children and adolescents.

Lincoln, NE: Buros Institute for Mental Measurement. it was selected by a team of psychometricians at the University of Oxford as the emotional intelligence test of choice for children, and was recommended to the British Department of Education for use in schools throughout the United Kingdom.Stewart-Brown, S., & Edmunds, L. (2003). Assessing emotional competence in preschool and primary school settings: A review of instruments. Perspectives in Education, 21(4), 17-40. Bar-On's original 1997 version of the EQ-i‚Ñ¢ was revised in 2011by Multi-Health Systems; and the resultant EQ-i 2.0‚Ñ¢ was released in 2012. As is the case with other assessment instruments, the revision was conducted in an effort to avoid the language from becoming dated.Butcher, J. N. (2000). Revising psychological tests: Lessons learned from the revision of the MMPI. Psychological Assessment, 12(3), 263-271. According to the publisher's technical manual, the EQ-i 2.0‚Ñ¢ is described as a revised psychometric instrument based on the original Bar-On model. The manual reveals that the overall correlation between the EQ-i 2.0‚Ñ¢ and the original EQ-i‚Ñ¢ is .90 and that the correlations between the scales of the two versions range from .49 to .90; and based on a series of factor analyses that were conducted, the findings support, for the most part, the original 15-factor structure and the 5-meta-factor structure of the Bar-On conceptual model. =The predictive ability of the Bar-On model= Although a few scholars have questioned the construct validity of the Bar-On model,Murphy, Kevin R.

In addition to the validity studies referenced here as well as the reviews mentioned in the Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology and in the Mental Measurement Yearbook, other researchers have also concluded that the Bar-On model is a valid and reliable measure of emotional and social intelligence. Additionally, Bar-On has authored or co- authored more than 40 publications describing his model including its predictive ability and applicability; and these publications have been cited in thousands of other publications, including peer-reviewed articles and doctoral dissertations.  Academic and career background, positions and honors  For his contribution to the field of emotional intelligence, Bar-On was nominated for an Honorary Doctorate Degree by the University of Pretoria in 2006, received a Fellowship in the British Royal Society of the Arts in 2008, and was invited to present a keynote address at the 30th International Congress of Psychology.

Early life and rise to monkhood  Siwichai was born to a humble peasant family in Ban Pang. Early accounts suggest that on the particular day that he was born there was a heavy thunderstorm and rain and was thus given the name of Fuen, \\"quake\\" or Fahong, \\"thunder\\". Given the context of his birth, many around his village accredited him as the phu mee boon or a person having merit.Treesahakiat 2011, 34-35 As a child, Fahong has been described to have compassion with all beings. Previous biographies cite that as a child he would release the animals that his father caught for cooking or beg him to not hit fish as their heads would hurt.Treesahakiat 2011, 35 From an early age Fehong expressed a serious interest in Buddhism as the believed that his family's present state of poverty was a consequence of his misbehavior in his previous life and became a well behaved monk so his parents would have a better life. He was ordained as a novice (samanen) at the age of 18 at the local temple in the village of Ban Pang. Fahong was ordained as a monk in 1899 at Wat Ban Hong Luang at which point the took a religious name of Phra Siwichai Treesahakiat 2011, 37 and went on to study with his first teacher Khruba Khattiya in Wat Bang Pan. As a student the Khruba was known to have great respect and reverence towards the science of magic and spells. Additionally, Khruba Siwichai gained reputation for his asceticism Traditional accounts of his early career suggest Khruba Siwichai was an exemplary Buddhist monk, eating only one vegetarian meal a day and refraining from \\"habit-forming practices as chewing betel and fermented tea leaves, and smoking\\".Swearer 2005, 79 His generosity and compassion were evident to everyone around him. One of his biographers Sanga Suphapha said the following: :He showed compassion and mercy towards anyone who appealed to him ... he did nothing that was useful to himself. He was not a monk of rank, but only a monk of the people ... As a result he was always moving about, doing useful things wherever he went ... They were things that led Buddhists to rejoice that a monk with the wide heart of a Bodhisattva had been born into the world.Cohen 2001, 228  Temple constructions  Khruba Siwichai became the new abbot of Wat Ban Pang after the former abbot, Khruba Khattiya, passed away.Treesahakiat 2011, 37 Soon after, he began building a new temple and finished it in 1904, naming it Wat Sri Don Chai Sai Mun Bun Rueng even though villagers still referred to it as a Wat Ban Pang.Treesahakiat 2011, 38 This new temple was but the beginning of a career involving the repair and construction of over one hundred religious and nonreligious projects such as temples, roads, and bridges. Some of his more renowned monuments were temples on the top of Doi Suthep, the Suan Dork temple in Chiang Mai and the reliquary at the Camthewi temple in Lamphun.Cohen 2001, 228 Villagers were urged to donate their money and labor as an act of merit (bun). Nationally known Buddhist monk and writer Phikkhu Panyanantha described Khruba Siwichai as a monk not of rank, but of the people and gained massive popular support and the status of a ton bun (holy men).Treesahakiat 2011, 47 A highly respected northern Thai monk writes: > Khruba Siwichai had done many good deeds to Buddhism. His goodness could > hardly fade away from northern people' minds and especially for his many > construction and renovation works. It seems that there were no other monks > in this region who had done such thing like Khruba Siwichai.Treesahakiat > 2011, 41 The Khruba's charismatic, and often rebellious, personality increased his reputation and influence. Many began to ascribe the title of bodhisatta with miraculous powers.Swearer 2005, 72 Early biographies report that the renovated Wat Phra Singha temple was constructed with the help of angels as the workers who were constructing the temple found pots full of gold.Treesahakiat 2011, 44 Other accounts suggest that when working in any weather conditions they did not get hot or wet. Khruba consistently denied having these special powers, but his public ascription as a bodhisatta remained.  Conflict with local and national authorities  Khruba Siwichai came into serious conflict with the sangha, the authorities of the national order of monks, and the Siamese state. The Sangha Act of 1902 stipulated that monk ordinations by any senior monk required the permission of his respective sangha superior and of the District Officer. Khruba Siwichai had ordained monks and novices without been officially recognized as a \\"preceptor of the Thai hierarchy\\" leading to his confinement in a temple in Lamphun in about 1915-1916.Keyes 1971, 557 Siwichai's perceived ignorance and disregard for the law led to his years of imprisonment. While most of the scholarship centers on that charge as the source of Siwichai's conflict, available evidence may complicate this issue. Firstly, Siwichai may have been fully aware and willing to comply with the law. Apparently, two officials within the central Thai administration, the kromakarn which represented the Religious Affairs Department and the naaj amphur who worked on behalf of the Ministry of Interior, denied Siwichai's request to appoint the monks. A detailed account in the Bangkok Times Weekly Mail describes the situation: :About five years ago the [Siwichai] proposed to ordain a new priest, and the sent the Kamnan [subdistrict head] and head-man of the village to ask for a license from the Kromakarn and Nai Amphur. They were told that the license would be issued later, and that meantime they could be preparing for the ceremony. The priest did make the preparations - a Buat Nak [ordination ceremony] costs some money - and when it was near lent, the again sent the Kamnan and Phu Yai Ban [village headman] to get the promised license. This time it was definitely refused. Taking the view that there was nothing wrong in ordaining an honest man, the priest carried out the rite without a license.Bowie 2014, 715 Siwichai was indeed the Abbot of his village temple at the time and the head of the temple in his subdistrict. Having held the title of priesthood for more than ten years, it is likely that he would have been in good standing to conduct and approve his own ordinations. It is much more plausible that the secular officials may have denied approval of the monks that were to be ordained due to certain clauses in the 1913 Ordination act. The act lists punishments for monks who ordained \\"forbidden\\" men which may have ranged from people pending court cases, evading taxes, or people simply fleeing taxes or military service.Bowie 2014, 716 Furious over Siwichai's insubordination, he was arrested by the police and brought to the Wat Lii Luang temple where the district prelate Phrakhru Maharatnkhon resided. However, he was quickly sent to the temple of Lapmhun out of fear of the growing following that had gathered over the last four days in front of Wat Lii Luang. He was released soon after in Lamphun. Siwichai was arrested again a year after his initial imprisonment. The district prelate ordered all monks and novices under his jurisdiction to meet in order to certify that the religious leaders were acting in accord with all regulations. Once Siwichai decided not to go, the rest of the monks decided to not go as well.Premchit 2000, 33 Consequently, Siwichai was arrested once again and brought to the prelate in Lamphun. A committee was appointed by the provincial prelate and decided to forbid Siwichai to perform his duties as an ordainer and was demoted from his role as an abbot and subdistrict head. Siwichai was thus imprisoned for one year at Wat Phrathat Haripunchai in the city of Lamphun and returned to his temple in Baang Pang. This time, however, without the title of abbot and subdistrict head. Siwichai was consequently banned from Lamphun in January 1918.Premchit 2000, 37 However, he refused to leave and in 1920 was invited by the lord (chao) of Lamphun to receive the alms of the city. On his Journey to Lamphun, then was followed by nearly 600 men and women, leading the officials to think that the \\"priest had come to create a revolt\\" and was, once again, arrested in Waluang.Bowie 2014, 716 This was brought to the attention of the Supreme Patriarch (sangharaja) in Bangkok who formed a committee in order to investigate the eight charges brought against Siwichai. The committee concluded ruled that the punishment of imprisonment for the ordination of monks should have come from Bangkok and that Siwichai's failure to attend the meetings were too severe.Bowie 2014, 717 The supreme patriarch sent him home and even contributed funds to help the costs of his journey back.Bowie 2014, 717 In this sense, it is apparent that the Bangkok sangha recognized many of Siwichai's actions and his refusal to cooperate with many of the local secular officials.  Death and influence  The Khruba died near the age of 61 in his home village at Wat Ban Pang on 21 February 1939. He died out of exhaustion and sickness which were largely influenced by a long battle with hemorrhoids.Treesahakiat 2011, 50 His body was cremated in 1946. Early accounts record that in the day of his cremation the sky became suddenly dark with heavy unexpected rain although it was not rainy season.Treesahakiat 2011, 50 Today, the Wat Ban Pang temple serves as a museum for the late Khruba, built by one of his original biographers Phra Anan Phutthathammo in June 1989.TreesahakiatIsara 2011, 115 The museum's entrance is protected by two statues of a Tiger from Khruba Siwichai's birth year. By the staircase, a small shrine has been placed for monks and others to worship Khruba Siwichai and recite his prayers. The museum features collections of paraphernalia associated with his various construction projects including maps, a bench for resting, and a carrier bicycle.TreesahakiatIsara 2011, 115 Additionally, the most notable temples that the Khruba built contain shrines built in his honor. For instance, the temple of Wat Phra Singha contains a shrine of Khruba Siwichai and features a long bronze statue of him, standing, in front of the \\"vihara\\". Similar bronze statues can be seen in the Wat Suan Dok temple and at the hilltop of Doi Suthep.TreesahakiatIsara 2011, 110 References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= *Bowie, Katherine. \\"The Saint with Indra's Sword: Khruubaa Srivichai and Buddhist Millenarianism in Northern Thailand.\\" Comp Stud Soc Hist Comparative Studies in Society and History 56.03 (2014): 681-713 *Cohen, Paul T. \\"Buddhism Unshackled: The Yuan 'Holy Man' Tradition and the Nation- State in the Tai World.\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 32, no. 2 (June 2001): 227-247. *Keyes, Charles F. \\"Death of Two Buddhist Saints in Thailand.\\" In Charisma and Sacred Biography, edited by Michael A.

Originally conceived the facility was built to house up to 300 young boys but by 1852 an addition was added to house an additional 300 inmates. By 1857, there were 614 inmates at the reform school. After a devastating fire in 1859, that consumed half of the building and was set by one of the inmates, the school created a nautical branch to house some of the older boys on school ships. The youngest boys were housed in an old mill in the nearby village while some remained in what was left of the Reform School. By 1861 what was left of the Reform School was rebuilt and 3 \\"trust houses\\" were built, each holding approximately 30 boys. The \\"trust houses\\" as an experiment in juvenile reform in which boys were placed in a family setting known as the \\"cottage system\\". By 1872, the nautical branch was disbanded and in 1877 a \\"correctional\\" addition was added to the original building to house the older boys. After a riot broke out in 1877, information leaked to the media about cruel and unnecessarily severe punishment of the boys. Legislative hearings were held and the abuses uncovered were denounced by many in the public. By 1880 the legislature, having deemed the Reform School a failed experiment in a congregate setting, and needing additional space for an overcrowded institutional system for the insane, used the land and the buildings to establish the Westborough Insane Hospital. By 1884, the State Reform School for Boys was relocated a couple of miles away, in Westborough, and renamed the Lyman School for Boys being established under the \\"cottage system\\". It is widely written that the Reform School for Boys in Westborough was the first juvenile reform school to be built in the United States. This is somewhat misleading as there were several reform schools built before 1848 including; The Boston Farm School (1833) and the New York House of Refuge (1824) that were either private or corporate institutions. The State Reform School for Boys in Westborough is believed to be the oldest publicly funded reform school in the United States.  Juvenile reform school movement  The reform movement for juveniles began in the United States in 1824 with the founding of the House of Refuge in New York City. In 1826, the Philadelphia House of Refuge was built, and in 1827 the House of Reformation for juvenile offenders in Boston was established. These early attempts at reforming child criminals were spawned from work previously done in England and of the Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline and for the Reformation of Juvenile Offenders (1815). In New York, the Society for the Prevention of Pauperism was established in (1818) later reorganized as The Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents (1823). These organizations were founded on the principals that children under the age of 17, convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment, should not be put in jail among older hardened criminals. They should be reformed of their criminal ways by moral, religious, academic and vocational education in a setting more resembling a home environment than a prison environment.  Massachusetts vision 1846‚Äì47  Early in 1846, a petition from magistrates and citizens of the Commonwealth was brought before the General Court asking for the creation of a state institution for the reformation of juvenile offenders. A committee was appointed to consider the matter and on February 20, 1846, a circular was issued containing 9 questions regarding the formation of a reform school.The commissioners circular as it appeared in 1848 The answers received from the citizens convinced the committee of the need for such an institution. April 16, 1846, the governor was authorized to appoint 3 commissioners to purchase land, erect a building and establish a system of governance for the first public institution of its kind. Theodore Lyman ll, former governor of Boston, answered the committees circular.Theodore Lyman's response to the commissions circular in 1848 Mr. Lyman was particularly interested in the subject of a State Reform School, having been president of the board of managers of the Farm School at Thompson's Island. Mr. Lyman donated $30,000 for the purposes of purchasing land and erecting a building for the purpose. Later in his will, he would donate an additional $20,000.Extracts from Theodore Lyman's Will In 1847, the commissioners purchased the farm of Lovett Peters in Westborough containing 180 acres situated on the north side of Chauncy Lake for $9000. Soon after, the farm and land across the road was purchased by the Trustees for $3500. Shortly after opening the school and additional 23 acres was purchased, west of the main building from the Warren Farm for a total of 280 acres. On June 15, 1847, the contract for the building was given to the lowest bidder, Mr Daniel Davies of Boston, for $52,000 with a stipulation that the contract completion date would be December 1848. On that same day, the commissioners selected the location, on the 180-acre old Peters Farm, where the building would be erected. The institution was built to accommodate 300 students, with apartments for the superintendent and his family; rooms for other persons employed; a chapel; hospital, offices, 7 \\"solitaire dormitories\\" for disciplined, school rooms, workshops and sleeping dormitories. The foundations of the building were built with stones, the walls were brick and the roof was slated.The basement floor plans of the original buildingsThe 1st and 2nd Floor Plan of the original building  Governing structure  Legislature * The Legislature would appropriate yearly budgets for the institution, appropriate special budgets and pass general laws regarding the reform school based upon recommendations of the Trustees and Superintendent.

Early years 1848‚Äì59  Superintendents: * William R. Lincoln (1848‚Äì53) * James M. Talcott (1853‚Äì57) * William E. Starr (1857‚Äì61) The early years were marked by rapid expansion and an ever-evolving inmate governance. The practical workings of the institution were founded on the daily participation of the inmates in education, industrious or agricultural work, religious teachings, and preparing them for an apprenticeship with minimal time for recreation or idol time. The washing, ironing, and cooking were done by the boys as well as making and mending their own clothes. The farm was to be a centerpiece of the work experience at the Reform School. It was thought that young boys would prosper from the knowledge and physical labor of working on the farm. Additionally, it was hoped that a well-managed farm with good soil and abundant free labor could help defray the cost of the Reform School. At the time of admittance, the boys were classified by age, temperance, education level and physical abilities. This fundamental classification system would allow for grouping of boys in the dormitories by age, in the classroom by prior education levels, and for working in groups, temperance, and physical abilities would be considered. Additionally, a grading system for conduct was adopted consisting of 4 grades designated as 1 through 4. When a boy was admitted he was placed in the third grade and overtime if his conduct was bad he was degraded, as a punishment, to the 4th; if his conduct was good he was promoted to the second. The first grade had a subdivision called \\"truth and honor\\" which was the highest rank available. This system was applied to their conduct while in the schoolroom, in the shop, on the playground or on the farm. For punishment, they were degraded from a higher to lower rank and for encouragement promoted from a lower to higher rank. Many privileges were granted for good conduct including excursions on the lake in a boat in summer or sledding and skating in winter. A grading system, for the School Department, was used by dividing the students into four grades designated 1 through 4. First grade was for beginners in reading and taught basic reading. The second grade was for students who could read easy words and they primarily studied reading and spelling. The third grade was for students who could read ordinary passages; they were taught reading, spelling, arithmetic and geography. The 4th grade was for students who could read and spell well in class and they studied arithmetic geography and grammar. These classification and grading systems would evolve over time as the Reform School changed and best practices were better understood. The typical day for an inmate would start at 5 a.m.. After attending to their morning duties they would attend the religious exercise of the morning. Breakfast would be served from 6 to 7 a.m.; labor from 7 to 10 a.m.; and school from 10 to 12 a.m.. Lunch and play was reserved from 12 to 1 p.m.; work from 1 to 4 p.m. and supper and play from 4 to 5 p.m.. Schooling would take place from 5 to 7 p.m. From 7 p.m. to bedtime was used for examination of the days misdemeanors; moral instruction and devotional exercises.left The labor of the boys was divided into three categories farming, mechanical and domestic. Farming included labor on the farm and garden, labor in the gardens of the neighbors, and all of other outdoor laborers around the building. It also included hauling coal from the train station, two and a half miles away in the village of Westborough. After the new tracks of the Agricultural Branch Railroad were opened to Northborough in 1855, the coal was hauled from the State Farm Station about 1 mile from the institution. The mechanical employment included working in the shoe-making shop and in the sewing and knitting shop. The domestic employment included ironing and washing, baking and cooking, scrubbing and the miscellaneous work inside the building. The original building was designed to accommodate two separate workshops for the purpose of teaching the boys a mechanical skill as well as creating commodities of value that could be sold. These workshops were not originally fitted up with tooling for any particular trade as this decision was deferred until the institution was up and running. After much deliberation in 1849, it was decided that they would have a shoe shop and a sewing and knitting shop the latter would be run by the matron and the former would be overseen by a person proficient in the trade of making and repairing shoes in boots. The smallest boys were typically placed in the sewing shop where they work daily on making all the necessary clothing for 300 boys as well as all the bedding, bed ticks, towels, pillows, curtains, aprons and the like. The larger boys were taught in the shoe shop to manufacture shoes and close both shoes and boots. These were made not only for the boys in the institution but they were also sold.The number of boys working at varies duties in 1849 By 1852, the State Reform School was contracting the shoe shop work out to a local business. A contract would be made with a shoe manufacturer and they would provide all the material and oversight. The reform school would provide the workshop and the labor of the boys. The shoe manufacturer would pay the State .10c per boy per day. The boys would make nothing off this arrangement. By 1855, the business of shoe making was all but suspended due to a decline in demand for shoes and boots. Additionally, the labor for the sewing and knitting shop was decreased as well. These boys were put to other light work instead of being left idle. In 1856, a chair seating department was added. For the year 111 boys worked here producing 27,000 seat and 2100 backs. = Building Addition 1853 = As seen from 1853 to 1859In March 1852, the legislature approved expenditures for the enlargement of the state reform school from 300 to 600 inmates. At that time the board of trustees were authorized to direct the erection of the building and by June of that year construction commenced. The new edition was dedicated on November 3, 1853, with a dedication speech from Nathaniel P Banks in the presence of a large company distinguished guests and residents of Westborough and its vicinity. The new addition measures to 225 feet on the front and rear and 200 feet on the east end. It has a chapel to accommodate 600 boys, large school rooms, a well arranged hospital department and accommodations for the officers and assistants necessary for the care and instruction of 300 boys. This addition was completed at a cost of $54,000. By the end of September in 1856, there were 614 inmates in the State Reform School. The chapel was completed along with the addition of 1853. Conveniently located between the original building and the new addition it was easily accessed from either department. It was large enough to accommodate 600 boys with a balcony area. The chapel was heated by a furnace, it was well ventilated and lighted with large windows supplied with blinds and furnished with comfortable settees. The chapel was used for the morning devotional exercises, for the Sunday school and worshiping. Every Sunday the reform school would send a carriage to the village of Westborough to transport chaplains from different churches and faith to help conduct Sunday school at the chapel. During the reconstruction of the chapel, after the fire of 1859, 14 cells were installed in the basement for the detainment and discipline the boys for their offenses. This area was known as the lodge. The third department was an area of the new building created to house the more hardened, boys segregated and isolated from the others. The third department consisted of 20 cells (lodges) and a workshop. The boys in the third department would work 8 hours a day in the workshop and for the rest of the day and night would be spent in their \\"lodge\\" where they would eat, read and sleep except twice a day they would be taken to the yard when no other boys were present. The discipline in this department was stricter than the other departments but the food was the same as the other boys are fed. Time spent in the lodge was determined by the individual boys behavior. = Agricultural experiment 1854‚Äì59 = Artist rendering of the Reform School showing the farm barn and agricultural landscape At a meeting of the State Board of Agriculture held on May 12, 1853, a committee was formed to determine if the Board of agriculture could conveniently use the farm at the State Reform School for scientific experiments in the cultivation of the soil and in the raising of livestock. The committee, after referring to the governor, reported favorably to a leasing arrangement with the board of trustees of the Reform School. The purpose of the arrangement as stated in the agreement was too: > Relieve the trustees of the state reform school of the care and management > of the agricultural portion of the establishment at Westborough, to provide > an experimental farm for the Board of Agriculture, and to purchase greater > facilities for the employment and instruction of the inmates of the reform > school in agriculture and horticulture‚Ä¶ while the products of the farm shall > continue to be applied for the use of the school substantially as they were > while the farm was under the immediate control of the board of trustees. By an act of the legislature of February 27, 1854, an agreement between the board of trustees of the state reform school and the Department of Agriculture for the transfer of all operations of the farm to the Department of Agriculture for 5 years was approved. On April 1, 1854 all land associated with the State Reform School, with the exception the main building and its immediate vicinity; livestock, produce and farming utensils were transferred. The agreement stipulated that all child labor used on the farm would be payable to the institution at a rate of $0.10 a day for each boy. All milk, vegetables, beef, pork and other produce supplied to the institution would be charged at the usual prices in the neighborhood. All improvements made to the farm and land by the Department of Agriculture would not be billed. In 1855, the agreement was modified to specify that 150 boys would be employed on the farm each workday during the season. In the first couple of years of the management of the farm the boys were primarily used for permanent improvements to the farm, that were desperately needed. By 1857 200 boys a day was employed on the farm and they were instructed in the details of practical farming.left The daily work of the boys would include removing stones, building stone walls, trenching the gardens and hauling coal from the train station in the village of Westborough. In 1855, a large reservoir was required for the waste disposal of the institution. Periodically this reservoir would be drained and the solids would be removed and made into liquid fertilizer to be spread on the hay field. Over the five years, the boys would be involved in creating gravel walkways, setting apple and pear trees as well as the daily chores in the operations of the gardens and livestock. During this period, the Department of Agriculture paid for and built a, combination piggery, slaughterhouse and store house; a grainery and sheds. The piggery gained negative attention in the farming community for its perceived extravagance expense. Over the five-years the Board of Agriculture had management, the capacity of the farm was increased considerably. Produce, milk, pork and beef output were all increased with a recommendation of purchasing additional dairy cattle. It was found, however, that over this five-years the expenses of running the farm were greater than would be considered normal for a regular farm because of the use and instruction of child labor. In 1864 the farm was declared, by the Board of State Charities, to be too large to be profitable and always was a financial burden to the institution.Inventory of farm equipment in 1857 = Cemetery 1858 = In 1858, a cemetery at the Reform School was laid out and graded. A receiving tomb was constructed and a gravel walk was laid around the lot. This cemetery would be used from 1858 to 1884 to bury boys who died while in state custody and were not claimed by parents or relatives. Prior to burial, a service was held in the chapel with boys from the reform school present. After the service, the coffin would be loaded on a wagon and transported to the cemetery some distance from the main building.The coffins were bought by the State and line item-ed in the annual treasure's report. Over the 36-year history of this institution, there were approximately 75 boys that died there. It is unknown, how many of those, were buried on site. Although the institution opened some 10 years earlier, it is unclear what the school did with their dead during that time. After the reform school transferred its land and buildings to the state mental hospital, it is unclear what became of the original cemetery. The exact location of the cemetery was never recounted although there are some entries in the Annual Reports that give insight into its location.The annual reports recounts the work that was done on the cemetery over the years. The investigative report of 1877 recounts the cemetery as being 1/4 mile from the main building. = Fire 1859 = On August 13, 1859, influenced by 5 other boys, Daniel Credan set fire to a wooden ventilating flue in the new addition of the school. The fire quickly spread through the ventilation system to the attic, where the dry wood and open space allowed the flames to quickly spread throughout the structure. The officers, boys and fire departments from neighboring towns worked to put out the fire, but not until three-quarters of the institution was destroyed, including the new addition minus the chapel, which was heavily damaged. At the time of the fire, there were approximately 572 boys housed there. In the days after the fire, it was determined that what remaining portion of the school was only capable of housing 300 boys. As a temporary measure, 240 were sent to the new jail in Fitchburg and about 26 of the less trustworthy boys were sent to the Concord jail. While the legislature was deciding what the future of the reform school should be, it was necessary to make other arrangements for the housing of the boys. After much consideration by the board of trustees and in consolation with the Governor, a large building in the town of Westborough was leased and set it up to house 150 of the younger boys.The temporary housing of the younger boys in Westborough was referred to as the nursery. Additionally the remaining building would be repaired to house the remaining boys. In September 1859, then Governor Nathaniel P. Banks, address the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the destruction of the Westborough Reform School. The governor recommended that the remaining structure should be repaired to accommodate no more than 200 boys and that the family cottage system should be implemented. Additionally a Nautical Branch should be created for the older boys to instruct them in the duties of being seaman. The legislature formed a committee chaired by Martin Brimmer of Boston to take up the matter and on October 12, 1859, the committee's report was forwarded endorsing the governor's positionMartin Brimmer was the son of the 9th Mayor of Boston Martin Brimmer In the months after the fire little changed in the day-to-day operations of the institution. The farm recently being transferred back to the board of trustees provided work for a good number of boys during the summer months. Two contracts were signed, one for chair seating and one for shoe making allowing for productive work to continue in the workshops. During this time the Sunday school services were held at the Town Hall in Westborough due to the extensive damage to the chapel. Most of the services were conducted by clergy and devoted women in the town of Westborough for the boys of the main building as well as the nursery.  Reorganization to the cottage system 1860‚Äì72  State Reform School as seen 1860‚Äì77Superintendents: * William E. Starr (1857‚Äì61) * Joseph A. Allen (1861‚Äì67) * Orville K. Hutchinson (1867‚Äì68) * Benjamin Evans (1868‚Äì73) * Allen G. Shepard (1874‚Äì78) With the destruction of three-quarters of the building by fire in 1859, the legislature had the task of deciding what to do with the reform school. With the recommendations of the Governor and of a committee formed, the legislature in 1860 appropriated money to build 3 houses and make renovations to the remaining structure as deemed necessary for a new classification system. Additionally, some laws were added to address better governance of the institution as requested by the Trustees. In the spring of 1860, the legislature approved $30,000 to renovate two existing farmhouses and build one new house, rebuild the chapel and to alter the old building to provide cautions against fire. On October 11, 1860, a dedication ceremony was held in the chapel with 333 boys in attendance. After a dedicatory prayer by the Reverend A.A. Arnold of Westborough, President Felton spoke. The new system would have all boys, upon committal to the reform school, housed in the old building. Using a credit system for good behavior a boy could earn his way into one of the trust houses. In this way boys that were good candidates for reforming, in a family setting, were transferred to the trust houses and the older more harden boys were kept in the older building and separated according to class. In that same year, the Legislature authorized the formation of the Nautical Branch of the reform school with the purchase of a school ship. It was thought that the older incorrigible juveniles, that were prone to violence, could be completely separated from the reform school but not be committed to the prison system. Additionally, it was thought that this class of boys would make good seamen for commercial and naval sailing vessels. The Legislature also passed a law that year reducing the maximum commitment age from 16 to 14 years old. This was in keeping with the general thought that boys over the age of 14 were less likely to be reformed. They also abolishment of the alternative sentence. The alternative sentence was handed down by the judge at the time of sentencing and was designed to specify a sentence to prison if the boy was incorrigible at the reform school. In practice, however, it was found that in most cases the alternative sentence to prison was of a lesser duration than the reform school, sometimes amounting to only days. Because of this, some boys would act out at the reform school hoping for their alternative sentence to be enacted and for their sentence to be carried out in prison for a few days or weeks instead of the sentence to the reform school throughout their childhood.left Also enacted was an order that every sentence, to the reform school would be until the age of 18; previously it was 21. At the time, it was thought that the reform process should take upwards to 4 years to thoroughly educate the boys in character, schooling, industry, and labor. Additionally the power to commit inmates was restricted to judges of the Superior and probate courts, and all boys should have legal representation in court provided by the state. It was thought that by limiting the number of judges able to commit boys to the state reform school the number of boys committed for minor offenses would be reduced. In 1864, the legislature created an agency which they named the Board of State Charities. Its purpose was to make recommendations regarding the management of all of the State prisons, Reform Schools and Almshouses in the State. It was also charged with coordinating transfers between institutions and also managing the indenture of youth in the system. In 1866 and Visiting Agency was incorporated into the Board of State Charities to follow up and visit the indentured. Prior to the establishment of the Visiting Agency, very little information was gathered and kept on those indentured. The children indentured from the State Reform School from 1848 to 1863 was 1283.Discharge statistics of the State Reform School for 1848‚Äì1863 Approximately half of that number, the master never wrote the board of trustees as to the well-being of their apprentice as required by their contract. It was hoped that the Visiting Agent could keep tabs on the indentured children and follow their progress. = Nautical branch = In 1856, the legislature explored the idea of having a reform school on board a sailing vessel as a means of training an older class of juvenile boys to be seamen. This idea was implemented in 1856 in Liverpool, England, with the naval vessel Akbar. This early idea would not gain much traction in the legislature until the fire of 1859 which destroyed three-quarters of the state reform school and created the conditions to revisit the idea. Once enacted a board of three commissioners was appointed to carry out the plan. Reform school ship Massachusetts In December 1859 they purchase the ship Rockall making alterations to use it as a reform school for 200 boys and christened it the Massachusetts. Soon after the commissioners purchased a schooner the Wave and on June 5, 1860, dedicated both as the nautical branch of the state reform school. On July 26, 1860, 50 boys were transferred from the state reform school to the nautical branch. The first station for the Massachusetts was in Boston Harbor but it was soon changed to Salem by the governor in December 1860. In 1861, the Massachusetts was fitted out with four guns and was used as a guard ship for merchant vessels in Boston Harbor. In 1862 the Wave was declared useless and was sold. In 1865, it was found necessary to acquire another ship, the Massachusetts being found inadequate to accommodate all the boys available. The trustees were authorized to purchase a second ship larger in size than the Massachusetts. Once purchased this ship was named the George M. Barnard and was commissioned in February 1866. In that same year the Massachusetts was permanently moved to New Bedford where it would remain. In 1867, the legislature severed ties between the nautical branch and the state reform school and the school ships became independent institutions and were titled the Massachusetts Nautical School. Life for the boys aboard the ship involved learning navigation, general education, and working about the ship. The boys were divided into two watches; when one watch was in school the other watch would be doing the work that sailors must do. Starting in 1862, judge Thomas Russell was accustomed to taking trips to the George M. Bernard in Boston Harbor on Sundays to address the boys.Additional information on Judge Thomas Russell He would frequently invite gentlemen and ladies to accompany him. Among the distinguished guests were: Charles Dickens, Goldwin Smith, David Farragut, Oliver Howard, John Andrew, Joseph Hawley, William Claflin, Marshall Jewel, and Lucius Fairchild, Matthew Simpson Frederic Huntington, Edward Taylor and George Haskins,More on Father Haskins Charles Sumner, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and Anna Dickinson. Thomas Russell also served as host when on June 23, 1867 President Andrew Johnson made a visit to the school ship in Boston Harbor. left In the 12 years the nautical branch was run, there were 2062 committed and 140 more transferred from the state reform school. The average age of the boys committed was 13.5 and the average time spent on the ship was between 10 and 18 months. Over this period, the average cost per student was twice the average cost per student at the state reform school. Besides their general educational studies and work on the ship, it was very difficult to find suitable work and there was little opportunity to do anything else. It was found that classification of the boys was impossible and, therefore, viscous and comparatively good boys were crowded together. The system as a whole wasn't suitable for the reformation of the boys. The legislature in 1870 ordered the discontinuance of one school ship and in 1872 ordered that the nautical school be discontinued entirely. The State of New York followed Massachusetts in 1869 with a similar experiment, with the purchase of the school ship Mercury.More on the school ship \\"Mercury\\" = Family cottages = The progressive thought of juvenile Reform, in England, in the 1830s was to place 1 to 3 dozen inmates with similar characteristics in separate small houses under the supervision of a surrogate father or mother. The \\"family\\" thus created was to work, live, and attend school together, mixing only rarely with the inmates placed in other families. This was a radical departure from \\"congregate system\\" that the State Reform School for boys was founded on. The congregate system is a prison-like facility for housing delinquents in large dormitory areas, bringing them together under strict routines in classrooms, workshops, cafeterias and recreational areas. The main disadvantage of the congregate system is the older, more vicious boys are housed with the younger, more impressionable boys. This disadvantage is overcome with the cottage system.The cottage system is also known as the \\"family system\\". The individual buildings were usually referred to as cottages or houses. In Westborough the houses were referred to as \\"Trust Houses\\", with each house having its own name. In the late 1830s, the Colonie de Mettray in France was built on the cottage system. In the United States, the cottage system was slow to catch on because of the greater expense of land, buildings, and services required, and the supposed increase difficulty of control of the inmates. Eventually, it was introduced with the opening of the Industrial School for Girls in Lancaster Massachusetts (1854) and the Ohio Reform School (1857) which was modeled after the Colonie de Mettray. Dining room in \\"Peter House\\" (1871) left By an act of the legislature in 1860, three Trust Houses were to be constructed on the school grounds at Westborough. One would be named the \\"Farmhouse\\" the second the \\"Peter's House\\" and the third would be named the \\"Garden House\\". The farmhouse was an existing structure pre-dating the reform school. It would be renovated to house 30 boys, a master and matron.Each house is under the charge of a gentleman and his wife who have control and management of the boys, subject to the general rules of the institution, and subordinate to the superintendent. The Peter's house was also an existing structure pre-dating the reform school. It was the home of the original owner of the property. It to was renovated to house 30 boys, a master and a matron. The garden house was a new building built on the ruins of the reform school section destroyed by fire. This was a brick structure intended to house 30 boys with a master and matron. The daily lives of the boys in the trust houses was intended to be like a large family. The boys, along with the master and matron, would set at the same table to eat their daily meals, which were prepared by the boys under the supervision of the matron. The chores of the house would all be done by the boys. The boys would be schooled by the master in one room of the house. Being employed mostly on the farm they could run away at any time if they so chose, but few of them did. Discipline was more parental in nature there being no physical restraints or confinement. After the first year of the trial, the trustees were so convinced of the benefits of the cottage system that they recommended to the legislature that two more homes be built and the number of boys housed in each be reduced to 20. The trust houses would remain as the central focus of reforming the younger boys throughout the remaining years of the institution. When the Reform School for Boys closed in 1884 the newly formed Lyman School for Boys was recreated under the cottage system.  Final years 1873‚Äì84  State Reform School 1877‚Äì84 Superintendent: * Allen G. Shepard (1873‚Äì78) * Luther H. Sheldon (1879‚Äì80) * Edmond T. Dooley (1880‚Äì81) * Joseph A. Allen (1881‚Äì85) Change was a constant theme throughout the years, and it was no different in the final years. Discipline, rewards, work, classification of the boys and overall management of the institution continued to change trying to adapt to the times, philosophies of the changing superintendents and legislative laws. As a result, of the abolishment of the Nautical Branch, it was necessary to find a place to house not only those older boys that had been previously on the school ships but also future commitments of boys of that class. Despite the recommendations of the board of trustees and the superintendent, in 1870, the legislature once again changed the minimum age of commitment at the reform school from 14 to 17 allowing for the older class of boys to be committed there. Also that year, the legislature pass provisions allowing the visiting agent to work with the courts to identify suitable boys to indenture directly from the courts without being committed to the reform school first. This would lessen the amount of younger boys committed to the reform school while making additional room for the older incorrigible boys. As a consequence of these two legislative acts there were not enough young qualified boys committed, to fill the trust houses and the quantity of older incorrigible boys increased. Work for the older boys changed as well. They could not be trusted to work on the farm, without escaping, so their only means of labor was in the workshop seating chairs. The trustees thought these boys should be taught some industrial trades, but the legislature failed to appropriate money to build additional workshops, buy the machinery and hire overseers necessary to implement it. What occurred, because of these changes, was a total change in the character of the institution. It went from a place of reformation for young offenders to a place for housing older incorrigible offenders with a building and officers who were ill-equipped to deal with it. With the abolishment of the nautical branch, the trustees and superintendent sought relief from the legislature, asking that the older boys be sent elsewhere or money appropriated to build an addition to house and segregate the incorrigible ones. The legislature responded with small Appropriations enough to make minor Improvement in the security of the existing building. Then in 1875, the legislature passed appropriation of $90,000 for an addition to the school as a Correctional Department. The next year, when completed, the addition would have two large schoolrooms, sleeping halls and a dining room for about 200 boys. It would also have workshops, cells for solitary confinement, a hospital and room for the officers. Once the new addition was completed and occupied in April 1877 a series of mechanical trades were introduced including sleigh making, blacksmithing, painting, and woodworking, including making handcarts, wheelbarrows and hand sleds. With this new addition, the older incorrigible boys were able to be completely segregated from the other boys. Throughout the 1870s, a number of organizations were established to benefit the boys with good conduct. One of these was the \\"Tried and True\\" class. In order to be a member, a boy would have to be voted in, based upon his overall good conduct over a period of time. The members would wear nickel-plated badges with the words tried-and-true and had privileges such as visiting neighboring villages unattended. During this time, the \\"Band of Hope\\" was formed complete with uniforms and instruments in which the boys would play at the school and in parades in the area villages. Two Baseball clubs were organized and uniforms were provided. One of the teams called the \\"Lyman\\", visiting several places in the state and playing with other clubs. A \\"Fire Company\\" was formed and uniforms were given to the boys who were admitted. The fire company would respond to alarms of fires outside of the institution's grounds. The fire company along with their horse-drawn, hand pumper, fire engine built by Hunneman Co of Boston would test their engine with the fire department in Westborough.Information of the Hunneman hand drawn pumper. Video of the operation of a hand pumper. A military company called \\"Lyman Cadets\\" was formed, composed of 60 boys completely furnished with uniforms, Springfield Rifles, a full set of accouterments and drilled in accordance with the Upton's tactics. They would march in local parades and were seen at local fairs throughout the state. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, accusations of abusive and mismanagement were constantly being reported in the newspapers fueled by former disgruntled officer and inmates. Two formal investigations were conducted and the finding documented. These accusations highlighted the underlining problem of housing incorrigible boys at Westborough. By 1880, there was a decrease in commitments by the courts, and an effort was made by the board of trustees for the boys' prompt release once they reach the Honor System. This began to decrease the number of boys house at the institution, and as a result sections of the institution were closed. The salaries of those employed were reduced and duties were consolidated in order to reduce the number of staff employed. By 1882, all boys and officers were removed from the new addition, built 5 years prior, and placed in the old building. In 1883, various committees visited the Institution to determine the best way to move forward with the reform school and to use the unoccupied buildings. By a vote of the legislature in April 1884, the school was relocated to a temporary location in Westborough while a new campus could be built, and on September 30, 1884, the State Reform School for Boys was renamed the Lyman School school for boys. Some notable improvements during this period included a new coal shed located at the \\"State Farm Station\\" 100 feet long and 24 feet wide, allowing for the storage of coal from the railroad.State Farm Station was located approximately 3/4 mile north from the institution along the Agricultural Branch Railroad in Northborough and opened in 1855. It would later be renamed the Hospital Station and later still the Talbot Station. The State Farm Station is labeled on this map as the depot. This allowed coal to be stored and hauled 3/4 mile in Northborough rather than being 2.5 miles from Westborough. In 1878, the first telegraph wire was erected from the institution to the office of Samual M Griggs near the railroad depot in the center of Westborough.Information on Samual M Griggs can be found in The History of Westborough Massachusetts = Riot and judicial inquiry = On January 12, 1877, after eating supper and while still in the dining room, one of the inmates threw a bowl at a teacher and hit him in the head, creating an ugly cut that bled profusely. Other boys joined in and before it was over, 97 bowls were thrown at officers. The boys all rushed into the yard, where they were soon collected, and the officers took them to the schoolrooms. The boys who had plotted the riot grabbed ice skates and attacked the officers in schoolrooms. At the same time, other boys turned off the gas lights, and in the darkness the officers escaped out the door. The boys then barricaded the doors and proceeded to use settees as battering rams on the barred windows. They destroyed all the desks and other furniture in the classrooms and were able to gain access to the roof. The superintendent summoned Edwin B. Harvey, a trustee from Westborough, and informed him of the riot and asked that he immediately ride over. The superintendent and the officers gathered a fire hose and sprayed water through any windows that the boys were throwing furniture out of. They also subdued the boys that had made their way to the roof in hopes of escape by spraying water on them as well. When Mr. Harvey arrived at the institution the riot was still in progress and the superintendent asked him to go to the Village of Westborough and gather men to help put down the uprising. After an hour, the trustee came back with 12 able men and they organized and dragged two fire hoses up the stairs and gained access to the schoolrooms. Once in the schoolroom they were able to subdue all the boys by spraying them with water. It was determined over the course of several days that 15 inmates were the main leaders of the riot. The following week these 15 inmates were transferred to Superior Court in Worcester to stand trial. Thirteen of these boys were convicted and sentenced to various terms in the House of Correction. Soon after the riot, several articles appeared in area newspapers detailing the riot and alleged abuses against the boys at the reform school. In March of that year, a committee was formed in the legislature to look into allegations of mismanagement and abusive at the reform school. The committee called as witnesses trustees, superintendents, and inmates of the institution. The committee focused on the allegations of abuse through the use of various forms of corporal punishment. Whipping upon the bare back of the boys by the officers with leather straps made in the shoe shop was a frequently used measure. Boys were held in the basement of the chapel in cells, where they were kept for days or even weeks with only rations of bread and water to eat and a cot to sleep on. There were two other forms of restraint that were called the straitjacket and the sweatbox. The straitjacket was made of leather with an attached gag to be put in the boy's mouth and the boy would be laid down until it was time to go to bed. If he did not submit, the treatment would be continued the next day. The sweatbox was a wooden box made in the woodworking shop that stood about six and a half feet tall and was just wide enough for a person to stand upright without being able to move. They would put an inmate in the box, standing up with their arms by their side with slits in the box in front of their faces to allow air to enter for breathing. They would stand in there unable to move until the end of the day. Spraying cold water from the fire hose on a boy was used as a way subdue him and hopefully modify his behavior. The results of the investigation by this committee were submitted to the legislature in a 900-page report on May 7. Based on this report, the legislature authorized the governor to appoint a new board of trustees, and they enacted laws regulating the use of corporal punishment in the reform school.

This modern lighthouse, which has been described as being shaped like a corkscrew, is situated on a headland midway between the settlements of Buenavista del Norte and Los Silos. It is one of the seven main lighthouses which mark the coastline of Tenerife, and lies between two other lighthouses; Punta de Teno to the southwest, and Puerto de la Cruz to the northeast.  Description  The lighthouse was completed in 1990, as part of the maritime lighting plan that was drawn up in the 1980s, which stressed the need for new lights at a number of locations in the Canaries. These included the contemporary designed lights at Punta del Hidalgo and Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife, Castilette on Gran Canaria, and Arenas Blancas and Punta Lava on La Palma. Considered to be a \\"remarkable design\\", it consists of two concrete towers rising from a single base, the rearward one is square, with the seaward facing tower having a spiral staircase that is open to the elements. This stairwell leads to the top of the tower with an enclosed lantern room and galleries, at a height of 40.5m. With a focal height of 77 m above sea level, the light can be seen for 20 nautical miles. Its light characteristic is made up of a pattern of four flashes of white light every eleven seconds. The lighthouse is maintained by the Port authority of the Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. It is registered under the international Admiralty number D2831.8 and has the NGA identifier of 113-23838.

This a 2-D Model capturing the Central Valley Project, created by the Bureau of Reclamation The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act is pioneering clean water act of California that expanded the enforcement authority of the State Water Resources Control Board and the 9 Regional Water Quality Control Boards. The act provided for the California Environmental Protection Agency to create the local boards and better protect water rights and water quality.  History  The Porter-Cologne Act, also known as the California Water Code, Section 7, was created in 1969 and is the law that governs water quality regulation in California. The legislation bears the names of legislators Carley V. Porter and Gordon Cologne. It was established to be a program to protect water quality as well as beneficial uses of water. This act applies to surface water, groundwater, wetlands and both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. There are nine regional water boards and one state water board that have resulted from this act. The act requires the adoption of water quality control plans that contain the guiding policies of water pollution management in California.  Mission  The act uses the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for point source discharges and waste discharge requirements (WDRs) in order to keep people from degrading the water quality of the State. The policy states: # The quality of all waters of the State shall be protected # All activities and factors affecting the quality of water will be regulated in order to attain the highest water quality within reason. # The State must be prepared to exercise its fullest power and jurisdiction in order to protect the quality of water in the State from degradation. = The enforcement of WDRs include = * cease and desist orders * clean up and abatement orders * administrative civil liability orders * civil court actions * criminal prosecutions  State Water Resource Control Board  The State Water Resources Control Board provides guidance and oversight over the nine regional water boards which oversee areas based on hydrological barriers. They are also responsible for allocating funds and reviewing the regions' decisions in order to make sure that water quality in the State isn't becoming degraded. The regional water boards are charged with implementing the law's provisions and have primary responsibility for protecting water quality in California. The regional water boards include: # North Coast # San Francisco Bay # Central Coast # Los Angeles # Central Valley # Lahontan # Colorado River Basin # Santa Ana # San Diego  Water quality control plans  The Porter-Cologne Act requires the adoption of water quality control plans that give direction to managing water pollution in California. Usually, basin plans get adopted by the Regional Water Boards and are updated when needed. The plans incorporate the beneficial uses of the waters of the State and then provide objectives that should be met in order to maintain and protect these uses. They can meet these objectives by surveillance and monitoring, and the Regional Water Boards have the authority to enforce these objectives. Along with the Regional Water Boards, the State Water Resources Board can issue and enforce permits containing waste discharge requirements in order to maintain clean surface water and groundwater. There is a water quality control plan for enclosed bays and estuaries whose objective is to protect the benthic community from direct exposure to pollutants in the sediment. It also seeks to minimize the human health risk due to the consumption of shellfish and fish that may have high levels of toxic contaminants in them. The plan also includes the beneficial uses, their objectives and how these objectives will continue to enhance the water quality. Each region has their own water quality control plan (basin plan) that identifies the specific beneficial uses of water in their region for the past, present, and future. These basin plans also all have objectives for which the plan clearly states steps that are being taken or will be taken in order to meet the objectives. These objectives are created for the purpose of keeping the water clean and safe to use beneficially. The law is based in the idea that surface and groundwater should be protected against the adverse effects of waste and other contaminants. Accordingly, the Regional Board has the authority to give out permits for the purpose of waste disposal or waste assimilation. However, the discharges of waste into the water is not a right and is up to the discretion of the Regional Board. They have the authority to authorize when the discharge is to take place, for how long, and how much waste can be put into the water.  Clean water programs  Discovery Park where the American River meets the Sacramento River. Although the regions have plans that assure the community that the state is working to maintain clean and safe surface and groundwater, there are cities that have taken it upon themselves to implement clean water programs. The California Department of Public Health had a Drinking Water Program that was transferred to the State Water Resources Control Board. The idea of safe drinking water is the basis for the cities implementing their own clean water programs. For example, Oceanside Clean Water Program is set-up to improve the water quality in their local creeks, rivers and oceans and to keep in accordance with the state and regional environmental regulations. The program focuses on education the community, specifically the developers, residents, industrial and commercial companies and the academia about pollution and how they can prevent it from happening. They monitor the water quality, inspect construction sites and perform educational outreaches to their community because they are susceptible to stormwater pollution being a coastal community. The City of Del Mar created their Clean Water Program for the purpose of protecting their natural resources such as lagoons, beaches and the Pacific Ocean from urban runoff. They have pollution from dumpsters, improperly stored hazardous materials and equipment so their staff goes out into the community and inspects construction areas, and educates the public of the situation. The public can call or email if they see urban runoff events taking place such as over irrigation, water being used to clean driveways, and building materials or dirt coming off the property of construction sites.  Implementation with respect to cannabis  Instead of cannabis farms being shut down by law enforcement, in recent years they have been getting hit by fines from the State for not having the required permits to discharge. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board gave a huge fine for water quality violations against a property owner in rural California. The owners failed to get the necessary permits prior to developing the land, and their growing resulted in discharges of highly erodible sediment and the unauthorized placement of filling a tributary. Both of which violates the Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. The California Control, Regulate, And Tax Cannabis Act of 2016 (ReformCA) allows for protocols to be implemented to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to cultivating cannabis. This act also incorporates environmental impacts, water quality and supply in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Clean Water Act, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, timber production zones, wastewater discharge permits and any other permit necessary for diverting water.  Criticism  Although agricultural runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Central Valley, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was not implemented by the Central Valley Regional Board back in 1982. Public interest groups have challenged that ruling stating that the action taken by the Board was based on the unsupported assumption that toxic discharge from agriculture did not pose a threat to the environment or the public, and with the assumption that farmers would self-regulate.

Background  The APSA evolved in the late 1990s, when the African continent was confronted with severe crises such as the civil war in Somalia, which was ongoing since 1991, and the genocide in Rwanda 1994. At the same time, the statutes of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) did not allow an intervention in the inner affairs of another state.OAU Charta In order to be able to intervene in situations of severe human rights violations, the member states of the OAU decided to establish the African Union (AU) in 2002. Two years later, the decision to establish the APSA was taken. The signature of the constitutive act of the AU marked a turning point of inner- African relations.FES:\\"The African Peace and Security Architecture. A Handbook\\", P.16 Article 4 (h) and (j) of the constitutive act allows AU member states to intervene in a third state even against the will of the respective government in case of crimes against humanity, such as war crimes and genocide. Therefore, the AU constitutive act is the first treaty under international law, which includes the right to militarily intervene in a third state based on humanitarian reasons, which is today often called a humanitarian intervention. This normative shift increased when the founding protocol of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the AU came into effect December 26, 2003.FES: \\"The African Peace and Security Architecture. A Handbook\\", P.17 The protocol defines a broad agenda for peace and security, including central elements such as conflict prevention, early warning, preventive diplomacy, conflict management, peacemaking and peacebuilding as well as support for and development of democratic policies, humanitarian actions and conflict management.FES: \\"The African Peace and Security Architecture. A Handbook\\", P.17 Consequently, the PSC founding protocol can be seen as the basis for the APSA. It is the aim of the APSA to provide the AU, the RECs and the RMs with all the instruments necessary to fulfil the tasks and mandate relating from the constitutive act of the AU and the founding protocol of the PSC.  Structure  The structure of the APSA is based on the protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (PSC Protocol, 2002).Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union Article 2 names the following five pillars of the APSA, including institutions and decision-making processes: -the Peace and Security Council (PSC), which is the central organ of the AU -the Panel of the Wise (PoW) -the Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) -the African Standby Force (ASF) -the Peace Fund The AU claims that its mandate in the area of peace and security is valid for the whole African continent. In addition to this, several Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and Regional Mechanisms (RMs) are part of the APSA.Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in the Area of Peace and Security between the African Union, the Regional Economic Communities and the Coordinating Mechanisms of the Regional Standby Brigades of Eastern Africa and Northern Africa The cooperation between the RECs and the AU is guided by the principles of subsidiarity, of complementarity and of the comparative advantages.Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in the Area of Peace and Security between the African Union, the Regional Economic Communities and the Coordinating Mechanisms of the Regional Standby Brigades of Eastern Africa and Northern Africa, Artikel IV The operationalisation of the APSA Instruments was intended to be finished until the end of 2015. However, the status of the instruments varies strongly depending on the individual instruments and organisation.  International Support  The APSA is strongly dependent on external sources financially. In 2015, 95% of the total AU budget was financed by external partners (EU, EU member states, Japan and China). In 2016, external financing was estimated to amount to 52% of the budget; however, the detailed budget plan is not known yet.

Built in 1863, it is the town's best-preserved surviving district-level one-room schoolhouse. It is now part of the local historical society's museum complex, which includes Cliffwood Hall, the town's former town hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Harold Allan School is located on the southwest side of Rebel Hill Road (Maine State Route 180), a short way south of its junction with Maine State Route 9. It stands next to Cliffwood Hall, also owned by the local historical society. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. A hip-roofed vestibule projects from the front, and a square hip-roofed addition extends to the side, fronted by a shed-roof vestibule. The building's modest decorative features include corner pilasters on the main block. The interior is mainly finished in fir flooring with beaded board wainscoting. The addition on the left retains evidence of its original use as a two-seat outhouse. The school was built in 1863, and is the only significantly unaltered one-room schoolhouse left in the town. It was originally located on Route 9, about east of the town line with Eddington, and was moved to its present location in 1912, a consequence of a decline in population and a shift in geographic demographics. By 1915 it was one of two schools left in the town, and it continued in that function until 1966, when the town's schools were consolidated into a multi-town district. The town's other school was sold into private hands and converted into a residence. This one remained vacant until 1985, when it was adapted for use as town offices and the local library. It was acquired by the local historical society in 1999.

Career From Bethnal Green, Coleman began his professional career in September 1921, initially at bantamweight and under the name 'Young Corbett' (in tribute to his hero, Gentleman Jim Corbett, later settling on 'Harry Corbett'),Daley, Alex \\"Harry Corbett\\", London Ex-Boxers Association. Retrieved 15 February 2016 beating Barney Brown and Jack Landon on consecutive days. His first eight fights included four wins and four defeats (one to Harry Mason). He won his next six fight, before losing in January 1922 to Johnny Murton. By the end of 1923 he had built up a record of 55 wins, 10 defeats, 7 losses, and 1 no contest. He started 1924 with losses to George \\"Kid\\" Nicholson, Billy Hindley, and Young George Spiers, won his next four, before losing a points decision in May to Johnny Cuthbert. He won his next nine fights, including wins over Johnny Brown, Frankie Ash, and Victor Ferrand. In February 1925 he challenged for Brown's British, Commonwealth, and European bantamweight titles at the National Sporting Club. His challenge was unsuccessful, retiring in the 16th round. He had 15 further fights that year, beating Bugler Harry Lake, Cuthbert, Battling van Dijk, and French bantamweight champion Andr√© Routis, and losing to French lightweight champion Jules Alverel. Now fighting at featherweight, Corbett beat Johnny Britton in January 1926 in a final eliminator for the British title. He followed this with a points win over Jack Kid Berg in February. In March he faced defending champion Johnny Curley at the N.S.C., losing on points. He drew his next three fights, against Berg, Edouard Mascart, and van Dijk, before beating Danish champion Knud Larsen in July. He had less success in the latter half of the year, losing to Berg, Larsen, Mascart, Cuthbert (twice), and Belgian champion Fran√ßois Sybille. He lost only one fight in 1927 (on a disqualification to Young Clancy), beating Sam Steward twice, and also defeating van Dijk and European bantamweight champion Henri Scillie. In March 1928 Corbett challenged Cuthbert for the British featherweight title at the N.S.C., the last time the belt was contested over 20 scheduled rounds. Corbett took a points verdict to become British champion. He lost to Panama Al Brown in December, and ended the year with a stoppage of Jack Kirby. Corbett defended his title against Cuthbert in March 1929, the fight ending in a draw. They met again two months later at Olympia, Cuthbert getting the points verdict to regain the title. Corbett subsequently travelled to Australia for a series of fights. Corbett moved up again in weight, and in March 1930 stopped Alf Howard at Liverpool Stadium in an eliminator for the British lightweight title, but his final eliminator against Gorge Rose was cancelled after Corbett refused to comply with the BBBofC's conditions for the fight. In September he lost to Alf Mancini and in December fought a draw with Len \\"Tiger\\" Smith. He fought a draw with Haydn Williams over 15 rounds in January 1931, and only three days later lost on points to Cleto Locatelli. He beat Howard in March and despite losing seven of eight fights later that year, met Bep van Klaveren in October for the European lightweight title, van Klaveren winning on points. Corbett was out of the ring for over a year between 1932 and 1933 after losing the sight in his left eye, and although his career had seemed to be over he continued fighting until 1936. A chain smoker all his adult life, Corbett died on 6 May 1957 in Victoria Park Chest Hospital. His brother, Dick Corbett, was also a successful boxer.

The church is situated on the eastern banks of the Sag√•n river. Norrby parish is in the Diocese of V√§ster√•s of the Church of Sweden. The church building Norrby Church has medieval origins but was rebuilt to its current form at the end of the 1800s. The church building has a frame of stone and consists of three naves. On the west side of the main nave is the church tower with entrance. Creation and refurbishment The original stone church was probably built around the year 1300. In the 1500s the church was expanded to the north. During the 1600s and 1700s, there were repeated strengthening efforts to stabilise the arches and porch. In 1741 a new arched roof was built, and at the same time the church floor was paved. 1785 saw a major renovation and extension under the direction of master mason Johan Sundberg. The southern porch was demolished and the north wall was raised to the same level as in the south. The old roof was demolished and a new roof with heavier trusses were built. Meanwhile, enlarged window openings and the foundation of the church tower was added. New trail shutters were built in the cemetery wall's southern and eastern sides. Southeastern fa√ßade Rebuilding the current appearance In 1887 a major renovation was conducted, designed by architect Gustaf Dahl (1835-1927), when the church was remodeled to the neo- Romanesque style. The renovation meant that the exterior walls were built on. Also, the original tower from the 1700s was completed. The church was extended to the east. The nave was given a new tall roof covered with slate. Old arches were demolished and instead divided the church into three naves with cast iron pillars. The arched roof is built of wood. Renovations in the 1900s 1937 saw an internal rebuilding effort by architect Viktor Segerstedt (1878-1963). Existing tiled floor with the base floor was removed. The current floor of hard-baked bricks were put down. The round chancel window was fitted with a stained-glass window made of glass by artist John √ñsterlund (1875-1953). The restoration was carried out in 1960 under the direction of the palace architect Ragnar Jonsson (1918-2001). The church's western section was rebuilt and the current benches were installed. A mural above the altarpiece was created by conservators G√∂sta Lindstr√∂m (1905-1989). Features The baptismal font of stone is from the Middle Ages and possibly as old as the original church. The altar in Rococo ornamental style was made in 1752 by Magnus Granlund. The altar is gilded. The pulpit was carved in 1647 by master Lars predikstolsmakare. In 1758 its original colours were gilded to match the altarpiece. The present organ, with fifteen voices, was added in 1960 and replaced an organ from the 1600s. Ingrid Telhammer.

An amateur archaeologist, Erich Eixner went back to the excavation site at night and found the larger part of the bronze cauldron, containing 560 coins and an additional lump of 1500 coins, using his metal detector. He informed the authorities of his discovery and received about 20,000 DM, a fraction of the estimated worth. Historical context The hoard was hidden for the first time in 167 AD, probably because of the Antonine Plague. The last time it was probably buried while Augusta Treverorum was beleaguered by Clodius Albinus, since the latest coins were struck 196 AD under Septimius Severus. Coins The earliest coins in the hoard were minted 63 AD, during the reign of Nero. 99% of the coins were minted before 167 AD. Only six coins were struck between 193 and 196 AD. The coins weigh between 5.8 and 7.6 gram. 40 Roman emperors and their relatives are depicted on the coins. The total number of coins originally in the bronze cauldron is estimated to be 2650.

The first of this road, is in the process of being developed into the Kampala‚ÄìMpigi Expressway. Location The road begins in the Kibuye neighborhood, in Makindye Division, southwestern Kampala. It continues to Busega, then through Kyengera, Nsangi, Mpigi and Lukaya, to end at Masaka, a distance of approximately . Overview This road is one of the busiest in the country, with an average daily traffic count of 20,908 vehicles in 2008. In 2009, the government of Uganda (GOU), began to upgrade the previously bitumen-surfaced road in poor state, to grade II bituminous surface with drainage channels, culverts and shoulders. The first phase of improvements began in 2009 and ended in 2011, fully funded by the GOU. The first phase cost US$44.8 million (about Sh103 billion). During the second phase of the road improvement, the road was widened from to , passing and climbing lanes were added as well as pedestrian and bicyclists' lanes. The work was contracted to Reynolds Construction Company, who had carried out he first phase. The second phase lasted from 2012 until 2013. Despite the improvements, the road remains one of the most accident-prone highways in the country. Accidents The Kampala‚ÄìMasaka Road is the most accident-prone stretch of highway in Uganda, recording between 200 and 300 fatalities annually. Ugandan officials attribute the high accident rate to several factors including (a) speeding (b) failure to observe traffic signs (c) overloading of passenger vehicles (d) overloading of merchandise trucks (e) dilapidated vehicles (f) driving while intoxicated (g) lax laws against traffic offenses (h) a slow justice system. Kibuye‚ÄìBusega section In October 2020, the New Vision newspaper reported that the government of Japan, through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), was evaluating the financing of the section from Kubuye to Busega, where this road intersects with the Entebbe‚ÄìKampala Expressway and the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway. It is envisaged to construct an elevated dual-carriage highway for the entire length of this section. Preliminary estimates have put the cost of this section of urban highway at about US$500 million.

It is relevant for UK enterprise law and the regulation of UK wind power. Facts An offshore wind farm near the Energy Futures Centre was initially proposed by the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) in 2003. The original plan was for 20 two-megawatt turbines in an eight kilometres long row about 1 kilometre offshore. American billionaire and future United States President Donald Trump purchased a large part of the Menie estate near the village of Balmedie in 2006. He proposed to build a golf course called Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, with a hotel, holiday homes and a residential village. He expressed his concerns about the wind farm in April 2006 stating that \\"I want to see the ocean, I do not want to see windmills.\\" In 2006 RSPB Scotland expressed concern about the effect the wind farm and Donald Trump's golf course would have on the wildlife on the Aberdeenshire coast. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond helped Trump through local land disputes to enable the golf resort. In 2011, Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm Ltd applied to construct and operate the Aberdeen Bay Wind Farm (European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre) with 11 turbines, about 3.5 km from the resort. The proposed windfarm would be visible from the resort and several other golf courses, like Newburgh On Ythan, Murcar Links, Royal Aberdeen and others, some of which also have nearby turbines. In September 2011 the Trump Organization filed an objection to the planning application. Donald Trump also wrote to Salmond objecting to the turbines calling them \\"environmentally irresponsible\\". In a follow-up letter in the same month, he went on to describe the wind turbines as \\"ugly\\", and that he was \\"fighting for the benefit of Scotland.\\" In January 2012, Donald Trump halted work developing the golf resort pending a decision on the wind farm by Scottish ministers. In March 2012, Trump sent another letter to Alex Salmond warning the first minister that he would become \\"known for centuries\\" as \\"the man who destroyed Scotland\\". Appearing before the Scottish Parliament's economy, energy and tourism committee in April 2012, he claimed that he had been \\"lured\\" into building the golf resort upon assurances by the former and current first ministers, Jack McConnell and Alex Salmond, that the wind farm would not be built. Jack McConnell and Alex Salmond denied the claims. Trump stated that his golf course was due to open in July, but his plans for a hotel and hundreds of homes on the site had been put on hold. In September 2012, complaints were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority about newspaper adverts commissioned by The Trump Organization which gave \\"a misleading impression of the possible consequences of the Scottish government's plans to use wind turbines.\\" In October 2012, Trump attacked RSPB Scotland for dropping opposition to the wind farm claiming that \\"their name should be changed to RSKB - Royal Society for the Killing of Birds.\\" Later that month, his lawyers called for a public inquiry into the wind farm. In December 2012, an advertisement sanctioned by The Trump Organization appeared in print which claimed that \\"tourism will suffer and the beauty of your country is in jeopardy\\". The advert was later ruled \\"misleading\\" by the Advertising Standards Authority. When planning consent was granted by the Scottish government in March 2013, Trump vowed to \\"spend whatever monies are necessary to see to it that these huge and unsightly industrial wind turbines are never constructed.\\" =Court case= In May 2013, Trump launched a legal challenge against the Scottish government's decision to grant planning permission for the wind farm. The appellants, Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd, opposed consent for the development. It was challenged on two grounds. First, it was claimed that the Scottish Minister‚Äôs consent under the Electricity Act 1989 section 36 to build a wind farm was ultra vires. Trump Ltd argued Sch 9, para 3 gave rise to a necessary implication that only holders of licences to generate electricity, or exempt persons, could get section 36 consent. This meant the Scottish Ministers were not persons able to give consent, under sections 5 or 6 of the Electricity Act 1989. Second, Trump claimed that because condition 14 of the consent required submission and approval of a design statement, condition 14 was void for uncertainty. The hearing began at the Court of Session in November 2013, but was rejected in February 2014. An appeal against the decision was heard at the Court of Session in January 2015, but Trump lost the appeal in June 2015. After the decision Trump said he would appeal before both the Supreme Court of the UK and the European Courts. Trump was unanimously found to be the loser of the case by the UK Supreme Court in December 2015. Judgment =Court of Session= On the first ground, the Lord President stated \\"The scheme of the legislation is that the granting of a consent under section 36 and the granting of a licence or an exemption under sections 6 and 5 respectively, are two separate processes\\". On the second ground, he stated, \\"If a design statement is not satisfactory to the Ministers, there will be no approval of the construction method statement without which the development cannot begin. There is no ambiguity when condition 14 is read in that way\\". The other two judges who sat on the case concurred with this reasoning. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court unanimously held that the planning permission was sound. The nature of the Electricity Act 1989 did not support the appellant's argument. The Act sought to liberalise the electricity market in Britain, and it is not necessary for those who build generating stations to be those generating the electricity. Even if condition 14 was unenforceable, that would not be enough to invalidate the consent. Lord Hodge gave the first speech (Lord Neuberger and Lord Reed agreeing). He held under the Electricity Act 1989 section 36, consent to build a wind farm was available to anyone, before getting a licence under s 6 or a s 5 exemption. Condition 14 promoted important environmental benefits. Lord Mance agreed, adding that he ‚Äòwould not encourage advocates or courts to adopt too rigid or sequential an approach to the processes of consideration of the express terms and of consideration of the possibility of an implication.‚Äô Both Lord Neuberger and Lord Clarke recognised in M&S; that both express and implied terms are part of the process of construction as a whole. Lord Carnwath agreed, adding that implication of terms in planning cases should follow the same basic principles of implication as elsewhere in the law, disapproving Sevenoaks DC [2004] EWHC 771 (Admin). Significance Alex Salmond, the former Scottish First Minister stated that Donald Trump was \\"three times a loser\\". A spokesperson for the Trump Organization responded to this by saying: \\"Does anyone care what this man thinks? He‚Äôs a hasbeen and totally irrelevant.\\" The director of WWF Scotland stated, \\"This result is great news for Scotland and for all those interested in tackling climate change and creating jobs\\". Vattenfall decided to proceed with 11 turbines in the 92 MW wind farm in July 2016. In November 2016, President-elect Donald Trump encouraged Nigel Farage to campaign in opposition to wind farms.http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/734195/Donald-trump-Nigel-Farage- Scottish-wind-farmshttp://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/trump-scottish-wind- farms-231741 It was unclear if he would \\"use the power of the presidency to advance his business interests.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/business/with-a-meeting-trump- renewed-a-british-wind-farm-fight.html See also *UK enterprise law *Town and country planning in the United Kingdom *Scottish legal system *Electricity Act 1989 *2015 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom Notes External links *Trump's appearance before the Scottish Parliament *Supreme Court judgment *Video of the judgment  Category:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases Category:2015 in British law Category:2015 in case law Category:The Trump Organization Category:Donald Trump litigation Category:Wind power in Scotland Category:History of Aberdeenshire Category:Golf in Scotland Category:United Kingdom planning law Category:Town and country planning in Scotland Category:Court of Session cases Category:2015 in Scotland ","title":"Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd v The Scottish Ministers"},{"id":"49437500","text":"\\"Belgorod State Technological University named after V.G.Shukhov(BSTU)\\" (Russian: –ë–µ–ª–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥—Å–∫–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —É–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –∏–º. –í. –ì. –®—É—Ö–æ–≤–∞ (–ë–ì–¢–£ –∏–º. –í. –ì. –®—É—Ö–æ–≤–∞)) is the largest russian university with specialization in the field of the construction materials.

The tradition dates back to the late 17th century Ming dynasty, and was heavily persecuted during the following Qing dynasty when affiliated sects organised an uprising in 1813, led by Lin Qing. Affiliated sects appeared under various names, but during the latter half of the 18th century they adopted Bagua Jiao as their common designation. The founder, or early influential leader of Baguadao was Liu Zuochen (‚Ä†~1700), and the Liu family of Shandong maintained the leadership of the sect for decades. Baguadao networks were the first folk religions to develop \\"civil and martial work methods as one\\" (ÊñáÊ≠¶ÂäüÊ≥ïÂêà‰∏Ä w√©nw«î g≈çng f«é h√© yƒ´), and continue in contemporary Meihua (Plum Flower) practices.Storti Enrico. Yihequan, Liguajiao, Hongquan e Meihuaquan. History Little is known about the early history of the sect. In 1719 Liu Ruhan, a county magistrate by purchase in Shanxi was dismissed because his father Liu Zuochen was a member of the Shouyuandao (Êî∂ÂÖÉÈÅì \\"Way to Attain the Origin\\"), possibly an early name for Baguadao prosecuted by imperial authority as part of the White Lotus heterodoxy. With probability, Liu Zuochen was the founder of Baguadao, after having changed his original name Li Tingyu. At first he had only three disciples: a man surnamed Qin from Qingfeng County, of whom nothing is known; Gao Yunlong of Shangqiu, in Henan, who founded the Ligua (Li Trigram) subdivision; and Wang Qingrong from Heze, in Shandong, who founded the Zhengua (Zhen Trigram) subdivision. The Liu family held the role of the highest masters within the Baguadao for four generations. Historians reconstruct that Liu Zuochen died around 1701, and Liu Ruhan his son became the new head master of the Baguadao. By the 1730s the sect had developed its characteristic structure, with branches corresponding to the eight trigrams each led by a leader subordinate to Master Liu, two assistants for every leader of a trigram, and cohorts of believers. During the first year of Qianlong (1736) Liu Ruhan died and his son Liu Ke became the new leader of the Baguadao, which under his guidance grew extensively. In 1748, the thirteenth year of Qianlong, the leadership passed to Liu Shennguo, Liu Ke's son. In 1772 the then leader of the Zhengua subdivision named Wang Zhong was arrested in Shandong and the book in his possession, Xunshu (\\"Book of Instruction\\"), was found to contain references to the overthrowing of the \\"barbarian\\" Manchu dynasty. Wang Zhong was executed for refusing to reveal the name of the leader of Baguadao, but another member later confessed that he was one of the Lius in Shan County of Shandong. After investigation, Liu Shengguo was arrested and executed. The authorities discovered the vast network of Baguadao sects, with branches named after the eight trigrams of cosmology. Even after the arrest of Liu Shengguo the holy significance of the Liu family did not diminish, and minor leaders of the Baguadao continued to rely upon legitimation by the Master Liu of the day. After the 1772 crackdown, Liu Shengguo's successor Liu Tingxian was banished to the northeastern land of Xinjiang where he served as a peasant; in 1780 a leader of the Zhengua branch of Baguadao sent messengers to Xinjiang to get into contact with Liu Tingxian and convinced him to take his legitimate position as main leader of the religion. In the following decades Liu Tingxian and his sons continued the Baguadao leadership in Xinjiang, and lesser sect masters in the east continued to financially support the Liu leadership in Xinjiang through the 1800s. Beliefs and practices The \\"Writing about Five Women's Transmission of the Way\\" (‰∫îÂ•≥‰º†ÈÅìËæì W«în«öchu√°nd√†osh≈´) is the core scripture of Baguadao, and reveals a technique of neidan meditation to attain blessing, overcome human limits and reach salvation. Liu Zuochen is described in the scripture as the incarnation of Maitreya, the sun that enlightens the whole world, the son of the Eternal Venerable Mother. Palmer and Liu (2012) have studied the contents of the Baguadao as a tradition of orthodox and elaborate forms of Taoist self- cultivation techniques. Subdivisions =Early seven major divisions= The eight trigrams' cosmology was adopted as an ideal system of organisation as described in many precious scriptures of the 16th century. Within the ideal division into eight trigrams, only three of them (Zhengua, Ligua and Kangua) were influential, and there were further subdivisions which used a variety of names. For instance, the sect led by Wang Zhong, whose arrest in 1772 led to the detection of Liu Shengguo and the exile of the Lius to Xinjiang, was called the Pure Water (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ Qingshui) group, and was part of the Zhen Trigram branch. The major subdivisions as of the thirteenth year of Qianlong (1748) were seven, corresponding to seven out of the eight trigrams, leaving out the ‚ò∑ Kungua (Âù§Âç¶) which never developed: * ‚ò≤ The Ligua or Li Trigram sect (Á¶ªÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Shangqiu, Henan, under the leadership of Gao Da (ÈÉúÂ§ß), third-generation descendant of the founder Gao Yunlong (ÈÉú‰∫ëÈôá); * ‚ò≥ The Zhengua or Zhen Trigram sect (ÈúáÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Heze, Shandong, but well developed in Henan, Zhili and Jiangnan, under the leadership of Wang Zhong (Áéã‰∏≠); * ‚òµ The Kangua or Kan Trigram sect (ÂùéÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Rongcheng and Ningyang County (then both in Zhili), led by Zhang Bo (Âº†Êüè) and Kong Wanlin (Â≠î‰∏áÊûó); * ‚ò∂ The Gengua or Gen Trigram sect (ËâÆÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Jinxiang, Shandong, and leadership position held by Zhang Yucheng (Âº†ÁéâÊàê) and Zhang Jing'an (Âº†ÈùôÂÆâ), respectively father and son; * ‚ò¥ The Xungua or Xun Trigram sect (Â∑ΩÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Shan, Shandong, under the leadership of Zhang Yan (Âº†ÁÇé); * ‚ò∞ The Qiangua or Qian Trigram sect (‰πæÂç¶Êïô), having headquarters in Yucheng, Henan, under the leadership of Zhang Xing (Âº†Âßì); * ‚ò± The Duigua or Dui Trigram sect (ÂÖåÂç¶Êïô), with headquarters in Dongming, then Zhili, and leadership held by Chen Shanshan (ÈôàÂñÑÂ±±). Ligua tradition One of the most influential branches of the Baguadao was the Ligua (Li Trigram) transmission. The Li Trigram branch was more involved in the 1813 uprising against the Qing dynasty. Lin Qing founded many groups of the Li subdivision, many of which connected to the Gao family of Henan who held the central leadership of the subdivision. Under increasing persecutions Lin Qing reacted by organising a rebellion, which broke out in the 1813 uprising, which culminated in an attack to the Forbidden City in Beijing. The Gao family members were captured and by the confession of the current leader Gao Tianyou the history of the Li branch was traced back to Gao Yunlong, who was initiated by Liu Zuochen himself a century earlier. =Late 19th century: Heavenly Dragon Baguajiao= In 1860 the heritage of Baguadao gave rise to a new movement, the Heavenly Dragon Baguajiao (Â§©ÈæôÂÖ´Âç¶Êïô TiƒÅnl√≥ng BƒÅgu√†ji√†o). The religion was centered in Qiu County in modern Hebei and Shen County in Shandong, and was led by Yang Tai (Êù®Ê≥∞) and Song Jingshi (ÂÆãÊôØËØó). The new organisation grouped the eight trigram divisions in five coloured banners: the White Banner (ÁôΩÊóó b√°iq√≠) comprising Qian and Dui sects, the Yellow Banner (ÈªÑÊóó hu√°ngq√≠) comprising Kun and Gen sects, the Green Banner (ÁªøÊóó l«úq√≠) comprising Zhen and Shun sects, the Red Banner (Á∫¢Êóó h√≥ngq√≠) comprising Li sects, and the Blue Banner (ËìùÊóó l√°nq√≠) or Black Banner (ÈªëÊóó hƒìiq√≠) comprising Kan sects. A sixth banner was the Flower Banner (Ëä±Êóó huƒÅq√≠). =Contemporary development: Meihuaism= The contemporary popular sect of the Plum Flower (Ê¢ÖËä±Êïô) widespread in north China, which combines the martial aspect (Ê≠¶Âú∫ wuchang) of meihuaquan, and a civil aspect (ÊñáÂú∫ wenchang), has been studied as the continuation of the Baguadao and especially of the Ligua tradition, which was the first folk religion to see the \\"civil and martial work methods as one\\" (ÊñáÊ≠¶ÂäüÊ≥ïÂêà‰∏Ä w√©nw«î g≈çng f«é h√© yƒ´). Meihua followers were directly involved in the anti-Western Boxer Rebellion. The Plum Flower religion and martial art is practiced freely in contemporary China with a large holy see established in March 2015 in Pingxiang County of Hebei.China Economic Net Media Channel: Ê≤≥ÂåóÂπ≥‰π°Ê¢ÖÊã≥Âú£Âú∞ÁûªÁ§ºÔºåÂÖ´ÊñπÂºüÂ≠êÂ∞ÜÂ±ïÊã≥Ëâ∫. 2015-03-10 Scholar Raymond P.

E. Williams, The Derbyshire Miners, pp.814-815 He was not elected and, although he stood again in 1923, his vote fell. He was nominated again as a candidate for the 1924 general election, but given his poor performance, decided it wise to withdraw and instead back another candidate - he hoped Hugh Dalton would stand, although ultimately he did not. Following this, Wright decided to restand as the DMA nominee, but lost the nomination to Jack Lees.J. E. Williams, The Derbyshire Miners, pp.826-827 Wright then devoted his time to the union. He was appointed as one of its trustees, and in 1928 beat eleven other candidates, including Joseph Lynch and Samuel Sales, to become the DMA's treasurer. He served in the post for ten years, but he suffered from poor health and had to take frequent absences due to illness. He died, still in office, in 1938.

Biography He was born in 1968 in Brescia, Italy. In 1992 he graduated with a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Milan. He is married with three children. Between 1995 and 2000, he was a member of a project team set up by Ansaldo Trasporti to build Copenhagen's automatic metro. In the mid-nineties, when Mazzoncini was 26, the apartment complex where he lived blew up due to a gas leak. Elected as spokesperson for the complex by his neighbours, he dealt with the insurance company and arranged to have the apartments demolished and rebuilt. The owner of the construction company that was tasked with the job also owned Autoguidovie, a public transport company that focused on road transport. Impressed with his management skills, he offered Mazzoncini a job as team leader. In 1998, he became Director of the same company. While he directed Autoguidovie, the company acquired holdings in various public transport companies owned by local bodies. Among these was the public transport utility of Reggio Emilia, the mayor of which, at the time, was Graziano Delrio, the Italian Minister of Infrastructures and Transports at the time. In 2012, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Spa introduced a new company called Busitalia, which aimed to expand the group's role in the public road transport sector. Mauro Moretti, at the time CEO of the group, personally asked Mazzoncini to head this new holding. He accepted, at the condition that he would be CEO and Director-general of every new company held by Busitalia. The first acquisition he made while at Busitalia was Azienda Trasporti Area Fiorentina, the public transport network operator in Florence. On the first meeting as CEO of the company, he sacked the entire executive board. While restructuring ATAF, he met Matteo Renzi, who at the time was mayor of Florence and would go on to become Prime Minister. Their partnership reportedly started with a quarrel: a raise in the prices of bus tickets prompted a very heated reaction from an infuriated Renzi, who phoned Mazzoncini while he was skiing in Northern Italy. After meeting in person, the two reportedly got along much better. In 2014, Busitalia and Autoguidovie formed a joint venture, giving rise to the biggest local public transport player in the country. In 2015, he became CEO of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Spa, replacing Moretti. He stated that Renzi and Delrio, at the time respectively Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructures and Transports, offered him the role because both of them had previously experienced first-hand his abilities as CEO. In 2016, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane approved a new Industrial Plan for the 2017-2026 period, which includes 94 billion ‚Ç¨ in investments and aims to develop both the regional rail transport and freight transport sectors. He was elected Chairman of the International Union of Railways (UIC) on December 1, 2016. In 2017, the holding has launched a new company called Mercitalia, which aims to unify the previously fragmented position of the group in the freight transport sector. In 2017 he has been appointed as Professor in Mobility: Infrastructure and Services at the Polytechnic University of Milan. On 10 January 2018, the Board of Directors of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane confirmed Renato Mazzoncini as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Group for 2018 - 2020. On 25 July 2018, Renato Mazzoncini was removed from his roles in Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane by the Minister of Infrastructures and Transport, Danilo Toninelli.

On 18 November 2016, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople sent a letter to the Archbishop of Athens asking him to admonish some of the Greek Orthodox clergy who reject the Holy and Great Council. According to the document, Patriarch Bartholomew reserved to himself the right to sever ecclesiastical and sacramental communion with those clergymen if Greek ecclesiastical authorities decide not to act on the patriarch's request to discipline them. As Dr. Ines Murzaku, professor of Ecclesiastical History and Founding Chair of the Department of Catholic Studies at Seton Hall University, elaborated in her email interview to Crisis Magazine, such \\"interference and pressure to excommunicate might sound more as rules/jurisdiction that apply in the West‚Äú, and for this reason the Patriarch Bartholomew \\"might be viewed by many as ‚Äòthe Pope of the East‚Äô or ‚ÄòOrthodox Pope‚Äô‚Äù. However, other Catholic scholars such as Ludwig Hertling, would disagree as he says in his book, Communio: Church and Papacy in Early Christianity, anyone could and did break communion when the parties felt necessary. The most prominent example is the excommunications between Patriarch Michael Kerularios and Cardinal Humbert (a representative of Pope Leo, but not Leo himself) when the latter excommunicated the former. That is still practiced in the Church today. The Patriarch's request for admonishment concerning the clerics in question is not based on their rejection of the Council per se, since others also disagree, but with the manner they conduct their activities as well as their allegations and charges, including that of heresy (both type of actions denounced by the Holy Synods of other autocephalous Churches). Participants and delegations =Churches that attended= =Churches that did not attend= Church of Antioch The Antiochian Church pulled out due to the dispute over the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Qatar that is also claimed by the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Antiochian Church joined the Church of Georgia in their reservations toward the pre-conciliar document about marriage, and also disagreed with the document about the Orthodox diaspora. There were other matters which the Antiochian Church desired to discuss, such as the calendar issue, but had been removed from the agenda due to lack of consensus on the issue. Still desiring to convene a Pan-Orthodox Council with full participation, the Antiochian Church considers the 2016 meeting to be \\"a preliminary meeting towards the Pan-Orthodox Council, [and thus considers] its documents not final, but still open to discussion and amendment upon the convocation of the Great Pan-Orthodox Council in the presence and participation of all the Autocephalous Orthodox Churches.\\"  Russian Church  The Russian Orthodox Church pulled out because of her belief that the council is not truly \\"pan-orthodox\\" without the Antiochan, Bulgarian, or Georgian churches.Russian Church insists on rescheduling Pan-Orthodox Council.

Church of Bulgaria The Bulgarian Orthodox Church pulled out due to disagreements on some of the texts already approved for the Synod meeting, and specifically that those texts would not be subject to editing in the course of discussions, though that seemed to be a misunderstanding, since all documents were opened for discussion and other Churches went ready to and did amend them.Clive Leviev-Sawyer. Bulgarian Orthodox Church withdraws from Pan- Orthodox Council in Crete. The Sofia Globe. June 1, 2016. Church of Georgia The Georgian Orthodox Church pulled out due to disagreements about several of the Synod's documents, in particular \\"The Relation of the Orthodox Church with the Rest of the Christian World\\". In December 2016 the holy synod of the Church of Georgia rejected the claim that the council, which it refers to as the \\"Council of Crete\\", was Pan Orthodox and the idea that its texts reflected Orthodox Teaching. Orthodox Church in America The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) was not invited due to the lack of recognition of her autocephaly by some other autocephalous Churches. However, the jurisdiction did support the Council and its convocation by sending clergy scholars from among them to help with the event before, during, and after. In addition, she released an official letter in support of the Council and a special prayer to be included during every Divine Liturgy in every diocese. Also, OCA scholars were among the drafters of a special letter sent to every autocephalous Church urging them to support the convocation of the Council during the time when critical voices were pressuring certain Churches to not attend the synod just a few days before it was to meet. However, the OCA has not released a post- Council statement, and Metropolitan Tikhon has been in the process of resuming the discussion between the OCA and the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

They are located on Benmont and Holden Avenues, near the former Holden‚ÄìLeonard Mill Complex, Bennington's largest employer in the late 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The Holden‚ÄìLeonard Mill is located northwest of downtown Bennington, on the eastern bank of the Walloomsac River, bounded by Holden and Leonard Streets to the north and south, and Benmont Avenue to the east. Extending south from the mill on Benmont Avenue are a series of duplexes and tenement-style multiunit residential buildings. There are eleven buildings fronting on Benmont Avenue, and two that face Holden Street. All are 1-1/2 to three stories in height, and all but one are wood frame structures with modest vernacular interpretations of architectural styles popular at the time of their construction. The one exception is the brick building at 121 Benmont Avenue, a brick structure originally built as the mill company store; it has exuberant Italianate styling reminiscent of that found on the main mill's buildings of the 1860s. The complex now known as the Holden‚ÄìLeonard Mill was established in 1865, with the construction of its central \\"Big Mill\\" by what was then called the Bennington Manufacturing Company. Between then and 1875, that company built most of the housing in this district to provide homes for some of its workers, as well as the company store, whose upper floors were eventually also converted into tenement-style living spaces. The two duplexes at 124-126 and 128-130 Benmont were both built about 1900, and were built to match in style the earlier housing on the street.

Meso-finance loans start from an amount of 1000 euro and are specifically meant for small- and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs that are in need of extra capital are often too large for micro credits due to their higher level of firm complexity compared to small enterprises, but too small for regular loans from a bank. Banks often refuse loan requests from SMEs, due to a lack of in-depth accounting data and make SME finance very difficult. Since the reported financial information is often very basic, this means that these financial overviews often do not live up to the requirements set by banks. As a result, SMEs often miss out on capital access from either micro finance, or regular bank loans. Therefore, the SME sector is also named the 'missing middle'.

Their weapons were a .22 caliber rifle, a semiautomatic pistol, and a shotgun. Shaila Dewan of the Houston Press wrote that, according to Billy Stephens of the Houston Police Department (HPD), the fact that \\"the robberies were so well planned and executed\\" was what \\"struck\\" him the most, and not merely that the perpetrators were upper middle class females. Dunn and Morneau discussed the robberies with other people, attracting the attention of authorities. Arrest and prosecution The HPD had the perpetrators in custody by August 6 of that year. Prior to the arrest the police sent undercover officers to eavesdrop on the girls when they were in public. The police stated that of the perpetrators, Dunn was the most cooperative. An assistant principal of Kingwood High identified perpetrators after listening to audiotapes of the robberies that occurred in Montgomery County. Convictions for armed robbery could have resulted in any sentence from probation to 99 years of prison.\\"Teen-agers On Trial\\" (Archive). CBS News/48 Hours. April 13. 2000.

Maddox's case went on trial in Dallas, Texas, with a change of venue, in March 2000. The three other girls testified against her. She was convicted on April 10 of that year, and on April 14 she received a prison sentence of 7 1/2 years. Maddox received a longer sentence since she was the ringleader. Dunn and Warzeka pleaded guilty to armed robbery and chose to have juries determine their sentences. The girls each received two concurrent prison sentences of 7 years, with parole eligibility in 3 years. Morneau, who agreed to testify against her accomplices, received deferred adjudication from Mark Kent Ellis, a Texas state district judge. He required her to attend boot camp and serve parole. She attended her boot camp at the Harris County Boot Camp in Atascocita, and she had to serve 10 years of probation and perform 2,000 hours of community service. Morneau had stayed in the car during the robberies, so she got a lighter sentence. =Incarceration and parole hearings= Maddox chose to stay in the Dallas County Jail as her appeal was launched; if a prisoner is sentenced to fewer than ten years in prison in Texas, he or she may stay in a county jail while his or her appeal occurs. As of 2000 Dunn was located in the Harris County Jail and Warzeka was in the Lucile Plane State Jail.

It was modelled on the Westminster system. It began as a nominated, exclusively European institution and evolved into an electable legislature with universal suffrage. It was succeeded by the National Assembly in 1963. Early years On 26 October 1906 an Order in Council was issued in London defining a new constitution for the East Africa Protectorate. The post of Commissioner was replaced with that of Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils, consisting of both official and unofficial members, were created.Ross W. McGregor (2012) Kenya from Within: A Short Political History, Routledge The first Legislative Council met on 7 August 1907.Robert M. Maxon & Thomas P. Ofcansky (2014) Historical Dictionary of Kenya, Rowman & Littlefield, p203 The meeting was attended by the Governor, Sir James Sadler, six officially appointed members Henry Currie, Charles Bowring, CW Hobley, J Montgomery, RM Coombe and Colonel J Wilson and two unofficial members J.H. Wilson from Mombasa and Lord Delamere. The first Council consisted solely of persons of European descent. On 21 September 1909, Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee was appointed to the Council, becoming the first Asian and non-European member. The then Governor, Sir Percy Girouard opposed his nomination, but he was overruled by the Colonial Office who were keen to appoint a representative for the Indian community.Abdullahi Sara, Kenya at a Crossroads: Administration and Economy Under Sir Percy Girouard, 1909‚Äì1912, Lexington Books, 22 Oct 2015 From 1911 the European settler community demanded the right to elect the unofficial members sitting in the Council, a request which was regularly denied by the Colonial Office. In 1917 the nominated members of the Council resigned their seats in protest, only returning on the promise by the Colonial Office that they would take steps to introduce legislation at cessation of the First World War. Introduction of elections The Legislative Council Ordinance, 1919 expanded the Council to seventeen official members, including eleven European members elected by European residents. European women were now eligible to become members for the first time. The first elections under this new system took place in 1920. The Legislative Council (Amendment) Ordinance of 1924 provided that there should be five members elected to represent the Indian community and one member to represent the Arab community. In the 1924 elections Hamed Mohamed bin Issa became the first elected Arab member; however, the Indian community abstained from putting forward candidates in protest at not being given parity of seats with the European community. Reverend J.W. Arthur became the first official member nominated to represent the interests of the African community.History of the Parliament of Kenya Parliament of Kenya A single Indian candidate, Ahmad Hussein Malik, participated in the 1927 elections and was duly returned unopposed. Following the elections, four Indians were also nominated as members. Indian seats were filled from the 1931 elections onwards. Eliud Mathu became the first African member when he was nominated by the Governor to represent the African community at the 1944 election. Benaiah Ohang became the second African member in 1946. Wider franchise In 1951, legislation was enacted providing for the election of 14 Europeans, six Asians and one Arab member. In addition, six Africans and one Arab would be nominated. This would result in there being 28 non-government members and 26 government members. The first elections held under this system were held in 1952. The Lyttleton Constitution of 1954 introduced significant reforms. A Council of Ministers was created, with six official members from the Civil Service, two nominated members and six unofficial members all appointed by the Governor. The six unofficial members were appointed from elected members, three of which were European, two Asian, and one African. The first African minister was Benaiah Ohang. The first elections under the new system were held in 1956. Elected representation was introduced for Africans, with elections held to fill the eight seats the following year; Bernard Mate, Ronald Ngala, Tom Mboya, Oginga Odinga, Masinde Muliro, Lawrence Oguda, Daniel arap Moi and James Muimi became the first African elected members. In 1958, the Council was expanded again, this time under the Lennox-Boyd Constitution and now consisted of fourteen Africans, fourteen Europeans, three Asians and three Arabs. The Lennox-Boyd Constitution was amended following the first Lancaster House Conference in 1960, after which the Council of Ministers was limited to sixteen members, of which four were civil servants, four African, three European and one Asian. The 1961 elections were the first to have a majority of African seats; the 65-member Council had twelve appointed members, 33 general seats and 20 reserved seats for minority communities (ten for Europeans, eight for Indians and two for Arabs).Elections in Kenya African Election Database Primary elections were held for the reserved seats by members of the respective communities, and candidates receiving at least 25% of the vote advanced to the main elections,Maxon & Ofcansky, p202 where all registered voters could vote for them. In 1962 the Lancaster Constitution stipulated that the Legislative Council was to be succeeded by a bicameral parliament, consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives. The 1963 elections were the first to the new legislature.

It is one of two parks within the Mt. Shasta Recreation and Parks District and hosts the district's headquarters. Mt. Shasta City Park spans 26 acres and offers a variety of opportunities for recreation such as hiking, picnicking and biking. Many community events occur within the park buildings and in the surrounding park land. The park is also home to the headwaters of the Upper Sacramento River.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcjr-9xTunk  Recreation  Mount Shasta \\"Big Springs\\", headwaters of the Sacramento River. Mt. Shasta City Park is complete with picnic tables, benches, playground equipment, trails for viewing nature, the Headwaters Bridge, biking trails, a large field, community buildings and the Headwaters Spring. Many of the buildings onsite are available for rental and to host events throughout the year. Upper Lodge Recreation Center features a stage, commercial kitchen, and is capable of seating over 185 people. Overlooking the headwaters spring, Lower Lodge offers similar activities as the Upper Lodge Recreation Center on a smaller scale. The historic Rod and Gun Building is available for rental Spring through Fall, and The Dance Hall offers room for wedding receptions, dances, and is the former home of the Dudes and Daisies Square Dance Club.

Headwaters of the Sacramento River  Locals or travelers filling up their water bottles with \\"Big Springs\\" water. Vegetation and water present at Mount Shasta City Park.Mount Shasta Despite this sign's presence, visitors continue to drink from the springs. The headwaters of the Sacramento River emerge directly from the side of Big Springs Hill in Mount Shasta City Park. City Park contains the Big Springs headwaters, a source of water for the Upper Sacramento River. Originally glacial melt, water from Big Springs headwaters emerges directly from the porous rocks in the side of Big Springs Hill after more than 50 years of filtration through volcanic rock. This water comes from Big Springs Aquifer, a volcanic aquifer below the Mount Shasta area. The spring water converges into a shallow pool before cascading downstream into Stream Creek and continuing its journey to the Sacramento River. The \\"Big Springs\\" draw both locals and travelers to partake in the virgin drinking water, providing a break from a long journey, a place to meet new people, and to admire the scenery. There is no swimming or wading allowed in the springs or stream. = Water Details = The Big Springs Aquifer produces about 38 acre-feet of water per day or 12,274,000 gallons per day into the Upper Sacramento River. The water exits from Big Springs Aquifer through the side of Big Springs Hill in Mount Shasta City Park, converges into Spring Creek and through Mount Shasta Fish Hatchery. After, it combines with Wagon Creek, flows into Lake Siskiyou and Box Canyon Dam before entering the Sacramento River. Next, it enters Shasta Lake and continues its journey through the Central Valley Water Project (CVP) systems. The Upper Sacramento River supplies approximately 15 percent of inflow into Shasta Lake. This water eventually becomes part of the Central Valley Water Project (CVP) and is distributed throughout the Valley and provides habitat for aquatic life.  History  Before Mt. Shasta City Park was developed, the land provided hunting grounds for the Wintun, Okwanuchu, and Maidu Native American tribes until 1841 when foreign explorers encountered the land. In 1901, \\"Big Springs\\" was fixed with a water wheel that provided Mt. Shasta City with its first source of energy. It supplied a small amount of electricity used for street lights. From 1920-1943 the park property was used by California State University, Chico, as the summer campus for the Teacher's College. The park buildings still in use today originated from this time. In 1947, California State University, Chico, deeded the park property to Mt. Shasta City and in 2005 the city gave the property to the Mt. Shasta Recreation and Parks District. Originally, the Recreation Center building served as the local National Guard Armory. Today the Recreation Center is used for a variety of community events and programs.  Water health The water emerging from the Big Springs headwaters emerges from the Big Springs aquifer. The aquifer has a flow rate of 420 l/s an average temperature of 6.8 ¬∞C, a pH of 6.71, a siO2 concentration of 53.4 mg/l, Calcium concentrations of 3.7 mg/l of water, and a Mg concentration of 3.18 mg/l. Locals and travelers visit Mt. Shasta City Park for the \\"Big Springs\\" headwaters of the Sacramento River. The water was initially glacial melt that had filtered through volcanic rock slowly over time. Many locals treat the Headwaters as their local hangout spot where neighbors and friends convene to chat while filling up giant containers of water which they will use later for cooking and drinking. Some individuals prefer to use the water from the Headwaters over their own tap or well water. Although the water has not been treated, it is considered safe to drink. There is a sign on display directly next to the headwaters warning visitors that the water has not been tested and may not be safe to drink, and that no wading is allowed.  Restoration projects and goals  A restoration project occurring at Mount Shasta City Park. Mt. Shasta Recreation and Parks District has worked to ensure Mt. Shasta City Park is healthy and bountiful. Many varieties of flowers and other vegetation are planted around the park and labeled. There are often flowers in bloom and during the warmer months pollinators like hummingbirds, butterflies, and bees frequent the area. Pedestrian traffic over time raised concerns for the health of the ecosystem around the spring and restoration projects began. In 2007, a non-profit organization known as The River Exchange began to work on Mt Shasta City Park. The addition of a concrete slab next to the spring allows for easier access to the water without having to travel on the rocks within the pool. This project also stabilized the base of Spring Hill to minimize erosion, add more pedestrian access to the park such as small trails that wind through the park, introduced benches and tables, and added more local native plants.  Controversial water bottling by Crystal Geyser  In 2013 Crystal Geyser purchased a water bottling plant across the street from Mount Shasta City Park. They intend to tap into water from the Big Springs aquifer for their water bottling facility. There is some opposition to the water bottling facility tapping into Big Springs Aquifer. The concern over losing this component of local daily lives has resulted in a push to study the water quality and chemistry within the Big Springs aquifer. These locals are hoping to stop the Crystal Geyser facility from using their water source for profit. Before the facility begins production, locals have pushed for an environmental impact report that is scheduled to begin in 2016 and be completed in January 2017. The Crystal Geyser facility intends to dispose of its waste wateronsitee via leeching pools. Citizens have shown concern over this waste water leeching into Big Springs Aquifer. The Crystal Geyser facility is estimated to employ approximately 60 people from the local community, and boost the economy by supplying roughly $40 million to the Siskiyou community annually. Crystal Geyser estimates that the water extracted from Big Springs Aquifer will be approximately 115,000 gallons per day (gpd), which is less than 1% of the aquifer's total output. Although the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) addresses potential groundwater overdraft in California, it only covers alluvial basins and does not include volcanic basins such as the Big Springs Aquifer.

This agency will oversee the construction and management of the facility that will pump water from the Sacramento River to the two cities. This new facility is to provide reliable water supply, improve the water quality for drinking purposes, and improve the treated wastewater discharge from the two cities. This new facility is expected to be supplying the cities with clean surface water in June 2016.  History  = Current water source = Woodland and Davis both rely 100 percent on ground water. Wells typically have a life span of thirty to forty years. Woodland has nineteen wells scattered about the city, twelve of which are thirty years old or older. Davis has around twenty-three wells, fourteen that are thirty years old or older. This water infrastructure was introduced in the 1950s and was adequate at the time of implementation, but now is not able to meet state and federal water regulations. Several wells in Woodland and Davis have been shut down because of water quality issues and aging. Water in these areas have high salinity content, which then becomes recycled into the surface and ground water and impacts the environment. The water also has high levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6) which is a tasteless and odorless metal. The state permits 10 parts per billion, where as Woodland tests 22 parts per billion. With the growing population, groundwater will not fulfill the demand for water in these locations. = Obtaining water rights = Water rights were established in the early 1900s and may be purchased from someone who has either riparian or appropriative rights. The agency obtained water rights from the Conway Preservation Group, who had riparian water rights. Conway signed over their riparian property for $2.6 Million dollars upfront in 2016 and each year thereafter with a two percent increase over the next 24 years. After the 24 years the cities will then own the land. The agency also acquired a water permit from the State Water Resource Control Board. Permit 20281 allows water to be diverted from the Sacramento River at monthly rates up to 80 cubic-feet per second, at an annual rate up to 45,000 acre-feet a year.  Construction  = Builders = Location of the intake The WDCWA awarded Colorado based company, CH2M Hill, which is a full service consulting company that will design, build, operate, and maintain the facility (DBO), a $141 million contract. This contract includes the joint intake station, pipelines to the new treatment facility, pipelines to Davis and Woodland once water is treated, and improve the cities supply systems. CH2M is a global company that operates specifically within the environmental sector concentrating in water, energy, transportation. = Intake and facility specifics = This facility will use flash mixing, sand ballasted clarification, ozonation, gradual media filtration, and chlorine addition. The intake station is a reinforced-concrete structure approximately 46 feet tall from the river bottom. The structure will span approximately 200 feet along the river face. There will be ten individual fish screen panels each being 10 feet high by 14 feet wide made from durable stainless steel. Because water will be transferred to two cities, the water will be pumped at the intake station to an open canal a short distance away and will then be delivered through pipelines to the cities. = Expectations of water service = This new facility is expected to reach more than two- thirds of the urban population in Yolo, Co along with UC Davis, who is also a project partner. The water treatment facility will supply 30 million gallons per day, which will be 18 million gallons per day to woodland and 12 million gallons per day to Davis. The facility will also will also irrigate 15,000 acres of crops for agriculture. The intake along the Sacramento River will divert 45,000 acre feet a year (depending on rainfall). This will be regulated by the state during summer and dry months (from the water permit from the State Water Resource Control Board) . The water purchase from Conway Farms, which had a senior water right, will allow 10,000 acre feet to be pumped during the summer months and has fewer regulations during aril-oct. There will be no added fluoride to the water supply. Both Woodland and Davis will raise utility fees to help cover some of the costs for the project. Woodland will see 17 percent increase in their water bills and will gradually go up over the next three years.  Environmental benefits  Fish screens on the new intake facility Clean and reliable water was on the forefront of this deal, but the current environmental impacts of the old intake station was the main concern for many environmental agencies. The fish screens were an important factor in building the new intake station and were required by state agencies. The state granted the WDCWA $2 million to incorporate those fish screens as well as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, who awarded the agency $8.1 million for the screens as well. These screens will protect the fish, many of which are listed on Endangered Species Act. As said before, water in Woodland and Davis contains a high salinity content and is recycled thought the water system. A 2009 annual average wastewater discharge flows and discharge water quality showed 80,000 pounds of salt per day being discharged into local watersheds from the two cities. This eventually connects to the delta. This new facility will prevent this runoff into the river by 48 percent.

Morsch (January 21, 1906 ‚Äì July 3, 1972) was an American librarian who served as President of the American Library Association from 1957 to 1958. Morsch also worked as the Deputy Chief Assistant Librarian of Congress from 1953 to 1962. Education and career in libraries Morsch began her career as a cataloger in the library of the University of Iowa as a student, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree. She went on to receive B.S. and M.S. degrees in Library Science from Columbia University, in 1929 and 1930 respectively, serving two years as the Lydia Roberts Fellow. She returned to work at the University of Iowa for five years before taking a position as chief classifier at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Morsch joined the Library of Congress in 1940, becoming the first chief of the new Descriptive Cataloging Division in 1940. She served as chief of the Descriptive Cataloging Division from 1940 to 1950 and again from 1962 to 1965. In that role she was heavily involved in the development of standardized cataloging rules and cataloging code revision; she completed the first thorough revision of the Library's descriptive cataloging rules in 1949. From 1953 to 1962, Morsch served as Deputy Chief Assistant Librarian of Congress from 1953 to 1962. In this role she was primarily concerned with the Library of Congress's relationships with other libraries and with scholarly and cultural institutions in the United States and abroad. She retired from the Library of Congress in 1965 after twenty-five years of service there. Leadership and recognition Morsch was the first recipient of the Margaret Mann Citation from the American Library Association in 1951 for her leadership in creating the Rules for Descriptive Cataloging in the Library of Congress, which clarified and simplified cataloging rules for libraries. She served as president of the District of Columbia Library Association from 1954 to 1955. Her inaugural speech as president of the American Library Association on June 25, 1957 was titled \\"Promoting library interests throughout the world,\\" emphasizing the importance of international relations. That speech was regarded by at least one critic as anti-Communist in tone. Morsch served on a Civil Liberties Committee in 1960 to examine statements from the American Library Association regarding racial segregation in libraries and to formulate an official policy statement. The Committee's policy statement took the form of an addition to ALA's Library Bill of Rights, asserting that the \\"rights of an individual to the use of a library should not be denied or abridged because of his race, religion, national origin or political views\\"; this statement was adopted by the organization in 1961 in a near-unanimous vote. In 1966 Morsch was awarded the Melvil Dewey Award by the American Library Association, which recognizes \\"creative leadership of high order\\" in librarianship. Personal life and death Morsch married Werner B. Ellinger in 1944. She had a small collection of postcards depicting libraries that had been mailed to her by colleagues; she donated her collection to librariana collector Norman Stevens before her death. Morsch was found dead in her apartment in Washington, DC on July 3, 1972, after losing her husband just a few weeks earlier.

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured. The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.  The Greene ancestry  Most of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Judge Greene married Joanna \\"Hannah\\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York. Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored. Judge William Greene and Joanna Reeder Greene were the great-grandparents of Jeremiah Greene, who along with other Greene relatives migrated to an area near Rowan, North Carolina (a vast county of indefinite boundaries formed in 1753), where they formed a community called The Jersey Settlement by joining West Jersey residents who left New Jersey due to their unwillingness to adhere to the demands of Colonel Daniel Coxe, an English Colonial landowner and physician. Disgusted by Coxe's rampant political corruption, the Greene family settled near the Yadkin River in North Carolina and started the Jersey Settlement Meeting House, now on the National Historic Register. Jeremiah's family migrated to the Jersey Settlement and then to Hancock County, Tennessee, where his descendants figured prominently in the Greene‚ÄìJones War.  How the war began  The Greene-Jones war entered the annals of folklore and national myth, and it is difficult to establish a true time line and documented narrative. This is partly the case because of the name changes of both the people and the locales. By the late 1880s the Greene family and the Jones family, mostly farmers with large plots of land, had lived in the narrow mountains of Hancock County many years and had become clannish families in which kissing cousins (usually second cousins) married or in which all the many children of one local family married all the children of a neighboring family. Most of the activity of the Greene-Jones feud occurred in an area in and around what is now Claiborne County, Tennessee, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and the Pinnacle Overlook and Gap Cave in nearby Kentucky and Lee County, Virginia, and not far from the area of strife between the Hatfields and McCoys. Strife between the Greene and Jones families is said by some chroniclers to have begun even before the American Civil War when one of the Greenes' pigs crawled under the fence and onto the Jones property. A Jones killed the pig and stuffed a hole in the fence with its body. Variations on the story of the pig/hog beginnings of vengeance are many. In retribution, Richard Greene, probably not the son of Jeremiah but one of the many other descendants named Richard Greene, broke up a big iron cauldron on the Jones property with an axe. The Greene‚ÄìJones War has many similarities to the Hatfield-McCoy feud, and the feuds' beginnings due to the killing of a pig illustrate not only how much the feuds had in common but also the value of pigs and other livestock to early mountain settlers. Another cause of initial ill will between the families may have been the teasing but insulting ongoing jest carried out by the Jones boys against Susan \\"Sooki\\" Greene, the wife of Hampton \\"Hamp\\" Greene. Referring to her nickname, they would call out \\"Here Sookie, here sookee, here soookee,\\" as though calling a cow.https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1572338296 Alfred Greene, born 1827 in Hawkins County, was a reconnaissance scout during the American Civil War and did not join either the Union Army or the Army of the Confederacy. He was killed in 1863 by a gang of three bushwackers when he secretly went home to visit his wife who was expecting a baby. The gang positioned themselves around his house and shot him dead as soon as he was seen outside the house. When his brothers Robert and David, who were Union soldiers, came home after the war, they killed two of the men who had killed Alfred. The third man went insane from fear for his life.  On the Greene side  Robert D. Greene, a Union soldier and son of Richard and Jane (Trent) Greene, was born in 1841 in Hawkins County and died in 1905 in Sanger, Texas. He and his brother David were the murderers of two of the men who had killed their brother Alfred in 1863. Robert was County Clerk of Hancock County, a deputy sheriff of the county, and a wealthy farmer. According to Alton Greene, \\"When the Greene- Jones War started in full,\\" Robert ordered \\"so many guns and ammunition, it had to be shipped by box car to Rogersville, Tennessee.\\" Another in the chain of events was the death of Robert's oldest son Orlando \\"Landers\\" Greene, who was killed in the line of duty while Sheriff of Hancock County. Marshall Greene, a son of Joel and Nancy Slaton Greene, was born in 1828 in Hawkins County and, according to Alton Greene, \\"may have been a Confederate soldier\\" and \\"probably spent a year in the pen for killing someone on the Jones side.\\" Hampton \\"Hamp\\" Greene, also a son of Joel and Nancy Slaton Greene, was born 1830 in Hawkins County and married Susan Trent, the daughter of Richard and Jane (Trent) Greene. He killed James \\"Jim\\" Greene, the nephew of Larkin Greene. Hamp Greene played a large part in the Greene‚ÄìJones War. The Jones party surrounded his house one morning and riddled it with bullet holes. The Jones party allowed the women and children to come out of the house, but Mary Greene's son, who had stayed inside with the men, was killed. Two of Hampton's sons, Dick and Dan, were in prison for killing some of the Jones men, and Hampton was trying to get them released. He met with his nephew, Jim Greene (son of Larkin Greene), at the store and Luther post office, but a quarrel ensued. \\"Jim tried to kill Hamp, but instead Hamp killed Jim.\\" Hampton was never tried for the murder of his nephew. Hawkins County at that time had little official law enforcement, resorting largely to the vigilante law of the gun-toting Greene and Jones families. Richard \\"Dick\\" Greene, son of James and Lucy (Lanham) Greene, was born 1846 in Hancock County. He played a large part in the Greene‚ÄìJones War. He was called \\"the meanest man\\" in the county but appeared not to bother anyone \\"unless they messed with him first.\\" He killed Jim Jones, the son of Asa Jones, the leader of the Jones side, when Jim Jones cursed him. James Pratt and Lewis Gilbert fought Richard Greene, Link Greene, and Thomas Greene, who were brothers, and Thomas Greene was shot in one arm which had to be amputated. Lincoln \\"Link\\" Greene (1860-1942), another son of James and Lucy Lanham Greene, figured prominently in the Greene‚ÄìJones War. \\"He once dressed as a woman when the Greenes were about out of ammunition, and in disguise rode by the Jones crowd, got the needed ammunition, and rode back.\\" Later he \\"got religion\\" and a small group of his followers built a church for him. He dressed in the clothing of Biblical days. He made the coffins for himself and his wife and climbed into them to demonstrate that they were the right size for his \\"tall, thin body.\\" Greenberry Greene, son of John and Eliza (Calloway) Greene, was born 1847 in Hancock County, Tennessee. He was killed by a member of the \\"Jones Party\\" in Crab Orchard, Kentucky in the 1880s. Daniel \\"Dan\\" Greene (born 1866 in Hancock County, and died 1897 in Hancock County) was the son of Hampton and Susan (Greene) Greene. According to Alton Greene's comments, he \\"took a big part in the Greene-Jones War.\\"  On the Jones side  The wife of Robert D. Greene and the wife of Asa Jones, the Jones side leader, were related. Larkin Greene, yet another son of Joel and Nancy (Slaton) Greene, was born in 1826 in Hawkins County, Tennessee and died in Hancock County. The family of Larkin Greene was on the Jones side during the Greene‚ÄìJones War. Hampton Greene had killed Larkin's nephew, James \\"Jim\\" Greene during hostilities at the store in Luther, Tennessee. Lee C. Greene, son of Larkin and Mahalia (Trent) Greene, was born in 1855 in Hancock county. He was on the Jones side during the war, and he either died of natural causes, was injured, or was killed during the confrontations between the two families. His widow married Alexander Brewer and later Solomon Byrd.  Others who died or were injured in the Greene-Jones War  Houston Greene ( born 1841), a son of Joel and Nancy (Slaton) Greene) died during the conflict, but was not historically identified with either side. Jackson Greene (born 1846), a son of Joel and Nancy (Slaton), was a Union soldier during the Civil War. He was a drummer boy for Brownlow at one time. \\"Years later, William Gannaway Brownlow, 17th Governor of Tennessee, wrote and wanted to know what happened to little Jackson Greene.\\" Joel Greene (born 1852 in Hancock County), a son of Larkin and Mahalia (Trent) Greene, \\"played sides\\" during the Greene‚ÄìJones War. He was with Harvey Terrell at War Creek and was shot during the war by a Greene party. His arm had to be amputated.\\" Anderson Greene was the child killed in the home of his grandfather Hampton Greene, during the Greene-Jones War.\\"  The end of the war  Joseph Greene was the son of James and Lucy Lanham Greene. He was born in 1844 on a farm near the Luther post office and died in 1910 in Hancock County. He joined the Union Army and served in the Cavalry for nearly four years. He was wounded once, captured once at the Battle of Lookout Mountain, escaped and joined the army of General Sherman on his march-to-the- sea campaign. When the Greene‚ÄìJones War broke out and he was asked to take part, \\"he told his brothers that he had killed all the men he ever wanted to kill during the Civil War, and so he took no part in the Greene-Jones War.\\" To end the Greene‚ÄìJones War, the Governor of Tennessee declared martial law and sent in the Tennessee State Militia. In 1888, The Tennessean, a Nashville newspaper, reported in its front page domestic news summary that, \\"The Jones and Greene feud in Hancock County progresses. The same year, the Daily Democrat of Huntingdon, Indiana reported that the battle still raged and that both sides were heavily armed. In April of 1890, The Comet of Johnson City, Tennessee reported the murder of Thos. J. Berry, a Justice of the Peace \\"in the 19th district of this country\\" when he went to his spring just after dark to assess the damage from a storm. F. M. Burton was with Berry at the time and recognized the shooter but refused to identify him. The coroner's jury held an inquest and decided \\"that Thomas J. Berry came to his death from a pistol fired by the hands of Asa Jones.\\" Asa Jones was the leader of the Jones faction in the Greene‚ÄìJones War. In May 1890 the Rogersville Herald of Rogersville, Tennessee reported the surrender of Ace Jones. Later, with a byline from the Rogersville Herald, The Comet of Johnson City reported what was thought to be \\"the finale of the late Greene-Jones War in Hancock County.\\" The title of the article is \\"Nolle Prosequi Entered\\". This and other valuable historic newspaper resources are available in Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers, a project of the Library of Congress. Patsy Hatfield Lawson, a nationally recognized storyteller and descendant of both the Hatfield and Greene feuding families once said, \\"the one thing that distinguished these feuds from each other was that the New York Times did not report on [the Greene-Jones War] as it had in the Hatfield-McCoy feud, therefore, the Greene-Jones feud went relatively unnoticed by the rest of the world.\\" However, the NYT reported in 1893 that Hiram Church of Hancock County, a bail bondsman for W. M. Hobbs who had been under a $10,000 bond, went to Knoxville to buy good handcuffs before leaving for Texas where Hobbs had run away and just been captured after escaping from a ten-year prison sentence for the murder of Sheriff Greene. On November 27, 1902, the Alexandria Gazette in Washington, D.C. reported that Richard Green, \\"the feudist who gained notoriety . . . twelve years ago . . . committed a terrible tragedy.\\" Said to be in a \\"maudlin condition,\\" and \\"after a brief altercation,\\" shot both his wife and daughter and then himself through the heart, emptying all the chambers of his pistol.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85025007/1902-11-27/ed-1/seq-2/image_681x648_from_2618,1757_to_4862,3894.jpg?download=True  References   External links  * \\"Them's Fightin Words: Researching Feuds http://oftreesandink.blogspot.com/2015/04/thems-fightin-words- researching-feuds.html * \\"Keeping Up With the Joneses: Hawkins County History Book\\" * \\"Greene Jones War\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpsqpqhnWWI * Moonshine Feuds & Malungeons.

He is known as \\"Er Gnappa\\", which is Romanesco for \\"short person\\". Biography Vitale began his criminal career in the early 70s under boss Tiberio Cason, specializing in armed robbery, house burglary and kidnapping. He later branched out to cocaine trafficking and became affiliated with the Banda della Magliana, in particular with the boss Gianfranco Urbani. Together with Urbani he was arrested on 18 October 1975 during a meeting at a restaurant together with the top bosses of the 'Ndrangheta at the time: Paolo De Stefano, Giuseppe Piromalli and Pasquale Condello.

When the Banda della Magliana divided each neighborhood in Rome, Vitale was given control of the Ostiense-Garbatella area. After the death of Franco Giuseppucci, \\"Er Gnappa\\" was one of the many who participated in the ensuing gang war that decimated the rival Proietti Clan and several other adversaries ‚Äî including his old boss Tiberio Cason, killed in 1983 on the orders of Urbani.Federica Sciarelli, Con il Sangue agli Occhi Having risen through the ranks he became one of the closest collaborators of top boss Enrico De Pedis, leader of the faction dubbed the \\"Testaccini\\". He diversified his activities, continuing to operate in drug trafficking but also usury and handling of stolen goods, an activity through which he met Ciro Maresca, a boss for the Nuova Famiglia and brother of the more well known Pupetta Maresca, who became one of the main Camorra allies for the \\"Testaccini\\" alongside Michele Senese. He invested money into legitimate businesses (such as car dealerships and jewelry stores), without abandoning armed robbery, for which he became one of the main organizers in Rome. Vitale has been also linked to the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi: according to an informant she was kidnapped to blackmail the Vatican into returning money that Vitale and De Pedis had invested in the Banco Ambrosiano.Angela Camuso, Mai ci fu Piet√† Following the conflict at the end of the 80's which led to the death of an older generation of bosses, such as De Pedis, Edoardo Toscano and Gianni Girlando, the \\"Testaccini\\" split up into two factions: one of them led by Paolo Frau, Raffaele Pernasetti and Giorgio Paradisi, and another led by Massimo Carminati, Vitale and Enrico Nicoletti. Vitale became particularly close to Carminati and together established a monopoly on the lucrative videopoker market, while continuing to invest money in legitimate businesses. Vitale even laundered the money of A.S. Roma, the city's footcall squad, through contacts he had with some of its players and managers. Vitale and Carminati organized, on the night of 17 July 1999, a spectacular heist at the safety vault of the bank of Rome in Piazzale Clodio: despite the vault being protected by a massive gate, a group of 23 men led by Vitale opened it by simply using the standard keys, which were given to Carminati by a group of corrupt Carabinieri officers. They opened a total of 174 safe deposit boxes which resulted not only in a loot of 10 billion, but also in the theft of several sensitive documents which were kept inside and which Carminati intended to use to blackmail authorities. Although the documents were never found, after this heist Carminati was never put under investigation again for the next decade. Pernasetti and Paradisi resented Carminati's group for not having helped them during their time in prison following the repentance of former Magliana boss Maurizio Abbatino, and for not properly sharing the revenue of their activities with them. They had planned to murder them but a new wave of arrests on 2005 foiled their plans. Vitale was arrested again on 2 October 2010 in Caserta, where he was leading a group of Camorra and Banda della Magliana robbers to assault an armored truck.

Bedou (July 6, 1882 ‚Äì July 2, 1966) was an American photographer based in New Orleans. Bedou was, for a time, the personal photographer of Booker T. Washington, and documented the last decade of Washington's life. He also documented campus life at the Tuskegee Institute and the city life of New Orleans, especially the city's black residents. Booker T. Washington, New Orleans, 1915; photograph by Arthur P. Bedou. Booker T. Washington at desk, 1915; photograph by Arthur P. Bedou Biography Arthur Paul Bedou was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1882, one of five children of Armand Bedou and Marie Celeste Coustaut. His family was poor and he received very little education; as a photographer he was largely self-taught. Bedou worked for a time as a clerk, but by 1899 he was taking pictures, and his career started in earnest when a photograph he took of a solar eclipse in 1900 received wide notice. In 1903 Bedou documented a conference at Tuskegee Institute in the hope of gaining visibility for his work. Booker T. Washington saw some of his photographs and invited Bedou to accompany him as his personal photographer, preferring Bedou over other candidates like C. M. Battey in part for his ability to produce dynamic images of unfolding events. Most of Bedou's photographs of Washington were taken between 1908 and 1915, the year of Washington's death. Among other tasks, he accompanied Washington on his summer tours with the object of producing an album of each trip. To supplement his uncertain income from these travels, he had some of the photographs he took made into postcards, Christmas cards, and calendars. His position brought him further commissions to photograph notables both black and white, including George Washington Carver, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie, and Julius Rosenwald. Through the connection to Washington, who was the school's founding principal, Bedou was invited to become official photographer of the Tuskegee Institute. Shortly after Washington's death, however, he was replaced as the school's official photographer by Battey, who at the time was favored by campus officials for various reasons. He was also in demand by other black colleges and schools such as Fisk University to document life on their campuses, and by professional organizations such as the National Negro Business League, the National Medical Association, and the National Baptist Convention. In the 1920s, Bedou opened his own photography studio in New Orleans, where he photographed everything from black families and their children to the laying of the cornerstone at Corpus Christi Church to the visits of jazz bands and celebrity speakers. His photographs often appeared in both the Louisiana Weekly (a newspaper with a primarily black circulation) and the general-circulation newspaper Louisiana Times-Picayune. His photographs won several awards over the years, including the gold medal at the 1907 Jamestown Tercentennial Exposition. Bedou prospered and invested in real estate and companies like the People's Industrial Life Insurance Company of Louisiana, of which he was for many years a director and vice-president. When he died in 1966, he left much of his fortune to educational institutions, and his wife, Lillia Bedou, founded a scholarship in his honor at Xavier University of Louisiana. Since her death, the scholarship has been known as the Arthur and Lillia Bedou Scholarship. Xavier University also holds a collection of around 70 of his photographs.

She is known to posterity chiefly on account of her friendship with Goethe, who wrote about her. Life Katharina Zimmermann was born in Brugg, a small but politically significant town in the Aare Valley, then enjoying the status of a Municipality (\\"Munizipalstadt\\"), governed directly under the control of Bern in Switzerland. She was the second recorded child of Johann Georg von Zimmermann, a physician and writer. Her mother and grandmother both died of Tuberculosis in March 1771, while Katharina was still a young teenager. She was relocated to Hanover where she lived with a friend of her father's called Mrs von D√∂ring. Shortly after this she was moved again, to live with friends of her father in Minden. In May 1773 her father, who in the interim had closed down his own household, sent her on to Lausanne, accompanied by a request to father's friend and colleague, Samuel-Auguste Tissot, that he do everything necessary to provide her with a complete upbringing (einer \\"vollkommenen Education\\"), even if the cost should exceed the budgeted annual amount of 400 Thalers. Moving to Lausanne instantly provided Katharina with four new sisters. Along with the Tissot sisters, the household already included a girl from Poland. In March 1775 Zimmermann removed his daughter to Bern where she moved in with the Haller family. There is speculation that she had acquired a boyfriend in Lausanne of whom he disapproved. Two months later, in May 1775, he decided to reclaim his daughter. Together they traveled to Hanover, arriving on 5 October 1771. Along the way, between 22 and 27 September,Robert Steiger: Goethes Leben von Tag zu Tag : eine dokumentarische Chronik. Band 1. 1749‚Äì1775. Artemis, Z√ºrich 1982, p. 750‚Äì752. Zimmermann and his daughter stayed as guest of the Goethe family in Frankfurt.Karl Goedeke: Zur Chronologie und Biographie Goethes, In: Bl√§tter f√ºr literarische Unterhaltung, Vol 2, F. A. Brockhaus, 1857, p. 913ff. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was 26 at this time: his engagement to Lili Sch√∂nemann was about to be broken off by Lili Sch√∂nemann's mother, ostensibly due to the differing religious backgrounds of the parties. He wrote to his friend Johann Caspar Lavater on 28 September 1775 that, \\"his daughter is not closed off, but only holding back, and she has left the door slightly ajar...\\" (\\"Seine Tochter ist so in sich, nicht verriegelt nur zur√ºckgetreten ist sie, und hat die Th√ºre leis angelehnt\\"). Zimmermann had taken himself off to the Wetterau countryside for a couple of days on 27 September, leaving his daughter behind with Goethe's mother's house, and Goethe found the opportunity to study Katharina more closely, and recording what he saw: \\"Thin and fully formed, she steps out with confidence: her regularly structured facial features would be attractive if she would only take a little trouble to do something with it.\\" (\\"Schlank und wohlgewachsen, trat sie auf ohne Zierlichkeit, ihr regelm√§√üiges Gesicht w√§re angenehm gewesen, wenn sich ein Zug von Teilnahme darin aufgetan h√§tte\\") For Goethe 1775 was important for another reason. In November he left the family home in Frankfurt, relocating to Weimar in order to take a post with Karl August of Saxe-Weimar. Much later Goethe wrote about Katharina's visit in the autobiographical work covering his early years, \\"Dichtung und Wahrheit\\". He wrote that Katharina had confided to his mother (\\"Frau Aja\\") that she had no wish to trail around after her father any more. She would rather live as a slave or a maid in the Goethe household than be exposed to her father's harsh tyranny. \\"Frau Aja\\" had discussed the matter with Goethe, suggesting he might marry Katharina. A marriage with a noble purpose was a not uncommon thing among the Frankfurt bourgeois families, but Goethe lashed out: \\"If we were discussing an orphan ... it would be worth considering and pursuing, but God preserve me from a father-in-law like that!\\" Goethe's biographer, Karl Goedeke, cast serious doubt on Goethe's version of events, bearing in mind Zimmermann's attitude to his \\"adored daughter\\" (\\"z√§rtlich geliebten Tochter\\").Karl Goedeke: Goethe und Schiller, Reprint der Ausgabe von 1859, Salzwasserverlag, 2012, p. 35. Goedeke contends that the marriage idea from Frau Goethe was a non-starter because Katharina was still in love with a man she had met when living in Lausanne, and that her thwarted lover committed suicide the next year. Katharina continued to Hanover with her father. Here, in December 1775, she rejected a marriage proposal to a \\"well placed\\" young man, even though his proposal was supported by her father. She thought him a \\"petit-ma√Ætre\\" (\\"poser\\"). By 1780 she had returned to live with her father's Hanover friend, Mrs von D√∂ring. Here, on 31 December 1780, she suffered a serious bleeding which was a symptom of the Tuberculosis that had already killed her mother and grandmother. Katharina von Zimmermann died on 10 September 1780 in the presence of her father. Johann Georg Zimmermann also attended his daughter's autopsy, and by sufficiently observing the marks on her lungs, satisfied himself as to the cause of her death.Markus Zenker: Therapie im literarischen Text: Johann Georg Zimmermanns Werk ¬ª√úber die Einsamkeit¬´ in seiner Zeit, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, note 155 on p. 49. The original Mignon? Writing in 1900, Alfons Matthes believed that he had discovered in Katharine von Zimmermann the inspiration for Mignon, a character in Goethe's second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship.Alfons Matthes: Mignon, Goethes Herz : ein Seelenaufschluss in drei Teilen, Herzensaufschluss, Dichtungsaufschluss, und Lebensaufschluss, Schkeuditz-Leipzig, W.

Mirabaud provides services in wealth management, asset management and brokerage to private clients and institutions around the world. History Mirabaud et Cie was founded in 1819 and is one of the oldest banks in Switzerland. Family-owned and operated, the bank has played a key part in the construction and development of the Swiss financial system, helping co- found the Geneva Stock Exchange in 1857. In 1973, it pioneered the development of Swiss hedge funds. In 1985, Mirabaud opened its first foreign bureau in Montr√©al, followed in 1990 by the reinforcement of its historical presence in London The first Asian office was opened in Hong Kong in 1997 and one year later, the bank reinforced its presence in Switzerland by opening its first subsidiary in Zurich. In 2001, Mirabaud significantly grows its asset management teams in Geneva and London. The same year, the Group creates LPP Gestion SA to operate in the field of liability management services for pension funds. From 2003 onwards the Group continues to solidify its presence in the EU, Switzerland, and the Middle East: a new subsidiary opens in Paris, a majority stake in Jenni & Cie (Basel) is purchased in 2004, and another banking office opens in Dubai in 2007. In 2010, the Group acquires Venture Finanzas in Spain and pursues its strategic implantation by opening offices in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Seville. In 2011, Mirabaud consolidates its asset management activities in Luxembourg by creating Mirabaud Asset Management (Europe) SA. A bank (Mirabaud & Cie (Europe) SA) follows in 2014. In 2015, the Group announces the acquisition of two further banking licenses in Spain and France. The group undergoes a major structural change in 2014: Mirabaud's activities become integrated into Mirabaud SCA, a Swiss corporate partnership. For the first time the Groupe also publishes its annual results. Activities Mirabaud‚Äôs headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland, but the Group has offices around the world. These include subsidiaries in Switzerland (Geneva, Basel, Zurich), Europe (London, Luxembourg, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and Milan), and elsewhere around the globe (Montreal, Hong Kong, and Dubai amongst others. The Group concentrates on three main divisions: wealth management, asset management, and brokerage. Sponsorship Mirabaud is since 2005 the main sponsor of the Bol d‚ÄôOr Mirabaud ‚Äì the longest fresh water sailboat regatta in Europe that is held annually on Lake Geneva. In 2019, to celebrate its 200th anniversary the bank made the Geneva Museum of Modern Arts free to all visitors.

Evoked by the approach of The Chinese Road, and despite feeble cooperation from the Royal Lao Government, the Thai military established a three-battalion presence on Lao territory south of the Mekong River as a defense against potential invasion by the People's Republic of China. Overview In January 1962, during the beginning of the Laotian Civil War, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma struck a foreign aid pact with the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communist Chinese would build roads in northwestern Laos despite the ongoing Laotian Civil War. As part of this project, in the wake of the defeat at Nam Bac on 14 January 1968, Chinese engineers began building Route 46 from Yunnan Province south down the Nam Beng Valley towards Pakbeng, which was located on the Mekong River. As the road construction neared the Thai border, and was guarded by Chinese troops and antiaircraft guns, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) became concerned about the possibility of both a Chinese invasion and Chinese support for the Communist Party of Thailand.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 315-318.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 238-239.Stuart-Fox, p. 56. Background Lao Auto Defense Choc (ADC) militia were stationed in two villages near Route 46, Ban Houei Lao and Ban Moung. During Spring 1971, Pathet Lao (PL) troops associated with the road construction effort drove the ADC militia from these villages. The militiamen fled south across the Mekong River and the Thai border. In turn, the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) flew tactical air strike missions to support the reoccupation of those village outposts. Activities On 2 April 1971, the Royal Thai Army (RTA) began a three-week-long military offensive sweep along its Mekong River border with the Kingdom of Laos. The Thais deployed an infantry regiment, a paratroop battalion, and two artillery batteries, all supported by tactical air power from the RTAF. As Operation Phalat (Operation Mountain Slope) was scheduled as a joint exercise, Lao artillery and Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) were pledged by the Royal Lao Government (RLG), but never showed. Some Lao ADC did appear on the Lao side of the boundary. In the event, RTG forces destroyed a CPT insurgent base camp in their territory and cut several infiltration trails across the border.Conboy, Morrison, p. 318. Though these results were satisfactory to the Thais, they were anxious to extend their defensive zone into the southern edge of Military Region 1. As they already had the Operation Unity program for supplying mercenary \\"volunteers\\" to support the RLG on the Plain of Jars, they proposed stationing some of those troops as a blocking force between The Chinese Road and the Thai/Lao border. On 15 June 1971, three battalions of Unity troops were stationed at Xieng Lom, Laos. They were dubbed Task Force Rattikone. Due to their crucial location, they were handpicked from the finest Thai troops, and led by a West Point graduate and seasoned combat veterans of the Vietnam War.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 318-319. On 20 August 1971, Bataillion Commando 612 (BC 612) swept northwestward to the top of Phou Phine, 19 kilometers from Xieng Lom. Once there, they were bloodied in combat after overcoming ammunition shortages for their mortars and recoilless rifles.Conboy, Morrison, p. 319. Result Operation Phalat had succeeded in implanting three Thai battalions in a forward position on Lao soil at Xieng Lom. In the near future, the \\"mountain slope\\" would lead to an operation named after a mythical Thai warrior Operation Sourisak Montry. Notes References * Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R.

Reports of cat deaths attributed to the killer were spread across and around Greater London, and as far north as Manchester. However, in 2018 the Metropolitan Police concluded that the mutilations had not been carried out by a human and were likely caused by wildlife predation or scavenging on cats killed in vehicle collisions. Some experts, such as Richard Ward, a lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the University of Exeter, have stated the view that the Croydon Cat Killer case is an example of a moral panic. In December 2018 a Freedom of Information request detailed that the Metropolitan Police spent over ¬£130,000 and 2,250 hours during their investigation. Investigation In October 2015 South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (SNARL), a small local group of animal welfare activists based in South Norwood, reported incidents of cat mutilation to the police and RSPCA. That November, the Metropolitan Police began to investigate the mutilations, under the name \\"Operation Takahe\\" and led by Detective Sergeant Andy Collin. In January 2016 it was reported that 30,000 local people signed a petition requesting the police conduct DNA testing of the corpses. By February 2016, the deaths of 10 cats (four in Croydon and one each in Streatham, Mitcham Common, Sutton, Charlton, Peckham and Finchley) had been linked by an examining vet who wished to remain anonymous. However, the police at this time said the number of cases was in single digits In February 2016 it was reported that police had yet to find any evidence that the animals were deliberately killed by a human. At this time an investigating vet stated that he found raw chicken in the stomachs of several killed cats and suggested the animals had probably been lured by the killer with the offer of meat. In March 2016, Det. Sgt. Collin said that the perpetrator might be only mutilating the corpses after the animals had already died and might only face charges relating to public order or theft . He noted that of the six cases being investigated, five of the cats had not been claimed which would make it difficult to bring charges of theft or criminal damage. As of March 2016, no human DNA had been recovered. In April 2016 it was reported that the RSPCA believed that the deaths were due to blunt trauma, ‚Äúlikely consistent with being hit by a moving vehicle‚Äù. SNARL claimed that the animals were killed deliberately, perhaps by being thrown against a wall. By April 2016, SNARL had recorded 50 attacks across Crystal Palace, Mitcham, Streatham, Peckham, Charlton, Richmond, Orpington, and Farnborough in southern Greater London, Finchley, Tottenham and Archway in north London, Stepney in the east, and Guildford in Surrey. SNARL reported that other animals including foxes and rabbits have been attacked in the same way. In June 2016, SNARL speculated that there had been 100 kills following a decapitated cat being found in Morden. At this time police stated that they had spent 1,020 hours on the inquiry since December 2015. By July 2016, the media and SNARL had begun referring to the attacker as the \\"M25 Cat Killer\\" after new reports, including a cat killed in Whyteleafe, Surrey, suggested the killer was operating around the M25 motorway. After reports of animal deaths in Maidstone, Sevenoaks and seven other locations, SNARL adopted the terms \\"M25 Animal Killer\\" and \\"UK Cat Killer\\". Det. Sgt. Collin, speaking in 2017 about a possible motive stated ‚ÄúCats are targeted because they are associated with the feminine... The killer can't deal with a woman or women who are troubling him‚Äù. He added that he was worried that ‚Äúat some stage he'll escalate or feel brave enough to move on to vulnerable women and girls.‚Äù Vince Egan, associate professor of forensic psychology at the University of Nottingham has said: ‚ÄúIn some individuals we have seen animal cruelty as part of a broader pattern in which humans are also harmed. It is far more likely that this reflects a rather more banal pattern of anti-social behaviour, such as drunkenness or something that doesn‚Äôt go further. But when we have so little to go on you have to keep your mind open.‚Äù In September 2017, ArroGen Veterinary Forensics began re-examining some animals to help the police and RSPCA to bring prosecutions. In October 2017 it was reported that the killer was suspected of mutilating over 370 animals. Det. Sgt. Collin stated that it was possible there were copycats. In December 2017, police linked five cat deaths around Northampton from August to November that year to the same killer, but later police stated the Northampton deaths were not being linked to the others, though a 31-year-old man had been arrested. It was reported in August 2018 that, three years after the first report of the Croydon Cat Killer, no evidence relating to an individual who may be committing the alleged crimes had been found. There was no evidence found of clothing, human DNA or a murder weapon and no CCTV footage had been recovered. In September 2018, the Metropolitan Police reported that in three instances where CCTV footage was obtained, foxes could be seen carrying bodies or body-parts of cats. In one case, CCTV showed a fox carrying a cat's head into a school playground at Catford. In post-mortem examinations conducted by the Head of Veterinary Forensic Pathology at the Royal Veterinary College, fox DNA was found on the cats' bodies. The Met closed the investigation on 20 September, saying foxes mutilating the bodies of cats that had died in road traffic accidents was the most likely explanation.Croydon cat killer unmasked: Met Police reveal culprits after three year probe and 500 deaths... are foxes, Evening Standard, September 20, 2018. By Justin Davenport.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/20/croydon-cat-killer- unmasked-after-three-year-investigation Reactions In February 2016, the animal rights charity PETA offered a ¬£5,000 reward (raised from an initial ¬£2,000 in December 2015) to anyone providing information to the police that leads to the arrest and conviction of the serial cat killer (or killers). Public figures local to Croydon such as Martin Clunes, Dermot O'Leary and Caroline Flack used their social media accounts to raise awareness of the case in the hope it would lead to an arrest. In an email to Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, actor Clunes wrote, \\"As someone who shares my home with several four-legged companions I read with horror that some of the cats had been decapitated, disemboweled or dismembered ‚Äì this is the stuff of nightmares.\\" In May 2018, Vice Media released a half-hour documentary about the purported cat killer and SNARL. The cases were featured in The Met: Policing London - Series 2, Episode 4. In September 2018, about 20,000 people signed a petition opposing the closure of the case. In January 2019, the Observer reported that according to Snarl some Metropolitan police officers and vets continued to believe that at least one human was attacking cats and other animals, citing what they said were clean cuts, body parts being later returned, and a case of cat mutilation in Northampton that resulted in a conviction.  Scepticism  In July 2018, Stephen Harris, retired professor of environmental sciences at the University of Bristol, who had studied fox behaviour for 50 years, wrote an article in New Scientist. He asserted that there is no \\"killer\\", and the pattern of blunt-force trauma, followed by removal of the head and tail once the blood has congealed, is consistent with road traffic accidents combined with scavenging by foxes. In the 1990s, there was a similar panic following the discovery of dozens of cat deaths in Greater London. The RSPCA sought Harris's advice at this time. Those events led to the Metropolitan Police opening Operation Obelisk in 1998. However, they dropped the case in 1999 after Harris inspected several cat carcasses. He concluded that they had been killed by cars and mutilated by foxes. Harris stated: ‚ÄúWe have known for decades that foxes chew the head or tail off carcasses, including dead cats‚Äù. Parallels have been drawn between the Croydon Cat Killer and moral panics, in which public fear and lurid headlines amplify perceptions of danger, which puts pressure on authorities to act. Richard Ward, lecturer and historian of crime and the reporting of crime at the University of Exeter, has stated that the creation of Operation Takahe appears to be the result of such a moral panic.

Operation Phalat established a base camp at Xieng Lom, Laos, on the southern bank of the Mekong River, and garrisoned it with three Thai mercenary battalions. Operation Sourisak Montry was a series of indecisive skirmishes in the same area, during which the Thais won a Pyrrhic victory over the Pathet Lao in mid-March 1972. Subsequently, Operation Sourisak Montry VIII in June 1972 attempted to recapture two Lao border villages from Communist forces. The offensive ended poorly, with an Air America civilian pilot killed, an 80-man column pinned down for ten days, and the Thai troops repulsed. Overview Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma made a foreign aid pact with the People's Republic of China in January 1962. The Chinese Communists committed to construct roads from Yunnan Province into the Kingdom of Laos. When the Royal Lao Government (RLG) lost the crucial Battle of Nam Bac during the Laotian Civil War, the Chinese began to push their road construction south down the Pakbeng Valley towards Thailand. As the new Route 46 was cleared toward Pakbeng, the Chinese stationed 400 antiaircraft guns and 25,000 troops along it. When the new road hit Pakbeng, only the Mekong River and a strip of Lao territory on the south bank separated the road's end from Thai ground. The Royal Thai Government (RTG) began to worry about the Chinese supplying the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) or even invading Thailand.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 315-318.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 238-239.Stuart- Fox, p. 56. Background RTG uneasiness about The Chinese Road led them to sponsor a border sweep called Operation Phalat (translated: Mountain Slope). Launched on 2 April 1971, it resulted in the Royal Thai Army (RTA) establishing a forward defensive zone centered on Xieng Lom, Laos. The three battalions of Project Unity troops stationed there during August were dubbed Task Force Rattikone. However, the Thais remained uneasy about their nation's borders.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 318-319. Operation Sourisak Montry The Thais then planned a follow-up offensive named after a legendary Thai warrior Sourisak Montry. In September 1971, three battalions of the RTA recaptured several positions on the south bank of the Mekong opposite Pakbeng. Although these strongholds were on Lao territory rather than Thai, their occupation restored the Mekong's natural geographic divide between Laos and Thailand.Conboy, Morrison, p. 319. The sector remained quiet for some months. Then, in Spring 1972, the Thais established two new positions on the Mekong's south bank, and emplaced a pair of 75mm howitzers. Communist forces crossed the river and assaulted the new fire bases for six days and seven nights, using new and undetectable plastic land mines. When Air America tried to medevac Thai wounded on 20 March 1972, one of their H-34s was downed 12 kilometers southwest of the siege.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 319-320. The following day, a Unity battalion was heli-lifted in to secure the Air America helicopter. From that landing zone, they moved northeast and relieved the two besieged trenchworks. The new battalion remained in place until 15 May, when a fresh mercenary battalion replaced them.Conboy, Morrison, p. 320. The replacement battalion was soon attacked by an estimated 500 Pathet Lao (PL). For seven days, tactical air strikes hit the attacking communists; AC-47 gunships and Thai UH-1M armed helicopters strafed them, and A-1 Skyraiders and T-28 Trojans bombed and rocketed them. The PL finally retreated from the effort. However, the Thais withdrew afterwards because they considered the positions could not be maintained. Operation Sourisak Montry VIII In early June 1972, 100 CPT insurgents penetrated into Laos and captured a pair of Lao border villages 45 kilometers northwest of Xieng Lom. A joint response by Thailand and Laos was planned. The Thais committed their 7th Regimental Combat Team (7th RCT); the Lao delegated some of their Thai mercenaries to form two assault columns. However, the pincer movement came apart as the Thais attacked in a prolonged pouring rain. After taking casualties for several days, the 7th RCT unexpectedly retreated. The CPT insurgents then turned their recoilless rifles and mortars on the mercenaries. One Thai mercenary column withdrew. The CPT managed to surround the other detachment of 80 men. A Special Forces rescue team of 70 was infiltrated from the Mekong, with a 75mm pack howitzer and a 4.2 inch mortar. With indirect fire support from the howitzer and mortar, a medevac was tried on 12 June 1972. The Air America civilian copilot was killed by a bullet in the head, and the medevac aborted. The Thai mercenaries were trapped for ten days before their rescuers linked up and led them back to the improvised fire base. The Communists followed suit. Both Air America and the U.S. Air Force were loath to attempt an exfiltration because of potential ground fire. At that point, the Thai commander on scene parachuted into the fire base to show there was no ground fire. The 22nd Special Operations Squadron then lifted out troops and guns to end the operation. Result The arrival of an entire Chinese regiment at Moung Sai on Route 46 in March 1971 had been a troubling omen. So were several incidents during December 1971 and January 1972, when aircraft flying near the new Route 46 were fired upon by antiaircraft artillery. Though officially not at war with Communist China, the RTG had demonstrated their willingness to defend Thai borders by waging Operations Phalat and Sourisak Montry VIII.

It is the successor to the Microsoft Lumia 640 and is aimed primarily at business users, with support for Microsoft's business applications as well as security features like device encryption and remote wiping. Due to hardware limitations, it does not support Continuum. The phone was available in both single- and dual-SIM variants and is the most recent model in the Lumia series, with Microsoft discontinuing mobile hardware production the following year.  Availability  In the United Kingdom, the Lumia 650 is available from EE, O2 and Vodafone. In the United States, the Lumia 650 is available from Cricket Wireless. In Canada, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, the Lumia 650 was available unlocked from the Microsoft Store.  Hardware  The Lumia 650 has a 5-inch pentile OLED display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection and oleophobic (fingerprint- resistant) coating. It is powered by a 1.3 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal storage with up to 200 GB expandable storage via microSD cards. It has a removable 2000 mAh Li-Ion battery, 8 megapixel rear camera with LED flash and 5 megapixel wide-angle front-facing camera. It was available in black and white. Unlike its predecessor, the Lumia 650 is built with an anodized metal frame design, which gives it a distinctive premium look and feel compared to its high-end siblings, the Microsoft Lumia 950 and Microsoft Lumia 950 XL.  Software  The Lumia 650 originally launched with the Windows 10 Mobile November Update (also known as Version 1511). In August 2016, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update (also known as Windows 10 Mobile Version 1607). The rollout of the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update (Version 1703) began on April 25, 2017, following a rollout to Windows Insiders.  Reception  Back of the Lumia 650 (black version) The Lumia 650 was generally well-received, with most reviewers commending the design, display quality and low price. The main points of criticism were performance and stability. Richard Devine of Windows Central praised the design of the Lumia 650, calling it \\"easily the best looking Lumia in the current lineup\\". While some performance problems were noted, especially in graphically intensive games, overall usability for everyday tasks was found to be acceptable. The reviewer also noted a number of bugs in Windows 10 Mobile, but most of those were fixed in a subsequent operating system update. Steve Litchfield of All About Windows Phone gave the Lumia 650 a score of 83%, regarding it as a considerable upgrade from the Lumia 550, but expressing disappointment at the low-end Snapdragon 212 chipset. The phone was compared favourably to the Lumia 830, with the reviewer noting that it's \\"the nicest feeling Windows Phone I've ever held\\" and concluding that it's \\"the perfect smartphone to hand out in companies\\". Rich Woods of Neowin gave the Lumia 650 a very favourable review, calling it \\"a budget device that punches well above its weight\\". The design was described as \\"stunning\\" and the display was said to have \\"vibrant colors and deep blacks\\". The reviewer also commended camera performance, noting the lack of 1080p video capture as the only drawback. Overall performance was found to be excellent considering the price tag, with idle battery life being the main point of criticism. GSMArena commended the design as \\"gorgeous\\" and described the phone as feeling \\"almost unnaturally light\\", while also praising the display's sunlight legibility and colour accuracy. The review also noted multiple performance and stability issues with Windows 10 Mobile and pointed out Continuum and Windows Hello as significant missing features. Alastair Stevenson of Trusted Reviews criticised the performance and described the camera as \\"uninspired\\", but considered the design and display to be better than most affordable smartphones. The reviewer also remarked that \\"for business users the Lumia 650 ticks all the right boxes\\". Katharine Byrne of IT Pro gave the phone two stars out of five, calling it \\"A Windows 10 phone that entirely misses the point of Windows 10\\" due to the lack of Continuum, and criticising the phone's performance in benchmarks. While the design and display were commended, overall verdict for the phone was \\"rather forgettable\\". Phone Arena commended the phone's design, build quality and camera performance, but noted a few issues with the out-of-the-box experience as well as the camera. Overall the phone was deemed \\"a solid choice for an entry-level Windows 10 handset\\". Tom Warren of The Verge praised the phone's high-end look and aluminum feel as well as its light weight. However, he found many drawbacks such as an underpowered processor and the lack of Continuum.

Schneider was the composer, conductor, and co-producer of the autobiographical work. The title comes from the Minnesota farm where she was raised. The Thompson Fields comes with over fifty pages of liner notes containing photographs, drawings, and Schneider's thoughts about nature. Critical reception In Stereo Review magazine, music critic Fred Kaplan called the album a masterpiece and ranked Schneider with big band composers Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, and Gil Evans, adding that she worked as an assistant to Evans and Bob Brookmeyer early in her career. Critic Kevin Whitehead of NPR praised the album, though he said the album's grandeur could get \\"too purple\\". At All About Jazz, Dan Bilawsky called the album \\"awe-inspiring\\". He said that the quotation from Theodore Roosevelt on the liner notes fits much of Schneider's music: \\"'There is nothing more practical in the end than the preservation of beauty, than the preservation of anything that appeals to the higher emotions in mankind.'\\" In The New York Times, Nate Chinen wrote that she is borrowing methods used by Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis but that she has her own way of \\"using timbre and harmony to bring a tactile presence to the dimensions of sound.\\" Chinen added that her orchestra planned to perform this pastoral composition at the Birdland club in New York City. Doug Ramsey at Arts Journal called The Thompson Fields a suite because of \\"its unity of style and its mood of reflection.\\" In the UK, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph comments on the importance of the liner notes, the bird paintings by Audubon, and how the music mimics the Minnesota landscape's \\"quality of being both huge and intimate.\\" At The Guardian, John Fordham commented that, although The Thompson Fields is reflective, it also swings.

The act was interpreted as a failed attempt on the life of Carlist General Jos√© Enrique Varela, the Minister of War.  History  In early August 1942 at the end of a funeral for fallen Carlists in the Spanish Civil War celebrated at the church of San Vicente de Abando in Bilbao, shouts were heard against the Falangists. A Falangist \\"old shirt\\" from Bilbao considered it a provocation and asked the Deputy Secretary of the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista, Jos√© Luna Mel√©ndez ‚Äì a Falangist close to \\"El Cu√±ad√≠simo\\" Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er ‚Äì to organize a response since on August 15 there was to be a Carlist commemoration of their fallen at the Basilica of Bego√±a in Bilbao which would be presided over by the Minister of Defense, General Varela.Su√°rez Fern√°ndez, Luis (2011), Franco. Los a√±os decisivos. 1931‚Äì1945. Ariel, Barcelona, pp. 221‚Äì224. (Spanish) On the eve of the celebration, the Commander of the Falangist militia of Bilbao informed his Regional Head, based in Burgos, that among the attendees at Bego√±a would be Basque nationalists disguised in Carlist uniform with weapons ready to provoke an incident. That same day, August 14, \\"after having received instructions\\", Eduardo Ber√°stegui, the Head of the Sindicato Espa√±ol Universitario (SEU) of Biscay, and an \\"old shirt\\" named Hernando Calleja Calleja left Valladolid. In San Sebasti√°n they picked up Juan Jos√© Dom√≠nguez Mu√±oz who, like Calleja, had just returned from the Eastern Front where they fought with the Blue Division. They returned to Bilbao during the early morning of August 15. The mass in honour of the fallen Carlists began at 11:30 a.m. at the Basilica of Bego√±a. At the end of the ceremony, the Falangists began to rebuke the attendees who responded with cried of \\"Long Live the King!\\", \\"Down with State Socialism!\\" and \\"Death to Franco!\\" and suddenly Juan Jos√© Dom√≠nguez threw two bombs which caused a number of injuries and which almost reached General Varela. Dom√≠nguez and his accomplices were detained and General Varela immediately informed Franco of the events. He also called Minister of the Interior Valent√≠n Galarza Morante to demand surrender of the detainees to the military courts to be subject to a summary court-martial. At the same time he sent a note to the eight Captaincy General in which he said the attacks were against the army. The Falangist Ministers Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er and Jos√© Luis Arrese, who were on vacation, returned immediately to Madrid and there, together with Jos√© Antonio Gir√≥n, also a Falangist Minister, tried to prevent the conviction and execution of the detainees and downplayed the incident. They sent their own representative to Bilbao. In the meantime, Franco continued his vacation in Galicia as if nothing had happened and did not react until August 24, nine days after the attack. That day he called General Varela by telephone who told him there had been an attack against him and only luck saved him from death to which Franco responded: \\"Everything is to be done with great fairness, because in the case of a provocation things will vary\\". Of the eight Falangists involved in Bego√±a, Dom√≠nguez and Calleja were condemned to death. On July 15 Calleja's sentence was commuted. Dom√≠nguez however was shot. Francisco Franco used the incident at Bego√±a to unseat the Falangists from power, including his brother-in-law Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er, Foreign Minister, Valent√≠n Galarza Morante, Minister of the Interior, and General Jos√© Enrique Varela, Minister of Defense. He also removed Head of the Falangist militia, Jos√© Luna Mel√©ndez, despite having declared his loyalty to General√≠simo. His replacement was Manuel Mora Figueroa.

She and her lesbian partner co-wrote poems, stories and songs under the joint pseudonym Carbet, which left them free to explore sensitive topics, usually forbidden to women. She won several literary prizes from French cultural organizations. Early life Louise Eug√©nie Anna Marie-Magdeleine, who went by Anna, was born on 25 August 1902, in Ducos on the island of Martinique to In√®s (called Aya) and Eug√®ne Marie-Magdeleine. At the time, the island was a French colony and her father was born within the first decade after slavery was abolished. His family surname had been Constantin and throughout his life he and his wife were referred to as Mssr. and Mme. Constantin colloquially, though officially, after his marriage, his surname was Marie-Magdeleine. After finishing her primary schooling in her home village, Marie-Magdeleine attended school in Fort-de-France on scholarship, earning her secondary school diplomas at the age of seventeen. In 1923, Marie-Magdeleine left for Paris to continue her education. Primarily, she studied for the next four years at the University of Paris to earn her teaching credentials for vocational education (), which included courses in domestic science, dressmaking and handicrafts, but she also took courses in art at the School of Fine Arts, journalism, and law. Completing her studies in 1928, she returned to Martinique and taught in the Fort-de-France Girls' Secondary School () until 1935. Soon after her return to Martinique, Marie-Magdeleine began a twenty-five year relationship with a divorc√©e, variously reported as Olympe Claude or Claude Tricot. The women adopted the surname Carbet and openly lived together as a lesbian couple and family with Claude's son, Peter. The pseudonym Carbet, was taken from the name of the Le Carbet district of Martinique and was a tangible representation of their identification with their homeland. Claude was a fellow teacher, and the two co-wrote poems, stories, and songs under their shared surname. The adoption of the pseudonym allowed Carbet to write about issues usually forbidden to women and discuss issues, such as marginalization, race and sexuality. In 1935, Carbet returned to France to teach. While there, she participated in a variety of cultural activities: publishing articles, critiques and essays, in such journals as Droit et Libert√©, associated with MRAP, ; broadcasting a performance over Radio France from the Eiffel Tower; participating in clubs; and establishing the first black Caribbean theatre in Paris in 1937 with Claude. In 1938, they staged a play, Dans sa case which they co-wrote, at the Salle Jean Goujon, which was one of the first productions solely created and produced by blacks in Paris. Ironically, though Paulette Nardal was Carbet's sister-in-law, there is no evidence that Carbet participated in the N√©gritude movement associated with Nardal in the 1930s. In 1939, she was chosen by Georges Mandel of the French Overseas ministry to collect folklore in Martinique. Soon after she left France, the Germans invaded, the country surrendered, and Philippe P√©tain was appointed Prime Minister of France. Mandel's vocal opposition of the Nazi regime resulted in his arrest and because Carbet had been appointed by Mandel, she was barred from returning to France and her folklore mission was cancelled. She returned to the Girls' Secondary School to teach, but was removed from that post in 1940 by government representatives. In 1941, Carbet opened a private school, teaching English and dressmaking and providing tutoring, on Lamartine Street in Fort-de-France. After four years, she closed the school and with Claude, opened a book store, Cit√© du Livre, on Schoelcher Street, which they operated until 1957, when their relationship dissolved. In 1957, Carbet returned alone to France, and began her most productive literary period over the next decade. Between 1957 and 1970, she served on the editorial board and national council of the Movement against Racism and for Friendship among People () and produced newspaper articles and six volumes of poetry. She continued with radio broadcasting, as well as speaking at lectures and conferences, to promote the culture of the French Antilles. After 1970, Carbet switched her literary activity toward Canada, publishing with Lem√©ac in Montreal and participating with the Association of Catholic Writers through 1984. In 1988, Carbet returned to Fort-de-France and lived with her sister Mathilde. Death and legacy Carbet died on 10 January 1996 in Fort-de-France. She was awarded the Literary Prize for the Caribbean in 1970 for Rose de ta gr√¢ce and the ADELF Critical Prize in 1975. Both awards were given by the Association of French- Speaking Writers (). Carbet was awarded the Grand Prix Humanitaire de France for service to arts and letters for her overall body of work.

Page: 3 =Criminal cases= Moorer was also frequently employed as a defense attorney. In the late 1900s, he worked with John Adams, Sr, another black lawyer. In 1908, Adams and Moorer defended Handy Gloster who was convicted of the murder of a representative of his landlord, Nathan Garrick who attacked Gloster with a pistol in front of the Constable, but who ended up dead.Orangeburg Criminal Court All Jury Cases Completed in Eight Days - Satisfactory Record of Convictions.

Sanders was found guilty by the all-white jury, but the conviction was thrown out on appeal by the State appellate court due to an admission by a juror that he was prejudiced against black lawyers. =Pink Franklin= In 1907-1910, Adams and Moorer served as the defence for Pink Franklin in a case that went to the Supreme Court. Franklin killed a white constable who came to his house to arrest him. Moorer and Adams challenged the racial composition of the grand and petit juries and the constitutionality of South Carolina's 1895 Constitution. They lost his case at all levels, and this case was the second time black South Carolina lawyers had appeared before the Supreme Court. The case received national attention and finally in 1919, Franklin sentence was commuted and he was released on parole due to the continued efforts of Moorer and Adams, but also the efforts of Booker T. Washington, Oswald Garrison Villard, Joel Elias Spingarn, Frances Blascoer, Bernard Hagood, and Claude Sawyer.Hine, William C.

From November 2012, it premiered on TV Multimedia and Carousel. On October 14, 2013, it began broadcasting on the channel STS. The series was developed with the financial support of the Government of Moscow, and since 2011 with the support of Film Foundation. It is based around a small comic book from 2005 that eventually made it into a small music video in 2007, and eventually into a full-fledged cartoon in 2011, Qumi-Qumi tells of three different tribes: the magic-based tribal Juma-Qumi, the science-based capitalist Yumi-Qumi, and the militaristic and communistic Schumi-Qumi. Three young outcasts of each tribe, Juga, Yusi, and Shumadan, manage to break out of their social norms and become close friends. The speech of the characters is a gibberish language known as Tarabar (though with its own specific words) peppered with various English phrases. Many plots relate around Juga and Shumadan‚Äôs crushes on Yusi and trying to interact with their respective tribes despite their own faults. Plot summary Qumi-Qumi is a comedy animated series for kids ages 8‚Äì12. The prototypes of Qumi-Qumi were created in 2005 for a comic strip festival. In 2007, a short cartoon music video with dancing Qumi-Qumi characters in it gained high popularity online with 5 million viewings. Synopsis The amazing world of Qumi-Qumi in which the show is set bears a remote resemblance to Earth, however, its flora and fauna hold far more fanciful traits. The Qumi world consists of three tribes which live separately: those are the Yumi-Qumi (technology-focused people modeled on modern America), Jumi-Qumi (shamanistic and rustic, roughly based on tribal African societies) and Schumi-Qumi (militaristic and resembling Soviet Russia). Juga, Yusi and Shumadan come from different tribes but get on much better with each other than with their co- tribesmen (who consider them weirdos). In every episode one of the three friends runs into trouble all of them need to clear it up. The fact that both Juga and Shumadan are in love with Yusi doesn't make the situation any easier. The series lacks dialogue, the characters speak the simple constructed Qumi language with words mostly based on words from Toki Pona, English and Russian, as well as some words and phrases from popular culture. Dynamic plots, crazy adventures and beautiful animation make up for the terseness of the series. The series is set in an abstract reality. Qumi-Qumi world bears a slight resemblance to Earth reality; however it is notable for fanciful and colorful landscapes and fantastical creatures living in them. Background The show originates in 2005, when creator Vladimir Ponomarev created a comic of the show for the comics festival. Eventually, in 2008, a small music video was made out of this comic, which was a hit success. Finally, after a pilot in 2010, the show was finally released in 2011. Each episode is 11-minutes long. Characters =Main= Juga Juga is a Juma-Qumi member voiced by Vladimir Ponomaryov. He is lazy and somewhat rude, which causes him to lose focus on his magic very easily. Like Shumadan, he has a crush on Yusi, and competes with him to try and win her heart. He often uses dirty tricks to succeed through life, but he is good at heart, and will still help his friends when they truly need it. Like the other members of his tribe, Juga is blue and rectangular with three ear-like extensions in various shades of blue coming out of the back of his head. He often wears a red, black, green, and orange skullcap. He has black legs, and blue arms with black fingers. A small thing is located in between his legs or possibly on his back - it might be a small tail of sorts. Yusi Yusi is one of the main characters on Qumi-Qumi. She is a Yumi-Qumi who is voiced by Maryana Spivak in the 1st, 2nd and 14th episode and Alina Rin in the rest of the series. Yusi is a representative of the Yumi-Qumi tribe. She is a hippie-girl coming from a wealthy family who is bored with chasing success. However, Yusi is used to comfort and sometimes acts as a spoiled and fickle girl. Yusi loves high-tech gadgets and is always carrying her portable device which can transform into anything from a phone to a scooter. Yusi can fix any complicated gadget in no time. She is very cheerful and never feels depressed. Yusi is sensitive and sentimental. She loves animals; however, there's almost none left on her island. Being sober- minded, Yusi counterbalances energetic Juga and phlegmatic Shumadan. She cannot understand which of the guys she loves more and behaves as a coquette nourishing their rivalry. Shumadan Shumadan is a Schumi-Qumi member voiced by Vladimir Ponomarev. Like the rest of the Schumi-Qumi, Shumadan is rectangular and green. He has three striped ear-like extensions coming out of his head in green, orange, and black. He has black eyes with three eyelashes on each eye. His mouth is burnt orange, and he has green arms striped orange and lime. His legs are striped in two shades of green. He wears a bag with two red and blue military badges on the straps. =Recurring= Bai-Baba Bai-Baba is a recurring character. She is a Juma-Qumi, and is voiced by Maryana Spivak. Bai-Baba is the second-most important member of the Juma-Qumi tribe, after the Chief. She is the tribe's witch doctor and medicine woman. It is also her job to teach the young Juma-Qumi magic skills. She is easily frustrated by Juga, as he is one of her constantly-failing students. She is one of the saner members of the tribe, but resorts to crazy measures in desperate times. She also owns a ceremonial mask that looks like a gas mask that she often wears in certain situations. Schumi-Qumi General The leader of the Schumi-Qumi tribe and a recurring character in the show.
