A new railway undertaking called SBB Cargo International was founded in partnership with intermodal transport operator Hupac. The new company focuses on block and intermodal trains on the European North-South corridor between Germany and Italy. The shareholders in the new company are SBB Cargo (75%) and Hupac (25%), with further partners possible in the future. The aim is to achieve cost leadership in the intermodal segment by optimising resources on selected routes and halving structural costs. The new company’s customers will primarily comprise intermodal operators, who will account for about 80% of the planned total sales of CHF 300 million.

The primary goal of the NS CTA is to deeply understand the underlying commonalities among these intertwined networks, and, by understanding, improve our ability to analyze, predict, design, and influence complex systems interweaving many kinds of networks.URL: Network Science CTA Home page This emerging research domain, termed network science, also has the potential to accelerate understanding of each genre of network by cross- fertilization of insights, theories, algorithms, and approaches and by expanding their study into the larger context of the multi-genre (or composite) network environments within which each must act. The NS CTA is an alliance between ARL, other government researchers, and a consortium of four research centers: an Academic Research Center (ARC) focused on social/cognitive networks (the SCNARC), an ARC focused on information networks (the INARC), an ARC focused on communications networks (the CNARC), and an Interdisciplinary Research Center (the IRC) focused on interdisciplinary research and technology transition. Overall, these centers include roughly one hundred PhD-level researchers from about 30 universities and industrial research labs, engaged with as many graduate students and interns. The Alliance unites research across organizations and research disciplines to address the critical technical challenges faced by the Army in a world where all missions are embedded in and depend upon many genres of networks. The expected impact of its transdisciplinary research includes greatly enhanced human performance for network-embedded missions and greatly enhanced speed and precision for complex military operations. Beyond this vital focus, its research is also expected to accelerate the reach and depth of our understanding of the interwoven networks that so profoundly influence all our lives. The Alliance conducts interdisciplinary research in network science and transitions the results of this fundamental research to address the technical challenges of network-embedded Army operations. The NS CTA research program exploits intellectual synergies across its disciplines by uniting fundamental and applied network science research in parallel. It drives the synergistic combination of these technical areas for network-centric and network-enabling capabilities in support of all missions required of today's military forces, including humanitarian support, peacekeeping, and combat operations in any kind of terrain, but especially in complex and urban settings. It also supports and stimulates dual-use applications of this research and resulting technology to benefit commercial use. As a critical element of this program, the Alliance has created a network science research facility in Cambridge, MA, as well as shared distributed experimental resources throughout the Alliance. The NS CTA also serves the Army's technical needs through an education component, which acts to increase the pool of network science expertise in the Army and the nation while bringing greater awareness of Army technical challenges into the academic and industrial network science research community. In association with the NS CTA research program, there is a separate technology transition component that provides a contractual vehicle for other organizations to fund work focused on transitioning scientific and technical advances into more specific applications. Research projects in the NS CTA are by design, highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary, whether based in one of the three academic research centers, the interdisciplinary research center, or one of the two cross-cutting research initiatives (CCRI).  Core Research Program  = Communication Networks Academic Research Center (CNARC) = The CNARC's research is focused on characterizing complex communications networks, such as those used for network-centric warfare and operations, so that their behavior can be predicted accurately and networks can be configured for optimal information sharing and gathering. In particular, the CNARC will focus on characterizing and controlling the operational information content capacity (OICC) of a tactical network. OICC is a function of the quality and amount of information that is delivered to decision makers. This includes data delivery and security properties of the network. Thus, it is vastly different than other measures of network capacity that are traditionally modeled. In essence, the CNARC models treat the network as an information source. = Information Networks Academic Research Center (INARC) = INARC is aimed at developing the information network technologies required to improve the capabilities of the U.S. Army and providing users with reliable and actionable intelligence across the full spectrum of Network- Centric Operations. INARC will systematically develop the foundation, methodologies, algorithms, and implementations needed for effective, scalable, hierarchical, and most importantly, dynamic and resilient information networks for military applications. The center focuses on Distributed and Real Time Data Integration and Information Fusion; Scalable, Human-Centric Information Network System; and Knowledge Discovery in Information Networks. = Social/Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center (SCNARC) URL: Social/Cognitive Networks Academic Research Center Home page = The modern military increasingly needs to rely on bottom up network processes, as compared to top down hierarchic processes. How does the pattern of interactions within a military unit affect performance of tasks? What kinds of ties external to the Army are necessary to success? How can we use massive streams of data to detect adversarial networks? How can a social and cognitive network quickly extract the most meaningful information for the soldier and decision maker that is useful in all aspects of their operations from supporting humanitarian operations to force protection and full combat operations? These are but a sample of network-related questions with which the 21st century Army must wrestle. The long-term objective of the center is to advance the scientific understanding of how the social networks form, operate and evolve and how they affect the functioning of large, complex organizations such as the Army; how adversary networks hidden in large social networks can be detected, monitored or dissolved; and how human cognition directs and is impacted by the network-centric interactions. SCNARC will undertake research to gain a fundamental understanding of the underlying theory, as well as create scientific foundations for modeling, simulation, measurements, analysis, prediction, and influence of social/cognitive networks and their impact on the U.S. Army. = Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC) = The IRC is focused on performing interdisciplinary research (both basic and applied) that spans the interests in the Alliance and leads to cross-cutting insights into network science and innovative technologies. The IRC transitions basic research from across the Consortium (its own and the ARCs’) into applied research, and, through the Technology Transition component, promotes the rapid transition of technology to meet the specific needs of a network-centric Army. The IRC leads the Education component as a cooperative program across all four centers. The IRC also operates the NS CTA facility, which supports and coordinates distributed collaborative research and experimentation. Programmatically, the IRC is the leader of the Consortium, both intellectually (responsible for setting research directions for the four centers to ensure that research is focused on fundamental network science issues that are relevant to network-centric operations and the Army mission) and administratively (responsible for financial management and for tracking and reporting on the Consortium's work). = Cross-Cutting Research Issues (CCRI) = In addition to the core research, the NS CTA is investigating two research issues that fundamentally cut across the social/cognitive, information, and communications network genres.  Trust in Distributed Decision Making  The goal of the Trust CCRI is to enhance distributed decision making capabilities of the Army in the context of network-centric operations, in particular, for irregular warfare and counterinsurgency by understanding the role trust plays in composite networks that consist of large systems with complex interactions between communication, information, and social/cognitive networks. Adding to the complexity, trust itself can be highly dynamic with uni- and bi-directional relationships forming, adapting, and dissolving at multiple timescales. Our work directly addresses these dynamics from the propagation and staging of data in the network to support establishment of trust and the revocation of network privileges or use in situations of distrust. Trust is contextual, and the degree of trust placed in a relationship can directly relate to factors that exist in each network type. Counterinsurgency and irregular warfare place significant demands on trusted tactical decision-making, as any number of social and cultural factors can influence relationships with the local population and governmental officials. Our work in developing models of trust in composite networks will identify these factors and develop trust metrics than expose utility versus risk in specific courses of action. Trust is also a significant factor in how soldiers perceive and act upon information provided through tactical information systems. Our work in developing cognitive models of trust at the human-machine interface (HMI), models of corroboration for disambiguating data, and the use of argumentation as a mechanism to support automated trust reasoning will directly impact how we build trustworthy systems to convey information to the warfighter.  Evolving Dynamic Integrated Networks (EDIN)  The goal of the EDIN CCRI is to develop appropriate mathematical representations and models of dynamic, composite networks composed of social, information, and communication networks; and to establish theories for analyzing their behavior and predicting the evolution of specific properties of such networks over time. The objective of a tactical network may be viewed as delivering the right information at the right time to the right user (persons, applications, and systems) to enable timely and accurate decision-making and therefore, mission success. The tactical network is composed of multiple interacting networks: communications networks, information networks, command-and-control and other social networks. Understanding the structure of the component networks and the dynamics therein, and of the dynamic interactions between these networks is crucial to the design of robust interdisciplinary (or composite1) networks which is one of the primary goals of the NS CTA program. The overall approach in EDIN is to mathematically characterize the rich interactions between composite networks (which may comprise multiple networks with varying levels of coupling between them), and the dynamics that occur within each network or across networks. Examples of key technical approaches within EDIN include the development of formal models for reasoning about interacting networks; development of a theory of composite graphs for modeling interacting networks; modeling and analysis of group behaviors using techniques ranging beyond traditional graph theory; development of community discovery algorithms; characterization of temporal graph properties; development of mathematically tractable tactical mobility models; development of theories of co-evolution of interacting networks, etc. Modeling the evolution and dynamics of a network entails understanding both the structural properties of dynamic networks and understanding the dynamics of processes (or behaviors) of interest embedded in the network. Typically, the dynamics of network structure impacts certain processes (e.g., how information propagates through the network); but at the same time the dynamics of processes (or behaviors) may result in alteration of network structures. Therefore, gaining a fundamental understanding of such relationships under several kinds of network dynamics is of paramount importance for obtaining significant insights into the behavior and evolution of complex military networks as well as adversarial networks. EDIN will also investigate a particular type of network dynamics, i.e., mobility (not only of communication devices but also of human beings, information etc.), which is particularly important in the military network context. = Participating Institutions in the Alliance = *Army Research Laboratory *CERDEC *BBN Technologies (Principal member, IRC, and Consortium Lead).

It is native to the western Pacific Ocean where it occurs on reefs and in lagoons. Description The scribbled rabbitfish grows to a length of about . The dorsal fin has thirteen spines and ten soft rays while the anal fin has seven spines and nine soft rays. The spines are robust and venomous. This fish is yellow with a network of fine blue lines on the body, giving it a pattern that resembles a printed circuit board and leads to one of its common names, scribbled rabbitfish. There are two oblique, dark stripes, one running from just below the mouth, through the eye to the nape, and one passing through the operculum. Distribution and habitat The scribbled rabbitfish is a marine fish which occurs in the tropical regions, especially found in western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from eastern Indonesia northwards to Palau and Kosrae, and southward to northern Australia and Tonga. It occurs on the seaward side of reefs and on reef edges, and also in deep lagoons and coral-rich areas in lagoons. Its depth ranges from 2 to 15 meters.http://www.fishbase.org/summary/4623 Biology The scribbled rabbitfish is herbivorous and feed on algae. Juvenile fish form schools, but when the fish reach a length of about they begin to divide up into pairs, which may remain in the schools alongside smaller fish. Larger fish do not school and are usually found in pairs, each with a home range that overlaps that of other pairs. The bonding is not necessarily for the purposes of reproduction, as about 25% of the pairs are formed by two individuals of the same sex. The primary purpose of the pair bonding is likely to be of a reproductive nature but it may be partially used as a defence against predators, and it is also useful for a novel feeding strategy. When a group of animals is feeding together, if one reacts to a threat, all can benefit by acting appropriately. A pair of scribbled rabbitfish spends about 80% of their time together and are seldom out of visual range. One fish often probes deep into a crevice for food while the other remains alert nearby. Without the presence of the second fish, the grazer would be at greater risk of attack by an unseen predator, and would likely not benefit from the feeding opportunities that left it unsighted in this way. The pair bond enables them to harvest food to which they would otherwise not have access.

( ) is a Greek black comedy series created by Alexandros Rigas and Dimitris Apostolou which aired on Mega Channel in 2000 and lasted only 6 episodes. The series focuses on the lives of four women who want to take revenge from the man who sexually abused them when they were little girls. Despite the fact that Ti Psyhi Tha Paradoseis Mori? drew extremely high ratings from its beginning, the shootings were abruptly interrupted during the production of the 7th episode, which was never completed, leading to the series cancellation. Series Overview The plot concentrates on four women that grew up together in an orphanage, trying to revenge a worker of the institution, who, when they were little girls, raped them regularly. These four, now in their 40s, after hearing the news of his upcoming return to Greece, who is now a renowned defendant of children's rights, regroup again, after all those years to seek revenge against him, by murdering him. The women include Aleka, a single mother of a teenage son -who is a computer addict- with firm left wing beliefs, working as a journalist in a gossip magazine; Dominique Cesar, a French single woman working as a director in a major shipping company, having an affair with her boss; Popi, a depressed married woman, constantly bullied by her husband and his sister, working at her husband's restaurant; and, finally, Fotini (Fofo), a woman devoting her life at the services of the church, a very religious person, who is single. The Four Women * Aleka Kaloudaki portrayed by Chrysa Ropa. Aleka's mother gave birth to her while she was imprisoned in the jail of Nea Alikarnassos, accused for her husband's murder, something that was never proven. Aleka, a fanatic communist is now a chief editor in a gossip magazine and has a son. Her husband abandoned them. * Dominique Cesar portrayed by Eleni Rantou. Dominique or Dodo is from France and grew up in the orphanage because her parents died on a cruise across Aegean Sea, due to a storm. Dodo now works in a sailing company and has an illegal affair with her boss, who is married. * Popi Kamenou portrayed by Ava Galanopoulou. Popi's parents dumped her while she was still a baby outside the Mansion of Radio and Television. She is unhappily married and works at her husband's taverna. Her husband treats her badly along with her sister-in-law. * Fotini Tsintikidou portrayed by Eleni Kastani. Fotini or Fofo grew up in the orphanage because her mother died after she gave birth to her and her father got imprisoned. Fotini works at the toll station and lives with her father, a small-time crook who doesn't really care about her. Fofo is deeply religious and secretly in love with Father Lambros, the Priest of the church.

The rumors became true when Mega Channel started airing each episode every 2 weeks, in order to fill the gap in its schedule. Ultimately, the station cancelled the series after the 6th episode was aired and during the shootings of the 7th. The Last Unfinished Episode In the last episode, the four women, after a few failures and difficulties they faced in killing Mandas, decide to go to his house as reporters to interview him. Mandas actually knew who the women really are and threatens to kill them. The show ends there without knowing what happened afterwards. Series Continuity Various sources claim that the women actually manage to kill Mandas and the series then follows the girls in a period of terror full of guilt and regret. When they are reassured that the police can not discover them, they calm down and start to feel, for their first time in their life, strong. Before the story ends, the four women face a dilemma. Mandas according to what is right, was punished for his crimes. They are absolutely sure they did the right thing, but they feel that they should also be punished for the crime they did. Therefore, they surrender themselves to the police, admitting that they murdered Mandas. In the beginning, the police find it hard to believe them, but soon the truth is revealed. The story gets front page in the media and the public opinion is divided. In the court room, they find fanatic supporters and the society that once showed them its cruel face, vindicates them and now are free to start their lives from the beginning. Reruns Despite its cancellation and the fact that the series only consists of 7 episodes, Ti Psyhi Tha Paradoseis Mori? remains very popular to this day. The station reran the show in 2001, in 2004, in 2007, in 2010 and in 2011 achieving high ratings each time. Possible Remake Since the series cancellation in 2000, unconfirmed rumors started spreading, stating the completion of the series or even a remake. The first rumor spread a few months after the show was cancelled, saying that some of the stars will be replaced so that the series gets completed. In 2009 it was rumoured that Mega Channel, asked from the creators to continue the series. Alexandros Rigas and Dimitris Apostolou were open to the idea. However, Ti Psyhi Tha Paradoseis Mori? was cancelled once again, since most of the actors were committed to other projects. In 2010, Mega Channel, due to its 20 years of operation, decided to air the series once again. Initially, it was thought the series continuation but it was never confirmed nor by the station or the creators. Later, the station actually announced that it was time to learn how the series continued and ended. The idea was to make a special montage of the unfinished episode with the series creator, Alexandros Rigas, narrating the end of the story. However, it was never materialized and Mega Channel only rerun the 7 episodes.

Biography The Angeloi of Thessaly rose to prominence during the reign of the Simeon Uroš ruler of Epirus and Thessaly (r. 1359–1370), as they were related to his wife. When Simeon died in 1370, he was succeeded by his son John Uroš (r. 1370–1373). John cared more for religious pursuits than the governance of the state, and entrusted the affairs of state to Alexios, who held the high Byzantine title of Caesar. Eventually, probably in 1372/73, John retired from public life altogether and entered a monastery, leaving Alexios as the ruler of Thessaly... Alexios was married to Maria Angelina Radoslava (born late 1356 or after, if she is the daughter of Irene Asanina), a daughter of the Serbian general Radoslav Hlapen, and was supported by the powerful local magnates. Around 1382, Alexios sought the protection of the Byzantine Empire, recognizing the suzerainty of the prince Manuel Palaiologos, who at the time governed Thessalonica as an appanage. Alexios is lastly recorded in 1388, and must have died by c. 1390, when he was succeeded by his son (or perhaps brother), Manuel.; . It is recorded that in 1389, the \\"Caesar of Thessaly\\" sent aid to the ruler of Ioannina, Esau de' Buondelmonti against the Albanian tribes of Epirus, and that their joint forces scored a major victory over them, but it is unclear if by that date Alexios was still alive.. Either he or, more plausibly, Manuel, was the grandfather of the mid-15th century Serbian ruler Mihailo Anđelović and the Ottoman Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angelović..

Life Born at Maidstone in Kent on 15 May 1794, he was son of Abraham Harris, Unitarian minister at Swansea for 40 years. George was at the age of fourteen placed in a Manchester warehouse in Cheapside, London, but, wishing to enter the Unitarian ministry, he gave up his place. In his eighteenth year he entered the Islington Academy, then under John Evans. In November 1812 he matriculated at Glasgow University, on a bursary from Dr Daniel Williams's trust, and attended classes in Glasgow during three winter sessions. His studies were interrupted by engagements as a preacher and lecturer. The Scottish Unitarian Association was formed in July 1813. Harris was one of its originators, and was for three years its secretary. He also spent time in establishing Unitarian churches, principally in Paisley, Greenock, and neighbouring towns, and in directing Unitarian stations in different parts of Scotland. In 1816 he issued A Statement of the Principles of Unitarian Christianity addressed to the Inhabitants of Greenock and Port Glasgow, and to the Friends of Free Inquiry throughout Scotland, by a Unitarian, a concise manual of Unitarian teaching. By his efforts a Unitarian chapel was erected in Port Glasgow. It was opened by him in January 1822; the sermon which he preached on the occasion was published. At this period he also published Select Pieces for Reading and Recitation. In April 1817, Harris was invited to become minister of Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool, then vacant by the resignation of Robert Lewin. He was inducted in July, and his convictions soon engaged him in numerous controversies. Many censured his severe attacks on evangelical doctrine. His pamphlet, Unitarianism, the only Religion which can become Universal, and a course of Sunday evening lectures, published as Unitarianism and Trinitarianism contrasted, called forth replies. Dr. James Barr of Oldham Street Presbyterian Church, Dr. John Stewart of Mount Pleasant Secession Church, and Mr. Jones of St. Andrew's Church were his most prominent opponents. In 1818 Harris planned a Unitarian Christian Association for the dissemination of unitarian literature, and he travelled through Lancashire and Cheshire to gain for it sympathy and support. In the summer of 1821 a division occurred in the Bank Street Unitarian congregation, Bolton, and in 1822 Harris accepted an invitation to become minister of the seceders. They first met at the Cloth Hall, but in 1823 the Moor Lane Church was purchased from the Scottish presbyterians. Harris was known in Manchester as ‘the intrepid champion of Socinianism.’ In 1822 he published The Lancashire and Cheshire Unitarian Association, and the Christian Reflector vindicated; in 1823 he published an account of the formation of the Moor Lane congregation, some statements in which provoked replies from other clergymen; and in 1824 appeared Christianity defended. In 1824 a speech by him in Manchester led to a long correspondence, which was afterwards published under the title of The Manchester Socinian Controversy, and indirectly caused the Hewley lawsuit. In September 1825 Harris resigned his charge in Bolton, and moved to Glasgow, his wife's native place. He preferred the call to Glasgow to one from London, ‘because,’ he said, 'he wished to stand in the front of the battle.' The evangelical revival led by Thomas Chalmers was then at its height, but Harris attracted large audiences. In 1841 Harris moved to Edinburgh to assist in reviving the Unitarian congregation. He stayed four years, though with less success than in Glasgow, and in 1845 he accepted an invitation to become the minister of Hanover Square Chapel, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. A new church was erected in 1854, and a large congregation gathered. He died on 24 December 1859. Works and views Harris was constantly writing, lecturing, or preaching, and advocating Sunday schools, benevolence funds, tract and book societies, and institutions for mutual improvement. He threw himself into political and sanitary, educational, and moral movements. He was a keen radical, active for the repeal of the corn laws, on behalf of which he drew up the first petition sent from Scotland. After the Rathcormac ‘massacre’ in Ireland in the seizure of tithes (18 December 1834), he denounced church establishments. In Scotland he was called ‘the devil's chaplain,’ to which it was replied: ‘The Prince of Darkness must be a gentleman if his chaplains are like George Harris.’ His other publications included: *The Great Business of Life, 1847. *Christian Unitarianism New Testament Christianity, 1848. *The Doctrine of the Trinity, 1853. *The Christian Character, as illustrated in the Life and Labours of the late Rev. William Turner, 1859. For twenty-one years Harris was editor of the Christian Pilot and Pioneer.

He was born at Colombo, Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) and died at Galmington, Taunton, Somerset. Waldock was educated at Uppingham School and from 1918 was at Hertford College, Oxford. As a cricketer, he was a left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first- innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that \\"Waldock did so well... that people began to talk about him as the coming left-hand bat\\". In the 1919–20 rugby union season, Waldock was awarded his Oxford blue as well; he played at fly-half. The 1920 cricket season saw Waldock as an established member of the Oxford University cricket team and as secretary the expectation was that he would go on to captain the team in 1921. That did not happen because Waldock left the university at the end of the summer 1920 term. The 1920 Oxford team was very strong in both batting and fielding. Waldock was singled out in the season report in Wisden for his fielding at mid-off, though it added that his batting was a \\"disappointment\\". His highest score for the university side was only 46 and with Reg Bettington and Greville Stevens in the team, his bowling was scarcely used at all. After Oxford University had played Somerset in early June, however, Waldock played for Somerset in the county team's next match against Warwickshire at Bath. And when the university season was over in early July, he joined Somerset to the end of the season, and scored consistent runs for the team, with a highest of 78 in the match against Worcestershire at Worcester, where Wisden reported that he \\"found the batting form which had quite deserted him while he was playing for Oxford\\". In the 1920 season as a whole, Waldock made 849 runs at an average of 21.76; he did not bowl for Somerset. After the 1920 season, Waldock did not return to Oxford and disappeared from first-class cricket for three years. He reappeared in four matches for Somerset at the start of the 1924 season, but those were his last games in English first-class cricket. For the next dozen years, he played for Sri Lankan side, appearing in a few first-class matches against touring teams from England and India. In his last recorded match, a one-day match against the MCC team that was heading for an Ashes series in Australia in 1936/37, he was captain of the Ceylon team. Waldock's brother, Harold, was at Uppingham and Hertford College, Oxford with him and also won a rugby union blue. A younger brother, Humphrey, became a distinguished judge and was knighted.

She was appointed, in 2010, to the Commission for the National Police of East Timor Promotion by the East Timor State Secretary for the Council of Ministers, Isabel da Costa Ferreira.  Biography  Guilhermina Marçal is a Roman Catholic Canossian sister. She was born in Same (East Timor) and has been working for the promotion of independence, as well as social, economic and cultural rights in that country. When the first President of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, was in prison during the struggle for independence, he was visited by Marçal. Marçal would smuggle messages in and also smuggle replies out to Falintil supporters. The Catholic Church in East Timor has been at the heart of the humanitarian operations in the wake of the country's political crises and ethnic violence. Sister Guilhermina's story of bravery and outstanding service to the people is one of many. When people fled violence, looting and arson attacks between April and June 2006, they sought shelter in a convent run by the Canossian Sisters. More than 8,000 people were formally registered at the site, but convent head Sister Guilhermina Marcal said the number swelled to up to 13,000 at night. She administered the supply of food provided by the World Food Programme. Sister Guilhermina visited New Zealand to brief NZ Parliamentarians in 2007 telling them that Security was still the most pressing problem for Timor-Leste. She and other convent nuns ran the camp by themselves for the first four months. Sister Guilhermina said the convent camp had problems with malaria, dengue fever, and diarrhea.

Originating in Angus, he came from a family of English origin who by the end of the 14th century had become well established in Scottish society. A student of the University of Paris and University of Orleans, he began his career at home by the later 1370s. He became a royal clerk, and appears to have held the position of archdeacon of Lothian c. 1386. After extending his education at Paris in the 1390s, he returned to Scotland to continue clerical and ambassadorial duties for the monarch, and was awarded with the bishopric of Brechin in 1407. He held this post, along with that of Clerk of the Register, until his death in either 1425 or 1426. Origins and early education It is known from later documents that Walter Forrester was from the diocese of Brechin, born sometime in or before 1355.Watt, Dictionary, p. 197 The Forresters were a middle-ranking family of English origin who rose to greater prominence during Walter's lifetime.Ewan, \\"Forrester family\\" The name of his father is unrecorded, but his mother's name was Mariota or Marion.Ewan, \\"Forrester family\\"; Watt, Dictionary, p. 197 He had a brother named Patrick Forrester, a burgess of Dundee, and a half-brother named Patrick de Dalgarnock. John Forrester, variously Archdeacon of Teviotdale, Official of Aberdeen and Official of Glasgow, and Adam Forrester, burgess of Edinburgh, laird of Corstorphine and one of the wealthiest merchants in contemporary Scotland, were his kinsmen, though the detail of this kinship is not recorded.Ewan, \\"Forrester family\\"; Watt, Dictionary, pp. 195, 197; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 31, 223, 228, 245 Forrester attended the University of Paris, graduating Bachelor of Arts under fellow- Scot William de Trebrun in March 1375, and becoming Licentiate in Arts the following May. He was a student of canon law at the University of Orleans c. 1375-79. He returned to Scotland by April 1379. By 12 April 1384 he was holding a canonry attached to Aberdeen Cathedral.Watt, Dictionary, p. 198 It is likely that the prebend was the church of Mortlach, as he can be confirmed holding this church in a document datable to 22 April 1392. Clerical service and later education Forrester began a career in the service of the Scottish monarchy, becoming Deputy Clerk of the Wardrobe in the late 1370s and Clerk of the Wardrobe by March 1381.Ewan, \\"Forrester family\\"; Watt, Dictionary, p. 198 He was Keeper of the Privy Seal for a short period in 1386 (filling in for Duncan Petit), and served an auditor of the exchequer from March 1386. He is found as the officiating clerk in a treaty between Scotland and France sealed at Edinburgh on 1 December 1390. On or before 11 March 1391, he resigned to other members of his family his own land at Inverdovat in Forgan parish, Fife, reserving for himself a life-interest; this perhaps indicates that he had set himself on an ecclesiastical career.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 198—9 He appears as Archdeacon of Lothian in documents from 1386, an extremely prestigious position (or claim at least) he appears to have lost by 1390, when the position is securely held by another.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 401-02; Watt, Dictionary, p. 198 Other honours held before the episcopate, excluding Mortlach, include the church of Liston (by November 1391), previously held by Gilbert de Greenlaw, and the office of sub-dean of Brechin. From early 1393 until early 1399, he appears to have resumed his studies on the continent, financed perhaps by the Scottish king.Watt, Dictionary, p. 199 By February 1394 he had an M.A. from Paris, and served as regent in the Arts for several years while once again studying canon law. He was a Bachelor of Decrees by July 1398. He was three times serving proctor of the English nation at Paris, March and April 1395, winter 1396/7, and Summer 1398. He was university rector between October and December 1395. Along with two Germans and one John de Edinburgh, he represented the \\"English nation\\" at the Second Council of Paris (August and September 1396), and was the nation's proctor at the Third Council (May to July 1398), meetings aimed at ending the Schism. This Council withdrew support from Pope Benedict XIII (\\"Antipope\\"), and there is much evidence that Forrester was an enthusiastic proponent of this position, though he later was to serve as a bishop in obedience to this pope.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 197-98 Returning to Scotland in 1398, he regained his position as Clerk of the Wardrobe. At a royal council in Perth in January 1398, he was named as one of 20 assistants of the Duke of Rothesay as lieutenant of the realm. He was exchequer auditor every year between 1399 and 1404, and was secretary of the king from either the second half of 1401 or first half of 1402, and held this position until Robert III's death in 1406. By June 1403 he was Clerk of the Rolls, a position he would hold until his death. In the first five years of the 1400s (decade), he frequently served as an ambassador to the English, and went to France in 1406, appearing at Paris in April on a committee of the English nation, a trip perhaps connected with his candidacy for the bishopric of Brechin. Episcopate Walter was elected bishop of Brechin at some point between 1405 and April 1407.Watt, Dictionary, p. 198; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 55 On 11 April 1407 Benedict XIII instructed Henry de Wardlaw, bishop of St Andrews, and Fionnlagh MacCailein, bishop of Dunblane, to investigate any objections to Walter's election, perhaps on account of former hostility to Benedict's cause. He does not appear to have received consecration until some point between 11 May 1410 and 10 May 1411.Dowden, Bishops, p. 184; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p.198 ; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 55 After becoming bishop, Walter remained a prominent royal servant, continuing his duties as Clerk of the Rolls and Clerk of the Register, and enjoyed a strong relationship with the ruler of Scotland, now Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. He officiated at every exchequer audit between May 1409 and July 1422. He also continued his ambassadorial role, serving as leader of a mission to England in 1408 to negotiate the release of James I, the nominal king. He appears to have gone on further missions in May 1412, April 1413 and September 1413, though the evidence we have is for the grants of safe-conduct rather than the expeditions themselves. He was in Rome 1423-1424, and made a separate trip to Flanders later in 1424.Dowden, Bishops, p. 184; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, pp. 200-01 After James I's return in 1424, he served once more as exchequer auditor, 7 May 1425.Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 200 Like other bishops of Brechin, Forrester does not seem to have been very active in his diocese, on several occasions obtaining papal indults legitimizing procurations without visitation. He is recorded presiding over statutes issued by his cathedral chapter in 1410, and later in the year pursued land claims successfully with the support of Governor Albany and his sheriff in Angus. Albany granted him the second tenth of crown revenues from the sheriffdom of Kincardine in 1413 and 1417. He was present at a provincial council of the Scottish church at Perth on 16 July 1419. Historian D. E. R. Watt has summarised that \\"though he did visit Brechin from time to time and [did] take some interest in [the] organisation and property of his see, it does not add up to much\\". His appearance at the exchequer audit of May 1425 was his last in the records.Dowden, Bishops, pp. 184-85; Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 200; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 55 By 7 June 1426, when his successor John de Crannach was provided to the see at the papal court, he must have been dead for some time. He was probably dead by the exchequer audit of 15 April, when John de Scheves was acting as Clerk of the Rolls and Register (an indication that Bishop Forrester was no longer available to perform this office).Watt, Biographical Dictionary, p. 200; Watt and Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 55 Notes References   1350s births 1420s deaths 15th-century Roman Catholic bishops Bishops of Brechin People from Angus Rectors of the University of Paris University of Paris alumni ","title":"Walter Forrester"},{"id":"28961825","text":"A war song is a musical composition that relates to war.

A member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame, Peltz is best known for his fight promotions at the Arena, Spectrum, The Blue Horizon, several Atlantic City casinos and currently at the 2300 Arena in South Philadelphia and the PARX Casino in Bensalem, PA.  Early life  Peltz was born in the Wynnefield section of Philadelphia, but his family moved to Bala Cynwyd, PA, after he finished second grade. He became a boxing fan at age 12 and saw his first live fight at 13. A 1964 graduate of Lower Merion High School, Peltz was a Journalism major at Temple University and he was named the Outstanding Male Journalism Graduate there in 1968. After his junior year at Temple, Peltz landed a job on the copy desk at the Evening & Sunday Bulletin in Philadelphia, working the midnight shift from the summer of 1967 thru the summer of 1969. When he couldn't get the job as the boxing writer, he left The Bulletin to become a boxing promoter. His first boxing card in Philadelphia was on September 30, 1969, with a main event at the Blue Horizon featuring Bennie Briscoe vs. Tito Marshall. Briscoe won by knockout and the Blue Horizon had a standing-room-only crowd of 1,606.  Career  After promoting at various venues in Philadelphia for four years, including the well-known 7,000-seat Arena in West Philadelphia, Peltz was named Director of Boxing at the Spectrum in South Philadelphia. Peltz became one of the most successful local boxing promoters in the world during his tenure at the Spectrum, from 1973 until 1980. Some top Philly area fighters Peltz showcased: Bennie Briscoe (who Peltz handled for 10 years), Willie Monroe, Bobby Watts, Eugene Cyclone Hart, Stanley \\"Kitten\\" Hayward, Mike Rossman, Sammy Goss, Richie Kates, Tyrone Everett, George Benton, Curtis Parker, Jeff Chandler and Matthew Saad Muhammad. Middleweight champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler boxed five times for Peltz at the Spectrum. Other out-of-town fighters who boxed for Peltz at the Spectrum included: Marvin Johnson, Ernie Terrell, Earnie Shavers, Michael Spinks, Emile Griffith, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Durán, Alfredo Escalera, Jesse Burnett, Yaqui Lopez, Billy Douglas, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad and Bobby Chacon. When Tyrone Everett challenged Alfredo Escalera at the Spectrum for the WBC junior lightweight title in 1976, the 16,019 attendance set the record for the largest crowd ever to watch a fight indoors in Pennsylvania. In 1978, when Bennie Briscoe met Marvelous Marvin Hagler at the Spectrum in a 10-round match, the 14,950 fans in attendance established the mark for the largest indoor crowd in Pennsylvania history for a non- championship fight. Peltz guided a fighter to the world title for the first time in 1978 when Marvin Johnson won the WBC light-heavyweight title, stopping Mate Parlov in Marsala, Sicily. Johnson also twice won the WBA version of the title in 1979 and 1986, respectively. Peltz handled Jeff Chandler, the Hall- of-Fame bantamweight champion, who gained the WBA crown in 1980 when he knocked out Julian Solís in Miami, Florida. Chandler held the title for nearly four years and nine successful defenses. After the rise of casinos in Atlantic City in the 1970s, Peltz began to promote at the now defunct Sands Atlantic City and Resorts Atlantic City, while continuing to promote boxing shows in Philadelphia. He promoted fight cards at most of the Atlantic City casinos: Bally's, Harrahs Marina, Trump Castle, Caesars, The Claridge and the Playboy Hotel & Casino. In those years, world champions Peltz handled included: Charlie \\"Choo Choo\\" Brown (boxer) (IBF lightweight champion); Gary Hinton (IBF junior welterweight champion); Charles Williams (boxer) (IBF light- heavyweight); Robert Hines (IBF junior middleweight champion); and Charles Brewer (IBF super middleweight champion). Another Peltz fighter, middleweight Frank Fletcher, became one of network television's most popular fighters, boxing six times on NBC in wildly exciting brawls from 1981 through 1984. Other Peltz fighters who challenged for world titles during those years included: Jerry Martin (light-heavyweight); Tony Thornton (super middleweight); Bryant Brannon (super middleweight); Billy Irwin (lightweight). Through the 1980s and 1990s, Peltz became synonymous with boxing at the Blue Horizon, including an eight-year stretch (1993–2001) of consecutive sellouts in the 1,346-seat building. Peltz was a partner with New Jersey-based Main Events in promotion of the late boxing champion Arturo Gatti from 1991-2004. Peltz also guided Kassim Ouma of Uganda to the IBF junior middleweight title in 2004. Twelve years later he guided Jason Sosa, of Camden, NJ, to the WBA junior lightweight title. Peltz is active as a boxing promoter at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia and the PARX Casino in Bensalem, PA. . He is president of Peltz Boxing Promotions, Inc., in Philadelphia.  Personal life  Peltz married his college sweetheart, Patricia McKeown, in August, 1969, but they separated in July, 1975, and were divorced in 1977. In February, 1976, he began dating Linda Sablosky, a classmate from Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, PA. They have been married since June, 1977, and have one son, Daniel.

Early life Letts was the only child of Walter John Letts, a railway superintendent, and Charlotte Helen (née Robertson) of Steep Hill House, Lincoln. He was educated at Aldeburgh Lodge, Suffolk, Roydon Hall, Norfolk, and at Lancing College, Sussex, where he excelled in sport, representing the school in swimming, football and cricket, and was a sergeant in the Officers' Training Corps. Military service In mid-1915 he left school to attend the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Lincolnshire Regiment on 26 January 1916. He was immediately seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and posted to No. 1 Reserve Squadron at RAF Gosport to begin his flying training. On 19 March he made his first solo flight, in a Maurice Farman Longhorn, after only four hours of dual instruction. His second solo flight, later the same day, ended when he crashed into the side of a shed. Letts' first attempt to gain his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate was abandoned after his engine failed, but he passed on his second attempt the next day, 24 March, flying a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School in Farnborough. Letts was appointed a flying officer on 4 May 1916. Following advanced flying training at the Central Flying School at Upavon, on 15 June Letts was posted to No. 27 Squadron RFC in France, to fly the Martinsyde G.100 fighter-bomber. He was invalided back to England on 11 August with an injured knee, and on 19 October was posted to No. 47 Reserve Squadron at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, to serve as an instructor. He was reassigned to No. 48 Squadron RFC, flying the new two-seater Bristol F2b fighter, on 12 February 1917, and in March the squadron was sent to France. On 5 April Letts was appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary captain, replacing William Leefe-Robinson, who had been shot down and captured. On the afternoon of 9 April Letts and his observer Lieutenant Harold George Collins, accompanied by an aircraft piloted by Captain Alan Wilkinson with 2nd Lieutenant Laurence W. Allen, engaged five aircraft from Jagdgeschwader 1 — Richthofen's \\"Flying Circus\\" — in a dogfight over Arras. They jointly claimed two aircraft shot down, even though Letts aircraft was \\"cut to ribbons\\", and Collins killed. Letts next victory came on 4 May, when he and observer 2nd Lieutenant L. Speller shared in the destruction of an Albatros D.III over Pelves with pilot 2nd Lieutenant H. Smithers and observer AM2 Valentine Reed. On 11 May, in a fight with aircraft from Jagdstaffel 11, Letts and Jameson, with Smithers and AM2 Rutherford, shared an Albatros D.III shot down over Biache-Dury, but Letts' aircraft was badly damaged, and two other British aircraft were also shot down. Letts managed to nurse his aircraft back over the British front lines before crash landing. The next day he claimed two more enemy aircraft, driving down an Albatros D.III over Beaumont with 2nd Lt. Jameson in the morning, and another D.III driven down over Izel with Lt. Allen in the afternoon, bringing his total to six. On 24 May Letts and Allen were attacked by four enemy aircraft over Vitry, and claimed to have destroyed two while driving the other two off, though Allen was wounded. They were officially credited with one victory. Letts was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 16 August. The citation read: :2nd Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) John Herbert Towne Letts, Lincolnshire Regiment and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He attacked four large two seaters, driving two down out of control and forcing the remaining two down. He has helped to destroy eight machines, and throughout has set a splendid example.\\" Letts, with observer Lieutenant C. A. Malcomson, shared with Smithers and Jameson in the destruction of another Albatros D.III over Douai on 27 May. On 5 June Letts and Jameson drove down another two-seater over Riencourt–Cagnicourt. On 17 August he and Jameson were attacked by eight Albatros D.IIIs east of Nieuport. The combined fire of Jameson and 2nd Lieutenant L. H. Tanner, the observer of 2nd Lieutenant Alan Craddock Simpson, sent one enemy aircraft down in a spin until it broke apart in mid-air. On 26 July Letts was promoted to lieutenant in his regiment. On 22 August, flying with observer Lieutenant Harold R. Power, Letts and two other Bristol Fighters intercepted ten Gotha bombers off Zeebrugge, returning from a raid on the English coast. In the battle that followed Power was hit by enemy fire, and the barrel of his gun swung round and struck Letts on the head. Despite suffering from a concussion he returned to base, discovering on landing that Power was dead. On 4 September Letts and observer 2nd Lieutenant John Frost, destroyed two Albatros D.Vs over Ghistelles, and on 15 September he and Frost pursued and eventually drove down another enemy aircraft north-east of Dixmude. Letts returned to England on 19 September, briefly serving at the Aeroplane Experimental Station at Martlesham Heath, and then as an instructor at the School of Air Fighting from October 1917. He eventually returned to front-line service at his own request, being posted to No. 42 Training Depot Squadron on 1 October 1918, before returning to France on 10 October to serve as a flight commander in No. 64 Squadron RAF. However, on arrival he was as ordered to join No. 87 Squadron RAF to fly the Sopwith Dolphin. The following day Letts borrowed an SE.5a from No. 32 Squadron RAF. Shortly after taking off the aircraft rolled, then plunged to earth killing him instantly.Shores et.al. (1990), p.238. He is buried in grave VI.

The intent of braided stainless steel brake lines is to improve brake system effectiveness and longevity as compared to an equivalent system fitted with flexible rubber hoses through near-elimination of hose expansion. The difference in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines is a result of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system. Technical Rationale The typical operation of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a connecting tube and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement at the opposite end of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic fluid path, providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a suspension component which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal brake line tubing, and the brake at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that braided stainless steel hose is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system. In light of the above, it is reasonable to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel brake lines. It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel brake lines are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel brake lines are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.

Roman Britain Organisationhttp://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/4150/ladle_hill.html The Modern Antiquarian =The unfinished hillfort= Ladle Hill is perhaps the best known of all of the unfinished hillforts in Britain (Feacham 1971). It was first correctly identified as an unfinished hillfort and described in detail by the archaeologist Stuart Piggott in 1931. The site has been invaluable to help archeologists understand the methods employed in the creation of Iron Age date univallate enclosures, with the partially constructed nature of the site revealing features that would normally be concealed in a completed example, such as for possible setting-out ditches, and piles of chalky soil initially quarried from the ditch and deposited in the interior for finishing the rampart.\\"The wessex hillforts project: extensive survey of hillforts in central southern England\\", Andrew Payne, Mark Corney and Barry Cunliffe, published by English Heritage, 15/09/2006, At Ladle Hill it has long been suspected that the area demarcated by the unfinished earthworks never actually contained a settlement, although there is a possibility that the hillfort was to be constructed over an earlier unenclosed settlement. Magnetometer surveys from 1997 shows none of the variation normally associated with former occupation sites on chalk geology, and this would seem to confirm that a settlement with typical Iron Age characteristics, such as storage pits, was never established within the boundary of the earthwork. The earthworks were intended to enclose an area of approximately and was marked by a slight ditch, or possibly an earlier palisaded enclosure. Apart from the dumps of material associated with the abandoned construction works, the interior has very few other earthworks of intelligible character. A dewpond on the hill with the hillfort earthworks in the background =Surrounding area= By contrast the surrounding areas contain a number of features of interest, including a linear ditch that runs along the crest of the west-facing escarpment of Great Litchfield Down and Ladle Hill, and is approximately in length. It ends at a slight spur overlooking the valley floor barrow cemetery of Seven Barrows. For a kilometer or so of its visible southern course, this earthwork also forms the western boundary of a large field system on Great Litchfield Down. This field system does not extend northwards as far as Ladle Hill. Immediately to the east of the unfinished hillfort is another linear ditch, not overlain by the hillfort, which is approximately in length, finishing at the head of a coombe below Hare Warren Down. To the east of this linear ditch is another large field system, visible both as areas of earthworks and as soil and crop marks on aerial photographs. To the southwest of Ladle Hill are two sub-square earthwork enclosures, each of approximately . Both are undated, but a possible link exists between such enclosures, linear ditches, and areas of probable grazing during the time of the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age transition (Cunliffe 1991, pg386). The features surrounding Ladle Hill are beyond the northern limit of the known field system on Great Litchfield Down and west of the fields on Hare Warren Down and Nuthanger Down. The unfinished hillfort therefore appears to be in an atypical Wessex location, being very close to major linear earthwork features, and in an area without an existing field system. Immediately to the north of Ladle Hill lies a well preserved disc barrow, some in diameter. Just beyond this there is evidence for traces of platforms that may represent the remains of an unenclosed settlement (Piggott 1931). This feature has never been surveyed in detail and although an open settlement is possible it may be that these are features of other disturbance such as localized surface quarrying. Within the northern half of the camp there are traces of a small, low mound, approximately in diameter, thought to be a disc barrow, but magnetometer surveys did not show any trace of a surrounding ditch. The mound today is hardly discernible, but early aerial photographs of the site (circa 1929) show that the mound was better preserved at the time of Piggott's original surveys in the first half of the 20th century. =Roman features= Sited on the steep west slope of the hill is a Roman earthwork, formed by the erection of a substantial bank on the down hill side of the slope. It may have been a small circus or pond. Geology The underlying geology at the site is Cretaceous Upper Chalk, supporting shallow well drained calcareous silty soils over chalk on slopes and crests. Typically these landscapes may be described as 'dramatic', due to their local scale, visual aesthetic and undulating nature. Escarpments are often formed where layers of chalk have been compressed to form a fold, or where the chalk has been faulted, resulting in accelerated erosion along the line of the weakness. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths. Such erosion is clearly visible on the slopes of Ladle Hill. Ecology Fairy flax, Liunum catharticum, can be found on Ladle Hill SSSI The flora and fauna on the hill have been recognised to be of particular importance, and is such that the hill was designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1978. Ladle Hill typifies a calcareous grassland chalk downland habitat now scarce in Britain, and is home to some unusual and rare species. The earthwork in particular is very rich in species, with a good range of downland grasses and large populations of rare and local plants such as field fleawort, Senecio integrifolius; chalk milkwort, Polygala calcarea; hairy rock-cress, Arabis hirsuta; fragrant orchid, Gymnadenia conopsea; and pyramidal orchid, Anacamptis pyramidalis. The earthwork escarpment slopes, though species-rich, support fewer species than within the fort, but some, notably clustered bellflower, Campanula glomerata, only occur there. The site is also importance for its population of the rare July flowering form of the burnt-tip orchid, Orchis ustulata. This form is morphologically distinct, has a peculiar flowering period, and survives now only on a few sites in Britain.http://www.english- nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001172.pdf English Nature SSSI Description The hill also supports salad burnet, thyme, fairy flax and hairy violet. There is some scattered scrub on the north-facing slope but there does not appear to be on-going encroachment. Location The site is located at , on Great Litchfield Down, to the southeast of the village of Old Burghclere, in the county of Hampshire. The hill has a summit of AOD just within the civil parish of Litchfield and Woodcott, with the hill also falling within the two other civil parishes of Burghclere, and Ecchinswell, Sydmonton and Bishops Green. Nearby to the west lies Beacon Hill and to the immediate east is Watership Down. Also to the north east lies Old Burghclere Lime Quarry SSSI. The A34 runs between the Ladle Hill and Beacon Hill to the east. The site and surrounding downs are easily accessible by public footpath, including the nearby cross county footpath, Wayfarer's Walk.

Random House) Riders of Judgment is the fifth book chronologically in Frederick Manfred's The Buckskin Man Tales, which trace themes through five novels set in the 19th Century Great Plains. The story fictionalizes Wyoming's Johnson County War, based on Manfred's original research (which relied heavily on Johnson County Historian Thelma Condit). His analysis of events is close to the story as recounted in Helena Huntington Smith's The War on Powder River, which was published about ten years after Manfred's novel. The novel was the source for the made-for-television film The Johnson County War, starring Tom Berenger, Burt Reynolds, and Luke Perry. Manfred's novelization uses Nate Champion, Jack Flagg, and John Tisdale as the models for his Hammett brothers, Cain, Harry, and Dale, and turns Frank Canton into a strange family nemesis called variously Hunt Lawton and Link Keeler.

The 12-story building was designed by architects Spier & Rohns and was the tallest in the state when built. The lower two floors are faced with a brown rusticated stone with the main entry centered on the south façade and framed by four square pilasters of gray granite. Floors three through five are smooth stone and floors six through twelve are tan brick. The structure originally had an elaborate cornice surrounding the twelfth floor which was removed in the 1950s. The light court which extended from the fifth to twelfth floor above the entry was filled in 1988 and faced with glass and a gabled glass roof to provide additional office space.  History  The building was owned and occupied by the United Way for Southeastern Michigan from 1987 to 2009; the city's redevelopment agency purchased it from United way for $1.75 million. For many years prior to 1987, it was known as the Detroit Savings Bank Building and contained offices for the Detroit Savings Bank, which became Detroit Bank and Trust and later Comerica. At the time of construction it was known as the Chamber of Commerce Building and, at 12 stories, is Detroit's oldest existing skyscraper and among the first constructed in the city with a steel skeleton. The 10-story Hammond Building (1889), now demolished, is considered the city's first skyscraper. The Qube in the Detroit Financial District now stands on former Hammond Building site. In May 2013, the Archdiocese of Detroit announced it would consolidate offices from multiple sites in the city into approximately of the building, currently owned by Capitol Park Partners, LLC. After renovations were completed, the chancery and other components moved into the lower six floors of the structure in early 2015, with residences on the upper floors. Part of the renovations included re-creating a cornice at the top of the façade. Richard Karp, whose company oversaw the renovations, said he also plans to restore the name of the Detroit Savings Bank Building.

Maximals The Maximals in Beast Wars Neo are referred to as \\"Cybertrons\\" in Japan, the same name given to the Autobots in Japan. *Big Convoy Big Convoy, the Convoy warrior known as the one man army, is astoundingly powerful, but prefers being alone, heading onto battlefields by himself. He wields a big cannon, which can blitz enemies with a single shot. On orders from Vector Sigma, Big Convoy has been appointed as an instructor to a group of young warriors. He transforms into a Woolly Mammoth. *Longrack Longrack is the gabby, annoying class committee member of the group. He is quite serious about following rules to the letter, and will butt in and aggressively complain to others about it. His Arm Shot attack extends his right arm, while his Crush Arm grabs and mangles his enemies. Longrack also specializes in tinkering with machines. He transforms into a giraffe. *Cohrada His transformative powers favor dry climates. Cohrada represents one of the more experimental Transformers to be released over the course of the Beast Wars era. His beast mode is rather unconventional - a snake. He is not a typical snake that is completely tubular. Rather, he is a cobra (even though reptiles are traditional considered a Predacon beast form), allowing slightly more bulk to the beast mode, allowing for greater possibilities in transformation schemes. *Stampy Stampy is an extreme coward who frequently frustrates his teammates. For all that, he's quick enough to be cheery, yet his mighty ears hardly miss a distant sound, and his speed and intelligence-gathering abilities are outstanding. Stampy can use a technique, called Mighty Ear, allowing him to contact others, no matter how far away they are. The signal must be clear, enough interference, can make technique useless. His favorite food is space carrots. He transforms into a domestic white rabbit. *Break Break launches anchors from his right arm as his weapons. He transforms into a penguin. Amazingly strong in coldness, Break gives full play to his abilities on frigid worlds. He is bold and quick to lose his temper, but is also fiercely concerned for his comrades. The Break Anchors he launches from his right arm are massively destructive. Break loves bathing in ice water and is quite tidy. Break was voted the 11th strangest Transformers Beast Wars figure by Topless Robots.http://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/07/the_12_strangest_transformers_beast_wars_figures.php The 12 Strangest Transformers Beast Wars Figures By Rob Bricken in Daily Lists, Toys Wednesday, Jul. 8 2009 *Heinrad (sometimes mistranslated as \\"Heinlad\\") Heinlad's tech spec statistics only state that he has a rank of 7 - everything else is unknown. His beast mode is also unique, being based upon the tanuki (Japanese raccoon dog). The most notable feature of said animal was amazingly large testes which, according to Japanese legend, the tanuki used as both seat and as drums. This trait is reflected on the toy as two round objects right underneath his clock belly that become hip pads in robot mode, one of which contains his spark crystal. Wired Magazine once nominated him as one 12 most ridiculous Transformers of all time. While silly looking, Heinrad has an ability called Time Freeze, where he can stop time around him. This drains Heinrad’s energy however, so he can only use it for about 30 seconds. *Mach Kick Mach-Kick was second-in-command of the Thoroughbred Corps, which has since been destroyed. He has copious battlefield experience and stores of all manner of wisdom. His Elastic Hand attack, which shoots out the horse's head from his arm, is amazingly destructive, while his Tail Tomahawk, a combination axe/whip, can slice an enemy in two. He transforms into a black horse. *Rockbuster Rockbuster has a hard shell that provides endurance for the character in battle. His Claw Buster and Crush Claw are powerful weapons that destroy armor. He transforms into a crab, despite the fact that crustaceans are traditional considered Predacon beast forms. The toy version is a repaint of Beast Wars Predacon Razorclaw. *Randy Once Randy sets his heart on something he plunges at it headlong, turning for his target and charging it recklessly with amazing power. He is highly patient and honest, yet with his rather serious personality he is unable to feel at home in a group, and is now a freelance Maximal, acting as a soldier for hire. His only firepower is his Charge Buster weapon. He transforms into a boar. The toy version is a redesign of Beast Wars Maximal Razorbeast. *Sharp Edge While a bit short on sense, Sharp Edge is the scary type who will charge right in without thinking too deeply once he receives an order. He believes that continuing to fight is proof that you're alive. He has a capacity for incredible speed, and the powerful cutter hidden in his flukes, known as Diamondtail, is his highly deadly ultimate weapon. He transforms into a sawshark. The toy is a remold of the popular Beast Wars Cybershark. *Bump Exceedingly reserved of character, Bump is the type who pinches every credit he gets. Others think of him as gloomy, but he's happiest when curled up and retreated into his own world. He has strong, shell-like skin, and displays a lightning-fast draw-and-fire technique with the weapons at his hips. He transforms into an armadillo. The toy is a slight redesign of Beast Wars Maximal Armordillo. *Survive Superbly capable as an assault commander. His partner, True One, is a bat-shaped forced reconnaissance scout. He has a disagreeable impression of Big Convoy, who prefers solo actions, and hopes one day to put the Maximal Commander into his own team and retrain him as a team player. Survive transforms into a bear. The toy is a repaint of Beast Wars Maximal Polar Claw. = Others = *Navi Navi is the Maximals' navigational computer. Predacons The Predacons in Beast Wars Neo are referred to as \\"Destrons\\" in Japan, the same name given to the Decepticons in Japan. *Magmatron Leader of the Predacons. Magmatron's beast mode is a chimera that involves three dinosaurs: Landsaurus, Skysaurus, and Seasaurus. He is capable of separating his beast mode into its component parts, with each dinosaur able to operate independently - however they cannot transform on their own, making Magmatron a rare \\"reverse-combiners\\" in Transformer history. *Guiledart He is Magmatron's right-hand man, acting as a supporter of reason and can construct various operations as a tactician. The Thunder Horn blast he releases from his horns can heavily damage an enemy, while his tail can become a Tail Shooter, which fires powerful missiles. The ambitious type, he is watching for his chance to advance in the ranks. He transforms into a Triceratops, and was later recolored into Triceradon and Dinobot Slag. *Saberback Saberback is a mysterious being who turned into a black and purple Stegosaurus, crafty and a liar by nature. Using his tail, he disguises himself as a flower to lure in enemies. Using the Triple Claw, the sharp talons in his right hand, at full power, he fires Laser Burn beams. One of his joys is making fun of Sling. Saberback was later recolored into Striker and Dinobot Snarl. *Sling Sling's right arm becomes a Tail Bunker to pierce through his enemies, while his left becomes the Sling Shield for protection. He transforms into a Dimetrodon. The toy was later recolored into Dinobot Sludge. *Dead End Dead End is a model soldier who loves battle. Being cool and solitary of temperament, he doesn't care for joint operations. His cruelty is such that he can bring his enemy to a halt with the Spiral Bomb attack, which launches the shell off his right shoulder, then smile as he delivers the final blow with his Dead Gun. He transforms into an ammonite, despite the fact that mollusks are considered a Maximal beast form. *Archadis A stylish snob, Archadis worries over how many feathers he loses in battle. He is highly cunning and talkative. His wings are armed with Wing Gundreads, rapid-fire cannons, and can drop Wing Bombs. He prides himself on his abundance of firearms, including the Founder Shot in his right arm. He transforms into an Archaeopteryx. Archadis' toy was later remolded into Beast Machines Dinobot Airraptor. *Killerpunch Killerpunch is the best intelligence gatherer of the Predacons, specializing in laying out all manner of traps based on the information he gains, then lying in wait and launching attacks that outwit his opposition. His Head Punch isn't just an attack; it also has a homing function and lets no information escape its sight, making it feared by friend and foe alike. He transforms into a Styracosaurus and is a remold of Guiledart. *Hydra Hydra oddly transforms into a Pteranodon and not a snake, despite his name. He hates being left alone. Unfortunately for him he has been stationed by himself on a distant bunker in the middle of nowhere. He can be very friendly, often a little too friendly. His joyful attitude around other Predacons tends to weird his guests out. In an almost pathetic turn of events his best friend happens to be the maid droid stationed with him at his bunker. Being his only companion, he is very protective of it. Hydra may suffer from cabin fever but he is still a talented warrior whom the Predacon’s can always count on when they need additional support. He is a repaint of the Beast Wars Predacon Terrorsaur; the mold was also used for Fractyl and Swoop/Terranotron. *Crazybolt Crazybolt is slow and sometimes seems low on strength, but is the Predacon's fastest escape artist. When danger approaches, he spreads his frill and heads for the hills. His tail rifle is powerful enough to blast through even the hull of a mighty spaceship. He also tends to prattle and has a swindler's disposition.. He transforms into a Frill-necked Lizard. He is a repaint of the Beast Wars Predacon Iguanus. *Bazooka A rarity among Predacons, Bazooka is serious and single-minded, a rustic samurai type who will not renege on anything he's said. Even Magmatron trusts him for this. Using the hammer-like lump attached to the end of his tail, Bazooka smashes open enemy head modules with his Gigaton Stamp. He transforms into an Ankylosaurus and was recolored into Dinobot Slapper. *Hardhead Hardhead's uses his Head Attack to confront his enemies. Hardhead also wields a Pilesaber blade. He transforms into a Pachycephalosaurus. Hardhead is depicted as a dumb but tough warrior who must constantly be ordered around to keep him in line. He is portrayed with low intelligence. Hardhead has a tough time even staying on task long enough to finish a sentence. He can be easily fooled and needs to be constantly reminded of exactly what he’s supposed to be doing. Headhead is a slight retooling and repainting of the Beast Wars Maximal/Predacon Dinobot and was later repainted again as the much better known Beast Machines Dinobot Dinotron. = Others = *DNAVI DNAVI is a dragonfly-shaped navigational computer.  Blentrons  *Unicron Unicron is the leader of the Blentrons. He possesses the body of Galvatron from Beast Wars II. *Drancron A recolor of the Beast Wars Predacon Sky Shadow. *Elphaorpha Possesses the form of an orca whale and an elephant fused together. Takes pride in his enormous tusks. When he becomes angry, a powerful acidic liquid secretes from his body. Can penetrate any type of material with his Killer Tusks; shoots a liquid from his Killer Shooter that liquefies any material on contact. Recolored from Beast Wars Maximal Torca. *Rartorata He possesses the form of a Lionfish and a hornet fused together; and uses a rapid-fire poison arrow launcher. The toy version is a remold of Beast Wars Predacon Injector.

The \\"dream\\" term has been known to largely influence house music in general, and therefore the subgenre is also known as dream house or dream dance on some occasions. Today, dream trance is considered to be the first and the most primitive derivative of the Progressive house movement that started around 1992. Many psytrance producers emergent at the time (notably Infected Mushroom) were also influenced by it. Definition The key element of dream trance resides in catchy and deep melodies of such tracks, typically played on an acoustic instrument (piano, violin, saxophone, etc.) that are mastered and then sampled onto an electronic beat structure. The melodies are considered \\"dreamy\\", i.e. tending to alter the listener's mind, hence the name. Origins The creation of dream trance was a response to social pressures in Italy during the early 1990s; the growth of rave culture among young adults, and the ensuing popularity of nightclub attendance, had created a weekly trend of deaths due to car accidents as clubbers drove across the country overnight, falling asleep at the wheel from strenuous dancing as well as alcohol and drug use. In mid-1996, deaths due to this phenomenon, called strage del sabato sera (\\"Saturday night slaughter\\") in Italy, were being estimated at around 2000 since the start of the 1990s. \\"Children\\" by Robert Miles is one of the pioneering tracks of the genre and was created due to these accidents. The move by DJs such as Miles to play slower, calming music to conclude a night's set, as a means to counteract the fast-paced, repetitive tracks that preceded, was met with approval by authorities and parents of car crash victims. Structure Dream trance uses dance beats similar to those of the Eurodance and dance-pop genres rather than genuine trance beats mixed into 4-to-4 bass patterns with a particularly repetitive sound. The focus of the music is primarily on the melody rather than the beat, resulting in a trance-like melody and a house-like beat. The rhythm structure is also very simple, however, as stated before, all the importance is accented in instrumental strings that derive on various notes and shape the songs. Therefore, the style is very similar to trance in its general consistence, with the only difference being a constant, house-like progression.

(2007). The term is used as a descriptive label for bilateral foreign relations between Imperial China and Joseon dynasty Korea. Sadae is also understood as relevant in understanding pre-Joseon diplomacy. Etymology The historical term is derived from the Chinese shi da (Korean, sadae) as used by the philosopher Mencius. Sadae literally means \\"dealing with the great\\" or \\"serving the great.\\"Pratt, Keith L. et al. (1999). Korea: a historical and cultural dictionary, p. 394. The neutral term is distinguished from the pejorative \\"sadaejuui\\", which was invented by early 20th century Korean nationalists.Mitchell, Anthony. \\"Happier Economy Better Than Larger Economy,\\" Korea Times (Seoul). October 12, 2008. The genesis of the term \\"sadae\\" arises in the work of the Chinese philosopher Mencius: Mencius - Liang Hui Wang II Overview Sadae describes a foreign policy characterized by the various ways a small country acknowledges the strength of a greater power like that of China. Sadae is made manifest in the actions of the weaker state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys. The utility of the sadae concept in Korea was recognized from the period of Three Kingdoms of Korea to 1895; and it is demonstrated in the relationship of mid-Joseon Korea towards the Ming Dynasty of China.구도영 (Koo Do-young). 중종대(中宗代) 사대인식(事大認識)의 변화 - 대례의(大禮議)에 대한 별행(別行) 파견 논의를 중심으로 (\\"Changes regarding ‘Perception of Sadae’(事大認識) that became apparent during the reign of King Jungjong - Examination of Discussions over the issue of dispatching a special envoy(別行) about the Grand ceremony (大禮議) in Ming (明) dynasty’s court\\"),] 역사와 현실 제62호, 2006.12 (History and Reality, No. 62, December 2006). pp. 3-405. The Joseon Dynasty made every effort to maintain a friendly relationship with Beijing for reasons having to do with realpolitik and with an idealized Confucian worldview. Sadae construes China as the center of a Confucian moral universe.Mansourov, Alexandre Y. \\"Will Flowers Bloom without Fragrance? Korean-Chinese Relations,\\" Harvard Asia Quarterly (Spring 2009). As a foundation of diplomacy, the Joseon kingdom presumed that the Korean state was positioned within a Sinocentristic milieu. The Joseon foreign policy was organized around maintaining stable Joseon-Chinese relations in the period from 1392 through 1895. The concept of sadae is contrasted with limited trade relationships or kyorin diplomacy (교린정책; lit. \\"neighborly relations\\") which marked Joseon-Japanese relations in this period.Kang, Etsuko H. (1997). Diplomacy and Ideology in Japanese-Korean Relations: from the Fifteenth to the Eighteenth Century, p. 49. =20th century re-interpretation= The concept of sadae was rejected in the writings of polemicist Shin Chaeho and other Korean nationalists in the 20th century.Robinson, Michael.

He began his career at his father's bakery as a teenager and went on to serve as head baker at a number of hotels around Britain and internationally. After returning from working in Cyprus, Hollywood began appearing in guest spots on a number of British television programmes on both BBC and ITV. Although Hollywood's broadcast career began with food programming he has since branched out into other genres, including motoring. Early life, education and early career Paul John Hollywood was born in 1966 in Wallasey, \\"Wallasey baker Paul Hollywood described affair as 'the biggest mistake of my life'\\", Liverpool Echo, 30 October 2013 \\"Wallasey-born Bake Off star Paul Hollywood issues Top Gear charity race challenge\\", Wirral Globe, 22 August 2016 Wirral, Cheshire, the son of bakery proprietor John F. Hollywood and Gillian M. Harman. He was a pupil at The Mosslands School. Hollywood studied sculpture at the Wallasey School of Art but left the school to start work as a baker. He first worked in his father's bakery in York (the headquarters of a chain called Bread Winner which eventually stretched all the way down the east coast from Aberdeen to Lincolnshire) and then in other bakeries on Merseyside. He eventually went on to become head baker at a number of hotels including The Dorchester, Chester Grosvenor and Spa, and the Cliveden Hotel. He then left the UK for Cyprus, where he worked at two resorts. Television and media career Hollywood has appeared in guest spots on a number of television programmes, including BBC One's The Generation Game, The Heaven and Earth Show, ITV's This Morning, and The Alan Titchmarsh Show. Since the show launched in 2010, Hollywood has been a judge on the BBC programme The Great British Bake Off. In this capacity, he has been described as the \\"antidote\\" to judges such as Len Goodman or Simon Cowell in other reality television programmes, on account of his straightforward and honest manner and because his judging is restricted purely to the finished product. His partnership with Mary Berry has been described in The Guardian as being the \\"secret weapon\\" of the show and potentially one of the best judging combinations to have appeared on reality television. In September 2016, Love Productions agreed to a three- year deal to move the show from the BBC to Channel 4. Hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be moving to the new network, followed shortly after by Berry. On the same day as Berry, Hollywood announced that he would be staying with the show. The Gourmand World Cookbook Awards named his 2005 book 100 Great Breads as the \\"Top Bread and Pastry Book\\" for that year. In 2008, Hollywood created an almond and roquefort sourdough recipe that was said to be the most expensive bread in Britain. The roquefort is supplied from a specialist in France at £15 per kilo, while the flour for the bread is made by a miller in Wiltshire. Hollywood describes it as a \\"Rolls- Royce of loaves\\". Hollywood is a guest speaker at several food festivals, including the Cumbrian Food Festival, and the BBC Good Food Show and the Cake and Bake Show, both in London. In May 2013, Hollywood began appearing as a judge on The American Baking Competition on CBS. Hollywood has also starred in Sadie J, a children's television programme. In 2013, he presented Paul Hollywood’s Bread on BBC Two, in which he gave advice on recipes for different types of bread; however, also featured on the series were recipes for some cakes such as the Danish pastry. He also presented Paul Hollywood's Pies and Puds, a cookery television series on BBC One. In August 2015 Hollywood was featured on the BBC genealogy documentary series Who Do You Think You Are? The programme revealed that his grandfather Norman Harman, who served in the Army during World War II, saw action in the Tunisia Campaign and at the Battle of Anzio and that his great-great-grandfather, Kenneth MacKenzie, had been a policeman in the City of Glasgow Police in the 1850s. Hollywood's great-great- great-grandfather, Donald MacKenzie, had been a crofter in Poolewe, Wester Ross. Donald had also been the post-runner between Poolewe and Dingwall, where he delivered post on foot over a distance of . He covered this distance every week, during his forties, on foot for over a decade. He lived into his 80s. In May and June 2017 he presented Paul Hollywood's Big Continental Road Trip. In December 2017, Hollywood appeared as a judge on The Great American Baking Show, the second incarnation of the GBBO series in the United States. Motor racing In 2015 Hollywood began his racing career, making his debut in the Beechdean AMR Aston Martin Vantage GT4 with Andrew Howard, founder of Beechdean Dairies. The pair qualified second in the Britcar Trophy Championship's first round at Silverstone taking second in class in both races.tsl-timing.com, Britcar Trophy Championship, Silverstone, 03/29/2015 He also competed at Le Mans in 2015 in the Aston Martin festival. Hollywood has also competed in GT Cup with Jonny Adam and finished first in class. He entered the British GT championship in 2016 and competed in the last three rounds with Jamie Chadwick as his driving partner. In July 2017 he came first in class at the Dunlop endurance race at Silverstone in an Aston Martin GT4, and in November 2017 he raced in his first 24 hr race at Circuit of the Americas coming second in class in an Aston Martin GT8. Personal life Hollywood met his future wife, Alexandra (Alex), in Cyprus where he was a head baker at a five star hotel and she was a scuba diving instructor. They later married on the island. Hollywood and Alex separated in 2013, after he admitted to an affair with his The American Baking Competition co-host Marcela Valladolid, reconciled, then separated again in November 2017. In August 2019 Hollywood split from 24-year-old girlfriend Summer Monteys-Fullam, ending a two-year relationship.

Written by the one-time Detroit Free Press journalist Robert Barr (known in the Press as 'Luke Sharp') it is both an indictment of an age gone by in which discipline and religion slide towards perversion and voyeurism, and a reminiscence of an innocent time before the great conflicts of the twentieth century, a time in which respect, delicacy and modesty prevailed in the relationships between man and woman, student and teacher. A complex and forgotten masterpiece of observation, whimsy and melodrama, it is reminiscent both of Mark Twain and Booth Tarkington.

It is a term used in the context of rehabilitation medicine and physical therapy. Kinesiophobia is a factor that hinders rehabilitation and actually prolongs disability and pain. Kinesiophobia can be a factor in increased time to return to participation in pre-injury activities. It has been shown that higher levels of kinesiophobia are linked to a lack of re-entry into pre-injury activities. Research has been conducted to explore the level of association between kinesiophobia and pain in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). The evidence this study presents reveals that there is a connection between a greater degree of kinesiophobia and greater levels of pain intensity. The study has also found moderate evidence between a greater level of kinesiophobia and higher levels of pain severity and quality of life among CMP sufferers. These results suggest that clinicians should consider kinesiophobia as an important factor in their preliminary assessment of CMP patients A 2020 meta-analysis showed that exercise training is effective for reducing kinesiophobia, including in people with low back pain.

Born in Howard County, Indiana, Kitchel grew up in a rural part of Cass County, Indiana, honing his skills on a makeshift court in a tool shed. As a senior, Kitchel led tiny Lewis Cass High School to a 20-0 regular season record and its first sectional title in 1978. Kitchel averaged 26.2 points and 13 rebounds per game as he was graduated as the school's leading scorer. He committed to play collegiately at Indiana University for the legendary Bobby Knight. His freshman season in 1978–79 was limited to one game due to injury and Kitchel watched from the bench as the Hoosiers won the 1979 National Invitation Tournament. Kitchel came back the next season in a reserve role, then became a starter in 1980–81, averaging 9.2 points and 3.3 rebounds per game on the 1981 National Championship squad. The next two seasons, Kitchel became one of the stars of the Hoosiers. He averaged 19.6 and 17.3 points per game as a junior and senior, leading the team in scoring in 1981–82 and finishing second to Randy Wittman his senior year. Kitchel was named All-Big Ten and All-America both years as he led the Hoosiers to NCAA Tournament appearances in each season. In the Summer following his junior year, Kitchel and IU teammate Jim Thomas were named to the USA men's national team for the 1982 FIBA World Championship in Cali, Colombia.

The church was formerly pastored by Jack Hayford and was widely influential in the Charismatic Movement in the 1970s through the 1990s, with services regularly televised on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and aired on its own local radio station. The church is related to several other churches of a similar name in Southern California, including La Iglesia En El Camino in Van Nuys, California and The Church On The Way, Santa Clarita in Santa Clarita, California. The Hollywood Cross, a landmark in Hollywood, California, is owned by the church. History In 1926, a group of students from Life Bible College (now Life Pacific College) started a tent revival on Friar Street in Van Nuys, California. These prayer meetings developed into a church, which in the following year, was moved to a newly built facility on Erwin Street. In 1949, the church began building a new sanctuary, still located at 14344 Sherman Way, and completed it in 1951 with a marching band celebration down Van Nuys Blvd. By 1969, the aging church had been reduced to a small number of elderly members. When Howard Carson, senior pastor at the time, became ill and decided to step down, Jack Hayford was appointed by the Foursquare Church as interim pastor. In 1971, he accepted the position as permanent senior pastor. Following Hayford's appointment, the church grew significantly. By 1974, the sanctuary had to be remodeled to increase capacity, and in 1981 the current sanctuary at 14300 Sherman Way was built. In 1987, as the church continued to outgrow its facilities, the church initiated the purchase of 14800 Sherman Way from the First Baptist Church of Van Nuys. In 1999, when Jack Hayford retired, his son-in-law, Scott Bauer, was installed as his successor, serving as senior pastor until his sudden death in 2003. Between 2004 and 2010, Jim Tolle served as senior pastor of both the English and Spanish speaking congregations, and in 2011 Ricky Temple pastored the English speaking congregation for a year until 2013, when Tim Clark was named as senior pastor of the church, his term beginning in early 2014.

Concentration parameters occur in two kinds of distribution: In the Von Mises–Fisher distribution, and in conjunction with distributions whose domain is a probability distribution, such as the symmetric Dirichlet distribution and the Dirichlet process. The rest of this article focuses on the latter usage. The larger the value of the concentration parameter, the more evenly distributed is the resulting distribution (the more it tends towards the uniform distribution). The smaller the value of the concentration parameter, the more sparsely distributed is the resulting distribution, with most values or ranges of values having a probability near zero (in other words, the more it tends towards a distribution concentrated on a single point, the degenerate distribution defined by the Dirac delta function). Dirichlet distribution In the case of multivariate Dirichlet distributions, there is some confusion over how to define the concentration parameter. In the topic modelling literature, it is often defined as the sum of the individual Dirichlet parameters, when discussing symmetric Dirichlet distributions (where the parameters are the same for all dimensions) it is often defined to be the value of the single Dirichlet parameter used in all dimensions. This second definition is smaller by a factor of the dimension of the distribution. A concentration parameter of 1 (or k, the dimension of the Dirichlet distribution, by the definition used in the topic modelling literature) results in all sets of probabilities being equally likely, i.e., in this case the Dirichlet distribution of dimension k is equivalent to a uniform distribution over a k-1-dimensional simplex. Note that this is not the same as what happens when the concentration parameter tends towards infinity. In the former case, all resulting distributions are equally likely (the distribution over distributions is uniform). In the latter case, only near- uniform distributions are likely (the distribution over distributions is highly peaked around the uniform distribution). Meanwhile, in the limit as the concentration parameter tends towards zero, only distributions with nearly all mass concentrated on one of their components are likely (the distribution over distributions is highly peaked around the k possible Dirac delta distributions centered on one of the components, or in terms of the k-dimensional simplex, is highly peaked at corners of the simplex). Sparse prior An example of where a sparse prior (concentration parameter much less than 1) is called for, consider a topic model, which is used to learn the topics that are discussed in a set of documents, where each \\"topic\\" is described using a categorical distribution over a vocabulary of words. A typical vocabulary might have 100,000 words, leading to a 100,000-dimensional categorical distribution. The prior distribution for the parameters of the categorical distribution would likely be a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. However, a coherent topic might only have a few hundred words with any significant probability mass. Accordingly, a reasonable setting for the concentration parameter might be 0.01 or 0.001. With a larger vocabulary of around 1,000,000 words, an even smaller value, e.g. 0.0001, might be appropriate.

The Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries comments that it \\"portrays an impoverished family, whose income comes from peddling trinkets\\", but \\"the best qualities of the first play are absent.\\" The novelist Jeanette Winterson, though, has commented that the contemporary reviews of these first two plays' first performances \\"read like a depressing essay in sexism\\". See also the article by Samantha Ellis Sweetly Sings the Donkey, a collection of short stories, appeared in 1963. A Taste of Honey was adapted into a film of the same title, released in 1961. Delaney wrote the screenplay with the director, Tony Richardson. According to Phil Wickham, writing for the website Screenonline, the film script \\"contrives to keep in Delaney's best lines while creating a cinematic rather than a theatrical experience\\" It won the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay and the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award in 1962. Delaney's other screenplays include The White Bus, Charlie Bubbles (both 1967) and Dance with a Stranger (1985). She also wrote the BBC series \\"The House That Jack Built\\" (1977), which she later adapted as an Off- Off-Broadway play in 1979. In 1985 Delaney was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Delaney wrote several radio plays, including Tell Me a Film (2003), Country Life (2004) and its sequel Whoopi Goldberg's Country Life, which was broadcast in The Afternoon Play slot on BBC Radio 4 in June 2010. =Death= Delaney died from breast cancer and heart failure, five days before her 73rd birthday, at the home of her daughter Charlotte in Suffolk, England. She is survived by her daughter and three grandchildren. Legacy In 1986 the Smiths' lead singer and lyricist Morrissey said, \\"I've never made any secret of the fact that at least 50 per cent of my reason for writing can be blamed on Shelagh Delaney.\\" The lyrics of \\"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\\" are a retelling of the plot of A Taste of Honey, using many direct quotations from the play. Morrissey chose a photo of Delaney as the artwork on the album cover for the Smiths' 1987 compilation album, Louder Than Bombs, as well as the single \\"Girlfriend In A Coma\\". A biography of Delaney by Selina Todd, Tastes of Honey, was published in 2019.

Biography After Thessaly's ruler John II Doukas (r. 1303–1318) died in 1318 without a male heir, the Byzantine Empire moved to take advantage of the power vacuum in the region. Byzantine troops under John Kantakouzenos occupied northern Thessaly, while the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens moved into the southern parts of the region. Central Thessaly became a battleground for the various local magnates, who competed with each other and called upon the two states for aid.. One of those who turned to Byzantium for support was Gabrielopoulos, who possessed many estates in western Thessaly as well as in parts of southwestern Macedonia, his lands reaching from Trikala to Kastoria. Sometime between 1318 and 1325, he acknowledged Byzantine suzerainty and was given the title of sebastokrator in return. He thus became the de facto governor of much of Thessaly on behalf of the Byzantine emperor, but preserving much local autonomy. His possessions included the towns and fortresses of Trikala, Phanarion, Stagoi, Damasis, and Elasson... After his death in 1332/3, however, his heirs began quarrelling amongst themselves, leading to an invasion by the Epirote ruler John II Orsini, while the Byzantines under Andronikos III Palaiologos (r. 1328–1341) moved in and established direct control over the northern and eastern part of the region. With Orsini's death three years later, all of Thessaly came under Byzantine control..

He is widely renowned as a master of lithography. Early in his career, he was a successful illustrator for children's books. His work during World War II earned him the State Stalin Prize. He later became a professor of art and was named a People's Artist of the USSR. Early life Pakhomov was born into a peasant family in a small village. Pakhomov's father was elected as village head, so the Alexei had access to paper. He began to draw himself. People came to see his drawings, and soon a local landlord, Zubov, invited him to visit. During those visits Zubov gave the boy drawing paper and crayons, and he showed him pictures of Surikov and Repin. When the boy finished primary education at the village school, Zubov arranged for Alexei to go to high school in Kadnikov. =Training= Mstislav Dobuzhinsky, one of Pakhomov's teachers. In 1915, Zubov's father, former actor Y. Zubov, collected money for Pakhomov to study in Petrograd at Stieglitz Art School, where his teachers were N. Shukhaev, Sergey Chekhonin, Mstislav Dobuzhinsky and Alexander Savinov. He remained there until 1917. From 1921, the young artist studied at the Vkhutemas under V. Lebedev, N. Tyrsa and A. Karev. Due to the October Revolution and the Russian civil war, Pakhomov's studies were drawn out until 1925, when he graduated the Vkhutemas. In 1921-1923 he joined the Circle of Artists movement. Art =Children's book illustrations= Though Pakhomov made a number of colorful, monumental easel paintings, he was first and foremost a graphic artist, renowned for his huge contribution to the illustration of children's books. The warm glow of his idyllic childhood years found its way into images of peasant children, a simple life he depicted with masterful ease. In the 1920s he made trips to Young Pioneer summer camps, to study children and their special plasticity and expression in natural surroundings. Soviet illustrators had virtually revolutionized the approach to children's book illustration. The images of old were replaced with dynamic, colorful and emotional pictures which lived in the text instead of accompanying it. At the same time fonts and covers were also considered and designed. Pakhomov co-founded the Artists' Society in 1926. He participated in all of the Society's exhibitions until 1931. Pakhomov's work reached Japan in 1927, when his work were put up at an exhibition of Soviet art in Osaka. Shortly after that he began working with the magazines Chizh and Ezh. He also made illustrations for E. L. Schwartz's, S. Marshak's and G. Krutov's children's books. =Response to criticism= In the first half of the 1930s Pakhomov found himself in a difficult situation in view of the narrowing official view of art and the Soviet campaign against \\"formalism\\". His paintings, where half-nude, young men and women are tanning in the sun were made the object of severe criticism. The artist had to choose whether to give up his professional principles or some parts of his art. He chose the latter, concentrating on graphic work and limiting himself even more by almost completely giving up color in his illustrations. =World War II= When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, there was a need for propaganda placards and posters calling citizens to aid the war effort. Pakhomov hurried to Leningrad to do what he could to help. In July 1941, he helped dig anti-tank moats at Moloskovitza station. During the next three years Pakhomov remained in the besieged Leningrad. Between 1942 and 1944 he produced the a series of lithographs, Leningrad in the Days of the Blockade, in which he strove to bring forward and the very real emotion of the siege of Leningrad; the uniqueness of this particular setting of place and time; the human suffering and strong spirit. The series earned him the State Stalin Prize in 1946. During the siege, his workshop was hit by a bomb which came through the roof, smashed through the floor and blew up two floors below. It destroyed a lot of his works. The Russian Institute of Blood Transfusions asked him to cooperate, and there he met Vladimir Konashevich, V. Dvorakovsky and Dmitry Mitrokhin. He received a poster-making order from V. Serov, who was chairman of the Leningrad Union of Artists at the time. =Postwar work= Pakhomov (first row, third from left) at an exhibition of his art in Berlin, 1971. Between 1944 and 1947, Pakhomov worked on the series In our City, in which the artist strove to reflect the grand scale of the postwar effort to rebuild ruined Leningrad and to reinstate its formerly vibrant life. The presence of female workers in every traditionally male trade is a reminder of the recent war, which killed millions of Russians. In 1948, he began teaching at the Il’ya Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture; he became a professor the following year. In the final period of his work, in the 1950s-1960s, Pakhomov tried to revive his work after it became a bit too dry, perhaps too influenced by the strongly dogmatic requirements of post-war Russia. In the 1960s he even returned to the use of color, but his work during this period did not gain much critical acclaim. Pakhomov died 14 April 1973.

All this is true to the original tale narrated by the fictional hero Orpheus as recorded by Ovid in Book X of his Metamorphoses.

Available here .While at least one oil field in California, such as Elk Hills, currently produce more natural gas overall, Rio Vista is the largest \\"non-associated\\" gas field, i.e. it produces gas not associated with oil. As of 2009, the primary operator on the field was Rosetta Resources of Houston, Texas, which owned 171 of the field's 189 active wells. The remaining 18 were run by several smaller operators, including Towne Exploration, Royale Energy, and Tri-Valley Oil & Gas.DOGGR (2008), pp. 149, 150, 160 Geographic setting The gas field underlies portions of Solano, Sacramento, and Contra Costa Counties, in the bottomlands of the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta as well as some adjacent upland areas in the Montezuma Hills. The town of Rio Vista is entirely surrounded by the gas field, and the large 3000-home Trilogy retirement community, north of Rio Vista, is on the field's northern boundary. Additionally, the city of Isleton is on the gas field near its eastern border with the River Island Gas Field. Several state highways intersect the field, providing primary surface transportation through the area. California State Route 12 crosses the gas field from west to east, bridging the Sacramento and Mokelumne Rivers; and California State Routes 84 and 160 cross the field from north to south, with Route 160 built on levees much of the way. Much of the field underlies islands in the Delta, some of which are accessible only by ferry. Included in the gas field are Bradford Island, Twitchell Island, Brannon Island, Andrus Island, and parts of Tyler, Sherman, and Decker Islands. Most of the land area within these islands – much of which is below sea level – consists of agricultural fields protected by levees constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Drilling and maintenance pads for the gas wells are interspersed among agricultural fields, recreational areas, vacation homes, and waterways. Elevations on the gas field range from around in the Montezuma Hills southwest of Rio Vista to around ten feet below sea level in parts of the Delta islands protected by levees. Ground has been slowly subsiding in these areas for decades, due to a combination of peat decomposition, groundwater removal, and compaction of the underlying geologic structures from which trillions of cubic feet of gas have been removed.Steven J.

Freezes occur occasionally during the winter, with the freeze-free period encompassing 250 to 275 days. Drainage on the field is poor except in the Montezuma Hills, in which it is to the south and southeast towards the Sacramento River via ephemeral streams which dry up completely in the summer.

Wide variations in porosity and permeability within these sedimentary rock layers, along with abundant structural and stratigraphic traps, have allowed for the formation of numerous natural gas reservoirs in the Basin. These reservoirs have filled with gas by slow accumulation, with gas migrating from distant source rock over millions of years. The Rio Vista, at the southern end of the Sacramento Basin, is the largest of these regional gas fields.Leslie B. Magoon and Zenon C.

Overall the field is an anticlinal structure somewhat akin to a dome, with its axis running northwest to southeast. One large fault, the Midland Fault, cuts through the middle of the field from north to south, and numerous small faults intersect the field elsewhere. Vertical offset along the Midland Fault of the Domengine Formation, one of the major gas-bearing rock units, is up to 500 feet.Frame, R.G.

This was the only zone to produce gas until 1943. Development of the field picked up rapidly during the Second World War. Since oil tankers were being appropriated in the San Francisco Bay Area for use in the war effort, a giant gas pipeline from the Kettleman Hills field had to be converted to an oil pipeline, creating an immediate need for a gas supply closer to the urban center.Frame, p. 13 The timing was perfect, as the Rio Vista field was proving to be enormous as each new well came in, and by the end of November, 1944, there were 70 active gas wells in the new field.Frame, p. 6 Peak production was the next year, with over of gas being withdrawn from the field in 1945.DOGGR, p. 1379 The field was unitized in 1965. Amerada Petroleum became the principal operator, although a few scattered smaller operators remained active on the field, mainly on the outlying portions. In 1969 Amerada Petroleum merged with Hess Oil and Chemical Corporation, acquiring its present name of Amerada Hess Corporation. Amerada Hess continued to operate much of the field until January 1999, at which time they sold it to Sheridan Energy, Inc. Sheridan only held the field for part of the year, selling it to Calpine Natural Gas Co. (now Calpine Corporation) in October 1999. When Calpine filed for bankruptcy in 2005, Rosetta Resources Inc. formed for the purpose of acquiring the oil and gas resources of Calpine; they took over operation in July 2005, and continue to run the field as of 2010.Rosetta Resources, Inc.

Available here.FWP filed by Rosetta Resources with the Securities and Exchange Commission, October 4, 2006, p. 4. Occasional conflicts have occurred over land use in the field. While developers of the 3,000-home Trilogy retirement community north of Rio Vista owned surface rights to the land they intended to use for the planned community, Amerada Hess retained mineral rights, and their successor Calpine desired to drill new gas wells in the same region. As of 2010, only one active well (\\"Marks No. 7\\") is adjacent to the community – northeast of State Route 12 at the corner of Church Road and Marks Road.Michael Peña, \\"Natural gas hunt may surface in Rio Vista\\".

Several gigatons of carbon dioxide could conceivably be pumped into the depleted reservoir, serving three purposes: 1) to offset atmospheric emissions; 2) to assist in natural gas recovery, by increasing reservoir pressure; and 3) to mitigate subsidence of the overlying land, which is slowly collapsing into the vacated space, as is common over depleted petroleum fields.California Geological Survey.

It was first published in 1617 in the eighth part of Lope de Vega's Comedias. Based on the tenth tale of the eighth day of Boccaccio’s Decameron, it has been called a picaresque play, works that exhibit an uncharacteristic moral freedom. Joan Oleza. “Las comedias de pícaro de Lope de Vega: una propuesta de subgénero,” Comedias y comediantes. Estudio sobre el teatro clásico español, ed. Manuel Diego y Teresa Ferrer. Universitat de Valencia, 1991: 165-87. It focuses on merchants, the circulation of bodies and merchandise, and the seductive power of art. Frederick A. de Armas, “El mercader y la cortesana: arte, cuerpo y comercio en El anzuelo de Fenisa de Lope de Vega,” El poder de la economía: la imagen de los mercaderes y el comercio en el mundo hispánico de los siglos XVI y XVII, ed. Christoph Strosetzki. Biblioteca Áurea Hispánica 123. Madrid / Frankfurt: Iberoamericana Vervuert, 2018: 229-46. Boccaccio's tale is about a trickster who is trickedDavid M. Gitlitz, “Introduction” to El anzuelo de Fenisa. San Antonio: Trinity University Press, 1988, p. x Lope uses Boccaccio's story for the main plot of his play, where Fenisa, a courtesan in Palermo attempts to woo the rich merchant Lucindo in order to gain his riches. A secondary plot includes Dinarda who is dressed as a man and has come to Palermo in search of the man who seduced her and left her behind. Fenisa ends up falling for this Dinarda who is disguised as don Juan de Lara. While Fenisa is able to trick Lucindo the first time around, he comes back to Sicily a second time and this time he tricks her. In the end, Dinarda finds and marries her Albano, while Fenisa is left without a spouse and without money. This is a light and comic play that opposes the mercantile values of Fenisa and Lucindo to the aristocratic attitudes of Albano and Dinarda. Fenisa's character is delightfully portrayed. But, she is more than a courtesan; she is a woman who delights in taking revenge on all men for having been betrayed by her first love.Nancy D’Antuono, Boccaccio’s Novelle in the Theater of Lope de Vega Madrid: Porrua, 1983, p. 115 She also delights in her freedom, while living in a picaresque world where the rules of the aristocracy are left behind. In spite of the intricate plot line, it is Fenisa's characterization and actions that are the center of attention in Lope's play.

Description The arjuna grows to about 20–25 metres tall; usually has a buttressed trunk, and forms a wide canopy at the crown, from which branches drop downwards. It has oblong, conical leaves which are green on the top and brown below; smooth, grey bark; it has pale yellow flowers which appear between March and June; its glabrous, 2.5 to 5 cm fibrous woody fruit, divided into five wings, appears between September and November. The tree does not suffer from any major diseases or pests, but it is susceptible to Phyllactinia terminale and rot due to polystictus affinis. Distribution and habitat The arjuna is seen across the Indian Subcontinent, and usually found growing on river banks or near dry river beds in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and south and central India, along with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It is known as matthimara in Kannada, neer maruthu in Malayalam 'marutha maram' (marutham pattai) in Tamil, thella maddi (తెల్ల మద్ది) in Telugu and kohda in Rajasthan, Kumbuk in Sinhala. It has also been planted in Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya. Importance =Silk production= The arjuna is one of the species whose leaves are fed on by the Antheraea paphia moth which produces the tassar silk, a wild silk of commercial importance. =Siddha and Ayurvedic medicine= The arjuna was introduced into siddha by saint Agastiyar through his prose Gunavakatam and in Ayurveda as a treatment for heart disease by Vagbhata (c. 7th century CE). It is traditionally prepared as a milk decoction. In the Ashtānga Hridayam, but was also mentioned in many ancient Hindu vedas, and was a known practice for thousands of years, passed down by tradition, before vagbhata mentioned it in his writings. Vagbhata mentions arjuna in the treatment of wounds, hemorrhages and ulcers, applied topically as a powder. The Arjuna plant (lat. Terminalia arjuna) has traditionally been used to treat heart disease for centuries, which is why it got the nickname “Guardian of the heart.” The hero of the famous epic “Mahabharata”, was named after this tree because of its protective effects. =In Buddhism= In Theravada Buddhism, Arjuna is said to have been used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by the tenth Buddha (title) called \\"Anomadassi Buddha\\". =Gallery= Terminalia_arjuna.jpg|Terminalia arjuna Terminalia_arjuna_trunk_01_by_Line1.JPG|Terminalia arjuna middle trunk Terminalia_arjuna_leaves_01_by_Line1.JPG|Terminalia arjuna leaves Terminalia arjuna-1.jpg|Terminalia arjuna in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore Terminalia arjuna DSC 0267.JPG|The bark of Terminalia arjuna (অর্জুন) is found in Bana Bitan, Kolkata, West Bengal,India References External links  * arjuna Plants used in Ayurveda Flora of the Indian subcontinent ","title":"Terminalia arjuna"},{"id":"28962814","text":"Harry Miller Lydenberg (November 18, 1874 – April 16, 1960)\\"Harry Miller Lydenberg.\\" Dictionary of American Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1980. Biography In Context. Web. 26 Sept. 2013. was an American librarian, author and book conservationist. He is best known for his decades- long career as a librarian and eventual director for the New York Public Library, American liaison to the international library community, as well as one of the 100 most important library innovators of the 20th century.Kniffel, L., Sullivan, P. & McCormick, Dec. 1999, p.43. His written works describe his preferred library reference, collection and conservation practices, as well as his knowledge of the New York Public Library. Early life Harry Miller Lydenberg was born in Dayton, Ohio. As highlighted in Phyllis Dain's biographical and historical account of Lydenberg's life, entitled, \\"Harry M. Lydenberg and American library resources: a study in modern library leadership\\", his early life necessitated that he learn what it meant to make do with very little and to conserve resources.Dain, 1977, p.452 As Lydenberg would be heard to quote later in his life, \\"Libraries as well as individuals must adjust themselves to circumstances, and will see their ideals affected by the conditions under which they try to realize those ideals.\\"Lydenberg, 1928. p.19 As he applied these words to his career and work, so too did these words encompass the way Harry Lydenberg lived his life, from his youth through his career. One of his earliest jobs, delivering newspapers, set the stage for what would be a long career working with the written word, and the mechanics of printing.Dain, 1977, p.452 In his later teen years, Lydenberg worked as a page for the Dayton Public Library, eventually going on to attend Harvard, where he continued to work in the college library, gaining knowledge of library organization and the importance of a well tended library collection.Metcalf, K.D. 1976, p.339 He graduated a year early in 1896 from his four-year program, while simultaneously earning the title of magna cum laude.Dain, 1977, p.452. New beginnings at the New York Public Library Upon graduating, Lydenberg gained employment with the New York Public Library (NYPL). The director, John Shaw Billings, took notice of Lydenberg's demonstrated dedication to the library field.Metcalf, K.D. 1976, p.339 According to Dain and verified by the 1916 Handbook of the New York Public Library, NYPL was experiencing a major consolidation, as the Lennox and Astor Libraries, through private endowments and the Tilden Trust, were merged to create the \\"new corporation\\" called the \\"New York Public Library, Astor, Lennox and Tilden Foundation\\".Dain, 1977, p.452New York Public Library, 1916, p.69 Lydenberg became Shaw's personal assistant as well as the head of reference.Dain, P.1977, p.454Metcalf, K.D. 1976, p.339 He and Shaw, along with the library's other main figure, Assistant Director Edwin H. Anderson saw the library through its early years after the consolidation.Dain, P.1977, p.454. Career advancements Lydenberg was promoted to Assistant Director in 1928.Dain, 1977, p.454 One of his main goals included building a collection that was based upon need and usability rather than quantity of ownership. In a speech entitled, “Interrelation of Medical and Public Libraries”, given to the Medical Library Association, Lydenberg exemplifies this collection development philosophy. When addressing the specific selection of medical books for NYPL, he warned against retaining or purchasing every book on medicine. Instead he added only those medical books that were interdisciplinary, and encompassed other fields of knowledge. He knew there were plenty of medical institutions that contained purely technical books, and therefore it was not necessary to have them in the public library's collection.Lydenberg, 1928, p.20 Thus, he was able meet the research needs of his patrons without accumulating materials already available in other institutions. Lydenberg goes on to address in his essay, “The opportunity beckons loud here to demonstrate how necessary is the cooperation between the general and special collection.”Lydenberg, 1928, p.20 Another of Lydenberg's areas of expertise was the preservation of books. According to his colleague, Keyes Metcalf, he oversaw multiple studies pertaining to such subjects as general conservation, paper and leather selection and temperature control.Metcalf, 1976, p.341 Additionally, he authored several books on these subjects, one of the most notable being, The Care and repair of books, which he co-authored with John Archer, who was then head of NYPL's printing officeMetcalf, 1976. p.341 Lydenberg is quoted in his own chapter of The Wonderful World of Books, (entitled, “Library Work as a Profession”) as advising: He and Archer are also credited with the generous use of early photocopying technology and color printing.Metcalf, 1976, p.341 Major accomplishments Lydenberg became the Director of NYPL in 1934.Dain, 1977, p.454 This followed his year as president of the American Library Association from 1931–1932.American Library Association website. List of 20th century presidents, website created:1997, accessed:Sept. 28th, 2010 He continued to see NYPL not only through the issues unique to the management of a large urban library, but also through years war recovery and economic uncertainty.Dain, 1977, p. 466 His tenure lasted until his retirement in 1941. For two years after, he served as director of Biblioteca Benjamín Franklin in Mexico City, Mexico.Metcalf, 1976, p.342 Lydenberg also held the position of the director of the Board of International Relations of the American Library Association from 1943–1946.Stefferud, 1953, p.315 His years as director of NYPL had prepared him well for this position, as it was a time when the United States (and most specifically public institutions) was collectively experiencing a great period of sacrifice and fiscal belt-tightening. He had previously visited Europe post World War I to study book buying and preservation practices.Dain, 1997, p.460 He felt librarians could enhance American library collections and maintenance practices by learning what other counties did with their information and physical books, especially during wartime. He acknowledged in his 1945 essay, “The Library Rehabilitation Programme of the American Library Association”, “Librarians have joyfully agreed that common efforts, concerted action, rather than rampant rivalry, are necessary in connection with future purchases when the time is ripe for what we may call ordinary buying.”Lydenberg, 2005 (reprinted from 1945) p.342 In 1952 he was awarded Honorary Membership in the American Library Association.

Plot After she files for divorce from nightclub owner Tom Wilson (Wheeler Oakman), former Broadway star Gypsy Carmen (Evelyn Brent) demands that he return the securities that she owned before their marriage. When Wilson claims that the securities are missing, Gypsy pulls a gun from her purse and aims it at him. At that moment, a gun is fired through the window of his house. Tom falls dead and Gypsy flees in panic. At the time of the murder, Jim Lindsey (Gabriel Dell), the star reporter of the American Express paper, is busily bidding on oriental rugs at an auction and consequently misses the story. Deciding to cover the murder for the absent Jim, Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey), who is working as a copy boy on the paper, asks Glimpy (Huntz Hall) to drive him to the Wilson house in the paper's delivery car. At the house, Muggs and Glimpy sneak through an open window and listen as the police interrogate Wilson's mistress, Diane Gibson (Thelma White), an entertainer at the nightclub, and Ken Duncan (Ian Keith), Wilson's manager. Duncan recalls that Gypsy threatened Wilson's life, and the police lieutenant states that a .38 caliber bullet was used to kill Wilson. The houseboy (Joe Bautista) then reveals that right after the murder, he saw a woman wearing a \\"fuzzy coat and funny hat\\" hail a yellow cab with a dented fender. After purchasing his rug, Jim hears about the murder and hurries to the Wilson house to investigate. Meanwhile, Muggs, Glimpy and the other East Side Kids go to the taxi stand and learn from the driver (Bernard Gorcey) that he delivered a woman wearing a fuzzy coat to the Stephens apartment building, where Gypsy lives. As Muggs and the boys drive to the apartment building, the police arrive at the taxi stand, question the driver and dispatch a car to arrest Gypsy. When Muggs and the boys question Gypsy, she protests her innocence. Noticing the police car pull up to the curb, Muggs instructs Skinny (Billy Benedict) to don Gypsy's hat and coat and speed away in the newspaper's car. After the police follow Skinny, Muggs tells Gypsy to disguise herself as a boy and escorts her to the safety of the boys' clubhouse. Skinny drives to the Wilson house, watches as Diane leaves and follows her. At the clubhouse, Gypsy shows her gun to Muggs, who recognizes it as a .32 caliber, and Muggs pronounces that it is not the murder weapon. Jim, meanwhile, searches for clues at the Wilson house and finds a button in the hallway. Surmising that it belongs to the murderer, Jim takes the button to show his publisher, Lester Cartwright (Frank Jaquet). As Jim exhibits his clue, the police arrive to question Cartwright about the strange woman driving the Express's car. Upon seeing the button, the police take Cartwright in for questioning, and Cartwright, furious, fires Jim. Skinny, meanwhile, has followed Diane to the Pussy Cat Café, where she turns Gypsy's stolen securities over to Duncan. Skinny then telephones his sister and instructs her to find Muggs and send him to the café. Muggs has returned to the newspaper office and, learning of Jim's predicament, accompanies him to the clubhouse to interview Gypsy. When Skinny's sister, Jane (Anne Sterling) finds them outside the clubhouse and relates Skinny's message to Muggs, Muggs tells Jim to deliver Gypsy to police headquarters while he meets Skinny. Gypsy has left the clubhouse, however, and when Jim finds the room deserted, he dispatches the police to the café. Skinny is eavesdropping outside the door to Duncan's office when one of Duncan's henchmen finds him and imprisons him in a room. After Diane leaves the office to perform her act, Gypsy enters, pulls out her gun and demands that Duncan return the securities. Just then, Diane re-enters the room and begins to wrestle with Gypsy. As Skinny struggles with his captor in the next room, Muggs and the boys arrive and join the fray. Soon after, the police come to arrest Diane and Duncan, and Jim breaks the story about the capture of Wilson's murderers.

Overview  The djamaat is a centuries-old political unit, traditionally consisting of up to ten tribal or ancestral structures known as tuhums, which are broadly extended families. The government of a djamaat traditionally consisted of the elders from each of the tuhums. The djamaats were, in turn, governed by the adat (common law, prescriptions). The role of the djamaats in Dagestani history has been compared with that of the poleis in Ancient Greece. Although members of the djamaat often spoke the same language, ethnicity was not the primary connecting factor. The role of the djamaats faded after the new 1994 constitution of Dagestan, which provided other sources of authority in the republic, but the djamaats re-emerged when the national movement weakened. The Dagestani political life began to be dominated by \\"ethnoparties\\", whose key positions were often filled by djamaat members. The Dagestani djamaat, with its transcending kinship and ethnic structures, has been seen as a stabilizing factor in the political life of this ethnically and culturally diverse region.Ware, p.47-51  Footnotes   Sources  * History of Dagestan Politics of Dagestan ","title":"Djamaat"},{"id":"28963267","text":"The Siege of Pemaquid occurred during King William's War when French and Native forces from New France attacked the English settlement at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine), a community on the border with Acadia. The siege was led by Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Baron de St Castin between August 14–15, 1696. Commander of Fort William Henry, Captain Pasco Chubb, surrendered the fort. Iberville killed three of the soldiers and sent the other 92 back to Boston. The victory at Pemaquid was one of the most significant the French had during the war. The siege resulted in a retaliatory raid by New England forces on Acadia.  Historical context  During much of the seventeenth century, Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine) was the most northern coastal settlement of New England, and Pentagouet (present-day Castine, Maine) was the most southern Acadian settlement, a colony of New France. During King William's War, the area became a battleground as the French and English fought to determine the boundaries of their empires. In 1689 Baron de St Castin and the Wabanaki Confederacy (Abenaki) captured and burned down Fort Charles, the wooden stockade fort at Pemaquid. They killed 200 British at the fort and surrounding area. By 1692, the English regained control of the region, and Sir William Phipps ordered construction of Fort William Henry to replace Fort Charles (the original fort built in 1677 by order of Governor Andros). The English built Fort William Henry as a fortress to protect the northern boundary of New England. The fort was the largest in New England. The Massachusetts government used one third of its budget to build the fort. The fort was built with stone and mortar. There were eighteen cannon mounted in the gun ports of six-foot thick walls that rose ten to twenty feet above the ground. The fort was rebuilt under the direction of Captain John March with the assistance of Benjamin Church. The commander of the fort was Captain Pasco Chubb. He violated an assembly that was held under a flag of truce, by killing a number of the Abenaki chiefs who were present (including Chief Aspinquid). D'Iberville knew that he would require both a land-based cannon assault and war ships to conquer the fort. Led by Saint-Castin, the Abenaki Nation joined forces with D'Iberville at Pentagouet.  Siege  Baron de St Castin On August 14, D'Iberville led a force of 500 in the siege of Fort William Henry. Five hundred warriors descended onto Fort William Henry in their canoes. The warriors surrounded the fort, thereby pinning the English inside. This strategy allowed D'Iberville to enter the harbor and unload his cannons. D'Iberville arrived with three French ships. They immediately began to lay siege to the fort. Captain Chubb refused to surrender. The assault went on until the afternoon of the next day. In the terms of his surrender, Chubb arranged for his men to be escorted to Boston and exchanged for French and Indian prisoners held there.  Aftermath  D'Iberville and the natives continued on to the English colony of Newfoundland and raided many villages in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. Major Church retaliated for the siege by going to Acadia and engaging in the Raid on Chignecto. Chubb was tracked down by the natives two years later in his home in Andover and was massacred along with his family.

Early life Cammann was born on February 2, 1912 in New York City. He was the son of Herbert Schuyler Cammann (1884–1965) and Katharine Van Rensselaer Fairfax (1888–1978). His father, a great-grandson of Robert Fulton, inventor of the steamboat, was involved in real estate and insurance business he established in 1907. His sister, Katharine Schuyler Cammann, was married Howard S. Lipson of Sugar Hill, New Hampshire. His paternal grandparents were Hermann Henry Cammann (d. 1930), a former trustee of Columbia University and governor of New York Presbyterian Hospital, and Ella Crary Cammann. His maternal grandparents were Hamilton Rogers Fairfax, of the Fairfax family of Virginia, and Eleanor Cecilia (née Van Rensselaer) Fairfax of the Van Rensselaer family of New York. His grandmother was the granddaughter of Stephen Van Rensselaer III and Cornelia (née Paterson) Van Rensselaer. His maternal uncle was Hamilton Van Rensselaer Fairfax (1891–1955). Cammann attended St. Paul's School on Long Island and the Kent School in Kent, Connecticut, graduating in 1931.\\"Sill Society Recognizes Four New Inductees in 2010\\", Kent Quarterly, vol. XXXVI.3, Summer 2010, p. 39. Camman later graduated from Yale University with a BA in 1935, Harvard University with an MA in 1941, and from Johns Hopkins University with a Ph.D. in 1949, where he studied under Owen Lattimore. Career From 1935 to 1941 he taught English in the Yale-in-China program. During World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy, stationed in Washington D.C., and later in Western China and Inner Mongolia. In 1948, he joined the faculty of the Department of Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, which was founded by W. Norman Brown in 1931. He remained in the department until his retirement in 1982. From 1948 through 1955, he was the Associate Curator of the East Asian Collections for the University of Pennsylvania Museum. While at the museum, he was a member of excavation teams at Gordium (the capital city of ancient Phrygia in modern day Turkey) and Kunduz (a city in northern Afghanistan). From 1951 until 1955, he was also a panel member for the television show What in the World?. Cammann served as Vice-President of the American Oriental Society and was the editor of the Journal of the American Oriental Society. He also served as president of the Philadelphia Anthropological Society and Oriental Club of Philadelphia, and was a fellow of the American Learned Societies and the American Anthropological Association. =Legacy= Modern representation of the Lo Shu square as a magic square According to the History of Chinese Science and Culture Foundation, Cammann was: > \\"a man of independent means who had no academic ambitions or need for a > salary.

She was the daughter of Charles Addison Post, of Providence, Rhode Island, and Marcia de Forest Post of Hamilton, Bermuda, and granddaughter of Mrs. Isaac Judson Boothe of Providence. Together, they were the parents of five children: Francis Cammann, Stephen Van Rensselaer Cammann, Hamilton Cammann, Elizabeth Cammann, and William Cammann. On December 27, 1980, he married Mary Lyman Muir in Philadelphia. Mary was the widow of John Brinley Muir, a stockbroker, and the daughter of John Lyman Cox, an engineer and inventor.

This 1956 film was Bonita Granville's last film appearance. She retired from the screen to marry Jack Wrather. Plot Set in the American Southwest, the territorial governor enlists the help of the Lone Ranger to investigate mysterious raids on white settlers by Indians who ride with saddles. Wealthy rancher Reese Kilgore (Lyle Bettger) wants to expand his land to include Spirit Mountain, which is sacred to the local tribes. The Lone Ranger realizes the natives wanted to keep settlers away so they would not discover the rich silver deposits on Spirit Mountain, while Kilgore wants to encourage a war between settlers and natives so that he can mine the mountain himself. Working with Chief Red Hawk, the governor, Tonto, a cowboy named Ramirez, and a humorous disguise, the Lone Ranger discovers the true identities of the raiders, prevents war, protects the tribal lands, and rescues Kilgore's daughter from captivity.

Techniques  *Classical acting is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including Konstantin Stanislavski and Michel Saint-Denis. * In Stanislavski's system, also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the \\"truth\\" of the character they are portraying. The actor puts himself or herself in the mindset of the character finding things in common in order to give a more genuine portrayal of the character. * Method acting is a range of techniques used to assist acting persons in understanding, relating to and the portrayal of their character(s), as formulated by Lee Strasberg. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that in order to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner, but these are not considered \\"method acting\\". * Michael Chekhov developed an acting technique, a ‘psycho-physical approach’, in which transformation, working with impulse, imagination and inner and outer gesture are central. It offers clear and practical tools in working with imagination, feelings and atmosphere. This Creative Individuality allows the artist actor to use parts of themselves that are not just the smaller meaner more banal elements that make up their daily life, but rather parts of their unconscious, where dwell more universal and archetypal images. His acting technique has been used by actors such as Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood, Marilyn Monroe, and Yul Brynner. * Meisner technique requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. It is based on Stanislavski's system. * Practical Aesthetics is an acting technique originally conceived by David Mamet and William H. Macy, based on the teachings of Stanislavski, Sanford Meisner, and the Stoic philosopher Epictetus.Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher (October 23, 1997). \\"A Dramatist's How-To Guide for the Stage-Struck\\". The New York Times. Retrieved May 9, 2012. Some key features of the method include a particular method of script analysis, adaptability, and repetition exercises similar to those in Meisner technique. * In the Brechtian Method, Bertolt Brecht developed an \\"epic drama\\" style that relies on the audience's reflective detachment rather than emotional involvement.

The French king besieged Château Gaillard, a Norman fortress, for six months. The Anglo-Normans were beaten in the battle and the consequence was the fall of Normandy. Dispositions King Philip wished to take control of Normandy. The castle at Château Gaillard was the key to the campaign, but he did not move against it directly. Instead he attacked a number of lesser castles in the surrounding area, effectively isolating Château Gaillard and ensuring that his operations were not threatened by nearby forces. Having done as much as possible to prevent the relief of the castle, Philip then set about reducing it by siege. It would be a slow process, for Château Gaillard was a powerful fortress. The defenders were of course tied to their base, the castle. They could come out to make local counterattacks, but for the most part they had to simply remain within the defenses and try to counter the moves that Philip made. The Anglo-Normans took the precaution of destroying the bridge, making a river crossing difficult. Philip's forces first filled the ditch and broke through the palisade that defended it. This gave access to the castle proper, and it was necessary before any real operations could be undertaken. A bridge of boats, defended by ingenious floating towers mounted on boats, was set up to allow the French army to move back and forth. With his communications secure and access to the castle now gained, Philip began the work of reducing its defenses. Relief attempts The English sent two forces to relieve the castle. Under cover of darkness, one force was to row up the river and destroy the bridge of boats, which would cut the French forces in two. Meanwhile, a land force under William the Marshal was to attack one part of the French army which, with their backs to the river and unable to retreat, could be destroyed. The relief went awry. The land attack was completely successful at first, but the French were able to retreat over the bridge of boats, as the river assault had not arrived in time. In addition to troops and crews, the boats were heavily laden with supplies for the garrison, and took much longer than planned to row upstream against current and tide. The French were thus able to re-group and counter-attack, driving off the Anglo-Norman land forces. By the time the boats reached the bridge, the French were ready for them, and drove them off with considerable loss. John then abandoned his attempt to raise the siege. One contemporary chronicler states that he was twenty miles away before the rest of his army realised he'd gone. Preparations Even in the medieval period, the successful application of technology allowed a small force to achieve results out of proportion to the size of the unit. The tool in this case was Greek fire, a mixture of naphtha, pitch, and other ingredients that burst into flames when exposed to air. Strapping a number of clay canisters of flammable material to his body, a Frenchman named Galbert was able to swim to the island behind the castle and place his charges. The resulting inferno enabled the French to storm the island and complete the isolation of the castle. The siege was going to be a long one, so Philip had housing in the form of crude huts for his troops. He ordered that the trenches he dug to defend the camp and that a \\"covered way\\" be set up to allow his men to approach the castle without danger. Philip set up his siege engines in prepared positions. He ordered that the tops of the hills be leveled off to provide good emplacements for them. These threw heavy rocks at the Anglo- Normans. Meanwhile, Roger de Lacy was concerned that his supplies might not last until a new relief effort could be mounted. He therefore sent all non- combatants out of the castle. In some ways this might be a merciful gesture, but it was also good sense, in that it meant several hundred fewer people to feed. At first the French let the refugees through their siege lines, but after a time began to refuse them passage. The result was several hundred people ended up trapped between the besiegers and the castle as siege engines and archers exchanged fire over their heads. There they remained for some time, starving until Philip relented and gave them food. His men let them through the lines and they dispersed. King John of England made another attempt to break the siege, this time by raiding Brittany to draw off the French. But Philip declined to give up his hard work to chase the English around the countryside, and remained where he was. Disheartened, King John took a ship for England and did not return. Throughout the winter of 1203/1204, the defenders made do with what they had as Philip's men received more supplies. They built belfries, mobile structures designed to protect men while they used rams or other equipment to attack walls and gates. By February, the first assault was ready. The siege = The outer bailey falls = In order to get to the bailey, it was necessary to either breach the walls or open a gate. The latter was not likely, though it was possible to eventually batter through one. Philip's assault came from several directions. While siege engines and archers caused casualties on the walls, other engines and archers caused casualties among the defenders on the walls themselves, covered by belfries with a thick sloping roof to protect the men working inside. Miners worked to undermine the walls. There were many dangers, ranging from early collapse of the tunnel to counter-mining by the enemy, which would result in a desperate close-quarters battle for possession of the tunnels. Philip's assault on the outer bailey also included the most basic of castle assault techniques: escalade. Foot soldiers ran up to the walls with ladders, and began to climb them. Unfortunately, the ladders were too short. Men were under attack by the wall guards, unable to move due to the person behind them. Some of the attackers were able to create footholds in the stonework, and some of them gained the wall. There was bitter hand-to-hand fighting. More men came up the walls. As more Frenchmen gained the outer bailey, it became obvious it could not be held. Those of the defenders who could flee back to the inner bailey prepared themselves for a new assault. =The inner bailey falls= The cost in time and lives to gain the outer bailey had been high, but Philip was prepared for this. He decided to attack the last position; the second bailey. Philip's men climbed up a garderobe (toilet chute) and entered the chapel above. They then let their fellow soldiers into the central bailey, which was captured. The inner bailey was surrounded by a moat, crossed by a natural rock bridge. Using the bridge as cover, the French took the inner bailey. The forces of King John surrendered on March 6, 1204. Aftermath Having captured Château Gaillard, Philip launched a campaign into English-held territory. Plantagenet prestige and morale had suffered badly. Not only had they lost their fine castles, but their relief attempt had resulted in total defeat. Normandy did not put up much of a fight, and afterwards Philip took Rouen and pushed on all the way to the coast. His campaign gained him several principalities, including Anjou and Touraine. Plantagenet holdings in France were diminishing. Château Gaillard's commander, Roger de Lacy, returned to England to begin work reinforcing his own castle at Pontefract. In England, where King John was already unpopular, the fall of Château Gaillard meant the loss of even more prestige. A king who could not even keep control of his own castles, and who failed to come to the assistance of loyal lords holding out under siege in his name, was a weak king. It is likely that the humiliation of Château Gaillard played a part in the decision of English Barons to challenge King John. This in turn led to one of the most important events in English history: the signing of Magna Carta.Dougherty, Martin, 'Chateau Gaillard, 1203-4', in Battles of the Medieval World, 1000 - 1500 (2006), London, pp 60-69.

Plot \\"The Alamo\\" is a dive bar in Houston, Texas. On the eve of its demolition, the regular patrons gather to reminisce and discuss the future. In the opening scene, Ichabod (Steven Mattila), a cranky, young exterminator, arrives at the Alamo wanting to have a good time with his long-suffering girlfriend Mary to whom he is both physically and verbally abusive. Also arriving is Claude (Perryman), another blue-collared regular who is angry and distraught over being kicked out of his own house by his wife who is said to be unable to stand his crude lifestyle. Cowboy Regan (Davis) arrives after having not been seen for several days and, after reminiscing with his bar friends, tries a last-ditch effort to save the place by contacting his former college roommate who is now a powerful politician in the state capital of Austin. As the afternoon wears on into the evening and night, several of the patrons leave one by one to either go home or to another bar a few miles away called the B&B; which Cowboy loathes because it is regarded as a \\"Yankee bar\\" due to the upscale establishment and because the beer and other drinks are more expensive. Cowboy in the meantime commands the Alamo with his presence by telling anecdotes about his life which includes his recently quitting his job and wanting to go into the \\"movie business\\" as an actor. He partakes in a tequila drinking contest, gives Ichabod some money as he wants to take Mary to a nearby motel for the night, and even permits Claude to stay at his place for the night when Claude's attempts to reconcile with his estranged wife over the telephone fail. Late in the evening, when Cowboy's friend finally manages to call him back only to inform him that he could not do enough to save the Alamo from closing for good, Cowboy is mocked by a few of the patrons, mostly a former high-school bully named Steve. Cowboy gets more drunk and starts a barroom brawl with Steve which leads to the barman kicking them both out of the bar and closing it up a half-hour early. Outside the bar, as Cowboy sorrowfully compares the end of his hangout place to the end of the redneck way of life, Claude offers to drive him home and Cowboy agrees as they watch the neon lights of the Alamo shut down for good. Book ending the film is another appearance of Ichabod and Mary who arrive outside the now-closed Alamo bar arguing as they had been in the opening scene about both of them getting thrown out of the motel they were at due to Ichabod's drunken antics. The argument leads to Mary finally breaking up with Ichabod and driving away in his pickup truck with him angrily running after her on foot as a few of the Alamo patrons laugh and cheer him on. Production Pennell received a $25,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Southwest Alternate Media Project in Houston provided free office space and film equipment. Production began in May 1982 at an old bar, called the Old Barn, in East Houston and lasted for three and one- half weeks. The bar where the film was shot was still in business so daily shooting had to finish by 4 p.m. It is believed that Henkel finished the film as Pennell was having issues with alcohol and drugs and quit showing up.Alison Macor.

Placing notes in the Western Wall refers to the practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers to God into the cracks of the Western Wall, a Jewish holy site in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is claimed that occurrence of such a phenomenon dates from the early 18th century and stems from the Jewish tradition that the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall. There is however a dispute as to whether it is permissible according to Jewish law to insert slips of paper in to the crevices. Some argue that the practice debases the holiness of the Wall and that the placement of notes should be discontinued. History Notes wedged into the cracks of the Western Wall. The earliest account of placing prayer notes into the cracks and crevices of the Western Wall was recounted by Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira of Munkatch (d. 1937) and involved Rabbi Chaim ibn Attar (d. 1743) who instructed a destitute man to place an amulet between the stones of the Wall.Goldstein, M. (1931). Ma'asos Yerushalaim The rationale behind placing prayer notes in the Wall has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from the Western Wall,Exodus Rabbah 2:2. and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which the Western Wall abuts.Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer 35: \\"Anyone who prays in this place in Jerusalem, it is as if he prayed before the Throne of Glory, for the gate of heaven is there, open to hear all prayers\\". =Modern-day practice= A woman places a prayer note in the Wall. Today, more than a million prayer notes or wishes are placed in the Western Wall each year. Notes that are placed in the Wall are written in just about any language and format. Their lengths vary from a few words to very long requests. They include poems and Biblical verses. They are written on a wide variety of papers, including colored paper, notebook paper and even bubblegum wrappers, using a variety of inks. Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, Rabbi of the Western Wall, receives hundreds of letters yearly addressed to \\"God, Jerusalem\\"; he folds these letters and places them, too, in the Wall. Online services offer petitioners the opportunity to send their notes to the Western Wall via e-mail, fax, text messaging and Internet; the note is then printed out and inserted in the Wall. The Israeli Telephone Company has established such a fax service, as have a number of charitable websites. Disposal of notes According to Jewish law, prayer notes may not be thrown away; there is a difference of opinion as to whether they should be burned or buried. According to Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, Rabbi of the Western Wall and author of Minhagei HaKotel, a book of halakhot about the Western Wall, burning is a \\"pure\\" way to deal with the notes, but burying them is more honorable. Rabinovitch further states that the letters are buried because they have the status of letters to God.Eilen, Shia. \\"Interview with Harav Shmuel Rabinowitz, Rav of the Kosel\\". Hamodia Features, September 28, 2017, p. 10. Twice a year, Rabinovitch and his assistants collect the notes left in the Wall and bury them in the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. Notable persons who have placed notes in the Wall Then New York City Public Advocate, and now current Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio places a prayer note in the Western Wall, 2011 The tradition of leaving notes for God in the Western Wall has also been adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a message in the Western Wall include Pope John Paul II (in 2000), Pope Benedict XVI (in 2008) and Pope Benedict XVI, again in 2009, who released its contents to the media. U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton deposited a note in 2005. In July 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama placed a written prayer in the Wall. After Obama and his entourage departed, his note--written on hotel stationery--was removed from the Wall by a seminary student who sold it to the Maariv newspaper. The newspaper published the note, prompting criticism from other news sources and from the Rabbi of the Western Wall for violating the privacy that is inherent in notes placed in the Wall. In July 2012, U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney placed a written prayer in the Wall. His note was later moved to a different location in the Wall for privacy reasons and to avoid a repeat of the incident with Obama's note in 2008. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note. Trump's Vice President, Mike Pence, visited the Wall and deposited a prayer note on January 23, 2018, at the conclusion of his four-day visit to Israel.

Another incomplete bronze shield mount, sometimes called the Wandsworth Mask Shield was found at the same time. Both shield mounts are now held at the British Museum. The bold repoussé decoration on the Wandsworth Shield, comprising two birds with outstretched wings and long trailing tail feathers, has led Barry Cunliffe, Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford, to consider the shield to be \\"among the masterpieces of British Celtic art\\". Discovery The circular bronze shield mount, another incomplete bronze shield mount, a bronze sword, and celt were found in the River Thames at Wandsworth during dredging operations in 1849 or earlier, and were presented to the Royal Archaeological Institute by William English in December 1849. English was a millwright who operated steam dredging machines on the Thames from 1808 until about 1850. The two shield mounts were donated to the British Museum by the Royal Archaeological Institute in 1858. Description The Battersea Shield, showing a central boss that is similar to the Wandsworth Shield The circular shield mount (Proto-Celtic *skētos (compare Breton skoed “shield”; Latin scūtum) comprises a central shield boss and an outer flange, 33 cm in diameter, and may be the central boss of an oblong shield similar to the Battersea Shield. The boss is ornamented with a curvilinear decoration in La Tène style comprising two almost identical bird patterns. There is a depression in the centre of the boss that would have originally held an ornamental stud made of enamel, as is also the case with the Battersea Shield. The surrounding flange is decorated with stylised designs of two large birds, with outstretched palmette wings and long trailing tail feathers, each a mirror image of the other. Further bird shapes are incised with a rocked graver technique on the wings of the two birds. The eye of each bird is marked with a depression in which there is a rivet that would originally have held a stud, possibly of Mediterranean coral. The bronze part of the shield would have been mounted on a wooden backing by six rivets, of which only one survives. This rivet extends 8 mm in length, indicating that the wooden backing to the shield would have been no more than 8 mm thick. The incomplete bronze shield mount consists of a central boss, 11.85 cm in diameter, which transforms into a half-cylindrical spine at the top and bottom, one end broken and one end terminating in an anthropomorphic face. The surviving portion of the mount is 37.0 cm in length, and is similar to the boss and medial spine on the Witham Shield. The central boss is ornamented with repoussé work combined with a finely engraved spiral decoration, showing the heads of two ducks. The terminal face has three hairspring spirals engraved on the nose, and a row of triangles representing the teeth of the mouth. The surviving bronze mount would have been mounted on an oblong wooden shield with at least seven rivets. The length of the rivets indicates that the wooden backing would have been no more than 8 mm thick. The circular shield mount is dated to the 2nd century BC, and the mask shield is dated to the later 3rd century BC. It has been conjectured that these two shields, as well as other Iron Age shields that have been found in rivers, such as the Battersea Shield and the Witham Shield, were votive offerings to the gods. Together with the Witham Shield, the style, especially of the engraving, is very close to that of the Torrs Pony-cap and Horns found in Scotland and now in the Museum of Scotland.

On January 3, 1898 Commodore George Dewey took command of the fleet in anticipation of a pending war with Spain. The fleet waited in Hong Kong through the winter and on April 25, 1898 word was received that the United States declared war with Spain. With this news the fleet moved to Mirs Bay, China. On the morning of May 1, 1898 Commodore Dewey gave the order to enter Manila Bay and confront the Spanish flotilla commanded by Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo. At approximately 05:40, Dewey ordered Olympias captain to open fire on the Spanish ships and the coastal batteries. Teytand and the other sailors aboard Olympia fired the first shots of the engagement and continued to engage the Spanish ships until the majority of Pasarón's flotilla of ships had been destroyed and then city of Manila surrendered to Dewey and the American forces. After the defeat of the Spanish forces and the surrender of Manila Olympia, Teytand, and the other members of the crew remained in the area and supported the United States Army by shelling Spanish forces on land. On May 20, 1899, after completing their mission in the Philippines, Olympia and her crew along with Teytand returned to the Chinese coast.

Hjalti was known by the nickname \\"The Great Ursus\\". He first began in strength sports by competing as a junior powerlifter representing Iceland in 1983. Hjalti coached the great Jón Páll Sigmarsson and competed alongside Magnús Ver Magnússon in a team strength competition called Pure Strength in 1989 & 1990. Biography Hjalti Árnason was born in Reykjavík in 1963David Webster, Sons of Samson - Volume 2, pages 71-2, (Ironmind Enterprises Inc: Nevada City), He grew up in the same neighbourhood as Jón Páll Sigmarsson and they were at the same school, although Jón Páll was three years older. His sports career began with training in karate and he participated in many others such as soccer, handball, and track and field. He had a talent for Powerlifting and shot to fame when he began competing internationally from 1983. In that year he came first in the Junior European Championships and made the senior national team. Quickly though he began to compete in strongman events to make a living as a semi-professional. He found at an early stage that powerlifting had little money or publicity associated with it and also his fellow Icelander and school friend, Jón Páll Sigmarsson, was beginning to make waves in the higher profile world of the World's Strongest Man and its associated circuit. His forays into strength athletics consisted of a mixture of Highland Games and strongman events. It was noted that he relied on his \\"tremendous strength\\" but sacrificed technique and suffered from a lack of proper, regular coaching. In 1985, Hjalti competed in the very first Iceland's Strongest Man contest.Wednesday, June 17, 2009, Stefán Sölvi Pétursson Wins Iceland's Strongest Man by Randall J. Strossen, Ph.D., IronMind Hjalti Árnason was second to Jón Páll that year whilst Magnús Ver Magnússon came third. Hjalti would repeat podium finishes in this contest on more than one occasion whilst in the company of two men who between them won the World's Strongest Man title eight times. In one such contest his \\"animalistic approach\\" was demonstrated when he broke his opponents arm in an arm wrestling bout. Upon being asked to do \\"something spectacular for the TV cameras\\" by a sponsor he was reported to have picked the sponsor up by an arm and a leg and hurled him some distance to the astonishment of bystanders. On the world stage he was a top performer in Highland Games. His wrestling match with Bill Kazmaier at Earlshall has been described as one of the best ever. He was highly rated at the World Muscle Power Championships and in breaking the world record in the platform lift became the first European to win the prestigious Le Defi Mark Ten International in Canada. However, his only appearance as a contestant at the World's Strongest Man was in 1996 at the end of his career and he failed to qualify for the finals. Prior to that he had been to many events as a tester, alongside his great friend Mark Higgins. Prior to 1994 the WSM had a limited field with no heats. As such countries were rarely granted multiple competitor places. For Hjalti, when in the prime of his strength sporting career this left him in the shadow of Jón Páll, and later the rise of Magnús Ver Magnússon. This has been described by David Webster as a pity because \\"he was undoubtedly one of the world's strongest men.\\" Hjalti continued to compete as a powerlifter and won the +125 kg super heavyweight class of the IPF World Powerlifting Championships in 1991 in Örebro, Sweden. Hjalti was later disqualified and the title passed to Hans Zerhoch.Hjalti was the first Icelander to break the 1000 kg barrier in the total (squat, bench press & deadlift).http://strongestman.billhenderson.org/int/int4.html Personal life and career after sport From his marriage to Margét, Hjalti has two sons, Greipur (born 1989) and Árni (born 1992). After divorcing, he moved in with his girlfriend, Halla Heimisdóttir. His careers were multiple and varied. He was a bouncer, caring supervisor in a psychiatric hospital, security agent and debt collector. He also became a system administrator for Post and Telecom in Iceland. He also remained close to sport and became a promoter of strength athletics in Iceland. His latest venture was the promotion of Iceland's Strongest Man. His brother is a noted musician in Iceland.

She was born in Shanghai and graduated from Shanghai National Conservatory of Music in 1948 with a degree in composition. She had a full, eventful career that spanned several eras of important Chinese history. She worked with the Central Philharmonic Society and held several leadership positions on the board of the Chinese Musicians' Association. Her choral works were performed in 1997, 1999 and 2000 in Beijing and Shanghai.  Early Life & Education  Xixian was born to parents Qu Baowen and Zhu Pingyu on September 23, 1919 in Shanghai. She loved music from a very young age, and began her formal music education during her childhood. In 1939, Xixian studied with German-Jewish composer, Wolfgang Fraenkel while he was living in Shanghai. Fraenkel had a profound influence on Xixian, as well as other prominent Chinese composers such as Ding Shande and Sang Tong. From 1940 to 1948, Xixian studied piano and composition at the Shanghai National Conservatory. Among her many teachers was Tan Xiaolin, a former pupil of Paul Hindemith, before his return to the United States in 1944. Shortly after graduating from the composition department of the Shanghai National Conservatory in 1948, Xixian began to teach harmony and music history at the Beijing Art Institute, now called Beijing Opera Arts College.  Composition career  In 1949 Xixian began to compose professionally. She wrote original scores for the Central Song and Dance Ensemble (which became the Central National Music Ensemble) from 1949 to 1954. Consequently, she composed for the Central Philharmonic Society (1954-unknown). A large portion of Xixian’s compositions are vocal pieces. She was particularly interested in choral writing and her unconventional use of diverse vocal timbres resulted in unique and innovative work. She became musically renowned for her beloved choral arrangements of Chinese folk songs. For example, her most famous piece “Pastoral” is a four-part vocal work based on the Dongmeng folk song “Throwing Sticks.” In this piece, Xixian employs Western tonality and harmonically- driven melodies in conjunction with polyphonic interweaving. Works = Choral Works = * Pastoral (1954) * Listening to Mother Talking of the Past (1957) - First Prize in 1980 Children’s Song Contest * Cantata of the Red Army Base (1958) * The Rickshaw Boy (1982) * Call Me By My Pet Name (1985) * We and You (1987) - First Prize Children’s Song Contest * The Flying Petals (1988) - First Prize Teacher’s Song Contest * Releasing Pigeons at the Great Wall (1992) - First Prize Children’s Song Contest = Film Scores = * Song of Youth (1959) * Music of the Red Flag (1960) * Xiangzi the Camel (1981)  Leadership Positions  Throughout her life, Xixian was involved as a composer and administrator for several elite music societies and organizations. In 1979 she was elected as the Director of the Chinese Musicians' Association. A few years later, in 1985, she became the Vice President.  Political Involvement  A great deal of Xixian’s compositional work reflects various historical periods she lived through in China, such as New China, the Cultural Revolution and the Reform Era. Along with several other Chinese artists in the 1950s, Xixian used composition to participate in protesting their government’s plan to control social messages in music. Many songs that were written by this generation of Chinese musicians are still sung in the 21st Century. Xixian’s song in particular was quite positive and celebratory, entitled “Quan Shijie Renmin Xin Yi Tiao” which translates to “All The World’s People Are of the Same Mind.” Many of her compositions were inspired by folkloric stories or by what she observed of the world around her. Particularly, a few of her songs reflected the challenges and struggles faced by the Chinese lower class. For example, The Rickshaw Boy was inspired by the novel Rickshaw Boy written by Lao She, detailing the life of an impoverished boy who supports himself by towing a rickshaw.  Personal life  Beyond her musical career, Xixian’s interest in socio-political developed throughout her entire life. At the age of 18, Xixian left Shanghai and travelled to Hunan to participate in anti- Japanese rioting that occurred there in 1937. Toward the end of her life, Xixian greatly suffered from lung cancer. She believed that China should pass a “Right to Die” law, stating that “A good death is better than living with pain.\\" On March 19, 2008, she passed away from lung cancer at the age of 89. While she was alive, her interests included reading and socializing with her friends.

The festival is dedicated to bring classic pop music to the public. Although the festival has over the years featured several major label acts, such as Phantom Planet, Maroon 5 (under their previous incarnation, Kara's Flowers), and The Click Five, Bash tries to maintain the grassroots feel of the festival by featuring primarily unsigned bands, and presenting them in a festival platform with similar minded artists, where they will be appreciated by both the festival audiences and by each other. Bash personally selects all the artists. Each year, Bash produces a CD compilation on the Omnivore label featuring bands that have played in any of the cities in which the festival has appeared.  Early life and formative years  Bash was born in Poughkeepsie, New York, on September 2, 1958, and grew up listening to 1970s top 40 radio on stations like WABC AM and 99X FM. He made the transition to album oriented radio in 1975, with stations like WPLJ FM and WNEW FM. By the time of his graduation from New York University in 1981, with a BA in journalism, Bash had amassed a collection of 4000 LPs and 1000 45s. The following year, he returned to college at the University of California Irvine; in 1984, he received a BA in psychology. He remained at UCI for graduate school, entering a PhD program in cognitive psychology, but in 1990 decided to leave with his master's degree, and embark on a teaching career. From 1990 through 1998, Bash taught psychology at various community colleges, including Cerritos College, Cuyamaca College, Palomar College and Camp Pendelton.  Pop music journalism and the International Pop Overthrow Festival  Throughout this time, Bash maintained his strong interest in music. By the early 1990s his record and CD collection had grown to almost 8000 items, and included many obscurities from international artists not generally known in the US. By the mid-1990s, Bash had discovered pop music fanzines, such as Yellow Pills and Audities, and started writing music reviews and articles for both publications in 1995. Over the next few years, he also wrote for Discoveries, Goldmine, Amplifier, and PopSided magazines, and penned the liner notes for various re-issue CDs, such as The Toms (on Not Lame Recordings), Wanna Meet the Scruffs??, Nino Tempo & April Stevens All Strung Out (Varèse Sarabande), and the 3 disc set Magic Time: The Millennium/Ballroom Recordings (Sundazed). From his writing of CD reviews, Bash got to know unsigned bands from all over the world. Many of these bands expressed a strong desire to play in Bash's home town of Los Angeles, so in December 1997, Bash decided to create the International Pop Overthrow Music Festival. The name was chosen to pay tribute to Jim Ellison, singer songwriter of Material Issue, a powerpop band from Chicago, whose 1991 debut album was entitled International Pop Overthrow. The name was also chosen to communicate Bash's desire to overthrow, with the kind of classic pop music being featured at the festival, what had become decidedly \\"unpop\\" mainstream radio sounds. In August 1998, the first International Pop Overthrow festival was held in Los Angeles, featuring 120 pop and rock bands from Los Angeles, several other US cities, and 10 bands from five countries: Canada, Australia, Sweden, France, and the Netherlands. Over the next three years, its roster grew to include bands from countries such as Japan, Norway, Austria, Israel, and the United Kingdom. At the 2001 festival, during a panel discussion, it was suggested by several bands that Bash take International Pop Overthrow on the road. The first city outside Los Angeles in which the International Pop Overthrow Festival (IPO) was held was New York, in December 2001, followed by Chicago in April 2002. Each new city that followed added a cache of strong local talent, and provided opportunities for bands from other cities in which IPO was already established to play. The festival became international in 2003, when Bash was approached by Beatles historian, Jean Catharell, to hold the festival in Liverpool, UK. The festival has since become a yearly event at the Cavern Club, drawing unsigned pop and rock talent from around the world. The festival is now held annually in 16 different cities, and Bash continues to explore opportunities to take the festival to additional locales, with Spain, Japan, and Australia high on the list of possible future International Pop Overthrow locations. The International Pop Overthrow Festival has been held in several venues, such as the Cavern Club (Liverpool UK), the Troubadour (Los Angeles), the El Rey (Los Angeles), Spaceland (Los Angeles), the Abbey (Chicago), Schubas (Chicago), Bottom of the Hill (San Francisco), The Rivoli (Toronto), the Khyber (Philadelphia), Arlene's Grocery (New York), Kenny's Castaways (New York), the Knitting Factory (Los Angeles and New York), the Middle East (Boston), the Railway (Vancouver BC), City Hall (Denver), and the Orange County Fair (Orange County CA). The International Pop Overthrow festival has been recognized in an interactive exhibit at The Grammy Museum, as helping the power pop genre \\"persist into the new millenium.\\" Artists who have played the International Pop Overthrow Festival include Walter Egan, Harmony Grass, Shoes, Off Broadway, John Wicks & The Records, The Rubinoos, The Cowsills, and Enuff Z'Nuff, as well as recent and current stars, such as Kara's Flowers (now known as Maroon 5), Phantom Planet, The Click Five, Jason Falkner, Seth Swirsky and The 88. The International Pop Overthrow Festival has been covered in numerous publications, including The Los Angeles Times, L.A. Weekly, The Chicago Sun Times, The Boston Herald, The Boston Globe, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, The Liverpool Echo, BBC Liverpool, SPIN!, Goldmine, Amplifier, and Billboard. In addition, Bash has been featured in a Sonicbids promoter profile, and noted Liverpool historian and BBC radio personality, Spencer Leigh, devoted several pages to the festival in his book, The Cavern: The Most Famous Club in the World.  Personal  After having lived in Sherman Oaks, California for 19 years, Bash moved to Reseda, CA in February, 2019. In 2001, he met his future wife, Rina Bardfield, at an International Pop Overthrow show, and they have been together ever since. Bardfield helps with the selection and scheduling of artists for the festival, and writes many of the artist descriptions for the festival's various programs and website. Bash writes music reviews and the occasional article for Shindig! magazine, Ugly Things magazine, and , and writes a column called Bash On Pop on the International Pop Overthrow website. Bash has recently been named one of the Executive Producers of The Power Pop Movie, which is written and directed by Justin Fielding.

He was instrumental in Tang's eventual defeat of the agrarian rebel Huang Chao, but at times had an adversarial relationship with the court of Emperor Xizong and the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi.  Background  It is not known when Wang Chongrong was born, and the official histories differ as to where his family was from—according to the Old Book of Tang, Hezhong Municipality (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi),Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. and according to the New Book of Tang, Taiyuan Municipality.New Book of Tang, vol. 187. His father Wang Zong (王縱) was a successful military officer who reached the position of prefect of Yan Prefecture (鹽州, in modern Yulin, Shaanxi). Because of his father's contributions, both Wang Chongrong and his older brother Wang Chongying served in the military as well, and both were known for their fierce fighting ability. Wang Chongrong had at least one other older brother, Wang Chongjian (王重簡).  Rise to power and campaign against Huang Chao  In 880, Wang Chongrong, who was then serving as a commander of the infantry at Hezhong Circuit, came to control Hezhong Circuit—but how he did so was disputed among the main traditional historical sources. According to the Old Book of Tang, when the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an, establishing his own state of Qi as its emperor and forcing the then-reigning Tang Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu, the military governor of Hezhong, Li Du (李都), believing that he could not resist Huang, submitted to Huang, and was allowed to remain at Hezhong, while Wang was commissioned deputy military governor by Huang. Wang, however, objected to the numerous demands for material supplies from Huang, and forced Li Du to yield power to him; Wang then claimed the position of acting military governor, killed the Qi emissaries, and sent Li Du on his way to Chengdu to pay homage to Emperor Xizong. The New Book of Tang gave a largely similar account, but further indicated that Emperor Xizong then sent the official Dou Jue (竇潏) to replace Li Du, and Wang forced Dou to return to Emperor Xizong and seized control of the circuit. The Zizhi Tongjian indicated that Wang had started a disturbance before Huang captured Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to recall Li Du and commission him as acting military governor; that Wang subsequently submitted to Huang but then relented when faced with numerous material demands from Huang and returned to the Tang fold.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. In any case, after Wang finally turned against Huang, Huang sent his general Zhu Wen and his brother Huang Ye (黃鄴) to attack Hezhong. Wang defeated them, and then entered into an alliance with Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), who had approached the region intending to attack Huang Chao. They both advanced to the region north of the Wei River, preparing for an operation to recapture Chang'an for Tang. The joint Tang forces, which also included forces commanded by Zheng Tian, Tang Hongfu (唐弘夫), and Tuoba Sigong, briefly recaptured Chang'an in summer 881, but after the soldiers got bogged down inside the city pillaging the people, Qi forces counterattacked, dealing Tang forces serious defeats and recapturing Chang'an. Meanwhile, during the campaign, Emperor Xizong commissioned Wang Chongrong military governor of Hezhong. Thereafter, he, joined by Gao Xun (高潯) the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), captured Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) for Tang. In spring 882, Zhu captured Tong Prefecture (同州, in modern Weinan) and then attacked Hezhong, but Wang Chongrong was able to repel him. Unable to defeat Wang Chongrong, Zhu repeatedly sought reinforcements from Huang, but Huang's assistant Meng Kai (孟楷) repeatedly suppressed his reports and did not report them to Huang. In fall 882, believing that Qi would eventually fall, Zhu submitted to Wang Chongrong and, as Zhu's mother was named Wang as well, he honored Wang as a maternal uncle. Under Wang's recommendation, the former Tang chancellor Wang Duo, who was then in charge of the overall operations against Huang, commissioned Zhu as the military governor of Tonghua Circuit (同華, headquartered at Tong Prefecture) and gave him a new name of Quanzhong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. However, at that time, the Tang forces were stuck in a stalemate with Huang, and they continued to fear his military strength. After Wang Chongrong consulted with the eunuch general Yang Fuguang, Wang Duo, and Wang Hui), Yang suggested pardoning the Shatuo rebel general Li Keyong and requesting that Li Keyong join the battle. After Wang Duo sent an order to Li Keyong summoning him, Li Keyong agreed, and soon arrived in the region to join the campaign. Meanwhile, late in 882, Emperor Xizong bestowed on Wang Chongrong the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). In 883, Li Keyong and Wang Chongrong joined their forces and advanced toward Chang'an, repeatedly defeating Qi forces. Li Keyong soon entered Chang'an, forcing Huang to flee east. For Wang Chongrong's contributions during the campaign, he was given the title of acting Taiwei (太尉, one of the Three Excellencies) and created the Prince of Langye.  Confrontation with Tian Lingzi  After Emperor Xizong returned to Chang'an in 885, however, a dispute between Wang Chongrong and the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi, who controlled Emperor Xizong's court, broke out. The imperial treasury had become very drained after Emperor Xizong's return to Chang'an, as most military governors throughout the empire were by that point withholding revenues that their circuits had previously submitted to the imperial government. Wang Chongrong himself had previously seized control of two salt ponds in Hezhong Circuit, which had previously under the imperial director of salt and iron monopolies, submitting only a small amount of the salt to the imperial government. Tian Lingzi requested that Emperor Xizong restore the control of the ponds to the control by the director of the salt and iron monopolies, and further put himself in charge of the two ponds. Wang objected and submitted repeated petitions requesting that he be allowed to continue to control the two ponds, to no avail. Further, when Tian's adopted son Tian Kuangyou (田匡祐) served as an emissary to Hezhong, Wang initially welcomed him warmly, but Tian Kuangyou offended the Hezhong soldiers with his arrogance. Wang then turned against him, arrested him, and declared Tian Lingzi's crimes in his presence. The eunuch monitor of Hezhong pleaded for Tian Kuangyou, and Wang released him. When Tian Kuangyou returned to Chang'an, he suggested that Tian Lingzi take action against Wang. In summer 885, Tian Lingzi thus had Emperor Xizong issue an edict transferring Wang Chongrong to Taining Circuit (泰寧, in modern Jining, Shandong), Qi Kerang the military governor of Taining to Yiwu Circuit, and Wang Chucun from Yiwu to Hezhong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Wang Chongrong refused to follow the order and submitted an accusation against Tian Lingzi. Wang Chucun also submitted a petition on his behalf, and, when the order was not rescinded, made only a token attempt to head to Hezhong before returning to Yiwu. Tian aligned with Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), while Wang Chongrong sought aid from Li Keyong. Around the new year 886, the armies engaged in battle, and Wang Chongrong's and Li Keyong's forces defeated those of Tian and his allies. Li Keyong approached Chang'an, and Tian took Emperor Xizong and fled to Xingyuan (興元, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Li Keyong and Wang Chongrong withdrew their forces to Hezhong and submitted petitions demanding Tian's death. When Emperor Xizong subsequently ordered Wang Chongrong to supply the imperial army with food, Wang responded that he would refuse the order unless Tian were executed. Meanwhile, Zhu took the opportunity to turn against Emperor Xizong, declaring Emperor Xizong's distant relative Li Yun the Prince of Xiang the new emperor at Chang'an.  Reconciliation with Emperor Xizong  Meanwhile, by this point, Tian Lingzi, knowing that the entire empire hated him, had resigned and gone to Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu), where his brother Chen Jingxuan was military governor. Tian was succeeded as the commander of the imperial Shence Armies (神策軍) by Yang Fuguang's brother Yang Fugong. At the suggestion of the chancellor Du Rangneng, who pointed out that Wang Chongrong and Yang Fuguang (who had died by that point) were friendly to each other, Emperor Xizong had Yang Fugong write Wang Chongrong to persuade him to return to allegiance to Emperor Xizong. Upon receiving Yang Fugong's letter, Wang redeclared his loyalty to Emperor Xizong, submitted a tribute of silk, and further offered to attack Zhu Mei for Emperor Xizong. Li Keyong also redeclared his loyalty to Emperor Xizong as well. Around the new year 887, Zhu's officer Wang Xingyu, who had been sent by Zhu to try to capture Emperor Xizong but who had been able to make no headway toward Xingyuan, was fearful of Zhu's punishment and was enticed by Yang Fugong's declaration that whoever killed Zhu would be given Jingnan Circuit. He returned to Chang'an and killed Zhu in a surprise attack. Li Yun's chancellors Pei Che and Zheng Changtu, along with some 200 imperial officials, took Li Yun and fled to Hezhong. Wang Chongrong initially pretended to welcome them, and then arrested and executed Li Yun and imprisoned Pei and Zheng (who were later also executed at Emperor Xizong's order). He sent Li Yun's head to Emperor Xizong at Xingyuan. Emperor Xizong then returned to Chang'an.  Death  It was said, however, that late in his career, Wang Chongrong, whose rule of Hezhong was harsh, grew even harsher. He had once punished the officer Chang Xingru (常行儒), and Chang felt ashamed and decided to turn against him. In summer 887, Chang started a mutiny at night and attacked the headquarters. Wang Chongrong fled to his vacation home outside the city, but Chang tracked him down there and killed him. Chang supported Wang Chongrong's brother Wang Chongying, who was then the military governor of nearby Shan'guo Circuit (陝虢, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) to replace Wang Chongrong, and Emperor Xizong issued an edict transferring Wang Chongying to Hezhong, while leaving Wang Chongying's son Wang Gong in charge at Shan'guo as acting military governor. After Wang Chongying took control of Hezhong, he put Chang to death. Wang Chongrong's adoptive son Wang Ke (son of Wang Chongrong's brother Wang Chongjian, so biological nephew) would eventually succeed Wang Chongying after Wang Chongying's death in 895, but Hezhong would eventually be conquered by Zhu Quanzhong in 901.

The term was coined in 1966 by Dietz and Holden from the miogeosyncline concept of the outdated geosynclinal theory.

Both slaves and slaveowners used the traditional biblical story to not only form their respective identities but also to define their purpose in America. The motif of the Exodus was first used in American history in 1630 by John Winthrop, aboard the Arabella in his famous sermon \\"A Modell for Christian Charity\\". In this sermon Winthrop introduced the idea that the Puritans, had inherited the divine covenant first given to the Hebrews, making them New Israel. In this conception, the crossing of the Atlantic was equated to the Exodus. From this moment on, early Americans would adopt this narrative as their founding myth. During the 19th century, slaveowners also used this narrative to explain their situation and give them a purpose. The slaveowners set themselves up as New Israel, the \\"Redeemer Nation\\".Albert J. Raboteau. A Fire in the Bones: Reflections on African-American Religious History (Boston: Beacon Press, 1995), 31. In this understanding, slaveowners were \\"to reach the pinnacle of perfection and to carry liberty and the gospel around the globe.\\" As with slaveowners, slaves also used the Exodus narrative to frame their situation. Although in their version however, slaveowners were cast in the role of Pharaoh, instead of New Israel, and the slaves corresponded to the Israelites.Judith W. Kay. “The Exodus and Racism: Paradoxes for Jewish Liberation”, Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall/Winter 2008):5 The Exodus narrative not only became an instrument of hope for the enslaved, but also allowed them to make sense of their situation and provided a blueprint for their deliverance. This can be most best seen in their spirituals, such as \\"Go Down Moses\\" and \\"Deep River\\". By appropriating the narrative of Exodus the slaves did more than simply try to understand their situation and their past; they created for themselves a national identity and, equally importantly, a mythic past.Albert J.

Unlike most Shinto shrines, which are unpainted, those dedicated to the fox deity Inari, the god of the harvest, are painted bright red. This shrine thus represents not just the religious heritage of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii, but also their principal early roles as agricultural laborers on sugarcane and pineapple plantations. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 8 January 1980. The simple wood frame building measures 19 by 26 feet, with wooden steps leading up to a raised floor with a balustraded verandah that wraps around the sanctuary. Long eaves of the irimoya (hip-and- gable) roof extend over both the front steps and the verandah. The sanctuary is enclosed by sliding doors with latticework tops and contains an inner altar behind a bell rope and a box for offerings. The building has been carefully restored but still lacks the chigi (forked finials) above the ornamental ridgepole. The shrine was founded by Reverend Yoshio Akizaki, a Shinto priest who had studied in Tokyo in 1912. Originally built in 1914 in Honolulu's industrial area of Kakaako by a Japanese architect known only as Haschun, it was relocated in 1918 to 2132 South King Street in Moiliili, the heart of the city's Japanese community. After the death of the founder in 1951, his son Takeo inherited both the property and the priesthood. After Takeo's death, the property was sold and the shrine was relocated to Waipahu Cultural Garden in 1979 to make way for a sporting goods store. The relocated shrine is in a rural rather than urban setting and the surrounding garden lacks several of its original elements, including its water purification basin (chōzuya or temizuya), its paired stone images of guardian lions and fox deities, and its original torii, although a new torii has been reconstructed at the new site. For its 100th anniversary in 2014, it received a new roof and won a Historic Preservation Honor Award.

Panels are used in contrast to single-judge appeals, and hearings, which involves all of the judges of that court. Most national supreme courts sit as panels.  United States  In the United States, most federal appellate cases are heard by three-judge panels. The governing statute, 28 U.S.C. § 46(c), provides: > Cases and controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or panel of > not more than three judges (except that the United States Court of Appeals > for the Federal Circuit may sit in panels of more than three judges if its > rules so provide), unless a hearing or rehearing before the court is ordered > by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regular active > service. This practice has been in place since as early as 1891.Marin K. Levy and Adam S. Chilton, \\"Challenging the Randomness of Panel Assignment in the Federal Courts of Appeals\\", 101 Cornell L. Rev. 1 (2015). Most trials in the United States District Courts are held before a single judge, but there are some circumstances where the trial itself is required to be held before a three judge panel. For example, 28 U. S. C. § 2284(a) states: > A district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required > by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the > constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the > apportionment of any statewide legislative body. Until 1976, three-judge panels heard lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state and federal statutes, but this practice has largely ended, the major exceptions being apportionment and redistricting cases.\\"In the early 1900s Congress began requiring such panels for all lawsuits contesting the constitutionality of state statutes. In 1937 the panels were extended to cases challenging the constitutionality of federal laws. . . . In 1976, however, Congress repealed those three-judge panel laws, finding the procedure too cumbersome and inefficient.\\" Typically, if the chief judge is a member of the panel, that person will chair the panel and call hearings to order; if the chief judge is not on the panel, this duty falls to the senior- most judge. Following oral arguments, the judges will meet briefly to confer and determine what the likely majority opinion in the case will be. If the judge who chairs the panel is in the majority at this time, that judge may assign the writing of the opinion for that case. Panel selection Selection of judicial panels is supposed to be random, or otherwise carried out in a way that avoids an appearance that the selection of the panel is intended to influence the outcome of a case. In the United States federal courts, the office of the courts states that \\"creation and scheduling of panels, and the assignment of specific cases to those panels, is handled by either the clerk of court's office or the circuit executive's office\\", with judges having \\"no role in panel assignments\\". In some cases, however, challenges have been raised against the randomness or neutrality of the selection process. In 1963, for example, judge Benjamin Franklin Cameron of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \\"threw [the court] into turmoil, charging Chief Judge Elbert P. Tuttle with manipulating the composition of panels in civil rights and desegregation cases so as to influence their outcome\\".Jonathan L. Entin, \\"'The Sign of The Four': Judicial Assignment and the Rule of Law\\", Faculty Publications (1998), p. 377. Although on the surface it appears that certain judges appeared on the panels an unusual number of times, a deeper examination noted that some of these appearances were dictated by the preference of certain judges (including Cameron) not to sit with others, thus reducing the number of possible combinations, and counting multiple hearings of the same case as separate panels. A 2015 study suggested that \\"several of the circuit courts have panels that are nonrandom in ways that impact the ideological balance of panels\\".

Built in 1907, it features a distinctive design that eliminates support posts in its dining hall and auditorium. Now owned by a local artists' cooperative, it continues to function as a social and civic meeting space. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The former Machias Grange hall is set on the south side of the Machias River, opposite the town's downtown area, at the junction of Obrien and Elm Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and concrete foundation. Its main entrance is set at the eastern end of the long side facing Elm Street, under a hip-roofed portico supported by turned posts. The facade facing Obrien Street is distinguished by a deeply overhanging second story, with the overhang supported by large Queen Anne-inspired brackets. There are two pairs of sash windows on each of the main floors on this facade, and a single sash window at the attic level. The main entrance opens into a foyer area that extends along the east side of the building, with stairs leading to the auditorium upstairs, and doors leading to the dining area that occupies most of the downstairs. The kitchen occupies the northeastern corner. The upstairs auditorium has a simple raised platform stage (with no backstage area) at the far end. The dining room ceiling is supported by a combination of heavy wooden timbers, with metal rods oriented laterally to them, eliminating the need for supporting pillars. A similar support system is also used in the ceiling of the auditorium, but it is obscured by a suspended tin ceiling. The Machias Grange was organized in 1903, and met in the town's Pennell Block until it built this structure in 1907. Records of the period have not survived, so the building's architect is not known. Because of the building's sizable dining room and kitchen, it quickly became an important local venue for social and fraternal events, dances, and religious services. When the town's last movie theater closed, the Grange also screened films here. With the Grange's membership in decline, the building was sold in 2001 to the Beehive Cooperative, an artists' cooperative, which has restored the building and continues to offer it as a social and community meeting space.

Work on the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore The façade of the Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence The original facade design for Santa Maria del Fiore, by Giotto, was found outdated for the cathedral and so a series of three competitions was held to modify Giotto's original design, keeping with the main lines of the structure. The challenge for the competition was to create a facade which brought together two periods in architecture: the Gothic style, which had faded out, and the Renaissance style, which was more recent.

The interior begins with a small vestibule, with a coat room on the left and stairs to the right. A door leads into a large dining room, with bathrooms to the rear and a kitchen behind the coat room. The second floor houses the lodge hall of the Grange, with the stage at the east end of the hall. Monticello's Grange chapter (the Patrons of Husbandry) was founded in 1899, and its first meeting hall was built that year. That building was destroyed by fire in 1921, and this building was built to replace it the following year. For many years the hall housed a variety of functions, including town offices and town meetings as well as a wide variety of social functions. Because the community's school had no large meeting space until 1974, graduations and school events were held here. Town offices were moved to an adjacent building in 1980.

The first highlight for the team was participating in the 1998 World's Strongest Tag Determination League but they ended up finishing in last place with 2 points by only beating Albright and Giant Kimala. A few months later they teamed with Hiroshi Hase in a one night six-man tag team tournament where they made it to the semi-finals before losing to Mitsuharu Misawa, Yoshinari Ogawa, and Masahito Kakihara. After Albright left them, Omori and Takayama began slowly moving up the ranks over the next few months. No Fear won their first title on June 4, 1999 when they defeated Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. One month later, on July 23rd, No Fear defeated Johnny Ace and Bart Gunn to win the World Tag Team Championship thus giving the team a monopoly on the All Japan tag team division.

Later she studied under Ernst Pauer and Sir George Macfarren. Zimmermann received the Kings Scholarship from 1860 to 1862 and made her public debut 1863 at The Crystal Palace playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. After ending her studies, Zimmermann went on a tour of Germany, followed by concert tours in 1879, 1880, 1882 and 1883.

She was the first woman appointed as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine and held a joint appointment in the Yale School of Public Health. Early life and education Horstmann was born on July 2, 1911, in Spokane, Washington and earned her undergraduate degree in 1936 from the University of California, Berkeley. She received her medical training at the University of California, San Francisco, earning her medical degree in 1940 and developed an interest in infectious disease after hearing lectures delivered by Karl Friedrich Meyer while at San Francisco General Hospital, where she performed her internship and residency.

Melnick, which used an approach they called \\"clinical epidemiology\\" to monitor polio outbreaks in Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York, as well as an outbreak in Hickory, North Carolina that was one of the worst in the century. At each site, the team analyzed sanitary conditions in the water supply, collected insects that might be possible vectors and took blood samples from patients with symptoms and those without, all as part of an effort to identify how the poliovirus was transmitted between people. Overturning the conventional wisdom that the polio virus affected the nervous system directly, Horstmann and her fellow researchers such as Robert W. McCollum discovered traces of poliovirus in the bloodstream, concluding that polio reached the brain by way of the blood.Staff. \\"Dr. Dorothy Horstmann dies - key in development of polio vaccine\\" , Yale Bulletin & Calendar, January 26, 2001.

Balaram (Njalile Veettil Edavalathu Balaraman) (20 November 1919 – 16 July 1994) was one of the founding leaders of the communist movement in Kerala, India.N E Balram remembered A Marxist ideologue, scholar in Indian Philosophy and a well known literary critic in Malayalam, he wrote on the history of the communist movement in Kerala, which is considered as the most authentic record of the early period. He also authored several works in history, philosophy, politics, and literature. Early life Balaram was born on 20 November 1919 in Pinarayi, a village near Tellicherry Town in the Kannur District of India. Incidentally, Pinarayi is the birthplace of the Communist Party of India in kerala, where it held its first meeting in 1939. Young Balaram (His real name was Balaraman, which was somehow shortened to Balaram) was an active member of that landmark conference held in a house near the village library, hardly 200 meters away from his home. He did schooling at a nearby village school. He studied up to 8th standard, which was considered (comparatively) a good school education at that time. After completing school, he became a faculty in a nearby school for a while. By then he was a known scholar in Sanskrit and Indian philosophy and had a good taste for spirituality which ultimately took him to the Ramkrishna Mission in Calcutta. There he spent several months learning more about the Vedas, the Upanishads and other ancient texts. He was dissatisfied with the ashram activities and returned to Kannur, a discontented young atheist. Immediately upon return he jumped into political activities as a Congress worker. A socialist group had already been formed in the Congress by that time at the national level and some of the Kerala leaders showed interest in that group. Within a short while Balram too became a member of the Socialist group. In 1938 he attended the 51st session of the Indian National Congress held in Haripura, Gujarat, where the socialist group came out openly against the policies of the Congress. Political Scenario Back in Malabar the Congress socialist group started the ground work to build a Communist movement in the state. P. Krishna Pillai, K. Damodaran, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, and N. C. Sekhar were the first team of leaders who took up this cause for which they met unofficially. Then came the historic meeting in Pinarayi, where the entire socialist leadership decided to convert to the Communist Party. The young Balaram was one of the main organizers of this first meeting of the Communist Party of Kerala. The meeting was presided by Com. P. Krishna Pillai, who was elected as the Secretary of the party on that day. All the senior members of the team were very happy about the meeting and all of them congratulated the organizers and especially the young Balaram for his organizational abilities. Even before the meeting, he had held informal discussions with top leaders like P. Krishna Pillai and theoretician K. Damodaran. They recognized him as a good communist and gave all support. He was actively involved in organizing the party. He was arrested by the police several times and imprisoned for almost six years. He was Secretary of the party in the Kottayam Taluk in the 1940s.  Election to State Assembly  In 1957, he was elected to the first Kerala Legislative Assembly from the Mattannur constituency. In 1960, he again represented Mattannur. In 1964, when the communist movement split into two on some ideological differences, Balaram stood with the original group known as the CPI (Communist Party of India). He was a member from the Tellicherry constituency to the Legislative body in 1970. He became a minister in the C. Achutha Menon ministry and held important portfolios like Industry and Public Relations. Next year he resigned from the ministry to take charge as the State Secretary of the Communist party of India. He held that post till 1984. Then he became the Secretary of the National Council of the party as well as the Member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament. He held both the posts till his death. He was the leader of the party in parliament also. He headed a Constitutional Reform Committee of the party when the Soviet Crisis erupted. Other interests He was a passionate reader of world literature and a critic of Malayalam literature. He wrote several books on various subjects, which include economics, physics, history, philosophy, politics and archaeology. Once, he was invited by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to help the team of archaeologists who held excavation in Vijaya Nagara, knowing fully that he was an expert in Pali language. During his last days he vehemently opposed the Hindutva Movement under the Bharatiya Janata Party and wrote books and articles against their activities. His voice was heard even by opponents as it always contained valuable and authentic information and clear analysis. Death He died of a cardiac arrest on 16 July 1994, aged 75.Kerala Legislature - members page He is survived by his wife and four children.

Career mode is a video game term referring to the mode of gameplay that involves taking control of a single character and guiding the character through their career. The mode is normally associated with sports games, where it is referred to by various names such as \\"superstar mode\\", \\"My Player mode\\", and \\"Road to the Show mode\\", in which a player controls the career of a single athlete. Normal features of the mode include tracking the character's statistics and customizing the character's appearance and attributes. Additional options may also be available, such as participating in various activities outside of the main gameplay, as in NBA 2K13 which allows players to spend virtual currency to make special appearances at charity functions to improve team chemistry. Compared to other modes of a typical sports or racing video game, the pacing in the early moments of career mode tends to be conservative and in favor of experience point/money grinding. This is especially true in games like Gran Turismo 6 where a player starts out with enough money to buy a lowly Honda Fit as their first vehicle. Features MLB 10: The Show features an extensive character creation feature. Players in the mode are normally rated, sometimes with a scale from 0 to 99 (with 99 being the highest score) in both the overall category and in various categories that correspond to a specific position (e.g., a quarterback in American football, a catcher in baseball, a point guard in basketball). Career mode generally rewards players for positive plays (such as scoring a basket, grabbing a rebound, hitting a home run, blocking a shot, or scoring a touchdown) and penalizes them for negative plays (like missed shots, throwing an interception, or striking out). During matches, gamers take the role of one specific player, controlling all of their actions with teammates controlled by the game's A.I. Normally a limited amount of control is provided over teammates such as calling for a teammate to pass or take a shot. Players can always benefit from the A.I. when they either take a shot that is appropriate for their skill level or pass to the receiver that they happen to see open. Some games such as the Madden NFL series award experience points that can be used to augment ratings of various skills. Games such as MLB 13: The Show, feature in-depth creation features allowing for control over many aspects of the in-game character. In addition to playing skills, other vital statistics such as eye color, weight, height, and date of birth may also be editable. Career mode may also span in-game years, taking a player from rookie year to retirement. While video games with career mode have been exclusively single- player in the past, Madden NFL 13 brings a true multiplayer career mode experience by allowing multiple players to play their career modes with each other at the same time. The only limitation is that players cannot be on a team that is controlled by a human-controlled coach. Recent games like NBA 2K13 and Madden NFL 13 have a fake social networking screen that operates similar to Twitter.

This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making). While directly elected government officials (i.e. ‘proxy representatives’) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final voting power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable (initiative). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.  Theoretical background  Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components: * Collaborative democracy, a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.www.collaborative- democracy.comCollaborative Democracy Network, Center for Collaborative Policy, California State University, Sacramento * Collaborative e-policymaking (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase policy process in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] Petrik, K. (2010) \\"Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. , JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)Collaborative Policy, Center for Collaborative Policy, California State University, SacramentoThe Australian National University, ANU E Press; Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia? *Proxy voting and liquid democracy: Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.Petrik, K. (2010) \\"Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making.\\", Digital Government Society of North America  Policy process  Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws & policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; domain experts; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives). * Suggestion & ranking phase: Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy crowdsourcing). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others. * Evaluation phase: For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts. * Voting phase: Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed. * Revision phase: A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved. To be clear, CPM is automated as a software process that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.  Principles  Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles: *Self-government, the ideal of direct democracy, and “quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “that which affects all people must be approved by all people”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies (Corporatocracy). *Open source governance, a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the open source and open content movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy. * Aggregation: One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad hoc groups to address these issues. *Collaboration: Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other. *Collective intelligence: The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of Web 2.0. * Collective learning & Adoption: The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices  Benefits and limitations  The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following benefits: *Transparency and accessibility: The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet. *Political efficacy: Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the democratic deficit. *Deliberation: The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information & communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation. * Collective awareness: Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation's collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies. On the contrary the concept has several limitations: *Constitutional limits: Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective. *Digital divide: People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded. *Majority rule: Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy. *Naivety: Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options. This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will. However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem. Increased education, critical thinking and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.  Research and development  In 2009 the two conceptions, collaborative e-democracy and collaborative e-policy-making, were first published at two academic conferences on e-governance and e-democracy: * Petrik, Klaus (2009) “Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision- making”; the 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: \\"Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data & Government\\" in Puebla, Mexico; * Petrik, Klaus (2009) “Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”; The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy in Vienna, Austria. * A third publication appears in the \\"Journal of eDemocracy and Open Government\\", Vol 2, No 1 (2010).

Croswell’s father and uncle were both influential editors and journalists in the early 19th century. Edwin expanded the family's influence on American journalism.  Early life  In 1800, while he lived in the Hudson River town of Catskill, Croswell's father, Mackay Croswell, started a newspaper called the Western Constellation. When it closed in 1804, Mackay Croswell started the \\"Catskill Recorder\\", in which he was later joined by his brother Harry Croswell. Harry had been named in a libel lawsuit, People vs Croswell, over an article about Pres. Thomas Jefferson that had appeared in The Wasp, a satiric newspaper that had been published for a few years in Hudson, NY. A contemporary of Edwin's, Thurlow Weed, said \\"Mr. Croswell, as a boy, was noticeable for the same quiet, studious, refined habits and associations which have characterized his whole life.\\"Obituary, The New York Times, June 16, 1871 When Croswell was seven, he had \\"the advantage of the best tutors in the locality to instruct his youthful mind.\\" He later attended college, where he studied English. When he was fourteen he began his apprenticeship at the family paper. By his mid-twenties, he had assumed more responsibility for writing, editing, and publishing the paper.  Albany years  In January, 1823, Croswell went to Albany, New York for the funeral of Judge Moses I. Cantine, the editor and one of the publishers of the Albany Argus. Cantine was a Catskill native, and had written articles for the Recorder. Martin van Buren and other members of the Albany Regency, an influential Democratic party machine, urged Croswell to take the position of assistant editor of the Argus. Accepting the position, he worked for Issac Q. Leake, who continued as publisher until the latter part of 1823, when he became too ill to continue. The Argus voiced Van Buren’s positions on questions of the day, including the construction of the Erie Canal, establishment of the national bank, and the states’ rights issue of 'nullification'; the Argus also disparaged Tammany Hall. On October 8, 1824, Croswell changed the paper from semi-weekly to daily publication. Articles in the Argus were reprinted in other papers throughout the state as embodiments of Democratic party principles. In 1840, Croswell was elected to the first of his two terms as ‘state printer’, which solidified his position in Albany. He retired from the Argus in 1854, succeeded by Gideon J. Tucker; Croswell sold his interest in the Argus, and engaged in business in New York City.  Late life  Croswell became involved with the U.S. Mail Steamship Company in the 1840s. In May 1855 Croswell, as director of the United States Mail Steamship Company, he was charged with fraud and dishonest acts (People v Croswell). Croswell was then removed as a director and had to replace the stolen money. His childhood friend, Thurlow Weed, continued to visit Croswell. Edwin Croswell died in Princeton, New Jersey at the age of 74.

In American English it is used as a metaphor meaning very high emphasis, or enthusiastic support.Eric Partridge, Tom Dalzell, and Terry Victor. The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z (2006) p. 1954 It was used in the 1972 U.S. presidential election by presidential candidate George McGovern who endorsed his running mate, Thomas Eagleton, \\"1000 percent\\" following a scandal, then soon after dropped him. Communication experts Judith Trent and Jimmy Trent agree with journalist Theodore H. White who called it, \\"possibly the most damaging single faux pas ever made by a presidential candidate.\\"Judith S. Trent, and Jimmie D. Trent. \\"The rhetoric of the challenger: George Stanley McGovern.\\" Communication Studies 25#1 (1974) p13. 1972 election It was most famously used by Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern in 1972. It backfired badly and became a byword for foolish and insincere exaggeration, and today is often used in irony or sarcasm.William Safire, Safire's New Political Dictionary (1993) pp 796-7 On July 25, 1972, just over two weeks after the 1972 Democratic Convention, McGovern's running mate for vice president, Thomas Eagleton, admitted the truth of news reports that he had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression during the 1960s, a fact kept secret from McGovern. However, McGovern had been running an emotional crusade against incumbent President Richard Nixon, with Nixon supporters counterattacking by suggesting that McGovern was crazy. The new evidence that his running mate had secretly undergone psychiatric treatment three times for mental illness destroyed the McGovern strategy. Eagleton was hospitalized in 1960 for four weeks for \\"exhaustion and fatigue.\\" He was hospitalized for four days at the Mayo Clinic in 1964, and for three weeks in 1966. He twice underwent electroshock therapy for depression.Time, Aug. 7, 1972 Influential Democrats questioned both Eagleton's ability to handle the office of Vice President and McGovern's competence in choosing top officials. In response to intense pressure from the media and party leaders that Eagleton be replaced, McGovern announced that he was \\"1000 percent behind Tom Eagleton, and I have no intention of dropping him from the ticket.\\"Theodore H. White, The Making of the President 1972 (1973), p. 203 McGovern subsequently consulted with psychiatrists, including Eagleton's own doctors, who advised him that a recurrence of Eagleton's depression was possible and could endanger the country should Eagleton become president. Consequently, on July 31, McGovern announced that he had reversed his position \\"in the interest of the nation\\", and Eagleton announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy to prevent continued diversion from greater issues, and for the sake of party unity.McGovern, George S., Grassroots: The Autobiography of George McGovern, New York: Random House, 1977, pp. 214-215Richard Michael Marano, Vote Your Conscience: The Last Campaign of George McGovern (2003), pp. 7 Theodore H. White, the journalist who followed the campaign most closely, reports that the \\"1000 percent\\" phrase was repeatedly mentioned over and over again by voters and damaged McGovern even more than his actual reversal of support for Eagleton.White, The Making of the President 1972 (1973), p. 203. The reason, according to Trent and Trent, was that McGovern's rhetoric throughout the campaign had been intensely moralistic and hyperbolic: he repeatedly emphasized his moral superiority over Nixon and Nixon's supporters. For example, in one speech McGovern attacked some Nixon advocates as \\"lousy, bitter, paranoid, predictable, despicable, obnoxious propagandists who are consistently wrong and who write nothing good about any candidate more liberal than Genghis Khan.\\" But now his own extreme language was exposed as fraudulent by his use of the 1000% metaphor.Trent and Trent, p 14, quote p. 18. Other uses The phrase was used long before 1972 by American politicians in a non-sarcastic fashion to indicate strong support for a political proposal. For example, retired President Harry Truman used it in his 1956 Memoirs..Harry S Truman, 1946-52: Years of Trial and Hope, Volume 2 (1956) Congressman Thomas used it to announce his support for controversial Senator Joe McCarthy in 1954.Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy: A Biography (1997) p. 604 Journalist Georgie Anne Geyer spoke of her \\"profound reluctance to get involved in just about any military endeavor that was not a clear win, that did not have 1,000 percent support of the American people\\". Writers used it often. For example, novelist Truman Capote wrote in 1958, \\"Prison is where she belongs. And my husband agrees one thousand percent.\\"Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's: a short novel and three stories (1958) p. 95 Novelist Alan Drury has a character in his political novel Advise and Consent (1959) state, \\"Those coal people, those pinball people. I want them behind us a thousand percent.\\" \\"Let's bat a thousand percent\\" is a common baseball saying since the 1920s when Babe Ruth used it. In private life the term is used to indicate high support in high-tension situations. Thus: \\"I would have expected 1000 percent support from my husband and yet I got none.\\" \\"Thanks to both of you for your 1000 percent support on this [missionary] journey.\\" When Donald Trump declared his candidacy for the U.S. presidency, his younger brother Robert told the New York Post, “I support Donald 1,000 percent.

He enjoyed a distinguished career until 1797, when he lost a battle and was dismissed as punishment. He was only reinstated in 1805. In that year he surrendered his command and was later brought up on charges. He died while awaiting a court-martial. Early career Born in the Württemberg royal residence on 13 October 1748,Smith & Kudrna, Franz Werneck. The implication is that Werneck was the illegitimate offspring of a prince, but Smith does not state this. Werneck entered the service of Habsburg Austria in 1764 as an Oberleutnant in the Weid-Runkel Infantry Regiment Nr. 28. Shortly afterward, he transferred to the Stain Infantry Regiment Nr. 50 as a Hauptmann (captain). After 20 years of service in the regiment he became its Oberst (colonel) in 1784. During the war with Ottoman Turkey, he led his troops in the first of several actions at Slatina- Timiş on 13 September 1788, where he captured a hill. The following year he fought at Mehadia. Werneck made his reputation on 30 September 1789 while leading the 1st Assault Column at the Siege of Belgrade. On this occasion his command included a battalion of the Stain Regiment, a battalion of grenadiers, and a company of volunteers. On 9 October after the siege was successfully concluded, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor appointed him General-major. On 19 December 1790, he was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.Smith & Kudrna, Franz Werneck French Revolutionary Wars After the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition, Werneck led a contingent of grenadiers with distinction at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November 1792.Smith & Kudrna, Franz Werneck. This source named Werneck as a brigade commander.Smith, p 31. Werneck is not listed in the detailed Jemappes order of battle. In December 1792, Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville led 20,000 French troops to overrun the Electorate of Trier. He was opposed by a force commanded by Friedrich Wilhelm, Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Kirchberg. The defenders were surrounded by 4 December, but thereafter they repelled repeated French attacks. In this stage of the fighting, Werneck commanded the Reserve at Grevenmacher which included single battalions of the Matheson Infantry Regiment Nr. 42 and Murray Infantry Regiment Nr. 55, plus two squadrons of the Latour Chevau-léger Regiment Nr. 31. By 17 December, the French effort collapsed and Beurnonville's army melted away.Smith, pp 34-35 Werneck served under Archduke Charles in 1796. Werneck was present at Aldenhoven on 1 March 1793 where Henri Christian Michel de Stengel's column was defeated by two Austrian cavalry regiments.Smith, p 42 He fought in the Battle of Neerwinden on 18 March. He served at the successful Siege of Valenciennes from 25 May to 27 July and at the failed Siege of Dunkirk from 24 August to 8 September. He led a brigade in József Alvinczi's Reserve at the Battle of Le Cateau on 29 March 1794. Promoted to Feldmarschall-Leutnant on 28 May, he served in the army of William, Hereditary Prince of Orange. In 1795 he led troops in François Sébastien de Croix de Clerfayt's army on the middle Rhine. The actions included the Battle of Mainz on 29 October, where he led the Reserve, and the Battle of Pfeddersheim on 10 November.Smith, p 108 Werneck served in Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen's brilliant Rhine Campaign of 1796. At the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, he led a division of 12 grenadier battalions in Wilhelm von Wartensleben's Reserve. His brigade commanders were Johann Kollowrat, Joseph von Schellenberg, and Ludwig von Vogelsang.Smith, p 122 On 18 September he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. When Charles took troops to join Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Werneck was left in command of the independent Army of the Lower Rhine beginning in September. His position remained unmolested by the French during the winter. On 18 April, Lazare Hoche and 38,000 French troops from the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse caught Werneck's 21,000 Austrians by surprise in the Battle of Neuwied. After heavy fighting, his soldiers were driven from the field with losses of 1,000 killed and wounded, plus 3,000 captured. In addition, 24 artillery pieces, 60 wagons, and five colors became trophies of the French. Total French losses were 2,000.Smith, pp 134-135 On 17 April, when Jean Etienne Championnet's division threatened Werneck's right wing, the Austrian general weakened his left under Pál Kray in order to bolster his right. When the divisions of Paul Grenier and François Joseph Lefebvre began crossing the Rhine at 3:00 AM, Werneck hurriedly ordered Kray's troops back to defend his left. Lefebvre defeated the Austrian left flank, while Grenier broke through Kray's line of redoubts at Heddersdorf after repeated assaults. Hoche's offensive forced the Austrians into a deep withdrawal which ended only with news of the Treaty of Leoben.Rickard, Battle of Neuwied After the defeat, Werneck was placed in retirement on half-pay. Napoleonic Wars Mack led the Austrian army to disaster. At the start of the War of the Third Coalition in 1805, Werneck was reactivated and appointed to the army in Germany. Despite some attempts at reform, the Austrian army remained wedded to 18th century concepts of warfare. The army's brigades and divisions were only semi-permanent units, and corps-sized formations were organized on an ad hoc basis. There were no corps and division staffs such as existed in the French army, which had permanent brigades, divisions, and corps. The French armies had won notable victories in 1800, but under Emperor Napoleon I of France they were even more powerful and effective in 1805.Epstein, pp 23-24 To Austria's greater disadvantage, the nominal army commander, Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este was at odds with his deputy, Karl Mack von Lieberich. The archduke and Mack's chief of staff Anton Mayer von Heldensfeld wanted to halt at the Lech River as originally planned, while Mack desired to keep marching to the Iller River at Ulm. After Emperor Francis I of Austria upheld Mack and sacked Mayer, the Austrian army began concentrating on the Iller. The flanks were held by Franz Jellacic's 11,000 troops near Lake Constance and Michael von Kienmayer's 12,000 men at Ingolstadt on the Danube.Rothenberg, p 89 While Jean Lannes's V Corps and Joachim Murat's Cavalry Corps moved directly east on Ulm, the rest of Napoleon's army swept past Ulm on the north bank of the Danube.Chandler, p 390 Crossing the river to the east of the Austrians, the French I, II, III, IV, and VI Corps got between Ulm and Vienna.Rothenberg, pp 90-91 Austrian defeats at the battles of Wertingen and Günzburg followed on 8 and 9 October.Smith, p 203 A breakout attempt failed on 11 October at the Battle of Haslach- Jungingen.Smith, pp 203-204 Finally, on 13 October, Mack ordered Werneck to march his corps northeast from Ulm in order to escape from the trap. His south flank was covered by Johann Sigismund Riesch's corps which held Elchingen. Archduke Ferdinand fled from Ulm with some cavalry.Rothenberg, p 92 Michel Ney's VI Corps smashed Riesch on 14 October in the Battle of Elchingen and forced the survivors to retreat to Ulm.Smith, p 204 Murat set out in pursuit of Werneck. On 16 October, there was a clash between Ney's cavalry and Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's division at Langenau. Murat caught a 5,000-man brigade under Rudolf Sinzendorf at Herbrechtingen on 17 October and wiped out half of it.Smith, p 205 On the same day, Ferdinand's cavalry fought off the French cavalry at NördlingenSmith, pp 205-206 and there was another clash with Werneck's troops at Neresheim. Murat and Ney with 28,000 troops cornered their adversary at TreuchtlingenSmith and Chandler both call this place Trochtelfingen. However, that town is in the wrong direction, 55 km west of Ulm. Treuchtlingen is 91 km northeast of Ulm, in the direction of escape. on 19 October. On that day Werneck capitulated with 15,000 troops, 28 guns, 12 colors, two standards, and four generals. Murat demanded that the terms include nearby Austrian units and Werneck accepted. Because of this the artillery reserve also surrendered. Hohenzollern refused to join in the capitulation and got away with 10 squadrons of cavalry. Ferdinand also managed to escape to Bohemia with Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg and 12 squadrons of horsemen.Smith, p 206 On 20 October Mack surrendered at UlmEpstein, p 27 with 20,000 infantry, over 3,000 cavalry, and 59 guns. For his surrender, charges were brought against Werneck. On 17 January 1806, he died of a stroke while awaiting court-martial at the fortress town of Hradec Králové (Königgrätz). Family Werneck's son Reinhard von Werneck briefly joined the Austrian military before transferring to the army of the Electorate of Bavaria.

In 1886, the Headlight bought out the Pittsburg Democrat, which had been published by Thomas P. Montfort. (Montfort had acquired that publication around 1881, when it was called The People's Exponent (founded 1880), and had renamed it.)

Its mission, revised in 2017, is \\"Celebrating Star Trek's vision of the future by promoting humanitarianism and STEM education today.\\" Gene Roddenberry's vision of a hopeful future, Starbase Indy reorganized as public benefit corporation with the purpose of raising the interest and improving the knowledge and skills of all ages in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through engagement in public discussion, lectures, and hands-on programs during our once a year event. We also work to eliminate prejudice and discrimination through intentional inclusivity, promotion of diversity, and specifically designed activities. Starbase Indy is held annually during the Friday through Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend in Indianapolis, Indiana. It draws attendees mainly from the Midwestern United States, but attendees have registered from as far away as Germany and Australia. History The idea for Starbase Indy germinated after Indianapolis Star Trek fans attended a convention in St. Louis and decided to create their own convention. The first Starbase Indy was held in March 1988 in the Adam’s Mark Hotel and the main guest star was Michael Dorn, who portrayed Worf in Star Trek: The Next Generation. In 1990, the convention moved to the Marriott East in Indianapolis and the now-traditional Thanksgiving weekend. Beginning in 1989, the convention adopted The Next Generation as part of its name, then the Third Generation in 1990, and so on. With Starbase Indy: The Eighth Generation in 1995, the local organizing committee ended the initial run of Starbase Indy. In 2004, after a professional convention company bowed out, a new fan-run committee organized Starbase Indy: the Ninth Generation. In 2008 Vulkon Entertainment, which had planned to take over the convention, bowed out days before the event. Local fans put together a one-day event, known as Freekon, and later in 2009 began meeting monthly to plan the 2009 Starbase Indy convention. The local organizing committee has continued the Thanksgiving weekend tradition ever since. For 2011, due to the hotel schedule, the convention had to be moved to Dec. 9-11. For 2012, the convention returned to its three-day Thanksgiving weekend tradition. In 2015, Starbase Indy returned to its original home, now known as the Wyndham Indianapolis West. In 2017, Starbase Indy began a rebranding effort, adopting a new mission statement, \\"Celebrating Star Trek's vision of the future by promoting humanitarianism and STEM education today.\\" While continuing the \\"Geek Family Thanksgiving Tradition\\" convention programming, organizers are also increasing the amount of science programming available at the convention.

For many decades, Harlem has had a lower quality of public education than wealthier sections of the city. It is mostly lower-income. But also check out the Harlem Children's ZoneHarlem Children%27s Zone For purposes of this article, the modern boundaries of greater Harlem are considered to be West 110th Street, Fifth Avenue, East 96th Street, the East River, the Hudson River, and 155th Street, although some variation occurs with the southwestern boundary. This area includes both the neighborhood of Harlem itself, as well as the adjacent neighborhoods of East Harlem, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights. Community districts New York City is divided into many Community School Districts (CSDs), although many functions formerly performed at the district level are now distributed elsewhere. Those districts with jurisdiction in parts of Harlem are Districts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 75, with 2, 3, and 6 also serving other parts of Manhattan and 75 being a citywide district covering special education schools. Some schools located outside of Harlem may have programs that take place in Harlem. An example is City-As-School, a public non charter high school headquartered in downtown Manhattan that supports education in conjunction with internships across the city, thus potentially including Harlem. History and quality of education In the 1930s, overcrowding in schools in Harlem was identified as a major impediment to education and a subject for reform efforts. Lucile Spence, Gertrude Elise McDougald Ayer, and Layle Lane were educators involved in the reform efforts.See pp. 223–225 in \\"Opportunities to enter a racially mixed high school were minimal, and by 1913 fewer than two hundred Black high school students attended racially mixed high schools,\\" Jeffrey Babcock Perry wrote in Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism in 2009.Perry, Jeffrey Babcock, Hubert Harrison: The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883–1918 (N.Y.: Columbia University Press, cloth [2nd printing?] 2009 ()), pp. 56–57. Id., p. 57 n. 12, cites \\"[f]or the statistics\\" Blascoer, Francis (sic (probably should be \\"Frances\\")), Colored School Children in New York (1915; N.Y.: Negro Universities Press, 1970). By 1993, Harlem was predominately African-American with incomes below the current national median. Many residents, who lived in poverty and thus were subject to racism as well as classism, found education disadvantaged. In standardized English and math tests, Harlem schools posted the worst average scores.Fliegel, Seymour, with James MacGuire, Miracle in East Harlem: The Fight for Choice in Public Education (N.Y.: Times Books (div. of Random House) (Manhattan Institute book) 1st ed. [2nd printing?] 1993 ()), p. 23. Not receiving Regents high school diplomas on time was more common in Harlem than in most other communities in the city by 2006. This excluded GEDs, special education diplomas, or alternative certificates, as well as children in the criminal justice system who were not counted.Losen, Daniel J., Behind the Dropout Rate, in GothamGazette: The Place For NYC Politics and Policy (§ Archives), Mar. 20, 2006, as accessed October 5, 2010 (website by Citizens Union Foundation) (author sr. educ. law & policy assoc., Civil Rights Project, Harvard Law School) (the article does not mention Harlem but the map in the article shows higher dropout rates in Census tracts that approximately coincide with Harlem). District 3, which covers most of southwestern Harlem as well as the Upper West Side, did not have any gifted & talented education programs in the Harlem section of the district , while in the Upper East Side, there are several gifted programs. The schools in the district are also highly segregated and are gradually losing enrollment to charter schools and better- performing schools elsewhere in the district. Most District 3 schools in Harlem are majority-black and Hispanic with decreasing enrollment over the years, while District 3 schools in the Upper West Side are mostly white with increasing enrollment. This is also true of Harlem schools in general. For example, PS 241 STEM Institute of Manhattan, a school on 113rd Street near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, lost three-fourths of its enrollment in ten years, going from 582 students in 2007 to 125 students in 2016. Less than 25% of kindergarten students zoned to PS 241 actually attend that school. It was proposed to be closed in 2008–9 but the school was kept open due to opposition from a teachers' union. An October 2016 proposal to merge PS 241 with nearby PS 76 was poorly received by parents from the latter school, so the 2016 merger was also canceled. By contrast, further south in district 3, 89% of kindergartners zoned to PS 87 on West 78th Street are enrolled in that school. Principals of Harlem public schools give different reasons for low enrollment. Some said that their schools had not been advertised enough, while others stated that charter schools promoted their own enrollment at the expense of public schools. , two Harlem schools, PS 180 and PS 185, had seen increases in enrollment in the preceding years. Of the nine charter schools in District 3 , eight are in Harlem. Many black and Hispanic families in Harlem send their kids to charter or private schools, or to better-performing public schools elsewhere in the district. The public non charter schools in Harlem have been criticized for decades as being educationally among the worst in the city. By contrast, the charters in Harlem have been praised for their quality of education, even when compared to charters elsewhere in the nation. Charters have been criticized on other grounds, but not uniquely to Harlem, except for objections to there being so many charters in Harlem competing with public non charter schools for classroom space. Transfers of teachers involuntarily into Harlem in the 1960s, by sending the teachers to schools with difficult students, were reputedly intended by the City's Board of Education to drive unwanted teachers out of the profession altogether.Kohl, Herbert R., 36 Children (N.Y.: New American Library (Plume book) (div. of Penguin) 1st Plume printing September 1988 [17th printing?] 1967 (copyright of main text) ()) (author taught Harlem public school 6th-grade classes in 1960s; school was at 119th St. & Madison Av.; book is an experiential journal)., p. vi (Introduction to the 1988 Edition (March 1988)). Columbia University has periodically planned physical expansion, competing for space with residents, and seeking coordination with New York State for the application of eminent domain on the ground of blight. Elementary through high school This covers pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. =Public schools= Publicly funded schools include non charter and charter schools, generally not charging tuition, and getting their funds primarily from state and city governments. Non charter schools PS 46 The New York City Department of Education runs public non charter schools in Harlem and provides a locator service for finding them. These include: * Central Park East * Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, a high school, 280 Pleasant Av. * Park East High School * Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem, 105 E. 106th Street. *The Ralph Bunche School 425 W 123rd St, New York, NY 10027 *P.S. 149 Sojourner Truth 21 W 111th St, New York, NY 10026 *John H. Finley Campus School, PS/MS 129M 425 W 130th St, New York, NY 10027 Charter schools Charter schools are authorized by any of three authorizing agencies and operate under fewer rules than do non charter schools, and often have higher expectations for students. In Harlem, many charters outperform non charter schools, doing a better job of educating students in math and English as measured by state examinations. Charters are generally free of tuition to attend. When a charter school receives more qualified applicants than it has classroom space to admit, it usually runs a lottery and places everyone who is not admitted that way onto a waitlist for possible openings later in the year. Schools offer classes in various grades and some add a grade each year, so that a student, once started, can continue studying in the same school. In Harlem, about 20 percent of children who are eligible by age are enrolled in charters, and that does not count applicants who are denied admission because of lack of room.

It is located in the west part of Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, China.  History  The garden was the old site of a house of Xu Dianyi who was a Qing dynasty scholar. In 1912 Wuxi Entrepreneur Rong Desheng the father of Rong Yiren purchased the land for the purpose of \\"Spread Fragrance to the World\\" and planted some 3000 plum trees. Because of the varieties of plum trees the place was named \\"The Plum Garden\\". The garden circles Rong's previous mansion and leans up against Mt. Longshan. Inside gardens the old owner Rong and nowadays Plum Garden management office set up Tianxin stage, Xixin spring, Qingfen pavilion, Nianqu pagoda (), Zhaohe pavilion, Xiaoluofu, Songbin hall, Huoran cave and Kaiyuan temple. The Nianqu pagoda was set up in 1930 for remembrance of 80th birthday of the dead mother of brother Rong Desheng and Rong Zongjing. It is the highest point of the plum garden and best place for watching blooming plum trees all over. Starting from Rong's family, The Plum Garden was called one of the three best places for appreciating plum trees in Jiangnan, together with plum trees in Mt. Dengwei of Suzhou and Mt. Chaoshan of Hangzhou. In 1955, Rong Yiren donated whole garden (except for the private mansion) to the country. In 1960, the garden expanded to Mt.

It was broadcast weeknights in prime time at 8 p.m. ET, replacing Campbell Brown in the same time slot. The show received consistently low ratings and there were reports of backstage fighting between Spitzer and Parker. On February 25, 2011, CNN announced that Parker had parted ways with the show to continue her work on her syndicated column but would continue to contribute to CNN. Spitzer remained on the show and the title was changed to In the Arena effective February 28. The show was canceled by CNN on July 6, 2011.CNN Cancels 'In the Arena' With Eliot Spitzer The New York Times July 6, 2011 The cancellation was effective August 8, 2011, when CNN went on to broadcast its flagship nightly news program AC360, anchored by Anderson Cooper, live at 8 pm and re-air in the time slot of 10 pm.CNN Announces New Evening Lineup. CNN Press Room, 6 July 2011. Retrieved 6 July 2011. Program details =Format and topics= In an interview published by The Hollywood Reporter, newly appointed CNN President Ken Jautz said the network was relying heavily on Parker Spitzer and on Piers Morgan replacing Larry King Live to raise ratings with \\"livelier and more engaging\\" programming. When asked what kind of ratings improvement he would consider a success, Jautz simply replied, \\"Higher.\\" On the show's main news blog, it states that it has the goal of facilitating a \\"dynamic exchange of opinions, ideas and analyses ... on the most important, compelling and amusing stories of the day\\". Spitzer has remarked, \\"We'll talk about movies sometimes, sports, we'll have everything under the sun, but we are clearly a political show.\\" A recurring segment in the program is a challenge to legislators called \\"Name Your Cuts\\", about the U.S. national debt. =Ratings and reviews= The show premiered to poor ratings, finishing fourth place among cable news programs in its time slot. Among people from ages to 25 to 54, the show garnered 118,000 viewers compared to 722,000 for The O'Reilly Factor. Spitzer remarked in response, Parker Spitzer arguably has not helped CNN's prime time since, leaving the network with its worst prime- time ratings in 10 years. On December 7, The New York Times stated that \\"at the two-month mark, the ratings for CNN's latest experiment are stagnant.\\" Parker has described the show's relationship to viewers as \\"absolutely a work in progress\\". Critical reaction has largely been negative. After the show's debut episode, The Huffington Post summarized that \\"[b]y and large, television critics from around the country were scathing in their assessment\\". Reviewers such as those from The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times have criticized the show for being one-sided, with Spitzer dominating over the more demure and meekly spoken Parker. Critics such as James Poniewozik writing for Time have panned the sometimes flirty nature of the back-and-forth between Parker and Spitzer. Dennis Rodman and Andrew Jenks talk, along with other guests, on the show on November 19, 2010. When Washington Examiner columnist Richard Viguerie appeared on the show, he accused it of having a left-of- center bias, saying to Parker: In response, Parker has said, \\"No matter how great we are or how good a job we do, critics are going to be critics\\". During a stretch in which Spitzer hosted the show solo and Parker took a leave of absence because of a lung infection, ratings doubled without Parker compared to episodes with her. =Backstage tensions= The show has been dogged by reports of backstage tensions between Spitzer and Parker. The Page Six gossip column in The New York Post stated in early November that Parker had stormed off the set. When asked about the reports, Parker said, \\"I don't storm. I saunter.\\" =Parker's departure= On Friday, February 25, 2011, CNN announced that Parker would depart from Parker Spitzer, with Spitzer continuing to host the program, under the new name In the Arena, effective Monday, February 28, 2011. Parker's last words, \\"On a personal note, today is my last day on the show, and I just want to thank you, the viewers, for tuning in. I look forward to seeing you down the road.\\" =Cancellation of the show= On July 6, 2011, CNN announced the cancellation of In the Arena. The same time slot would be filled by Anderson Cooper's show \\"Anderson Cooper 360°\\", which will also continue in a rerun in its current slot; no new show will replace it.Eliot Spitzer Show CANCELED on CNN.

He was a professor of mechanics in the University of Turin and University of Naples. He is best known for his contributions to the field of exterior ballistics. Biography Siacci graduated from the University of Rome in 1860 and received an honorary degree in mathematics. In 1861, he moved to Turin and enlisted in the army amidst the period of Italian unification. He also became a professor of mechanics at the Military Academy. He remained there until war broke out in Italy in 1866. Siacci was briefly part of the campaign against the Austrians in a war in 1866, until he was sent back to Turin to teach ballistics at the Military Academy. In 1871, he began teaching mechanics in the University of Turin. A year later, he was promoted to Professor of Ballistics at the School of Applied Artillery and Engineering in Turin and held that post until his retirement from the army as a major general in 1892. In 1875, he became a Professor of Higher Mechanics in the University of Turin. After two terms as a deputy in 1892, Siacci was appointed as a senator in Rome in 1893. Since Turin is far from Rome, he requested a transfer to the University of Naples to capably serve as senator and still teach. Consequently, Vito Volterra took over his vacated position in Turin, but Siacci retained an honorary professorship there. Siacci stayed to teach in Naples for the rest of his life. Siacci was a member of the most important national academies in Italy, including the Accademia dei Lincei (corresponding member in 1872, full member in 1890), the Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL, the Accademia delle Scienze in Turin, and the Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e Matematiche in Naples. A street in Rome, the Via Francesco Siacci, is named after him. Exterior ballistics Siacci is well known for his contributions in the field of ballistics, distinguishing himself with a famous treatise Balistica, published in 1888 and translated to French in 1891. Of great importance is an approximation method he devised to calculate bullet trajectories of small departure angles. Known as Siacci's method, it was a major innovation in exterior ballistics and was widely used almost exclusively at the beginning of World War I. Several modifications of the method are still in use today, including those of H.P. Hitchcock and R.H. Kent, and James Ingalls. Siacci also studied theoretical mechanics (Siacci's theorem, rigid body dynamics, canonical transformations, and inverse problems) and mathematics (theory of conic sections, Riccati differential equation, etc.). Siacci's theorem Siacci's theorem in dynamics is the resolution of the acceleration vector of a particle into radial and tangential components, which are generally not perpendicular to one another. Siacci formulated this decomposition in two papers which were published in 1879, the first for planar motions, and the second for spatial motions. The theorem is useful in situations where angular momentum is constant (for example, in central forces). References * \\"Accademia della Scienze di Torino\\" * \\"Francesco Siacci Biography\\" * J.

The congregation, a member of the Presbyterian Church USA, was founded in 1692 and played a prominent role in the founding of Presbyterianism in America. The current edifice was completed throughout 1751-53 and was named in memory of pastors John Tennent and his brother William Tennent. The Old Tennent Cemetery is located on the same property. It is managed by the Old Tennent Cemetery Association. The church itself is a historic Revolutionary War site. Patriots fought and won victory over the British close by, in the Battle of Monmouth. The church building was used as a temporary hospital for wounded soldiers. History Having had continuous existence for more than ten generations; The congregation was formed in 1692 by a group of Scottish Dissenters who had fled their homeland to escape James II's severe persecution for their beliefs. It has occupied its existing building since 1751, and the structure has undergone little fundamental change. The church once served as a hospital during an engagement in the War for Independence—the Battle of Monmouth—which raged around it on June 28, 1778.http://www.oldtennentchurch.org/Church_Location/churchhistory.html Notable burials * Joshua Huddy American Revolution patriot.

Setting This ecoregion is located on the north coast of Alaska, and includes the east coast plain of Banks Island, as well as the Anderson River and Horton River plains, and the Tuktoyaktuk coast in the Northwest Territories. This is an area of low, flat, boggy coastal plains. The underlying soil of this damp Arctic coast is thick, solid permafrost, covered in summer with thermokarst \\"thaw lakes\\" of melted ice. Ice features such as ice wedges and pingo mounds of soil and ice can be found. This coast has an arctic climate warm enough to allow plant growth in late-June, July and August only, and even then frosts may occur. On the whole this is a damper, wetter area than the Low Arctic tundra ecoregion that continues along the coast west of here to Quebec. Flora This area supports wetland plants especially sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens, and right on the coast there are peat bogs. Trees such as dwarf birch, willows, northern Labrador tea (Dryas) and alders grow in the warmer areas of the region, the Mackenzie River delta and the Yukon coast. Fauna This region provides calving habitat for four herds of caribou, the Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Central Arctic, and Porcupine caribou herds. Another key species is the muskox of Banks Island and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge coast. Other mammals include lemmings, polar bear, walrus, beluga whale, snowshoe hare and Arctic hare, red fox, grey wolf, Arctic ground squirrel and seals. The coast is also home to many breeding waterbirds including snow goose, spectacled eider, Steller's eider, king eider, and yellow-billed loon. Important bird areas include the Colville River delta, Teshekpuk Lake (which is within the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska), and Kasegaluk Lagoon a breeding area for brant goose. Predatory birds include the snowy owls that hunt waterbirds and lemmings. Fish of the waters here include the Arctic char. Threats and preservation 90% of natural habitat remains intact, except for the vicinity of Utqiagvik, Alaska and the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska and Kuparuk which are expanding along the coast and may in future spread into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is the only major protected area on this coast (see Arctic Refuge drilling controversy), and on and around the Dalton Highway and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.

The drama also propelled Felix Wong to instant stardom, and it became Wong's first representative work since graduating from TVB's Artiste Acting Class in 1980. Synopsis Lee Tong (Felix Wong) grew up with only one intent in mind: revenge. After his gangster father died in the hands of friends Fang and Fong, Tong was raised by his father's henchman, trained to be a lone assassin. Coming of age, he finally sets his plan into action and kills an underworld boss. Timid driver Au-yeung Gong (Michael Miu) unwittingly witnesses the crime but is too scared to rat out Lee, leading to an unexpected friendship. Gong ends up helping Tong enter the organization, laying the path for Tong's revenge.

The mine opened in 1969 and operated until its closure on 30 June 1987. Its coal was mined for the operation of the Swanbank Power Station. Explosion The Box Flat Mine disaster occurred on the 31 July 1972 when 17 miners lost their lives after an underground gas and coal dust explosion, 14 men who were working in the vicinity of the explosion and three miners who were working on a belt adjacent to the mine entrance. An eighteenth man Clarence Edwin Wolski died on 20 February 1974 as a direct result of injuries sustained in the Box Flat explosion. Eight of the dead were part of the mine rescue team. At 6pm on 19 July, spontaneous combustion occurred in a pile of fallen coal in No. 2 level of Box Flat No.5 mine, assisted by a scheduled fan stoppage, during which reduced air flow allowed self-ignition of the coal heap. This developed into a large fire over an 8-hour period, assisted by the increased air flow when the mine fan was restarted. An explosive mixture of gases generated from the fire, water gas and coal dust, was ignited with resulting explosions in No 5 and No 7 mines, which were interconnected, at 2.47am. A mine warden who was sent to investigate the explosion died later as a result of his injuries and some workers at the surface were also injured in the explosion. A later report found that safety requirements and regulations at the mine had not been complied with at the time of the accident, although it stopped short of concluding that these lapses were the cause of the disaster. After the explosion, it was determined that no one could have survived and the decision was made not to send in rescuers in case there would be another explosion and instead seal the tunnel's entrances. The miners' bodies were never retrieved. The incident was the worst mining disaster in Ipswich's history. Memorial A memorial can be found at the old mine-site on Swanbank Road located near the power station. It honours those who lost their lives in the Box Flat Mine disaster. A bridge on an extension to the Centenary Highway is named in honour of the lives lost in the 1972 disaster. Legacy The Box Flat Mine was serviced by the Bundamba- Swanbank coal line. After the Box Flat Mine closure the need to transport coal to fuel the power station became imperative. The Bundamba-Swanbank coal line transported most coal to the power station, so an additional balloon loop was built for the delivery of coal. There are now two balloon loops located on the branch line, the first balloon was used to stockpile coal for the power station, this loop is known as Box Flat. The second loop is known as Swanbank balloon and was used to deliver coal directly to the power station. The power station now uses gas as fuel and coal is no longer required. The line has two uses. Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway operates a heritage steam train tour on a section of the line through the Box Flat balloon. It is also used by Queensland Rail to transport rail ballast from the stockpile which is kept at Box Flat.

After South Balsam Street, the street name changes again to South Pioneer Way, only for Route 171 to make a left turn onto a new segment of East Broadway Avenue, while BL-90 curves from northeast to south-southeast. After East Hill Avenue, the road curves more directly southeast, and later intersects Washington Route 17, which joins the route in a concurrency until finally reaching I-90 at exit 179, which is a diamond interchange with a south to east loop ramp. =Ritzville spur= Interstate 90 Business is a business spur (incomplete loop) of Interstate 90 in Ritzville, Washington, running through the city along the former alignment of U.S. Route 10, only connecting to I-90 at its west end.

Beyond the airport property, BL-90 ran beneath US 2 with no access, and then turned onto an eastbound only wye interchange with West Sunset Boulevard, which merged as a one-way pair with 3rd Avenue eastbound and 2nd Avenue westbound. At Scott Street, the route left 3rd and 2nd Avenue moved northeast to Sprague Way, then merged onto the bidirectional Sprague Avenue beneath State Route 290 at Pines Road.

The business route designation was proposed by businesses and the city government in 2012, along with $60,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to fund the installation of signs along Sprague Avenue. The designation was approved by AASHTO in May 2013, and its 18 signs were installed by the city by the end of the year. Sprague Avenue had previously been part of U.S. Route 10, the transcontinental predecessor to I-90, and reached its present width of in 1949. The city rebuilt Sprague Avenue in 2017, adding wider sidewalks, new crosswalks, and plants. Idaho =Post Falls loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Post Falls. The route links I-90, which bypasses downtown Post Falls to the south, and downtown Post Falls, and terminates at I-90 at each end. It begins at I-90 exit 2 in Post Falls. It goes north to Seltice Way. The business loop turns east and follows Seltice Way through downtown. Seltice Way goes under I-90 at exit 6\\\\. This interchange is the eastern terminus of I-90 Business (Post Falls). Seltice Way continues east to an intersection with I-90 Business (Coeur D'Alene) at Northwest Blvd. I-90 Business is a segment of former U.S. Route 10 (US 10) and I-90 alignment through Idaho. US 10 was designated in 1927. US 10 and I-90 entered Idaho on Seltice Way at the Washington-Idaho state border. The highways followed Seltice Way and Northwest Boulevard into Coeur D'Alene. The highways followed Sherman Avenue east through downtown town Coeur D'Alene. Then, the highway turned south and followed Lake Coeur D'Alene Drive and Yellowstone Trail along the shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene to the Coeur D'Alene National Forest. The highway moved to the present I-90 route after the freeway and Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge was completed in the early 1990s. =Coeur d'Alene loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Coeur D'Alene. The route links I-90, which bypasses downtown Coeur D'Alene to the north, and downtown Coeur D'Alene. As its Business Loop designation implies, I-90 Business terminates at I-90 at each end. It begins at I-90 exit 11 in Coeur D'Alene. It goes southeast on Northwest Boulevard. I-90 Business intersects Seltice Way (former US 10 & I-90) just south of the freeway. I-90 Business intersects U.S. Route 95 at a diamond interchange just north of the Spokane River. The business loop continues southeast past North Idaho College turns east on Sherman Avenue near a city park, beach, marina, and the Lake Coeur d'Alene Resort. Sherman Avenue carries the I-90 Business through downtown and out to an interchange with I-90 at exit 15\\\\. This interchange is the eastern terminus of I-90 Business. I-90 Business is a segment of former U.S. Route 10 (US 10) and I-90 alignment through Idaho. US 10 was designated in 1927. US 10 and I-90 entered Idaho on Seltice Way at the Washington-Idaho state border. The highways followed Seltice Way and Northwest Boulevard into Coeur D'Alene. The highways followed Sherman Avenue east through downtown town Coeur D'Alene. Then, the highway turned south and followed Lake Coeur D'Alene Drive and Yellowstone Trail along the shore of Lake Coeur d'Alene to the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. The highway moved to the present I-90 route after the freeway and Veterans Memorial Centennial Bridge was completed in the early 1990s. =Osburn spur= Interstate 90 Business is business spur of Interstate 90 in Osburn. It runs south from a diamond interchange at exit 58 along North Third Street to East Mullan Avenue (former US 10). Originally, the route was part of a loop leading from North Third Street along East Mullan Avenue to Silver Valley Road to Markwell Avenue in Silverton. =Silverton spur= Interstate 90 Business is a business spur of Interstate 90 in Silverton. It runs south from a diamond interchange at exit 60 along Markwell Avenue to Silver Valley Road (former US 10), although most of the \\"business\\" is located north of that interchange. Originally, the route was part of a loop leading from west from Markwell Avenue along Silver Valley Road into Osburn, where it led to East Mullan Avenue, then turned right onto North Third Street finally ending at exit 58 in Osburn. =Wallace loop= Interstate 90 Business (also signed as The Harry F. Magnuson Way) is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Wallace. The route links I-90, which goes north of the city, and downtown Wallace. As its Business Loop designation implies, I-90 Business terminates at I-90 at each end. This section of Interstate 90 Business contains what was the last traffic light on a coast-to-coast Interstate highway. It begins at I-90 exit 61 in Wallace. It goes southeast on former U.S. Route 10 and the initial route of I-90. I-90 was rerouted to the freeway in 1991. I-90 Business follows the main road through Wallace. Locally, the route is known as Front Street, 5th Street, and Bank Street. I-90 Business intersects State Highway 4 at an at-grade intersection. This intersection is also the I-90 interchange with Highway 4. I-90 Business terminates at this interchange signed as exit 62\\\\. I-90 Business is a segment of former U.S. Route 10 (US 10) and the original I-90 alignment through Idaho. US 10 was designated in 1927. US 10 became co-signed with I-90 in the 1960s. Eventually, I-90 replaced US 10 in Idaho. When the I-90 freeway opened in 1991, the US 10 alignment became I-90 Business. The intersection of Bank Street (US 10, I-90) and Seventh Street was the last traffic light located on a coast-to-coast Interstate highway. It was one of the last, if not the last, removed from a primary Interstate highway. It is the only traffic signal in Wallace and was put into flash mode when the new I-90 viaduct opened. I-90 Business passes through the Wallace Historic District. In 1979, several blocks of downtown Wallace were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. City leaders organized the effort to recognize the historic district to prevent the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Idaho Department of Transportation (IDOT) from condemning and demolishing the city's core to build an at-grade freeway. The FHWA and IDOT designed and built an elevated viaduct to finish the interstate freeway. =Mullan loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Mullan. It runs from an eastbound only flyunder interchange at exit 68 where it immediately crosses a bridge over the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River and runs along River Street, running northeast and parallel to the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes. After the intersection of 3rd Avenue curves from northeast to east as it runs over a second bridge over the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. The road crosses over the river a third time after the intersection with Copper Street. After the intersection with Eighth Avenue, the route makes a reverse curve to the left and becomes Friday Avenue, where it passes by a small connecting road to Earle Street in front of a high school football field. While Friday Avenue continues east towards national and local parkland, as well as some mining areas, BL 90 turns south onto Atlas Road and crosses the last bridge over the Coeur d'Alene South Fork to end at a diamond interchange for exit 69\\\\. Montana =Alberton loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Alberton. It runs from a diamond interchange at exit 75 on I-90 at Railroad Avenue, then to Adams Street, and finally to another diamond interchange with Petty Creek Road (S-507) at exit 77\\\\. =Missoula loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Missoula. The business route begins at a diamond interchange with I-90/MT 200 at exit 101 (Reserve Street), which is also the eastern terminus of the overlap with U.S. Route 93. As it crosses over a railroad bridge, it immediately leaves US 93 at an interchange with West Broadway Street, and turns southeast. BL-90 briefly parallels the south side of the former Northern Pacific Railway line but turns away at the intersection with Railroad Street West, still remaining in a relative southeast trajectory. The road briefly turns straight east before the intersection with North Russell Street, but returns southeast at Toole Street. Between Hawthorne and McCormick Streets, it runs directly along the north bank of the Clark Fork River before reaching the Heart of Missoula. At Higgins Avenue, West Broadway Street becomes East Broadway Street, and at Madison Street, the route is joined by another concurrency with U.S. Route 12. BL-90/US 12 run along East Broadway Street together for three blocks until it reaches Van Buren Street, where they both turn north, and run under a bridge for that same NP line it encountered under Reserve Street, and BL-90 finally ends at a diamond interchange with I-90/MT 200 at exit 105, while US 12 continues east along an overlap with I-90 until it reaches exit 174 in Garrison. =Deer Lodge loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Deer Lodge.

At the intersection of Montana Street, BL-15/90 make a left turn, while West Iron Street continues east onto a disjointed intersection as a local two-lane street. The route run along Montana Street until the intersection with West Park Street, which is a local two-lane street. At Main Street, West Park Street becomes East Park Street. Two and a half blocks after this it intersects Arizona Street and Avenue and turns south onto Arizona Avenue, which makes a sharp turn to the southeast at Curtis Street. Just before the intersection with East Platinum Street, the routes veer off to the right onto Utah Avenue. Four blocks south of there, it crosses a Great Northern Railroad line, one block west of the former GN Depot. Utah Avenue ends at East Front Street across from a former Northern Pacific Railroad depot and BL-15/90 makes a left turn there. At the intersection with Atlantic Street, East Front Street then curves to the southeast to run under a bridge beneath the former Northern Pacific Railroad line becoming Harrison Avenue. The westbound route has a sign above the bridge for the welcoming motorists to the Butte National Historic Landmark District, but both sides have signs for the former Burlington Northern Railroad. The first notable site along the way is the Greyhound Bus station and Greyhound Package Express office, right next to the tracks and across from the Butte Civics Center. Other sites along the way include the former Harrison Avenue Theater, and the NRHP-listed Socialist Hall. At Massachusetts Avenue, the routes turn straight south, and then ends at a partial cloverleaf with I-15/90, while Harrison Avenue continues as Montana Highway 2. =Bozeman loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Bozeman.

Business Loop 90 begins on Interstate 90 at exit 99, the interchange with CSAH 39 (North Bixby Road) and runs south, where it passes through farmland as it encounters the eastern terminus of CSAH 130, and is renamed 190th Avenue. The surroundings become slightly more industrial, as it passes the Martin County Fair just before crossing a former Milwaukee Road railroad line, and then makes a left turn at CSAH 26. While making this transition, the street name for CSAH 26 changes from 120th Street to Lake Avenue. BL-90 runs directly east until it curves to the southeast, where it briefly runs parallel to the ex- Milwaukee Road Line and both the routes and track cross bridges between George Lake and Sisseton Lake. Immediately after passing by the Martin County Courthouse, Lake Avenue ends across from the intersection of First Street and North and South Main Streets. BL-40/CSAH 26 runs south along South Main Street for one block before turning east again onto East Blue Earth Avenue where they remain overlapped until BL-40 makes a left turn onto Minnesota Trunk Highway 15, and runs north. BL-40/MN 15 cross the old Milwaukee Road line for the last time and then another one that branches off from this line further west in the city. Between the two crossings frontage roads start to parallel the road until the intersection with Margaret Street (CSAH 132). North of the bridge over Center Creek, Business Loop 90 ends at exit 102 on I-90, while Trunk Highway 15 continues north through New Ulm, Hutchinson, and the St. Cloud Area. =Austin loop= Interstate 90 Business is a business loop of Interstate 90 in Austin.

After the intersection with 14th Street Northwest (former US 218), the road becomes a one-way pair, and MN 105 turns south onto 12th Street Southwest. Meanwhile, eastbound BL 90 runs along First Avenue Southwest, while westbound BL 90 remains along Oakland Avenue West. At Main Street, First Avenue Southwest and Oakland Avenue West both become First Avenue Southeast and Oakland Avenue East, and the one way pair ends at Fourth Street Southeast, and eastbound BL 90 turns left (north) to rejoin its Oakland Avenue counterpart. BL 90 crosses a bridge over Cedar River where Oakland Avenue East becomes Oakland Place Southeast. After the intersection with 10th Street Northeast it runs beneath a railroad bridge, then curves to the northeast to cross another bridge over Dobbins Creek and run along the east side of East Side Lake. Interstate Business Loop 90 ends at exit 180A on I-90/US 218, the latter of which leaves it's concurrency with I-90 at exit 180B.

It was preceded by weeks of continuous rains and snows in the very high elevations that began in Oregon in November 1861 and continued into January 1862. This was followed by a record amount of rain from January 9–12, and contributed to a flood that extended from the Columbia River southward in western Oregon, and through California to San Diego, and extended as far inland as Idaho in the Washington Territory, Nevada and Utah in the Utah Territory, and Arizona in the western New Mexico Territory. The event dumped an equivalent of 10 feet of rainfall in California, in the form of rain and snow, over a period of 43 days. Immense snowfalls in the mountains of the far western United States caused more flooding in Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, and Sonora, Mexico the following spring and summer as the snow melted. The event was capped by a warm intense storm that melted the high snow load. The resulting snow-melt flooded valleys, inundated or swept away towns, mills, dams, flumes, houses, fences, and domestic animals, and ruined fields. It has been described as the worst disaster ever to strike California.  Background  The weather pattern that caused this flood was not from an El Niño type event, and from the existing Army and private weather records, it has been determined that the polar jet stream was to the north as the Pacific Northwest experienced a mild rainy pattern for the first half of December 1861. In 2012, hydrologists and meteorologists concluded that the precipitation was likely caused by a series of atmospheric rivers that hit the Western United States along the entire West Coast, from Oregon to Southern California. An atmospheric river is a wind-borne, deep layer of water vapor with origins in the tropics, extending from the surface to high altitudes, often above 10,000 feet, and concentrated into a relatively narrow band, typically about wide, usually running ahead of a frontal boundary, or merging into it. With the right dynamics in place to provide lift, an atmospheric river can produce astonishing amounts of precipitation, especially if it stalls over the same area for any length of time. Prior to the flooding, Oregon had steady but heavier than normal rainfall during November and heavier snow in the mountains. Researchers believe the jet stream slid south accompanied by freezing conditions reported at Oregon stations by December 25. Heavy rainfall began falling in California as the longwave trough moved down over the state, remaining there until the end of January 1862 and causing precipitation everywhere in the state for nearly 40 days. Eventually the trough moved even further south, causing snow to fall in the Central Valley and surrounding mountain ranges.  Impact by region  = Oregon = There was an excessive amount of precipitation in November 1861 over most of Oregon, less so in the extreme northwest. It was cold enough at the higher elevations that much snow fell in the Cascade Range, which, when later melted by the warm rains produced a great quantity of water that flooded into the Willamette River and other streams in the Cascades. Tributaries of the Willamette rising in the Oregon Coast Range did not rise so high. Then the depression that came in at the beginning of December produced strong, warm southerly winds in Oregon, with extremely heavy rain. The crest of the flood was reached at Salem on December 3; at Oregon City on the 4th; at Milwaukie, between Oregon City and Portland, on the 5th; at Albany on December 8, a second rise at Albany greater than the first. The crest at Albany and Salem were the highest ever known at any time. In Oregon, the flood was one of the largest in the history of the Willamette Valley and the rest of Western Oregon. Flooding was heaviest on rivers with tributaries arising from the snow-covered Cascade Range. An article in the December 14, 1861, Oregon City Argus, described the course of the flood at Oregon City: Flood waters were so high that at Oregon City at the flood's crest on December 5, the steamer St. Clair was able to run the falls, and steamers were able to visit points at some distance from the normal river channel. Although large amounts of wheat and flour were swept away, some was recovered when Oregon City's Island Mill was found on Sauvie Island downriver from Portland. The nearby town of Linn City was completely destroyed by flooding and was not rebuilt. In addition, the flood destroyed the historic town of Champoeg, site of the first provisional government in Oregon, and Orleans, across the Willamette River from Corvallis. Neither was rebuilt. The flooding was also severe in other parts of Oregon; the Umpqua River had the greatest flood known even to the oldest Native Americans, and water was higher than the 1853 flood. It rose from November 3 to December 3, subsided for two days, then rose again until the 9th. At Fort Umpqua, communication upriver was cut off above Scottsburg, and the river was full of floating houses, barns, rails and produce. The Coquille River swept away settlers' property and there was also great damage on the Rogue River and on other small streams.\\" Flood damage was so great because the rivers in Oregon were the main routes of travel. The river front was the building site of mills, freight depots, and storehouses for grain and other foodstuffs. Business houses and many residences were near the landings. Farm buildings were mostly on sites convenient to the rivers, along with supplies of feed for livestock. Loss of so much wheat flour and demand from the new Idaho gold fields caused a spike in its price from $7 to $12 per barrel. = Idaho = In the interior of Washington Territory, in what is now Idaho, the storm creating the flood in Oregon dumped its precipitation as an unprecedented snowfall. Flooding on the Columbia River and the snow in the mountains closed off supplies to the new mining towns on the Salmon River, causing starvation among the miners of Florence, cut off from December until May 1862. In early July, as the heavy burden of snow in the mountains melted, the runoff caused great flooding. The Boise River flooded from extremely high runoff and is believed to have been four times larger than its largest recorded flood in 1943. Flood waters made the river expand to a couple of miles wide. It washed away or covered the original route of the Oregon Trail in the river valley. = California = California was hit by a combination of incessant rain, snow, and then unseasonally high temperatures. In Northern California, it snowed heavily during the later part of November and the first few days of December, when the temperature rose unusually high, until it began to rain. There were four distinct rainy periods: The first occurred on December 9, 1861, the second on December 23–28, the third on January 9–12, and the fourth on January 15–17. Native Americans knew that the Sacramento Valley could become an inland sea when the rains came. Their storytellers described water filling the valley from the Coast Range to the Sierra.  Northern California  Fort Ter- Waw, located in Klamath Glen, California, was destroyed by the flood in December 1861 and abandoned on June 10, 1862. Bridges were washed away in Trinity and Shasta counties. At Red Dog in Nevada County, William Begole reported that from December 23 to January 22 it rained a total of , and on January 10 and 11 alone, it rained over . At Weaverville, John Carr was a witness to the sudden melt of snow by the heavy rain and onset of the flood in December 1861 on the Trinity River: Two years later William H. Brewer saw near Crescent City, the debris of the flood:  Central Valley  The entire Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys were inundated. An area about long, averaging in width, and covering was under water. The water flooding the Central Valley reached depths up to , completely submerging telegraph poles that had just been installed between San Francisco and New York. Transportation, mail, and communications across the state were disrupted for a month. Water covered portions of the valley from December 1861, through the spring, and into the summer of 1862. In Knight's Ferry, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada astride the Stanislaus River, about east of Modesto, the town's homes, its mill, and most of its businesses were ruined by the flood. The bridge spanning the river initially withstood the flood waters but was destroyed when the debris of the bridge at Two-Mile Bar, only a short distance up river, torn from its foundation, crashed into the Knights Ferry Bridge, crushing the truss supports and knocking it from its rock foundation.Mildred Brooke Hoover, H. E. Rench, E. G. Rench, Historic Spots in California, Third Edition, Stanford University Press, Stanford, 1966. pp. 540–541 Knight's Ferry. All Sacramento, excepting one street, part of Marysville, part of Santa Rosa, part of Auburn, part of Sonora, part of Nevada City, and part of Napa were under water. Some smaller towns like Empire City and Mokelumne City were entirely destroyed.  Sacramento  Sheet music cover depicting Sacramento flooding Sacramento, sited at the junction of the Sacramento and American Rivers, was originally built at above low-water mark, and the river usually rose almost every year. The New York Times reported on January 21, 1862 that a trapper who had spent more than 20 years in California had frequently boated over the city's site, and in 1846, the water at the location was deep for sixty days. On 27 December 1861, the Sacramento River reached a flood level of above the low water mark, after rising during the past 24 hours. The Sacramento flood plain quickly became inhabited by a growing population during the Gold Rush served as the central hub for commerce and trade and the home of political leadership, the California State Legislature. The landscape was recognized as a flood prone landscape located at the confluence of the American and Sacramento River. John Muir noted the extent of seasonal flooding in Sacramento, \\"…The greatest floods occur in winter, when one could suppose all the wild waters would be muffled and chained in frost and snow…rare intervals warm rains and warm winds invade the mountains and push back the snow line from 2000 to 8,000 feet, or even higher, and then come the big floods.\\"Muir, J. (1894). The Mountains of California: Chapter 11 The River Floods. The Century Co., New York. However, the series of storms that led to the Great Flood of 1862 averaged precipitation levels that records show only occur once every 500 to 1,000 years. The geographical range of flooding in the state was noted by a traveling geologist from Yale University, William Brewer, who wrote that on January 19, 1862, From December to January 1862 the series of storms carrying high winds and heavy precipitation left city streets and sidewalks underwater. Photographs show canals in place of city streets and boats docked to storefronts. On Inauguration Day, January 10, 1862 the state's eighth governor, Leland Stanford, traveled by rowboat to his inauguration building held at the State Legislature office. Much of Sacramento remained under water for 3 months after the storms passed. As a result of flooding, the California State Legislature was temporarily moved to San Francisco during rebuilding and renovating the sunken city of Sacramento. ;Levee damage The city of Sacramento suffered the worst damage due to its levee, which lay in a wide and flat valley at the junction of the American and Sacramento rivers. When the floodwaters entered from the higher ground on the east, the levee acted as a dam to keep the water in the city rather than let it flow out. Soon the water level was higher inside than the level of the Sacramento River on the outside. John Carr wrote of his riverboat trip up the Sacramento River when it was at one of its highest stages of flood: Dozens of wood houses, some two stories high, were simply lifted up and carried off by the flood, as was \\"all the firewood, most of the fences and sheds, all the poultry, cats, rats and many of the cows and horses\\". The Chinese in their poorly built shantytowns were disproportionately affected. A chain gang was sent to break open the levee, which, when it finally broke, allowed the waters to rush out of the city center and lowered the level of the flooding by . Eventually the waters fell to a level on a par with the lowest part of the city. From January 23, 1862, the state capital was moved from flooded Sacramento to San Francisco. ;City Rebuilding Politicians addressed the flood risk with an investment of more than $1.5 million in flood control and prevention through improved levee system around Sacramento and the greater Sacramento area.Null, J., Hulbert, J. (2007). California Washed Away: The Great Flood of 1862. Weatherwise, 27-30. Sacramento put efforts into restructuring the city's foundation by re-channeling the American River, reinforcing the established levee system, and passing a two-decade project to raise the city above flood level. Due to the high costs associated with flood recovery, the city of Sacramento reached out to the aid of the Transcontinental Railroad Co. which was a major turning point in levee resilience and reconstruction. Prior to the great flood, levee breaks and failures caused much destruction from flooding. The Transcontinental Railroad had laid tracks across the Sierra Nevada and stationed its major repair and production line in Sacramento. At the time, Chinese labor force consisted of immigrants accustomed to the Mediterranean climate that closely resembled that of their homeland. The Chinese workforce of over 14,000 works reconstructed levees under the guidance of Charles Crocker, the head contractor for Central Pacific Railroad. In response to a weak levee system and seasonal flooding, flood plain architecture was incorporated in residential infrastructure evident in Victorian buildings throughout Midtown to Downtown Sacramento. Flood design includes raised front porches with stairs leading down to the street. In addition, small hollow spaces are built into the basement level to allow for basement flooding and aeration.Castaneda, C., and Simpson, L. (2013). River City and Valley Life: An Environmental History of the Sacramento Region, University of Pittsburgh Press. Old Town Sacramento was raised 15 feet above flood level. Ruins of the old city remain underneath the streets as tunnels leading nowhere with hollow sidewalks, filled in entrances, trap doors, and rubble where storefronts and walkways used to be. Large wooden beams and dirt brought in from surrounding areas helped to stabilize and build on top of the once flooded city.  Southern California  In Southern California, beginning on December 24, 1861, it rained for 28 days in Los Angeles. In the San Gabriel Mountains the mining town of Eldoradoville was washed away by flood waters.\\"The Great Floods of the San Gabriel Mountains\\" by Cecile Page Vargo, Explore Historic California, February 2005 The flooding drowned thousands of cattle and washed away fruit trees and vineyards that grew along the Los Angeles River. No mail was received at Los Angeles for five weeks. The Los Angeles Star reported that: The plains of Los Angeles County, at the time a marshy area with many small lakes and several meandering streams from the mountains, were extensively flooded, and much of the agricultural development that lay along the rivers was ruined. In most of the lower areas, small settlements were submerged. These flooded areas formed into a large lake system with many small streams. A few more powerful currents cut channels across the plain and carried the runoff to the sea. In Los Angeles County, (including what is now Orange County) the flooding Santa Ana River created an inland sea lasting about three weeks with water standing deep up to from the river. In February 1862, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and Santa Ana Rivers merged. Government surveys at the time indicated that a solid expanse of water covered the area from Signal Hill to Huntington Beach, a distance of approximately . At Santa Barbara County, the narrow coastal plains were flooded by the rivers coming out of the mountains. The San Buenaventura Mission Aqueduct that was still drawing water from a tributary of the Ventura River for the town of Ventura water system, was abandoned due to the damage in the area that become the separate Ventura County in 1873. In San Bernardino County, all the fertile riverside fields and all but the church and one house of the New Mexican colony of Agua Mansa, were swept away by the Santa Ana River, which overflowed its banks. Father Borgotta ringing the church bell on the night of January 22, 1862, alerted the inhabitants to the approach of the flood, and all escaped. In San Diego, a storm at sea backed up the flood water running into the bay from the San Diego River, resulting in a new river channel cut into San Diego Harbor. The continuous heavy downpour also changed the look of the land, the previously rounded hills were extensively cut by gulleys and canyons. To the north, in the Owens Valley, similar snow and flooding conditions as those to the east in Aurora, Nevada (see below), led to the local Paiute suffering the loss of much of the game they depended on. Cattle newly driven into the valley to feed the miners, competed with the native grazers and ate the native wild plant crops the Paiute depended on to survive. Starving, the Paiute began to kill the cattle and conflict with the cattlemen began, leading to the subsequent Owens Valley Indian War.  Economic impact  On March 1862, the Wool Growers Association reported that 100,000 sheep and 500,000 lambs were killed by the floods. Even oyster beds in San Francisco Bay near Oakland were reported to be dying from the effects of the immense amounts of freshwater entering the bay. Full of sediment, it covered the oyster beds. One-quarter of California's estimated 800,000 cattle were killed by the flood, accelerating the end of the cattle-based ranchero society. One-fourth to one- third of the state's property was destroyed, and one home in eight was carried away or ruined by the flood-waters. Mining equipment such as sluices, flumes, wheels and derricks were carried away across the state. An early estimate of property damage was $10 million. However, later it was estimated that approximately one-quarter of the taxable real estate in the state of California was destroyed in the flood.William H. Brewer, Up and down California in 1860–1864, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1930, p. 243 Retrieved 23 October 2010. The state almost had to declare bankruptcy due to the costs of the damage and the loss of tax revenue. = Nevada = The Carson River Basin of the eastern California and western Utah Territory (now Nevada), suffered from a similar pattern of flooding. Flooding began in December 1861 in Carson Valley from a series of storms in the upper Carson River basin. of wet heavy snow fell on December 20, 1861, accumulating on the valley floor. Snow was followed by a period of very cold temperatures which froze the snow, followed by a three-day rain starting on December 25, 1861. By January 2, 1862, the town of Dayton and the area surrounding it had been flooded.U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1973, Water and related Land Resources, Central Lahontan Basin, Carson River Subbasin, Nevada and California, Special Report: History of Flooding, Carson Valley and Carson City Watershed, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, Minden, NV. In the vicinity of Aurora, there had been light snowfall in November, then mild weather until Christmas Eve, when there began a heavy and rapid snowfall for days. The temperature dropped below zero and the passes over the Sierras were closed. During the second week of January, it warmed slightly, and the snow became a torrential rain. Esmerelda and Willow gulches overflowed their banks and flooded Aurora. With water standing up to deep in many buildings, adobe buildings turned to mud and collapsed. After a week, it cooled again, and snow began to fall again. Within a few days, the snow was deeper than it had been before the rains had begun to fall. Samuel Young of Aurora recorded in his diary that the snow and rain had fallen for 26 days out of 30 since December 24, 1861. = Utah = The early southwestern Utah settlements in Washington County: Fort Clara, St. George, Grafton, Duncans Retreat, Adventure, and Northrop were nearly destroyed by a flood on the Virgin and Santa Clara Rivers, that followed 44 days of rainfall in January and February 1862.P. Kyle House, Ancient floods, modern hazards: principles and applications of paleoflood hydrology, Volume 1, American Geophysical Union, 2002, p. 297 Survivors of Fort Clara established the modern town of Santa Clara a mile east of the old fort on the Santa Clara River.FORT CLARA (aka FORT SANTA CLARA), Santa Clara, Utah from wchsutah.org accessed September 24, 2015 Springdale and Rockville were founded in 1862 by settlers flooded out of Adventure, Northup and other places in the vicinity. = Arizona = In western New Mexico Territory, heavy rains fell in late January, causing severe flooding of the Colorado River and Gila River. On January 20, 1862, the Colorado River began to rise, and on the afternoon of January 22 it rose suddenly in three hours from an already high stage nearly , overflowing its banks and turned Fort Yuma in California into an island in the midst of the Colorado River. At 1 o’clock on the morning of January 23, the river reached its crest.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies Ser. I, Vol. 50, P. I, Ch. LXII–Correspondence, January 23, 1862 Letter from Major Edwin A. Rigg, Fort Yuma, to Col. James H. Carlton, commanding Southern District, pp.815-818 Jaeger City a mile down river from Fort Yuma, and Colorado City, across the Colorado River from it were washed away. The river overflowed its banks to the extent that there was water deep on a ranch in the low-lying ground just above Arizona City where the Gila River joined the Colorado. The riverside home of steamboat entrepreneur George Alonzo Johnson and the nearby Hooper residence were the only places in the town unharmed because they were built on high ground. Colorado City had to be rebuilt on higher ground after the 1862 flood.Thomas Edwin Farish, History of Arizona, Volume I. The Filmer Brothers Electrotype Company, San Francisco, 1915. pp. 252–253 The Gila River also flooded, covering its whole valley at its mouth where it met the Colorado from the sand hills on the south to the foothills on the north. to the east of Fort Yuma, it swept away most of the mining boomtown of Gila City along with a supply of hay being gathered there to supply the planned advance of the California Column into Confederate Arizona. Further east the road was flooded, buildings and vehicles swept away and traffic was disrupted for some time thereafter by the mud covering the road to Tucson.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies Ser. I, Vol. 50, P. I, Ch. LXII–Correspondence, pp. 865–868 The great flood in the Gila and Colorado rivers, covered their bottom lands with mud. Much of the livestock along the rivers drowned and the crops of the Indians along the river were destroyed.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies Ser. I, Vol. 50, P. I, Ch. LXII–Correspondence, p. 851 The overflow of the 1862 Colorado River spring flood waters reached the Salton Sink via the Alamo and New Rivers, filling it and creating a lake some long and wide.Wheeler, G.M., Annual report on the geographical surveys West of the one-hundredth meridian, in California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, and Montana: Appendix JJ, AnnualReport of the Chief of Engineers for 1876: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office. 1876, = New Mexico = The great snow pack laid down during the winter of 1861–62, in the southern Rocky Mountains, and other ranges, the sources of the Rio Grande, caused a great spring flood in that river that changed its course in the Mesilla Valley. The flood also impeded the operations of the California Column attempting to cut off the retreating Confederate Army of New Mexico. On July 8, 1862, Lt. Col. Edward E. Eyre, First California Volunteer Cavalry wrote: Instead of crossing at Messilla, the high waters and course change forced Eyers detachment to cross the Rio Grande, up river at the old San Diego Crossing below Fort Thorn, after waiting another week for the water to go down, which allowed the rearguard of the Confederate Army to escape into Texas. Messilla, built on the west bank of the Rio Grande after the Mexican–American War, was left by the movement of the river on its east bank where it remains today. = Sonora, Mexico = Until the Great Flood of 1862, what became Port Isabel Slough, in Sonora, Mexico, was a shallow tidewater slough, but the extreme flood waters of that year cut its channel much deeper, so that at low tide it still was three fathoms deep. The mouth of this slough was only from the mouth of the river and sheltered from the extremes of the tidal bore of the Colorado River and deep enough to prevent stranding on shoals or mud flats at low tide. This made it an ideal anchorage for maritime craft to load and unload their cargo and passengers from the steamboats that took them up and down river without the danger from the tides that they were having to risk in the estuary at Robinson's Landing. In the month of March 1865, the schooner Isabel, from San Francisco, commanded by W. H. Pierson, found and entered this slough and discharged her cargo there for the first time. Subsequently, the steamers, sailing ships and later ocean-going steamships loaded and off-loaded their cargoes there, and the steamboat company established Port Isabel above the mouth of the slough. The port lasted until 1878. After the Southern Pacific Railroad reached Yuma, it was abandoned the following year, the shipyard there being removed to Yuma.  Current interest  A map of the flood area of the hypothetical ARkStorm event The storm was not an unprecedented occurrence. Geologic evidence has been found that massive floods, of equal or greater magnitude to the 1861-1862 event, have occurred in California roughly every 100 to 200 years. The United States Geological Survey has developed a hypothetical scenario, known as the \\"ARkStorm\\", that would occur should a similar event occur in modern-day California.

The plot concerns a black teenager living in a predominantly white environment and having trouble coping as he reaches an age at which the realities of racism are beginning to affect his life more directly and pointedly than they had in his childhood. Adapted from the Broadway play by Louis S. Peterson, the film stars Johnny Nash - who would ultimately become more well known for his singing career, including the hit song \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" - as the lead character, Spencer \\"Spence\\" Scott. Co-stars included Ruby Dee as the Scott family's housekeeper, Estelle Hemsley as Grandma Martin (Hemsley was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actress), and Beah Richards as Spence's mother. The movie's executive producer was Burt Lancaster through his Hecht-Hill-Lancaster production company.Reid, Mark A. “Take a Giant Step. A Raisin in the Sun; The U.S. Black Family Film\\". Jump Cut; A Review of Contemporary Media. No. 36. May 1991. Pages 81-88. Plot Spencer \\"Spence\\" Scott (Johnny Nash) is a 17-year-old black high school senior who has lived his entire life in a middle-class white neighborhood of an unnamed city in the northern United States. Having been raised with a sense of self-respect, he is starting to become frustrated by the effects of racism. When his history teacher speaks ill of the intellect of black slaves during the American Civil War, he objects, and when the teacher dismisses the objection, he storms angrily out of the classroom and slips into the bathroom to calm down by smoking a cigar. He is discovered there and is suspended from school. At the same time, his white friends are beginning to exclude him from their activities because they want to include girls, and none of the girls' parents approve of their daughters socializing in circles that include a black boy. Spence confides in \\"Gram\\" (Estelle Hemsley), his ailing but wise grandmother, but he cannot face the prospect of telling his parents (Frederick O'Neal, Beah Richards) what has happened, so he decides to leave home, catching a bus into a black neighborhood. His time on his own is short-lived, however, as he is socially unprepared for an adult world. Although he is intelligent and well-read, he finds that his academic knowledge doesn't carry him far as he approaches an attractive older woman in a bar (Ellen Holly), presenting to her a very logical case as to why he'd be a good boyfriend, and assuring her that he'd be willing to marry if they were to fall in love. He is disillusioned to discover that the woman is unhappily married and wants only to find a man in the bar who has some money and a nice car, so that she can have a one-night fling with him to temporarily escape from her troubles. Upon returning home, Spence's parents berate him for not having stayed \\"in his place\\" when dealing with white people, as they have learned to do. Spence tells them that he ashamed of them for that attitude and Gram comes to Spence's defense, chiding the couple for not supporting him in his stance against his teacher's racism. She notes that they moved to the middle-class neighborhood to help instill in Spence a sense of self-respect that he might not have attained if he'd grown up in a slum, but they are now angry at him for displaying that very self-respect. She also criticizes their emphasis on providing him material comforts, as opposed to spending time with him, as evidenced by the fact that they are completely unaware of his having recently become something of an outcast among his peers. After Gram dies, Spence turns to Christine (Ruby Dee), the Scotts' housekeeper. He confesses to her both his sexual frustration and his overall loneliness. He proposes that since Christine is lonely also - she is a widow, her only child was stillborn, and she is probably over a thousand miles removed from any of her family - they might find some happiness together for a short time, even if their age difference precludes a long-term relationship. To her own surprise, Christine finds that she is actually considering the idea, but the decision is made for her when she is terminated from the household. Spence's mother reasons that with the family no longer needing anyone to look after Gram, a housekeeper is unnecessary. She is also perceptive enough to be wary of a possible romantic relationship developing between Spence and Christine. Frustrated by his mother's decision and the fact that she has asked his friends to come over and spend time with him, Spence grows very angry at her over the idea of his having to beg people to be friends with him. His mother grows just as angry in return, insisting he will learn that having to swallow such humiliations is just part of being black in a white-dominated world. Unable to discern any course of action that will alleviate his current unhappiness, Spence ultimately decides simply to persevere and focus upon building a brighter future for himself. He politely tells his friends that he won't have time to see them anymore, later explaining to his mother that he \\"said goodbye to them before they say it to me\\" because he had accepted that they were only his friends \\"up to a point\\". His mother still doesn't believe that that was the right course of action, but says that she only wants him to be happy and the film ends with the two affirming their love for one another.

Nash said that he was told that Burt Lancaster saw him on television, thought he would be right for the part and had him brought in to audition. Nash acknowledged that the story sounded like it might be \\"a press agent's dream\\", but said that he liked the story so much, he preferred to just accept it, rather than ever ask Lancaster whether it was true.(1960, June 4). \\"Singing Not Enough for Nash the Actor\\", The Spokesman-Review Frederick O'Neal, Beah Richards and Estelle Hemsley had all performed in the stage version of Take a Giant Step, prior to being cast in the film. Reception Once the film wrapped, United Artists had difficulty distributing it due to objections over its content. The film's full release was delayed into the middle of 1960, as it was re-edited and censored.Stern, Harold. (1960, June 4). \\"Nash Takes 'Giant Step'\\", The Milwaukee Sentinel Once released, the film was negatively reviewed by The New York Times as an \\"unworthy film\\" that handled the lead character's problems \\"in a clumsy, shoddy fashion\\". The review credited Nash with an \\"earnest\\" performance, but said that he lacked \\"poignancy\\". Supporting actress Ruby Dee was praised as \\"sensible and sympathetic\\". But aside from these points, the review was sharply critical of the script, directing, and acting performances.Crowther, Bosley. (1961, March 6). \\"Confused Hero: Johnny Nash Has Lead in 'Take a Giant Step'\\", The New York Times Hemsley, however, received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.

Life Saphir was the son of the merchant Gottlieb (Israel) Saphir and his wife Charlotte Brüll. During the reign of Joseph II all Jewish subjects had been required to take a family name, and Israel Saphir was the first in the family to use that surname. Moses was sent to the yeshiva in Bratislava to become a rabbi. At the age of eleven he fell out with his family and made a risky journey to Prague to attend that city's yeshiva instead. Shortly afterwards he encountered mainstream European literature and began to study English, German, and the Romance languages. In 1814 his family removed all financial support and he was forced to return home. Nevertheless he was allowed some time later to travel to Pest, Hungary in order to study Latin and Greek. It was in Pest that he embarked on a literary career. His first book, Poetische Erstlinge (1821), was received with enthusiasm. He was invited to Vienna by the publisher Adolf Bäuerle to write for the Wiener Theaterzeitung. However, Saphir's merciless reviews and essays were so unpopular that in 1825 he was sacked, whereupon he left for Berlin, where he edited the arts pages of the Berliner Schnellpost für Literatur, Theater und Geselligkeit, also contributing to the Berliner Courier and Berliner Theateralmanachs auf das Jahr 1828. On 3 December 1827 he founded the Tunnel über der Spree literary society, as a kind of \\"personal bodyguard\\" according to Theodor Fontane. However, as an eloquent satirist he made more enemies in Berlin, and his prominent associates in the society could not (or eventually, would not) always help him out of scrapes. The playwright Kurt Schall challenged him to a duel, and a satirical poem about Henriette Sontag in the Spenerschen Zeitung even led to a short term of imprisonment. In 1829, he went to Munich where he helped found Der Bazar (1830) and Der deutsche Horizont (1831). Once again his satires (in this case an attack on the Bavarian royalty) resulted in imprisonment and deportation. Fleeing to Paris, he quickly achieved fame through a series of lectures, and he received an invitation from Louis Philippe I, but he returned to Bavaria in 1831 and took over the editorship of the Bayerische Beobachter. The following year he converted to Protestantism. His apologetic manner and newfound restraint resulted in official forgiveness, and even an appointment as a functionary in the Royal Bavarian Court Theatre. In 1834 he returned to Vienna, which was to remain his main residence for the rest of his life. He was forbidden to start his own newspaper, and worked instead for the Theaterzeitung. On 1 January 1837 the ban was lifted and on the same day he founded Der Humorist (1837-1862), a daily satirical publication which he edited until his death in 1858. During the Revolution of 1848 he became the first head of a Revolutionary Writers' Association, but with the continuation of unrest he resigned and retreated to Baden until the situation had resolved. The restraint displayed in his later work meant that a new generation of writers began to see him as \\"reactionary\\". His enmity towards Johann Nestroy and friendship with Ignaz Franz Castelli are well- known. He also made lecture tours throughout Germany, France and Austria. After returning from one such trip he separated from his wife. In the summer of 1858 he travelled to Baden, where he died on 5 September at the age of 63. His last words were \\"Now all is over, I have to go.\\" The executor of his will was Friedrich Hebbel. He was buried in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery (1/168) in Vienna.

Of changeable views, he spent a period of his life in the United States, where he associated with leading abolitionists. Early life Barker was born 11 May 1806, at Bramley, near Leeds, where his father was employed in the woollen manufacture. He was the fourth son of a family of eleven, and was engaged as a wool-spinner. His childhood was one of privation, and his education was chiefly at a Sunday school. His parents were Wesleyans; he was enrolled a member of the community, in which he became an occasional preacher, and then a home missionary and exhorter. After about three years of probation and trial, he was a local preacher. He was then sent to a Methodist school at Leeds, kept by James Sigston. Leaving the Wesleyan communion, Barker joined the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion. In this body he officiated for a year, 1828–9, as assistant to the superintendent of the Liverpool circuit, which he left with a recommendation to go out as a travelling preacher, on trial. Barker was appointed successively to the Hanley circuit 1829–30, and to the Halifax circuit 1830–1. At Halifax, contrary to the rule for preachers of his standing, he married a Miss Salt, of Betley, in Staffordshire, and was sentenced by the next conference to lose a year of his probation. He went on to Blyth, in the Newcastle-on-Tyne circuit, 1831–2, a disciplinary migration; and to the Sunderland circuit for six months, 1832–3, with residence at Durham. Popular if accused of heretical views, he was in 1833 admitted into 'full connexion,' and appointed, by an innovation, the third married preacher at Sheffield, 1833–5. While at Sheffield and afterwards in the Chester circuit, 1835–7, Barker strongly advocated teetotalism. From 1837 to 1840 he conducted a weekly periodical called The Evangelical Reformer. At the conference of 1839 he was moved from Mossley to Gateshead, a comparatively new circuit, and there denounced socialism. Barker was expelled from the Methodist New Connexion, at the conference which met at Halifax in 1841, on the grounds that he \\"had denied the divine appointment of baptism, and refused to administer the ordinance\\". After his expulsion, which was followed by a loss to the Connexion estimated at \\"29 societies and 4,348 members\\", Barker became the pastor of a church in Newcastle-on-Tyne, which had, like himself, left the Methodist New Connexion. Here it was Barker's custom to deliver daily lectures, followed by free discussions. He became a printer, and in addition to other publications began to issue a periodical called The Christian; his adherents were known as Barkerites. At this period he held a ten nights' discussion with the Methodist Rev. William Cooke. 1845–1860 Barker, whose views were constantly changing, for a time inclined to Quakerism, and afterwards to Unitarianism. In 1845 he preached in Unitarian chapels, in London and elsewhere. The Unitarians enabled him to start a printing establishment on a larger scale at Wortley, a suburb of Leeds, where, on 6 July 1846, a steam printing-press, which had been provided at a cost of some £600l., was publicly presented to him by Dr. John Bowring. Some months previously Barker had issued a Proposal for a new library of three hundred volumes, the cheapest collection of works ever published. He now issued week by week a series of cheap books, theological, philosophical, ethical, and otherwise, under the title of the \\"Barker Library\\". Here also he published anonymously an autobiographical work, The History and Confessions of a Man, as put forth by himself, Wortley, 1846; which was substantially reproduced in Barker's Review, 1861–3, as The Life of a Man, and in the posthumously published Life of Joseph Barker, written by himself, London, 1880. In 1846 Barker went into politics, advocating republicanism for England, repeal for Ireland, which he had visited in June and July 1845, and the nationalisation of the land. He started a weekly periodical called The People to propagate his opinions, which reached a circulation of over 20,000. In 1847, in the course of which year he made a six months' tour in America, he foretold, in his Companion to the Almanac, the French revolution of 1848. Barker threw himself into the Chartist agitation which followed, as the advocate of \\"peaceful legal measures\\". After the summer assizes in 1848, the judge at Liverpool issued bench warrants for the arrest of a number of political agitators, including Barker. He was arrested about six weeks later, and taken to the city gaol at Manchester. He was detained until four o'clock on the next day, when the magistrates took bail; and Barker went to Bolton, where he had been the same day elected M.P. for the borough by a large majority, though he never sat in parliament. Whilst still waiting for trial at the Liverpool winter assizes, Barker was elected a member of the town council of Leeds. At the assizes the attorney-general at the last moment entered a nolle prosequi, and Barker was set free. His views were now something like deism. In 1851 he moved with his family to Central Ohio. In the United States he joined the anti-slavery party, and associated with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips Garrison, Henry C. Wright, and other leading abolitionists. From Wright he accepted the principle of nonresistance. Barker settled in Nebraska, where he purchased a large tract of land at a low price. In the summer of 1857, he began a long lecture tour. In Philadelphia he fulfilled an engagement of eight months, during which he lectured every Sunday. After spending a few weeks with his family in Nebraska, he returned to Philadelphia in August 1858, to undertake another eight months' course of lectures. Barker sailed from Boston 11 January 1860, for England, and having landed at Liverpool proceeded to Betley, in Staffordshire, the native place of his wife. His wife and children followed in August of the same year, and found him already engaged in secularist propaganda as one of the editors of the National Reformer, a position which, however, he then vacated in disgust. Later life On a re-examination of the Bible, Barker then began to retrace his steps towards orthodoxy, and to doubt \\"the beneficent tendency of infidelity\\". The process of return is documented in Barker's Review of Politics, Literature, Religion, and Morals, and Journal of Education, Science, and Co- operation, a publication he started on Saturday, 7 September 1861, after he had abandoned what he called the \\"unbounded license party\\". In 1862 he became lecturer to a congregation of an eclectic kind of 'unbelievers' at Burnley, where he lived and laboured for more than a year, enforcing precepts of morality, and often taking occasion to speak favourably of the Bible and Christianity. He was formally reconciled to his old religious belief, and afterwards preached, at their invitation, to the Methodist reformers of Wolverhampton. After accepting invitations from the Primitive Methodists of Bilston and Tunstall, he joined their community as a local preacher, and held the office until 1868. Barker was in bad health, and the death of his wife at Nottingham about this time, affected him greatly. He returned to America and stayed for a short time at Omaha, where his estate had become a valuable property; then went east, and made Philadelphia his headquarters. He printed books and tracts in defence of the Christian religion. After spending the winter of 1874–5 at Boston, he slowly travelled back to Omaha in the following spring, resting with friends at New York and Philadelphia on his way. He died at Omaha on 15 September 1875, and was buried there. A few days before his death he declared that he \\"died in the full and firm belief of Jesus Christ, and in the faith and love of His religion as revealed in His life and works, as described in the New Testament.\\" Works Other writings by Barker were his Christianity Triumphant, Wortley, 1846; The Life of William Penn, the celebrated Quaker and Founder of Pennsylvania, London and Wortley, 1847, the second volume of the Barker Library; Lectures on the Church of England Prayer- book, Wortley, 1847; Confessions of Joseph Barker, a Convert from Christianity, London, 1858, a letter addressed to George Jacob Holyoake, from Omaha city, Nebraska, 22 July 1858, and reprinted from The Reasoner; and the Life of Joseph Barker, written by himself, 1880, the autobiographical portion of which was brought down to the year 1868, with later details, and commentaries, supplied by Joseph Barker, junior, and J.

It is distinct from Asian mahjong in several ways. American mahjong utilizes racks to hold each player's tiles, jokers, and \\"Hands and Rules\\" score cards. It has several distinct gameplay mechanics such as \\"The Charleston\\",How to Play American Mahjong which is a set of required passes, and optional passing of the tiles. American mahjong is played with four players using tiles stamped with Chinese symbols. The goal of the game is to be the first, by picking and discarding, to match one's tiles to a specific hand from the annually distributed scorecard published by the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) and American Mah-Jongg Association (AMJA). Scoring is done by matching the points assigned to each pre-determined hand on the annually distributed NMJL card & AMJA card. History Joseph Park Babcock, a representative of the Standard Oil Company in Shanghai, was importing mahjong sets to the United States in great numbers by 1923. To increase interest in the game, which was sometimes impenetrable to Westerners, he rewrote and published new, more simplistic rules that became the American standard. When the National Mah Jongg League, Inc. published a volume of \\"Official American Rules\\" in 1935, the American style further morphed into a very distinct form.The History of Mahjong American mah jongg tournament standards and rules were established in 1986, when the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness jointly conducted their first annual Mah Jongg Tournament at Sea. This tradition of championship tournaments at sea continued for over 34 years. Now there are American mah jongg tournaments conducted throughout the United States, and consist of players from America and Canada. Mah Jongg Madness conducts more than a dozen tournaments a year and an annual NMJL cruise culminates in the National Mah Jongg Convention in Las Vegas every March. Tournaments are now played according to the STANDARDIZED MAH JONGG TOURNAMENT RULES, which were codified and published in 2005. https://mahjongg.org/index.php/rules In 2011, MAH JONGG MASTER POINTS (MJMP) were established to post an individual's tournament scores. The MJMP website formulates the scores (awarding bonus points to the top ten (10) winners of an event), and ranking the individual players.

Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the carbon cycle to identify opportunities to address human-induced climate change and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities. Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.Hegerl, G.C. et al.

Freshwater Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.Clarke & King (2006) pp. 20–21.

Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. In the industrial world demand management has slowed absolute usage rates but increasingly water is being transported over vast distances from water-rich natural areas to population-dense urban areas and energy-hungry desalination is becoming more widely used. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management. Land Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land-use change is fundamental to the operations of the biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can negatively impact both natural and human systems.

In temperate and boreal regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.Groombridge & Jenkins (2002). Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006). \\"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005: Progress Towards Sustainable Forest Management.\\" Forestry paper 147.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions). Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon- neutral fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.IPCC (2006).

Extinctions The extinct dodo (Raphus cucullatus) Although biodiversity loss can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Known as the Holocene extinction event this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the world's six mass extinction events. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.Wilson (2002)Leakey & Lewin (1995) Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42–47.

Biological invasions Kudzu (Pueraria lobata) infesting trees in Atlanta, Georgia, USA In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after climate change, has become the destructive effect of invasive species.Randall (2002). Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of organisms across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of globalization is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like HIV AIDS, mad cow disease, bird flu and swine flu, but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native biodiversity. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural predators, they are able to thrive.Krebs (2001) pp. 190–205. At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the Global Invasive Species Information Network but there is improved international biosecurity legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through CITES legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.Blood (2001). Resistance to change The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern environmental movement has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe ecological footprint overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the climate change problem.

He attended the Academie van Sint-Jans-Molenbeek from 1926, under Frans Persoons, where he was attracted equally by Realism (in the work of Eugène Laermans) and Surrealism (in Magritte's paintings). He developed his own style by combining these two schools, creating 'a kind of magic realism in which dream and reality, woman and nature, were intimately bound together'. Career He began work as an apprentice in a lithography studio and became a photo- engraver. He produced portraits, self-portraits, still life paintings and landscapes, and was a founding member of the Cercle Jecta in 1938 (Magritte was also a member). His work has been acquired by the Belgian state and by the province of Brabant, and he has given his name to a road in Jette and to a path in the Parc Baudouin.

He was described by The Guardian as the \\"legendary doyen of Nigerian journalism\\" and as \\"one of Nigeria's most significant media figures\\"; by The Independent as the \\"newspaper editor who dominated journalism in Nigeria for three decades\\" and as \\"the mighty tree whose seedlings sprouted other titans of the profession\\"; and by the British Broadcasting Corporation as \\"the grandfather of Nigerian journalism\\".\\"Nigeria: Still standing, but standing still\\", BBC, 23 September 2010 Early life and education Jose was born to the family of Hamzat and Hajarat Jose, his father was a trader, originally from Ikare in Ondo State, who had moved to Lagos, his mother was of Nupe ancestry.

P. 92 Babatunde Jose received his education at Lagos Government School, Yaba, Lagos, Methodist school, Yaba and St Saviour's College. Journalism career Jose started his career at Nnamdi Azikiwe's Daily Comet, before becoming a trainee at the Daily Times in 1941 at the age of 16. He was transferred to editorial department as a junior reporter in 1946 and then worked as a Times correspondent in the Eastern region and Northern region. In 1947, the Daily Mirror group bought majority shares in Daily Times. From 1948 to 1950, he was political and industrial correspondent of the Times and in 1950, he became the news editor.Daily Times of Nigeria Limited., & Namme, L. N. (1976).

P. 92 He worked for several papers (including the Daily Mirror in Fleet Street in London for a year in 1951), then returned to the Daily Times where he was made the assistant editor in 1952. On December 13, 1957, he was appointed the editor before becoming a board member in September 1958. Nigeria became independent in 1960, and Jose benefited from a policy of Africanisation: he \\"was appointed the company's first African managing director in 1962, becoming chairman as well in 1968\\". Over the following years, the Daily Times became Nigeria's best-selling newspaper. In 1965, he was awarded the title Officer of the Federal Republic. \\"[K]een on educated journalists,\\" Jose \\"went out of his way to set up a training school and to employ graduates\\". According to The Independent, he shaped his trainees and graduates \\"into irreverent reporters and columnists who could deflate the egos of the pompous politicians and military men who ruled the country\\", though he \\"eschewed partisan politics\\". One of his trainees, Segun Osoba, later Governor of Ogun State, said of him that he \\"encouraged intellectualism in Nigerian journalism\\" and \\"produced an array of highly successful journalists [...] many of whom have also gone on to establish their own newspapers and produce many other journalists\\". Following a coup in 1975 by General Murtala Mohammed, the Daily Times was forced to sell 60% of its shares to the government, and Jose was \\"eased out\\", departing a year later. The newspaper subsequently declined. From 1976 onwards, he pursued a career as \\"a businessman and media guru, holding such positions as chairman of the Nigerian Television Authority\\". He also served as \\"president of the Ahmadiyya Islamic movement and on many committees and industry organisations\\". Though he never graduated from a university, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by the University of Benin. \\"Unusually for a Muslim, he [also] received the Pope Pius medal for fostering religious understanding.\\" In 1987, he published his autobiography, Walking a Tight Rope.Babatunde Jose, Walking a Tight Rope, Ibadan : University Press, 1987, pp.421, References Nigerian newspaper journalists 1925 births 2008 deaths Yoruba journalists People from Lagos Nigerian Ahmadis Officers of the Order of the Niger Nigerian editors Nupe ","title":"Babatunde Jose"},{"id":"28966539","text":"Frances Blascoer was the NAACP's first Executive Secretary.

Its uplift in the Late Cretaceous marked the formation of the Wealden Anticline. The rock strata contain hydrocarbon deposits which have yielded coal, oil and gas. Formation Geologic map of southeast England and the region around the English Channel, showing the Weald-Artois anticline and therefore the modern day form of the Weald Basin in its regional context The Weald Basin's formation commenced during the Carboniferous, with the rocks which are today basement deposited within a low swamp providing coals which were exploited to the north and east in Kent, but boreholes drilled in the 19th century failed to find this deposit in the area of the Weald. The Carboniferous coals may be overlain by early Triassic sediments. The sediments were uplifted and faulted within the Variscan Orogeny, with the land now occupied by the Weald Basin being a low external fold belt to the main orogeny, which was located within the present day English Channel. The remnants of the mountain belt can be seen today in Devon and Cornwall in what is known as the Cornubian Massif. Unlike in Devon and Cornwall the deformation caused little or no metamorphism. The mountain belt collapsed soon after the orogeny, leading to the former northward thrusts to be reactivated as normal faults, and led to the formation of the Weald basin, which developed as an extension of the considerably larger Wessex Basin . Reconstructions of the geometry of the early fault systems in the Weald Basin reveal that for the early history of the basin a series of steep normal faults to the north were active against the London-Brabant Massif, but it is not clear whether this reflects a syn-rift origin for these rocks. The Weald basin gently subsided throughout the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Early Tertiary leading to a thick succession of sedimentary rocks being deposited. During the Early Jurassic a north and east shallowing mud-dominated shelf developed. Basin reactivation Geological section from north to south of the Wealden Anticline, note the unsymmetrical lower Cretaceous/Jurassic sediments in the core of the anticline. The diagram has undergone extensive vertical exaggeration As a result of the Alpine orogeny the basin was squeezed between the basement to the north and the south, this resulted in the reactivation of the formerly normal faults into minor thrusts (as they had been during the Variscan Orogeny) and the formation of the Wealden Anticline. The region's two surface structural highs (areas of crust and rocks which are uplifted), the Wealden Anticline and the Channel High, are superimposed upon earlier, Mesozoic basins, (the Weald and Channel basins). This nearly exact superimposition of compressional features upon underlying formerly extensional features exemplifies perfectly the principles of structural inversion across a large and well defined geologic feature. The overall uplift produced by the Tertiary inversion in the eastern Wealden basin has been estimated to be as much as 1525 m; which as a result of the large amount of Mesozoic sediments does not reveal the underlying Paleozoic basement. Utilising estimations of the original thickness of Chalk (400–460 m) and other Mesozoic strata indicate a complex fold structure which, in the event it was not eroded during uplift, attained a crestal elevation of 1400 m over what is today Ashdown Forest. However it is likely that erosion kept pace with uplift, resulting in large quantities of sediment supply to the North Sea and the English Channel Economic resources Coal seams were discovered when test boring for an early proposal for a Channel Tunnel at Dover in 1890. This led to the development of four deep mines in the Kent Coalfield in the early 20th century. The Weald Basin has yielded significant quantities of gypsum from Jurassic Purbeck beds and a number of brickworks exploit the lower Cretaceous clays. The inversion of the Weald Basin throughout the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary resulted in the formation of the Wealden Anticline and a number of smaller anticlines within the larger structure. The discovery in 1897 of natural gas while drilling for water at Heathfield railway station provided fuel for the first natural gas lighting in the United Kingdom. The existence of the same strata within the Weald basin which are the source rocks for the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset led to an interest in the petroleum potential of the Wealden anticline, with exploration taking place on Ashdown forest examining the Ashdown Anticline, a large structure over 30 km long x 7 km wide, located in the centre of the Weald Basin in north Sussex; significant quantities of natural gas were found but oil was absent. Oil and gas have subsequently been found at a number of sites in the Weald including Singleton and Storrington in West Sussex, Godstone and Lingfied in Surrey, and Cowden in Kent. In 2009 remaining recoverable oil reserves in the Weald Basin were estimated at one and a half million tonnes. In 2010 the Weald Basin contributed 18% of onshore gas and less than 5% of onshore oil production in the UK. As of August 2013 there was significant opposition to hydraulic fracturing developing in southeast England centred on Balcombe where an exploratory well was planned and the Balcombe drilling protest was in progress. A BGS/Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) report from May 2014 suggest that there is the possibility for the extraction of light tight oil (LTO) in Weald Basin and the average figure of is suggested. The overall range of estimations is from . The data is said to have a \\"high degree of uncertainty\\", and the amount that could be produced is unknown, and could be zero.

He was also an author, painter, musician, and an architect. Early life and career Lee was born in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, to James Lee and Catharine Shriner. As a youth, he studied art in Philadelphia, supposedly under Thomas Sully. On October 3, 1838, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th United States Infantry Regiment, mostly through the influence of Simon Cameron. Less than a month later, on November 1, he was transferred to the 8th United States Infantry Regiment. He assisted in the 1840 removal of Winnebago Indians from Wisconsin and later participated in the Seminole War. While in Florida, he would meet Margaret Wenthworth Spafford, whom he would marry on July 27, 1844, at St. Augustine. They would have five children, only one of which would survive childhood. Mexican–American War On March 4, 1845, Lee was promoted to 1st lieutenant. His unit was transferred to Texas in September of that year and placed under General Zachary Taylor. At the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, he commanded a company of the regiment, serving alongside 1st Lieutenant James Longstreet.Wilcox, Cadmus Marcellus. History of the Mexican War. Church News Pub. Co, 1892. pg. 639 He would write a poem about both of these battles.Lee, Arthur Tracy. Army Ballads, and Other Poems. 1871. Other assignments In September 1846, Lee was dispatched to Rochester, New York, to act as a recruiter. During this time, on January 27, 1848, he was promoted to captain. He finished his recruiting duty that July and in the fall, he helped with the removal of Winnebago Indians in Minnesota. Late that year, he returned to Texas and his command of Company C. In October 1849, Lee, along with his company, moved to Fort Croghan to protect white settlers who were intruding on Indian territory. Four different times, from 1849 to 1851, he would server as the commander here.Goble, Carole A. Burnet, Texas (Images of America Series). Arcadia Publishing, 2009. pg. 14. His company, along with four other companies of the 8th US Infantry, established Fort McKavett in 1852, to protect west Texas settlers and to act as a rest-stop for California- bound immigrants. During his command here, he had daily contact with southern Comanches, including Buffalo Hump, Yellow Wolf, Ketumsee, and Sanaco. Lee would write on May 15, 1852, \\"I have upon all occasions found them to be friendly & well disposed towards the whites, provided they were supplied with food necessary to sustain life.\\"Anderson, Gary Clayton. The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820–1875. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Publishing Division of the University, 2005. pg. 249. Lee and his regiment were also dispatched to other camps, including Fort Martin Scott, Fort Worth, Fort Mason, and Fort Chadbourne. The 8th US Infantry was ordered in October 1854 to establish a fort in the Davis Mountains, which was further west, entering Apache territory. During his four years at Fort Davis, he spent time sketching and watercoloring. There are 154 known paintings, depicting much of what he saw during his service. When September 1858 came around, Lee, who was in command of two companies, was ordered 120 miles further west, to establish Fort Quitman. A year later, he was ordered to Fort Brown to help with the Cortina War. He did not arrive until after the skirmishes had ceased, so he did not see any military action. Lee was next assigned to Fort Stockton. Civil War While at Fort Stockton, Lee learned of the secession of Texas from the Union. With his company, he began marching towards the coast in an attempt to get his men out of the state. On April 21, 1861, they were captured in San Antonio by Confederate forces. He was arrested and then paroled under the condition that he not take up arms against the Confederate government or give information against Confederate interests unless \\"regularly engaged.\\" Gettysburg, July 2. On October 26, 1861, he was appointed as major of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Complying with his parole terms, he spent much of his time doing various assignments in the North, but when his parole expired, he joined his regiment in time to command them at the battle of Gettysburg. =Gettysburg= On July 2, 1863, at 3:30 am, Lee advanced his regiment towards Gettysburg, which was five miles away. When they were about 1½ miles southeast of the town, twenty men were pushed forward as skirmishers to probe enemy pickets, which could be seen beyond a body of woods. After skirmishing for about 2 hours and suffering light casualties, they were withdrawn and marched two miles to the left rear, where they would rest. Around 5:00 pm, Lee was ordered to join the fighting at the Wheatfield, forming the right of Colonel Sidney Burbank's brigade. Traveling through Plum Run to reach their objective, they came upon a marshy area, that at places, was ankle-deep in mud. Confederate sharpshooters from the left, right, and front began firing upon the regiment. After ordering his unit to double-quick, Lee was able to force the sharpshooters back, driving them from the edge of the Rose Woods on Houck's Ridge. He came upon a stone wall at the edge of the Wheatfield and his unit was ordered to halt, taking cover behind the wall. Due to the attack being made my Colonel Jacob Sweitzer's brigade, Colonel Burbank could not advance his brigade, as the attack was being made perpendicular to their current position, with the enemy to the left. When Sweitzer's brigade had retired, Lee was ordered to advance. After having his unit jump over the stone wall, they began to make a left wheel. Halfway into the wheel, Lee noticed the Confederates moving quickly to the right, in hopes of outflanking his regiment. Ordering his regiment to halt, firing was commenced and the enemy returned fire.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies: Series I. Vol. 27. Part I. Reports. Serial No. 43. Lee was subsequently wounded in the right ankle and hip as a result. After some severe fighting, a fresh column of Confederate infantry appeared on the right and Lee was ordered to withdraw his regiment. As soon as they started withdrawing, three lines of infantry, elevated one line above each other to their right, opened fire. The color- staff was cut in half, causing the colors to fall into the hands of the color- bearer. They retired slowly to the woods, stone wall, and then the marsh, all while under fire from sharpshooters on the left at Devil's Den and from the columns of infantry to the right. Returning to his battle line, Lee transferred command of the regiment to Captain Samuel A. McKee, under advice from the surgeon. Due to the seriousness of his wounds, Lee would not return to active duty. However, for his actions that day, he was brevetted to lieutenant colonel. On January 20, 1865, he retired from active duty. Postbellum Lee would receive a retroactive promotion to colonel on July 28, 1866, for years of service in the United States Army. From 1867 through 1872, he would serve as the governor of the Old Soldier's Home in Washington, D.C. In 1871, two of his literary works, Army Ballads, and Other Poems and \\"Reminiscences of the Regiment,\\" which was featured in the History of the Eighth U.S. Infantry, were published. In 1872, after giving up his position as governor, he moved to Rochester, New York, with Margaret. He continued painting, spending his summers at Shelter Island. On December 29, 1879, Lee died at his home and was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester.

It is located about east of Jimma in Wolaita/Dawro Region. The power station receives water from a tunnel entrance on the Gilgel Gibe River. It has an installed capacity of 420 MW and was inaugurated on January 14, 2010. Almost two weeks after inauguration, a portion of the head race tunnel collapsed causing the station to shut down. Repairs were completed on December 26, 2010. Design The Gilgel Gibe II consists of a power station on the Omo River that is fed with water from a headrace tunnel and sluice gate on the Gilgel Gibe River. The headrace tunnel runs under the Fofa Mountain and at its end, it converts into a penstock with a drop. When the water reaches the power station, it powers four Pelton turbines that operate four 107 MW generators. Each turbine is in diameter. Construction Construction on the power plant began on March 19, 2005, with Salini Costruttori as the main contractor. The power station was originally slated to be complete in late 2007 but was delayed because engineering problems encountered during construction. In March 2005, the contract to excavate the tunnel was awarded to SELI and in October 2006, a tunnel boring machine (TBM) hit a fault, delaying the project. On June 9, 2009, both TBMs met each other and the tunnel was ready for hydraulic testing that September. The tunnel is \\"considered one of the most difficult tunnel projects ever undertaken, due to the critical, and in some reaches, exceptionally adverse, ground conditions.\\" The power station was inaugurated on January 14, 2010. =Tunnel collapse and repair= About ten days after the project was completed, about of the headrace tunnel collapsed. The collapse may have been attributed it to structural failure caused by expedited construction and a lack of proper studies.International Rivers: Ethiopian Dam Suffers Tunnel Collapse Days After Inauguration Published 5 February 2010. Accessed 13 June 2010. The official statement of the construction firm Salini Costruttori, released two weeks after the official inauguration was that \\"an unforeseen geological event provoked a 'cave in' and a huge rock fall involving about 15m of the 26km headrace tunnel.\\"Tunnel Talk Collapse of Headrace Tunnel After Grand Opening Published February 2010. Accessed 13 June 2010. The tunnel was repaired and the station operational again on December 26, 2010. Financing In 2004, the Government of Ethiopia secured €220 million from the Government of Italy for construction. The total cost of construction is €373 million with €50 million provided by the European Investment Bank, and the remaining €103 million from the Ethiopian Government. Controversy The financing of the power plant was controversial within the Italian government. It was granted despite objections raised by the Directorate General for Development Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy and Finance. They argued against the loan because the contract was awarded without competitive bidding in breach of Italian law, because its unusually large size meant that less funding was available for other development projects, no costs for environmental impact assessment of monitoring were included, the project was not commercially viable due to low electricity tariffs in Ethiopia and because it was inappropriate to burden such a poor country with more debt at a time when it had just received debt relief from Italy. There were also parliamentary questions concerning the project which were left unanswered by the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Mantica. In March 2006 the Prosecutors’ Office in Rome instigated criminal proceedings concerning the Gilgel Gibe II hydroelectric project.

It could be mistaken for or erroneously referred to as harlequin bug. It is native to Africa. It is known elsewhere as an introduced species, including California and Arizona, where it was first reported in 2008.Center for Invasive Species Research - UC Riverside It is a major pest insect of Brassica oleracea crops (including cabbage, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli), and related crucifers such as turnips, rape, and mustard. The adult and nymph of the species suck sap from the leaves of the plants, causing wilting, yellowing, and stunting of growth. Besides crucifers, the bugs are known on papaya, sorghum, maize, potato, cotton, caper, pearl millet, and some legumes. Large numbers of the bug congregate on the plants and cause extensive damage. Several stages of Bagrada hilaris, Los Angeles 2010 The adult bug is 5 to 7 millimeters in length, shield-shaped, and black with white and orange markings. The female, which is larger than the male, lays up to 100 oval or barrel-shaped eggs on leaves or in soil beneath plants. The eggs are white when freshly deposited and turn orange over time. Within 8 days the first- instar nymph emerges. It is bright orange-red and turns darker as it develops, becoming black by the last instar. The bug made a sudden appearance in Los Angeles in June, 2008, its first sighting in the Western Hemisphere. It then moved into the cropland of the heavily agricultural Coachella and Imperial Valleys of California, doing damage to cole crops there, especially those grown organically.Blake, C.

I. elba has thus been identified as a potential control agent for B. hilaris, which may benefit the broccoli crops that B. hilaris infests.

The original name of the school was \\"Wuxi Private Furen Middle School\\", the preparatory school of Saint John's University in Shanghai. The name Furen (lit. \\"Helping Charity\\") is from The Analects of Confucius – Yanyuan :- \\"meeting friends with articles, helping charity with friends\\" (). The motto is \\"Realizing Ethics, Enhancing Virtue\\". The original location was the east gate of Wuxi old city. Now the school has moved to Yinxiu road, Lihu new district, west of Wuxi. History =Founding= On 31 July 1918, the Shanghai Saint John's University Wuxi alumni association member Tang Jiyun and Yang Sijian suggested to set up a private preparatory school for the university. The association was able to collect 4,000 silver taels to set it up. It opened on 14 September 1918. The first principal was an American missionary, Mu Gaowen() from Episcopal Church in the United States of America. At first, the school rented JP Liu's house on Shuyuan Lane. After more students entered the school, in 1924, the school built 50 dormitories near Jiangjun bridge, Sujia lane, the east part of Wuxi city. The school was considered the most advanced middle school in the region with modern physics and chemistry laboratories, and amphitheaters. =Shanghai campus= During Sino-Japanese War, the school was forced to move to Shanghai Concession and rent part houses of Cishu mansion near Shandong road and Nanjing road. After the war is over, school returned to Wuxi. =Donglin campus= After People's Republic of China was founded, in 1953, school's ownership was altered from private, to public, and the school name changed to \\"Wuxi No.2 Middle School\\" (abbr. Wuxi 2nd School). Some elite teachers were dismissed from the school and were ordered to found the Wuxi No.1 High School near the Grand Canal of Wuxi. In January 1971, the second Middle School combined \\"Donglin primary school\\" and changed the school's name to \\"Donglin School\\". In 1982, they separated again, and the middle school was confirmed as one of the key provincial middle schools. =Qinyuan campus= On 11 March 1992, to expand from original 12 acres campus area, the school moved to Qinyuan area in the southern suburb. New school occupied 65 acres. In 1994 it changed from middle school to high school. In 1998 it passed national key- school acceptance check. In February 2003, Wuxi government approved Wuxi No.2 High School, Wuxi No.2 Experimental Campus, and Wuxi Furen Private Middle School form up one \\"Furen Education Corp.\\" The Wuxi No.2 Middle School changed back to its old name \\"Wuxi Furen High School\\". In 2004 school was selected as first batch of 4-Star high school. =Lihu campus= In 2007 decision was made by education bureau to move the school again, to newly built Lihu new city near the Yinxiu road and Hubin road, the original site of Taide International School. On 16 August 2008 new campus started to build. On 15 July 2009, the senior grades moved to new address in Lihu campus, while the junior grades remain in Qinyuan campus. 。 Campus Nowadays the newest campus has 158 acres with building area more than 80,000 square meters.

Turnbull has been providing technical assistance in the development of the Hulme F1.Bruce Turnbull, retrieved 8 January 2016 Since 2002 Sakers are being built and designed in Etten-Leur, Netherlands by Saker Sportscars B.V. Models The Saker SV1 was the first model of the car, entering limited production in 1992. The car was road legal and regularly used for touring and competition. The SV1 was designed to be powered by a variety of engines, including V8 and V6. They were sold in the UK, Japan and New Zealand. In 1999 Turnbull introduced the Saker SVS GT and SVS Sprint. The Sprint was an open-top version. These model features updated chassis and mechanics. The main changes were to the space- frame chassis, which was stretched by about to allow it to accept a wider range of engines. The most common engine used was the Subaru Impreza WRX turbo flat-four with a converted transaxle for rear-wheel-drive, although Subaru flat-sixes could also be fitted. Both the GT and Sprint were manufactured in the Netherlands, though there was a dispute over the licensing. A small number, as few as three, of race-only Saker GTs were also manufactured under license in the USA. One road-going Saker SVS was imported from New Zealand into the US in 2004. It was fitted with a Lexus 1UZ-FE 4.0-liter V8 engine mated to a Renault UN1 5-speed Transaxle. Since then it has been modified to accept a highly tuned Chevy LS6 5.7L V8, that produces almost 500bhp, mated to an Audi 01E (DQS variant) 6-speed transaxle. At the time of the engine change the owner also modified the body, headlights, tail lights, and front bumper/splitter to make the car look more modern. Netherlands Amsterdam International Motor Show RapX and Sniper In 2002 Huub Vermeulen (DNRT) and Robbert Visser were wanting to make an affordable racing car. Bruce Turnbull's Saker appeared to meet that need. The rights to manufacture the cars were purchased and Saker Sportscars was founded in the Netherlands. The company is now run by Herbert Boender with the support of the Meyer brothers, Laurens and Gerrit. Both the Saker GT and Sprint are still made by Saker Sportscars. In 2010 two new versions were added to the range, the RapX and the Sniper. However, the specifications remain the same as the GT and Sprint with only the bodywork changing. =Sports car racing= GT racing A Saker RAPX competing in the Britcar Endurance Championship A Saker RAPX's engine The Saker Sportscar Challenge was founded in 2004 allowing Saker drivers to compete against each other under the banner of the DNRT. The Saker Sportscar Challenge was one of the top of amateur racing classes in the Netherlands. The series races were held at Circuit Park Zandvoort, TT Circuit Assen, Spa-Francorchamps and Brands Hatch. The final race of the season took place in late October at Circuit Park Zandvoort. Judging by the series' website, the last full season of the Saker Challenge was 2013. Alan Purbrick and David Brise have competed in the Britcar Endurance Championship driving a Saker RAPX for three years, achieving a race victory at the end of the 2018 season. Along with the Saker Sportscar Challenge, Sakers also compete elsewhere. Sakers have raced for several years in the 24 Hours of Dubai and achieved a class victory in the 24 Hours of Barcelona.

Radyne, like the similarly conceived Kasperk, represents the height of the 14th-century trend towards the merging of castle buildings. History When the castle of Starý Plzenec fell into disrepair in the first half of the 13th century, it was necessary to build a new centre of royal power for the administration of the region of Plzeň. Construction apparently began in 1353, during the rule of Charles IV, and was completed in 1361. The original name of Karlskrone (Charles' Crown) did not become commonly used in the district, and the castle gradually took the name of the hill on which it was built - Radyně. The burgraves who governed the region were based in Radyně, and by the end of the 15th century it had been acquired by the Šternberks (1496–1561),Ehrenberger, Tomaš (2003), The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, Kartografie Praha a.s., pg. 118. who settled at the more comfortable castle at Bechyně. Its counterpart at Radyně, which was accessible only with difficulty, started to fall into disrepair, and its fate was sealed in the first quarter of the 16th century when it was burned down. As early as 1558, record indicated that it was abandoned, and not even the affluent Černín of the Crudenice family, owners of the castle as well as the surrounding district in the 18th century, invested in repair work. The mysterious abandoned ruin had to wait until the coming of the Romantic movement in the 19th century for more interest to be shown in it. Minor repairs and alterations were however destroyed by fire in 1886. In recent years, the castle has been progressively renovated, and a permanent exhibition devoted to its history can now be seen. The tower is open to visitors of the castle, and its observation point affords wonderful views.

The Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Agony in Vitinia (, ) is a Roman Catholic titular church in Rome, built as a parish church by decree of Cardinal Clemente Micara. On 30 April 1969 Pope Paul VI granted it a titular church as a seat for Cardinals.Cardinal Title S. Cuore di Gesù agonizzante a Vitinia GCatholic.org The present Cardinal Priest of the Titulus San Athanasii ad viam Tiburtinam is Telesphore Placidus Toppo. The actual suburb is called Vitinia, the first one westwards on the Via del Mare after the Circonvallazione Meridionale. The cardinalate title, created in 1969, is Sacro Cuore di Gesù Agonizzante a Vitinia, and the present titular is Telesphore Placidus Toppo. The dedication is to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Agony. It was designed by Ildo Avetta, and opened in 1955. The floor plan is basically rectangular with a shallowly curved apse, but the shape of the building is complex. The entrance façade is dominated by a white parabola, decorated with four rows of unusually shaped windows resembling stretched animal skins arranged vertically (the four curves making up each shape are also parabolic). These windows increase in overall size and proportional length from top row to bottom, and the rows number two, three, four and five. The parabola is bounded by two pink brick walls which slope backwards from the two corners of the overall façade, creating voids either side of the parabola, and it also has a floating canopy either side of its apex covering these voids. The side walls of the church are strongly zig-zag, with six triangular projections running from ground to roof on each side in the same pink brick, with small square windows inserted into the otherwise blank wall in an array shaped like a parallelogram on each of the overall twenty-four faces of this arrangement. The roof has a shallow downward curve on either side of the major axis, over these projections, and over the nave is shaped as a result like a row of six and a half lozenges (the half is the canopy over the entrance parabola). At the altar end, the roof forms an irregular hexagon stretched transversely and with the angle behind the altar smoothed away by the apse curve. The walls here are all blank brick, but the roof forms three shallow parabolas, a large one over the apse and two smaller ones on the shorter side faces of the hexagon. These three voids are filled by stained glass. There is a detached campanile to the right of the altar end. It is an octagonal brick tower, with small square windows inserted in one vertical row on each face. The bellchamber is of concrete, formed of eight parabolic arches.

History =Trams to Bondi= Terraced houses, Bondi Junction Bondi Road was once serviced by electric trams. From 1902 to 1960, services to Bondi, Bondi Beach and North Bondi ran via Bondi Road or Bellevue Hill. Services from the CBD commenced at Circular Quay (via Bridge and Elizabeth Sts) or Railway Square (via Elizabeth and Liverpool Sts). From Oxford St, the line travelled through to Bondi Junction, where it joined Bondi Road. On the descent to Bondi Beach, trams entered Campbell Parade via an under pass at a point where Bondi Road was too steep, first by turning right into Denham Street, then left into Fletcher Street and Rowland Avenue, where the under pass was once locatedhttp://www.geared.com.au/cgi- bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id;=4310595 (now developed into apartments at 331a Bondi Road).Gregory's Street directory, 1955, page 20, ref B5 A feature of this line was the large three-track terminus cut into a hillside at North Bondi, which opened in 1946.

He served as the foreign minister of Egypt from 2001 to 2004. Early life and education Maher was born in Cairo on 14 September 1935. He came from a family of diplomats and politicians. He was the brother of Ambassador Ali Maher and their grandfather, Ahmad Mahir Pasha, was one of the prime ministers of Egypt. He studied law at Cairo University and graduated in 1956. Career After graduation Maher joined the foreign ministry in 1957, serving as a junior diplomat in Switzerland (9 February 1959 - 31 August 1963), Congo (5 May 1967 - 24 May 1971) and France (8 August 1974 - 30 September 1977). In addition, he was the national security advisor to the president of Egypt from 1971 to 1974. Next he was named as the head of the foreign minister’s staff.from 1978 to 1980. He was part of the Camp David talks in 1978, where he was assigned to coordinate efforts with the then US secretary of state Cyrus Vance. He also took part in the 1988 talks, leading to the return of Taba to Egyptian control after Israel occupied the town in 1967. Generally considered an outsider in Egyptian politics, Maher had a distinguished career as a diplomat. Most notably, he was ambassador to the Soviet Union (1 October 1988 - 19 June 1992) as well as ambassador to Portugal (5 September 1980 - 8 November 1982) and Belgium (8 November 1982 - 9 December 1984). In addition, he served as the ambassador in Washington for seven years from 7 July 1992 to 14 September 1999. He retired from office in 1999. After retirement, he was named as the director of the Special Arab Aid Fund for Africa (SAAFA) in Cairo, a body of the Arab League, in 2000. He was appointed foreign minister on 15 May 2001, being the 71st figure in the post. He succeeded Amr Moussa as foreign minister after Moussa was appointed head of the Arab League. When he was in office many significant events in regard to the Arab world occurred, including the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During a visit to Israel as part of Egyptian efforts to relaunch the peace process, Maher was attacked by Palestinian activists in the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in east Jerusalem in December 2003. The Palestinians booed and hurled shoes at him in protest at Egypt's perceived policy of appeasement towards Israel. His term ended in 2004 and Ahmed Aboul Gheit replaced him in the post. In July 2010, Hosni Mobarak appointed him a member of the parliament's upper house, or Shura Council. Death Maher died of a heart attack on 27 September 2010 at the age of 75.

It was discovered as an unstable gas and only in 2009 found to be a stable ligand combining with transition metals, in the same way as carbon monoxide. It is a subhalide, containing fewer than the normal number of fluorine atoms, compared with boron trifluoride. It can also be called a borylene, as it contains boron with two unshared electrons. BF is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide and dinitrogen; each molecule has 14 electrons. Structure The experimental B-F bond length is 1.26267 Å. Despite being isoelectronic to the triple-bonded species CO and N2, computational studies generally agree that the true bond order is much lower than 3. One reported computed bond order for the molecule is 1.4, compared with 2.6 for CO and 3.0 for N2. Lewis dot diagram structures show three formal alternatives for describing bonding in boron monofluoride. BF is unusual in that the dipole moment is inverted with fluorine having a positive charge even though it is the more electronegative element. This is explained by the 2sp orbitals of boron being reoriented and having a higher electron density. Backbonding, or the transfer of π orbital electrons for the fluorine atom, is not required to explain the polarization. Preparation Boron monofluoride can be prepared by passing boron trifluoride gas at 2000 °C over a boron rod. It can be condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (−196 °C). Properties Boron monofluoride molecules have a dissociation energy of 7.8 eV or heat of formation −27.5±3 kcal/mole 760 kJ/mol. The first ionization potential is 11.115 eV. ωe is 1765 cm−1. Reactions BF can react with itself to form polymers of boron containing fluorine with between 10 and 14 boron atoms. BF reacts with BF3 to form B2F4. BF and B2F4 further combine to form B3F5. B3F5 is unstable above −50 °C and forms B8F12. This substance is a yellow oil. BF reacts with acetylenes to make the 1,4-diboracyclohexadiene ring system. BF can condense with 2-butyne forming 1,4-difluoro-2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-diboracyclohexadiene. Also, it reacts with acetylene to make 1,4-difluoro-1,4-diboracyclohexadiene. Propene reacts to make a mix of cyclic and non-cyclic molecules which may contain BF or BF2. BF hardly reacts with C2F4 or SiF4. BF does react with arsine, carbon monoxide, phosphorus trifluoride, phosphine, and phosphorus trichloride to make adducts like (BF2)3B•AsH3, (BF2)3B•CO, (BF2)3B•PF3, (BF2)3B•PH3, and (BF2)3B•PCl3. BF reacts with oxygen: BF + O2 → OBF + O; with chlorine: BF + Cl2 → ClBF + Cl; and with nitrogen dioxide BF + NO2 → OBF + NO. Ligand The first case of BF being a ligand on a transition element was demonstrated in 2009 with the compound (C5H5)2Ru2(CO)4(μ-BF). The BF was bound to both ruthenium atoms as a bridge. Vidovic and Aldridge reacted NaRu(CO)2(C5H5) with (Et2O)·BF3. Note that the BF was formed in place rather than added on. Earlier in 1968, K. Kämpfer, H. Nöth, W. Petz, and G. Schmid claimed that Fe(BF)(CO)4 was formed in the reaction of B2F4 with Fe(CO)5, however this has not been reproduced. By reacting iron vapour with B2F4 and PF3, a substance with the formula (PF3)4FeBF was produced. Hafnium, thorium, titanium, and zirconium can form a difluoride with a BF ligand at the low temperature of 6K. These come about by reacting the atomic metal with BF3. The first fully characterized molecule featuring BF as a terminal ligand was synthesized by Drance and Figueroa in 2019. BF is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and so could form similar compounds to metal carbonyls. It is predicted to also bridge between two or three metal atoms (μ2 and μ3). Working with BF as a ligand is difficult due to its instability in the free state.

Plot After the Bosnian War, Bosnia and Herzegovina is occupied by the NATO-led (IFOR) Implementation Force. In February 1996, a unit of Polish IFOR troops detains and releases three foreign mercenaries in Srebrenica, before they can be executed by a Bosnian mob. The Polish unit is led by Major Edward \\"Edek\\" Keller (Bogusław Linda). Soon later, Keller is under investigation for insubordination and for clashes with the Bosnian militia and foreign mercenaries. The investigation is led by two arriving officers - Lieutenant Czacki (Olaf Lubaszenko) and Major Czesław Kusz (Tadeusz Huk), who will replace Keller as the commanding officer of the battalion on 1 March. The investigation comes at a sensitive time for Polish forces, as the Polish government tries to become a member of NATO. Keller maintains command of the unit, until his commission ends. Upon Czacki and Kusz's arrival, the unit receives a distress call from a downed Norwegian helicopter. Keller assembles his unit for a search and rescue mission to the downed chopper. However, his mission is rejected by the IFOR command. Despite the order, Keller ignores it and goes on with the mission. After locating the helicopter, members of the crew are found dead. Keller and the unit goes after the militia that killed the helicopter crew. The unit manages to locate a group of twenty Bosnian militia fighters, that are led by Skija (Slobodan Custic), a foreign mercenary. The militia is also holding two captives, a young French female journalist named Nicol (Aleksandra Niespielak) and a male Bosnian press representative named Dano Ivanov (Denis Delic). Keller, himself, manages to stealthily kill one of the militiamen and rescue the captives. The unit then heads for a helicopter extraction, while the militia discovers that someone killed one of their fighters. Skija sends his men to hunt them down and locate an important missing videotape, that was held by Ivanov. During extraction, the unit's helicopter is shot down before landing. Immediately, the unit is ambushed by the militia and several troops are wounded. The unit manages to eliminate some of the fighters and break out. After the engagement, some of the Polish soldiers argue with Keller that they are just a peacekeeping force and wish not to fight. However, Keller manages to keep them in line. The unit continues on foot and then establishes camp at a farm. There, Keller and the unit discover that Ivanov was in possession of videotape that the militia is trying to acquire. According to Nicol, the tape shows a mass execution of a Bosnian village ordered by the Bosnian Prime Minister. The next morning, Ivanov kills one of Keller's soldiers and escapes the camp. As the unit heads for their base, they are ambushed yet again by the militia and Keller is forced to give up the important videotape. Keller and his unit are spared by the militia, and then go after Skija and the militia, who are trying to burn down the Gypsy village where Keller and his unit had established camp earlier. Keller and his unit attack the militia at the village. Keller eventually confronts Skija and it is revealed that Ivanov promised to bribe one of Keller's officers for the videotape. Keller then kills Skija after being saved by Kusz. After arriving at the base, the cost and pain of warfare takes a toll on the unit. It is also revealed that the unit retrieved the videotape, and Ivanov was actually in possession of a Polish pornography tape. Keller is then relieved of his command, and Kusz takes control of the Polish battalion. Before heading back to Poland, Keller gives the tape to the French journalist Nicol. The film closes with Keller sitting on the plane with several coffins of dead soldiers from his unit.

The history of engine production  USSR moped « Riga-1», Riga motorcycle factory (1961-1965) Riga-4 moped (1970-1974) In the 1960s, the idea of providing people of the Soviet Union with an easy to use, easy to maintain, motorised transport took form. The idea was followed by action and a plan was formed at Riga Engine Factory \\"Sarkanā zvaigzne\\". Initially, the Hungarian Dongó, bicycle-mounted auxiliary engine and the Velosolex motorcycle was tested, but these vehicles did not bring the expected success, so they turned their attention toward light motorcycles as they had proved popular in the West.  Types  In 1965 the first model, called Riga-1, was released. The frame and look was inspired by the East German Simson Suhl. The engine was an imported Czechoslovakian made Jawa Stadion S11/S22 engine. It used a two speed gearbox and foot pedals could also be used. Later production of the engine was brought in-house. In 1967 the successor, Riga-3, was presented at the Budapest International Fair. It was not much different from its predecessor, however, some changes were done to be able to use the S-51 engine. It was a 49.8 cc, air cooled, 1.5 HP engine using carburetor, mostly of type K30 or K35. It had 19\\" wheels and skirted fenders. In 1969 a more streamlined version, Riga-4, was introduced. The design of the engine had undergone numerous changes. The large-diameter, 19-inch wheels were replaced by smaller, 16-inch wheels, which remained until the end of the Riga moped production. The fuel tank was replaced. The new engine, S-52, was a 2 to 2.2 hp engine. In the last production year the all-plastic tail light cover from the previous design was replaced by metal. In 1974 the Riga-12 was released. It had significantly changed its appearance and functioning. While the earlier models had a rounded fuel tank it was now replaced by a less flashy, rounded off, rectangular shape. It still maintained its pedal-crank functionality. In 1979 Riga-16 was released. It essentially looked like the Riga-12. The engine was now a S-58, and pedal-cranks were not used in the design. The exhaust system had also changed; it was much longer. The seat was the long type, and more comfortable. The rear lamps were changed to a larger hexagonal-shape. It also came in metallic paint. 1981 the Riga-22 was released. At first it had a Š-62 engine, then starting from 1984 Riga-22 was equipped with a V-50 engine. First V-50 models had no external differences from the Š-62, but the internals were redesigned. It had a similar looking, but, better clutch. The only identical parts were plastic friction discs. Instead of 2 friction discs, the V-50 had 3 friction discs, and the gearbox in V-50 had ball bearings, instead of plain bearings. It had a new, and more modern electronic ignition, and the fuel tank was redesigned. The new V-50 engine was also used. Riga-22 was produced until 1989. \\"Rīga-18\\" mokik experimental 1978 1986 was a turn-around year for Riga. Deteriorating quality and engine problems made the need of a new model apparent. So in 1986 the new Riga Delta was introduced. The engine is in no way resembles its predecessor. The frame is completely changed. It has a new fuel tank, with only \\"Delta\\" written on it. Replaced the front and rear lamps and ignition. The Deltas were available in three colours pea-green, brick red and beige. Deltas also featured 3 gear gearbox. In 1986 the Mini Riga was introduced. It was a mini moped using the V-50 and later V-501 engines. In the early 1990s the engine was changed to the well-known Jawa 210 Babette's two- speed, automatic transmission engine.

It has woolly, star-shaped hairs on its young branches, variably-shaped leaves covered with brownish or whitish hairs on the underside, and yellow flowers with woolly brown, star-shaped hairs on the back. Description Asterolasia asteriscophora is a slender, erect shrub that typically grows to a height of with its young branches covered with woolly, grey to brown star-shaped hairs. The leaves are spatula-shaped, egg- shaped, wedge-shaped or elliptic, long and wide on a short petiole. The upper surface of the leaves is more or less glabrous and the lower surface is covered with woolly, brownish or whitish hairs. The flowers are arranged singly or in small groups in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets on pedicels long. The petals are yellow, rarely white, long and covered with woolly brown star-shaped hairs on the back. Flowering occurs in spring. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1855 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Phebalium asteriscophora and published the description in Transactions and Proceedings of the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science. In 1917 George Claridge Druce changed the name to Asterolasia asteriscophora. In 2002, Bryan J. Mole described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Asterolasia asteriscophora subsp. albiflora that has white, rarely pale lemon-coloured petals with smaller leaves and flowers that the autonym; * Asterolasia asteriscophora subsp. asteriscophora that has bright yellow petals up to long and leaves mostly longer than . Distribution and habitat Asterolasia asteriscophora is widely distributed along the Great Dividing Range from the Tumut district in New South Wales to the Macedon and Emerald districts in Victoria. It grows in forest and along the eges of watercourses. Subspecies albiflora is only known from the Emerald-Avonsleigh and is threatened by urban development.

Armorial Families: A Directory of Gentlemen of Coat-Armour (Volume 2) She won the 1916 Melrose prize for her debut novel Unhappy in Thy Daring. Set in Ireland, it tells of a husband and wife's growing estrangement which is being nurtured by the wife's sister. H. G. Wells, one of the competition adjudicators, said of it: \\"The book has real strength and a remarkable sense of character. Power of imagination and originality; the writer has borrowed from no one.\\" Her book met with mixed reviews. A reviewer in The Bookman praised the novel for its realism but found it vulgar. \\"Here is your risky and almost fatal experiment of marriage, your linking of unequal natures, your development of the inevitable triangle, your cool but ruthlessly explicit presentment of sex in action. No blinking facts for us, or sentimentalising them: this is how men and women are made, and the only way we can get ahead is to admit it! . . . There are passages which violate,I do not say morals, but taste: they present ignoble things in a vulgar way.\\"H.W. Boynton, Some Stories of the Month, The Bookman, February 1917 pp. 644–649 One reviewer felt the work had merits but was uneven. \\"It is a strange production, with all the signs of a first novel except an autobiographical strain. The title has practically no connection with the story, and the author's name is from the third page a transparent pretence, for the whole style is feminine! The story reflects the mournful side of the Irish character.\\"A Prize Novel, The Register (Adelaide SA), Saturday 15 July 1916 Another contemporary review commented: \\"Her sense of character is remarkable—likewise distorted—and the book leaves one with a nasty taste in the mouth. . . . the doings of Rupert Standish surely stand out as among the most despicable ever imagined by a young author.\\"Review in The Queenslander (Brisbane, Qld. 8 July 1916 A New Zealand review concurred: \\"The husband is a pitifully weak, indeed quite contemptible character, and however a woman like Shelagh Lynch could have married—and forgiven—such a man passes my comprehension. Some of the minor characters, however, are more pleasing creations and the author’s style is so fresh and attractive that his (or her) future works will be looked forward to with pleasurable anticipation.Some Recent Fiction, “A Prize Novel”, Dominion, Rōrahi 9, Putanga 2836, 29 Hōngongoi 1916, p. 6 A review in The Nation and Athenaeum was critical of her handling of psychology, commenting: “'Marius Lyle's' workmanship is too lazy and slipshod to carry out its adventurous and difficult task\\".The Nation and Athenæum, 1916, Vol.19, p. 142 Marius Lyle's second novel was Sins of the Mothers (Andrew Melrose, London, 1918). A review in The Spectator states: \\"This novel chiefly deals with the mental procurement of a family of children who are left motherless—though by no means fatherless.The clash of temperaments inherited respectively from the father and mother is the chief motive of the book.\\"The Spectator, Issues 4671–4696, 1918, p. 126 In his review, Stopford Brooke wrote: \\". . . \\"Unhappy in Thy Daring\\" has gone on selling steadily, and finding its way into all corners of the British Empire and India. The new book is again a psychological study of temperament, of passion, and of tragedy, and is no less distinctive than the first, which brought the author a substantial money reward and no little literary fame.\\"Stopford Brooke. Peace of Mind: Essays and Reflections, August 1914 – September 1917 Lyle's third novel was The Education of a Young Man: In Twelve Lessons (published by L.& V. Woolf at the Hogarth Press, 1926). A review in The Spectator described this as \\"A cleverly written story about a peculiar county family of great charm but considerable eccentricity and even unpleasantness. The tale is told in the first person and somewhat pretentiously. One will soon cease to believe in sinister families of high degree, so many have been described since Mr. Michael Sadleir paved the way.\\"The Spectator, 21 May 1926, p. 29 Her following novel was Out of Drawing (Gerald Howe, London,1928). The Spectator reviewer wrote: \\"Mr. Lyle presents us with a three-sided study of a young American artist of genius. We see Aloys Staine through her own eyes, and also through those of her Spanish husband and an Englishman who constitutes himself her sponsor when she visits this country. Many of the incidental scenes, ranging from London and Paris to Tangier and the Argentine, are vivid and piquant, and the story displays considerable powers of analysis. But Mr. Lyle is too diffuse and leisurely, and the total effect is consequently a little blurred.\\"The Spectator,3 November, 1928, p. 105 In 1932 she published a slim (46-page) hand-printed volume titled The Virgin: A Tale of Woe (designed by Christopher Sandford with a frontispiece engraved on wood by Lettice Sandford and printed at the Boar's Head Press, Manaton, Devon in an edition of 200 copies,1932).

The gateway adjoins Reading Crown Court and Forbury Gardens and is one of only two abbey buildings that have survived intact, the other being the Hospitium of St John the Baptist. It is a grade I listed building, and includes a porters lodge on the ground floor and a large open room above the gate. The gateway marked the division between the area of the abbey open to the public and the section accessible only to monks, with the abbot's lodging just inside the gateway. The gateway thus became the meeting place between the abbot, who commanded considerable powers within the town, and the people of the town. In 1539, after the dissolution, Hugh Faringdon, the last abbot of Reading was hanged, drawn, and quartered outside the abbey gateway. Whilst the other buildings of the abbey were stripped for lead and stone, the abbot's lodging was turned into a royal palace on the orders of Edward Seymour, who was acting as lord protector as King Edward VI was still a child. The abbey gateway was also retained, as the entrance to the royal residence. Edward's sister, Queen Elizabeth I, was a regular visitor to the royal palace, but during the Civil War the old abbot’s lodgings were damaged, and were not used as a royal palace again. Eventually the palace was demolished and new houses were built alongside the gateway. In the late 18th century one of them was home to the Reading Ladies’ Boarding School, attended amongst others by the novelist Jane Austen. The school used the room above the gateway as a classroom. The gateway was heavily restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott, after a partial collapse during a storm in 1861. In 1900 a series of twelve heads, sculpted by Andrew Ohlson, were added to the gateway. In 2010, the gateway was closed and fencing erected when some of the decorative stonework came loose and fell into the street. It reopened in 2018 after an extensively restoration, which was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The room above the gateway is now used by Reading Museum as part of its learning programme for local schools, whilst the arch below is available for use by pedestrian and cycle traffic. The Reading Half Marathon, held every year in March or April, passes under the gateway at around the stage.

She tried to take over the SGC, but ultimately her arrogance leads to her downfall and eventual death. * In Capcom's Street Fighter video game series, Hathor uses another form name, Menat. With a slightly different hieroglyphic spelling, it referred to an ancient Egyptian artifact which was closely connected with the goddess Hathor. It was used as a protective amulet, meant to ensure good luck and fortune and to protect against evil spirits. She uses soul power and magic ball in her fighting style.

Horus, the sky god, is initially bent on vengeance, but learns, toward the end of the film, that his real focus should be on protecting his people and to believe in himself. After he overthrows Set, he institutes a new policy: No longer were riches required in order to enter the afterlife; now, people were to be judged by whether their deeds in life were good. Horus was played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. While Horus usually assumes a fully humanoid, albeit one with uncanny accuracy, he can turn into a human- falcon hybrid for combat purposes. * In the Games Workshop tabletop franchise Warhammer 40,000, Horus Lupercal is the main antagonist of the Horus Heresy. The story is contains many elements of Egyptian mythology, including the Eye of Horus and the pivotal confrontation between Horus and the protagonist, The Emperor: similar to Horus's confrontation with Set. * In Stardust Crusaders, the third story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Horus is represented by the stand of the antagonist Pet Shop, an intelligent falcon, referencing Horus' falcon head. Horus manifests in Pet Shop as his ability to control ice, and can also form into a pterodactyl-like creature. * Horus is one of the deities used by the Pharaoh in the episode of the same name in Miraculous Ladybug, giving him the power of flight. *Horus appears as a demon in the Megami Tensei series.

While classed as a warrior, and therefore having the potential to both deal and absorb damage, he is most often played as a guardian (i.e. tank). This is because of his ability to both support and set up for his team. He can target his teammates and dash to their aid, healing them and providing extra protections, as well as the ability to lock down enemies by knocking them up with a gust of wind from his wings and then stunning them. He can also teleport his team by flying to any ground location. Combined with his ability to shred enemy protections, he can facilitate his team for extra damage. His kit all tie into his lore as a protector and the god of the sky. Interestingly, his passive stacks once each time he is hit by another character in the game, but if this character is Set, he will gain two stacks per hit, tying into the fierce rivalry between the two. Isis * Portrayed as a blonde woman, Isis is one of ten pagan gods that met at the Elysian Fields Hotel to try to figure out a way to prevent the Christian Apocalypse in \\"Hammer of the Gods,\\" the season 5, episode 19 episode of the U.

She is slaughtered by Lucifer. * Played by Rachael Blake, Isis is the wife of Osiris in the 2016 film Gods of Egypt. * Isis is a playable goddess in Smite She is classified as a mage and is labeled as \\"The Goddess of Magic\\". She is more team-oriented than her more damage- oriented mage brethren, and comes equipped with a versatile ability kit to deal with most situations. She is strongest in the thick of battle allowing her ultimate move, Circle of Protection, to mitigate damage dealt to herself and her teammates, and charge up a heal and heavy damage when the circle is detonated, and she is weakest when alone or if she uses her spells unwisely. As previously mentioned, she also lacks some of the extra punch that other mages have. *Isis appears as a demon in the Megami Tensei series. She first appeared in Majin Tensei II: Spiral Nemesis. *Isis has a small role in romance author Nina Bangs's book series \\"Castle of Dark Dreams\\" as the ex-lover of Holgarth and the mother of his son.  Khnum  * In Stardust Crusaders, the third story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Khnum is represented by the stand of the antagonist Oingo. Much in how Khnum is known as the Divine Potter, the Stand Khnum gives Oingo the ability to mold his flesh like clay. * In Episode 46, \\"Hercules and the Romans,\\" of Hercules, Hercules's friend Icarus pretends to be a deity for the newly settled city of Rome. Ra, Bastet, and Khnum appear to become true gods of Rome, having been requested by the Romans themselves, and try to destroy Hercules and Icarus. Only Ra actually speaks in the episode. Khonsu * The Marvel Comics character Moon Knight gained his powers after being resurrected by Khonsu (in the comics known as Khonshu). * In an episode of the TV series Stargate SG-1, Khonsu poses as one of the Goa'uld, a race of parasitic aliens who set themselves up as the gods of human mythology and have ruled the galaxy for thousands of years. At the time he appears, Khonsu is a minor lord sworn to Anubis. Khonsu is secretly part of the Tok'ra resistance that opposes the Goa'uld regime and their false theocracy. * In Worm by Wildbow, Khonsu is the name of an Endbringer who has special powers related to time. *Khonsu appears as a Genma demon in the Megami Tensei series. His main appearance was as a random encounter in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner. * In the novel The Claws of Time by Jason Charles, Khonsu sends the female protagonist Dimiza/River five hundred and twenty years into the future (from 1483 to 2003) to escape being executed by her lover, King Richard III, whom she helped become king. Medjed *In the illustration to the spell on sheet 76 of the Greenfield papyrus, what is thought to be Medjed is depicted as a figure covered entirely in a conical covering except for the eyes and feet, which are visible. After the papyrus was exhibited in 2012 at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and the Fukuoka Museum of Art, Medjed became a sensation on Japanese social media. The god was embraced by Japanese popular culture, including as an internet meme and as a character in video games. Journal of Geek Studies 4(2): 10-20. **In Persona 5, Futaba's hacker group is named Medjed, likely as a reference to the meme. **Nitocris' summer outfit in Fate/Grand Order is also designed after that depiction of Medjed. Nephthys * Despite being the wife of Set in the 2016 film Gods of Egypt, Nephthys, played by Emma Booth, does not support his power-hungry ways. As such, Set assaults her and takes her wings. * In Age of Mythology and Age of Empires: Mythologies, Nephthys is a minor goddess who can be worshiped by followers of Set and Isis. Her improvements benefit the player's priests, making them do increased damage to myth units (units based on various mythical beings) and improve their healing ability. Osiris * Played by Faran Tahir, Osiris is the principle villain in \\"Defending Your Life,\\" the season 7, episode 4 episode of the U. S. television series Supernatural (14 October 2011). He is the Egyptian god of the dead, and he puts people who feel guilty on trial. Able to see into a person's heart, he sentences to death any who carries more than a feather's weight of guilt, commanding ghosts or spectres to carry out the sentence in a manner reflecting the defendant's guilt. In the episode, Osiris tries Dean and sentences him to death, but is stopped by Sam, who casts him into a centuries-long sleep by stabbing him with a shofar before Dean is killed. * Osiris is played by Bryan Brown in the 2016 film Gods of Egypt. He is the King of Egypt and a just god. As he is about to crown his son, Horus, as his successor, his brother, Set murders him and takes the crown for himself. * Osiris is a playable god in Smite. Osiris is classified as a warrior and is labeled \\"The Broken God of the Afterlife\\" in reference to how Set chopped him into pieces. Osiris is seen as one of the most difficult characters to play effectively as his strategy is to slowly whittle away at the enemy with superior boxing, lane clear and strategic ability and basic attack usage while not having a designated \\"finisher\\"-style move. He is strongest in the thick of battle mitigating damage and annoying more damage- based characters, and as a warrior, does not have a true weakness. Warriors are a jack-of-all-trades class, and thus mostly do not excel at anything aside from being a meat-shield. If their team is weak, they are weak as well. * An alien guest character in The Sims Freeplay for mobile devices is named Osiris. * In Stargate SG-1, Osiris is a Goa'uld. Like many other Goa'uld, Osiris is several thousand years old, though this is due in Osiris' case to being forcibly removed from its former host in Ancient Egypt and put in a stasis chamber. Though Osiris is normally portrayed as male in mythology, Goa'uld themselves are genderless, and only reproduce by having queens spawn, and the human host, Sarah Gardner, played by Anna-Louise Plowman, is female. She is an antagonist in the series, and is subservient to another Goa'uld, Anubis. * The exoplanet HD 209458 b is sometimes given the nickname Osiris. * The reserve boat for Oxford University Women's Boat Club (OUWBC) is called Osiris. * In Yu-Gi-Oh!, Osiris is an Egyptian God Card known as\\"Saint Dragon Osiris.\\" In the English dub he is known as \\"Slifer The Sky Dragon\\". * In Stardust Crusaders, the third story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Osiris is represented by the Stand of the antagonist Daniel J. D'Arby. Much in how the real Osiris is the god of the underworld, the Stand Osiris allows D'Arby to steal the souls of others if they admit defeat. *Osiris is a member of the Deity race of demons in the Megami Tensei series. He first appeared in Ronde for the Sega Saturn. * In La-Mulana 2, Osiris is one of the 5th Children. Lumisa receives an important item when she speaks with him in the Underworld. * In Age of Mythology and Age of Empires: Mythologies, Osiris is a minor god who can be worshiped by followers of Ra and Isis. His improvements benefit the player's camels and give them an extra pharaoh (which serves as the hero unit of Egypt). Osiris is notably the only Egyptian god who appears in-game, as the player is tasked with reuniting his body parts so he can oppose Set's mortal followers (who are working with Poseidon's agents to free the Titans). Ra * In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones must use the headpiece of the Staff of Ra to find the location of the Ark of the Covenant, which is hidden in Tanis. * Harvey Birdman, the titular character in the Hanna-Barbera animated series Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and, later, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is a winged superhero who was said to have gained abilities of flight and solar projection from the Sun-God Ra. * In 2015, SolarCity began a new marketing campaign featuring Ra \\"at home\\" as a servant of the homeowner, inviting customers to \\"harness the power of the Sun and save.\\" * Ra is the main villain of the 1994 film Stargate. In it, he is an alien that enslaves ancient Egyptians and brings them to a planet on the other side of the known universe using a device known as a Stargate. In the TV series that followed, Ra was retroactively established as the most powerful of the Goa'uld, a race of parasitic aliens that set themselves up as gods of human mythology and used humanity as a host and slave race across the galaxy. * In channeled messages of the New Age community, Ra is presented as an extraterrestrial entity presenting a central message of \\"...only one important statement...All things, all of life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.\\" * In Episode 46, \\"Hercules and the Romans,\\" of Hercules, Hercules's friend Icarus pretends to be a deity for the newly settled city of Rome. Ra, Bastet, and Khnum appear to become true gods of Rome, having been requested by the Romans themselves, and try to destroy Hercules and Icarus. Only Ra actually speaks in the episode. * Ra is a playable god in Smite. He is classified as a mage labeled as \\"Sun God\\". He was one of the first gods designed for the game, and has a matching simple ability kit. He is strongest when not fighting, as he has a strong healing circle that can be placed after fights to prepare for the next one, and is weakest when his primary damage abilities, which are long, narrow lines, miss. He is one of the only gods in the game to have a team heal, and very few are as potent as his, although the wounded must actually stay inside the circle, making Ra's team somewhat immobile if healing is required. * In season four of the Syfy reality television series Face Off, the contestant Eric F. created a Ra mummy based on the Evil Dead franchise. * In Yu-Gi-Oh!, Ra is an Egyptian God Card called \\"The Winged Dragon Of Ra\\" or \\"Sun Dragon Ra.\\" * The Dagger of Amon Ra, the second game in the Laura Bow series of graphic adventures, features a Ra cult as a plot element. * The House of Anubis special is titled Touchstone of Ra. * The MOBA League of Legends champion named Azir resembles Ra * In the video game Age of Mythology and its remake, Age of Empires: Mythologies, Ra is one of three major gods that can be worshiped by Egyptian players. This serves mostly as a gameplay element and Ra himself does not appear in-game. When worshipped, Ra boosts a player's camels, chariots, and economy. ** In Age of Mythology: The Titans, the Egyptian can summon a falcon-headed Titan heavily based on Ra. * \\"Ra: The God of The Sun\\", is a marching band show composed by Rob Stein with Ra as the central theme. * In Savage Dragon, the character PowerHouse is a descendant of Ra. * In Overwatch, there is a Ra hero-skin for the character Zenyatta. * Ra, played by Geoffrey Rush, is depicted in the 2016 film Gods of Egypt as a creator god who drags the sun across the sky daily and slays the dæmon Apophis nightly. He is the father of Osiris and Set. * Ra is a recurring joke in the podcast \\"This Paranormal Life\\". He is first mentioned in #021 Real Life Vampires in 2017 where they joke about leaving everything to Ra in their will. They later did an entire Patreon Only Podcast on Ra and Ra is featured on their T-shirts alongside the catchphrase \\"Praise Ra!\\" * Ra (mostly referred to as Amon-Ra) appears as a demon in the Megami Tensei. He first appeared in Shin Megami Tensei If.... * In La-Mulana 2, Ra is one of the Amarna tribe of 5th Children and also known as the Dark Star Lord.

She is also seen in the same author's comic book \\"Karl Vincent: Vampire Hunter\\" issues 1-6 which adapts the novel. She will be played by actress Jasmine Yampierre in the film version from Crisp Film Works. * Sekhmet is used in The 39 Clues book Beyond the Grave and is the reason why the characters travel to Cairo. * Sekhmet is also featured in The Red Pyramid written by Rick Riordan as a minor antagonist. * Sekhmet is the subject of \\"Lionheart\\" a song about the goddess by the symphonic power metal band, Amberian Dawn from their The Clouds of Northland Thunder album. * Sekhmet is the focus of \\"Resurrection\\", an episode of Stargate SG-1.

Whiteside's World of the Guardians book series. Set in modern-day New Orleans, Sekhmet goes by the name of Syn. * Sekhmet appears in the Big Finish Doctor Who audio drama, The Bride of Peladon. She is an Osiran. * The Temple of Goddess Spirituality in Southern Nevada is dedicated to the Goddess Sekhmet. * Sekhmet is the subject of Margaret Atwood's poem titled \\"Sekhmet, the Lion-headed Goddess of War\\". * In the comic The Wicked + The Divine, Sekhmet (spelled Sakhmet) is one of twelve gods who reincarnate every 90 years only to die within two years.

This is mainly due to the fact that Tarna and its location in East Fricana is heavily inspired by ancient Egypt, as well as African tribal lore. *Sekhmet appears as a demon in the Megami Tensei series.

Set =Literature= * In American Gods, Set is mentioned to have retired in San Francisco in 1906, the time of the San Francisco earthquake, hinting he was responsible for it. * In the Conan mythos, Set is worshiped as a snake god by the people of Stygia in the Hyborean Age. Set never makes an appearance in the original Conan stories and is referred to as \\"Father Set\\" or \\"the Old Serpent\\". The Conan version of Set also inspired the Set of the Marvel Universe due to Marvel acquiring the rights to Conan in the early 1970s and incorporated Conan's Hyborian Age into the prehistoric days of Earth. However the Hydra-headed snake deity depiction of this god owes little to the Egyptian Set as this version is one of the Elder Gods of Earth within the Marvel Universe and is billions of years old. * The Egyptian Gods have made occasional appearances within comic books published by Marvel, including Set, though his name is spelled \\"Seth\\" to differentiate him from the Elder God of the same name. He's much closer to the Egyptian deity in that he's associated with darkness, chaos and death. * In Soldier of Sidon, a novel by Gene Wolfe, Set plays a major role in the journey of a Roman soldier in ancient Egypt. * In Creatures of Light and Darkness by Roger Zelazny, Set is captured by Anubis who erases his memory and sends him to kill Thoth. * In The World of the Guardians book series by S.K.

The god Set was reinterpreted as Sutekh (also known as \\"The Destroyer\\"), the most vicious, destructive and pan- genocidal of the Osirians, who was imprisoned circa 5000 BC in Egypt. Sutekh was also the main antagonist in The True History of Faction Paradox, part of the Doctor Who spin-off series Faction Paradox. He featured in a series of six Faction Paradox audio plays (the first of which, Coming to Dust, was released in 2004) which further explored Osirian society and also featured other Osirian characters including Horus. * In the 2016 film Gods of Egypt, Set (Gerard Butler) is the main antagonist. He murders his brother Osiris as he was about to crown Horus the new King of Egypt, taking the crown for himself, enslaving the mortals, and killing any gods who challenge his claim to authority. Unsatisfied with the station his father Ra has in mind for him, he attempts to murder his own father, and releases the demon Apophis in order to let chaos remake the world and claim dominion over the afterlife. He is ultimately defeated by Horus and a mortal named Bek. Much like his nephew, he has the ability to morph into an animal human hybrid, in his case a jackal, but can also incorporate the parts of other Gods, using a combination of Nephthys's wings, Osiris's heart, Thoth's brain, and one of Horus's eyes. * Seth appears in the Isis and Osiris two-parter in the Canadian series MythQuest, fulfilling his usual role as Osiris's killer. * In Mummies Alive!, Set and Anubis are secondary villains throughout the series, often summoned with other deities to cause trouble in the show. Instead of a set animal, however, Set is made to look like an anthropomorphic bull dog. * In seaQuest DSV, Set is used as a villain in \\"Something in the Air\\", a season 2 episode of the science fiction series. * In Stargate SG-1, Seth, or Setesh, is a Goa'uld. In the series, Seth has been hiding from Ra on Earth for thousands of years, using advanced technology and drugs to set himself up as the object of worship for various cults throughout history. * In the Puppet Master series of horror films, Sutekh is the primary villain, revealed in Puppet Master 4, to be the elder god who created the magic that gives the Puppet Master's puppets life. * In Tutenstein, Set is the villain of the series, repeatedly trying to steal Tut's Scepter of Was to rule the Underworld and Overworld. * Set, portrayed by Javier Botet, is a major antagonist in the 2017 film The Mummy, in which he gives Ahmanet The Dagger of Set to bring him into the real world through the body of a mortal. However, while her initial attempt to summon him through her lover fails, Set ultimately ends up fused with Nick Morton, the main protagonist. * In the series finale of the 2001 anime series Hellsing, a demon named Set was summoned from the underworld by Incognito. Incognito calls upon the power of the Serpent God Seth in his attempt to defeat Alucard and conquer Britain. Set appears as a giant glowing snake made of energy, ravaging London in all of a few minutes. * In the anime/manga Yu-Gi-Oh!, Seto Kaiba is regarded as the reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian priest Seth, who is representative of the deity Set. The same applies to Pharaoh Atem (Yami Yugi), representing the deity Horus, thus also highlighting the rivalry the two characters share, just as the gods Horus and Set did in Egyptian mythology. * In Samurai Jack, Aku releases the minions of Set and orders them to kill Samurai Jack in the episode \\"Jack in Egypt\\". They all appear to be stylized versions of the seth animal. * In the last episode of the 1988 revival of Mission: Impossible, the team works to thwart a museum curator who wishes to use Set as a part of his plan to revive the pharaonic system, with himself as pharaoh. \\"The Sands of Seth\\" =Video games= * Seth frequently appears as a demon throughout the Megami Tensei series. ** Seth is an optional boss in Digital Devil Saga 2 after Shiva and Vishnu and before Satan. * In Nightshade, Sutekh is the villain who takes control of every gang in Metro City, combining them into one. * In Persona 2 and Persona 5 Set is a persona of the Tower Arcana. * In Persona 3 and Persona 4, Seth is a persona of the Moon Arcana. * In Phantasy Star IV, Seth was the name used by Dark Force when he assumed human form.

Later he reveals his real god form: a powerful humanoid giant snake. * In Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Set possessed Werner Von Croy and he was also the final boss. * In Vampire: the Masquerade, One of the 13 clans is known as the Followers of Set and claim to be descended from the god Set. * In Pharaoh, Seth is one of the five gods that can be worshipped in-game. * In Age of Mythology and Age of Empires: Mythologies, Set is one of three major gods that can be worshiped by Egyptian players. When this is the case, players can turn huntable animals into units for combat and scouting, and ranged units are trained faster and are stronger. In the game's campaign, Set, through his mortal puppet Kemsyt, works with Poseidon and Loki to free the Titans. The player, in the role of the Atlantean hero Arkantos, must stop Set's followers and re-unify the pieces of Osiris. * In Endless Ocean: Blue World, Set, Isis, Osiris, and Nephthys are featured in the Cavern of the Gods. * In The Cluefinders 4th Grade Adventures: Puzzle of the Pyramid, Set is the true villain of the game, released by Sir Alistar Loveless III. Loveless intended to be Set's master and use him to rule the world, but Set turned on Loveless and his goons. With enhanced powers granted to the Cluefinders by other Egyptian gods, the title group reseals Set back in his prison. * In Smite, Set and Horus were made playable characters, in April 2019. Set gains the title of \\"The Usurper\\" in reference to his murder of Osiris. He is classed as an assassin, and focuses on single-target burst damage. Able to command sand clones to attack enemies, Set also has high mobility as he can teleport to these clones at any time. He can also summon a sandstorm around his character, damaging enemies and causing their screens to fill up with sand. These abilities fit into his mythological role as a god of the desert. Set's murder is also referenced in his ultimate, Kingslayer, which allows Set to focus down and kill a single target with multiple buffs, including a movement speed buff, an uncapped, stacking attack speed buff, a buff that allows his attacks to affect nearby gods, self-healing and the ability to summon many more of his sand clones. His kit makes him a potent asset to any team when it comes to diving back-line gods and finishing them off quickly. Interestingly, he gets one stack on his passive if he attacks an enemy god, but if his target is Horus, he gains two stacks per hit, reflecting the pair's fierce rivalry. =Music= * Set is referenced by the American heavy metal band Iced Earth on some of their concept albums.

Sobek  * In the videogame Assassin's Creed: Origins, Sobek features as one of three gods that the player can fight in the \\"Trial of the Gods\\" limited time events. * In the 2017 videogame Horizon Zero Dawn by Guerrilla Games, a prominent scientist involved in the life-saving Zero Dawn project is named Elizabet Sobeck. * In the 1995-1997 comic series based on the original Battlestar Galactica the name of the last living, biological Cylon imperious leader was revealed to be \\"Sobekkta\\", a reference to Sobek. * In Smite, Sobek is guardian given the title of \\"God of the Nile\\". * The MOBA League of Legends champion named Renekton resembles Sobek. * In the Megami Tensei series, Sobek sometimes appears as a demon. While his first appearance was in Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, his most notable appearance was as an optional boss in Shin Megami Tensei If.... * The Cluefinders 4th Grade Adventures: Puzzle of the Pyramid features a brief appearance by Sobek as one of a quartet of Egyptian gods who imbue the eponymous Cluefinders with magic powers so that they can challenge the recently revived Set. Sobek grants Santiago enhanced strength and turns his skin a greyish-green, highlighting his crocodile basis. *Sobek has been heavily satirized by YouTuber hbomberguy in his video Flat Earth: A Measured Response, and went on to become a meme within his community. *Sobek appears as the monster in \\"Trading Chases\\", the sixth episode of the first season of Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!, terrorizing a museum that had recently acquired a sarcophagus. However, like other villains in the franchise, he was the disguise of a human, in this case, one of the professors who was trying to get a gold statue from inside said sarcophagus. Thoth * Aleister Crowley's book on the Tarot is entitled The Book of Thoth: A Short Essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, Being The Equinox Volume III No. V (see The Book of Thoth (Crowley)). *Thoth-Amon (also spelled Thoth-amon) is a fictional character created by Robert E. Howard. He is an evil wizard in \\"The Phoenix on the Sword\\", the first of the Conan the Cimmerian stories. He is often used as Conan's arch enemy in derivative works but the two characters never met in any of Howard's original stories. He was obviously named after the Egyptian deity Thoth and possibly has a connection. The god Thoth along with his Egyptian look is called Ibis and he is a lesser Stygian god who opposes to Set. * Thoth is also heavily mentioned in the Matthew Reilly novels Seven Ancient Wonders and The Six Sacred Stones. An entire language was created based on Thoth's religious omnipotence. There are also many allusions to his importance in Egyptian history throughout the books. * Thoth and the cosmology presented in the Book of Thoth are major elements of the plots in the King's Man trilogy by the Canadian novelist Pauline Gedge. * The computer game NetHack, which features deities whose favor the player must win in order to succeed features Thoth as the god of neutral (balanced alignment) Wizards, in keeping with his role as God of Balance and Wisdom. * Philosopher Jacques Derrida uses Socrates' \\"Myth of Theuth\\" to argue for deconstruction and the instability of Truth since writing is pharmakon, both poison and cure—that which puts play into play. * The Coptic liturgical New Year begins with the month of Thout which is a carry over from the ancient Egyptian month dedicated to Thoth. The first day of Thoth corresponds, currently, to the eleventh of September in the Gregorian calendar or the twelfth if a leap year Coptic calendar.\\"The Oxford History of Christian Worship\\", Geoffrey Wainwright, Karen Beth Westerfield Tucker, p.139, Oxford University Press US, 2006ISBN 0195138864 * In Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods, Thoth lives as a human called Mr. Ibis on the mortal plane in the \\"Little Egypt\\" area of Southern Illinois. In accordance with his role as judge of the dead, he works as an undertaker alongside Anubis' human embodiment, Mr. Jacquel (Jackal). * The current logo of Cairo University, which is the oldest university in Egypt, embodies the image of Thoth sitting on his throne. * The Temple of Thoth is the name of a pagan cult in The Magician's Nephew, an episode of Midsomer Murders. Apart from the name, no references to the Egyptian god are made in the episode. * Thoth is one of the main characters in Roger Zelazny's novel Creatures of Light and Darkness * In the game Zone of the Enders and Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, the game's titular mecha Jehuty is based on Thoth himself. * The Cluefinders 4th Grade Adventures: Puzzle of the Pyramid, a 1990s video game for young learners, features Thoth as a non-player character. Thoth guides the eponymous Cluefinders across the \\"Chasm of Words\\", with the assistance of a pair of baboon statues. * In the Stargate SG-1 franchise, Thoth is a member of the Goa'uld. Various interpretations of the character appeared in spin-off media before the character appeared in the series itself as a minor Goa'uld, the chief scientist of Anubis * In the \\"otome\\" game series Kamigami no Asobi, which features various deities brought to an academy by Zeus to restore the divine's connection to humans, Thoth is recruited as a teacher in the academy and is also a romance option. * Thoth is one of the gods used by the Pharaoh in Miraculous Ladybug in the episode of the same name, though unlike other depictions, the animal used to represent him is a baboon, and while using his power, the Pharaoh gains time manipulation powers, using gold colored bubbles to slow down those trapped inside them. * In the 2016 film Gods of Egypt, Thoth is played by Chadwick Boseman. Boseman's casting attracted media attention, as he was one of the few non-white actors to appear in the film, with some suggesting that Boseman as Thoth was essentially an example of the Magical Negro stock character.  * Thoth is a playable god in Smite. He is classified as a mage, and is labeled \\"The Arbiter of the Damned\\". He is strongest when located far away from his enemies, as one of his abilities, Glyph of Pain, adds extra range to his other damaging moves, giving him more space control and safety than almost any other mage. He is weakest when behind his opponents in gold and experience, as he will do fairly little damage compared to other mages in the same situation. He has been a polarizing character, with some finding him annoying with his constant threat of damage, and others finding him weak as he has very little crowd control. * In Stardust Crusaders, the third story arc of the manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Thoth is represented by the Stand of the antagonist Boingo, spelled Tohth. In the same vein of Thoth being the god of knowledge and writing, Tohth takes the form of a comic book that predicts the future. *Thoth frequently appears in the Megami Tensei series. His first appearance was in Shin Megami Tensei If... as an optional boss that would instead join the party if Sobek and Hathor were in the player's party. In Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey, Thoth has a chain of side missions that rewards the player with passages that can be used to summon a powerful version of Seth when arranged and the powerful Divine Sword.

Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years. It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development. It went out of existence in 2010. Trade show The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product. These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design.Floristry author and judge Lynda Owen describes the successful trade show Cirque des Fleurs held in 2008 at History The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF). When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted. As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also. The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF. The courses came into existence during 2006. This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible. However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded. On 28 February 2010 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.

Not a wall in the true sense of the word, the South-east wall was rather a series of German batteries and anti-tank ditches built at strategic locations alongside the southeastern border of the German Reich in 1944/45 with the intention of stopping the Red Army.

Amico Aspertini also made a drawing of the vase, but giving a location a santo francesco in tristeuaro.800 meters distant, according to Leoncini 1991. At any rate, by the time it was drawn by Maarten van Heemskerck in the 1530s the vase had been erected in the garden of Cardinal Paolo Emilio Cesi, on the northern slope of the Janiculum near St Peter's Basilica. A statue of Silenus emptying water from a wineskin into the vase, which had been drilled for use as a fountain, was associated with it. Ulisse Aldrovandi described it in a new, central position in the Cesi garden in 1550, with the Silenus standing inside the bowl of the vase; this revision was probably carried out for Cardinal Francesco Cesi.Aldrovandi quoted in Leoncini 1991:103. The Flemish artist Pieter Perret created an engraving of the Fountain with Silenus in the Garden of the Cesi Palace in 1581. The engraving is part of the print collection in the Chicago Art Institute and can be viewed online. Towards the end of the 16th century the contents of the Cesi garden began to be dispersed, and no further artistic record of the vase was made until the 18th century, when both the vase and the Silenus were purchased by Alessandro Albani. Luca Leoncini suggests the possibility that the vase had been in the Palazzo del Drago 'alle Quattro Fontane, which Albani purchased from the heirs of Cardinal Camillo Massimi, with all its contents.Leoncini 1991:102. In 1760 Albani moved it to his newly built Villa Albani, where the vase at first was a feature in the hall of the caffè, then in the villa's Porticus Romae.Where it was drawn by Pierre-Adrien Pâris, c 1765-78; Leoncini 1991, cat. no. 28. There, in Cardinal Albani's much-visited collection, it provided a model for the Piranesi Vase, a pastiche composed of various antique fragments and modern elements created by Giovanni Battista Piranesi. When the Albani collection was eventually inherited by the Castelbarco family, the vase was resited in the villa's casina. In 1869 Prince Alessandro Torlonia, having inherited the collection, moved the vase to his private museum, leaving the Silenus at the Villa Albani. The neo-Attic vase found on the Lungotevere in Sassia. A comparable neo-Attic marble vase was unearthed in fragmented condition near the Ospedale Santo Spirito, on the Lungotevere in Sassia, Rome, in 1929. It is conserved in the Museo Nazionale Romano.Leoncini 1991:100f See also *Borghese Vase *Medici Vase Notes Hellenistic and Roman sculptural vases Hellenistic-style Roman sculptures Garden vases ","title":"Torlonia Vase"},{"id":"28967793","title":"Sharon Cherop"},{"id":"28967797","text":"Jeziorak Iława is a Polish football club based in Iława, Poland. It was founded in 1945. The team's official colors are white and blue. Jeziorak played in the second division for five years and spent multiple seasons at the third level of Polish association football. Achievements * 5 seasons at the second tier of Polish association football - including a 4th place in 1995/96, * Reaching the quarter-finals of the Polish Cup - 1995. History The club was established in 1945, the exact date being arbitrary. Initially, it was called Warmia. In May 1946, the football team played their first match against Drwęca Nowe Miasto Lubawskie. In 1947, the club's name was changed to Kolejarz. Ten years later, the current name, Jeziorak was adopted. In 2014, a new association, initially called ITR and later renamed to ITS Jeziorak, which continues the traditions of the club established in 1945, was founded. =League history= In 1956, the football team was promoted to the third division for the first time and played at this level for three consecutive seasons. From the 1960s until the 1980s, the club oscillated between the third and fifth league level. In 1988, the team was promoted to the third division. It marked the start of the most successful period in the club's history. From 1989 onwards, Jeziorak's results in the third division improved with each passing season. In 1995, the team finished second at the third level. However, FC Piaseczno, then a second division club, gave up its place at that level for financial reasons. The Warsaw Regional Football Association suggested that a playoff match between the fifteenth team of the second division, Radomiak Radom, and the runner-up at the third level, Jeziorak Iława, was held to decide which team gets the second-tier spot. Having been approved by the central authorities, the match was held on 30 July 1995 in Warsaw. Jeziorak won 5–1 and gained promotion to the second division (II liga). During the 1995/96 season, right after having being promoted, Jeziorak was the leader of II liga at the halfway stage. Ultimately, the club finished fourth out of 18 teams in the eastern group of the second division. This has been the best result in the club's entire history so far. The following season, Jeziorak was ranked eight, and one year later - seventh. In 1998/99, the season when the number of teams participating in both second division groups was reduced from 18 to 16, Jeziorak finished ninth, avoiding relegation by just one point. In 1999/00, the two groups of the second division were merged to create a single II liga that numbered 24 teams. Jeziorak only managed to finish 20th, as a result of which, the club was relegated to the third division. In 2000/01, the club finished 17th out of 20 teams in the third division and was relegated once again. Mounting debt is given as one of the reasons for this failure. Jeziorak spent the following four seasons at the fourth level. While the club managed to win promotion back to the third level in 2005, the team finished 12th out of 15 teams and returned to the fourth division the following year where it stayed for the next two seasons. After the 2007/08 season, the league system in Poland was reformed. Jeziorak, having won its group of the fourth division, participated in playoffs against Unia Tarnów winning in a penalty shootout and gaining promotion to the new II liga. Jeziorak played at the third level for the following four seasons. However, continuous financial problems resulted in the team being relegated and then, withdrawing from participating at the fourth level in 2012. Jeziorak spent the following two seasons (2012/13 and 2013/14) in the klasa okręgowa, the sixth level of association football in Poland. In 2014, the team started anew by joining the klasa B which is the eight division - the lowest level of association football in the region. While the team only managed to finish fourth in 2014/15, from the following season onwards, Jeziorak has been steadily climbing the league ladder, winning the klasa B in 2016, the klasa A in 2017, and the klasa okręgowa in 2018. =In the Polish Cup= The club's most notable result at the central level of the Polish Cup was achieved during the 1994/95 season. In the fall of 1994, before being promoted to the second division, Jeziorak won against Polonia Chodzież (third division at the time) in a penalty shootout in the first round, proceeding to win against Stomil Olsztyn (recently promoted to the top tier of Polish association football) in a penalty shootout in the second round. Both matches ended in 0–0 draws. In the third round, Jeziorak won against Elana Toruń (third division) 4–1 after extra time. In the fourth round, Jeziorak decisively won against the top-tier team, Górnik Zabrze, 3–1. Jeziorak proceeded to eliminate Amica Wronki (second division) 1–0 in the fifth round. The club reached the quarterfinals of the cup being eliminated by Lech Poznań, another top-tier club, the following spring. Jeziorak managed to reach the 16th-finals or round of 32 on other occasions by eliminating lower- tier teams. This took place in 1997, 2000, 2006 and 2007.

It stars Ray Brooks, Jenny Hanley and Luan Peters. Plot An anonymous producer assembles a group of unemployed actors and actresses to be in a play, rehearsing in an abandoned theatre beside the sea. A murderer, who wears black gloves, kills all of the actors in various ways. The murderer is later revealed to have previously been an actor, who trapped his wife and her new lover in the wall, re-emerging 30 years later to commit murder again. Production The seaside theatre in the film was the Pavilion Theatre in Cromer, England. The film's ending was originally filmed and shown in cinemas in 3-D. The film's plot of young actors and actresses being murdered became a theme in the director's later work. His later horror films focused on youth and their culture being attacked by people who are older. Walker mixed elements of sexploitation films and slasher films to direct this movie. The three films that the director is most known for came after this one - House of Whipcord, Frightmare, and House of Mortal Sin. Reception Bill Gribron, writing for DVD Verdict, said, \\"This film could use all the inventive help it can get. Otherwise, it's as stiff as a British businessman's long-lamented upper lip\\". Ian Jane, of DVD Talk, wrote, \\"While The Flesh & Blood Show has definitely got its fair share of obvious flaws, it's nevertheless a fun and enjoyable horror movie with enough mildly sleazy thrills and odd characters to provide for some solid entertainment\\" Home media The film was released on DVD by Shriek Show, a division of Media Blasters, in 2006.

Keeler sought the protection of another lover, Johnny Edgecombe, which culminated in a public fight between Edgecombe and Gordon at the Flamingo Club in Wardour Street in October 1962. Gordon required 17 stitches after Edgecombe slit his face with a knife. He later posted the 17 used stitches to Keeler and warned her that for each stitch he had sent she would get two on her face in return. Edgecombe's frustrations in seeking protection from Keeler following this fight led to him firing gunshots outside Stephen Ward's flat in December 1962 that in turn set in motion a chain of events that would eventually result in the public revelations of the Profumo affair. In June 1963, Gordon was jailed for three years for assaulting Keeler, but she subsequently withdrew her accusations, and was convicted for perjury in December 1963. Musical career Gordon later worked as a cook at Island Records' studios near Ladbroke Grove (later Sarm West Studios), his employers including Bob Marley. It was while working here in the mid-1980s that Gordon contributed \\"skank\\" vocals to a cover version of \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" by pop duo Act (under the name of \\"Casbah\\"), and a rare vocal mix of the Art of Noise's \\"Moments in Love\\", both for ZTT Records.Zang Tuum Tumb Discography.

He described numerous species of insects, ticks and worked for thirteen years in Japan where he was a professor of anatomy while also serving as the first forensic physician there. Wilhelm was born to dressmaker Christoph and Caroline Dönitz and even as a young boy showed an interest in natural history and illustration. He studied medicine from 1859 to 1864 at the University of Berlin. He continued to work as a lecturer and researched on aspects of comparative zoology, anatomy and histology under Karl Bogislaus Reichert leading to being appointed Professor in 1873. He also worked with Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs. At the same time he was offered the Chair of Anatomy in Tokyo. He left Germany on 10 July 1873 for Japan after marrying Martha Schirmeister. In 1877 Japan was in a civil war and with the end of the Tokugawa dynasty, the new Meiji government was interested in German medicine especially to deal with matters of sanitation and public health. During vacations he studied Myriapoda, Arachnida (Arachnida) and Mollusca (Bivalvia) and collected these in Hakone, Odawara and Fuji. He produced all the illustrations accompanying his descriptions. In 1886 he returned to Berlin and worked with Robert Koch at the Hygiene institute and later at the Institut fur Infektionskrankheiten (Institut for Infectious diseases) founded in 1891. He became director of the Bacteriology Laboratory at Bonn where he studied cholera. From 1896 he worked at the Institut for Serumforschung and Therape at Steglitz under Paul Ehrlich. He then moved to become director of the Institute for the Institut for Infectious diseases where he acted as director during the years when Robert Koch was travelling. Ticks illustrated by Donitz (1918) He described several species of mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles and took an interest in the ticks. His collection of Palaearctic Lepidoptera is in Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin while other collections are at the Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Frankfurt. A structure in the neck of Anhinga species is named after him as the \\"bridge of Donitz\\". A sedge species Carex doenitzii was named after him by Böckeler. He suffered from a disease of the intestine and died from infection after undergoing a surgery. He was survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. He was interred in the Invalids' Cemetery.

In her lifetime she published five books of poetry, the first and the last of which received the prestigious Pushkin Prize. Due to the erotic sensuality of her works, Lokhvitskaya was regarded as the \\"Russian Sappho\\" by her contemporaries, which did not correspond with her conservative life style of dedicated wife and mother of five sons. Forgotten in Soviet times, in the late 20th century Lokhvitskaya's legacy was reassessed and she came to be regarded as one of the most original and influential voices of the Silver Age of Russian Poetry and the first in the line of modern Russian women poets who paved the way for Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva.  Biography  Maria Lokhvitskaya was born on November 19, 1869 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Her father Alexander Vladimirovich Lokhvitsky (1830–1884) was a well-known lawyer of the time, famous for his public speeches, the author of several academic works on jurisprudence. The primary source of young Maria's creative aspirations, though, was her mother Varvara Alexandrovna ( Hoer), a well- educated Frenchwoman, fond of literature and poetry. Lokhvitskaya's younger sister Nadezhda would later become a well-known humorist writer better known as Teffi, their brother Nikolay Lokhvitsky (1868–1933), a Russian White Army general and a one-time associate of Aleksandr Kolchak, fought against the Red Army forces in Siberia. Another sister Yelena Lokhvitskaya (1874–1919) wrote poetry, translated Maupassant (together with Teffi) and was a Drama Society member, but never regarded herself professional. Of Mirra's two other sisters only the names are known: Varvara Alexandrovna (Popova, in marriage) and Lydia Alexandrovna (Kozhina). In 1874 the Lokhvitsky family moved to Moscow. In 1882 Maria enrolled in the Moscow Aleksandrinsky Institute, from which she graduated in 1888. Some sources stated that her literature tutor was Apollon Maykov but modern literary historians challenge this. At age fifteen Lokhvitskaya started writing poetry and published two of her poems as a small brochure (approved by the college's authorities) not long before graduation. In 1884 Alexander Lokhvitsky died and his widow took the children back to Saint Petersburg. Maria followed suit four years later, now as a young teacher. In 1888 several of her poems, signed M. Lokhvitskaya, were published by Sever (North) magazine. Several popular literary journals became interested in the young debutante and soon the moniker \\"Mirra\\" emerged. A family legend proposes that it had to do with her dying grandfather Kondrat's mysterious parting words: \\"...and the smell of myrrh is blown away by the wind.\\" =Literary career= Mirra and Eugeny Gibert Lokhvitskaya rose to fame in 1891 after her first long poem, \\"By the Seaside\\" (У моря), appeared in the August issue of the Russkoye Obozrenye (Russian Review) magazine. She became a popular figure in the Petersburg literary circles and became friends with Vsevolod Solovyov, Ieronim Yasinsky, Vasily Nemirovich-Danchenko, Pyotr Gnedich, and Vladimir Solovyov. In late 1891, Lokhvitskaya married Eugeny Gibert, a French construction engineer, and the couple moved first to Yaroslavl, then to Moscow. They had five sons. Lokhvitskaya's first major book, a collection called Poems, 1889–1895 (Стихотворения, 1889–1895), drew positive response and brought her the prestigious Pushkin Prize in 1896, a year after its publication. \\"Never since Fet has a single poet managed to get a grip of their readership in such a way,\\" wrote her friend Vasily Nemirovich- Danchenko. Volume II (1896–1898) followed in 1898 and two years later was re- issued, coupled with the first volume, in The Complete... edition. In the course of the next few years, Lokhvitskaya published dozens of new poems, including the extensive Him and Her. Two Words (Он и Она. Два слова) and two epic dramas, Eastward (На пути к Востоку) and Vandelin. Springtime Fairytale. By the time her Volume III (1898–1900) came out, Lokhvitskaya was Russia's most popular and best-loved woman poet. Far from enjoying her stardom, though, she spent the last five years of her life in physical pain and mental turmoil. = Death = The exact cause of Lokhvitskaya's death remains unknown. Her health started to deteriorate in the late 1890s: she complained of insomnia and violent nightmares, suffered from bouts of severe depression, and later experienced chronic and ever worsening stenocardia. In 1904 Lokhvitskaya's illness progressed; she was bedridden for most of the year, tortured by pain and anxiety. In the early days of summer 1905, the family moved her to Finland, where her condition improved slightly, but on return she was hospitalized. Mirra Lokhvitskaya died on August 27, 1905. Tuberculosis has often been cited as the cause of death, but this claim remained unsubstantiated and there was no mention of it in any of the obituaries. On August 29, Lokhvitskaya was interred in Alexander Nevsky Lavra's Dukhovskaya Church, a small group of relatives and friends attending the ceremony. Among those absent was Konstantin Balmont whom she had been passionately in love with. It was the stress of this strange relationship that, as some believed, had triggered her psychological crisis, and led to moral and physical demise. \\"Her death was enigmatic. Spiritual disturbance was the cause,\\" Lokhvitskaya's friend Isabella Grinevskaya wrote in her memoirs. = Relationship with Konstantin Balmont = Konstantin Balmont Lokhvitskaya and Balmont met for the first time in the mid-1890s, in the Crimea. Sharing similar views on poetry in general, and its symbolist line of development in particular, they soon became close friends. What followed, though, was not a trivial affair, but a peculiar and obscure poetic dialogue full of allusions, to decipher the details of which one had to examine the whole bulk of the heritage of both poets. In Lokhvitskaya's poetry her lover figured as 'Lionel', after the character of Percy Bysshe Shelley (it was Balmont who translated into Russian most of the Englishman's poetry in the 1890s), a \\"youth with curls coloured ripen rye\\" and \\"eyes greenish like the sea\\". This affair instigated public discussion and was often referred to as 'scandalous'. Whether Lokhvitskaya and Balmont had ever been physically close, remained unclear. Some suggested they might have had a short affair in the early days; in the later years even in the geographical terms both were wide apart, with Balmont spending much of his time abroad. In his autobiography At the Dawn (На заре) he described their relationship as 'poetic friendship'. Modern literary historians consider their relationship to have been truly platonic affair, albeit violently passionate, frustrating and psychologically detrimental for both. In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for the last time. Thereafter, their relationship was confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with feelings of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend to be the most damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.  Personality  People who knew Lokhvitskaya personally later spoke of the stark contrast between the poet's 'bacchanal' reputation and her real life persona. The author fond of erotic imagery (whom some critics labeled 'pornographer') in reality was, according to Ivan Bunin, \\"the most chaste woman in Saint Petersburg, a faithful wife and most caring, protective mother of several children.\\" Playing 'Eastern beauty' at home, she received visitors lying languidly on a couch. Still, according to Bunin, there was not a trace of pretentiousness behind this posturing; on the contrary, the hostess greatly enjoyed matter-of-fact chattering about funny and trivial things, displaying wit and disarming self-irony. In the circle of her literary friends, Lokhvitskaya was surrounded by 'aura of adoration'; it seemed as if every man, according to a biographer, \\"was a little in love with her.\\" Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya was the only person whom he remembered fondly. \\"Everything in her was charming: the sound of her voice, the liveliness of her speech, the glitter of her eye, her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple,\\" Bunin wrote in his memoirs. Lokhvitskaya was reticent, attended literary parties on just rare occasions and her appearances there were not necessarily triumphant. \\"As she entered the stage, there was such a look of helplessness about her as to take away all the attractiveness,\\" wrote the religious author Evgeny Pogozhev (Poselyanin), remembering one such evening. Lokhvitskaya's shyness was one of the reasons why so little mention has been made of her in the extensive body of Russian Silver Age memoirs. Influential critic Akim Volynsky once confessed: \\"Sadly, Lokhvitskaya, one of the most intriguing women of the time, left but a vague trace in my memory.\\" Good looks certainly played a part, first in Lokhvitskaya's meteoric rise to fame, then in the way people \\"refused to see beyond her beauty, remaining oblivious to the sharp intelligence that was becoming more and more obvious in her work.\\" According to Alexandrova, Lokhvitskaya's was a \\"typical drama of a good-looking woman in whom most people failed o recognize anything beyond her physical attractiveness.\\"  Legacy  Mirra Lokhvitskaya's poetry on the face of it wasn't innovative; contemporary critics praised it for lightness of touch, rare musical quality and occasionally dazzling technical perfection. In retrospect it turned out that Lochvitskaya's work bore one profoundly novel element, what one critic called \\"the outright celebration of female worldview.\\" In that respect Lokhvitskaya is now considered the founder of Russian woman's poetry and a predecessor to such groundbreaking figures as Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetaeva. Another original aspect of Lokhvitskaya's poetry was its unusual frankness; she was the first woman in Russian literature to enjoy total freedom of self-expression, speaking openly of sensuality, passion and sex. The famous phrase \\"Lasciviousness equals happiness\\" (Eto stchastye – sladostrastye) summed up her attitude and has been often quoted as her chosen 'signature line'. But while passions of love remained the leitmotif of Lokhvitskaya's poetry, its context was transforming in quick and dramatic fashion, making the decade of her reign in Russian poetry an intriguing field for literary research. The critic and author Semyon Vengerov who rated her among the 'outstanding Russian poets' wrote (in Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary): There wasn't a trace of lasciviousness left in the last, fifth volume. Lokhvitskaya excluded all poems addressed to her \\"spiritual lover,\\" and what was left amounted to a fine collection of elegies full of dark premonitions, quasi-religious fables and thinly veiled farewells to her children. After her death in 1905, the lines of a late 1890s poem which sounded like a perfect epitaph have often been quoted: There were numerous misconceptions about Lokhvitskaya, according to Vengerov who refused to see in her a 'decadent' poet. \\"Totally devoid of sickly feebleness and vain extravagance\\" (generally associated with the Russian decadent movement), she was, \\"eager to enjoy life, declaring her right to put forth her feelings with all the mighty fullness of her soul,\\" he maintained. In fact, \\"the poetess's agility was very much akin to the challenges of Marxism,\\" opined the critic (a Marxist himself), while her \\"views on the meaning and reason of life belonged to the Oriental tradition,\\" even if \\"channeled through a narrow love theme.\\" If there was one thing in Lokhvitskaya's poetry that riled most of her contemporaries, that was her almost demonstrative lack of social awareness. Some saw her as a quintessentially mystic poet. Vyacheslav Ivanov, speaking of Lokhvitskaya's enigma, marveled at her \\"almost antiquely harmonious nature.\\" \\"She accepted Christianity with all the joy of unbroken soul of pagan outsider, responding to Christian demands with her wholesome, natural kindness,\\" according to Ivanov. Typecasting her as an 'original' (as opposed to 'proto-modern') 'bacchanal character', he wrote: The modern scholar Tatyana Alexandrova (author of Mirra Lokhvitskaya: Doomed to Melt in Flight, 2008) too saw the poet more as mystic seer than 'sultry songstress.' Quoting Lokhvitskaya's short poem (written in 1902, long before even the First Russian revolution): ...she opined that \\"...this poem was in itself a good enough reason for Lokhvitskaya's legacy to remain unpublished in the Soviet times.\\" Lokhvitskaya in 1901 The Silver Age critic Alexander Izmaylov (writing in 1905) rated Lokhvitskaya as the greatest Russian woman poet ever (\\"or, rather, the only one, due to lack of competition\\"). \\"Full of fiery passions, yet occasionally sickly nervous, she entered this world as a strange amalgam of Heaven and Earth, flesh and spirituality, sinfulness and saintly aspirations, lowlife delights and longings for a higher plane, the future Kingdom of Beauty,\\" he wrote. Still, Izmaylov recognized in Lokhvitskaya's poetry a kind of flatness, s narrow-mindedness which was becoming more and more obvious with the years. Mikhail Gershenzon deplored the way Lokhvitskaya has been totally misunderstood by the general readership; only \\"those enchanted by the subtle aromas of poetry, its musicality, easily recognized her exceptional gift.\\" Speaking of the posthumous compilation Before the Sunset (Перед Закатом), he wrote: \\"She could rarely fulfill all of her ideas in one piece, but her poetic designs worked best when she herself wasn't aware of their inner meaning. In the art of bringing individual verses, lines even, to perfection, she had no equal. It looks as if not a single Russian poet has ever come as close as she did to Pushkin's lucid clarity, her verses being easily as catchy.\\" Summarizing Lokhvitskaya's development over the years, Gershenzon wrote: \\"While in her earlier poems there prevailed a 'hurry up, lover, my oil is burning' kind of motif, her latter works documented the process of her soul getting deeper and quieter. As if the moment she spotted this mysterious pattern of things beyond the passions adorning human life's fanciful facade, walls opened wide to let her see through into the unfathomable space.\\" The popularity of Mirra Lokhvitskaya's poetry waned quickly after his death. Igor Severyanin became fascinated with her and even called his fantasy world Mirralliya, but in the 1920s Lokhvitskaya's name slipped into oblivion. Both the Soviet and the Russian immigrant critics labeled the author and her works \\"narrow-minded, trivial, saloon-wise and vulgar.\\" The often quoted words of Valery Bryusov – \\"The future complete anthology of Russian poetry will feature some 10–15 of Lokhvitskaya's truly flawless poems...\\" – were only part of his statement, the second half of which (\\"...but the attentive reader will be forever excited by and engaged in the hidden drama of this poet's soul that has marked the whole of her poetry\\") was invariably omitted. For more than ninety years Lokhvitskaya remained unpublished in her homeland. In the early 1990s things started to change. The Dictionary of Russian Women Writers (1994) admitted that Lokhvitskaya's \\"influence on her contemporaries and on later poets is only beginning to be recognized.\\" The American slavist V. F. Markov called Lokhvitskaya's legacy \\"a treasury of prescience\\", suggesting that it was her and not Akhmatova who \\"taught [Russian] women how to speak.\\" \\"Her poetic world might have been narrow, but shallow – never,\\" biographer Alexandrova asserted. It is just that, according to Vyacheslav Ivanov, this depthness wasn't obvious: \\"the depth of hers was that of a sunlit well, unseen to the untutored eye.\\" In the 2000s several songs based upon the poetry of Mirra Lokhvitskaya were written by Larisa Novoseltseva., , songs by Larisa Novoseltseva on poems by Mirra Lokhvitskaya References Links * Mirra Lokhvitskaya Website (Russian) 1869 births 1905 deaths Russian women poets Russian-language poets Imperial Russian women writers Russian people of French descent Writers from Saint Petersburg Pushkin Prize winners 19th-century Russian women writers 19th-century Russian writers 20th-century Russian women writers 20th-century Russian writers 20th-century Russian poets 19th-century poets Burials at Nikolskoe Cemetery ","title":"Mirra Lokhvitskaya"},{"id":"28968342","text":"Location of the town shown on the map Pinerolo Palaghiaccio is a 2000-seat indoor arena located in Pinerolo, Italy.

He is the Philip Wetton Professor of Astrophysics at Oxford University. His research interests centre on cosmology and how galaxies form and evolve. He has a longstanding interest in astronomical instruments and telescopes and developed the scientific case for the UK's involvement in the 8m Gemini telescopes project. He has pioneered the use of a new class of astronomical spectrograph to measure the masses and ages of galaxies, as well as search for black holes in their nuclei. He is the founding Director of the Oxford Centre for Astrophysical Surveys which is funded by the Hintze Family Charitable Foundation. Early life and education Davies was born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and grew up there, attending John Leggott Grammar School. A school project fired his interest in astronomy, augmented by his parents’ purchase of a small telescope. As a teenager Davies also attended evening classes run by the Workers' Educational Association, becoming a lifelong supporter of astronomy outreach work. Career and research Davies took his first degree in Physics at University College London and his PhD at the Institute of Astronomy and Churchill College, Cambridge. Posts at Lick Observatory, California, then Cambridge and Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, followed. While at Kitt Peak he became part of the Seven Samurai collaboration which surveyed the distances and velocities of 400 nearby elliptical galaxies, discovering the Great Attractor, at that time thought to be pulling the Milky Way and other galaxies in the direction of the constellations of Hydra and Centaurus. Returning to the UK, Davies was based in Oxford leading the team that developed a proposal for UK participation in an 8-m telescope project which ultimately led to the establishment of the Gemini Observatory, twin 8m telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. He became Head of Astronomy at Durham University in 1994 where he developed his interest in integral field spectroscopy and played a leading role in building instruments for Gemini (GMOS)The GMOS Integral Field Unit and the William Herschel Telescope (SAURON). He used these to map the motions and composition of the gas and stars in galaxies leading to new insights into galaxy evolution. Davies returned to Oxford in 2002 as Philip Wetton Professor of Astrophysics (a post he holds in conjunction with a fellowship at Christ Church, Oxford) where he pursues research in cosmology and the evolution of galaxies. He was Head of the Physics Department from 2005-10 and Head of Astrophysics from 2011-14. From 2014 he has been Director of the Oxford Centre for Astrophysical Surveys. As President of the Royal Astronomical Society between 2010 and 2012, Davies worked with the RAS community to make the continued case for astronomy and geophysics, an area in which the UK excels.

The church was given papal endorsement on 30 April 1969, when Pope Paul VI made it a titular church for cardinals. He blessed its fresco on the Feast of the Solemnity of the Mother of God and World Day of Peace, 1970.Cardinal Title S. Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle GCatholic.org The church is referred to as a Centocelle (English: \\"at Centocelle\\") because it located at the site of a former Roman imperial cavalry barracks. It has been the titular church of Philippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle since 24 November 2012, and became pro hac vice suburbicarian when Cardinal Tagle was co-opted to Cardinal Bishop rank in 2020. It has been administered by the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin since 1928. On 10 March 2013, Cardinal Tagle celebrated Holy Mass with members of the Italian-Filipino communities before attending the 2013 papal conclave. History On 14 November 1929, the Italian Marquis Achilles Muti-Bussi donated the land to the Roman Catholic Church as a gesture of goodwill for its impoverished peasants living nearby. The Capuchin friars arrived on 16 December 1930 and on 20 September of the same year the cornerstone was laid for their new Capuchin monastery. On 30 May 1932, the church itself was canonically signed and erected but the actual construction of the church began in 1934. The original church itself was established on 29 March 1935 through the apostolic decree by Vicar General of Rome, Cardinal Francesco Marchetti Selvaggiani in his letter \\"Sollicitudo Omnium Ecclesiarum\\" (English: \\"We encourage the whole church\\"), which canonically entrusted the shrine to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin who tended to the poor slums of the area. The church was formally recognized on 17 October 1935 by the Holy See in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis. Several religious sisters have also joined in the church's charity program throughout the years, such as the Benedictine Nuns (1925), the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (1935) and the Franciscan nuns (1927). The nuns assisted the Capuchin Friars in tending to the poor children, prostitutes and the unemployed. On 1 October 1934, Cardinal Vicar Ugo Poletti drew the exact land measurements and ownership of the parish, which was enacted into civil law on 17 October 1935. The parish complex was designed by Italian architects Mario Paniconi and Ciulio Pediconi. On 2 October 1941, the church was consecrated by Monsignor Luigi Traglia, who was then the titular archbishop of Caesarea in Palestine, and the vice-regent of Rome. The land territory was taken from one of the sub-parishes of Saint Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros and Saint Mary of Good Counsel church. In July 1968, the Vicariate of Rome approved the fresco in the apse of the church featuring Saint Felix of Cantalice, its namesake patron saint made by Father Ugolino from Belluno (born Silvio Alessandri, born 15 December 1919). At the time, the fresco was heavily criticized for its modern architecture, its polychrome colours, the poor natural lighting, and the manner in which it was painted on the wall of 480 square meters. On 1 January 1970, on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, Pope Paul VI blessed the apse of the church in a ceremony televised live by RAI. On 1 May 2020, Pope Francis conceded to Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Prefect for the Evangelization of Peoples the rank of cardinal-bishop making the church a suburbicarian church pro hac vice.  Architecture  The main façade has a polychromed modern painting which depicts Saint Felix of Cantalice in prayer. The church is decorated with works of the Franciscan Belluno Ugolino, which include the Madonna and Child with Saint Felix in the apse and the Appearance of angels and Jesus in a vision of St Francis in the transept. The fresco in the apse features the Madonna as Virgin of the Flowers, wearing a robe of lilies while handing down the Child Jesus to Saint Felix, hooded and prostrate. Below are images of the Jewish children of Terezin who were exterminated by the Nazi authorities, while a newspaper image of Mario Dominici is featured, the boy found dead in the area during World War II as a result of Nazi Anti-Semitism. It also features cherubic angels, and zodiac sign constellations which tell the story of creation. Other scenes of the frescoes involve morality tales, anti-greed and anti-pornographic sentiments, as well as several miraculous scenes from the life of Saint Felix of Cantalice.

The Brazilian red and white tarantula is noted for its white striped legs, beige to grey prosoma, and the reddish hairs on the opisthosoma. Males and females look the same until the ultimate (final) molt of the males. At this point the male will exhibit sexual dimorphism in the form of a duller coloration and legginess. Additionally males will gain an embolus on the pedipalps and tibial apophysis (mating hooks). The Brazilian red and white tarantula is a terrestrial species that will often make a burrow or make use of an abandoned burrow. The Brazilian red and white tarantula is reputed to be quite defensive with its urticating hairs. Habitat The Brazilian red and white tarantula is found in the tropical forests and savannahs of Brazil. Pet trade The Brazilian red and white tarantula is now fairly common in the pet trade, and it is popular among tarantula keepers for its beautiful coloration.

It can also refer to medical parcels and so-called \\"release parcels\\" provided during World War II. The Red Cross arranged them in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention of 1929. During World War II these packages augmented the often- meager and deficient diets in the PoW camps, contributing greatly to prisoner survival and an increase in morale. Modern Red Cross food parcels provide basic food and sanitary needs for persons affected by natural disasters, wars, political upheavals or similar events. More recent catastrophes involving delivery of Red Cross parcels include events in Georgia, Thailand and Great Britain.

The first parcel received by a POW included the following items: *One pound (450 g) tin of corned beef *One pound (450 g) tin of roast beef *One pound (450 g) tin of salmon *Two pounds (900 g) of hash *One pound (450 g) of jam *One bar of soap *Four packages of tobacco *One overshirt *One undershirt *Two cans of pork and beans *One can each of tomatoes, corn and peas *One pair of drawers *Two pairs of socks *Three handkerchiefs *Two towels *One tube of toothpaste *Two pounds (900 g) of hard bread * of evaporated milk *One pound (450 g) of sugar *One- half (225 g) pound of coffee *One toothbrush, comb, shaving brush and \\"housewife\\" kit (sewing kit), plus shaving soap.Carl P. Dennett, Prisoners of the Great War, pg. 28. Thereafter, further parcels were sent once per week. These were rotated on a four-week schedule between packages labeled \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\" and \\"D\\". Each parcel contained meat, fish, vegetable, bread and fruit items, together with eighty cigarettes or other tobacco products.Carl P. Dennett, Prisoners of the Great War, pp. 29-30. The contents of each package are contained in the reference. Items of clothing were also provided for American POWs through the American Red Cross.Carl P. Dennett, Prisoners of the Great War, pp. 30-32. Toward the end of the war, German camp guards and other personnel would sometimes steal the contents of these packages, often leaving only bread for the helpless prisoner. In such events, American camp representatives attempted to make up the loss through stores kept for this purpose in the POW camps.Carl P. Dennett, Prisoners of the Great War, pp. 32-33. A special agreement between the YMCA and the American Red Cross resulted in the YMCA providing athletic equipment, books and games for American prisoners in German POW camps.Carl P. Dennett, Prisoners of the Great War, pp. 52-53. World War II Red Cross food parcels during World War II were mostly provided from the United Kingdom, Canada and America (after 1941). An Allied POW might receive any of these packages at any one given time, regardless of his or her own nationality. This was because all such packages were sent from their country of origin to central collection points, where they were subsequently distributed to Axis POW camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross. For POWs held by Axis forces in Europe the parcel route through Lisbon required escorted ships to bring the crates of parcels, or for British, mail bags full of parcels, to Lisbon, there being no safe conduct agreement. In Portugal, parcels would be loaded onto Red Cross marked ships with many taken through the port of Marseilles, for onward freighting by rail to Geneva, from where they would be sent to various camps by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Barcelona was also used as an Iberian transit port, with Toulon as an alternative French port. The returning ships sometimes carried allied civilians and wounded being repatriated. The route from Iberia to the South of France was not safe. The Red Cross ship SS Padua was damaged by British bombing in Genoa in 1942 and then sunk by a mine outside Marseilles in October 1943. The SS Embla was bombed by British aircraft on 6 April 1944 causing a fire, and the same ship was attacked again on 20 April 1944, by American B-26 bombers, who this time sank the ship and killed the ICRC agent. On 6 May the \\"Christina\\" was attacked while at anchor in Sete. This latest act resulted in the ICRC suspending the route. The Operation Dragoon invasion of Southern France, preliminary bombing in July and the actual invasion in August 1944 put a stop to rail transport and then Marseilles being used by the Red Cross. The SS Vega sailed to the alternative port of Toulon with parcels in November 1944. On 8 May 1945 it was reported that 7,000,000 parcels, weighing were at sea or in warehouses in Britain, Lisbon, Barcelona, Marseilles, Toulon, Geneva and Gothenburg. A Red Cross representative said that they were not perishable and could be used for distressed civilians and as a flexible reserve. =British food parcels= During World War II, The British Joint War Organisation sent standard food parcels, invalid food parcels, medical supplies, educational books and recreational materials to prisoners of war worldwide. During the conflict, over 20 million standard food parcels were sent. Typical contents of such a parcel included: * packet of tea *Tin of cocoa powder *Bar of milk or plain chocolate (often Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut chocolate, or a similar product) *Tinned pudding *Tin of meat roll *Tin of processed cheese *Tin of condensed milk (Klim—a Canadian instant milk beverage—or else Carnation or Nestle brand) *Tin of dried eggs *Tin of sardines or herrings *Tin of preserve *Tin of margarine *Tin of sugar *Tin of vegetables *Tin of biscuits *Bar of soap *Tin of 50 cigarettes or tobacco (sent separately—usually Player's brand cigarettes, or Digger flake pipe tobacco).British Red Cross: Food Parcels.

Approximately 163,000 parcels were made up each week during World War II. Sometimes, due to the shortage of parcels, two or even four prisoners would be compelled to share the contents of one Red Cross parcel. =American food parcels= The American Red Cross produced 27,000,000 parcels. Even before America entered the war in late 1941, they were supplying, through Geneva, parcels to British, Belgian, French, Polish, Yugoslav, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, and Soviet prisoners of war. The Philadelphia centre alone was producing 100,000 parcels a month in 1942. A list of the contents of a typical Red Cross parcel received by an American airman held prisoner in Stalag Luft I near Barth, Germany on the Baltic Sea: * can of powdered milk *One package ten assorted cookies * can of oleo margarine * package of cube sugar * package of Kraft cheese * package of K-ration biscuits * can of coffee *Two D-ration chocolate bars * can of jam or peanut butter * can of salmon or tuna * can of Spam or corned beef * can of Liver paté * package of raisins or prunes *Five packages of cigarettes *Seven Vitamin-C tablets *Two bars of soap * of C-ration vegetable soup concentrate.Eat, Drink, Smoke and Be Creative: Red Cross Parcels. Retrieved on 2010-09-26. According to this airman, recipients of these parcels were permitted to keep only the cigarettes and chocolate bars; the remainder of the parcel was turned over to the camp cook, who combined them with the contents of other parcels and German POW rations (usually bread, barley, potatoes, cabbage and horse meat) to create daily meals for the prisoners. Cigarettes in the parcels became the preferred medium of exchange within the camp, with each individual cigarette valued at 27 cents within Stalag Luft I. Similar practices were followed in other POW camps, as well. Cigarettes were also used to bribe German guards to provide the prisoners with outside items that would otherwise have been unavailable to them. Tins of coffee, which were hard to come by in Germany late in the war, served this same purpose in many camps. Contents of these packages were sometimes pilfered by German guards or other camp personnel, especially toward the end of the war.The Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit. Retrieved 2010-09-26. =Canadian food parcels= The Canadian Red Cross reported assembling and shipping nearly 16,500,000 food parcels during the Second World War, at a cost of $47,529,000. The Canadian Red Cross Prisoners of War Parcels Committee was led by Chairman Harold H. Leather, M.B.E., of Hamilton, Ontario and Vice Chairman John Draper Perrin of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Contents of the Canadian parcel included: * of milk powder * of butter * of cheese * of corned beef * of pork luncheon meat * of salmon * of sardines or kippers * of dried apples * of dried prunes or raisins * of sugar * of jam or honey * of pilot biscuits * of chocolate * of salt and pepper (mustard, onion powder and other condiments were also sometimes enclosed) * of tea or coffee * of soap. Parcels did vary; those delivered to the Channel Islands by the SS Vega in 1945 contained slightly different quantities, both raisins and prunes, and marmalade instead of jam. =New Zealand food parcels= The New Zealand Red Cross Society provided 1,139,624 parcels during the war period, packed by 1,500 volunteers. Prisoners parcels included: * of tea * can of corned mutton * can of lamb and green peas * of chocolate * of butter * of coffee and milk * of sugar * of peas * of jam * of condensed milk * of cheese * of raisins. Unlike the American and British parcels, Canadian and New Zealand Red Cross parcels did not include cigarettes or tobacco. =Indian food parcels= Indian parcels, supplied by the Indian Red Cross Society contained: * fruit in syrup * lentils * toilet soap * flour * 8 biscuits * margarine * Nestle's Milk * rice * pilchard * curry powder * sugar * dried eggs * tea * salt * chocolate Indian parcels did not contain meat or tobacco products. =Argentinian bulk parcel= The Argentinian Red Cross provided parcels containing: * bully beef * meat and veg * ragout * corned mutton * pork and beans * butter * lard * honey * jam * milk jam * condensed milk * sugar * cheese * biscuits * pea and lentil flour * chocolate * cocoa * tea * 1 soap * dried fruit =South African parcels= From the British South African Red Cross. =Invalid Food Parcels= Invalid parcels were specifically designed for invalids, i.e. disabled or ill prisoners. The contents varied, but what appears to be a British one contained: * 2 tins Yeatex * 3 tins concentrated soup powder * 1 tin gooseberries * 1 tin Horlicks * 1 tin Ovaltine * 1 tin milk powder * 2 tins dried eggs * 1 block of chocolate * 1 tin cheese * 1 tin condensed milk * 2 tins compressed oats * tea * 1 tin creamed rice * 1 tin Rowntree's cocoa * 1 tin lemon curd =Food parcels in the Pacific theater= In 1942, permission was granted by Japan for a diplomatically neutral ship, after Japan refused to permit a Red Cross ship to be deployed, to be dispatched to distribute the parcels. A Swedish vessel, the MS Gripsholm delivered 20,000 Red Cross parcels from Canada, America and South Africa and in addition a consignment of 1,000,0000 cigarettes. A second voyage was refused. The Japanese government in August 1942 announced that no neutral ship, even a Red Cross ship, would be allowed to enter Japanese waters. Red Cross parcels intended for Allied PoWs in Japan were accordingly stockpiled in Vladivostok, Soviet Union, and a single ship was ultimately permitted to transport some of these to Japan in November 1944, which, in turn were carried by the Japanese vessel Awa Maru, carrying Red Cross markings, in March, 1945, to Singapore. How many of these actually reached the POWs is not known, and the sinking of the Awa Maru on the return trip by a US submarine prevented any future shipments from being made.The Red Cross in World War II. Retrieved on 2010-09-26. At the Changi prison camp run by the Japanese in Singapore, an average POW received a fraction of one food parcel in the three- and-a half years that the camp was open. =Food parcels in the German Concentration Camps= In November 1943, the Red Cross received permission from Nazi German authorities to send Red Cross parcels to inmates of concentration camps, but only to those whose names and specific locations were known. By May 1945, 105,000 specific individuals had been identified. About 1,112,000 parcels containing 4,500 tons of food were ultimately sent to the camps, including those at Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, Theresienstadt and Auschwitz. In addition to food, these parcels also contained clothing and pharmaceutical items.A Letter from Auschwitz: 1943. Retrieved on 2010-09-28. =German POWs after World War II= Three months after the German surrender in May 1945, General Dwight Eisenhower issued an order classifying all surrendered soldiers within the American Zone of Occupation as Disarmed Enemy Forces, rather than Prisoners of War. Accordingly, the Red Cross was denied the right to visit German POWs in American prison camps, and delivery of Red Cross parcels to them was forbidden.ICRC Commentaries on the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War Article 5 \\"One category of military personnel which was refused the advantages of the Convention in the course of the Second World War comprised German and Japanese troops who fell into enemy hands on the capitulation of their countries in 1945 (6). The German capitulation was both political, involving the dissolution of the Government, and military, whereas the Japanese capitulation was only military. Moreover, the situation was different since Germany was a party to the 1929 Convention and Japan was not. Nevertheless, the German and Japanese troops were considered as surrendered enemy personnel and were deprived of the protection provided by the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. The Allied authorities took the view that unconditional surrender amounted to giving a free hand to the Detaining Powers as to the treatment they might give to military personnel who fell into their hands following the capitulation. In fact, these men were frequently in a very different situation from that of their comrades who had been taken prisoner during the hostilities, since very often they had not even gone into [p.76] action against the enemy. Although on the whole the treatment given to surrendered enemy personnel was fairly favourable, it presented certain disadvantages: prisoners in this category had their personal property impounded without any receipt being given; they had no spokesman to represent them before the Detaining Power; officers received no pay and other ranks, although compelled to work, got no wages; in any penal proceedings they had the benefit of none of the guarantees provided by the Convention. Most important of all, these men had no legal status and were at the entire mercy of the victor. Fortunately, they were well treated but this is no reason to overlook the fact that they were deprived of any status and all guarantees.\\" In the spring of 1946 the International Red Cross was finally allowed to provide limited amounts of food aid to prisoners of war in the U.S. occupation zone.ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands International Red Cross 2 February 2005 =Postwar study on Red Cross parcels and Canadian PoWs= The Canadian government conducted a detailed study of the effect of the Red Cross parcels on the health and morale of Canadian POWs shortly after the end of World War II. Over 5,000 former POWs were interviewed, and Canadian authorities determined that a significant number of soldiers did not get the intended one parcel per man per week; most had to make do with one-half of a parcel per week, or even less on some occasions. Soldiers were asked to state their preferences with regard to specific contents of the parcels: the most popular item turned out to be the biscuits, with butter a close second, followed (in order) by meat, milk (powdered and other), chocolate, cigarettes, tea, jam, cereals, cheese and coffee. The Canadian parcel was preferred to British, American or New Zealand-issued parcels, claiming that the Canadian parcels had \\"greater bulk\\", \\"lasted longer\\", and/or had \\"more food\\". With regard to especially disliked foods, the Canadian respondents (over 4,200 of the interviewed POWs) expressed the greatest distaste for the vegetables and fish enclosed in the food parcels (about fifteen percent of the total number of respondents), followed (in order) by condiments, egg powder, cereals, fat, cheese, desserts, sweets, beverages, jams, biscuits and milk. However, except for the first two items on that list, all of these were named by only a minuscule percentage of the total number of respondents. =Parcels from Red Cross organisations in occupied countries= * Belgium sent parcels to their PoWs and in addition, family members could send parcels. * Denmark sent parcels to Danish citizens incarcerated in Nazi concentration camps. * France sent parcels to their POWs and in addition, family members could send parcels. Red Cross medical kits =American= A second type of parcel delivered through the Red Cross during World War II was the Red Cross Prisoner of War First Aid Safety Kit, which was supplied by the American Red Cross for distribution through the International Committee. Such parcels generally held the following items: *A twelve-page booklet with instructions on the use of the enclosed medical supplies, printed in English, French, German, Polish and Serbo-Croatian *Ten packages of sterilised gauze, in two different sizes *One package containing 500 laxative pills *Two packages containing 500 aspirin tablets each *Twelve gauze bandages *Two cans of insecticide powder *Four tubes of boric acid antiseptic ointment *Two packages containing 500 sodium bicarbonate tablets each *Two tubes of Salicylic ointment (for treatment of athlete's foot and similar fungal diseases) *Two tubes of Mercuric antiseptic ointment *Four tubes of sulphur ointment (for treatment of skin diseases) *One box containing 100 Band-Aids *Two rolls of adhesive tape *Two packages of absorbent cotton *Safety pins, forceps, soap, disinfectants and scissors.

See kit mentioned as being provided by Parke, Davis and Co. Retrieved 2010-09-26. =British= The British Red Cross also supplied Medical Parcels to Allied PoWs during the war. Prior to 15 June 1942 these kits generally consisted of: *A general parcel containing cotton wool, safety pins, soap, aspirin tablets and ointment *A disinfectant parcel *Special parcels containing thermometers and dressing scissors. After 15 June 1942 the British kits' contents changed. The new kits contained: *An invalid food unit consisting of two parcels – milk and food *A medical stores unit consisting of four parcels: ::\\"Medical 1\\" contained soap and disinfectant ::\\"Medical 2\\" contained sodium bicarbonate, Dover's powder, lung balsam, ferric subsulfate solution, zinc ointment, cascara, zinc oxide powder, formalin throat tablets, ammoniated mercury ointment, flexoplast, lint, cotton wool, gauze, Vitamin-C tablets, pile ointment, sulphapyridine tablets, magnesium trisilicate, and oxide plaster ::\\"Medical 3 and 4\\" contained additional quantities of the supplies found in \\"Medical 2\\", adding to them kaoline poultice, Vitamin A and Vitamin D tablets, TCP (antiseptic), aspirin, Bemax, sulphanilamide and toilet paper.British Red Cross Medical Supplies.

It is not abstract learning rather it is concrete skills. It is also described as a type of education that creates competencies needed for improved productivity and focuses on outcomes as well as the learners' real-world performance. It represents a set of competencies that define core work practices and standards that are consistent with levels defined within the National and Regional/International qualifications framework.  Concept  A general conceptualization of competency-based learning describes this education as an ongoing sequence of particular interactions that are systematically designed to approach and approximate performance standards. Competency-based education differs from other non- related approaches in that the unit of learning is extremely fine-grained. Rather than a course or a module, every individual skill or learning outcome (known as a competency) is one single unit. Learners work on one competency at a time, which is likely a small component of a larger learning goal. The student is evaluated on the individual competency and can only move on to other competencies after they have mastered the current skill being learned. After that, higher or more complex competencies are learned to a degree of mastery and are isolated from other topics. Another common component of competency-based learning is the ability to skip learning modules entirely if the learner can demonstrate mastery. This can be determined through prior learning assessment or formative testing. To demonstrate using a real-life scenario: people learning to drive manual transmission might first have to demonstrate their mastery on the \\"rules of the road,\\" safety, defensive driving, parallel parking, etc. In this manner, they can focus on two independent competencies – \\"using the clutch, brake with right foot\\" and \\"shifting up and down through the gears.\\" Once the learners have demonstrated that they are comfortable with those two skills, the next overarching skill that needs to be learned might be \\"finding first: from full stop to a slow roll\\" followed by \\"sudden stops,\\" \\"shifting up\\" and \\"down shifting.\\" Because this is kinesthetic learning, the instructor likely would demonstrate the skill to the learner a few times after which the student can perform guided practice followed by independent practice until mastery is demonstrated.  Methodology  Competency-based learning is learnerfocused and works naturally with independent study and with the instructor in the role of facilitator. In this model, the instructor is also required to identify specific learning outcomes in terms of behavior and performance, including the appropriate criterion level to be used in evaluating achievement. Experiential learning is also the underpinning theory of learning in the design of assessment of prior learning and the curriculum to be used. The methodology of competency-based learning recognizes that learners tend to find some individual skills more difficult than others. For this reason, the learning process allows a student to learn more challenging individual skills at their own pace, practising and refining as much as they like. The learner can then move to other skills to which they are more adept. While most other learning methods use summative testing, competency-based learning requires mastery of every individual learning outcome, making it very well suited to learning credentials in which safety is an issue. With summative testing, a student who got 80% in the evaluation may have an 80% mastery of all learning outcomes or may have no mastery what-so-ever of 20% of the learning outcomes. Further, this student may be permitted to move on to higher learning and still be missing some abilities that are crucial to that higher learning. For example, a student who knows most traffic laws and has mostly mastered controlling a vehicle could be treated equally with a student who has mastered vehicle control but no understanding of traffic laws, but only one of these students will be permitted to drive. What it means to have mastered a competency depends on the learning domain (subject matter). In a subject matter that could affect safety, it would be usual to expect complete learning that can be repeated every time. In abstract learning, such as algebra, the learner may only have to demonstrate that they can identify an appropriate formula, for example, 4 of 5 times since when using that skill in the next competency, resolving a formula, will usually allow an opportunity for the learner to discover and correct his/her mistakes.Gene E. Hall (1976) Competency-based Education: A Process for the Improvement of Education: Prentice-HallJohn Burke (1989) Competency-Based Education and Training: Routledge It is important to understand that this learning methodology is common in many kinetic and/or skills-based learning and is also sometimes applied to abstract and/or academic learning for students who find themselves out-of-step with their grade, course or program of study. Increasingly, educational institutions are evaluating ways to include competency-based learning methodologies in many different types of programs in order to make learning success a constant while students' pace can vary. Best practices Competency profiles assist in effective learning and development by identifying the behaviors, knowledge, skills and abilities that are necessary for successful performance in a job. The efficacy of competency models depends on the specific definition of the scope of skills expected of the learner or employee being trained. Employees can assess their competencies against those required for their own job, or for another job in which they are interested, and then take steps to acquire or improve any necessary competencies. Competencies support learning by: * Focusing learning on the critical competencies needed for success in the job and organization * Providing standards for measuring employee performance and capabilities * Providing the framework for identifying learning options/curriculum/programs to meet employee and organizational needs * Supporting effective forecasting of organizational, as well as project-related learning requirements * Providing standards for determining how well learning has occurred, both at the individual and organizational level = Assessment = Experts cite that assessment is an important criteria in ensuring success and best practice in competency-based models. To effectively determine a framework for quality, the following characteristics are required: * The assessment criteria, including benchmarks for evidence and post-assessment feedback, is accepted by all stakeholders; * For students, the resemblance to a competency-based assessment for future workplace is authentic; * Cognitive complexity or the extent to which thinking skills are part of the competency standards; * Consistency of assessment; * Cost efficiency or the comparability of the resources needed for the assessment to the benefits; * The assessment program yields positive effects; * Fairness in terms of the opportunity given to candidates to demonstrate their competency; * Fitness for purpose; and, * Transparency. Other common benchmark competency-based practices in learning and development are: * Assessments against competencies – Once the competencies have been defined for particular job / roles, it becomes possible for employees and others to assess the employee's competencies against those required for current or future roles within the organization. This assessment can occur in the following ways: **Self-assessment – Typically, the behavioral indicators for the competencies and proficiency levels needed within the target role / job are used as the standard for assessing the performance of the employee using a common rating scale (e.g., five-point Likert scale) for assessing each indicator. These behavioral examples ensure people self-assess consistently and accurately. They create self-awareness, which drives intrinsic motivation to improve. The results show employee strengths as well as skill gaps. This information can then be used to support the development of an individual learning plan. **Multi-source / 360 – Multi-source or 360-degree feedback is similar to the self-assessment process except there is more than one assessor. The process includes at a minimum the employee and their supervisor, and can include others with whom the employee interacts within the workplace (e.g., peers, team members, clients both within and outside the organization, reporting employees; etc.). Implementation stages The following implementation stages are suggested for organizations implementing competencies in Learning and Development on a corporate-wide basis. =Stage 1= * Determine policy for integrating competencies in Learning and Development. * Design or acquire tools to support assessment and personalized, competency-based learning. * Build/buy/curate learning activities that correspond to each task and behavior in the competency model. Ensure these also include informal learning resources, such as skill practices or activities, job aids, checklists, templates, performance support tutorials, as well as the opportunity to work with others for collaborative learning. This facilitates learning in the flow of work. * Create a plan for introduction, embedding, and sustaining the program. *Have people assess, be recommended personalized competency-based learning, and create their development plans. Engage managers or multi-raters to participate if relevant. =Stage 2= * Use aggregated assessment results and development plan selections to identify organizational skill gaps and needs assessment. *Engage leaders in results regularly so they understand how skill gaps impact their ability to achieve corporate strategy, and how strong organizational capability can be leveraged for competitive advantage. *Continue emphasis through communication and change management on creating a habit of learning, so development activity continues. *Identify new learning opportunities, including those that need to be created to support gaps, or activities to replace those with lower than desired user feedback. * Ensure periodic reassessments occur; measure the impact of competency-based skill development over time. * Make regular improvements in communication. *At least annually, revisit the competency model and competency-based learning recommendations to ensure currency. =Schools with this system= Adams county school district 50 and the Chugach School District are a part of the Competency-based learning project but have their own name called Re-Inventing schools coalition (RISC). They have replaced grade levels with 10 learning levels that students work through at their own pace. Western Governors University (WGU), has used this model of learning since it was chartered in 1996. Other institutions are also offering competency-based approaches to postsecondary degrees. Capella University's FlexPath bachelor's and master's programs were the second direct assessment degree to be given the go-ahead by the Department of Education. Southern New Hampshire University developed a competency-based pathway to an associate or bachelor's degree through College for America, launched in 2013. Additionally, the University of Wisconsin-Extension's Flex Option provides a competency-based approach to earning a bachelor's degree. Since 1971, the Upper Valley Educator's Institute in Lebanon, NH has offered a teacher certification program that is competency based, and now offers a competency based Master in Arts in Teaching (MAT).  In medical practice  A series of peer reviewed research articles (i.e. Charles; Knox; Nguyen; Nousiainen et al) have been examined that study Canadian based medical residency programs, that have implemented competency based learning as their primary model of education. These articles agree that competency based learning speaks to an iterative approach in that the student (resident) is expected to complete one competence successfully before advancing forward and building their repertoire of skills (Charles et al., 2016). This method of learning is tailored to each student as it allows learning to unfold at an individual's own pace, which has appeared to be a successful model for many residency programs across Canada.

She started with the short feature film Die Ordnung der Dinge (The order of things), for which she won the European Short Film Award in Berlin 1987. One year after Buch directed a 45-minute feature film Tod eines Idioten (Death of a fool) that was co- produced with the Bavarian Television. Her graduation film Die ungewisse Lage des Paradieses (The uncertain situation of paradise) is a children's film that shows a girl escaping from reality into a bizarre dreamworld. It was shown in cinemas in 1993 and is to be seen as her debut feature film. Since 1991, Buch has worked as a freelance author and director. From 1993-1994, Buch was a fellowship-holder at the Screenplay Workshop Munich. She wrote several screenplays for the TV crime series O.K. (1993/1994, Bavaria Film) and Faust (1994/1995, ZDF). At the same time, she completed the 45-minute TV film essay on the life and work of Else Lasker-Schueler, Mein Herz - Niemandem (1994). =1999-2004= Finally she manages the breakthrough with Verschwinde von hier (Disappear out of here) in 1999. The film is about a young man caring affectionately about his partner's son because he is neglected by his mother. The film won the Max-Ophuels Prize in the category \\"Best Movie\\" as well as the German Film Award for the best screenplay in 2000. In her further children's and family's movies she continues focussing on the issue of family that is often described from the children's perspectives: The literature filmings of Erich Kästner's Emil and the Detectives (2001) and Das fliegende Klassenzimmer (2002) (The flying classroom) as well as the comedy Unsere Mutter ist halt anders (2003) (Our Mother is just different) were published.

She directs high-quality children, youth and family films such as Heimliche Liebe - Der Schüler und die Postbotin (2005) (Secret Love - The student and the postwoman) about a boy that falls in love with an older woman while he is on holiday and Patchwork (2008) about two single parents and their attempt to found a family with their kids. Buch's next cinema feature Hier kommt Lola! (Here comes Lola!) was published in 2010. Similarly to her debut film Die ungewisse Lage des Paradieses (1992) the story is about a girl handling with her problems and fears by escaping into a fantasy world.

The pink building in the middle is the Palazzo Barbarigo Minotto. The Palazzo Barbarigo Minotto (also called Palazzo Minotto Barbarigo) is a 15th-century palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, northern Italy, next to the much larger Palazzo Corner.Jan-Christoph Rößler. Palazzo Minotto Barbarigo, Palazzi veneziani - architettura a Venezia Built in the Venetian Gothic style, it was originally two palaces, Palazzo Barbarigo and Palazzo Minotto, later joined together. The Barbarigo palace was owned by the Barbarigo family for several centuries and was the birthplace of Gregorio Barbarigo, who once refused the Papal Crown.Douglas, Hugh A., Venice on Foot, originally published in 1925 by Methuen and re-published in facsimile by READ BOOKS, 2008, p. 277. It was later owned by the Minotto and Martinengo families. The facade of Palazzo Barbarigo-Minotto on the Grand Canal of Venice. Three staterooms face the Grand Canal and another three face Rio Zaguri. In the first half of the 18th century frescoes and paintings by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Francesco Fontebasso and Carpoforo Tencalla were commissioned by Pietro Barbarigo. Its chapel has Louis XIV Style elm flooring inlaid with olive-root marquetry. The palace's doors, are in the same style, banded in walnut with bronze handles shaped as vine leaves. The floors of the staterooms are a blend of terrazzo paving and Venetian \\"pastellone\\" paving. Description The so-called \\"Tiepolo's Room\\", almost entirely decorated by the Venetian Master. The palace is actually formed by two different buildings, merged in the 17th century. The ancient part, a 15th-century Venetian-Gothic architecture featuring 12th century Byzantine friezes, was originally known as Palazzo Minotto; the newer part, Palazzo Barbarigo, was built in the 17th century. On the occasion of Gregorio Barbarigo's marriage with the keen and cultured Caterina Sagredo, in 1739, the greatest artists of the time were called to embellish the palace in both its parts, which had been unified by then. Among these the great master Gianbattista Tiepolo, Francesco Fontebasso, Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna, and Carpoforo Mazzetti. In 1741 was hired the Ferrarese quadraturist Mengozzi Colonna, who painted the domestic chapel located in a recess of the building and hidden by two wooden leaves. Around it a Louis XIV elm flooring inlaid with olive-root and other prized wood marquetry. The following year Mengozzi Colonna intervenes also on the central hall (portego) designing the beautiful Venetian terrazzo pavings. The palace's doors are Louis XIV style, banded in walnut and with bronze handles shaped as vine leaves. Gianbattista Tiepolo started his work here in 1741, painting the monochromes and two of the overdoors that frame the central canvas, \\"The triumph of Virtue and Nobility over Ignorance\\". The original oil painting is now part of Cà Rezzonico's collection and has been replaced here with a 20th-century copy. The 20th century copy of Tiepolo's \\"Triumph of Virtue over Ignorance\\" (1745), oil on canvas. The original painting is now part of Cà Rezzonico's collection. The whole pictorial decoration represents the cultural interests of Gregorio and Caterina, freshly married. Four monochromes represent Sciences: History, Astronomy, Geography and Astrology. The other four, with mixtilinear framings represent the Arts: Painting, Sculpture, Music and Poetry. The frescoes in the overdoors depict Merit and Abundance. This whole cycle is influenced by the neoclassical trend that conquered the whole city during that period, through its ornamental motives, ancient-looking sculptures, sarcophagi, amphorae and vases, together with the \\"Olympic grace\\" of its figures. The parlor is also known as \\"the room of Wisdom\\", since it exalts the commissioner's idea of the arts and sciences giving wealth and nobility. The central oil on canvas was painted by Tiepolo in 1744-1745. Next to the two female figures representing Virtue and Nobility there is a young page holding a drape of their vest: it is probably a portrait of the painter's son, Giuseppe Maria. Behind him we notice another figure, supposedly a self-portrait of the artist himself. Ignorance, defeated, falls down dragging with her a winged genie who is holding a bat, allegory of Vice. This celebrative representation, dear to the masters of the house, is also an example of Tiepolo's artistic maturity, highly influenced by Veronese models. Carpoforo Mazzetti, pupil of another Ticinese artist, Abbondio Stazio, molded the stuccos in the rocaille style alcove. The decorations originate from the central opening where the bed is placed, branching out on both sides to reach the doors, adorned with mirrors. Above them, the crest and its shield-carrying angels overlook the room. The Alcove with its rich stuccos, photographed during a performance of Verdi's \\"Traviata\\", by the ensemble of \\"Musica a Palazzo\\". Mazzetti worked also on the dining room's stuccos, where he represented mythological scenes in pale colours and very realistic and colourful animals to adorn the ceiling. Musica a Palazzo, a cultural association of classical musicians, has leased the piano nobile since 2005 and uses it for small-scale opera productions.Bing, Alison, Venice Encounter, Lonely Planet, 2009, p. 56. See also The Barbarigo family owned several other palaces in Venice which still bear their name, most notably the Palazzo Barbarigo. The others are Palazzo Barbarigo alla Maddalena, Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza, and Palazzo Barbarigo Nani Mocenigo.

Facial Justice is a dystopian novel by L. P. Hartley, published in 1960. The novel depicts a post- apocalyptic society that has sought to banish privilege and envy, to the extent that people will even have their faces surgically altered in order to appear neither too beautiful nor too ugly. The novel was included in Anthony Burgess' essay Ninety-nine Novels. Plot summary After a devastating nuclear war, the surviving people of Earth have been forced to live in caverns, ruled by harsh dictatorships. In Britain an unseen leader inspires a large section of the populace to escape the caverns and forms a new dictatorship above ground. This new society is based on a collective sense of guilt at the events of the nuclear war. All subjects are named after famous murderers from history, and are obliged to wear sackcloth so as not to provoke envy with their appearance. The Dictator is never seen, but his voice is broadcast to his subjects regularly, instructing them on the laws and morals of his society. His rule is enforced by Inspectors, who have the power to fine people for minor infringements or report them to the higher ministries for further punishment. A young woman named Jael 97, who has been reported to the Ministry of Facial Justice for being \\"facially over privileged\\" and causing discontent among other women, approaches the Equalisation (Faces) Centre to have a synthetic \\"Beta\\" face fitted so that she will blend in with the community. At the urging of a friend, however, she decides to put this off. Her resultant guilt, along with subsequent events—her forbidden delight at the idea of \\"height\\" during an excursion to the ruined tower of Ely Cathedral; her injury in a planned motor-coach accident during her return from the excursion; her rescue by the Inspector Michael, with whom she falls in love; and her involuntary \\"Betafication\\" at the hospital to which she is taken—provokes her rebellious spirit, and she forms a resistance group whose aim is to undermine the regime and show it up as ridiculous. She also writes articles in magazines and papers, in which she deliberately stretches the rules of society to ridiculous proportions—suggesting, for instance, that spelling and grammatical errors in writing should not be criticised, as this can lead to envy and bitterness between people. From the doctor who Betafied her (and who desires her), Jael manages to find out that he has also treated the Dictator and that the Dictator's chest bears a heart-shaped birthmark. In her desire to find and kill the Dictator, she writes an article urging that anyone should be able to challenge another person on the street to bare their chest and prove they have no birthmarks. This is, she claims, to ensure that everyone is as alike as possible. The idea proves divisive amongst the public and begins to cause a great deal of public disorder. Rioting breaks out on the streets, and in the absence of any advice from the Dictator, the public turn on him and denounce him. The Dictator finally responds by announcing that he can see that the public no longer appreciate his leadership and protection and, therefore, he will be leaving. The country descends into chaos after the Dictator's departure. Further rioting ensues, and food supplies are exhausted as the means of production are abandoned or destroyed. The remaining government officials realise they will have to ask the underground dictatorships for food supplies. The leaders of the underground society agree to help, but demand that in return six people be sent to them, presumably to be executed. Jael, out of a sense of guilt at her role in the collapse of society, decides to volunteer to be one of the people sent underground. On the night before she intends to so offer herself, she remains awake to savour her last few hours above ground. Then, amidst sounds of a rainstorm outside, there is a knock at her door, which she opens to reveal an old lady who had been kind to her when she was hospitalised, clearly weak with hunger and soaked from heavy rain. Jael lets her into her home and offers her some clothes to change into. To Jael's astonishment, she finds that the lady bears the Dictator's birthmark and is, in fact, the Dictator. Clearly on the verge of death, the lady reveals that Michael (who has also arrived on the scene) has acted as her \\"voice\\" in the Dictator's announcements. She also begs Jael to take on the role of Dictator and restore order and hope to the people. The novel ends with Jael, seemingly having accepted the offer from the Dictator, starting to address the public, through Michael's voice, for the first time. Reception Anthony Burgess included Facial Justice in Ninety-nine Novels, his selection of best novels in the English language since 1939. Burgess described the novel as \\"A brilliant projection of tendencies apparent in the post-war British welfare state ... Hartley was a fine writer with a strong moral sense\\". The Times was equally lavish in its praise, describing Hartley's vision in the novel as \\"a brilliantly witty survey of certain contemporary trends and weaknesses\\". Galaxy's Floyd C. Gale rated Facial Justice 3.5 stars. He described the novel as \\"learned, thoughtful and provocative\\" despite being \\"short on drama and long on talk.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy, February 1962, p.192.

Integrating competencies within the performance management process supports the provision of feedback to employees not only on \\"what\\" they have accomplished (i.e., performance goals), but also \\"how\\" the work was performed, using competencies for providing feedback. Assessing competencies as a part of performance management is an important means of assisting employees in understanding performance expectations and enhancing competencies. Multi-source feedback, while not an HR application per se, is a method that is often used in performance management to assess and provide employees with feedback on \\"how\\" they performed their work (i.e., their demonstration of the competencies).competency Best practices =Performance management= Performance management programs are set up to provide feedback to employees on how effectively they are performing in their jobs. Such programs normally include a set of goals or objectives the employee must accomplish within the review period as well as the standards or criteria for determining whether the defined goals have been accomplished. Effective performance management include the following features: * Linking individual goals to the corporate and work unit business plans and goals; * Focusing on results, behaviours (competencies) as well as process improvement; * Regular reviews and updating of performance plans to address changing demands; * Training for both managers and employees on how to effectively give and receive feedback, including providing feedback to employees who experience challenges in performing to the standards required in their jobs / roles; * Training for managers on how to provide performance evaluations that are valid, fair and unbiased. Integrating competencies in the performance management (PM)(Shet,Patil,Chandavarkar,2019) process in one of two ways: * By defining the competencies needed to perform each Performance Goal / Objective In this case, the manager and employee identify the key competencies required to achieve each performance goal / objective (typically 1 to 3 competencies per goal/objective). At the end of the performance cycle, the employee's performance is evaluated in relation to the performance goals/objectives as well as the key competencies associated with each goal. Using this approach, the competencies included in the employee's performance plan may or may not completely coincide with the standard competency profile for the employee's role/job. The advantage of using this method is that the competencies being assessed are entirely consistent with the employee's performance goals for the performance review cycle. The disadvantage is that not all competencies within the competency profile for the employee's role/job will necessarily be assessed within the cycle. * By integrating the competencies for the employee's job into the PM process In this case, the performance plan includes the performance goals/objectives for the review period as well as the complete set of competencies from the competency profile for the employee's role/job. The performance goals/objectives address \\"what\\" must be accomplished during the review period, and the competencies measure \\"how\\" the employee conducted him/herself to accomplish their work. The advantage of this method is that all competencies defined in the competency profile for the employee's role/job are evaluated. The disadvantage is that due to the specific nature of the performance goals/objectives, key competencies for the effective performance during the review cycle, but not included in the competency profile, will not be assessed. In both cases, feedback provided on the employee's competencies typically feeds into the development of a learning or action plan to address gaps in performance and development within or beyond the employee's current role/job. =Multi-source/360-degree/upward feedback= In multi-source, 360-degree and upward feedback, the behavioural indicators for the competencies needed within the target role/job are used as the standard for assessing the performance of the employee. In Multi-source / 360 feedback, different stakeholder groups provide ratings, including the employee, their supervisor, as well as others with whom the employee interacts (e.g., peers, team members, clients both within and outside the organization, reporting employees; etc.). In upward feedback, all employees reporting directly and/or indirectly to the supervisor provide feedback on the supervisor's performance. The results are compiled and a report is provided to the employee. The report includes the results for all competencies, highlighting both the competencies that are strong as well as those rated lowest by the different stakeholder groups. In almost all cases, individual ratings from others (except for the employee's supervisor) are combined in such a way (e.g., averaged ratings) as to protect the anonymity of the individuals providing the feedback. The report is set up to show similarities and differences in ratings across the different stakeholder groups. The results of the process are normally used to develop learning and action plans for improvement (see section on Learning and Development). They can also feed into broader assessment programs (e.g., management assessment centres; development programs) to support employee career development and / or succession management within the organization. Upward and multi-source/360 degree feedback programs must be managed well in order to protect those providing, as well as those receiving, feedback. The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology has published guidelines for the effective development and implementation of multi-source feedback. Implementation stages The following implementation stages are suggested for mid to large organizations implementing competencies within Performance Management on a corporate-wide basis =Stage 1= * Determine policy for integrating competencies within the Performance Management process * Design a Performance Management process consistent with the policy (as required) * Design communications and training program to support implementation * Pilot the process * Revise and finalize ready for full implementation =Stage 2= * Communicate and implement the Performance Management process * Review and evaluate the process during the first cycle of implementation (e.g., first year) and make revisions, as required.

James William \\"Jimi\\" HeseldenJimi Heselden: Miner who used his redundancy money to become a businessman and philanthropist, The Independent Obituary, 2 October 2010. OBE (27 March 1948 – 26 September 2010) was a British entrepreneur. A former coal miner, Heselden became wealthy by manufacturing the Hesco bastion barrier system. In 2010, he bought Segway Inc., maker of the Segway personal transport system. Heselden died in 2010 from injuries apparently sustained falling from a cliff while riding his own product. His estate, bequeathed to his widow and family, was worth over £340 million and he was ranked in the top 400 members of the Sunday Times Rich List. Early life Heselden grew up in the Halton Moor district of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. At the age of 15, Heselden left Osmondthorpe Secondary Modern School to work as a labourer and then at collieries in Temple Newsam and Lofthouse. He lost his job in the wave of redundancies that followed the 1984–85 miners' strike and spent his redundancy money on renting a workshop and, at first, setting up a sandblasting business. He then worked on developing and patenting a collapsible wire mesh and fabric container, now called Hesco bastion, to be used for building flood management and to limit erosion. Career In 1989, Heselden founded Hesco Bastion Ltd to manufacture containers of the same name; filled with sand or earth, they quickly found favour with the armies of several countries, as they allowed effective blast walls, barriers and revetments to be quickly constructed. Made in Hesco's factory in Leeds, these were shipped (flat-packed) in great numbers to conflict zones, including Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as later being used for flood defences at New Orleans. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours, \\"for services to the Defence industry and to Charity.\\" Philanthropy In 2008, Heselden donated £1.5 million to the Help For Heroes fund through a charity auction bid for nine people to fly with the Red Arrows and, in the same year, set up the Hesco Bastion Fund in his home city with a £10 million donation to the Leeds Community Foundation. A further £3 million was added to the foundation in 2009 and an additional £10 million in 2010. Heselden has said, \\"There are people out there who are making money and when times are good I honestly believe people have a moral obligation to use their wealth to help others.\\" Death On the morning of 26 September 2010, Heselden was killed when he fell from a cliff footpath into the River Wharfe, at the village of Thorp Arch near Boston Spa; a Segway vehicle was found near him. The West Yorkshire Coroner concluded that Heselden had died accidentally, and that he had probably \\"got into difficulty\\" when he reversed his vehicle to allow a man walking his dog to pass.

It is the largest castle (in terms of area) from all Czech castles. Its name might derive from the German word raben (\\"raven\\"), or it could be mangled Czech name (\\"sparrow's peak\\").Czech scholar Michal Novák points that one possible explanation would be that the name probably stems from the German word raben, which means \\"raven\\", or it could also suggest something like \\"Raven's Peak\\". Another explanation lies in the expression Rabiri, vernacular form of \\"gold-surveyors\\", and a third that might be a derivation from , a bird's name. Rabí Castle was proclaimed a National Cultural Monument in 1978. History The first mention of Rábí Castle dates from 1380, although it is not known exactly when it was founded. It is likely that the Lords of Velhartice established it after 1300 to protect trade routes along the Otava and also to inspect gold-bearing deposits in it. Novak points out a theory which suggests that the castle was commissioned by Bavarian princes when the whole Sušice region was under Bavarian rule, although earlier opposing views state that the castle was only built in the 14th century, constructed by the Lords of Velhartice who had estates nearby. They built a strong palace, ramparts and a keep. Subsequent owners, the Švihovský of Rýzmburk family, continued building work and built the outer ward and two square towers. At the start of the Hussite rebellions, the Švihovský family searched for havens of supporters of the Catholic side in the district and for their treasures, at Rábí. In 1420–21, the Hussites conquered the castle twice,PetrDavid, Vladimír Soukup, Lubomír Čech, Wonders of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, Euromedia Group, p. 110. and legend has it that during the second siege an arrow fired from crossbow hit the trunk of a pear tree and a resulting splinter from the tree hit Jan Žižka in his only good eye.Kohl, Johann Georg (2008), Austria, Vienna, Hungary, Bohemia and the Danube, Galicia, Styria, Moravia, and the Military Frontier, Kessinger Publishing, LLC. p. 74. In 1479, the provincial governor Půta Švihovský of Rýzmberk became the owner of the estate and began with a thoughtful remodelling of the castle under the guidance of famous master Benedict Rejt. New living quarters and service buildings were constructed, the castle was enlarged and the fortifications heightened. Rabí Castle was, from the very start, envisioned as a donjon-type castle. It was built in the form of three separate sections, constructed in tiers above each other. The ramparts were up to wide, and had bastions, vallum fortifications and moats. However, building activity exhausted the Švihovský family's finances and the fortifications remained incomplete. Rabí Castle in 1708 Many alchemical experiences took place during Půta's time as well; a German alchemist who failed to transform lead into gold was then imprisoned in the castle's massive prismatic tower. Půta had three nannies walled-in alive for turning his wife against his brothers. His son later sold the estate in 1549, but the new owners did not invest in the castle. Instead they made use exclusively of the existing original buildings. The following owners, the House of Chanov, from Dlouhá Ves, bought the castle in 1570. The slowly deteriorating complex was completely devastated during the Thirty Years' War, when Mansfeld's soldiers went on the rampage. Emperor Ferdinand III ordered that the castle should have been destroyed after 1650.Ehrenberger, Tomaš (2003), The 88 Most Beautiful Castles, Kartografie Praha a.s., pp. 116. In the end it was saved, but on the condition that it was not to be repaired. In time it became a source of building material for local peasants. The last owners, the Lamberk family (from 1708) donated the castle to the Horažďovice Society for the Preservation of Artistic, Cultural and Natural Monuments for a symbolic price of 1 Kč in 1920, and after 1945 it was taken by the Czechoslovak State.

Many organizations are experiencing difficulty keeping their organizations fully staffed with qualified resources, and organizations world-wide are realizing the importance of putting in place programs and initiatives to attract well-qualified workers and retain them once have been hired. These trends underscore the importance of career development and succession management initiatives aimed at preparing employees for increasing responsibilities within their organizations. Best Practices =Career Development and Succession Management Defined= Career Development traditionally has been driven primarily by employees. Organizations provide the frameworks, tools and processes, but the responsibility rests with employees to take advantage of these to advance in their careers. Succession Management, on the other hand, has traditionally been management driven. Key roles are identified, and ranked lists of suitable candidates are prepared based on their existing competencies and / or potential to perform in the targeted roles or levels. Potential to perform can be identified in a number of ways: past performance in career track positions; supervisory assessments of potential; standardized assessment programs (e.g., assessment centres); etc. The lists are used to appoint candidates as positions become available. More recently, however, the lines between the traditional concepts of Career Development and Succession Planning have blurred. Organizations are instituting development programs that allow employees to progress through a phased program of development aimed at increasing employee competencies and preparing them to take on increased responsibility. These programs typically include: formalized in-class training; planned work assignments; assessments at key stages; and, “gradation” defined through some form of assessment or certification, and / or appointment to targeted roles or levels. =Basic Competency Architecture Requirements= Establishing effective career development and succession management programs starts at the planning stage by: * Defining the Competency Architecture - Competency dictionaries and competency architectures are established that allow employees and managers to compare and contrast competency requirements across roles and levels within or across job groups. * Defining Career Streams and Roles - Beyond this, typical roles and career streams within the group to be profiled are defined. This allows both managers and employees to see how progression typically occurs. It also allows the organization to develop career development and succession management programs, tools and processes that support progression. =Competency-based Tools and Processes= Career Development and Succession Management typically include a selection of competency-based elements that address the requirements of the job group: * career stream information provided in a number of formats (e.g., intranet; orientation programs; guidebooks; etc.); * employee guides to support self-directed development or participation in a planned program; * learning resource catalogues organized by competency (see Learning and Development section); * training for both managers and employees on how the program works and how to gain the maximum benefit; * self-assessment or multi- source assessment to evaluate progress in development (see Learning and Development and Performance Management sections); * formal in-class training; * e-learning elements; * work assignments or action learning exercises aimed at developing skill (see Learning and Development section); * supervisory (or other) assessment of performance in roles or work assignments (see Performance Management section); * a form or process (e.g., passport) that accredits or documents employee progress; * final assessment to validate that the employee has acquired the necessary competencies to be considered for targeted roles / positions. Best practice organizations also have a talent management HR system that stores and reports information on employee competencies, and enables some or all parts of the Career Development and Succession Management process, for example: * employee / multi-source competency assessment; * catalogued learning resources; * on-line registration for courses / programs; * job / role matching that compares employee competencies against targeted role / job requirements; * various reporting capabilities that support both Succession Management (e.g., lists of employees ready for targeted positions / role) and broader HR Planning. Implementation Stages The following implementation stages are suggested for mid to large organizations implementing competencies in support of Career Development and Succession Management. =Stage 1= * Establish a Competency Architecture and Competency Dictionary that will support Career Development and Succession Management. * For each group to be profiled, define the typical roles and career streams for the job group. * Determine philosophy and policy with respect to how competencies will support Career Development and Succession Management and a high-level plan for implementation. =Stage 2= * Build and incorporate competency-based elements that will support Career Development and Succession Management (e.g., self-assessment; multi-source assessment; on-line information on Career Development for job groups; etc.). * Develop and implement Career Development / Succession Management programs for high need job groups. * Determine the human resources information management infrastructure required to support effective and efficient Career Development, Succession Management and HR Planning. Evaluate and implement on-line systems and tools consistent with requirements.

The New York Times called him \\"a founder of modern virology\\". Early life and education Melnick was born on October 9, 1914, in Boston and moved with his family to New Haven, Connecticut, when he was seven years old. He earned his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University in 1936 and was awarded a Ph.D. in physiological chemistry from Yale University. He became a member of the Yale faculty under John R. Paul, and was named a professor of epidemiology in 1954. Polio research Research by Melnick found that the most common way polio was spread was by fecal contamination, usually by soiled hands, and that the poliovirus could survive for extended periods in sewage. Other viruses, such as hepatitis, were also found in sewage, leading to improved purification standards. Higher levels of the polio virus were found in sewage during the summer, the same time of year the outbreaks of the disease were at their most severe, which John R. Paul observed \\"spoke loudly in favor of the idea that polio viruses circulate widely in the population and environment only during epidemic seasons\\". Together with Dorothy Horstmann, Melnick published the results of a study that showed that polio could be transmitted by flies, though they were not the primary vector for the disease. He was among the first to discover that the polio virus belonged to a larger class now known as the enteroviruses — a form of virus that could enter the central nervous system under certain conditions — and was among those who discovered that polio and other enteroviruses only rarely invade the central nervous system.Altman, Lawrence K. \\"Joseph Melnick, Polio Pioneer, Dies at 86\\", The New York Times, January 21, 2001.

Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor. Melnick was chosen as the chief virologist at the division of biological standards at the National Institutes of Health in 1957. He was hired by the Baylor College of Medicine in 1958 as the first head of the school's department of virology and epidemiology. Research he published in 1960 showed that the form of the attenuated vaccine used in the oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin was less harmful to the nervous system than comparable vaccines. A study he performed found that polio vaccine could be stored for long periods by using magnesium chloride as a preservative, eliminating the need for refrigeration. Melnick was named as dean of graduate sciences at Baylor in 1968, a position he held until 1991. Together with heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey, Melnick investigated the possible effects that cytomegalovirus might have on coronary artery diseases. Research performed by Melnick with a team at Baylor and published in the journal Science in 1968 and later found evidence that implicated viruses, including herpes simplex virus, as a cause of some forms of cervical cancer.Rawls, William E.; Adam, Ervin; and Melnick, Joseph L.

Human resource planning should serve as a link between human resource management and the overall strategic plan of an organization. Ageing workers population in most western countries and growing demands for qualified workers in developing economies have underscored the importance of effective human resource planning. As defined by Bulla and Scott, human resource planning is 'the process for ensuring that the human resource requirements of an organization are identified and plans are made for satisfying those requirements'.Bulla, D N and Scott, P M (1994) Manpower requirements forecasting: a case example, in Human Resource Forecasting and Modelling, ed D Ward, T P Bechet and R Tripp, Human Resource Planning Society, New York Reilly defined (workforce planning) as: 'A process in which an organization attempts to estimate the demand for labour and evaluate the size, nature and sources of supply which will be required to meet the demand. 'Reilly, P., (2003). Guide to Workforce Planning in Local Authorities, Employers Organization for Local Government, London. Human resource planning includes creating an employer brand, retention strategy, absence management strategy, flexibility strategy, (talent management) strategy, (recruitment) and selection strategy. Best practices 400px The planning processes of most best practice organizations not only define what will be accomplished within a given time-frame, but also the numbers and types of human resources that will be needed to achieve the defined business goals (e.g., number of human resources; the required competencies; when the resources will be needed; etc.). Competency-based management supports the integration of human resources planning with business planning by allowing organizations to assess the current human resource capacity based on their competencies against the capacity needed to achieve the vision, mission and business goals of the organization. Targeted human resource strategies, plans and programs to address gaps (e.g., hiring / staffing; learning; career development; succession management; etc.) are then designed, developed and implemented to close the gaps. These strategies and programs are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that they are moving the organizations in the desired direction, including closing employee competency gaps, and corrections are made as needed. This Strategic HR Planning and evaluation cycle is depicted in the diagram to the right. Human resource planning is the ongoing process of systematic planning to achieve the best use of an organisation's most valuable asset – its human resources. The objective of human resource (HR) planning is to ensure the best fit between employees and jobs, while avoiding workforce shortages or spares. The three key elements of the HR planning process are forecasting labour demand, analysing present labour supply, and balancing projected labour demand and supply. Implementation Stages = 1. Assessing the current HR capacity = * Develop a skills catalog for your employees so that you have a clear understanding of what your staff currently holds. This employee catalog should include everything from volunteer activities to certifications, of all degrees not just topics pertaining to their particular position. These catalogs can be assessed to deem whether or not an employee is ready to add more responsibility, or to forecast the employee's future development plans... = 2. Forecasting HR requirements = * This step includes projecting what the HR needs for the future will be based on the strategic goals of the organization. Keep in mind you will need to also accommodate for external challenges that can affect your organization. * Some questions to ask during this stage include: ** Which jobs will need to be filled in the upcoming period? ** What skill sets will people need? ** How many staff will be required to meet the strategic goals of our organization? ** Is the economy affecting our work and ability to appeal to new employees? ** How is our community evolving or expected to change in the upcoming period? = 3. Gap Analysis = * During this step you will observe where your organization is currently, and where you want to be in the future. You will identify things such as, the employee count, and the skills evaluation and compare it to what will be needed to achieve your future goal. During this phase you should also review your current HR practices and identify what you are doing that is useful and what you can add, that will help you achieve your goal. * Questions to answer in this stage include: ** What new jobs will we need? ** What new skills will we need? ** Do our present employees have the necessary skills? ** Are employees currently aligned to their strengths? ** Are current HR practices adequate to meet our future goal? = 4. Developing HR strategies to support the strategies of the organization. = * There are 5 HR strategies that you can follow to meet your organizational goals. ** Restructuring strategies *** This includes reducing staff, regrouping tasks to create well-designed jobs, and reorganizing work groups to perform more efficiently. ** Training and development strategies *** This includes providing the current staff with training and development opportunities to encompass new roles in the organization ** Recruitment strategies *** This includes recruiting new hires that already have the skills the organization will need in the future. ** Outsourcing strategies *** This includes outreaching to external individuals or organizations to complete certain tasks. ** Collaboration strategies *** This includes collaborating with other organizations to learn from how others do things, allow employees to gain skills and knowledge not previously available in their own organization. Tools and technologies Human resources use various tools and technologies to achieve its goals, especially when it comes to strategic planning. These technologies include but are not limited to social media, policies and management information systems. = Technologies= Social media Social media is used as a tool in human resources and business in general. This discipline deals with selecting appropriate social media sites and formats from the myriad options available and leveraging the same to create value for the organization. This requires an in-depth understanding of the key benefits and pitfalls of social media and managing these effectively in the organization's context. This discipline emphasizes harnessing social media for effective human resource management, which includes recruitment, collaboration and engagement. It also explores the non-financial impact as well as the approaches for measuring the return on investment in social media. Common social media outlets used in the HR field are LinkedIn, Facebook and Google Plus.  Management information systems (MIS) MIS are computerized information-processing systems designed to support the activities of company or organizational management. They go by various names all with varying functions, in the HR field these tools are commonly referred to as human resource management systems (HRIS). These programs assist professionals in records management, benefit administration and inquiries, hiring and team placement, coaching and training, attendance and payroll management. =Tools=  Policy Policies are set in place to assist in SHRP. These policies are targeted not only for selecting and training employees but also how they should conduct themselves in and outside the workplace and various other aspects of being employed at a workplace. For example, within several companies, there exists a social media policy which outlines how an employee should conduct themselves on personal accounts as a representative of their workplace.  Common policies in HR * Equal Employment Opportunity policies * Employee classifications * Workdays, paydays, and pay advances * Overtime compensation * Meal periods and break periods * Payroll deductions * Vacation policies * Holidays * Sick days and personal leave (for bereavement, jury duty, voting, etc.) * Performance evaluations and salary increases * Performance improvement * Termination policies Behavioral science Behavioral science is the scientific study of human behavior. This applied science is used as a tool in SHRP to help understand and manage human resources. This tool is particularly useful in organizational development and understanding/establishing organizational culture.  Theories =Strategic human resource management= Strategic human resource management is \\"critical importance of human resources to strategy, organizational capability to adapt to change and the goals of the organization\\". In other words, this is a strategy that intends to adapt the goals of an organization and is built off of other theories such as the contingency theory as well as institutional theory which fit under the umbrella of organizational theory. These theories look at the universalize, contingency and configuration perspectives to see the effect of human resource practices in organizations. The universalize perspective says that there are better human resource practices than others and those should be adopted within organization while contingency says that human resource practices need to align with other organization practices or the organizations mission, and configuration perspective is based on how to combine multiple aspects of human resource practices with effectiveness or performance. This can also be viewed as how human resource practices fit vertically or horizontally in an organization. This theory also involves looking at the value of human capital as well as social capital both in and outside of organizations and how this affects human resource practices. Human capital being knowledge and skills of individuals working for the organization and social capital is based on the character and value of relationships in and out of the organization. \\"Colbert suggests that SHRM should focus on the interactions and processes of the organization's social system—the intentions, choices and actions of people in the system and on HR systems as a coherent whole.\\" =Resource dependency theory= Resource dependence theory which is the theory that organizations are not self-sustaining there they must depend on outside resources to stay functioning. \\"Resources and dependence could help to explain how HR practices evolve from the interaction between nonprofits and their environment, how they deploy employee skills, behaviors and how HR systems are managed.\\" References Further reading            * Human resource management Planning ","title":"Strategic human resource planning"},{"id":"28969095","title":"Connecticut's 3rd assembly district"},{"id":"28969097","text":"The Battle of San Felasco Hammock was a battle of the Second Seminole War fought by Florida's Seminole Indians to prevent their removal to the Arkansas Territory in accordance with the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

The site upon which both Fort Gilleland and Newnansville once stood is now encompassed by the city of Alachua, Florida. The San Felasco Hammock is currently part of San Felasco Hammock Preserve State Park. Battle =Colonel Warren's report= At one o'clock this morning, four men of tried valor were sent out to reconnoiter around the San Felasco Hammock and the plantation of Colonel Sanchez; they returned at four o'clock, having made no discovery. Being satisfied that they were there, I resolved to go out; accordingly, at six o'clock I marched out with one hundred mounted men, being detachments from Captains Walker, Ward, and Garrison's companies, with twenty-five gentlemen under Captain Beekman, (having formerly belonged to his company, and volunteered their services for this special service,) Captain D. D. Tompkins, of company B, 1st regiment United States artillery, with a twenty-four-pound howitzer and twenty five of his men. This command was arranged in three lines, as follows: Captain Walker, with his company, and Lieutenant Bruten, in command of the detachment from Captain Garrison's company, formed the right wing under my personal command ; Captain Tompkins, with his command, formed the centre; and the volunteers under Captain Beekman, with Captain Ward's company, formed the left wing under Lieutenant Colonel Mills. On arriving within three-quarters of a mile of the hammock, the spies reported Indians in front; they immediately opened a sharp fire on the right wing and center. The Indians on the left, in considerable force, made an attempt to turn that flank, but were charged with spirit and success by Lieutenant Colonel Mills's command, and driven into a thick-wooded oak scrub; then, dismounting and charging on them, drove them through this into the border of the hammock, where the artillery played on them with considerable effect. After this, they retired to the right, and attempted to turn, that wing; but were charged with success by Captain Walker and Lieutenant Bruten's command, and again driven within range of the artillery, which opened on them with great effect. They made several desperate attempts to maintain their position, and charged twice on the artillery, but were driven off at all points, and pursued for a mile and a half into a dense hammock, where they could not be pursued to advantage. 1836 in the United States San Felasco Hammock San Felasco Hammock 1836 in Florida Territory September 1836 events ","title":"Battle of San Felasco Hammock"},{"id":"28969127","text":"Nature Communications is a peer-reviewed, open access, scientific journal published by Nature Research since 2010.

Released by Warner Bros. Animation on February 22, 2011. It is the tenth film in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies. Plot Dr. Leo Quintum and his team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped genetically-enhanced time- bomb clone made by Lex Luthor. Superman stops the clone but in doing so receives an overdose of solar radiation; it has given him increased powers, but at the cost of slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General Sam Lane, is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death. Superman asks Dr. Quintum to keep news of his impending death secret from the public. Wanting to spend as much of his remaining time as possible with Lois Lane, Superman reveals to her that he is Clark Kent, but she initially doubts his revelation because she had been unable to prove Superman's \\"Kent\\" identity herself. Superman takes her to the Fortress of Solitude. During this visit, Superman's secretive behavior and her indirect exposure to alien chemicals heightens Lois' paranoia. She is startled by Robot 7, shooting it and then Superman with a kryptonite laser. The solar radiation having made him immune to green kryptonite, Superman is able to calm her, explaining his caginess was to hide her birthday present, a serum granting her superpowers for 24 hours. Now as a Superwoman, she and Superman stop an attack by Subterranosauri led by Krull in Metropolis just as Samson (who tricked Krull into leading an attack on the surface world) and Atlas arrive. After the Subterranosauri are returned to the center of the Earth, their leader Tyrannko states to Superman that Krull will be dealt with. Samson flirts with Lois and gives her a necklace, the crown jewels of the Ultra-Sphinx. When Superman tells him to back off, he shows Superman a newspaper that reads \\"Superman Dead\\" and challenges Superman to contests to win Lois. The Ultra-Sphinx travels through time to reclaim the jewels Samson had stolen, placing Lois between life and death. Superman must answer an unanswerable question to save Lois. The unanswerable question is \\"What happens when the Irresistible Force meets the Immovable Object?\\" Superman beats Ultra- Sphinx's challenge with the answer being \\"they surrender\\". Superman then defeats Atlas and Samson in a double arm-wrestling match before spending the rest of the day with Lois as her powers fade. Later, Kent meets Luthor in his death row cell for an exclusive interview. However, the energy in Kent attracts Parasite, who goes berserk. Clark stops him while not revealing his secret identity, with Luthor disclosing his respect for Clark as both a journalist and a man. Luthor then reveals a tunnel from his cell for Clark to escape through, aided by Luthor's delinquent niece Nasthalthia. Luthor chooses not to escape as the satisfaction of outliving Superman is rewarding enough. Clark tells Lois he's dying, before leaving to take the city of Kandor to a new planet to thrive, despite it being permanently shrunk, as he does not believe he'll survive the trip back. Lois denies it, speaking of their future together with their super-children. Clark informs her that their biology is too incompatible for them to bear children. Clark leaves with Lois promising to wait for his return. Two months later, Superman returns to find Metropolis has been repaired with Kryptonian architecture and that Earth has been protected by Bar-El and Lilo, lost astronauts from Krypton. They followed the trail of the vessel that brought Superman to Earth. To his dismay, the two have less altruistic goals and intend to turn Earth into a new Krypton. As they fight Superman outside of the Daily Planet, Bar-El and Lilo begin showing signs of illness: the two had passed through the remnants of Krypton and thus were saturated with Kryptonite. To save them and at their request, Superman places the two in the Phantom Zone until a cure can be found. After settling his affairs, Superman proceeds to finish his last will and testament. Luthor reprogrammed one of the Fortress' robots to steal the serum Superman made for Lois' birthday. Having the powers of Superman, Luthor's death by electric chair failed and he escapes unfettered. He meets with Nasthalthia below one of his lairs to continue his plans. Superman finishes his will when he learns of Luthor's secret ally Solaris; the tyrant star computer has betrayed Luthor by tampering with Earth's sun and turned it blue. With his robots, Superman engages Solaris in space. However, Solaris' raw power output vaporized all of the robots, with Robot #7 sacrificing itself to damage Solaris to redeem itself for being manipulated into stealing the super serum. All seems lost until Superman's pet Sun-Eater sacrifices itself to weaken the tyrant star, which allows Superman to destroy Solaris. Clark returns to the Daily Planet, very ill, and collapses upon completing his article, \\"SUPERMAN DEAD\\". When the staff tries to save him they realize that he has stopped breathing and his heart has stopped. But before they can do anything to help Clark, the super- powered Lex Luthor arrives and attempts to kill Lois. Clark revives and fires a gravity gun at Luthor. Superman tells Luthor that he has been on to him ever since Superman Robot #7 first malfunctioned. As his powers fade, Luthor briefly sees the world as Superman sees it and weeps as he gains a measure of understanding of the subatomic and how it interconnects. The gravity weapon has warped time causing Luthor's powers to burn out at a faster rate. As his powers drain, Luthor wishes the experience to continue. He believes he can solve the grand unification theory but when he reaches for his next vial of serum, he realizes that Superman has stolen his supply. Superman then destroys the serum over Luthor's protests, pointing out that if Luthor truly cared about solving the world's problems, he would have done so long ago. Luthor somberly admits Superman is right. With Superman's body starting to turn into pure energy, he and Lois embrace one final time and, he proclaims his love for her once-and-for all. He gives her his cape as a way to remember him before he leaves and flies into the sun (seemingly) sacrificing himself to save the Earth. Later, when Lois sits on a bench in front of a statue of Superman, Jimmy invites her to attend a memorial service being held for Superman, Lois does not go as she believes that Superman is not dead and will return after he repairs the sun, Quintum visits Luthor in his cell, now enlightened from his ordeal and accepting his impending death, Luthor presents Quintum with the only thing that could redeem him for his actions over the years, a formula to recreate Superman's genetic structure through a healthy human ovum, as Quintum leaves, he sadly muses \\"They always said they wanted children\\". The movie ends with a picture of Superman fixing the sun and Lois' voice once more stating \\"he's not dead, he's up there fixing the sun and when he's done, he'll be back\\".

Paul Madeira, who is also known as Paul Madeira Mertz, was a jazz pianist and arranger who had first worked with Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey in 1922 in their first orchestra The Wild Canaries. Mertz had been a pianist in the Bix Beiderbecke band The Rhythm Jugglers in the 1920s and had worked in Hollywood on film music from the 1930s to the 1960s. He had played on the 1925 jazz classic \\"Davenport Blues\\" in 1925 released on Gennett Records. Mertz also played piano on the 1927 Grammy Hall of Fame inductee \\"Singin' the Blues\\" by Frankie Trumbauer and his Orchestra featuring Bix Beiderbecke, Eddie Lang, and Jimmy Dorsey.

A map collection or map library is a storage facility for maps, usually in a library, archive, or museum, or at a map publisher or public- benefit corporation, and the maps and other cartographic items stored within that facility. Sometimes, map collections are combined with graphic sheets, manuscripts and rare prints in a single department. In such cases, the expression \\"map collection\\" refers to the whole of the cartographic collection holdings. History Even in medieval libraries, maps formed part of the inventories. According to scholars of the renaissance, maps were collected from the 15th century, either at the court or at naval academies to prepare for voyages of discovery. Over time, new techniques, such as copper engraving, reduced production costs, and assisted in spreading maps more widely. By the 17th century, private map collections were often the basis for public map collections. As early as 1571, for example, the Court Library in Munich, Bavaria, (now the Bavarian State Library) became the owner of the Fugger collection. In 1823, the British Museum in London acquired the King's Library, which had been inherited and greatly enlarged by George III of the United Kingdom, and donated to the Museum by his heir, George IV of the United Kingdom. The King's Library included a collection of approximately 50,000 maps, plans and views, which are now housed at the British Library and known as the King's Topographical Collection. In the development of public map collections, the geographical societies were important. They exerted great influence on the establishment and collection policy of such collections, or even stored their own collections at such institutions. So, for example, in 1680 Vincenzo Coronelli founded the Accademia Cosmographicae degli Argonauti, which existed until 1718. In Nuremberg, the Kosmographische Gesellschaft was established in 1740, while a namesake organization came into existence in Vienna in 1790. The Société de Géographie de Paris, founded in 1821, was the first modern geographic society. Especially in the 19th century, many map collections were either newly established, or merged with existing collections of cartographic materials held by libraries under the responsibility of specialist librarians. Collection types and development *In academic libraries, map collections usually have a stock of old maps and atlases. Often such libraries also acquire new copies of various official topographic map series, individual thematic maps, national atlases and thematic regional atlases. Academic library map collections usually also have cartographic literature. *National libraries collect all the maps that fall within their territory and are submitted by the publishing houses of that territory in compliance with applicable legal deposit laws. *General and regional libraries, depending upon their orientation, collect tourist maps and city maps, sometimes linked with travel guides. *Map publishers and map producing agencies (for example, Survey Offices) archive their own map production. These collections are in some cases not open to the public. *Private collections are often set up thematically or regionally, so that private map collectors not uncommonly develop into renowned experts, and authors of map bibliographies, in their specific collection area. *A collection of globes can be considered as a special type of map collection. Documentation Newly published maps, like books, are recorded in national bibliographies. Thus, the title, author(s), imprint and ISBN of any recently published map are mentioned in official records. Additionally, various data specific to a map, such as scale, map projection, geographical coordinates and map format, are included in the records of that map. Most academic map collection owners now index at least the most important parts of the collection in electronic catalogues that can be viewed online. Older collections or private collections are often described in bibliophile catalogues. In such catalogues, at least representative parts of the collection are shown. Bibliophile catalogues provide evidence of the collection's stock that can be used in the event of theft. Also, the use of a collection's rarities can thereby be noticeably limited, as in many cases the image and scientific description of the map is sufficient for the required purpose, and thus the original map is left undisturbed. Holdings in archives are often not indexed on a single sheet by sheet basis, but on a basis under which a sheet can be found in the records only with the assistance of a finding aid. Archive staff, often not trained in cartographic matters, can be cautious in describing an unwieldy, and in some ways reputedly \\"foreign\\" document type. For that reason, significant characteristics such as the projection and map scale of an individual sheet will often be omitted from an index to a map collection. These circumstances make it difficult for users of such indexes to search for a specific map in an archive, but still allow persistent researchers to make some 'discoveries'. Major map collections =Overview= The authoritative guide World directory of map collections (2000)* lists 714 map collections in 121 countries. With few exceptions, the most valuable map collections are held in either Europe or North America. There are also some map collections in South America, Africa and South Asia, but those collections are comparatively rare and of much lower value. =Europe= Austria Indisputably the largest map collection in Austria is the Map Department of the Austrian National Library in Vienna. It has about 275,000 maps, 240,000 geographic-topographic views, 570 globes, 80 reliefs and models of fortresses, and about 75,000 volumes of technical literature and atlases, Also a department of the Austrian National Library is the world's only public Globe Museum, at the Palais Mollard, Vienna. Belgium The Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels has a collection of over 200,000 maps, atlases, cartographic books and globes. Most of these items relate either to Belgium, or to its former colony the Democratic Republic of Congo. France The Département des cartes et plans of the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris ranks among the top three worldwide collections of cartographic materials. It holds stocks of atlases, maps, map series, globes, geography games, city maps, building plans and relief maps. Germany The largest map collections in Germany are those of the Berlin State Library, the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Göttingen State and University Library. Not currently publicly available is the collection of the publisher Justus Perthes in Gotha, which is owned by the state of Thuringia and presently housed at the University of Erfurt. Spain The National Library of Spain in Madrid has a collection of over 500,000 maps. Switzerland In Switzerland, there are major map collections in several libraries. The map collection in ETH Zurich's library is the largest, and specialises in thematic maps. The map collection of the Zentralbibliothek Zürich covers to a large extent the various official topographic map series and national atlases. Located in Bern is the Ryhiner Collection, a former private collection of Johann Friedrich von Ryhiner with a focus on the 17th and 18th centuries. United Kingdom Major map collections are held at the British Library in London, the National Library of Scotland (available free online), the National Library of Wales and the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. =North America= Canada Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa has a collection of some two million cartographic items. United States The world's largest collection of maps is held by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It includes around 5.2 million maps. The Osher Map Library located on the University of Southern Maine's Portland Campus has a large collection of maps, atlases, and globes. =Oceania= Australia The map collection of the National Library of Australia in Canberra includes over 600,000 maps and 2,500 atlases. Challenges ahead As with books in libraries, map collections now put more weight on creation of digital documents. These include maps and atlases on CD-ROM and DVD and in some cases the provision of Geodata. Such new forms of publication present map collections with major problems, as not just \\"mere\\" text and some inline images need to be kept, but very large amounts of data, up to several Gigabytes, that may eventually be required to operate specialised geographic information systems. Also, the long-term storage of cartographic data is an unresolved issue that is particularly important for archives. The digitization of analogue map stocks also offers the opportunity to link library catalogues directly with the images (or at least with so-called thumbnails). Also, digitally processed sheet indexes to individual sheets of map series allow for more targeted research from one's own workplace.

Based on mathematics and sociology, the Promethee and Gaia method was developed at the beginning of the 1980s and has been extensively studied and refined since then. It has particular application in decision making, and is used around the world in a wide variety of decision scenarios, in fields such as business, governmental institutions, transportation, healthcare and education. Rather than pointing out a \\"right\\" decision, the Promethee and Gaia method helps decision makers find the alternative that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, identifying and quantifying its conflicts and synergies, clusters of actions, and highlight the main alternatives and the structured reasoning behind.  History The basic elements of the Promethee method have been first introduced by Professor Jean-Pierre Brans (CSOO, VUB Vrije Universiteit Brussel) in 1982. It was later developed and implemented by Professor Jean- Pierre Brans and Professor Bertrand Mareschal (Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, ULB Université Libre de Bruxelles), including extensions such as GAIA. The descriptive approach, named Gaia, allows the decision maker to visualize the main features of a decision problem: he/she is able to easily identify conflicts or synergies between criteria, to identify clusters of actions and to highlight remarkable performances. The prescriptive approach, named Promethee, provides the decision maker with both complete and partial rankings of the actions. Promethee has successfully been used in many decision making contexts worldwide. A non-exhaustive list of scientific publications about extensions, applications and discussions related to the Promethee methods was published in 2010.  Uses and applications  While it can be used by individuals working on straightforward decisions, the Promethee & Gaia is most useful where groups of people are working on complex problems, especially those with several criteria, involving a lot of human perceptions and judgments, whose decisions have long-term impact. It has unique advantages when important elements of the decision are difficult to quantify or compare, or where collaboration among departments or team members are constrained by their different specializations or perspectives. Decision situations to which the Promethee and Gaia can be applied include: * Choice – The selection of one alternative from a given set of alternatives, usually where there are multiple decision criteria involved. * Prioritization – Determining the relative merit of members of a set of alternatives, as opposed to selecting a single one or merely ranking them. * Resource allocation – Allocating resources among a set of alternatives * Ranking – Putting a set of alternatives in order from most to least preferred * Conflict resolution – Settling disputes between parties with apparently incompatible objectives The applications of Promethee and Gaia to complex multi-criteria decision scenarios have numbered in the thousands, and have produced extensive results in problems involving planning, resource allocation, priority setting, and selection among alternatives. Other areas have included forecasting, talent selection, and tender analysis. Some uses of Promethee and Gaia have become case-studies. Recently these have included: * Deciding which resources are the best with the available budget to meet SPS quality standards (STDF – WTO) [See more in External Links] * Selecting new route for train performance (Italferr)[See more in External Links]  The mathematical model  = Assumptions = Let A=\\\\\\\\{a_1 ,..,a_n\\\\\\\\} be a set of n actions and let F=\\\\\\\\{f_1 ,..,f_q\\\\\\\\} be a consistent family of q criteria. Without loss of generality, we will assume that these criteria have to be maximized. The basic data related to such a problem can be written in a table containing n\\\\times q evaluations. Each line corresponds to an action and each column corresponds to a criterion. : \\\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\\\hline & f_{1}(\\\\cdot) & f_{2}(\\\\cdot) & \\\\cdots & f_{j}(\\\\cdot) & \\\\cdots & f_{q}(\\\\cdot) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline a_{1} & f_{1}(a_{1}) & f_{2}(a_{1}) & \\\\cdots & f_{j}(a_{1}) & \\\\cdots & f_{q}(a_{1}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline a_{2} & f_{1}(a_{2}) & f_{2}(a_{2}) & \\\\cdots & f_{j}(a_{2}) & \\\\cdots & f_{q}(a_{2}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots &\\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & .\\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline a_{i} & f_{1}(a_{i}) & f_{2}(a_{i}) & \\\\cdots & f_{j}(a_{i}) & \\\\cdots & f_{q}(a_{i}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots& \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline a_{n} & f_{1}(a_{n}) & f_{2}(a_{n}) & \\\\cdots & f_{j}(a_{n}) & \\\\cdots& f_{q}(a_{n}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\end{array} = Pairwise comparisons = At first, pairwise comparisons will be made between all the actions for each criterion: :d_k(a_i,a_j)=f_k(a_i)-f_k(a_j) d_k(a_i,a_j) is the difference between the evaluations of two actions for criterion f_k. Of course, these differences depend on the measurement scales used and are not always easy to compare for the decision maker. = Preference degree = As a consequence the notion of preference function is introduced to translate the difference into a unicriterion preference degree as follows: :\\\\pi_k(a_i,a_j)=P_k[d_k(a_i,a_j)] where P_k:\\\\R\\\\rightarrow[0,1] is a positive non-decreasing preference function such that P_j(0)=0. Six different types of preference function are proposed in the original Promethee definition. Among them, the linear unicriterion preference function is often used in practice for quantitative criteria: :P_k(x) \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\text{if } x\\\\le q_k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{x-q_k}{p_k-q_k}, & \\\\text{if } q_kp_k \\\\end{cases} where q_j and p_j are respectively the indifference and preference thresholds. The meaning of these parameters is the following: when the difference is smaller than the indifference threshold it is considered as negligible by the decision maker. Therefore, the corresponding unicriterion preference degree is equal to zero. If the difference exceeds the preference threshold it is considered to be significant. Therefore, the unicriterion preference degree is equal to one (the maximum value). When the difference is between the two thresholds, an intermediate value is computed for the preference degree using a linear interpolation. = Multicriteria preference degree = When a preference function has been associated to each criterion by the decision maker, all comparisons between all pairs of actions can be done for all the criteria. A multicriteria preference degree is then computed to globally compare every couple of actions: :\\\\pi(a,b)=\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^qP_{k}(a,b)\\\\cdot w_{k} Where w_k represents the weight of criterion f_k. It is assumed that w_k\\\\ge 0 and \\\\sum_{k=1}^q w_{k}=1. As a direct consequence, we have: :\\\\pi(a_i,a_j)\\\\ge 0 :\\\\pi(a_i,a_j)+\\\\pi(a_j,a_i)\\\\le 1 = Multicriteria preference flows = In order to position every action with respect to all the other actions, two scores are computed: :\\\\phi^{+}(a)=\\\\frac{1}{n-1}\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{x \\\\in A}\\\\pi(a,x) :\\\\phi^{-}(a)=\\\\frac{1}{n-1}\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{x \\\\in A}\\\\pi(x,a) The positive preference flow \\\\phi^{+}(a_i) quantifies how a given action a_i is globally preferred to all the other actions while the negative preference flow \\\\phi^{-}(a_i) quantifies how a given action a_i is being globally preferred by all the other actions. An ideal action would have a positive preference flow equal to 1 and a negative preference flow equal to 0. The two preference flows induce two generally different complete rankings on the set of actions. The first one is obtained by ranking the actions according to the decreasing values of their positive flow scores. The second one is obtained by ranking the actions according to the increasing values of their negative flow scores. The Promethee I partial ranking is defined as the intersection of these two rankings. As a consequence, an action a_i will be as good as another action a_j if \\\\phi^{-}(a_i) \\\\ge \\\\phi^{-}(a_j) and \\\\phi^{-}(a_i)\\\\le \\\\phi^{-}(a_j) The positive and negative preference flows are aggregated into the net preference flow: :\\\\phi(a)=\\\\phi^{+}(a)-\\\\phi^{-}(a) Direct consequences of the previous formula are: :\\\\phi(a_i) \\\\in [-1;1] :\\\\sum_{a_i \\\\in A} \\\\phi(a_i)=0 The Promethee II complete ranking is obtained by ordering the actions according to the decreasing values of the net flow scores. = Unicriterion net flows = According to the definition of the multicriteria preference degree, the multicriteria net flow can be disaggregated as follows: :\\\\phi(a_i)=\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^q\\\\phi_{k}(a_i).w_{k} Where: :\\\\phi_{k}(a_i)=\\\\frac{1}{n-1}\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{a_j \\\\in A}\\\\\\\\{P_{k}(a_i,a_j)-P_{k}(a_j,a_i)\\\\\\\\}. The unicriterion net flow, denoted \\\\phi_{k}(a_i)\\\\in[-1;1], has the same interpretation as the multicriteria net flow \\\\phi(a_i) but is limited to one single criterion. Any action a_i can be characterized by a vector \\\\vec \\\\phi(a_i) =[\\\\phi_1(a_i),\\\\ldots,\\\\phi_k(a_i),\\\\phi_q(a_i)] in a q dimensional space. The GAIA plane is the principal plane obtained by applying a principal components analysis to the set of actions in this space. = Promethee preference functions = *Usual ::P_j(d_j)= \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } d_j\\\\leq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] 1 & \\\\text{if } d_j>0 \\\\end{cases} *U-shape ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} P_{j}(d_{j})=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{lll} 0 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}\\\\leq q_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}> q_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\end{array} *V-shape ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} P_{j}(d_{j})=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{lll} \\\\frac{|d_{j}|}{p_{j}} & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}\\\\leq p_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}> p_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\end{array} *Level ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} P_{j}(d_{j})=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{lll} 0 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}\\\\leq q_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\text{if} & q_{j}<|d_{j}\\\\leq p_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}> p_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\end{array} *Linear ::\\\\begin{array}{cc} P_{j}(d_{j})=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{lll} 0 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}\\\\leq q_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{|d_{j}|-q_{j}}{p_{j}-q_{j}} & \\\\text{if} & q_{j}<|d_{j}\\\\leq p_{j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\text{if} & |d_{j}> p_{j}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right. \\\\end{array} *Gaussian ::P_{j}(d_{j})=1-e^{-\\\\frac{d_{j}^{2}}{2s_{j}^{2}}}  Promethee rankings  =Promethee I= Promethee I is a partial ranking of the actions.

To Edward and Betty castillo and has two brothers Billy and Randy. After high school, he enrolled in the University of California, Riverside with a major in American frontier history and a minor in Latin American studies. After graduating in 1969, Castillo took a minority counseling position at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In that same year he was hired as a graduate student instructor in UCLA’s newly established Native American Studies program. Ed is the recognized father of Suelumatra with his wife Luwana Quitiquit, and Cassandra and Andrew Castillo (second marriage), although he may have other children. Participation at Alcatraz Castillo first got involved with the American Indian occupation of Alcatraz when Richard Oakes, the foremost organizer of the demonstration, gave a speech at UCLA attempting to get more support for the protest in mid- November 1969. Oakes had been giving similarly effective speeches at San Francisco State University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Riverside. Castillo, along with about two-thirds of the Native American studies class he was teaching, agreed to take leave from his position at UCLA and join the occupation. He was 21 years old at the time. When he arrived at Alcatraz, Castillo was one of the original members on the island council, along with Richard Oakes and a number of other college students.Johnson, Troy R. The American Indian Occupation of Alcatraz Island: Red Power and Self-determination. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2008. Print. The island council oversaw everything that occurred on the island. Castillo also worked in the makeshift mail room of the island. Early on during the occupation, Castillo was voted as security chief of the island, but soon resigned from the difficult position after numerous threats from much larger young Indian males. When Richard Oakes left the island due to the death of his daughter, Castillo began to notice the burgeoning of inner conflicts within the island’s population. He believed the original idealism of the island was faltering, and many of the island’s leaders were focused more on the political and financial benefits of the protest. After nearly three months of participating in the occupation, Castillo decided to return to UCLA to fulfill his teaching duties.Johnson, Troy R., Joane Nagel, and Duane Champagne. American Indian Activism: Alcatraz to the Longest Walk. Urbana: University of Illinois, 1997. Print. Later life Castillo is currently the director of the Native American studies program at Sonoma State University. He has worked on numerous books, usually dealing with the history of California Native American tribes. The majority of his scholarly works focus on the impact of Spanish colonization on Native Americans in the 17th and 18th centuries. He shocked the mission studies world by publishing an oral history by Lorenzo Asisara given in 1878 which explained how the Indians at Santa Cruz murdered the missionary Andres Quintana in retaliation for whippings the friar had given with a barb-tipped whip, and then set the girls free for a night of sex.Edward Castillo (1989), “The Assassination of Padre Andrés Quintana by the Indians of Mission Santa Cruz in 1812: The Narrative of Lorenzo Asisara” in California History 68.

Legacy  = Works = Since 1850 Jubani documented the folklore of his home region. In 1858 part of his work was published in the Histoire et description de la Haute Albanie ou Guegarie written by Hyacinthe Hecguard, then French consul of Shkodër. The original texts of the folk songs documented by Jubani included in Hecguard's work were lost on 13 January 1866 during a flood in Shkodër. His best known work is the Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies (, ) published in 1871 in Trieste. The Collection of Albanian Folk Songs and Rhapsodies is the first collection of folk songs in the Gheg Albanian dialect and the first folklore work published by an Albanian who lived in Albania. The book was published along with two political and philosophical studies of Jubani the Current situation of the population of northern Albania () and Thoughts on the moral situation and intellectual culture of the Albanian people (), which were introductory to his main work. In the two introductory studies Jubani advocated for the formation of a literary commission for the purification of the Albanian language and the promotion of Albanian literature.Clayer, p. 229 Jubani also supported the creation of a unique alphabet for the Albanian language, arguing that since Albanian was a unique language, it should have a separate alphabet, and wrote a grammar textbook of the Albanian language. In Trieste he became one of the editors of a local newspaper and in 1873 he edited and translated from Ottoman Turkish to Italian Law, appendix and procedure of the Ottoman commerce (), a book about commerce practices in the Ottoman Empire.Clayer, p. 217 In 1878 he published in Venice a pamphlet to encourage the use of steamships in routes between Albania and Italy. Jubani's study On the Albanian poetry and music was among the first works that dealt with the polyphonic music of the area of Myzeqe. = Political philosophy = Jubani's political philosophy was influenced largely by classical liberalism and anti-clericalism during his travels in Malta and Italy. He believed that reforms should be based on an industrial economic policy, the center of which would be an Albanian bourgeoisie, whose commerce with Europe would be encouraged and it would pay lower taxes, while that social class would heavily support the industrial development of Albania. He often accused the Catholic and Muslim clergy of inciting and encouraging religious segregation and differences. Jubani criticized the Italian missionaries for teaching only in Italian, while in previous years Albanian had been used too.Clayer, p. 218 The Jesuit missionaries of Shkodër eventually denounced Jubani to the Holy See as an anti-clerical propagandist.

After his failures against Huang, he returned to Taining, but in 886 was displaced in a surprise attack by Zhu Jin.  Resistance against Huang Chao  Little is known about Qi Kerang's background, as he did not have a biography in either of the official histories of Tang Dynasty, the Old Book of TangOld Book of Tang, Table of Contents. and the New Book of Tang.New Book of Tang, Table of Contents. As of 880, he was serving as the military governor of Taining Circuit, when then-reigning Emperor Xizong ordered the troops of several eastern circuits to be stationed at Yin River (溵水, a major branch of the Shaying River), and Qi Kerang's Taining troops to be stationed at Ru Prefecture (汝州, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan), to block off the northwestward advance by the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. In fall 880, Huang arrived in the region and, due to sheer numerical advantages (150,000 to 6,000), defeated Qi Kerang's colleague Cao Quanzhen () the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Further, around the same time, Xue Neng () the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) was killed in a mutiny led by Zhou Ji. Qi, worried that Zhou would ambush him, abandoned his defensive position and returned to Taining's capital Yan Prefecture (); following his lead, the other circuits' forces also abandoned their defensive position at Yin River, allowing Huang an open path toward the eastern capital Luoyang and the imperial capital Chang'an. Qi soon regrouped and returned to the vicinity of Luoyang, but faced with Huang's growing strength, decided to withdraw to Tong Pass to defend it against Huang's further advance toward Chang'an. At that time, he still had more than 10,000 soldiers, but his troops had no food supplies. When Emperor Xizong commissioned the imperial guard general Zhang Chengfan () to reinforce Qi with a few thousand troops, Zhang objected on the basis that neither his troops nor Qi's troops had food supplies; Emperor Xizong sent Zhang on his way anyway, claiming that the food supplies would follow, but none did.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. On January 4, 881,Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter. Zhang's relief troops arrived at Tong Pass, as did Huang's forward troops. Qi's troops and Huang's troops battled for most of the morning, and initially were able to fight off Huang's troops. However, around noontime, Qi's troops, in hunger, collapsed, and the soldiers trampled through Jinkeng (), a valley full of thorns that served as part of the defensive perimeter for Tong Pass, destroying the thorns and therefore leaving Tong Pass open to attack. Qi fled, while Zhang continued to try to defend Tong Pass, but it fell, allowing Huang to continue on and capture Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu.  Removal from Taining  After his failure against Huang Chao, Qi Kerang appeared to have returned to Taining, for he was still referred to as the military governor of Taining in 885 (by which time Huang Chao had been defeated and Emperor Xizong had returned to Chang'an) when, as the result of a major dispute between the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi and Wang Chongrong the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Tian tried to transfer Wang to Taining, Qi to Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), and Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu to Hezhong. Wang Chucun defended Wang Chongrong in a petition, while Wang Chongrong gathered his troops and, along with his ally Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), defeated those of Tian and Tian's allies Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). What position Qi took during the affair was unclear, but there was no record that he either refused to or tried to report to Yiwu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. In 886, Zhu Jin, an officer at Tianping and the cousin to Tianping's then-military governor Zhu Xuan, asked Qi to give his daughter in marriage to Zhu Jin. Qi agreed, but did not know that this was actually part of Zhu Jin's plot to take over Taining. Zhu Jin led a procession from Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture () to Yan Prefecture, and on his wagons hid weapons and armor. When he reached Yan Prefecture, on the day that he was supposed to receive the bride, he made a surprise attack, evicting Qi from Yan Prefecture. He took over Taining Circuit and was eventually commissioned to be Taining's new military governor. That was the last historical reference to Qi, and it is not known what happened to him afterwards.

He wanted it to be called the Astley Ainslie Institution. The hospital opened with 34 beds in 1923. The landscaping of the grounds was executed by Roland Edgar Cooper, just prior to his becoming Head Curator of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Pavilions were added to the east and west in 1929 and a nurses' home was completed in 1930. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948.

He is the founder and CEO of The Last Two Music Group and is also known for grooming some of the best Ghanaian Hip Hop or Hiplife artists, including Obrafour, Tinny, Kwaw Kese, Sarkodie, Ayigbe Edem, and others. As a producer, he is credited as one of the pioneers and key figures in the popularization of Hiplife or Hip Hop made in Ghana. Summary =The Last Two= Hammer began his career in music accidentally, when a friend of his (Yaw Opare Anoff, aka Way Deep), a gifted keyboardist at the time encouraged him to take up the career because he realized Hammer had the ability to dissect and analyze music in the most unusual ways as a professional does.\\"Hammer of Last 2 Endorses PPP\\\\'s Papa Kwesi Induom\\", Tonga.gh, May 11, 2015. He also had the habit of finding faults with world-class professional music which he thought could be better. This friend and Hammer then formed a production unit called The Last Two, meaning the only two left to put Ghana on the world map musically. Together they produced an album for a young artist called Obrafour which became the highest selling Hiplife album in Ghana. This album was called Pae mu ka. Way Deep, however, left for the United States while Hammer remained as \\"one of the two\\" left alone with the task of fulfilling the dream of two. Hammer however decided to maintain the name The Last Two as a tribute to his friendship with Way Deep. =Liberating the Tribes in Hip Hop= After Obrafour's album, Hammer took up a new dream to spread Hiplife or Hip Hop in Ghana through all dialects instead of the stereotypical Akan language, which was and is the most popular language in the country. After Obrafour (who rapped in the Twi dialect, typical of the Ashanti people), he challenged himself by risking the production of albums in other unpopular dialects, musically and made history again with the recording of Tinny, who raps in the Ga language, typical of the people of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. He went down in history as the bestselling Ga act to date. He then challenged himself again with Kwaw Kese ending up as the biggest Fante act to date. The Fante language is typical of the indigenes of the Central Region and parts of the Western Region of Ghana. The story followed with Ayigbe Edem adding to Hammer’s credit as the biggest Ewe rapper to date. The Ewe language is the mother tongue of the Volta Region of Ghana and neighbouring Togo and Benin. =Compilation albums= Hammer also releases occasional compilation albums which give the numerous artists who flock to his camp, a chance to be on wax without releasing an album. The compilation albums include Execution Diary (2003), which was in partnership with Obrafour, Sounds of Our Time (2004), The Crusade of the Lost Files (2006) and the ongoing Evolution Recruits. A known perfectionist and a very passionate musician, Hammer’s methods of grooming his artists have come into question and controversy but the results of the unearthing of iconic stars seems to shut negative observers up. Hammer also does occasional scoring of movies, including the American movie Bloody Street. Early life =Growing up= The third child of Jones A. Osei and Marian Osei, Hammer was born Edward Nana Poku Osei on 27 March 1976. His father was a banker and his mother was in the fishing industry. They both had six children consisting of three boys and three girls, in order, Albert Osei, Angela Osei, Edward Osei, Elizane Osei, Karen Osei and Jones Osei jnr. He is also a descendant of the late Otumfour Opoku Ware II, one time King of the Asanti Region. The family lived in North Kaneshie and later moved to East Legon, a wealthy neighborhood in the capital in the late eighties. Hammer attended Yellow Duckling nursery school, St Theresa’s School, Achimota Primary School and finally the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School, Legon. However his passion for music became a distraction from active academics and so he could not further his education to the university level. Occasionally in his adolescent, the family lived in the United Kingdom and he also lived in the United States during his late teens. Although his father was heartbroken as Hammer’s grades fell, the family realized he was a born musician and eventually supported him. Hammer was known to drum on any surface available to him anywhere he found himself and was also known to patrol his neighborhood with a boom box sound system while playing loud music with friends. =Inspiration= Growing up on his father’s musical collection (such as Bonny M, the Bee Gees, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Pavarotti, Bonnie Tyler and several television and movie theme instrumentals such as James Bond, Dynasty, Neighbours, Dallas, etc.), Hammer digested works from these great icons as early as age seven and this gave him an unusual perspective over his peers, equipping him with skills that would eventually shape up his musical career. After the hip-hop revolution, Hammer then became a fan of Special Ed, A Tribe called Quest, EPMD, De La Soul, Craig Mack, Guru, Rakim, Das Efx, Jay-Z, Dr. Dre, etc. But his real inspiration came from Osibisa, Quincy Jones and Bob Marley. Hammer is known to be a very reserved person and avoids nightclubs, parties and other social gatherings. The name \\"Hammer\\" initially came from a mock performance of MC Hammer’s \\"Here comes the Hammer\\" back in school as a fresher but now the Hammer name is related to the raging heavy drums associated with his music production. Hammer lives a simple life far from the celebrated person he is. Fans have credited him for being very down-to-earth. Career =Obrafour= In 1997, as the young Hammer and Way Deep started their music production career, a friend (Edward Adu Mensah) introduced them to Obrafour, a potential rapper with unusual singing abilities and after vigorous grooming from Hammer, his debut album produced by Hammer and Way Deep was released on the Home Base Record label owned by Daniel \\"Masoul\\" Adjei and was later managed by Noise Management, owned by Abraham Ohene Djan in August 1999. After Obrafour’s album, a disagreement between Way Deep and Hammer split the two producers but they have since remained friends outside their production differences and still keep in constant touch. Way Deep however has since evolved into a singer and plays several more live instruments such as saxophone, guitar, etc. Obrafour has remained a multi award winner to date at the Ghana Music Awards and other parts of Africa. =Tinny= Tinny was also a full beneficiary of Hammer’s grooming and entire production which earned him a classic for a debut album. In order to reduce the risk of the release of Tinny who was emerging with the Ga language, very unpopular then in the music industry, Hammer decided to feature him on Obrafour’s third album hit single \\"Oye ohene\\" remix, which shot Tinny up to stardom even before his debut was released. There was also a dispute between Hammer and Tinny during the recording of his maiden album called Makola Kwakwe. Apparently, Tinny was caught up in the Twi revolution and despite being a Ga, he wanted to force himself to rap in Twi because of a wider market. Hammer however believed Tinny would popularize the Ga language in the industry and would not allow him to rap in Twi as he believed Tinny would be ousted by the Twi-speaking rappers. The issue was settled finally as Tinny’s family agreed that the Ga language should dominate the album with snippets of Twi and the result was a pride for the Ga people and a number one spot for Tinny. He went on to win several awards at the Ghana Music Awards in subsequent years and other awards in parts of Africa. =Kwaw Kese= In 2004, Hammer took up yet another challenge with an artist called Kwaw Kese, an indigene of the ‘fante’ language who hailed from Agona Swedru in the Central Region. Kwaw Kese came to the capital purposely to look for Hammer through one of Hammer’s artistes “Dogo”and upon his first audition, Hammer confirmed his potential and started grooming him. Within three months of training, Hammer released a single, ‘oye nonsense’ from him which immediately made him eligible for concerts and appearances. Demand for this artist was so high that Hammer had to release the second single ‘kwakwa” which certified Kwaw Kese as the best ‘fante’ rapper Ghana had ever seen. His debut album however was delayed until the following year and in the 2007/2008 Ghana Music Awards, Kwaw Kese went on to win about seven awards. =Edem= In 2005, Hammer got married and had his first child. He eventually took a break from production for more than two years until the middle of 2007 when he took up the project of yet another artist from another part of the country. This artist, Ayigbe Edem, was introduced to Hammer two years earlier by Jay Foley, an advertising agency owner who used to be a production student of Hammer back in 2002. Edem’s potential was obvious from the word go and Hammer started grooming him immediately. The result was the landmark album titled ‘The Volta Regime’ which immediately put the Volta Region on the Ghanaian hip hop musical map. The album earned Ayigbe Edem seven nominations with one win at the 2010 Ghana Music Awards. Edem is still recording his second album and lives away from the noise of the city in the outskirts of the capital Accra. =Sarkodie= During the recording of The Volta Regime album in 2009, a young potential rapper named Sarkodie approached Hammer for a recording deal. After auditioning, Hammer branded Sarkodie as a rap encyclopedia due to the various styles he could conjure on impulse. He then tagged Sarkodie as a special case and encouraged him to master one particular style of his which was tongue twisting. This artist also proved himself to be the only local rapper with the ability to freestyle off the head with intelligent rhymes mixed with logic. Hammer did not want to waste time on Sarkodie so he quickly signed him for a five-year contract and created spaces on two of Ayigbe Edem’s songs (u dey craze and give it up) to introduce him before the recording of his debut album. However, after the release of Ayigbe Edem’s album, Sarkodie’s demand soared and the promotion of Ayigbe Edem’s album seemed to conflict with the timing of the recording of Sarkodie’s album. This resulted in a dispute that could have delayed Sarkodie’s recording. Hammer later agreed to let Sarkodie go as he wanted to focus all attention on Edem at the time. Sarkodie moved on to win the Artiste of the year 2010 at the 2010 Ghana Music Awards with his debut. Relationship between Hammer and Sarkodie was never affected by this as Sarkodie went on to name his album ‘makye’ which was given to him by Hammer upon their first meeting. Their latest project \\"Saa Okodie No\\", which was produced by hammer was recently aired on 106 & Park and contributed to Sarkodie's nomination at the recent BET Awards 2012 where he won the Best International Act. =Offcamp production= Hammer is also responsible for the big break of New York based Ghanaian Hip-hop artist Blitz the Ambassador, when he featured Blitz on a couple of his productions like Deeba, and Obrafour's (\\"who born u by mistake\\"). In between the recordings of Hammer’s groomed iconic artists, he was occasionally contracted by executive producers to produce two or three songs on various albums of artists such as Deeba, Jay Dee, Joe Frasier, KK Fosu, Okyeame Kwame, Kwabena Kwabena and several others. These songs were produced by Hammer outside The Last Two camp. Discography ;Studio albums * 2003: The Execution Diary * 2004: Sounds Of Our Time * 2006: The Crusade Of The Lost Files Personal life In 2005, Hammer married Lydia Konadu Boateng. They were, however, divorced a year later. They had one child, Mary-Ann Nana Yaa Osei. In another relationship with television presenter Nana Aba Asante, two children (Edward Nana Poku Osei Jnr and Andrew Nana Kojo Osei) were born. This relationship did not end in marriage. At a press conference for one of his artists, Hammer was arrested for failing to appear in court on delay of child support maintenance payments. It is not clear which of the women caused the arrest but upon arrival at the police station with his lawyer, Nana Asante Bedi Otuo, the arrest was reversed and he was asked to appear in court on the next assigned date. Hammer currently lives in his retreat home in the outskirts of Accra, where he is working on his new compilation album as well as new artists Agyekum and Joey B. Hammer is also the current national director of Hiplife at MUSIGA (the Musicians Union of Ghana).

Life and career Knoche attended Mt. Lebanon School District, where he played basketball and tennis, winning a Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League doubles championship. In 1942, he enrolled in Washington & Jefferson College, playing baseball and the freshman basketball team. He then enlisted in the United States Navy to serve in World War II in 1943. Later, he attended Bethany College, again playing basketball and leading the team in scoring. He then attended University of Colorado, where he led his basketball team to the 1946 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and played baseball. Following his discharge from the military, he returned to W&J; to complete his degree, graduating in 1947. He then played for 2 years in the professional National Industrial Basketball League, leading his team in scoring both years. He was drafted by the failing Pittsburgh Ironmen in the 1947 BAA Draft. When his contract was then sold to the New York Knicks, Knoche demanded $2,500 () to play for the team, a demand that was not met. He served in the United States Navy as a Navy intelligence officer, in World War II, and the Korean War. He joined the CIA in 1953 as an analyst; he was fluent in Russian and the Fuzhou dialect. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, he briefed President John F. Kennedy. Even though he lacked the typical CIA resume, as having never served in operational capacity or in the clandestine operations, he was steadily promoted through the agency's ranks. On July 7, 1976 he became deputy director, serving under director George H.W. Bush. In that position, he was responsible for day-to-day agency operations. On January 12, 1977, he was honored as a recipient of the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. Presentation of the award was made in the East Room of the White House by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. Upon Bush's resignation from the CIA with the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter on January 20, 1977, Knoche became acting director. That day, he briefed Carter on the agency's ongoing clandestine operations. On January 21, 1977, he met with the president and delivered photo intelligence from Aerospace Data Facility-East.Burrows, William (1986). Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security.

The chorale cantata, part of Bach's second annual cycle, is based on the hymn in five stanzas \\"\\" by Elisabeth Cruciger, published in in 1524. The hymn, related to mysticism and comparing Jesus to the Morning star, matches two aspects of the prescribed gospel for the Sunday, the Great Commandment and a theological dispute about the term \\"Son of David\\". An unknown poet kept the first and last stanza for the first and last movement of the cantata, and paraphrased the inner stanzas as four movements, alternating recitative and aria. Bach set the first stanza as a chorale fantasia with the cantus firmus in the alto, adding sparkle by a \\"dancing\\" soprano and the illumination of a sopranino, which he used for the first time in his cantatas. In the four inner movements, all four vocal parts have their solo. A tenor aria is accompanied by an obbligato transverse flute, a part written for a virtuoso player. A bass aria is accompanied by an oboe and strings, acting as in a Venetian concerto. The cantata is closed with a simple four-part setting of the hymn tune. Bach performed the cantata again in later years, with minor changes to the scoring.  History and text  Bach wrote the cantata in 1724 for the 18th Sunday after Trinity as part of his second annual cycle of mostly chorale cantatas. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul's thanks for grace of God in Ephesus (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Great Commandment (), also mentioning that the byname \\"Son of David\\" was discussed in a \\"theological dispute\\" of Jesus and the pharisees. The cantata text of an unknown author is based exclusively on the hymn \\"\\" in five stanzas by Elisabeth Cruciger (1524). The hymn is based on a Latin Christmas hymn, \\"Corde natus ex parentis\\", by Aurelius Prudentius. It is the first hymn by a Lutheran reformer which continues late medieval mysticism. Martin Luther appreciated the hymn so much that he placed it at the beginning of an early hymnal, . The chorale was originally associated with Epiphany, but also with the 18th Sunday after Trinity. The hymn's first and last stanza in their original wording became the outer movements, as usual in Bach's chorale cantatas. The unknown librettist paraphrased stanzas 2 and 3 to the cantata's respective movements, and stanza 4 to movements 4 and 5. The Gospel asks how Jesus, of David's descent as said in , can also be David's Lord, as claimed in . The hymn tries to answer this question, comparing Jesus to the Morning star, an image also used in the hymn \\"\\", the base for Bach's cantata . Bach performed the cantata at least three times, first on 8 October 1724, a second time probably on 24 October 1734 when the sopranino was replaced by a violino piccolo, and a third time probably on 1 October 1740. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff suggested performances in 1744/47, Klaus Hofmann in 1747, when the corno part was given to a trombone.  Music  = Structure and scoring = Bach structured the cantata in six movements, framing alternating recitatives and arias by an opening chorale fantasia and a closing four-part chorale. He scored it for soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloists, a four-part choir, and an ensemble of Baroque instruments: horn (Co) or (later) trombone to enforce the hymn tune, flauto traverso (Ft), flauto piccolo (Fp) or (later) violino piccolo, two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), and basso continuo. The title page of the autograph score reads: \\"Concerto. / Dominica 18. post. Trinit: / Herr Christ der einge Gottes Sohn etc. / a / Traversiere / 2 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola / Canto / Alto / Tenore / Basso / e / Continuo. / d. J.S. Bach\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown. = Movements =  1  As in most cantatas of the second cycle, Bach set the opening chorus on the first stanza of the hymn in its original wording, \\"\\" (Lord Christ, only Son of God), as chorale fantasia. He assigned the cantus firmus to the alto, enforced by a horn (in later performance replaced by trombone). Bach had a used a cantus firmus in the alto already in his chorale cantata , for the second Sunday after Trinity. In , this leaves the sopranos free, as the musicologist Julian Mincham notes, \\"to dance their own hymn of joy in the upper register above the chorale tune, thus lightening the texture and mood of the entire chorus\\". An unusual flauto piccolo or sopranino recorder is used to illustrate the sparkling of the morning star. Hofmann notes that it was the Bach's first use of a sopranino in a cantata, and the first introduction of his Leipzig audience to the instrument which had not been used as a concert instrument. In a later performance (probably 1734) it was replaced by a violino piccolo. The choral setting is polyphonic in the three other voices and embedded in instrumental music based on similar motifs.  2  The first recitative for alto, \\"\\" (O wondrous power of love), is secco, only accompanied by the continuo. It refers to Jesus as descendant of David and son of Mary, reflecting the Virgin birth. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted in 2000 the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage and performed this cantata in Leipzig's Thomaskirche, notes that the cantata's two recitatives are \\"exemplary even by Bach's standards in their economy of means and richness of expression. Mincham notes that a \\"flowing bass line\\" is heard when one line is quoted from the hymn, referring to \\"the end of earthly time\\".  3  The tenor aria, \\"\\" (Ah, draw my soul with skeins of love), is accompanied by the transverse flute, probably played by the flauto piccolo player of the first movement. As for , written some weeks before, Bach seems to have had an excellent flute player at hand, whom he used in twelve cantatas in the fall of 1724. Some musicologists think that he was Friedrich Gottlieb Wild, a law student.  4  The recitative for soprano, \\"\\" (Ah, lead me, o God, to the right path), is a prayer for God's guidance.  5  The bass aria illustrates the words \\"\\" (Soon to the right, soon to the left my erring steps lean) in jagged motifs and a frequent switch between winds and strings. In the middle section steady steps picture \\"\\" (Yet go with me, my Savior). The final part combines both elements. Gardiner notes that Bach uses the winds and strings in concerting choirs (cori spezzati), enforced by positioning them on galleries, one of them right, the other left of the singers. The technique had been practised in Venice in the late sixteenth century and introduced in Germany by composers such as Heinrich Schütz who studied in Venice. Gardiner observes also a hint at the style of French opera which Bach may have heard, traveling as a boy in northern Germany, at the Hamburg opera, in Celle or Lüneburg.  6  The closing chorale,\\"\\" (Kill us through your goodness), is a four-part setting for the choir, horn, oboes and strings playing colla parte with the voices.

History He was introduced to the public as a ventriloquist and was a finalist in the 1986/87 edition of the RaiUno program Fantastico 7 with his dummy Sergio. In 1985 he worked as a stand-in for Renato Pozzetto in the movie È arrivato mio fratello. Immediately after, he had a small part in Grandi magazzini and performed in many commercials. In 1987 in Soldati – 365 all’alba, he played a gay recruit. Thanks to his expressive skills and to his surreal acting, similar to the already mentioned Renato Pozzetto, Ghislandi has been often been asked to play roles as character actor, working both in the cinema and on television, without until recently getting lead roles. He boasts roles in important films like Il muro di gomma of Marco Risi, I mitici – Colpo gobbo a Milano of Carlo Vanzina, Vajont and Porzûs of Renzo Martinelli and, recently, was one of the actors chosen by Leonardo Pieraccioni in his successful movies (Il principe e il pirata, Il paradiso all’improvviso and Ti amo in tutte le lingue del mondo). Pietro Ghislandi is known to the general public for being the one and only Italian ventriloquist. His comic quality is a bit fanciful and nonstandard for television cabaret comedy. Voice is an important element of his show entitled \\"The left ventriculus\\" that is on tour through Italy. His \\"vocal\\" experiences include the well-known cartoonist Bruno Bozzetto and the dubbing of the most famous characters of the Italian \\"Walt Disney\\". He is also known for his roles in two national commercials. (Acqua Uliveto with Alessandro Del Piero and Caffè Kimbo with Gigi Proietti).

It replaced the previous Mk 6A helmet and Mk 6 helmet, introduced in 2005 and 1982 respectively. The Mk 7 helmet was introduced in June 2009 as an UOR (urgent operational requirement). The new helmet offers the same ballistic protection as the Mk6A helmet, but its new shape allows a soldier to lie flat and shoot straight, without the rear rim digging into his body armour and tipping the front rim over his eyes. The Mk 7 helmet is lighter than its predecessor – 1 kg instead of 1.5 kg for the Mark 6 helmet – and has better chin strapping for stability. It is produced in a new colour - tan, unlike the Mk 6A in black and Mk 6 in olive. It has been adopted for use in Afghanistan. The ballistic protection is measured with V50 and for the Mk 7 it is about 650 m/s. (V50 is the mean penetration velocity. At this velocity, half (50%) of projectiles are expected to penetrate.) The Mk 7 helmet is being replaced by the Revision Military Batlskin Cobra Plus helmet as part of the Virtus programme. In Ukraine, in 2014, due to a lack of adequate protection for members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces participating in the War in Eastern Ukraine, hundreds of Mk 7 helmets were purchased in the UK, and used by Ukrainian servicemen; together with the earlier Mk 6 and Mk 6A.

Calcagno and the Venetian Inquisition Initially laicized and expelled from the order of Franciscans for his rebellious attitude and beliefs, Calcagno nevertheless continued to parody the Catholic Church and its beliefs, and to celebrate the Mass in spite of being forbidden from doing so. At the age of 22 he was interrogated in Brescia on 15 July 1550 after an investigation by the Holy Office of the Venetian Inquisition relating to the offenses of atheistic blasphemy and sodomy. A witness familiar with Calcagno testified that the Franciscan slept with a boy almost every night, believed that Jesus engaged in sodomy with St. John, and denied the existence of God and Paradise, as well as the immortality of the human soul.Tucker, Scott (1997). The Queer Question: Essays on Desire and Democracy. Boston: South End Press. . p. 46. Calcagno admitted his guilt and mentioned that he had once talked to a certain Mr. Lauro di Glisenti da Vestone, an atheist who \\"said he didn't believe in anything, only what you could see with your eyes,\\" and replied \\"Well then you can believe or say anything you want about Christ no matter how bad, like that he kept Saint John as his boy.\\" He also argued that Paul the Apostle had condemned sodomy in his writings because he enjoyed the practice and wanted to keep it to himself.Dall'Orto, Giovanni (2004). \\"'Nature is a Mother Most Sweet': Homosexuality in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Italian Libertinism\\". In Gary P. Cestaro (Ed.), Queer Italia: Same-Sex Desire in Italian Literature and Film (pp. 83-104). New York: Palgrave Macmillan. . Calcagno also told the inquisitors that he had been influenced in his opinions by La cazzaria, a homoerotic 1530 dialogue by Antonio Vignali that was discreetly (but widely) circulated at the time.Gianetti, Laura (2009). Lelia's Kiss: Imagining Gender, Sex, and Marriage in Italian Renaissance Comedy. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. . p. 163. The report of the Brescian Tribunal was forwarded to the Council of Ten and Calcagno was executed in Venice on 23 December 1550.

The species epithet crassifolia means \\"thick-leaved\\", while the epithet in the synonym Bergenia cordifolia means \\"cordate (heart-shaped) leaf\\" (although the leaves may also be described as spoon-shaped). The cultivar 'Rosa Zeiten' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Description Growing in clumps It grows to about tall. The leaves are winter hardy in warmer climates and change colour in the range of rust brown to brown-red. The rhizome is creeping, fleshy, thick, reaching several meters in length and 3.5 cm in diameter, with numerous root lobes, highly branched, located near the soil surface, turning into a powerful vertical root. The stem is thick, leafless, glabrous, pink-red, 15-50 cm high. Leaves are in a basal dense rosette (wintering under the snow), dark green, which redden by autumn, with an almost rounded blade and a membranous sheath remaining up to two to three years. The leaf blade is broadly elliptical or almost rounded, rounded or chordate at the base, obtuse or indistinctly dentate, 3–35 cm long, 2.5–30 cm wide, on wide petioles not exceeding the length of the plate, equipped at the base with membranous vaginal stipules . =Flowers and fruits= Flowers are small, regular, lacking bracts, in apical thick paniculately-corymbiform inflorescence, usually two for long reddish leafless peduncle length of 4 cm. Calyx is naked half dissected into five oval top rounded lobes of up to 4 mm; petals obovate or broadly ovate, with a wide short marigold, 10-12 mm long, 6-8 mm wide, with a blunt-rounded apex and many veins, purple-red or pink. The stamens are twice as long as the calyx, and there are ten of them. Pistil has a semi-lower ovary, deeply divided into two (three) columns with wide stigmas. The fruit is an ellipsoidal, dry capsule with two diverging lobes opening along the abdominal suture. Seeds are numerous, oblong, smooth, glabrous, faceted, almost black, up to 2 mm long. The plant blooms in late spring and early summer before the appearance of young leaves. The seeds ripen in mid or late summer. Cultivation It is a widely-grown garden plant; cultivars include Bergenia cordifolia 'Purpurea', Bergenia cordifolia 'Winterglut', Bergenia cordifolia 'Senior', and Bergenia crassifolia 'Autumn Red'. It mainly reproduces vegetatively (by segments of rhizomes), but reproduction by seeds is not excluded. As an ornamental plant, it has been known in culture since the middle of the 18th century, it is used for landscaping, in stone gardens, arrays of shrubs and trees. Gardeners bred several forms with flowers of various colors. The plant prefers semi-shady and shady places with moderately dry, fertile soil. Propagated by dividing the bush in the fall. Uses Bergenia crassifolia is used as a tea substitute in its native Siberia, Altay and Mongolia. For medicinal purposes, rhizomes are used, which are collected by hand, cleaned and washed in cold running water. Large rhizomes are cut into long pieces. After preliminary drying, they are dried in the shade or in a well-ventilated area, laid out in a layer of 5 cm on paper or fabric. Leaves are used much less often. It is used in tanning sole and Russian leather, as well as the impregnation of nets and tarpaulins . The raw materials collected high in the mountains contain more tannides than in the low mountains. =Medicine= The medicinal properties of the plant have long been used in Russian folk medicine, as well as in the medicine of Tibet and China. Aqueous extracts of rhizome and leaves inside are used for colitis and enterocolitis of a non-infectious nature, tuberculosis, acute and chronic pneumonia, pulmonary haemorrhage, influenza and some other infections, laryngitis, headaches, fevers, articular rheumatism and gastrointestinal diseases.Encyclopedic Dictionary of Medicinal, Essential Oil and Poisonous Plants / Comp.

History Founded in 1974, initially as an extension of Seattle Hebrew Academy in Seattle, Washington, Northwest Yeshiva was founded to incubate a Jewish environment for higher college preparatory learning in the region. In 1992, it moved to Mercer Island, Washington to the campus that it occupies today. Rabbi Bernie Fox retired in 2016 as Head of School after 31 years in the position. Jason Feld, former dean of students at Shalhevet High School, assumed the role of Head of School in July 2017. Facilities The school's campus includes a sanctuary for prayer, multifunctional classrooms, STEM Lab, science and computer labs, a lunchroom, and an outdoor sport court. Curriculum Northwest Yeshiva's curriculum is integrated, encompassing both Judaic studies, including comprehensive Torah study that emphasis the development of critical thinking skills, as well as College Preparatory Academics. The school is accredited by the Northwest Accreditation Commission (NWAC). =Judaic Studies= As a pioneer of forward-thinking Modern Orthodox Jewish education, NYHS is deeply committed to providing students with an extraordinary Judaic education that is intellectually engaging, spiritually inspiring, and rooted in traditional text and tradition. In addition to an academically rigorous general studies program, NYHS offers a robust, deep and meaningful educational experience, both philosophically and in practice, to its students. The curriculum is designed to provide learners with the skills and knowledge necessary to become not just effective community leaders, but also ethical, thinking individuals. In 2019, Rabbi Naftali Rothstein joined the faculty as the Campus Rabbi. Rabbi Dr. Jeremy Wieder, a Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University, is the school's Halachic (Jewish law) authority. =College Preparatory Studies= The school's College Preparatory Studies program focuses on critical thinking, curiosity, positive engagement with the community, and providing a secular preparatory education. NYHS offers College in the High School courses in which students can earn University of Washington college credit. Currently, NYHS offers this option for Calculus A & B, Biology, Expository Writing, and Human Physiology. Freshmen have the opportunity to take a full STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) curriculum thanks to NYHS's partnership with the Center for the Initiatives in Jewish Education and the SAMIS Foundation. Athletics A member of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA), within the State Class IB, Northwest Yeshiva competes in multiple sports. The school changed its name from the 613s, a reference to the Torah's total number of mitzvot or commandments,to the Lions in memory of Ari Grashin Z\\"L, a student of NYHS who died in 2002. Ari means Lion in Hebrew. The Lions compete in men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, and mixed cross-country, golf, and track. In 2010, a WIAA State Girls' Basketball Tournament conflicted with Purim's Fast of Esther. The school's team, who had made it to State for the first time, had to balance religious obligations with playing and, in the end, decided there would be \\"no forfeit of faith,\\" garnering significant media coverage. Again in 2011, a WIAA State Girls' Volleyball Tournament conflicted, this time with Sabbath. Northwest's team once again decided \\"no forfeit of faith.\\" Affiliations * Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle * Samis Foundation References External links * Schools in Seattle High schools in King County, Washington Jewish schools Private high schools in Washington (state) Orthodox yeshivas in the United States Jewish day schools in Washington (state) ","title":"Northwest Yeshiva High School"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your ETH🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",R]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/13.md","filePath":"guide/13.md"}'),F={name:"guide/13.md"},E=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,E as default};
