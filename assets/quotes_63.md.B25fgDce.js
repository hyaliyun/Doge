It upgrades the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) for aircraft carriers and large-deck amphibious ships. A core component of non-Aegis combat systems, ACDS provides the capability to identify and classify targets, prioritize and conduct engagements, vector interceptor aircraft to targets, and exchange targeting information and engagement orders within the battle group and among different service components in the joint theater of operations. ACDS integrates the ship's sensors, weapons, and intelligence sources to allow command and control of battle group tactical operations. The ACDS upgrade is divided into two phases designated as Block 0 and Block 1. The Block 0 system replaces obsolete Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) computers and display consoles with modern equipment and incorporates both new and upgraded NTDS software. Block 1 operates with the equipment provided under ACDS Block 0 but implements significant improvements in software capability. The Block 1 upgrade includes modifiable doctrine, the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) for joint and allied interoperability, increased range and track capability, multi-source identification, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) based digital maps, and an embedded training capability. Program Status ACDS Block 0 was deployed in nine aircraft carriers, five Wasp-class amphibious assault ships, and all five Tarawa-class amphibious assault ships. The first installation of ACDS Block 1 began in FY 1996 with the USS Eisenhower (CVN-69) and Wasp (LHD-1), followed by the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) in 1999 and USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7) and USS Nimitz (CVN-68) in 2001. ACDS will be replaced with the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS) Mark 2 as it is fielded across the fleet.

The organisation's main objective is empowerment of women by providing them employment opportunities. Started in 1959 by seven women in Mumbai with a seed capital of only Rs.80 ($1.5), it had an annual turnover of more than Rs. 800 crore (over $109 million) in 2018. It provides employment to 43,000 (in 2018) women across the country. Primarily a cottage industry, urban by its origin, which has spread to the rural areas, it had an annual Rs. 290 million worth of exports in 2010. It is considered as one of the most remarkable entrepreneurial initiatives by women that is identified with female empowerment in India.Seema Sharma and Kanta Sharma. Encyclopaedia of Indian Women. Vol. VII: Women Employment. New Delhi, Anmol, 2005, 11 vols., cxliii, 4476 p., History Lijjat was the brain child of seven Gujarati women from Bombay (now Mumbai). The women lived in Lohana Niwas, a group of five buildings in Girgaum. They wanted to start a venture to create a sustainable livelihood using the only skill they had i.e. cooking. The seven women were Jaswantiben Jamnadas Popat, Parvatiben Ramdas Thodani, Ujamben Narandas Kundalia, Banuben. N. Tanna, Laguben Amritlal Gokani, Jayaben V. Vithalani, and Chutadben Amish Gawade. The women borrowed Rs 80 from Chhaganlal Karamsi Parekh, a member of the Servants of India Society and a social worker. They took over a loss-making papad making venture by one Laxmidas bhai, and bought the necessary ingredients and the basic infrastructure required to manufacture papads. On 15 March 1959, they gathered on the terrace of their building and started with the production of 4 packets of papads. They started selling the papads to a known merchant in Bhuleshwar. From the beginning, the women had decided that they would not approach anyone for donations or help, even if the organisation incurred losses. Chhaganlal Parekh, popularly known as Chaganbapa, became their guide. Initially, the women were making two different qualities of papads, to sell the inferior one at a cheaper rate. Chaganbapa advised them to make a standard papad and asked them never to compromise on quality. He emphasised to them the importance of running it as a business enterprise and maintaining proper accounts.Pathak, Ramnarayan Nagardas, Punyashlok Chhaganbapa, translated into English by Prof.V.T.Yardi, Published by Shri Mahila Griha Udyag Lijjat Papad, Jan. 1980, p.114-117 Lijjat expanded as a cooperative system. Initially, even younger girls could join, but later eighteen was fixed as the minimum age of entry. Within three months there were about 25 women making papads. Soon the women bought some equipment for the business, like utensils, cupboards, stoves, etc. In the first year, the organisation's annual sales were Rs. 6196. The broken papads were distributed among neighbours. During the first year, the women had to stop production for four months during the rainy season as the rains would prevent the drying of the papads. The next year, they solved the problem by buying a cot and a stove. The papads were kept on the cot and the stove below the cot so that the process of drying could take place in spite of the rains. The group got considerable publicity through word of mouth and articles in vernacular newspapers. This publicity helped it increase its membership. By the second year of its formation, 100 to 150 women had joined the group, and by the end of the third year it had more than 300 members. By this time, the terrace of seven founders could no longer accommodate the members and the ingredients, so the kneaded flour was distributed among the members who would take it to their homes and make papads. The papads were brought back for weighing and packaging. An attempt to start a branch in Malad suburb of Mumbai, in 1961, was unsuccessful.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1,Issue 3, March 1979, p.6. In 1962, the name Lijjat (Gujarati for \\"tasty\\") was chosen by the group for its products. The name, suggested by Dhirajben Ruparel, was chosen in a contest held for the purpose, with prize money of Rs. 5. The organisation was named Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad. In many Indian languages, Mahila means women, Griha means home, Udyog means industry. By 1962‚Äì63, its annual sales of papads touched 182,000. In July 1966, Lijjat registered itself as a society under the Societies Registration Act 1860. In the same month, on Chaganbapa's recommendation, U N Dhebar, the chairman of KVIC personally inspected the Lijjat. KVIC or Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission is a statutory body set up by the Government of India for development of rural industries. In September 1966, KVIC formally recognised Lijjat as a unit belonging to the \\"processing of cereals and pulses industry group\\" under the Khadi and Village Industries Act. It was also recognised as a \\"village industry\\". In 1966, KVIC granted it a working capital of Rs. 800,000 (0.8 million) and was allowed certain tax exemptions. An attempt to start a branch in Sangli town, in 1966, was unsuccessful. The first branch outside Maharashtra was established at Valod, Gujarat in 1968. After tasting tremendous success with their papads, Lijjat began producing other products like khakhra (1974), masala (1976), vadi, wheat atta, and bakery products (1979). In the 1970s, Lijjat set up flour mills (1975), printing division (1977) and polypropylene packing division (1978). The group also initiated some unsuccessful ventures such as cottage leather (1979), matches (1979), and agarbattis (incense sticks).Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1, Issue 3, March 1979, pp.7‚Äì11 In July 1979, the general secretary of a trade union tried to interfere in Lijjat's affairs, making certain demands on behalf of a few member-sisters. L. C. Joshi, Labour Advocate of Bombay and a well-known industrial relations expert, was called for consultations. In his observations on \\"Who owns Lijjat?\\", he clarified that member-sisters were competent to take a decision for their own and it was not open for an outside agency to interfere with the internal working of Lijjat.Irresponsible Trade Union Activities in Lijjat, Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1, Issue 11, Jan.1980, p.3-5 In 1985, the Lijjat branch at Jabalpur was taken over by one Shantilal Shah as his own unit, which he ran with the help of a Sanchalika (branch head), who was wife of his employee. Lijjat went through tremendous pressures and court stay orders to retrieve the situation.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.6, Issue 12, February 1985, pp.5‚Äì6. In 1987, Lijjat purchased new premises at Kamal Apartments in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai. The registered office shifted to the Bandra with effect from July 1988. In 1988, Lijjat entered the soap market with Sasa detergent and soap.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 11, Issue 8, Dec. 1988, p.7. Sasa had annual sales of Rs 500 million, accounting for 17 percent of Lijjat's total turnover in 1998. In March 1996, the 50th branch of Lijjat was inaugurated in Mumbai.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 17, Issue 4, April 1996 p.3 In the 1980s, Lijjat also started taking part in several trade fairs and exhibitions, which improved its sales and made the brand name \\"Lijjat\\" well known among the people. The advertising was undertaken through the vernacular newspapers, television and radio. The institution sponsored programs and gave away gifts for the winners of specific shows in the television.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 18, Issue 3, March 1997, 8 The money for advertisements was spent by the Polypropylene Division, which recovered the same by adding it to the price of the bags that it supplied to all the branches and divisions throughout India.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 6, Issue 7, Sept. 84, p.6; Vol. 8, issue 2, April, 86, p.3; Vol. 9, issue 10, Jan. 87, p.3. In the 1980s and 1990s, Lijjat started attracting attention of foreign visitors and officials. The Vice- President of Uganda, Dr. Speciosa Wandira-Kazibwe, visited Lijjat's central office in January 1996, since she wanted to start a similar institution in Uganda.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.17, Issue 2, Feb. 96, pp.1, 4. Lijjat started exporting its products with the help of merchant importers in the United Kingdom, the United States, the Middle East, Singapore, the Netherlands Thailand, and other countries. Its annual exports accounted for more than US$2.4 million in 2001. As its popularity grew, Lijjat started facing the problem of fake Lijjat papads being introduced in the market. In June 2001, three persons were arrested in this connection, in Bihar. Lijjat's website explains the identification features of original Lijjat papads. Lijjat received the \\"Best Village Industries Institution\\" award from KVIC for the period 1998‚Äì99 to 2000‚Äì01. In 2002, the \\"Businesswoman of the Year\\" award was given to \\"The Women Behind Lijjat Papad\\" at The Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence. At the awards ceremony, the President of Lijjat urged the State Governments of Maharashtra and Punjab to reconsider their decision of withdrawing the tax exemption on Lijjat's Sasa Detergent. In 2002, Lijjat had a turnover of Rs 3 billion and exports worth Rs. 100 million. It employed 42,000 people in 62 divisions all over the country. The 62nd branch became operational at Jammu and Kashmir in 2002, enrolling over 150 members. In 2003, Lijjat received the \\"Best Village Industry Institution\\". It also received the PHDCCI Brand Equity Award 2005. Lijjat marked its 50th year of existence on 15 March 2009. Organization structure and management Lijjat believes in the philosophy of sarvodaya and collective ownership. It accepts all its working members as the owners and an equal partaker in both profit and loss. The members are co-owners and fondly referred to as \\"sisters\\". All the decisions are based on consensus and any member-sister has the right to veto a decision.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 6, Issue 10, Dec. 1984, p.4-B Men can only be salaried employees (accountants, drivers or security guards), and not the members of the organisation (i.e. they are not the owners). Lijjat organisation structure The running of the organisation is entrusted to a managing committee of twenty-one members, including the President, the Vice- President, two secretaries, and two treasurers. Sanchalikas are in-charge of various branches and divisions. The office bearers of the managing committee and the sanchalikas are chosen from among the member-sisters on the basis of consensus every three years .{{cite web url=https://www.badabusiness.com/articles/lijjat-papad-company-a-story-of- women-empowerment/ title=Lijjat Papad Company ‚Äì A Story of Women Empowerment publisher=vivek bindra accessdate=21 November 2019 date=21 November 2019 Each branch has a committee of eleven member-sisters, again chosen by consensus. The central office at Mumbai previously coordinated the activities of various branches. But, as the organisation grew, the authority was decentralised in terms of work and sharing of profits at the branch level. However, the sanchalikas still need the managing committee's approval before they undertake any new project or activity. All the branches follow the same set of instructions and have similar accounting system. To co-ordinate various branches in a region or state, there are branch co-ordination committees and area meetings of the various branches in a state. The annual general meeting is attended by member-sisters representing branches and divisions from all over India. Currently, Lijjat has branches in seventeen Indian states ‚Äì Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Account books are easily accessible to all the member-sisters, ensuring transparency. Lijjat follows its own financial accountability principle. There is no credit method for running operations in the organisation. Every payment is done on a daily basis, except for the outside supply of raw material. Profits and losses are shared equally among the members of a given branch. In the initial days of Lijjat, the profits of the first six months were shared equally among all sisters in the form of gold. This sharing practice is still in effect, but now the decision whether to share the profits in gold or in cash is made at the branch level. The cost of national-level advertising is borne by all branches and divisions, depending on their individual production abilities. The quality of papads can vary due to quality of water used in various parts of India. To avoid any inconsistencies, the final products are tested in the Lijjat's laboratory in Mumbai. In the monthly meetings, the quality issue and modifications are tested. The central office purchases and distributes all ingredients to maintain the quality of the final product. For example, the urad dal is imported from Myanmar, asafetida is imported from Afghanistan, and black pepper comes from Kerala. The committee often makes surprise visits to various branches to assure that production conditions are hygienic. When a new branch of Lijjat opens, a neighbouring Lijjat branch helps it by guiding and training new members. On successive failures of a branch to abide by the organisation's philosophy of consistent quality and production of papads, the central committee reduces the daily wages of its members by 1 rupee. The member-sisters are also rewarded for extra effort. For instance, in 2002, the member-sisters at the Rajkot branch received Rs 4,000 each as bonus, while the member sisters at Mumbai and Thane branches received a 5-gram gold coin as an incentive. Several issues of Lijjat Patrika enumerate the names of the names/numbers of the member-sisters, who were rewarded with the cash or gold, for their extra efforts. Lijjat collection flowchart Lijjat distribution flowchart Products and divisions Lijjat manufactures several products, of which the papad is the most famous: * Papad (Fourteen flavours, including lasan, moong, mirch, Punjabi and urad) * Khakhra * Appalam * Masala * Vadi * Gehu Atta (Wheat flour) * Bakery products * Chapati * Lijjat has several divisions and manufacturing units: * Flour Division (Vashi) * Masala Division and Quality Control Laboratory (Cotton Green) * Printing Division (Cotton Green) * Advertising Division, Bandra Culture Lijjat Patrika, the in-house magazine, is published and circulated for a nominal rate to those interested in the activities of Lijjat. It is published in many languages Hindi, English, Marathi, Gujarati. It has emerged as a strong mode of communication for information related to significant events and initiatives at Lijjat, in addition to presenting articles on women. Member sisters across all branches of Lijjat recite an all-religion prayer before beginning their daily activities. The sisters are free to choose their activities and each activity is given equal importance. Leaving the organisation is voluntary. No member sister can be asked to leave unless or until she goes against the organizational principles. There is no fixed retirement age at Lijjat. Once, when the president Jyoti Naik was questioned about this anomaly, she said that there was no need to make provision for a retirement age, as the emphasis obviously was on earning one's bread through daily work, all through one's life. Role in women empowerment The growth of the Lijjat is often seen in the larger canvas of women and their empowerment. The organisation has undertaken various efforts to promote literacy and computer education for member-sisters and their families. A literacy campaign for sisters began through literacy classes at Girgaum on 18 June 1999. Later, the managing committee decided to start such classes in all its branches. From 1980 onwards, Lijjat started giving Chhaganbapa Smruti Scholarships to the daughters of the member-sisters.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.2, Issue 6, August 1980, p.5; Vol.2, Issue 7, Sept. 1980;Vol. 6, Issue 4, June 1984, p.4; Vol.6, Issue 7, Sept. 1984, p.3; Vol.7, Issue 7, Sept. 1985, p.3; Vol. 7, Issue 8, Oct. 85, p.6 The member-sisters used their organisation as a medium to promote their and their families' welfare. In the Valod centre, they set up an educational and hobby centre for the rural women. Orientation courses in typing, cooking, sewing, knitting and toy making as well as other courses like child welfare, first aid and hygiene were taught.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1, Issue 12, Feb. 1980, p.7 The first ever pucca (tarred) road in Valod to be built and inaugurated in 1979 was with the help of the Lijjat, Valod branch.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1, Issue 6, June 1979, p.7 In 1979, Lijjat teamed up with UNICEF to organise a seminar in Mumbai on \\"Child Care and Mother Welfare\\", as part of the International Year of the Child celebrations.UNICEF-Lijjat Seminar of Child Care and Mother Welfare, Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 1, Issue 10, Dec.1979, p.4 In October 1984, Bhadraben Bhatt represented Lijjat at the UNESCO sponsored international workshop on \\"The role of women in the assimilation and spread of technological innovation\\" held at NITIE, Powai.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 6, Issue 9, Nov. 1984, p.7 Alkaben Kalia represented Lijjat at the national level meeting on women convened by the National Commission on Self Employed Women.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.10, Issue 9, Dec. 1987, p.3 At the behest of Mother Teresa, the member-sisters also took part in some activities of Asha Dhan, an institution to care for destitute women.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.1, Issue 10, p.4; Vol. 2, Issue 2, April 80, p.1;Vol. 2, issue 7, Sept.1980, p.4 Lijjat member- sisters also tried to start a co-operative bank, but the effort was not very successful.Lijjat Patrika, Vol.2, Issue 9, Nov.1980, p.4 Contribution to social service On several occasions, the Lijjat member-sisters have undertaken social service activities such as distributing nutritious food for poor children, donating money for conducting community marriage, instituting prize-money for spread of primary education, undertaking blood donation drive, organising health camps, plantation drives and even making donations to Government bodies. In 1999, the Mumbai City felicitated Rukminiben B. Pawar, Lijjat President, as an outstanding woman in the field of social work.Lijjat Patrika, Vol. 18, Issue 10, Oct. 1997, p.16 Lijjat undertook the rehabilitation of Chincholi (Jogan), the earthquake affected village in the Latur district of Maharashtra. The institution provided the finance and supervised the work of construction of fifty-eight houses for the people of the village.

The species is characterised by the highly developed appendage present on the underside of the lid. The specific epithet lingulata is derived from the Latin word lingula, meaning \\"small tongue\\", and refers to this unique morphological feature. Botanical history Nepenthes lingulata was discovered during a series of field trips to Sumatra between 2004 and 2005. The first collection of the species was made on April 22, 2005, south of Padang Sidempuan in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra. The formal description of N. lingulata was published in 2006 in the botanical journal Blumea. The herbarium specimen Lee, Hernawati, Akhriadi NP 432 was designated as the holotype. It is deposited at the Herbarium of Andalas University (ANDA). Description Nepenthes lingulata is a climbing plant.

Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. and is terete in cross section. Internodes are up to 9 cm long. rosette to a climbing vine Leaves are sessile and coriaceous in texture. The lamina of rosettes is lanceolate and up to 9.6 cm long and 3 cm wide. Climbing stems produce smaller leaves, with the elliptical-ovate lamina reaching 4.8 cm in length and 2.1 cm in width. Two longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Tendrils are up to 25 cm long in rosettes and up to 14 cm long in climbing stems. Rosette and lower pitchers are relatively large, reaching 28 cm in height and 4.5 cm in width. They are infundibular in the lower half and cylindrical in the upper half. The inner surface of the pitcher is only glandular in the lower half, with the waxy zone continuing to the top of the pitcher. A pair of wings (‚â§2.5 mm wide) with fringe elements up to 1 cm long runs down the front of the pitcher. The pitcher mouth is ovate and bears a flattened peristome up to 3 cm wide. The inner margin of the peristome is lined with a series of teeth up to 2 mm long. The lid or operculum is broadly triangular and may be up to 7.5 cm long and 5.5 cm wide. Curiously, no nectar glands are present on the underside of the lid. A single filiform appendage (‚â§4 cm long) hangs over the pitcher mouth, the apical end of which is covered with scattered raised nectar glands. A branched spur (‚â§1.5 cm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers are smaller than lower pitchers, growing to 12.3 cm in height and 2 cm in width. Their wings are reduced to ribs. The pitcher mouth is ovate to rounded and bears a rounded or slightly flattened peristome (‚â§4 mm wide). The lid measures up to 2 cm in length and 2 cm in width. As in lower pitchers, a single highly developed appendage is located on the underside of the lid. Nepenthes lingulata has a racemose inflorescence. In male plants, the peduncle is up to 2.3 cm long and the rachis up to 4.5 cm long, whereas in female plants the peduncle is up to 5.5 cm long and the rachis up to 3.5 cm long. Pedicels are around 3‚Äì4 mm long and bear a single flower. Sepals are ovate and around 2 mm long in male inflorescences and 5 mm long in female inflorescences. A very dense indumentum of long woolly grey-brown hairs is present on immature tendrils and the outer surface of pitchers. The hairs on the margins of the leaves are caducous. Scattered grey-brown stellate hairs cover the upper surface and margins of the lower surface of the lid. Leaves are dark green on their upper surface and pale green on their lower surface. The midrib and edges of the leaves are purple in some plants. Rosette plants have light green stems, which gradually become dark purple as the plant begins to climb. Tendrils are dark purple. As in the closely related N. izumiae, the pitchers are dark purple to black on their outer surface, while the inside surface is pale bluish-green with purple spots. Inflorescences are pale green. Sepals range in colour from light green to reddish-purple. Ecology Nepenthes lingulata is endemic to the Barisan Mountains that line the western side of Sumatra. It is known only from the type locality, south of Padang Sidempuan in North Sumatra. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1700‚Äì2100 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes lingulata grows in upper montane mossy forest. It occurs both terrestrially and as an epiphyte. In the wild, N. lingulata occurs sympatrically with N. bongso, N. dubia, N. gymnamphora, and N. jamban. A natural hybrid with N. jamban has been recorded. Carnivory The unique tongue-like appendage of N. lingulata Many Nepenthes species, including the closely related N. izumiae, have a glandular crest on the underside of the lid. However, the highly developed filiform appendage of N. lingulata is unique in its size. Nepenthes lingulata is also unusual in that the undersurface of the lid is completely devoid of glands, except for a small group concentrated at the end of the tongue-like appendage. This structure likely serves to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning. A similar trapping method is employed by the Bornean endemic N. bicalcarata, which has a pair of spines positioned over the pitcher mouth. However, in that species the spines are structures of the peristome and not the lid.Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.Clarke, C.M. & C.C. Lee 2004. Pitcher Plants of Sarawak. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Related species Nepenthes lingulata is thought to be most closely related to N. izumiae, with which it shares the general morphology and colouration of its pitchers. However, it can be easily distinguished from that species on the basis of the highly developed filiform appendage that hangs over the pitcher mouth. It also differs in having a triangular lid, as opposed to the orbicular lid of N. izumiae. Furthermore, N. lingulata completely lacks nectar glands on the underside of the lid and has a very dense woolly indumentum. Nepenthes lingulata is more distantly related to the Sumatran species N. densiflora, N. diatas, N. singalana, and N. spathulata.

It was inaugurated on August 23, 1951 and used until 1959 for transmitting the radio programme of SWF with a transmission power of 40 kW on 1538 kHz. As antenna, it used a 120 metre tall guyed ground-fed lattice steel mast radiator at 47¬∞47'10\\" N and 9¬∞31'16\\" E. In 1964 after Bodenseesender took over its task, it was given from SWF to German Federal Post (Deutsche Bundespost) and its frequency was changed to 755 kHz, in order to form a single frequency network with Cremlingen transmitter near Brunswick in Lower Saxony. Because this frequency, which allowed a much better groundwave propagation, was also used by Sottens transmitter in Switzerland, close to its 120 metre tall mast radiator, an 80 metre tall guyed reflector mast had to be built. In 1968 its transmission power was increased from 20 kW to 100 kW. To avoid jamming other stations, it had to be switched to 30 kW (or off) at night. This changed in the 1970s, when a new mast was built. The old mast was transformed into a reflector mast to allow the use of directional radiation. The waveplan of Geneva resulted in a frequency shift together with Cremlingen transmitter to 756 kHz, while Sottens transmitter got a new frequency. The radiation minimum toward Southwest was not required any more. However a new radiation minimum toward east-southeast in the direction of Timi»ôoara in Romania, where a station on the same frequency works, was necessary according to the waveplan of Geneva. To achieve this, a new 120 metre tall ground-fed guyed lattice steel mast radiator was built northwestwards of the old 120 metre mast at 47¬∞47'11 N and 9¬∞31'12\\" E. After its completion, the new mast worked as radiator, while the old mast got a reflector. The old 80 metre tall reflector mast, which became obsolete, was dismantled. With this antenna configuration operation with 100 kW was possible 24 hours per day, at daytime with omnidirectional and at nighttime with directional radiation. Both masts were dismantled on January 24, 2018.Municipality Horgenzell: Demolition of the mediumwave transmitter Ravensburg Masts The station uses as antenna two guyed mast radiators, situated at and . Both masts are 120 metres high and grounded. They were built in 1951 (eastern mast) and 1978 (western mast). Before 1964 the older mast was electrically divided into two parts by an intermediate insulator, still visible. The ladder on the mast at that spot runs outside. The older mast was guyed on three levels: the wires of the topmost guy were not divided by insulators, but by coils at the anchor points. The lower guys used insulators. The newer mast was guyed in two levels. All its guys were grounded via coils at the anchor points.

It is the only high school in the Urbana City School District and had a student enrollment of 509 in 2015‚Äì16. Athletic teams are known as the Hillclimbers and the school colors are maroon and white. UHS was rated as Excellent by the Ohio Department of Education in 2011 and 2012. History After creation of the district on April 28, 1849, the original high school building was constructed in 1874 with approved local bonds of initially $60,000, and later increased by $20,000. The last of these bonds were paid off in 1896, and unfortunately this building burnt down due to an unexplained fire on December 12, 1896. The flames from the fire were bright enough to be seen from Piqua, St. Paris, Springfield, and West Liberty. Insurance on the building, totaling $20,000 by the district, allowed for a new high school to be built on the same location as the original building. Construction was completed in the fall of 1897, and the building was designed to resemble a castle on top of the city's highest point, which became commonly referred to as \\"The Castle\\". An addition of a junior high building attached to the north end of the high school building was completed in 1930, with the castle then named the \\"William McK. Vance Building\\". On December 12, 1930, exactly 34 years after the original building had been destroyed in a fire, the high school building caught fire again. While the castle burned, the newly adjoined building was spared due to the implementation of fire-proof construction. The origin of this fire was also unknown, but the castle was immediately remodeled, and continued to function as class space for the Urbana Junior High School until April 2018. Further additions to the original buildings have been made over the years, with the most recent of these permanent additions completed in the mid 1950s. In November 2014, voters of the district approved a 7.15-mill, 28-year building levy for a new high school building on the current property of the high school and junior high school, along with consolidating the district's four (K-2, 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8) elementary and junior high buildings into a single facility. Construction was completed on a new building in April 2018. The new high school was built directly behind the current high school, allowing \\"The Castle\\" and the former gymnasium/auditorium building to remain standing on the hill and in use by the district. Extracurricular Activities Urbana High School features a variety of extracurricular activities. Within the music department, students can participate in concert band and choir, marching band, show choir, the annual musical, pep band, and jazz band. For leadership and community service experience, the Castle Chapter of the National Honor Society provides a number of community and school-wide outreach events each year, with only a select number of student admitted into the chapter during a student's junior and senior year. Students each spring also elect their respective classmates into positions on the Urbana High School Student Council. Other chapters and groups include a Future Farmers of America (FFA) chapter, Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA), and DECA. Athletics Athletic teams are known as the Hillclimbers and their mascot is named Sparky.

He was a prominent member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or the \\"Wobblies\\"), the most influential radical union of his time. In an era when few African Americans were permitted in American unions and fewer still belonged to more liberal organizations, Fletcher was nationally known. Fletcher helped lead Local 8, the largest, most powerful, and longest lasting interracial union of the World War I era.  Early life  Benjamin Harrison Fletcher was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1890. He worked as a day laborer and a longshoreman, loading and unloading ships. Fletcher joined the IWW and the Socialist Party around 1912. He first heard IWW soapbox speakers addressing working class audiences in riverside neighborhoods. Shortly thereafter, Fletcher became a leader of the IWW in Philadelphia, beginning a long career in public speaking that won him a great many accolades for his fine voice and incisive arguments for overthrowing capitalism.Ben Fletcher's biography in Libcom.org  IWW involvement  Fletcher was a prominent member of the IWW's Philadelphia branch of longshoremen, called the Local 8. In May 1913 thousands of longshoremen struck for better wages and union recognition; their new union‚Äîthe IWW. Following the strike, Fletcher led Local 8 and was celebrated in the Wobbly press, the IWW newspaper. Local 8 in general and Fletcher in particular seemed to prove one of the anti-capitalists' central tenets: race was used to divide workers who shared a more important identity, that of class, but unions could overcome that challenge. While this notion still is debated hotly, it is undeniable that thousands of African American longshoremen belonged on an equal terms to an organization that proved that interracialism was not only possible but essential to true working class might. That Local 8 remained a powerful force despite employer and governmental hostility indicates as much.  Treason arrest and sentence  As America formally entered World War I, Philadelphia became one of the most important ports for the war effort. Though they engaged in but a single work stoppage (Local 8‚Äôs anniversary was celebrated annually with a one-day strike), the federal government targeted Local 8‚Äôs leaders, Fletcher included, in its national raids on the IWW. Demonstrating his importance and singularity, Fletcher was the only African American among the hundred members of the IWW tried in 1918 for treasonous activities. While no direct evidence was provided against Fletcher, Local 8, or even the IWW (most of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù were statements of the IWW‚Äôs anti-capitalist beliefs, not any planned actions to interrupt the war effort), all of the defendants were found guilty‚Äîthe jury came back in under an hour, all guilty on all counts. Fletcher was fined $30,000 and sentenced to ten years in the Leavenworth federal penitentiary in Kansas. As the sentences were announced, the Wobbly leader Bill Haywood reported that, ‚ÄúBen Fletcher sidled over to me and said: ‚ÄòThe Judge has been using very ungrammatical language.‚Äô I looked at his smiling black face and asked: ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs that, Ben? He said: ‚ÄòHis sentences are much too long.‚Äô‚Äù While in jail, Fletcher‚Äôs release became a celebrated cause among African American radicals, championed by The Messenger, a monthly co-edited by A. Philip Randolph. Fletcher served around three years, before his sentence was commuted, along with most of the other jailed Wobblies, in 1922. Cole, Peter (2007). Wobblies on the Waterfront: Interracial Unionism in Progressive- era Philadelphia. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. page 90  Post- release and death  After his release, Fletcher remained committed to the IWW, though never played as active a role as he had prior to his imprisonment. He stayed involved in Local 8 but generally remained in the background. He still gave occasional speeches, on tours and street corners into the 1930s. Fletcher‚Äôs health failed while still young, typical of longshoremen and other manual laborers. He also moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn with his wife, where he worked as a building superintendent, until he died in 1949. He is buried in Brooklyn, New York.  Legacy  Alongside Hubert Harrison and Lovett Fort-Whiteman, Fletcher was one of the few African American leaders in the revolutionary IWW. The union that he helped lead for a decade, Local 8, stands as a rare example of interracial equality in the early 20th century.

This building was used for both elementary and high school classes. The elementary grades were on the first floor and the high school was located on the second floor. The first high school graduating commencement exercises in Mechanicsburg were held June 3, 1880, with two people graduating. In 1920 the front part of the East Elementary building was completed for $75,000 and addition to the rear of that building was completed in 1939 for $38,000. These two buildings met the needs of Mechanicsburg's expanding enrollment until 1950. At this time an additional building that included the front high school building was completed at a cost of $230,000. Two more additions were made in 1956 and 1975, making the total construction cost of the present Mechanicsburg School Buildings around $1,282,000. In 2003 voters approved a bond issue to construct a new K-12 building. The building was completed in 2007 at a cost of $24,542,000.

The party was formed at a conference of communist dissident fractions of the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion), held in Gomel August 10-15, 1919. Members of the party were nick-named 'EKOP-ists'. It was affiliated to the Jewish Communist Union (Poalei Zion).Document 20 IDC History EKP argued in favour of a merger with the Bund, to form a Jewish section of the Communist International. The proposed Jewish Comintern section would work under the aegis of the national communist party in each country, apart from Palestine. EKP was fiercely opposed to the Yevsektsiya, the Jewish Section of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The II All-Russian conference of the EKP was held in July 1920 in Kharkov. The IV Congress of was held in August 1921 and the III All-Russian conference was held 1-2 December 1922 in Moscow. The party was represented in the Council for Propaganda and Action of the Peoples of the East of the Communist International through Zajma Ostrovsky, who participated in the 1920 Congress of the Peoples of the East, held in Baku, Azerbaijan (part of Soviet Russia). In its later phase the party passed through severe internal disputes. The fact that the Komfarband merged with RCP(b) in March 1921 weakened the case for the formation of a Jewish Comintern section and sparked a debate on RCP(b)-EKP merger within the party. In 1922 the party merged into the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) and many of its members became involved in the Yevsektsiya. =In Baku= The EKP occupied a strong position in Baku after the arrival of the 11th Soviet Red Army. The Jewish population of the city grew considerably in those years because of the pogroms committed by the White Army in Ukraine Belarus and Russia that led many Jews to find shelter in Azerbaijan, a country without an antisemitic tradition. The fact that the Jewish population had grown up to 13,700 persons helped the EKP (as well as the Communist Bund, the Yevsektsiya and the Zionist parties) to enlarge its membership in the area. The EKP promoted many cultural activities and struggled for the eliminination of illiteracy, in particular among the Mountain Jews. In 1921 the betsalel circles were opened in Baku. In those places it was possible to organize literature and Jewish drama courses. Organization The party was led by a Central Committee and a Politburo. The organ of the Central Committee of EKP was Nakanune ('–ù–∞–∫–∞–Ω—É–Ω–µ'). In Ukraine, the party Central Committee had a Right-bank Bureau (Pravbirou) and a Left-bank Bureau. The Belorussian EKP was headed by a Chief Committee. Moreover, the party had a Caucasus Regional Committee. The youth wing of the party was called Jewish Communist Youth Union. EKP maintained a party school in Kharkov, named after Ber Borochov.

The last episode was broadcast on September 10, 1962. Synopsis One of CBS television's most popular and highly rated sitcoms of the 1950s, December Bride, starred Spring Byington and Harry Morgan as next-door neighbor Pete Porter. Pete spent most of his time complaining about his scatterbrained wife Gladys, who was unseen to viewers. In this spin-off series, Gladys emerges as the redhaired comedian Cara Williams. Pete is an insurance salesman, and the happy couple resides in Westwood, California. Besides leading-man Peter, another carryover from December Bride during the first season was the character of Hilda Crocker (Verna Felton), a close equivalent of I Love Lucys Ethel Mertz; she appeared in 23 episodes. Frances Rafferty, another December Bride veteran, appeared in seven episodes of Pete and Gladys as Nancy (a different character from her role in the original series).

The shows featured several characters, most performed by Sanchez, plus interviews with celebrities or the audience. It also featured a gossip section and discussions about social and political issues. On July 31, 2007, the show longtime hosts were replaced due to some differences. S√°nchez alleged in an interview that one of the main reasons was the lack of modern technical equipment in the radio station which they had been asking for years. They were replaced by veteran producer and host Luisito Vigoreaux, merengue singer Giselle, and Jorge Pab√≥n (known as \\"Molusco\\"). However, Pab√≥n quit shortly after to join another radio station. Vigoreaux and Giselle continued to host with various guests until the show was substituted on January 2008 by a new show, El Trabuco, hosted by Agust√≠n Rosario, Yan Ru√≠z, and Sonya Cort√©s.

Controversy and negative consumer reaction  The Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection sets have received intense negative consumer reaction, due to the edits in certain cartoons on each set. The first set contained three edited shorts (The Milky Waif, The Truce Hurts, and The Little Orphan), which Warner stated was a mistake. All three of these shorts originally included various characters in blackface. A replacement program was begun at the end of 2006, two years after the set's initial release. Warner Home Video has corrected the problem and the set can be purchased without any problems. The second volume contained four shorts (The Lonesome Mouse, Polka-Dot Puss, Saturday Evening Puss and Nit- Witty Kitty) with edited sound tracks. These four shorts contained the censored Mammy Two Shoes audio track, instead of the original. However, Warner corrected the problem and the discs do contain the original Mammy Two Shoes tracks. The final volume contained an edited version of His Mouse Friday (1951), in which the scene were Jerry meets a real black savage is cut. Consumers have also expressed disappointment at the fact that, although advertised as being \\"restored and remastered\\", none of the cartoons on the first volume are restored, having been sourced from the same transfers used for television. However, all widescreen/CinemaScope cartoons are restored in their original aspect ratios. Complaints also arose over Mouse Cleaning (1948) and Casanova Cat (1951) being omitted from Volume 3 because of racial stereotyping, according to a Warner Home Video press release. These two shorts were the only Tom and Jerry shorts from the Hanna-Barbera era not present on DVD. These two shorts can be found on the European Classic Collection DVDs.  Other notes on sets  * Due to an error, Texas Tom (1950) was accidentally included on both Volume 1 and Volume 2. * At the end of the commentary for Kitty Foiled (1947), commentary narrator Jerry Beck accidentally said Tom instead of Jerry (\\"There is Tom and his feathered friend\\" says Beck). * Touch√©, Pussy Cat! (1954), on Volume 1, uses an unreleased stereo mix of its soundtrack. This mix (if heard on certain sound systems) is missing a few lines of dialogue present in the mono mix, specifically the character Tuffy singing \\"Fr√®re Jacques\\" while painting an unflattering caricature of Tom (the score accompaniment to \\"Fr√®re Jacques\\" is still present in the soundtrack without the singing).Johnson, Gay (December 8, 2004). \\"Review of Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Volume 1.\\" Images Journal. * Touch√©, Pussy Cat! (1954) and Pup on a Picnic (1955) were originally produced simultaneously in standard Academy and CinemaScope formats. The CinemaScope versions (which are missing non-critical information present at the top, bottom and left sides of the frame in many shots from their Academy versions) are included on the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collections. In addition, Touch√©, Pussy Cat! is included on Volume 1 and presented in a 2.55:1 ratio correctly, while Pup on a Picnic is included on Volume 3, but presented in a 1.78:1 ratio instead of a 2.55:1 ratio, thereby cropping the left and right sides of the CinemaScope picture for the latter. * Two other shorts (Pet Peeve (1954) and Southbound Duckling (1955) on Volume 3) were originally produced simultaneously in standard Academy and CinemaScope formats. The CinemaScope versions of each of these shorts are missing non-critical information present at the top and bottom of the frame in many shots from their Academy versions. This is not an error, but a consequence of working in both aspect ratios. Contrary to the CinemaScope versions, the Academy versions are missing information present at the left and right sides of the frame in many shots from their CinemaScope versions. * Also, the Volume 2 DVD states that there are 40 shorts included. However, two shorts (Pet Peeve and Southbound Duckling) that are stated to be included on the DVD back cover and inside are missing from the disc they are stated to be on. They are on Volume 3. * Contrary to the other versions that were on MGM/UA Home Video, His Mouse Friday (1951) is included on Volume 3. However, it is presented in an edited version. The uncut version is not included on the set. All other cartoons are uncensored, with the exception of the two cartoons that were skipped entirely.

Irrational Man helped to introduce existentialism to the English-speaking world and has been identified as one of the most useful books that discuss the subject, but Barrett has also been criticized for endorsing irrationality and for giving a distorted and misleading account of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Summary Barrett discusses existentialism and its background, including the philosophical tradition to which existentialism was a reaction. He outlines the views of philosophers from Plato to Hegel, tracing the development of ideas about being, ontology, and metaphysics. He also attempts to explain how developments in science, economics, modern art and religion, including Protestantism, provided the background to existentialism. He argues that the modern world is becoming increasingly secularized and that faith has become \\"attenuated\\". He maintains that during the modern period, a questionable new \\"image of man\\" has emerged. Surveying trends in art, Barrett writes that the Dada movement was \\"one of the valid eruptions of the irrational in this century.\\" Four existentialist thinkers - Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre - receive extended discussion from Barrett, who explains their main ideas and philosophical terminology. Barrett more briefly discusses other existentialist thinkers such as Karl Jaspers, Nikolai Berdyaev, Martin Buber, Miguel de Unamuno, Gabriel Marcel, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as some artists and writers he considers existentialist, such as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, whom he compares to Nietzsche, crediting him with anticipating Nietzsche's insights into the will to power in Crime and Punishment (1866). Discussing Kierkegaard, Barrett maintains that the Danish philosopher is relevant even to non-Christians because of his \\"appeal to their own existence.\\" Barrett writes that, \\"Being a Christian, after all, is one way of being a man - for Kierkegaard personally it was the only way - and to have this way illumined, to be summoned to its tasks, is also to be called on to be a man, however divergent our own choice of a way may be.\\" Barrett adds that, \\"Kierkegaard stated the question of Christianity so nakedly, made it turn so decisively about the individual and his quest for his own eternal happiness, that all religious writers after him seem by comparison to be symbolical, institutional, or metaphorical - in a word, gnostic. Perhaps the very nakedness of Kierkegaard's statement of faith makes it impossible for Christianity to go anywhere but in the direction of some kind of gnosticism.\\" In his discussion of Nietzsche, Barrett writes that, \\"Nietzsche's fate is one the great episodes in man's historic effect to know himself. After him, the problem of man could never quite return to its pre-Nietzschean level.\\" Barrett calls Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-1891) Nietzsche's \\"most lyrical book\\" and \\"the expression of the loneliest Nietzsche.\\" Finally, Barrett applies existentialist thought to the world of the late 1950s, during the Cold War. Irrational Man includes two appendices, \\"Negation, Finitude, and the Nature of Man\\", which reprints a 1957 paper by Barrett, and \\"Existence and Analytic Philosophers\\", a highly technical discussion of existentialism in relation to analytic philosophy. Publication history Irrational Man was first published in 1958 by Doubleday & Company, Inc. Later editions include those published by Greenwood Press, Inc. in 1977 and Anchor Books in 1990. Reception Irrational Man received a positive review from Robert Jordan in The Nation. Later discussions of the book include those by Paul Stuewe in Quill & Quire, Andrew Pulver in The Guardian, and John Williams in The New York Times Book Review. Jordan described the book as a \\"spirited defense\\" of the methods and conclusions of existentialist philosophy. Stuewe described the book as \\"perhaps the best popular book on existentialism\\". Pulver identified the book as an influence on filmmaker Woody Allen, observing that the title of his film Irrational Man (2015) is clearly inspired by Barrett's book, which \\"no doubt formed part of Allen‚Äôs self-taught intellectual life in the late 50s and early 60s\\". The theologian John Macquarrie described Irrational Man as one of the most useful books about existentialism. In The Ominous Parallels (1982), the Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff presented Irrational Man as an example of a prominent philosopher endorsing irrationality, citing Barrett's comments about Dada. The philosopher Jon Stewart accused Barrett of caricaturing, and propagating myths about, Hegel. Stewart deemed Barrett guilty of misrepresenting Hegel as a \\"cosmic rationalist\\" who, like the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and some romantics, believed in a metaphysical world soul.

History Delta Dental's roots go back to 1954 with the formation of dental service corporations in California, Oregon, and Washington, which were created by dentists who recognized the need to increase access to oral health care. Led by Washington Dental Service (WDS), Delta Dental began by providing dental benefit programs for organized labor unions. WDS underwent a rebranding campaign in 2013 and now goes by the name Delta Dental of Washington. Delta Dental Plans Association (DDPA) was created in 1966 to bring together these local state service organizations and coordinate dental benefit programs for customers with employees in multiple states. A year later, the first multi-state program was sold by WDS to the International Association of Machinists. WDS ceded the administration for enrollees in other states to other Delta Dental member companies and contracted with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for administration in those states without a Delta Dental affiliate organization. Coverage was provided this way until the late 1980s when Delta Dental of California won the bid for the Office of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) program. Delta Dental member companies agreed to share its provider data so the administration of this very large account could be centralized, with Delta Dental of California sharing the administrative income and risk. The OCHAMPUS program led to the creation of the National Provider File (NPF), which was made available for commercial accounts in 1990 via Delta USA ‚Äì providing Delta Dental coverage to organizations with employees and subscribers located in multiple states. Plan assignment If individuals have dental insurance through their employer, the Delta Dental member company in the state of their headquarters usually will handle coverage. Individual Delta Dental insurance is available in several states either through that state's member company or the state or federal health care exchange. Other individual dental insurance options are available through specialty groups such as AARP and military retiree, federal employee and veterans' groups.. Here is a list of dental insurance plans that are available cross most states.

More than 70 people were injured, and 18 died, resulting as one of Ireland's worst rail disasters to ever occur. The accident At 12:45 the 10:00 am Dublin (Heuston) to Cork (Kent) express train entered Buttevant station carrying some 230 bank holiday passengers. The train was diverted off the main line across a 1:8 temporary set of points into a siding. The locomotive remained upright but carriages immediately behind the engine and generator van jack-knifed and were thrown across four sets of rail lines. Two coaches and the dining car were totally demolished by the impact. It resulted in the deaths of 18 people and over 70 people being injured. The accident happened because a set of manual facing points were set to direct the train into the siding. These points were installed about four months previously and had not been connected to the signal cabin. The permanent way maintenance staff were expecting a stationary locomotive at the Up platform to move into the siding and had set the points for the diversion to the siding, without obtaining permission from the signalman. Upon seeing that this had been done, the signalman at Buttevant manually set the signals to the Danger aspect and informed the pointsman to reset the points. The train was travelling too fast to stop in time. The derailment occurred at around . Local doctor Finnbarr Kennedy was on hand at the time of the crash, while waiting to cross the line, and was able to give aid to those injured. =The train= The train consisted of 071 Class locomotive number 075, a generator van and 11 coaches. Six of the coaches consisted of wooden bodies on steel underframes. Four of these were either destroyed or badly damaged in the impact, the two which survived being at the rear of the train. The remainder of the coaches were light-alloy Cravens stock; most of which survived the crash. The generator van, a modified BR Mark 1, was severely damaged. All of the vehicles were coupled using screw shackle couplings. *Locomotive 075 (1976), front plates damaged *Generator/boiler & guards van, No. 3191 (1971), severely damaged *Open 1st class, / timber body No. 1145 (1963), body destroyed *Buffet car / timber body No. 2408 (1953), body destroyed *Self-service car / timber body No. 2412 (1954), body destroyed *Standard carriage / plywood body No. 1491 (1961), badly damaged *Standard craven / light alloy frame No. 1529 (1964), badly damaged *Standard craven / light alloy frame No. 1527 (1964), body damaged *Standard craven / light alloy frame No. 1508 (1964), both ends damaged *Standard craven / light alloy frame No. 1542 (1965), one end damaged *Standard craven / light alloy frame No. 1541 (1965), no damage *Open standard / timber body No. 1365 (1953), no damage *Standard class and brake van / timber body No. 1936 (1959), no damage Aftermath This event, and the subsequent Cherryville junction accident, which killed a further seven people, accounted for 70% of all Irish rail deaths over a 28-year period. CI√â and the Government came under severe public pressure to improve safety and to modernise the fleet. A major review of the national rail safety policy was held and resulted in the rapid elimination of the wooden-bodied coaches that had formed part of the train. The passengers who were most severely injured or killed were seated in coaches with wooden frames. This structure was incapable of surviving a high-speed crash and did not come near to the safety standards provided by modern (post-1950s) metal-body coaches. The expert bodies that reviewed that accident discovered that the old timber-frame carriage bodies mounted on a steel frame were totally inadequate as they were prone to complete collapse (the \\"accordion\\" effect) under the enormous compression forces of a high-speed collision. While the steel underbody remained structurally intact, other carriages could \\"mount\\" the frame, completely compress and destroy the wooden frame body. The more modern steel-framed carriage bodies survived due to their greater structural rigidity. On this basis, the decision to purchase a new fleet of modern intercity coaches based on the British Rail Mark 3 design was quickly made. The Mark 3's longitudinally corrugated roof can survive compression forces of over 300 tonnes. These coaches, an already well proven design, were built by BREL in Derby, England and, under licence, at CI√â's own workshops at Inchicore in Dublin between 1983 and 1989. Commemoration On 8 August 2005, a commemoration marking the 25th anniversary was held at the station. A bronze sculpture in the shape of two crossing train tracks was unveiled alongside a plaque commemorating the names of the victims at the Buttevant Railway station.

Westmeath). The name of the saint's foundation, Lann (in full Lann mic L√∫ach√°in), represents the early Irish word lann meaning \\"(piece of) land, church\\". The word is attested in at least two further placenames for church sites associated with namesakes of the saint: (1) Lann Elo (Lynally), the church of Colm√°n Elo; and (2) Lann Mocholm√≥c, the church of St Mocholm√≥c, a pet form of the name Colm√°n.Mac Math√∫na, \\"Observations on Irish Lann\\", p. 153-4. A Middle Irish Life was written for him in the 12th century, possibly soon after 1122,Carney, \\"Language and Literature to 1169\\", p. 494. which is preserved in a single manuscript kept in the Rennes Library in Brittany.Meyer, Betha Colm√°in, p. v. According to the Annals of Ulster, 22 March (Holy Wednesday) in 1122 was the day when the saint's shrine was discovered in the burial place of Lann.Meyer, Betha Colm√°in, p. vi. Kuno Meyer, who edited the Life, suggests that this event may have prompted the composition of the text shortly after 1122 and also argues that there are linguistic grounds for assigning the text to the 12th century.Meyer, Betha Colm√°in, p. vii. The frequent use of such locational adverbs as sund (\\"here\\") seem to indicate that the Life was also written at Lann. Colm√°n hardly ever appears in sources other than his Lives, two late martyrologies (see below) and a list of Irish homonyms.Meyer, Betha Colm√°in, p. ix. Both prose and verse appear to have been written by the same author and there is no indication that the work draws on earlier versions in either Irish or Latin, unlike many other Irish saints' Lives produced about the time. James Carney regards the Life as \\"so extravagant that it is something approaching a satire\\", akin to Aislinge Meic Con Glinne. Clich√©s of the hagiographic genre, such as demonstrations of the saint's authority through pious behaviour and miracle-working, are exaggerated to absurd effect. There is also a modernised version of this Life, known as Betha Colm√°in Lainne (\\"Life of Colm√°n of Lynn\\"). Colm√°n is not included in the F√©lire √ìengusso, even though his Life pretends to cite the work to this effect, but the Martyrologies of Donegal and Martyrology of Gorman give his feastday at 17 June.Meyer, Betha Colm√°in, pp. xiii-ix.

The company was founded in 1936 by the brothers Josef and Albert Eicher in the Upper Bavaria town of Forstern. The brand name \\"Eicher\\" was last used in Europe in 2009 by the Dutch agricultural machinery dealer Hissink & Zonen and is still in use today in India at Eicher Goodearth which manufactures tractors & commercial vehicles by this name. History In the small village, Forstern near Munich, in Bavaria, Germany, the first Eicher tractor was made, in the 1930s, by Joseph and Albert Eicher. It was the beginning of considerable development of Eicher's Forstern and Dingolfing factories. These pioneers made several tests and carried out a patient work of clarification. The first evolution was marked by the construction of an automatic mower and a three-wheeled tractor. In 1936, Eicher built the first diesel tractor with a 14.7 kW (20 hp) Deutz - diesel engine . The engine was welded to the frame and the rear axle was flanged. The gearbox was attached to the engine and passed the power via a propeller shaft to the rear axle. The mowing drive went from there via an open chain drive. One year later, in 1937, Eicher was represented for the first time at the DLG exhibition in Munich. The block-construction of the Eicher tractors with engines of Deutz and transmission of Prometheus prevailed in the following years. More and more tractors were sold, even tractors could be exported to Austria. Eicher brothers Joseph and Albert Eicher were born and grew up in an agricultural part of Germany. Their personal taste for agriculture favored the development of ideas which led to the manufacturing of machines and modern devices. After the war Eicher ED 16, 1948 After the war, production of pre-war tractors resumed. In 1948, the first post-war development was finally presented, the Eicher ED 16/I. Eicher tractor equipped with a self-welded engine (ED1). The single-cylinder engine produced 11.8 kW (16 hp). The Eicher ED 16/I was the world's first tractor with an air-cooled diesel engine. The air-cooled engines should be a badge of Eicher Tractors later. In the following years, the product range was greatly expanded, with the models Eicher ED 30 (1949), Eicher ED 25 / I (1950) and Eicher ED 28 (1953). The name component ED stood for Eicher Diesel, also the production increased constantly. Eicher acquired on July 1, 1951, the vehicle and mechanical engineering GmbH (Famag) in Dingolfing. This expanded the company in a much greater depth, because with Famag it also got its own foundry . The trailer production of Famag was continued by Eicher for the time being. The brothers Eicher wanted to raise their own production for agricultural machinery. Thus, Eicher developed into a supplier of tractors and agricultural machinery. In 1959, Eicher set up the Eicher Tractor Corporation of India Private Ltd., along with the Goodearth Company of New Delhi, India, and began production in 1960 of Indian-built Eicher tractors. That company sold the tractor business to TAFE, also of India, which still produces Eicher tractors.Eicher MotorsThe Hindu Business Line : TAFE to acquire Eicher's tractor business for Rs 310 cr In the 1960s Eicher started the production of a light truck, which was also produced for Magirus-Deutz at a later date. In 1973, Massey Ferguson purchased Eicher, and many Massey-licensed Eichers were built.Massey Ferguson They later sold their interest, and Dromson now owns the company. They now build specialized tractors for vineyards.

The Continuous Automatic Warning System (CAWS) is a form of cab signalling and train protection system used in Ireland to help train drivers observe and obey lineside signals. CAWS has been in use on Iarnr√≥d √âireann diesel trains since 1984. All NIR trains operating cross-border must also be fitted with CAWS. Coded track circuits, which form the basis of the system (see below), are installed on all Dublin Suburban and Intercity routes to Cork, Limerick, and Athlone and as far as the border on the Belfast line. This system is of American origin, being originally supplied by US&S;, then a division of Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO). Current equipment is supplied by SASIB, a division of Alstom. CAWS ADU on left, Acknowledge & Pre-departure test switches on right CAWS/ATP pick-up coil  Principles of operation  CAWS repeats the aspects shown by the lineside colour light signals on an aspect display unit (ADU) inside the driver's cab. The ADU continuously displays the aspect that was shown by the previous signal until updated about 350 metres before the next signal. The ADU then displays the aspect shown by that signal. A change of ADU display to a less restrictive aspect (e.g., double yellow to green) is termed an upgrade, while a change to a more restrictive aspect (e.g., single yellow to red) is called a downgrade. Any change of ADU display is accompanied by an audible indication. A momentary audible ‚Äòwarble‚Äô sound indicates an upgrade. A downgrade is accompanied by a continuous audible tone and the illumination of the Acknowledge Switch that must be pressed by the driver within seven seconds to prevent an automatic brake application occurring for one minute. This is not recoverable until the time has expired. Acknowledgement by the driver within the first seven seconds immediately silences the tone.  Technical details  The system consists of coded track circuits and on-board equipment. The coded track circuits transmit information about the signal aspect to the on-board equipment via two pick-up coils mounted on the front of the train, one over each rail. The 50 Hz carrier signal is modulated with pulsed square wave codes according to the signal aspect. No code is generated for a red aspect. The system is therefore fail- safe, since loss of code will result in a red indication on the ADU. *Codes: 50, 120 and 180 cpm (cycles per minute). Translated by the CAWS as Yellow, Double Yellow and Green. In electrified DART areas, a different carrier frequency of 83.3 Hz is used to avoid interference from 50 Hz power line frequency. There is also a greater range of codes because they also control the automatic train protection on the DART units. * Codes: 50, 75, 120, 180, 270 and 420 cpm. Translated by the CAWS as Yellow, Green, Yellow, Green, Double Yellow and Green. Translated by the DART ATP as 29 km/h, 30 km/h, 50 km/h, 50 km/h, 75 km/h and 100 km/h speed limits. Diesel drivers have to select the appropriate carrier frequency when moving to or from an electrified area. \\"Carrier 1\\" (50 Hz) is used in non-electrified areas and \\"Carrier 2\\" (83.3 Hz) is used in electrified areas.  Advantages  Because CAWS is a continuous system, an upgrade can occur anywhere between signals. The driver may then accelerate in the knowledge that the signal ahead has changed to a better aspect, even though it may not yet be visible. Similarly, the driver can quickly act upon an unexpected downgrade, which may be the result of the signalman having returned the signal ahead to red in an emergency.  Disadvantages  Since CAWS is dependent on track circuits for its operation, it cannot be applied where axle counters are used for train detection (i.e., \\"mini-CTC\\" areas) without the additional cost. CAWS does not act in the event of a signal being passed at danger if the Red aspect has been acknowledged.

He went to highschool at the Koninklijk Atheneum (E: Royal Atheneum) of Brussels. In 1902 he started at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where he obtained a law degree in 1907. Already as a student he had become interested in the Flemish movement, like his father Julius Hoste Sr. While he was a student, he was a member of Geen Taal, Geen Vrijheid, and together with Nico Gunzburg and Frans Van Cauwelaert, he founded the Algemeen Vlaams Studentenbond. Career After Hoste graduated, he worked shortly for the bar, but soon started working for the newspaper company founded by his father, which published newspapers such as Het Laatste Nieuws, De Vlaamsche Gazet van Brussel and De Zweep (a Flemish weekly). In 1909, he cofounded the Liberale Volksbond of the district Brussels. This organization was founded in reaction to the Franskiljonism of the Liberal Party of Brussels. In 1913, he also participated in the foundation of the Liberaal Vlaams Verbond. During World War I, he lived in the Netherlands. He worked for the newspaper De Vlaamsche Stem until it began German-sponsored activism. In reaction he and Frans Van Cauwelaert founded the newspaper Vrij Belgi√´. Together they also founded the Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond, and worked on the minimumprogramma (E: minimum- program) to establish linguistic uniformity in Flanders (Dutch) and Wallonia (French), Dutch-language usage in Flanders for education, administration, justice and army. After the war this remained the program for the Vlaams- Belgisch Verbond. After the war Hoste took over the management of the publishing company, and Het Laatste Nieuws became the most popular newspaper in Flanders. The success of the newspaper stood in strong contrast to the bad results for the liberals in Brussels in the elections of 1920. Julius Hoste would become president of the Algemene Belgische persbond (1935‚Äì1936), and secretary of the Verbond der Brusselse dagbladbestuurders (1939). In 1935 he entered the political scene, and campaigned against the fascist parties Rex and VNV, and in 1936 became Minister of Education in the second government of Paul Van Zeeland. While he was in office, he founded the Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schone Kunsten and a Dutch and French cultural council (1938). During World War II he stayed in Great Britain, where he became the under-secretary for education in the Belgian government in exile. After the war, he helped reestablish the Liberale Volksbond and the Liberaal Vlaams Verbond. In 1947, he was one of the main authors of the Oxford Manifesto on liberalism. In 1949 he was chosen as liberal senator for Brussels, which he remained until his death in 1954. As a politician he paid attention to the problems of the Belgian communities (Flanders and Wallonia) and world peace during the Cold War.

She was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1903 to Dr. Sterling Foster, an Alabama Presbyterian minister, and Ann Patterson Foster. At 22 she married lawyer Clifford Durr, with whom she had 5 children, one of whom died in infancy. Durr was a close friend of Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt, and was sister-in-law (through her sister's marriage) of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who sat on many crucial civil rights cases. Her circle of friends extended to Alger Hiss. / She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 2006. Life =Background and education= Durr was born in Birmingham, Alabama, where she was raised by black women but was also taught that the Ku Klux Klan were protectors of southern womanhood. One of her grandfathers had owned a plantation and slaves, while the other was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Durr attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts from 1920 to 1923. Durr has explicitly acknowledged Wellesley as the catalyst of her moral transformation from a racist to civil rights activist. She came to question segregation after her experience with her college's dining hall. The dining halls had a rotating tables policy that required students to eat meals with random students regardless of their race. Durr, uncomfortable with this idea, protested this rule, but ended up dealing with it after the head of her house threatened to release her from the university if she didn't embrace the rotating tables policy. Durr was forced to withdraw from Wellesley College due to financial reasons in 1923 and returned home to Birmingham, Alabama. =Marriage= After withdrawing from school in 1923, Virginia Durr returned home to Birmingham, Alabama where she met her future husband Clifford Durr at church. Virginia Durr and Clifford Durr got married in April, 1926, and had five children. Clifford married Virginia Foster Durr in hopes of her being a house wife and great social figure while he became a very successful and influential corporate lawyer. While accepting the role of housewife, Virginia was bothered by the condition many workers and their families were in, which she had noticed while volunteering in social work for churches. Virginia and Clifford Durr gave legal, financial, and moral support to civil rights activists. =Activism= In 1933 Durr moved with her husband to Washington, D.C. after Clifford was appointed legal counsel to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and later Chief Legal Counsel to the Defense Plant Corporation. Eventually it was where they became New Dealers. It was in Washington where Virginia Durr's activism began. She met important people through her husband's New Deal contacts, some of whom changed her conservative views on civil matters. While her husband was working for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Durr joined the Woman's National Democratic Club. In 1938, she was one of the founding members of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW), an interracial group working to reduce segregation and improve living conditions in the South. The group was formed in part as a response to Franklin Roosevelt's proclamation that the South was the leading economic problem in the nation. By 1941, Durr became the vice president of the SCHW's civil rights subcommittee. Working together with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, she lobbied for legislation to abolish the poll tax. She worked jointly with liberal political leaders in order to gain the necessary support needed for legislation, which ultimately resulted in the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Durr later recalled her work with the SCHW as one of the happiest events of her life. Progressive Party candidate Quote from an obituary written by Patricia Sullivan: \\"Mrs. Durr ran for the U.S. Senate from Virginia on the Progressive ticket in 1948. At that time she said, \\"I believe in equal rights for all citizens and I believe the tax money that is now going for war and armaments and the militarization of our country could be better used to give everyone in the United States a secure standard of living.\\" Her opponents were Democrat Absalom Willis Robertson, Republican Robert H. Woods, Independent Howard Carwile and Socialist Clarke T. Robbe. McCarthy era During the McCarthy era, a time where there was intense anti-communist suspicion in the United States where one made accusations of disloyalty without proper evidence, Durr was called to New Orleans to appear before Senator James Eastland's Internal Security Committee, where they investigated suspected Communists. Because the Durrs did not openly condemn communism, anti-Communist activists often targeted them. At the committee, Durr gave her name, assured them that she was not a Communist, and then refused to answer any further questions. =Montgomery= In 1951, Durr returned with her husband to Montgomery, Alabama, where she became acquainted with local civil rights activists like Rosa Parks, Aubrey Williams, E.D. Nixon, and Myles Horton. Durr's activism started once she joined the local Council of Human Relations, Montgomery's only interracial political organization. Durr supported the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) workers by housing and taking care of many volunteers who came to Montgomery to work on voter registration issues. She became the \\"unofficial den mother for young activists,\\" close friend Dorothy M. Zellner says. Both Clifford and Virginia supported the Voting Rights Act, as well as provided legal advice to many blacks facing jail time and lawsuits despite the criticism they received from their white colleagues. They supported the sit-in movement and Freedom Riders. Virginia and her husband offered sleeping space to students coming from the North to protest. Through the couple's work for civil rights, they became close associates of E. D. Nixon, who was the president of the Montgomery NAACP chapter. When Virginia arrived at Montgomery in 1951, she recalled, \\"When I came here, there were two groups of United Church Women, one black and one white.\\" A group of people in her town arranged to have integrated church meetings of black and white women. There was a lot of opposition against the integrated meetings, from the locals as well as from within the church. In her autobiography, Mrs. Durr wrote how the head of the United Church Women in the South (UCWS, an integration group) came to one of the meetings. Opponents of the meeting took the license plate numbers from the cars, and later published the addresses and telephone numbers of the members in an Alabama Ku Klux Klan magazine named \\"Sheet Lightning.\\" The women of the UCWS received harassing phone calls. Some had family members who publicly distanced themselves from their activities, because it was bad for business. As a result, the women became too afraid to continue their meetings and the group broke up. Virginia Durr met Rosa Parks through close friend E.D. Nixon, who worked with Parks during his time working with the NAACP. Durr employed Rosa Parks part-time as a seamstress; she sewed for Virginia and her children, and after a while Virginia considered Parks a close friend. In an exclusive interview with Eyes on the Prize Virginia goes in more depth about their relationship, \\"I went to see her and took her some clothes and took her some of my daughters' and we, they, they, she fixed the clothes for them and I'd often stay and help her. Mrs. Parks was a really lovely woman\\". During the summer of 1955, Myles Horton, a close friend of Durr, asked her to recommend a black person to attend workshops at Highlander Folk School, the purpose of which was to put into effect the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Durr arranged a full scholarship for Rosa Parks to go to the school in Tennessee. It was here where Rosa Parks experienced true equality for the first time in her life. In December 1955, Virginia and Clifford, along with E.D. Nixon, bailed Rosa Parks out of jail after she was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat for a white person. Afterwards, the Durrs, along with the NAACP, aided Rosa Parks in bringing her case to the Supreme Court. Parks' actions sparked what we know of now as the Montgomery bus boycott, which Virginia and Clifford supported by all means. Virginia and her husband also had associations with Martin Luther King Jr., as he and his wife sent the Durrs a postcard from their trip to India in 1959. In March 1965, during the Selma to Montgomery march, the Durrs housed many of the volunteers in their home. In her autobiography, she recalls I spent all my time making coffee and frying bacon and eggs for them. After the boycott, Virginia remained an involved civil rights activist, including working for a variety of organizations such as the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She continued traveling and speaking across the country to colleges, community groups, and civil rights commemorations. =Later life= Clifford Durr died on May 12, 1975 at age 76 and Virginia Durr continued to write and speak about political issues. Mrs. Durr remained active in state and local politics until she was in her nineties. In 1985 she published her autobiography, Outside the Magic Circle. She continued being politically active until a few years before her death. Virginia Foster Durr died in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on February 24, 1999, at the age of 95. Upon hearing of Durr's death, Rosa Parks said Durr's \\"upbringing of privilege did not prohibit her from wanting equality for all people. She was a lady and a scholar, and I will miss her.\\" President Bill Clinton said after her death: \\"Her courage, outspokenness, and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped change this nation forever.\\" Writings Durr published her memoir, Outside the Magic Circle: The Autobiography of Virginia Foster Durr, in 1990, almost a decade before her death. Her memoirs cover the New Deal era, the beginning of the Cold War, her participation in the US presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace, Anti-Communism and McCarthyism, and the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Of note is the account of her acquaintance with Alger Hiss (\\"a charming and attractive fellow\\") and of her version of the breakdown of his marriage with Priscilla Hiss. During the 1930s in Washington, DC, Durr knew the Hisses through Marnie and Henry Abbott, the latter descended from the family of US President John Adams. Some years later, she saw Priscilla Hiss at the wedding of the oldest child of Clark Foreman (founder of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and a Wallace aide during the 1948 elections). Aside from aging past point of recognition, Mrs. Hiss (according to Durr), was \\"terribly bitter\\" about her separation from Alger Hiss: > He [Hiss] became a symbolic hero, particularly to a lot of rich women here > in New York. And they just took him away from me. They surrounded him and > made him a hero and became worshippers, formed a cult almost.

History Inland skimboarding emerged in the mid 1970s and has its roots in Sacramento, California. With homemade skimboards made of plywood, fiberglass and resin, skimmers were sliding on sandbars along the American and Sacramento rivers. Most skimmers back then were just doing headstands, multi-360 spins and 180 shuvits for tricks. The freestyle aspects of inland skimboarding were pioneered in the early 1980s by two Sacramento locals: Launie Porteous and Mark Robinson. Influenced by the emerging skateboard scene, Launie and Mark started adapting their newfound skateboarding skills to skimboarding and the concept of freestyle skimboarding was born. This freestyle adaptation has led to what is now considered the true definition of this sport. With the evolution of the Ollie on a skimboard, it allowed skimmers to transcend into olling over obstacles and opened up the doors for more technical tricks. Riding up the side of a wet river bank and coming back down to simulate a 1/4 pipe was also a new trick. Skimmers also propped up skimboards or wood planks on logs creating a ramp to jump off and do more tricks. In the late 1980s, skimmers advanced to building better rails and jumps and adapting more technical skateboard tricks, but they still used stuff found around their environment like shopping carts, road cones, trash cans, etc. to use for obstacles. The 1990s is where inland skimboarding started to really take hold as a cult sport. Utah was next to have an inland skimboard scene that was actually influenced by Sacramento skimmers that transplanted there. Come the late 1990s, inland skimboarding had steadily grown and had emerged in other US cities and in Canada and Australia. As of today, Canada has the largest number of participants of flatland skimmers; they can't be referred to as inland skimmers because they skim on the coast, but their style of skimboarding is the same as inland skimboarding. Australia also has a large coastal flatland skimboard scene. Flatland and inland skimboarding has also taken hold in various European countries. Differences from other boardsports Flatland skimboarding can be done in almost every region of the world as it only requires a shallow pool of water which can be found in oceans lakes and even flooded fields. Riding rails in flatland skimming is unique in that you can combine snowboarding and skateboarding tricks into one. Without trucks to prevent the rider from spinning creates many variations and combinations of tricks when combining it with the non-binding skateboard tricks such as big- spins and pop shuv-its.  Boards  In the late 1970s and early 80s, companies such as J-Gordon and Victoria manufactured wood skimboards for local California surf and skateboard shops. For the first time inland shops like GoSkate of Sacramento offered skimboards to the local crowd. Shortly thereafter, Surf&Skate; in Sacramento also got involved with offering boards to the emerging skim scene. Before the availability of production-made boards, inland skimmers just made their own wood boards from scratch. The boards back then were a classic tear-drop or tombstone shape. Current designs and constructions have not changed much, but the new shape preference for most inland skimmers is a twin-tip or symmetrical shaped board. The problems encountered with inland skimboarding are the countless rocks, sticks, logs, clam shells, railsliders, run-away boards, etc. These obstacles will eventually destroy any foam constructed board, so wood is still the preferred material of choice for most inland skimmers. Tricks There are an unlimited number of tricks that can be performed while skimboarding. This list only covers a small chunk of the tricks possible. As with other board sports, riders seek out or invent new tricks to progress the sport. =Ollies= *Ollie-A basic jump into the air with the board. To do an ollie, you should lift your back leg up and stomp on the tail of your board which with enough speed/flex will launch the front of your board into the air. *Ollie North-A small variation on the Ollie except that you lift your front foot off the board. *Hippy Jump-The rider rides up to an object a few inches off the ground and jumps over it while the board goes under. *180 ollie- Performing a 180 spin while doing an ollie =Flip Tricks= *Varial Flip - Consists of doing an ollie and then flicking then leading foot in the front right of the board which if done right will generate a flipping and spinning motion that will spin the board in a 180 or 360 depending on how much power was generated from the foot and transferred from the foot and will flip the board also in a side motion that will eventually make and end product of a varial flip. *Kickflip - A kickflip is when the rider after airborne from an ollie then proceeds to use the outer sole of his/her leading foot and also applied with a fast forward motion of the leading foot which should be simultaneously timed with the side flicking motion with the leading foot, the board will flip in a sideways motion thus the rider will stop this motion and stomp the trick. This is arguably one of the hardest tricks in skimboarding. =Spins= * By pushing the sand while moving the rider can spin a number of revolutions. =Shuv- Its= *Shuv-It- By jumping in the air and sweeping the back foot forward and the front foot backwards you can make the board spin 180 degrees. *360 Shuv-It - By placing your feet differently and sweeping your feet harder it is possible to spin the board a full 360 degree spin. *540 Shuv-It - By placing your feet differently and sweeping your feet harder than a 360 shuv it, and jumping higher to get the full 540 degree spin. *Pop Shuv-It - By mixing an Ollie and a Shuv-It you can spin the board in the air. *Big Spin - Mixing a 360 shuv it with 180 varial. *Bigger Spin - Mixing a 540 shuv it with 180 varial. Trick Created by John Minns *Induvit - Consists of doing a large shuv it and then grabbing the board in an indy in either the 90 degree position or 270 position and then proceeding to finish the shuv it by continuing to finish the spin with the arm that grabbed the indy in the beginning of the Induvit. =Body Varials= *Body Varial- If you jump into the air and spin without spinning the board you can perform a Body Varial. You will know you have performed this right if you land with your back forward. *Sex Change By combining a Shuv-It and a Body Varial you can perform a Sex Change. You will know you have done this right if you land with your back foot forward and the back of your board facing forward.  Contests  The first ever inland skimboard event and competition was put on by GoSkate skate shop in 1985 at a skim spot named Rio located along the American River in Sacramento, California. The second inland skimboard event, Skim Fest, occurred in 1997 and was also held in Sacramento along the American River at a popular skim spot known as Paradise Beach. Skim Fest was created by skim pioneers Launie Porteous and Mark Robinson and the event has evolved into an annual competition since 1998 to present. It now holds the title as the longest running inland skim competition in the world.

It is best known for its kosher supervision service, with the COR symbol found on the labels of many commercial and consumer food products. The council serves 1,000 facilities that provide 70,000 products to Canadian consumers. As of September 2014, COR employs 70 full-time and part- time mashgichim who work in local food service and catering venues, plus approximately 30 mashgichim worldwide who supervise COR-certified manufacturing plants. COR supervises food at event venues such as the Rogers Centre, the Air Canada Centre and the Toronto Zoo. In total, COR certifies 53 restaurants in Toronto. COR, in conjunction with Liaison Culinary College, has a college accredited training program for its mashgichim. COR answers questions about Kashruth on phone, email, text and social media. In April 2016, the month before Passover, COR collectively answered 10,000 questions. History COR was founded in November 1952. Before that, it was hard to get legitimately kosher meat in Toronto because there was no regulation. The Canadian Jewish Congress was asked to set up a system to ensure legitimacy of the kosher status of meat in Toronto. In 1954, a Rabbinical Board called the \\"Vaad Hakashruth of the Canadian Jewish Congress of the Central Region\\" was established. It then consisted of 12 Rabbis, having grown to 26 members as of 2017. In June 1956, the name of the Vaad Hakashruth was changed to the Council of Orthodox Rabbis, the source of the abbreviation COR. In the early 1960s, COR successfully appealed to Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker to have Shechita legally approved by the federal government and protected by Canadian law. For many years, Rabbi Gedalia Felder was the chairman of the Vaad Hakashruth, and in 2006, his son Rabbi Yacov Felder became the vice chairman, and eventually the chairman.

The move was aimed at offsetting and undermining the authority of the duke of Gascony Lupo II after the setback suffered by the Franks at the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 and failure to restrain the Basques. That advance clearly displeased the Basques, with these policies sparking a stir on the banks of the Garonne (Count of Toulouse Chorso defeated by Odalric \\"Wasco\\"). The county was appointed to a count called Burgund, who judging by his name was not a Basque. Burgund died in about 801 and was replaced by a certain Liutard, who was alien to the territory. The new appointment and his fresh military arrangements were met with the hostility of important local officials, who staged a rebellion, burning alive supporters of the new count. Ultimately, the rebellion was quelled and the instigators punished. However, in 864 we hear of Arnold, Sancho Sanchez's nephew and a native from the area, holding the title of count of Fezensac. Later in 926, after the death of Garc√≠a II, the F√©zensac was given as an appanage to Garc√≠a's second-eldest son William. It included the cities of Vic and Auch, its capital, as well as the territory of Armagnac.  Carolingian count  * Liutard, count of Fezensac then count of Paris (816).

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. Seventh graders and eighth graders continue to be tested in reading, math and 8th grade science PSSAs. 11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 62% on grade level, (19% below basic).

The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating classes of 2015 and 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students‚Äô Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one- third of the final course grade. =College Remediation= According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 7% of Keystone Central School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. =SAT scores= From January to June 2011, 165 Central Mountain students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 470. The Math average score was 485. The Writing average score was 462. Pennsylvania ranked 40th among states with SAT scores: Verbal - 493, Math - 501, Writing - 479. In the United States, 1.65 million students took the exam in 2011. They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. Sports Central Mountain sports are cross country, volleyball, football, boys and girls basketball, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls tennis, wrestling, track and field, golf, swimming, softball, and baseball. The school participates in PIAA. The school qualifies as an AAAA school but some sports play in AAA competition. They participate in the Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference. =Jerry Sandusky= Central Mountain is the high school that originally brought to light the alleged sexual predation of minors by former Penn State Defensive Coordinator Jerry Sandusky. The school district reported an incident involving Sandusky and Central Mountain student Aaron Fisher (identified in court papers as \\"Victim 1\\") after Fisher and his mother, Dawn Daniels, reported it to authorities in the Spring of 2008. On November 22, 2011, it was reported that Fisher, by then a 17-year-old senior at Central Mountain, was forced to leave the school because of bullying. The other students blamed Victim 1 for Penn State University's firing of football coach Joe Paterno. Fisher and Daniels have claimed that principal Karen Probst and vice principal Steve Turchetta actively tried to persuade them not to report the incident to police. Although the Grand Jury indictment against Sandusky stated that the school called the police immediately upon being notified, Fisher and Daniels have both stated this is false. In an interview with ABC News' 20/20, Fisher and Daniels said that when Probst was notified of Fisher's charges, Probst replied that Sandusky had \\"a heart of gold\\" and would never harm a child, and that Fisher and Daniels needed to \\"go home and think about it\\" rather than report the incident to police. Daniels and Fisher later learned that school officials only reported the incident after they left Probst's office. For unknown reasons, Probst was never fired by the school district and instead was allowed to retire in 2014, despite her role in aiding criminal activity.https://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/06/board_approves_promotion_for_a.html Earlier, in an interview with Huffington Post, Daniels (identified in the story as \\"Mother 1\\") said she first grew suspicious about Sandusky when she learned that Turchetta‚Äîwho also serves as the school's head football coach‚Äîhad given Sandusky nearly unfettered access to her son during school hours without any parental notification or permission. Sandusky had even taken Fisher off campus on several occasions. Daniels also reported (a) that she'd been chastised, and told by, a grandmother in a market \\"that Turchetta brought [Sandusky's banning from the school] up at his weekly football parent meeting, presumably with family members of the football team. According to Daniels, the woman added, 'Coach Turchetta said these charges are never going to stick and he'll walk away'\\"; (b) \\"that her son developed a close bond with a 28-year-old volunteer coach, which Turchetta abruptly ended\\"; and (c) that \\"her son told her that Turchetta was in his face, yelling at him: 'With what you've done already, no 28-year-old man needs to be around you.'\\"Buell, Ryan D., \\"Penn State Scandal: Mother Of Alleged Jerry Sandusky Victim Claims Mistreatment By Son's School\\", Huffington Post, 11/23/11 10:58 am ET update. Later, Fisher and Daniels learned that Turchetta had his own concerns about the relationship between Fisher and Sandusky, but made no further inquiries. The volunteer coach, Thom Hunter, detailed his own relationship with Fisher, his friends and track teammates, and the school which ultimately terminated his position. Neighbors and friends also spoke of gift-giving, car trips and arguments over the relationship between Fisher and Sandusky. Sandusky's attorney spoke of a night alone in a hotel room with Fisher, with \\"a pull-out cot ... paid for\\". A friend spoke at length of a 3-boy trip with Sandusky to a swimming pool, ending with Fisher alone in the car with the coach and \\"Sandusky holding the boy‚Äôs hand\\". Hunter and others spoke of a car accident Fisher suffered, and the process of comeback. Hunter also described the process of his interaction with another coach at the school, of Hunter's then being told to ‚Äústop showing up to practices‚Äù, and of the \\"Bring Tom Back\\" T-shirts thereafter \\"printed ... [by dozens of team members\\"]. \\"'That‚Äôs Jerry ‚Äî he was always a very physical kind of teddy bear, like an overgrown kid,' [Sandusky's attorney Joseph] Amendola said when asked about the friend‚Äôs account [of the swim trip]. 'He would hug kids, he kissed kids, but it wasn‚Äôt sexual.'\\" Amendola also questioned Victim 1's accounts‚Äîsaying that Victim 1 \\"has, over time, exaggerated his claims of being molested\\"‚Äîand spoke of Sandusky's gift-giving habits, in response to the reporting.Schweber, Nate, and Jo Becker, \\"For a Reported Penn State Victim, a Search for Trust\\" (limited no-charge access), The New York Times, November 22, 2011.

It was planned as a loop running to and from Glasgow Central station, but at first only the eastern arm, to Cathcart via Queens Park, was built, opening in 1886. The western arm was opened in 1894 and trains operated round the loop. A frequent passenger train service was operated, and there was also a limited goods and mineral operation. The passenger trains were popular but the company was never very profitable, and tramcar competition hit it hard. A decline set in through the twentieth century until electrification in 1962, which revived the line, which served onward routes to Newton and Neilston as well. The line continues in use today. History =Before suburban railways= The Cathcart District Railway systemThe trunk railways of central Scotland developed from 1850 onwards; the Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) were trunk railways formed with the intention of linking to the English railway network. Other railways south of the River Clyde led to specific locations outside Glasgow. As the city grew, the notion of daily residential passenger travel arose, at first by the middle classes but increasingly by all levels of the community. Suburban railway facilities were limited, and they were inhibited by the inconvenient location of the Glasgow passenger terminals. Bridge Street station was on the south side of the river close to Glasgow Bridge. It served the Paisley lines. South Side station was located further from the city, south of Cumberland Street; it served the Barrhead, Hamilton and Motherwell lines. Buchanan Street station, located on the north-east side of the city at Cowcaddens Street led by a circuitous railway route to the Motherwell and Carlisle line, as well as the Stirling direction. This unsatisfactory situation was resolved by the construction of two central passenger terminal stations: St Enoch station, opened by the G&SWR; in 1876, connecting to the G&SWR; line to Ayr via the Paisley joint line, and to Kilmarnock over the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, opened in 1873. This \\"magnificent terminal\\" was centrally situated in the city, and it gave access to all the G&SWR; south side lines. In 1879 the Caledonian opened its Glasgow Central station, also well situated, and accessible for all the Caledonian's south side routes.Jack Kernahan, The Cathcart Circle, Scottish Railway Preservation Society, Falkirk, 1980, =Cathcart lines proposed= So from 1 August 1879 both large railway companies had commodious new stations serving their south side network. On 15 November 1879 three suburban railways to the Cathcart area were announced in the press; they were all independent, and all assumed a connection to the new terminal stations; they sought running powers for the purpose. They all planned to leave the Barrhead line at Strathbungo, turning south-east. Two proposed a loop, returning to near the starting point; the third was a simple branch line. In fact the G&SWR; rebuffed the approach of one of the contenders, and this was made known to the others, who reconsidered the St Enoch part of their schemes. The most ambitious proposal was the Cathcart District Railway (CDR) and this was favoured by the Caledonian, which offered (in March 1880) to work the line at cost if it were connected only to their lines. As the Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, managed independently, was objecting to the running powers application over their line. Accordingly, the CDR withdrew the proposal for those running powers, and their Parliamentary Bill was unopposed as a result. On 7 September 1880, the Cathcart District Railway Act was passed. The share capital was to be ¬£175,000.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, The route was substantially the present-day Cathcart Circle, leaving the connecting line between Central station and the GB&KJR; line at a proposed Cathcart Junction, near Albert Road (later Albert Drive), running in a loop via Cathcart and returning to a junction near Strathbungo station. =Raising capital and constructing the line= Prior to this the Caledonian Railway had intended to apply for powers to subscribe for shares in the CDR and to work it, but a difference of opinion about the connection to the G&SWR; lines resulted in the Caledonian withdrawing for the time being. In the 1881 session, however the Caledonian relented and the Caledonian Railway (Additional Powers) Act empowered it to subscribe 50% of the share issue, and to manage and work the line. Only now, on 7 December 1881, did the company issue a prospectus inviting public subscription. The Caledonian would work and maintain the line for 45% of gross receipts. Share subscription proceeded satisfactorily, but on 22 November 1882 the company asked the Caledonian to agree to a proposal to construct only the eastern arm of the circle, \\"due to a lack of support in the district\\". This meant building only the section from Cathcart Junction via Queens Park and Mount Florida to Cathcart. The Caledonian agreed to this.From Kernahan, page 16; it seems a remarkably casual way to cancel half the \\"circle\\" route. Only the village of Pollokshaws lay on the proposed route. See also the offer from the Pollok Estate later. Tenders for construction were quickly obtained, and Alex Coghill & Co were awarded the contract in the sum of ¬£76,571 on 10 January 1883; Coghill had no railway construction experience and his tender was substantially cheaper than the others. In fact Coghill was unable to progress the work properly, and left certain buildings alongside railway cutting earthworks in a dangerous situation. A major disagreement over payments arose and on 14 November 1883 Coghill discontinued work on the line. Amid demands for compensation from Coghill, the Company relet the contract to Morrison and Mason in the sum of ¬£76,407. The Company had lost a considerable sum in employing Coghill, and his own company went into liquidation. In April 1885 the Pollok Estates asked if the Company would wish to extend the line to the west of Cathcart, if offered the land at agricultural values. This appears to reinstate the originally intended circle route, and was provisionally accepted by the CDR. Major General Hutchinson inspected the line on 11 February 1886 and approved it for opening as far as Mount Florida subject to some minor detail work. A special train for civic dignitaries ran on 27 February and the public opening was on Monday 1 March 1886, worked by the Caledonian. of railway had been constructed. It was double as far as Crosshill, and single to Mount Florida.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, =First operations and extensions= The line proved remarkably popular; thirty-two trains ran each way six days a week. On 20 May Major General Hutchinson inspected the extension to Cathcart; the whole line was now all double track. Trains started running on 25 May 1886, in the face of reservations from the Caledonian about the passenger facilities at Cathcart station. (The CDR already expected to extend the line and the station was therefore only temporary.) The stations on the line were * Pollokshields East * Queens Park * Crosshill * Mount Florida * Cathcart. Goods and mineral traffic started in August 1887 to Mount Florida and Cathcart; there were no facilities at the other stations. In January 1887 new sets of coaches were provided for the line, consisting of nine four-wheel coaches with gas lighting and steam heating. Football traffic from Hampden Park and also from the Third Lanark ground was a significant traffic from the outset. =Completing the circle= In early 1887 it was decided to complete the circle as originally planned; Caledonian approval was obtained for this and a Bill presented in the 1887 Parliamentary session.The original powers must have been cancelled. The connection at Strathbungo, actually at Muirhouse South Junction, was to the Caledonian line (originally the General Terminus route) and did not touch the GB&KJR; line. The G&SWR; opposed the Bill, but the Royal Assent was obtained on 19 July 1887, capital ¬£145,000. The route did not involve the difficult earthworks of the eastern section of the loop and was to be cheaper to build; cheap land was to be gifted by the Pollok Estate. Although the first section was heavily used, shareholder dividends had been considerably lower than promised and it proved difficult to generate subscriptions; after a time the Caledonian agreed to make the necessary subscription to let the line proceed. In fact the Caledonian exercised gradually increasing minority control of the CDR. An Act of 1889 had empowered it to invest ¬£100,000 in the CDR and to guarantee the interest on the CDR's debenture stock. On 9 October 1890 a contract was awarded for the construction of the line, at ¬£81,095; this was over three years from the Royal Assent for the work. The work did not progress rapidly and a Parliamentary Act was required to extend the permitted time for completion; the line opened on 2 April 1894. There was a new Cathcart through station (actually opened on 19 March 1894); the earlier Cathcart became a goods station. The stations on the new section were: * Cathcart * Langside * Pollokshaws East; a goods depot was provided here; * Shawlands * Maxwell Park; a goods depot was provided south of the station; * Pollokshields West. Pollokshaws East station had the specifier \\"East\\" from the outset. There was already a Pollokshaws station on the joint line, which became Pollokshaws West.Quick says the CDR station was simply Pollokshaws until 1952, but this is not supported by the 1922 and 1938 Bradshaw which use Pollokshaws East.Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1969, Passengers were allowed to travel to and from Glasgow by either arm of the circle; attention was drawn to the anomaly that someone could travel the long way round passing a station where a higher fare to or from Glasgow applied. A special train was run on 31 March 1894 for the press and directors, and the line opened for ordinary traffic on 2 April. Although the line was in heavy use the company was not profitable, and small dividends, or none at all, were the norm. In fact after the first full year of operation of the full circle the line had earnt less than the former half circle in its final year. The anticipated residential development took some time to be started, and street running tramways with cheap fares had developed progressively from 1875. The CDR reduced fares in 1895. =The Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway= The Caledonian Railway carried a heavy mineral traffic from coalfields in South Lanarkshire to Ardrossan Harbour for export. This traffic ran via Langside Junction in south Glasgow, and the heavy and slow trains caused congestion; their onward route was over the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway, so that some of the income from the traffic passed to the rival G&SWR.; The Caledonian would see a considerable advantage if a direct railway could by-pass these areas, and the nominally independent Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway was proposed. In 1888 it opened at the Ardrossan end, and was extended through Neilston to Cathcart, opening for goods on 1 April 1903, and for passengers on 1 May 1903. The final section from Cathcart to Newton, on the Hamilton and Motherwell main line, was opened on 6 January 1904. Passenger trains were run via Mount Florida to Ardrossan and Newton: a 45-minute timing from Glasgow to Ardrossan was allowed for boat trains, but the dominant traffic on the line was mineral trains. The junction at Cathcart was triangular, with the Newton to Mount Florida route being a burrowing junction under the existing Circle line. No passenger service was contemplated on the Neilston to Newton and the Cathcart station was not accessible on that route; it was not possible to run from Langside to either route. =The twentieth century= By the beginning of the twentieth century the residential development hoped for was at last proceeding. Trains on the circle were running at ten-minute intervals, the highest frequency outside London, and despite the electrification of the street tramways, business was booming. There was pressure for more trains, but the limitation was the limited accommodation at Glasgow Central. Fares were lowered and for a time revenues suffered, recovering somewhat from 1907. Incidentally there were no trains on Sunday on the lines (until 1962). At this period, in fact from 1899, electrification of the line was considered. At this early date there was little experience of railway operation by electricity, and it was decided to wait and observe the results of experimentation on railways elsewhere. In 1908 it was definitely decided not to proceed with electrification. The Railways Act 1921 brought about the grouping of the railways of Great Britain. The Caledonian Railway and the Cathcart District Railway were to be incorporated in the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and this took effect from 1 January 1923. (Administrative measures delayed the formal process for several months after the effective date.) The CDR was still receiving 55% of receipts prior to this time. Ordinary shareholders received ¬£51 of ordinary LMS stock with a market value of ¬£57 for every ¬£100 face value of CDR stock. As part of the process the CDR received war compensation of ¬£21,019 from the Government. Tramway competition intensified considerably: Glasgow's tram fares were the cheapest in Britain,Ross, page 156 and the passenger service declined to a 30-minute interval, but carryings improved and a fifteen-minute service was resumed in the years immediately before 1939. However, during World War II the frequency was drastically reduced and an interval service was discontinued. Nationalisation took place in 1948, and on 21 September 1953 a regular hourly service was introduced on the line. Diesel multiple units were introduced from 1958. Electrification had been discussed over many decades but in the late 1950s it became a definite intention. The Cathcart circle was to be resignalled and electrified. The lines to Newton via Kirkhill, and to Neilston, were considered to be integral with the Cathcart circle lines, though steam trains to Ardrossan would continue, running non-stop to Neilston. On 6 March 1961 a new connection was provided at Cathcart enabling trains to run from the Maxwell Park line towards Kirkhill. On 10 December 1961 electric power was switched on, and after trials a public passenger service started on 27 May 1962; Sunday trains ran for the first time. Three car units ran, strengthened to six at peak times; proposals to run nine-coach trains at the busiest times were considered impracticable because of the difficulty of extending the stations' island platforms. The electrification was at 25 kV 50 Hz, but limited overhead clearances required 6.25 kV to be used in the inner area. An electrical control room was provided at Cathcart. The suburban electric trains were equipped with apparatus to switch between line voltages, but when the main line electrification from Crewe to Glasgow was implemented, the Maxwell Park section of the Cathcart circle was designated as a diversionary route. The main line locomotives were not fitted with voltage switching mechanisms, and as the air clearance requirement had been relaxed in the intervening years, the 6.25 kV section was converted to 25 kV from September 1973. Topography = The route = The line diverges from the line between and the Barrhead at Muirhouse North JunctionOriginally named Cathcart Junction; the controlling signalbox was renamed Pollokshields East Junction from 1 July 1903. station is immediately after the junction, and the line turns east passing under the line from Larkfield Junction. Running between retaining walls the line reaches Queens Park station and then Crosshill, turning sharply south still below natural ground level to Mount Florida. Now on an elevated section the line runs to Cathcart North Junction, where the grade-separated divergence to Kings Park leaves. The line now curves sharply west to Cathcart station and Cathcart West Junction where the alternate route from Kings Park converges, and the Neilston line diverges. The line turns north west still on an elevated section and runs through Langside and Pollokshaws West. There is a short climb of 1 in 68 followed by a sharp descent to Shawlands, after which the line crosses the Glasgow to Barrhead line and curves north and then east to Maxwell Park station. The line then enters a cutting to meet Pollokshields West station, rejoining the Barrhead line at Muirhouse Central Junction. The line is 5 miles 19 chains (8.43 km) long. The line falls briefly from Muirhouse North Junction, but climbs at a ruling gradient of 1 in 70 to Mount Florida. The climb moderates but continues to a summit at Cathcart West Junction, and then falls moderately, and then briefly at 1 in 100, to Pollokshaws East. A short climb at 1 in 65 follows, then a longer descent at a ruling gradient of 1 in 67 to Maxwell Park; from there the line continues on very gentle gradients.

System The RAPS system was developed from the Static Line Rounds system.The British Parachute Association It enabled a student to make their first jumps on a ram-air parachute, which offers softer landings and more control. RAPS evolved into the category system, which allows students to use ram-air canopies from their first jump. In the early jumps the parachute is deployed automatically using a static line; after proving basic proficiency the student progresses onto freefall, opening their own parachute by means of a ripcord and spring-loaded pilot chute. The static line method is used in many countries, and although it varies it is, in general, based upon the following structure. *Static line Basic jumps ‚Äì to prove the student's ability to safely exit the aircraft, then fly and land a canopy. The student must be able to go into the stable arched position out of the aircraft before being progressed to dummy ripcord pulls. Dummy ripcord pulls (DPs) ‚Äì the student demonstrates the ability to pull a dummy ripcord while still using the static line to actually deploy the canopy. Generally the student must perform three satisfactory DPs in sequence to be allowed to progress onto freefall. A successful DP is counted as one in which the student not only manages to pull the handle, but also manages to keep an arched position facing in the same direction as when they jumped. *Freefall Early freefall ‚Äì to prove the student can successfully deploy a canopy in freefall (usually 3 to 5 seconds). In most systems the student must perform a 3-second freefall as their first jump, followed by a 5-second freefall. Assuming the student can remain stable enough for a successful deployment of the main parachute they will be progressed onto ten-second delays. 10-second delays ‚Äì the student will jump and wait for 10 seconds before deploying their main parachute. This jump will be the first time a student experiences the full transition from falling vertically to falling \\"belly-to-earth\\". Typically a student must perform two stable delays of 10 seconds before progressing. 15/20-second delays ‚Äì gradually increasing freefall time (10 to 20 seconds) so the student can demonstrate stability for longer periods. It is at this stage that the student will first reach terminal velocity. Usually on the second 15-second delay the student will be given a hand-mounted altimeter for the first time, and will pull either after 15 seconds or earlier if they fall to a determined height. The 20-second delay will almost always be performed with an altimeter, and the student will generally pull based on the reading of the altimeter rather than their own count at this stage. Freefall skills ‚Äì the student will be jumping from the full height that their dropzone allows, usually experiencing up to a minute of freefall. At this point each jump will involve the learning and practicing of a new maneuver, which are listed below. *Turns ‚Äì the student learns to rotate on the spot whilst falling *Tracking ‚Äì the student learns to move through the air horizontally *Dive exit ‚Äì the student learns to dive from the plane into the stable position - after this jump they will no longer exit in the standard student position (sitting or standing on a step) *Unstable exit ‚Äì the student will be made to exit the aircraft unstable and hold this position for a short time, after which they will demonstrate the ability to go stable before deploying their parachute *Backloop ‚Äì the student learns to do what is basically a backflip whilst falling *Track turns ‚Äì the student learns to turn as they track in a specific direction Final qualifying jump ‚Äì The student has to perform one final qualifying jump to demonstrate that they have learnt all the skills from previous jumps. This must begin with a dive exit, contain two 360-degree turns, a backloop and a demonstration of tracking. After this the student is progressed to Category 8, and can attain their A licence once they have completed the Canopy Handling 1 qualification.

He is currently serving a 110-year federal prison sentence, having been convicted in 2012 of charges that his investment company was a massive Ponzi scheme and fraud. Stanford was the chairman of the now defunct Stanford Financial Group of Companies. A fifth- generation Texan who once resided in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, he holds dual citizenship, being a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda and the United States. He contributed millions of dollars to politicians in both Antigua and the United States amongst other countries. In early 2009, Stanford became the subject of several fraud investigations, and on February 17, 2009, was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with fraud and multiple violations of U.S. securities laws for alleged \\"massive ongoing fraud\\" involving $7 billion in certificates of deposits. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raided Stanford's offices in Houston, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Tupelo, Mississippi. On February 27, 2009, the SEC amended its complaint to describe the alleged fraud as a \\"massive Ponzi scheme\\". He \\"voluntarily surrendered\\" to authorities on June 18, 2009. On March 6, 2012, Stanford was convicted on all charges except a single count of wire fraud. He is serving his 110-year sentence at United States Penitentiary, Coleman II in Coleman, Florida. In September 2014, Stanford appealed his conviction; however, the appeals court rejected the appeal in October 2015. Early years Stanford grew up in Mexia, Texas. His father, James Stanford, is former mayor of Mexia and a member of the Board of Directors of Stanford Financial Group. His mother, Sammie (n√©e Conn), is a nurse. After his parents divorced in 1959, Stanford and his brother went to live with their mother. Both of his parents remarried. Stanford graduated from Eastern Hills High School in Fort Worth, Texas.Swartz, Mimi. \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Texas Monthly. May 2009. Volume 37, Issue 5. 211. In 1974, Stanford graduated from Baylor University in Waco, Texas, earning a BA degree in finance. Career Stanford started in business in Waco, Texas, opening a bodybuilding gym that failed. His first success in business came from speculating in real estate in Houston after the Texas oil bubble burst in the early 1980s; his father was his partner in this venture. The men made a fortune in the 1980s, buying up depressed real estate and selling it years later as the market recovered. After his father retired in 1993, Stanford took control of the company, which by then had 500 employees. Stanford moved to the Caribbean in the 1980s, first to Montserrat, then to Antigua. With Stanford Finance, he started Guardian International Bank on the island of Montserrat in 1985; he moved it to Antigua during a British crackdown on Montserrat's offshore-banking industry in the 1980s, renaming it Stanford International Bank, an affiliate of Stanford Financial. Early in 2007, Stanford and Baldwin Spencer, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda and formerly an ally, began verbally feuding in public. In 2009, Antigua's Financial Services Regulatory Commission named a British firm, Vantis Business Recovery Services, the receiver for Stanford International Bank and Stanford Trust Company, the Associated Press reported. Criminal activity =Ponzi scheme and fraud convictions= Federal Detention Center, Houston, where Stanford was held Reports surfaced in early February 2009 that the SEC, the FBI, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a major U.S. private-sector oversight body, were investigating Stanford Financial Group, questioning the consistently higher-than-market returns which Stanford International Bank claimed to make for its depositors.

David Kotz issued a report finding the SEC had failed to uncover the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Stanford. Because of concerns raised by former SEC Chief Investigator David P. Weber of improper conduct by Kotz, Inspector General David C. Williams of the U.S. Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent review. The Williams report found that Kotz \\"appeared to have a conflict of interest\\" because he had a personal relationship with an attorney representing Stanford's victims. Stanford's trial date was set for January 2011. The district judge deemed that Stanford's anti-anxiety drug addiction impaired his judgment and therefore made him unfit to stand trial. Stanford was incarcerated at the Federal Detention Center, Houston.\\"Robert Allen Stanford.\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on August 25, 2010. In February 2011 Stanford issued a counter-claim of $7.2 billion of damages against the FBI and the SEC. In May, prosecutors dropped seven charges against Stanford, leaving 14 charges ongoing. By November 5, 2011, Stanford was being held at the Federal Medical Center at the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner in Butner, North Carolina. His attorneys claimed that Stanford was unfit to stand trial due to amnesia resulting from his sustained injuries. On December 22, 2011, he was found competent to stand trial by U.S. District Judge David Hittner. The trial began on January 24, 2012, at the Houston Federal Courthouse, Judge Hittner presiding. On March 6, after three hours of deliberation, the jury convicted him of masterminding a Ponzi scheme. Prosecutors sought a sentence of 230 years in prison‚Äîthe maximum permitted by law, and 80 years more than the 150-year sentence handed to Bernard Madoff‚Äîcalling him \\"a ruthless predator\\" who \\"lived a life steeped in deceit.\\" Stanford's lawyers pressed for a sentence of 31 to 44 months and a maximum of 10 years; the former sentence, with credit for time served, could have allowed him to walk out of prison without further jail time. According to Peter Henning of The New York Times, judges have been more willing to impose sentences for financial fraudsters that effectively amount to life sentences in recent years. The extent to which such frauds wreck people's lives, Henning wrote, amounts to \\"economic homicide,\\" and such outsized sentences are a way to express society's anger at such conduct.Henning, Peter. Viewing Financial Crimes as \\"Economic Homicide\\". The New York Times, 2012-06-11 On June 14, 2012, Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in prison. Although it is less than half of the maximum sentence sought by prosecutors, it ensures he will likely die in prison. Hittner ordered Stanford to forfeit $5.9 billion, saying that Stanford had orchestrated \\"one of the most egregious frauds ever presented to a trial jury in federal court.\\" At sentencing, Stanford spoke for the first time in the proceedings, denying that he had ever swindled anyone. He blamed his company's failure on \\"Gestapo tactics\\" by government regulators. He is incarcerated at Coleman II USP in Sumterville, Florida; his earliest possible release is April 17, 2105‚Äîwhen he will be 155 years old. On April 26, 2013, federal district judge David Godbey sided with the SEC in its civil suit against Stanford and ordered him to disgorge $6.7 billion ($5.9 billion in illegal profits and $861 million in interest) and pay a $5.9 billion fine. He was permanently banned from the securities industry. Godbey wrote that Stanford had carried out the fraud for over a decade \\"with a high degree of scienter,\\" or knowledge that what he was doing was illegal. Stanford filed a 299-page brief in September 2014 with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on his conviction.Lindenberger, Michael and Waas, Murray.

Description For each year's convention of the Kallah, a treatise of the Mishnah was written forming the subject of explanation and discussion at the convention, according to Ta'anit 10b.See R. Hananeel in Kohut, l.c. iv. 227b cites opinions attributing authorship to either Jehudai Gaon (8th century) or to Eliezer ben Hyrcanus (c.100 CE) with later additions and redaction. The regular Kallah conventions concerned issues related to marriage, chastity, and moral purity. The subject matter was largely taken from the Babylonian Talmud. The importance of the Kallah Convention (referred to under another name) is extolled in the Midrash Tan·∏•uma: \\"God has appointed the two academies (\\"yeshibot\\") for the good of Israel. In them day and night are devoted to the study of the Torah; and to there come the scholars from all places twice a year, in Adar and Elul, and associate with one another in discussions on the Torah.\\"Tanhuma, Noa·∏•, ¬ß 3 The greater the attendance at the convention, the greater was the renown of the academy. Hence Abaye says: \\"The most important part of the Kallah is a crowd.\\"Berachot 6b There was a saying in Babylonia that whoever dreamed of going into a forest would become president of the Kallah (the Kallah being likened to a forest). In the land of Israel there was no Kallah. A. SchwarzJahrbuch f√ºr J√ºdische Gesch. und Litteratur, 1899, ii. 102 claims that this cannot be asserted with certainty, but available historical records show that the Kallah was purely an institution practiced in Babylonia.  Etymology The Mishnaic Hebrew word Yarchei (sing. Yareiach) means \\"months.\\" The word literally is translated as \\"moons.\\" The source for this common Mishnaic term is the fact that Jewish months are based on the lunar cycle. (Note that there is a similar relationship between the English words moon and month.) The word Kallah is always written with ◊î as in ◊õ◊ú◊î, the Hebrew word for \\"bride\\"; but the manner in which this meaning has been connected with a convention of teachersLevy, Neuhebr. W√∂rterbuch, ii. 321 has not been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps the word is merely another form of the Aramaic ◊õ◊ú◊ú◊ê = \\"totality,\\" although this word never occurs in traditional literature as a designation for a collection or assembly of people. It may be connected also with the Aramaic ◊õ◊ú◊ô◊ú◊ê = \\"garland,\\" the assembly of teachers being thought of as a garland adorning the academy (compare \\"Hatzi haGoren\\" and \\"Kerem\\" as designations of the circle which the Sanhedrin formed). In Latin, also, \\"corona\\" means \\"circle,\\" \\"assembly.\\" KohutAruch Completum, iv. 428a has a similar explanation, although he adds an incorrect comparison with a Persian word.

From November 13, 2005 to December 21, 2006 the artists traveled to all 50 states in the United States, the goal being to connect the country through art by experiencing as much in each state as possible in one week. In that time, Abraham painted an impression based on the land or her experiences, or a combination of both. Llamas communicated his experiences by composing music with an acoustic guitar and laptop. As the artists traveled, each state's painting was left in a neighboring state, at an art gallery, art center, or museum, while music was posted on the project's website. This process connected the country, by bringing inspiration from one state and leaving it in the next. By December 21, 2006 the artists had visited and placed a painting in all fifty states. Llamas and Abraham spent about a week in each state, with two weeks being set aside for Texas, California, and Alaska. They traveled in a Honda Element purchased specifically for the project. Llamas modified the vehicle with a storage unit, a refrigerator and a bed. They camped in National Parks, National Forests, and parking lots, spending a day or two in a hotel room each week for painting and creating.  Development  Llamas and Abraham met in Ft. Myers, Florida in early 2002, when Llamas became guitar player for the indie rock band, The Penny Arcade, which at the time, Abraham's sister was lead singer for the band. The two formed a friendship based on their love of music and art and eventually started dating. At this time the couple developed the initial concept for what would become The Nomadic Project. The couple married in November 2003. Originally the project was designed as a personal journey combining their creative passions and desire to travel. The project took a new direction as the couple saw the impact that the 2004 Elections and Iraq War were having on the country. Llamas and Abraham have said it was then they decided to have a painting for each state and to connect the country through art. Llamas and Abraham funded the project solely through the sale of artwork and personal savings. The couple has credited husband and wife artists, Christo and Jeanne-Claude as inspiration for funding their project entirely themselves. In November 2005, three years after they first dreamed of The Nomadic Project, they sold their home and possessions and set out from Ft. Myers, Florida.  Purpose  While traveling cross the country The Nomadic Project was greeted with mixed reactions. Most people applauded the duo's creativity and courage in such an ambitious undertaking, while some dismissed it as two unknown artists involved in an oddball project. For the most part, criticism was minimal and the project received extensive media coverage throughout the country. On December 20, 2006 in a radio interview with WORT in Madison, Wisconsin, the couple spoke of their desire to not only share their experiences with others, but to also inspire people to get out and see the country. They went further to say they felt the country is divided between religious, political, and racial lines, with the Iraq War being the biggest divider. The couple express their hope that through the project, people will be reminded that despite differences, all Americans can agree that they live in a very beautiful and unique country.

It also houses the Accountant in Bankruptcy and the Court of the Lord Lyon and housed the Office of Director of Chancery until its abolition in 1928. Architecture and construction The building is located in West Register Street, Edinburgh behind Robert Adam's 18th century Register House (referred to now as General Register House). The Italianate structure was built by architect Robert Matheson between 1859 and 1863 and was complementary in architectural style to Adam's Neoclassical original. A portico was added to the south elevation to give it the character of a public building; and the style of internal finish was kept simple. New Register House was needed to provide additional storage capacity for Scotland's archives, particularly for the birth, death and marriage records, which were the result of compulsory registration after 1855. The building was first occupied in 1861 and completed in 1863 following the addition of 5 offices to each floor on the north side. The Accountant in Bankruptcy and Lord Lyon's departments were also allocated rooms. It cost, complete with fittings, nearly ¬£35,000 to build. The main feature of the building is the lofty fireproof central repository, the Dome, which consists of five tiers of ironwork shelving and galleries and is surrounded on the outside by staff and search rooms on three floors. The Dome is a large and striking circular chamber, over 27 m (90 ft) high and of interest as a piece of 19th century functional architecture and structural engineering. The of shelving in the Dome contain some half a million volumes. These include some 400,000 statutory registers of all the births, deaths and marriages in Scotland since 1855, still being added to every year. Red birth volumes are on the first tier, the death volumes in funereal black on the second, and the marriage volumes in green on the third. The original marriage schedules, which are signed by the parties immediately after marriage ceremonies in Scotland, are shelved on the top tier of the Dome as are the open Census records from 1841 to 1891. Repository It is today popular among genealogists because, in addition to the Statutory Registers from 1855 onwards, it houses the Old Parish Registers, some of which date back to the 16th century, and the declassified Census records, starting in 1841. The oldest parish volume dates from 1553 and is for the parish of Errol, near Perth. The Canongate parish supplies the earliest parish register for the city of Edinburgh. It dates from 1564, before the Canongate became part of the royal burgh. Among records of ordinary citizens and burgesses it contains the proclamation of banns of marriage of Mary Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley. As well as royals, the building contains records of most famous Scots, for example Robert Burns, David Livingstone and James Watt. Computerised access is available on the Web to indexes of these records; and also to Scanned Images of those before about 1906, thus it is possible to see those actual documents in the comfort of your home anywhere in the world. Potential Closure In January 2015 it was revealed that both New Register House and the neighbouring General Register House had been recommended for closure, upon which time staff and public archive facilities would be located in buildings elsewhere in Edinburgh.

As the 25th episode of the sixth series, it was first broadcast on 6 March 1956 and was among the shows first repeated in the 1970s following the success of The Last Goon Show of All in 1972. Appearing on a program entitled 'Goons Night' on BBC Radio 2, broadcast 29 May 2001, Spike Milligan announced this as his favourite episode of The Goon Show. Title Like many of The Goon Show titles, it was a parody of a contemporary film, The Wages of Fear (1953). Wallace Greenslade initially announces that title as \\"Le Salaire de la peur, meaning The Wages of Fear, or in English...\\". Sellers then announces, as Willium (\\"Mate\\"), \\"The Fear of Wages! Ohhh!\\". Plot The plot is loosely based on the plot of the film, The Wages of Fear; transporting nitroglycerin by trucks. Burma, 6th of March, 1956: Colonel Neddie Seagoon of the 4th Armoured Thunderboxes reads a telegram that Major Bloodnok failed to show him in 1945 because he thought it was a practical joke. The telegram states that World War II ended in August 1945, which comes as a shock because Seagoon and the others have been fighting the Imperial Japanese Army, now confined to a tree, for the last fourteen years. Fortunately, however, General Yakamoto emerges from the tree with a white flag, wishing to borrow more ammunition to keep fighting. The British refuse and so the Japanese surrender, voluntarily giving up their supplies: one thousand cans of nitroglycerine and two thousand cans of sake. The ever-degenerate Bloodnok takes command of the sake, leaving Seagoon to telephone the War Office with news of the victory. Naturally, his first attempt is a \\"wrong number\\". After intoning a noble speech as he dials and listens to the phone ring, he hears the greeting (in the voice of Willium again), \\"Battersea Dogs Home, mate!\\". =Part two= The scene shifts to the Army Pay Corps, where Chief Cashier Hercules Grytpype-Thynne is blatantly stealing money from the army‚Äôs wages and hiding it in a variety of bizarre places, with the help of Moriarty. They receive a telephone call telling them of the miraculous return of the lost regiment. The two thieves are horrified as they have spent all the back pay due to the soldiers. While Moriarty panics and Grytpype ponders the situation, the show goes into its first musical interlude. Back in Burma, Seagoon informs Bloodnok that Whitehall denies that the regiment's soldiers are alive. The only way to get their back pay is to take the Japanese army, in their tree, back to London. Seagoon announces that they should leave the nitroglycerine behind, but just then Grytpype telephones to say that they won't get paid unless all the supplies are accounted for. That means that someone must drive the truck full of nitroglycerin, which leads to a lengthy discussion. Seagoon refuses and Bloodnok has generously volunteered to drive the truck full of the sake, so Eccles (who appears off a record) is ordered to drive the truck, which quickly explodes. However, Eccles reveals he wasn't really driving the truck, and the unfortunate Bluebottle was asleep in the back. After the second musical interlude, we discover that the truck convoy has been driving back to England for five weeks. Bloodnok has been continually drinking the sake all that time, which worries Seagoon as it means they won't get their back pay. In an aside to the audience, General Yakamoto reveals that he switched the sake with the nitroglycerin. Meanwhile, Grytpype (aware that his plot to blow up Seagoon and the others has failed) has called a governmental meeting and informs the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the regiment's combined back pay amounts to millions of pounds, which will ruin the country's annual budget. The decision is made to stop the convoy by getting the Japanese to declare war again. However, the Japanese run out of ammunition again and again are refused to be lent any by the British. However, when Bloodnok tries to cut the tree down, the Japanese reveal they have suddenly got more ammunition (presumably, as Bloodnok suggests, in a Red Cross package from home). Bloodnok and Seagoon jump into the bulletproof driving cab of the truck and continue driving back to England, fighting with the Japanese all the way. At a British government Cabinet meeting, Grytpype finally concedes and admits that they will probably have to pay the regiment their owed wages. The truck pulls up outside and Seagoon and Bloodnok demand their back pay. In turn, Grytpype demands their supplies, willing to take the sake if not the nitroglycerin. Seagoon and the others tip Bloodnok upside down in an attempt to make him vomit up the sake, but as he really drank the nitroglycerin, he explodes. The show ends with Bluebottle asking the announcer, Wallace Greenslade to inform the audience that he was not killed in this episode.

It is set in a science fiction universe in which a human team fights an alien team for control of resources and territory in large and elaborate indoor facilities. It is the sequel to Natural Selection. Gameplay An alien player as a Gorge, the healer class. The unusual alien \\"mouth cam\\" can be seen. A marine commander viewing an alien attack on a friendly base. Like its predecessor, Natural Selection 2 features two opposing teams of players, Kharaa (Aliens) and Frontiersmen (Marines), seeking to destroy the other's respective base. While the two teams have the same essential goals, gameplay for each team varies drastically. Marines largely rely on guns and other pieces of technology to annihilate the alien presence. Aliens, however, rely primarily on melee attacks. Certain alien lifeforms can walk on walls, fly, and even dash forward in the blink of an eye. Players also have a currency system which they use to buy better equipment or evolve into higher lifeforms. The primary feature that differentiates Natural Selection 2 from others in the FPS genre is its strategy component. Both teams may have one player act as a commander, who is given a top-down view of the map and plays the game in a Real-time strategy perspective. The commander can place buildings, research upgrades and has a number of abilities to support their team (dropping health and ammo packs, using certain support units to aid in combat or building, or erecting walls to block enemy movement), at the cost of resources. Buildings in Natural Selection are designed to aid players in their offensive, defensive, stealth and speed capabilities. For a team to achieve victory, they must eliminate all of the opposing team command structures (Hive of the Kharaa, Command Station of the Frontiersmen). The Aliens also have the option of eliminating all infantry portals (Marine spawn structure) and any alive Marines, however because eggs (Alien spawn structure) automatically spawn around hives (unlike Tremulous) Marines cannot do the same.  Development A game engine originally dubbed \\"Evolution\\" was developed specifically for the game. It has since been renamed \\"Spark\\". The game engine utilizes the Lua scripting language for game logic, allowing for easy expansion of the game's mechanics. Physics support is provided by several third-party libraries. The game was officially announced in October 2006. It was to be developed by the Natural Selection creator's newly founded company, Unknown Worlds. Charlie ‚ÄòFlayra‚Äô Cleveland will continue his work on the game and Cory Strader (concept artist from Natural Selection) will also be contributing concept artwork. On December 1, 2006 the first major announcement of a possible feature was announced, named 'Dynamic Infestation'. A video containing an example of Dynamic Infestation was posted on the Unknown Worlds development blog. On August 31, 2007, podcasts by Max McGuire and Charlie Cleveland were released. These audio updates have since been released at irregular intervals. They discuss the development process, funding and focus, and serve as a basis for interviews with other names in the industry. On April 6, 2008, Unknown Worlds established an office.http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/news/2008/4site_problems On July 10, 2008, Unknown Worlds announced their move from the Source Engine to an in- house developed engine dubbed \\"Spark\\". Concept artwork was often shown on the Unknown Worlds development blog. In October 2009, Unknown Worlds confirmed plans to support Mac OS X, Linux platforms and perhaps console. However, in February 2010, Max McGuire announced that OS X, Linux, and Xbox support would not be available at the game's initial launch. It was also revealed that Natural Selection amassed over $200,000 in pre-orders and $500,000 through angel investors.http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25036 On April 9, 2010 a standalone Engine Build became available which included an external map creation utility.http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/news/2010/4/ns2_engine_test_released On May 7, the Engine Build started using Steam as its primary distribution and update source.http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/news/2010/5/friday_update_first_steam_release On 13 July 2010, Unknown Worlds Entertainment announced that a private alpha was to be released through Steam for all Special Edition pre-order customers on 26 July 2010. It will be updated throughout the game development and eventually become the beta release. The full release version of the game will subsequently follow. The alpha test started on July 26, 2010, with those who pre-ordered the game's \\"Special Edition\\" able to activate it via Steam. The game was released on Steam on October 31, 2012. On November 18, 2010, Unknown Worlds Entertainment updated the status from private alpha to closed beta, allowing anyone who had previously pre-ordered either edition of the game, plus the first 10,000 preorders after the announcement was made, into the beta. This was primarily to bring in more capital.http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/news/2010/11/ns2_closed_beta_released_and_how_we_got_here Reception The game sold 144,000 copies in its first week, earning over $1 million. As of February 26, 2013 the game has sold 300,000 copies. The review aggregator Metacritic shows generally favorable reviews, with a Metascore of 80.

Khrapunov has gained notoriety for multiple allegations of fraud, racketeering and laundering of money stolen from the Kazakhstan government. Interpol issued a red notice for the arrest of Khrapunov. Early life and career Khrapunov was born in 1948 in the village of Pryedgornoye, in the district of Glubokoye in the northeast of Kazakhstan. Both his parents were civil servants, his father having been severely injured and become an invalid in the Second World War, young Victor moved to Almaty after finishing the College of Industry and Technology in Oskemen. Once in the capital, he started to work first as a repair mechanic, then as a foreman, and later as senior engineer at the Almaty Thermal Power Station during the day, while studying at the Almaty Institute of Electric Technology in the evening.http://www.viktor-khrapunov.com/en/biography/ Kharpunov secured his future career by joining political echelons through the powerful youth league Komsomol. Thereby he obtained the position of chairman of the Almaty Lenin district Communist Party Committee, and was promoted little later to the post of first deputy chair of the Almaty City Council. From there, he moved on to the position of chairman of the Executive Committee of the City Soviet of People's Deputies, which stood under the direct authority of the all-Union Supreme Soviet. Following the break-up of the USSR and Kazakhstan's subsequent independence, Khrapunov continued his work at the Almaty municipality as first deputy √§kim until 1995. After a term in office as minister of energy and coal, and later minister of energy and natural resources. Khrapunov fell victim, following the economic near-crash of 1995/'96, to the downfall of PM Akezhan Kazhegeldin and most of the latter's cabinet, and in 1997 received compensation with the post of mayor of Almaty. In 2004, Viktor Khrapunov was given the job of √Ñkim of the East Kazakhstan Region, which he was to carry out till 2007 when he was appointed Minister of Emergency Situations in the country's cabinet. That year, he announced his retreat from all public functions and his retirement, for \\"health reasons\\". Accusations, charges, prosecution Khrapunov's name has been connected with a vast number of construction and real estate frauds in and around Almaty‚Äîin particular involving the now defunct KUAT Holding, which left dozens of residential and commercial space projects unfinished and in a virtual state of bankruptcy. Khrapunov's role, according to later statements on behalf of the judicial authorities, is supposed to have consisted of redrawing frontier lines between plots of land belonging to different property right holders. Together with a number of minor-size operators, KUAT has been held responsible for losses inflicted upon proprietors of apartments and commercial space in the order between 2 and 3 billion US dollars. Apart from rendering favours to \\"befriended\\" project developers, Khrapunov had his own business network, controlled by proxy through nominal ownership by his relatives‚Äîstill according to judicial investigators. It included a holding named VILED and various of its subsidiaries and affiliated enterprises, as well as a number of nominally independent firms including KazRealIncome LLP and General Realty LLP, both controlled by a certain A. A. Sadykbayeva, Karasha Plus LLP owned by Leyla Khrapunova's sister G. K. Ilyasova and finally Building Service LLP, controlled by Mrs. Khrapunova herself. Through fake privatisations in the form of swaps consisting of capital injections against property rights of public entities, holding assets such as nursery schools, homes for the elderly, orchards and even some parts of natural reserves on the outskirts of Almaty were appropriated by the firms controlled by the Khrapunovs, while other plots were taken through tender leaks. According to prosecutors' findings sent into the public domain in early 2012, back in 2004, shortly after Viktor Khrapunov had left his job as mayor of Almaty, 46.4 million US dollars and 7.7 million euro were transferred from Leyla Khrapunova's account at the Eurasia Bank, the property of three of Kazakhstan's richest oligarchs Alexander Maskevich, Alizhan Ibrahimov and Patokh Chodiyev, to accounts in unnamed Swiss banks on the name of Elvira Belmadani, alias Elvira Viktorovna Khrapunova, the daughter from the ex-mayor's first marriage. Separately, 5.8 million euro were transferred to accounts in \\"Italian banks\\" belonging to unnamed \\"contractors\\"‚Äîalong with 7.5 million US dollars to \\"other accounts\\"‚Äîequally unspecified. In a parallel transaction, an extra sum of another 7.5 million US dollars was transferred from a company called Elias Import Export LLP for the purchase by Elias of Asia Holding Development LLP. The money transfers uncovered were believed to represent but a small part of the fortune of 300 to 400 million Swiss francs gathered by the Khrapunov family. Khrapunov is on trial in Kazakhstan for \\"laundering, embezzlement, abuse of office, fraud and the creation of an organized crime group.\\" The trial began July 2018. Viktor and Leila Khrapunova purchased and quickly resold three condos in the Trump Soho hotel in 2013, and investigators claim that the couple had used the purchases to launder money stolen from the Kazakh government. The couple also had ties to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Yet one more case under investigation as of spring 2012 concerned the construction of a new terminal at Almaty Airport during Khrapunov's time in office. In the course of 2003, the city of Almaty issued a series of 15 promissory notes with a par value of a million US dollars each. Their collateral consisted of stock in a skeleton enterprise, apparently without any benchmark share price but at the same time the nominal holder of the construction contract for the new terminal of the Almaty international airport. The enterprise's name was Delamore Trade and Investment, a subsidiary of Delamore Group, which in turn controlled Imstalkom‚Äîthe main contractor for the terminal. After the terminal was opened by the end of 2004 after two years of delays, its construction bill turned out to amount of the equivalent of 52 million US dollars rather than the $21 million in the budget. Imstalcom was nominally owned by n enterprise called Kazan To, in turn under control of another company called Phoenix, owned by the Khrapunov family, which later changed its name into Swiss Phoenix Holding SA. Relations with Mukhtar Ablyazov Khrapunov and Mukhtar Ablyazov are alleged to have stolen $4 billion from BTA Bank through a complicated web of embezzlement, corrupt deals and offshore shell companies. The two are co- defendants in a suit that they conspired together to launder $40 million of stolen money by investing in New York City real estate deals. Khrapunov is the father-in-law of Ablyazov's daughter, Madina. The UK High Court issued a judgment on Ilyas Khrapunov with a $500 million fine for allegedly aiding Mukhtar Ablyazov violate a court-ordered asset freeze. Trump connection Khrapunov used shell companies to purchase three Trump Soho apartments totaling $3.1 million with money allegedly stolen from the government of Kazakhstan. Khrapunov's son sought an injunction in the Netherlands to prevent the airing of a documentary called The Dubious Friends of Donald Trump, which explores the connection between the Khrapunovs, Trump and convicted mobster Felix Sater. Khrapunov's family has business ties to the Bayrock Group managed by former Trump advisor Felix Sater, who is a childhood friend of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney. Evade Arrest via Switzerland In August 2008, a chartered Tupolev Tu-154 with on board a load of 18 tonnes of cargo landed at Geneva Airport. The freight's description on the bill of loading read \\"personal belongings\\" of Viktor and Leyla Khrapunov, and reputedly included antiques, jewelry, works of art and other highly valuable items. Added to the money transferred through banking carousels to Switzerland, the Khrapunovs joined their offspring, bringing in a fortune estimated at up to 400 million Swiss francs, or well over a quarter-billion euro, in all‚Äîaccording to the Swiss uppity magazine and local variant to Forbes, Bilan.Iliyas Khrapunov, le millionnaire kazakh qui tisse sa toile a Geneve. On 27 May 2011 the financial police filed two criminal cases against Victor Khrapunov under Part 4, Article 308 of the Criminal Code,\\" a source in the financial police was quoted by Interfax-Kazakhstan in a report published on July 1. \\"Article 308 of the Criminal Code stipulates liability for abuse of power or official authority, while Part 4 specifies fraudulent actions committed to obtain personal gain and cause other persons or organizations to suffer damages,\\" the news report read. On August 19, news reels reported the start-up of a \\"criminal investigation\\" against Khrapunov‚Äîwithout giving any details. In early 2012, Khrapunov's name was added to the Interpol list of wanted persons on request of the government of Kazakhstan. The accused has denied all allegations. On 11 December 2011, Khrapunov in an interview with Le Temps claimed that his resignation from his post in Almaty had to do with his ideas of the city's industrial and commercial development, which appeared to clash with the national government's concept, accusing the latter of \\"oligarchism\\" to the benefit of few elites at the top. He also put Bilans assessment of his and his family's fortune under question, claiming that the property they possessed in and around Geneva was mortgaged‚Äîthereby expressing suspicion that in the magazine's calculation assets had simply been added up to liabilities. He is currently retired and living in Switzerland.

He is the husband of Kath Day-Knight and is a passionate \\"purveyor of fine meats\\". He is portrayed by the comic actor Glenn Robbins. John Michael Higgins portrayed his equivalent (Philip \\"Phil\\" Lesley Knight) in the U.S. version of Kath & Kim,http://epguides.com/KathandKim_US/ and his portrayal was highly criticized. Personality Kel comes across as an honest, respectable, reliable man who finds out he has many talents throughout the episodes. =Physical appearance and personal outlook= Kel takes pride in maintaining himself, although not to Kath's extent. He has greased-down hair and wears pants which are too high for his body, often showing his socks. He exercises often, enjoying power walks and using the home gym. =Hobbies= Kel's main hobby is probably his job. He takes great pride in his butcher shop at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre and also loves to cook. Together with Kath, Kel loves to exercise and do aerobics. He is a Sydney Swans supporter, much to the annoyance of Kath who supports Richmond Tigers. He is somewhat sexually ambiguous and is seen as a metrosexual. During series four he wins Fountion gate retailer of the year and starts coming home early from work and putting up posters around his workshop to show he won, which proves that Kel is extremely passionate about butchering. Kel also didn't show up to work one time after beating up Eric Bana; this is the only time Kel has been seen slacking off work. =Background= Kel is four months younger than Kath. He was very reluctant on the day of their (first invalid) marriage. Kel had previously had four of his past girlfriends/fianc√©es taken away from him, feeling he was unlucky in love and became drunk on the wedding day. He has always been a gourmet butcher. It is also said in the season 1 episode 2 \\"Gay\\" that Kel had previously been in the Navy, where he experienced several instances of being gay with the others in the Navy. It is speculated very lightly that Kel might have possibly acted again on his slight gayness again in the episode before the wedding when Kath wonders how he managed to get the carriage for the wedding from the man who offered himself to Kath for the carriage, in which Kel replies with \\"Oh, I had my ways\\". =Struggles in Kath & Kimderella= During the film Kel is seen having a fear of flying, after a session with former marriage councilor Marion his phobia is cured. Relationships =Kath= Kath Day-Knight Kel's relationship with Kath is very good. They have odd traditions including their work-out time, which includes awkward stretching and power walking. The relationship has had limited difficulties on various occasions where Kath's ex-husband Gary Poole showed up and revealed that the marriage (Kath & Kel) was invalid as he and Kath were, in fact, still married since the 1970s. Also, Kath being older than Kel has created worry for herself. Kel likes to take over Kath's duties sometimes (as seen in \\"Inside Out\\") which annoys her; as she likes to be kept busy and be in charge. =Kim= Kim Craig Kim Craig, Kel's step-daughter and Kath's daughter, is played by Gina Riley. From the beginning of the series, Kim had an instant dislike of Kel, due to the fact that Kath & Kim had each other all of their lives without a father/husband figure in place. Kim and Kel rarely interact, and when they do, the mood goes \\"off\\" and the scene is completely awkward, with one muttering a single word to the other and the other either walking away or trying to give out a grin. Kel is now the focus of Kath's attention which annoys Kim who likes to always be the centre of attention. Kel often tries to express his opinion of Kim to Kath, who does not always agree with what is said. =Sharon= Sharon Strzelecki Sharon Strzelecki, played by Magda Szubanski shows respect towards Kel throughout the entire series. She is first introduced to Kel when Kath introduces the two. They don't usually talk. A mutual respect seems to exist between these characters however, with Kel having referred to Sharon as a \\"good stick\\". =Brett= Brett, Kel's step son-in-law and Kel's best man at the wedding, is played by Peter Rowsthorn. Brett is usually the one who gets informed about Kath and Kel's sexual activities. =Romantic life= Before Kel met Kath, he had a bad history with women. Every person he came close to marrying was always snatched away from him by longtime friend Sandy Freckle, which raised doubt to his mind before his marriage to Kath. Information Kath and Kel kissing Kel‚Äôs hair Kel massaging Kath =Short story lines= Throughout the series, Kel's storylines include taking over as the lady of the house which annoys Kath, the lead up to his marriage to Kath, entering a midlife crisis and having 'mock angina' leading to a 99% fat free obsession. In \\"Da Kath & Kim Code\\", Kel develops a strong dislike of Michael Bubl√©, as Kath has a crush on him and Kel does not approve. Kel is a Sydney Swans supporter in the Australian Football League, something Kath was not aware of until they were married. =Quirks, personality traits and features= Kel wears a combover hairstyle kept in place with Brylcreem and is never without one of his manbags. Kel is often seen wearing a pair of shorts, way above the kneeline, when he is powerwalking. One of Kel's many interests is books and he seems to have a soft spot for the South African author Bryce Courtenay. This is evident in many episodes. For example, in episode 3, failing to make communication with the other butchers at a meat retreat, he pulls out the book The Power of One. In episode 4, he mentions the author twice: Kath is reading the Anti Candida diet book, and Kel mentions Bryce Courtenay, although Courtenay did not actually write the book (far from his genre). Later on, Kel complains of Kath participating in the musical The Hours. Kath recommends he joins the play, which he does, due to them having busy schedules, looking for some time to spend together. Kath explains to Kel that it was a book/movie adaptation to which Kel responds, \\"That was that Bryce Courtenay book, wasn't it?\\". However, Bryce did not write this book either.

Their work is of a satirical nature. Culture Clash was founded on May 5, 1984 at the Galer√≠a de la Raza in San Francisco's Mission District, by the writers Jos√© Antonio Burciaga, Marga G√≥mez, Monica Palacios, Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas, and Herbert Siguenza. The founding date is significant due to the importance of Cinco de Mayo to Mexican-Americans, the shared ethnicity of the majority of collaborators. Montoya and Sig√ºenza had both been involved in the Chicano art scene in the San Francisco Bay Area, Montoya being the son of Chicano poet, artist, and activist Jos√© Montoya, and Sig√ºenza having been involved in the art collective La Raza Graphics, which created works of graphic art to support campaigns of the Chicano Movement. Culture Clash's works range from comedic sketches to full-length plays and screenplays, all of which feature political satire and social satire. The troupe's members have appeared separately and together in several films and received numerous awards, commissions and grants. In 1993 they filmed 30 episodes of a sketch comedy television series, also called Culture Clash. Several episodes were aired on Fox affiliates. In 2006 they premiered two new full-length plays, the comedy Zorro in Hell and \\"SF: The Mexican Bus Mission Tour with CC!\\" Their works have been collected in two volumes, Culture Clash: Life, Death and Revolutionary Comedy and Culture Clash in AmeriCCa: Four Plays. Their papers are housed at the California State University, Northridge (CSUN) Oviatt Library Special Collections and Archives. Touring Around America In the initial tour of Culture Clash, the group incorporated a wide variety of comedy sketches. However, the first tour led the group to start to consider other aspects of Latin culture in America. They began to notice that Latino‚Äôs from different areas of America were experiencing life and culture differently. ‚ÄúThose experiences changed our work,‚Äù Montoya said. ‚ÄúWe went from West Coast Mexican-American and Chicano issues to considering second- and third-generation matters ‚Äî where they live, do they think like their grandparents, and how the different Latino groups behave in different regions of the country. We came away from that 10-year experience with a broadened world view. We understood we were not just a monolithic group, but that the Hispanic makeup is a wide group of people all with different experiences.‚Äù.https://www.delmartimes.net/sddmt-culture-clash- goes-beyond-immigrant-jokes-2010feb11-story.html Gradually this focused the troupe‚Äôs performances to become more serious about performance art and broadening the Latino experience to fit different areas of America. Theatre Activism While the sketch comedy group, Culture Clash, originated as a form of documentary style theatre used to satirize the American experience of Latinos in 1984, the group has recently expanded the scope of their satire. The group traveled through America and reached towards the outside of American society to interview people with different ethnic backgrounds or sexual orientations. Using these interviews, the group went on to use the information as inspiration for new sketch characters and scenarios in their recent anthology of sketches, Culture Clash in AmeriCCa..https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-culture-clash- review-20190109-story.html Culture Clash (still) in America often uses the same sketches that were used 20 years ago with different twists and interpretations of the characters.https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-culture-clash- review-20190109-story.html Although they decided to expand the scope of satire, the group believes that much of the script does not need tweaking due to the same relevance the content of their performances have regarding American society. SAPO The word sapo translates to the word frog in Spanish, and this play was reflected on Aristophanes most prominent comedy, The Frogs, in which he goes in depth on the political views of Athens. It is fairly celebrated for its sharp editorial outlooks on the Athenian governmental issues and society. In SAPO, Dionysus and his cholo slave, Xavier, link up with a band and a coked-out manager to meet with a producer. Due to Culture Clash‚Äôs satirical performances, they were able to dictate issues in a comical manner while presenting them through numerous American chaotic scenes. Instead of the setting being based in Greece, it was changed to California in the mid ‚Äô70s. The plot pertains to a newly discovered Chicano band, El Sapo, which used their inspiration from the Latinx, tropical/funk- infused band, Buyepongo. They explain how they went through the difficulties of traveling in order to find success. Throughout their musical journey, they are on board the ‚Äútour bus to hell,‚Äù https://www.latinheat.com/events/sapo- culture-clash-premiere-of-aristophanes-the-frogs-at-the-getty-villa/ and are face to face with scenarios that are filled with a collective amount of ethos that reflects on the truth and power behind living as if they are in a broken society that lacks any sort of stability. In terms of concentrated points of the play, one specific scene that is based on the hardships of living in an unbalanced society showcases a father and his daughter thinking their camping trip is going to be unproblematic. The father is having doubts while experiencing feelings of fear thinking about his current status of citizenship. He feels as if he has to constantly watch his back to avoid deportation and do anything to protect his daughter. The daughter expresses the opposite reaction while remaining in a calm state because she is confident that her knowledge of the DREAM Act will become useful if they are put in a situation that can potentially be tragic.https://nohoartsdistrict.com/theatres/theatre- reviews/item/5580-culture-clash-premieres-sapo This play did not focus on one specific relevant topic, instead, it was complex, and incorporated various moral topics that can still be seen in today‚Äôs current society. Culture Clash was able to adapt this into a satirical manner while also focusing on the importance of societal issues.

A rigid 2002 Trek 800 Sport mountain bike An elastomer suspension stem Bicycle suspension is the system, or systems, used to suspend the rider and bicycle in order to insulate them from the roughness of the terrain. Bicycle suspension is used primarily on mountain bikes, but is also common on hybrid bicycles. Bicycle suspension can be implemented in a variety of ways, and any combination thereof: *Front suspension *Rear suspension *Suspension seatpost *Suspension saddle *Suspension stem (now uncommon) *Suspension hub Bicycles with only front suspension are referred to as hardtail and bicycles with suspension in both the front and rear are referred to as dual or full suspension bikes. When a bicycle has no suspension it is called rigid. Bicycles with only rear suspension are uncommon although the Brompton folding bicycle is equipped with rear only suspension. Although a stiffer frame is usually preferable, no material is infinitely stiff and therefore any frame will exhibit some flexing. Bicycle designers intentionally make frames in such a way that the frame itself can absorb some vibrations. Besides providing comfort to the rider, suspension systems improve traction and safety by helping to keep one or both wheels in contact with the ground. History 1885 Whippet safety bicycle As early as 1885, the Whippet brand of safety bicycle was notable for its use of springs to suspend the frame. In 1901 the famous author on bicycles Archibald Sharp patented air suspension for bicycles. He was involved with Air Springs Ltd and they developed an air sprung motorcycle in 1909, but they also loaned an air sprung bicycle to the correspondent to show how good the suspension was.The A.S.L. Spring-Frame Motor Bicycle, The Motor Cycle, 7 Jul 1909, p502 It wasn't until 1983 when the first true suspension design came around. A simple rear shock with a single pivot was designed by Brian Skinner and implemented onto a bike called the MCR Descender. This bike had a rigid front fork as the technology to build a fork with a shock wasn't here yet, at least for a mountain bike. oldschoolracing.ch - vintage Mountainbikes race ready! ‚ÄúMCR Descender.‚Äù Accessed 8 May 2020. http://www.oldschoolracing.ch/archiv/descender/. Front suspension first appeared on a bike in 1990 when the founder of Manitou, Doug Bradburry, designed and built the first front suspension fork in his garage. The fork used elastomers and had no dampening effect, just a spring. However, the stiffness was able to be controlled and functioned well except in cold weather.

Front suspension Suspension fork with 100 mm travel on a cross-country mountain bike Cannondale Lefty fork =Telescopic= Front suspension is often implemented using a telescopic (i.e., telescoping) fork. The specifics of the suspension depend on the type of mountain biking the fork is designed for and is generally categorized by the amount of travel. For instance, manufacturers produce different forks for cross-country (XC), downhill (DH), freeride (FR) and enduro (ND) riding which all have different demands for amount of travel, weight, durability, strength, and handling characteristics. Telescopic suspension forks have become increasingly sophisticated. The amount of travel available has typically increased. When suspension forks were introduced, 80‚Äì100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. This amount of travel is now common for cross-country disciplines, whereas downhill forks typically offer 200 mm or more of travel for handling the most extreme terrain. Other advances in design include adjustable travel, allowing riders to adapt the fork's travel to the specific terrain (e.g. less travel for uphill or paved sections, more travel for downhill sections). Many forks feature the ability to lock out the travel. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the fork's travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. The lockout can sometimes be remotely controlled by a lever on the handlebars via a mechanical cable, or even through electronics. As with all shock absorbers it usually consists of two parts: a spring, and a damper. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, compressed air, or even an elastomer. Different spring materials have different spring rates which have a fundamental effect on the characteristics of the fork as a whole. Coil-sprung forks keep an approximately constant (\\"linear\\") spring rate throughout their travel. The spring rate of air-sprung forks however increases with travel, making them progressive. Titanium coils are much lighter but much more expensive. Air-sprung forks are generally lighter still. Air springs work by using the characteristic of compressed air to resist further compression. As the spring itself is provided by the compressed air rather than a coil of metal it is much lighter; this makes their use popular in cross country designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring rate can easily be adjusted by changing the air pressure within the fork. This allows a fork to be effectively tuned to a rider's weight. To achieve this in a coil sprung fork, one would have to swap out different coils with different spring rates. However air pressure naturally controls both spring rate and preload at the same time, requiring air forks to have additional systems to adjust preload separately, adding to its complexity. Another disadvantage of air-sprung forks is the difficulty in achieving a linear spring rate throughout the fork's action. As the fork compresses, the air held inside is compressed. Towards the end of the fork's travel, further compression of the fork requires ever greater force. This results in an increase in spring rate and gives the fork its progressive feel. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring reduces this effect but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited by the need to be contained within the fork. The use of two air chambers within the system has allowed a more linear feel to air suspension, this is achieved by having a 'reserve' chamber that becomes connected to the main chamber when it reaches a certain amount of compression. Once achieved, a valve opens and effectively makes the chamber larger. By linking the two, the force needed to compress the air in the chambers is reduced which reduces the exponential spring rate feel traditionally associated with air systems when approaching the end of the suspension's travel. The amount of preload on coil-sprung forks can generally be adjusted by turning a knob on top of one of the fork legs. Air sprung designs have various ways of dealing with preload. Several systems have been designed to influence preload, such as separately pressurizing different chambers, or systems that automatically set sag after changing the air pressure. A damper is usually implemented by forcing oil to pass through one or more small orifices (also called ports) or shim stacks. On some models the damper may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components are often separated by housing the spring mechanism in one of the fork's legs and the damper in the other. Without a damper unit the system would rebound excessively and would actually give the rider less control than would a rigid fork. To prevent water and dirt from damaging the suspension, gaiters have been used to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move in and out of the cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern dust wipers and seals keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor. =Alternatives= Some manufacturers have tried other variations to the telescopic fork. For example, Cannondale designed a shock absorber build into the steerer tube called HeadShok, and a single-sided fork with just one leg, called Lefty. The stanchions of both systems are not round but have flat faces machined onto them which slide on needle bearings instead of bushings, this prevents the wheel from rotating in relation to the handlebars. Both of these systems claim to offer greater rigidity and better feel, with lighter weight. Others such as Proflex (Girvin), Whyte and BMW, have made suspension forks that employ four- bar linkage systems instead of relying upon telescopic fork legs, much like BMW's Duolever. The Suntour Swing Shock fork is based on a coil cantilevered swing set-up, and suspension is given by a coil spring which is located within the steerer tube and can be accessed from the top, technology which was originally used for suspension on early motorcycles.

Recumbent bicycles with suspension are an exception and often employ rear-only suspension. Mountain bike suspension technology has made great advances since first appearing in the early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's pedal stroke  especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard braking efforts also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider hit the brakes, these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some of their ability to absorb bumps. This happened in situations where the rear suspension was needed most. When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack. Problems with pedal bob and brake jack began to be controlled in the early 1990s. One of the first successful full suspension bikes was designed by Mert Lawwill, a former motorcycle champion. His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the A-arm suspension design from sports car racing, and was the first four-bar linkage in mountain biking. This design reduced the twin problems of unwanted braking and pedaling input to the rear wheel, but the design wasn't flawless. Problems remained with suspension action under acceleration, and the RS-1 couldn't use traditional cantilever brakes since the rear axle, and thus rim, moved in relation to the chainstays and seatstays. A lightweight, powerful disc brake wasn't developed until the mid-1990s, and the disc brake used on the RS-1 was its downfall. Horst Leitner began working on the problem of chain torque and its effect on suspension in the mid-1970s with motorcycles. In 1985 Leitner built a prototype mountain bike incorporating what became known later as the \\"Horst link\\". The Horst Link is a type of four-bar suspension. Leitner formed a mountain bike and research company, AMP research, that began building full-suspension mountain bikes. In 1990, AMP introduced the Horst link as a feature of a \\"fully independent linkage\\" rear suspension for mountain bikes. The AMP B-3 and B-4 XC full- suspension bikes featured optional disc brakes and Horst link rear suspension very similar to the Macpherson strut. Note that the sliding piston in the shock absorber represents the fourth \\"bar\\" in this case. A later model, the B-5, was equipped with a revolutionary four-bar front suspension fork, as well as the Horst link in the rear. It featured up to 125 mm (5 inches) of travel on a bicycle weighing around 10.5 kg (23 pounds). For 10 years AMP Research manufactured their full-suspension bikes in small quantities in Laguna Beach, California, including the manufacture of their own hubs, rear shocks, front suspension forks and cable-actuated-hydraulic disc brakes which they pioneered. =Soft tail= A soft tail (also softail) relies on the flexing of the chainstays of a regular diamond frame to create suspension travel, sometimes incorporating a specific flexing member within the chainstays. A shock absorber (or elastomer) is placed in line with the seat stays to allow the chainstays to move up and down, and for shock absorption. As the suspension moves through its travel the seat stay and shock absorber move out of alignment. This misalignment creates a mechanical lever for suspension forces, causing torque on the joint between chain- and seatstays. This is an inherent structural disadvantage of the soft tail design and severely limits the amount of travel possible, typically around 1 to 2 inches. Soft tails have few moving parts and few pivot points making them simple and requiring little maintenance. Some notable examples include the KHS Team Softail, Trek STP and the Moots YBB. Some bikes (such as the Cannondale Scapel, Yeti ASR Carbon and older Yeti bikes) use a four-bar suspension design where one of the pivots is replaced by a flexing link. =Unified rear triangle= The unified rear triangle or \\"URT\\" for short, keeps the bottom bracket and rear axle directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear axle and bottom bracket, and the front triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom bracket and rear axle gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a single-speed. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and pedals changes, detracting from pedaling efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, he or she is shifting weight from the sprung part of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob. Notable examples of bikes with this type of suspension include the Ibis Szazbo, Klein Mantra, Schwinn S-10, and Trek Y. =Single pivot= Single pivot suspension with 160 mm travel on a 2008 Morewood Mbuzi A single pivot suspension is one in which there is only one pivot point connecting the rear wheel to the main frame of the bike. There may or not be other pivots on the bike, but fulfilling the aforementioned condition makes it a single pivot suspension. A bike might have a four bar suspension and still be single pivot. A bike might have different linkages connecting the rear triangle to the shock and still be a single pivot. Such linkages allow the progressivity of the suspension to be optimized. Single pivot bikes in which the shock is directly connected to the rear triangle, while taking advantage of the simplicity of the design, create a regressive suspension rate, which depending on the type of riding and the force of the impacts, may not be optimal. An advantage of a classic single pivot bike in comparison with a four-bar single or multiple pivot design is the rigidity that it‚Äôs possible to attain with a single structure that‚Äôs connecting the rear wheel to the frame. Some designs try to combine this advantage with a more progressive suspension rate by using the aforementioned extra linkages between the rear triangle and the shock. Another challenge of single pivot bikes is the ‚Äúbrake jack‚Äù, or the influence of braking on the behaviour of the rear suspension. A four bar design allows this problem to be tackled by connecting the rear brake to the seatstays. For other designs, a floating brake mount has been used on some downhill oriented bikes, by means of a pole that connects the rear brake mount to the frame, as a sort of four-bar system for the brake alone. This type of system has mostly gone out of use due to the extra weight it brings, as brake jack is not considered as an especially significant problem. Linkage driven single pivot Linkage driven single pivot rear suspension There are two types of linkage driven single pivots, those in which the extra linkages that connect the main swingarm to the shock play a structural role in the rigidity of the rear section, which are the four bar single pivot designs, and those in which this rigidity is assured by the swingarm alone. In this case the linkages are used to optimize the suspension rate. They may in some cases be designed to add extra rigidity but their role in this regard is not as crucial as in a four bar design. Notable manufacturers well known for their long-time use of this suspension design include KHS, Kona, Jamis, Diamondback Bicycles and older Trek Fuels. Pivot height With single pivot designs, it‚Äôs easy to know how pedaling will influence the rear suspension by looking at the pivot location, and how it stands in relation to the chain line. The chain line corresponds to the part of the chain that is in tension. Its location depends on the size of the chainring that is being used, and on what gear is selected on the cassette. If the pivot is on this line or its continuation, the force that is being actuated on the chain has no influence on the suspension. If the pivot is below this line, pedaling will create anti-squat, which will stiffen and rise the suspension (by what degree depends obviously on the vertical distance between the pivot and the chain line). If the pivot is above this line, the pedaling force will cause the suspension to squat. This is a non-desirable trait, however a squatting design has the advantage of lessening pedal kickback. So in all suspension bikes, there is always a compromise between pedaling efficiency and pedal kickback. Heavier riders will suffer less from pedal kickback, so for them a suspension with more anti-squat won‚Äôt be as compromised as it might be for lighter riders. =Split pivot= The split pivot design is a special case of linkage-driven single pivot in which one of the four-bar's pivot points coincides with the rear axle. This allows for the disc brake caliper to be mounted on the floating linkage (also called coupler) instead of on the swingarm. As a result of this the braking torque now interacts with the suspension via the floating linkage. The linkages can be designed such that this has a positive effect on suspension performance under braking, typically reducing brake jack. Furthermore, the relative rotation between brake disc and brake caliper as the suspension goes through its travel is different from that in single pivot designs. The four linkages in a split pivot design influence how braking torque is transmitted, how the brake caliper moves in relation to the disc and influence the leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock travel. Since these influences may have a different optimum linkage design, the bike's design has to strike a balance. Dave Weagle designed a split pivot which he named \\"Split Pivot\\". Trek Bicycle Corporation also released a version of the split pivot design called \\"Active Braking Pivot\\" (ABP) in early 2007. Cycles Devinci has released a licensed implementation of the \\"Split Pivot\\" design which Dave Weagle managed to patent. =Horst link= Four-bar rear suspension \\"Horst Link\\" suspension is a type of four-bar linkage suspension. It is characterized by having both connecting links pivot on the seat tube, with the lower pivot located above the center of the bottom bracket, and the rear axle being located higher than the pivot connecting floating link and lower connecting link. Specialized has bought several of Leitner's patents which they use for their \\"FSR Suspension\\". Several manufacturer had licensed the design from Specialized. Some European manufacturers, such as Cube and Scott, do use the same suspension design, but couldn't import it to the United States until 2013 due to patent protection. Norco, Canadian bicycle manufacturer also licensed the design from Specialized but further optimized the FSR system, calling their own system Advanced Ride Technology (ART). =Short link four-bar= Although not necessarily sharing any general suspension characteristics, these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the connecting links are so short, the floating link comes in the form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the connecting links of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, connecting links and joint between rear axle and frame. Virtual Pivot Point VPP suspension on a 2013 Santa Cruz Tallboy The \\"Virtual Pivot Point\\" or VPP, is the name given to a four-bar linkage suspension with relatively short links connecting the rear triangle to the frame. It is characterized by having a chainstay lengthening effect and an 'S' shaped axle path. Some variations may have the links rotate in opposite direction as the suspension moves. The instant centre of rotation, as found in all linkage systems, is also called virtual pivot point. The \\"Virtual Pivot Point\\" suspension was developed by Jamie Calon and James Klassen for Outland Bikes in the nineties and the associated patents are now owned by Santa Cruz Bicycles. Living Link A newer suspension design from Spot Bikes couples a \\"Living Link\\" with a conventional VPP or twin link rear suspension system. This design replaces the bottom pivot link with a carbon fiber leaf spring, connecting the front triangle with the rear triangle of the bike. It may seem less durable, but their carbon fiber technology is amongst the best and because it is such a short link, it can endure large forces. This suspension design helps improve pedaling efficiency and rides over bumps like no other, according to forums on PinkBike.

DW- link Diagram of the DW-link suspension, as implemented on an Iron Horse Sunday, showing the location of the instant center at top-out Dave Weagle's \\"DW-link\\" is another four-bar suspension system with two relatively short links, which typically co-rotate. It is characterized by an anti-squat response that varies with suspension travel and is designed to reduce loss of energy resulting from squat during pedaling. It typically has higher anti- squat at the beginning of suspension travel, and less thereafter. The DW-link was originally used by Iron Horse Bicycle Company. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2009 and was acquired by Dorel Industries in July 2009. The DW-link is now licensed to Ibis, Independent Fabrication, Turner Suspension Bicycles, and Pivot Cycles. Giant Maestro Another variation using short, co-rotating, links is employed by Giant Bicycles called \\"Maestro\\". Dave Weagle sued Giant for patent infringement after Giant consulted with Dave Weagle of DW Link. In 2014 the lawsuit was dropped after a lengthy and costly battle. Switch link Yet another variation of short link design is the \\"Switch link\\", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle is connected to the frame using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating a very short lower link whose length is that from the centre of the eccentric to the attached pivot. The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or \\"Switching\\" the lower link's direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a linear bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This linear bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel. Trek Full Floater Trek bicycles' \\"Full Floater\\" is a system where the rear shock is only attached to the rear triangle. The chainstays pivot on the seat-tube, and then extend into the front triangle, and the lower shock bushing attaches to the chainstays. The seatstays are attached to an \\"Evo\\" link, which then attaches to the shock top bushings. This system enables finer tuning of suspension kinematics, as the shock angle relative to the linkages during the travel changes in a more linear fashion. Trek also combines \\"Full Floater\\" with its \\"ABP\\" rear axle, where the rear suspension pivot is the rear axle, which reduces pedal feedback and prevents the braking forces on the wheel from altering the suspension movement. It also provides better traction and control through braking over rough terrain. From 2017 in Trek stopped using the full floater. =Equilink= The \\"Equilink\\" suspension system was developed by Felt Bicycles for their full suspension line. The system employs a \\"Stephenson-style\\" six-bar linkage suspension system. Equilink gets its name from the dog bone shaped bar that ties the upper and lower links together. Early models included a pivot between chain- and seatstay whereas in later, carbon fiber, models the chain- and seatstays are one piece, creating pivoting action by flexing. Felt contends that the system holds its pedaling efficiency in any gear combination. Floating drivetrain Bikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use any type of suspension system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the crank assembly to the frame and rear suspension. Since the linkages are connected to the rear suspension, suspension movement causes the crank assembly to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular rear suspension system so the design can make better use of its advantages. =Independent Drivetrain= The \\"Independent Drivetrain\\" (or \\"IDrive\\") is a four-bar suspension system for bicycle crank assemblies, the rear wheel itself is suspended as single pivot suspension. It was developed by mountain bike suspension designer Jim Busby Jr. and was a direct result of the limitations encountered with the GT LTS (GT Bicycles' \\"Links Tuned Suspension\\") four-bar linkage design used by GT Bicycles from 1993 to 1998. The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear wheel. The bottom bracket is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another. A link between bearing shell and frame then completes the four-bar linkage with the bottom bracket on the floating link and the linkage as a whole actuated by movement of the swingarm. =Monolink= The \\"Monolink\\" made by Maverick Bikes and designed by RockShox founder Paul Turner, is a variant of the Independent Drivetrain suspension, and is a variation of the MacPherson strut. It uses three pivot points and the sliding action of the shock to provide the fourth degree of freedom. This design places the bottom bracket on the link (the Monolink) connecting the frame and rear triangle. Any load on the cranks is partly unsprung since it is also a load on one of the suspension's parts itself, and actively works against the suspension. However, because of this there is less bob during out- of-the-saddle sprints. Once again it is an attempt at maximizing drivetrain efficiency, compromising other areas. Notable bikes using this design are the Maverick ML7, Durance, ML8 and the Klein Palomino. =Pendbox= The \\"Pendbox\\" is found on several of Lapierre's linkage driven single pivot bikes in which the crank assembly is hung from the frame using a 'mini-swingarm'; the Pendbox. A link connects the swingarm and Pendbox such that they form a four- bar linkage. Seat suspension Brooks leather suspension saddle mounted on a suspension seatpost. Suspension may be implemented at the saddle either using a suspension saddle, suspension rails or a suspension seatpost. There are many different kinds of suspension seatposts, not to be confused with dropper seatposts, operating on a variety of different mechanisms. Different designs of suspension cause the seat to move in different paths during the compression. The most basic suspension seat post, a piston style, like the one pictured on the side, uses a sliding post with spring pressure that is often changeable by adjusting a threaded insert in the bottom of the post to adjust the preload on the spring. All piston style seatposts move in a down and forward motion at the slope the seat tube. Because of the need for these parts to slide up and down, all piston style suspension seatposts suffer from at least a slight rotation around the axis of the post resulting in a seat that can wiggle side to side slightly. Piston style seatposts with springs that are not preloaded or other designs with poor tolerances can also have slight up and down wiggle in the seat in the axis of the post. A seat that is not held in place properly can be dangerous if not at least uncomfortable and annoying. Newer and better designs of the piston style seat post have minimized all forms of wiggle and seatposts with actual adjustable pistons built into the post are even available. Parallelogram suspension seat posts use dual linked bars that connect the saddle clamp to the post, and all operate in an arcing motion although some arc backwards and others arc forwards. Differences between the arc directions create posts that are designed for different things, a rear arc would be better for small wheels, moving fast or going uphill while a forward direction would be best with larger wheels on a downhill or at slower speeds. Some seat posts are designed with uneven links creating what is not actually a parallelogram so that the arch approximates a straight line when compressed. Various different designs are implemented to tension the seat post, some use elastomers and others use pistons. The size, shape and position of these elastomers and pistons vary by brand and model as well. Some of the elastomers are adjustable by stacking different combinations of elastomer rings to create a specific profile and ramping up of the suspension. Others have adjustable air pressure or ways to change the profile of the compression. rail suspension is a V shaped loop of seat rail with an extra saddle clamp on the top. The suspension rails are connected to the saddle clamp on the seat post and the extra saddle clamp on the rails is connected to the seat raising the seat up an extra 1.5-3 inches taller. The stiffness of the suspension rails are set by placement of the clamps to the fold in the rails. the motion of the suspension is down and back in an arc with the radius and distance determined by how stiff it is. The effectiveness of saddle, rail, or seatpost suspension depends on the rider placing their weight on the saddle. For this reason, this style of suspension is most popular on more upright styles of bicycle, where the rider spends the majority of time seated. They are especially good for bikes with no other form of suspension such as hybrid bikes, cruisers, road or cyclocross bikes however they can still help on hardtail mountain bikes if used for riding rough or bumpy areas where the suspension in the fork does not create adequate comfort. Suspension hub Suspension may be provided in the hub of a bicycle wheel. One manufacturer offers 12 mm to 24 mm of travel. In mountain biking the term 'suspension hub' was used in the 90s to describe hubs with oversized axle ends and a thicker axles than were customary at the time. These hubs were designed to stiffen up suspension forks, which were still somewhat of a novelty, by rigidly holding the fork legs in position relative to each other once the wheel was fitted, improving steering response in the fork. This term is no longer used as this function is no longer an exceptional requirement for mountain bike front hubs, so all current mountain bike hubs are suspension hubs. Terminology Several terms are commonly used to describe different aspects of a bicycle suspension. =Travel= Travel refers to how much movement a suspension mechanism allows. It usually measures how much the wheel axle moves. =Preload= Preload refers to the force applied to spring component before external loads, such as rider weight, are applied. More preload makes the suspension sag less and less preload makes the suspension sag more. Adjusting preload affects the ride height of the suspension. =Rebound= Rebound refers to the rate at which the suspension component returns to its original configuration after absorbing a shock. The term also generally refers to rebound damping or rebound damping adjustments on shocks, which vary the rebound speed. More rebound damping will cause the shock to return at a slower rate. =Sag= Sag refers to how much a suspension moves under just the static load of the rider. Sag is often used as one parameter when tuning a suspension for a rider. Spring preload is adjusted until the desired amount of sag is measured. =Lockout= Lockout refers to a mechanism to disable a suspension mechanism to render it substantially rigid. This may be desirable during climbing or sprinting to prevent the suspension from absorbing power applied by the rider. Some lockout mechanisms also feature a \\"blow off\\" system that deactivates the lockout when an appropriate force is applied to help prevent damage to the shock and rider injury under high unexpected loads. =Bob and squat= Bob and squat refer to how a suspension, usually rear, responds to rider pedalling. Squat usually refers to how the rear end sinks under acceleration, and bob refers to repeated squat and rebound with each pedal stroke. Both are undesirable characteristics as they rob power from pedalling. Many suspension systems incorporate anti-bob, anti- squat, or \\"platform\\" damping to help eliminate bob. =Pedal feedback= Pedal feedback describes torque applied to the crankset by the chain caused by motion of the rear axle relative to the bottom bracket. Pedal feedback is caused by an increase in the distance between the chainring and rear cog, and it can be felt as a torque on the crankset opposite to forward pedaling. =Compression damping= Compression damping refers to systems that slow the rate of compression in a front fork shock or rear shock. Compression damping is usually accomplished by forcing a hydraulic fluid (such as oil) through a valve when the shock becomes loaded. The amount of damping is determined by the resistance through the valve, a higher amount of damping resulting from greater resistance in the valve. Many shocks have compression damping adjustments which vary the resistance in the valve. Often, lockouts function by allowing no or very little compression. =Unsprung mass= Unsprung mass is the mass of the portions of bicycles that is not supported by the suspension systems. At one extreme are road bicycles with no suspension in the frames, very little in the tires, and none in the saddles. By raising themselves off their saddles, riders may provide suspension with their knees, making their mass be sprung mass, but all of the mass of the bicycles remains unsprung mass. At the other extreme are full suspension mountain bikes. With front and rear suspensions the only parts unsuspended are the wheels and small parts of the front forks and rear chain-stays. Even then, as mountain bikes have large low-pressure tires which allow much more travel than small high- pressure road tires, the wheels are sprung to some extent as well. In general, bikes are so light compared to their riders that travel is a much bigger motivator than unsprung mass in determining where to put the suspension and how much to use. The exception to this is that on recumbent and tandem bicycles where the riders are either unable to lift themselves out of their seat or unable to see in advance when that will be needed, the riders' mass can no longer be expected to be supported by their knees over road irregularities. These bicycles generally have some sort of suspension system to reduce unsprung mass. Mountain bikes Rear suspension of a Trek Fuel 90, a low single pivot with rocker linkage design. Many newer mountain bikes have a full suspension design. In the past, mountain bikes had a rigid frame and a rigid fork. In the early 1990s, mountain bikes started to have front suspension forks. This made riding on rough terrain easier on a rider's arms. The first suspension forks had about 1¬Ω to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Soon after, some frame designers came out with a full suspension frame which gave riders a smoother ride throughout the ride. Newer suspension frame and fork designs have reduced weight, increased amount of suspension travel, and improved feel. Many lock out the rear suspension while the rider is pedaling hard or climbing, in order to improve pedaling efficiency. Most suspension frames and forks have about 4-6 inches (100‚Äì150 mm) of suspension travel. More aggressive suspension frames and forks made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9 inches (200 or 230 mm) of suspension travel. Many riders still prefer to ride a hardtail frame, and almost all mountain bicycle riders use a suspension fork. Notable suspension fork manufacturers include Manitou, √ñhlins, Marzocchi, Fox Racing Shox, RockShox, and (to a lesser extent) X-Fusion, RST, Suntour and Magura. Some bicycle manufacturers (notably Cannondale and Specialized) also make their own suspension systems to fully complement and integrate the bike set-up. Road bikes Although much less common, some road bicycles do incorporate suspensions, particularly the Soft Tail variety mentioned above. One example is Trek Bicycle Corporation's s.p.a (Suspension Performance Advantage) rear suspension, offered on some of their Pilot models, but the system was removed for the 2008 model year. Virtually all bicycles produced by Alex Moulton bicycles also have very effective full suspension, due to the low unsuspended mass of the small wheels and high pressure tires, a characteristic of the unconventional design of these bicycles. A recent design is the cantilevered 'swing shock' on some modern hybrid bikes.http://www.bhbikes.com/web/en/outlet/outlet/easy-motion- trekking/mega.html Recumbent bikes The Optima Stinger recumbent with rear suspension Many recumbent bicycles have at least a rear suspension because the rider is usually unable to lift themselves off the seat while riding. Single pivot is usually adequate when the pedaling thrust is horizontal - that is, forwards rather than downwards. This is usually the case provided the bottom bracket is higher than the seat's base height. Where the bottom bracket is significantly lower than the seat base, there may still be some pedaling- induced bounce. Short-wheelbase recumbents benefit from front suspension more than long wheelbase recumbents because the front wheel (often small diameter which further magnifies the need for suspension) is taking a much larger portion of the loads than in a long wheelbase recumbent. Softride and Zipp The Softride Suspension System was launched at the Interbike 1989 bike show. The original SRS systems consisted of two foam filled fiberglass boxes bonded together with a viscoelastic layer. Originally intended for the use in mountain bikes, Softride produced its first full-fledged mountain bike, the PowerCurve, in 1991. During 1996 Softride released its first aluminum frame road bike, the Classic TT. The Softride Suspension System is used almost exclusively for triathlon racing. Softride ceased bicycle production in 2007 after the design was banned from UCI races. A very closely related suspension design to the Softride is the Zipp 2001, a contemporary competing beam bicycle, where the suspension was in the hinge, rather than in flex of the beam itself.

Officially known as , it is more popularly known as Mount ≈åmine due to its prominence in the ≈åmine mountain range. It is located in Yoshino-Kumano National Park in the Kansai region, Honsh≈´, Japan. The temple ≈åminesanji, located at the top of the mountain, is the headquarters of the Shugend≈ç sect of Japanese Buddhism and the entire mountain is part of a pilgrimage and training ground for the yamabushi. History The monastery at Mount ≈åmine was founded in the 8th century by En no Gy≈çja, as a home for his new religion of Shugend≈ç.Shugendo ‚ÄúYamabushi Monks of the Orient\\" Shugendo literally means \\"the path of training and testing,\\" and is based on the self-actualization of spiritual power in experiential form through challenging and rigorous ritualistic tests of courage and devotion known as shugyo.Shugendo ‚ÄúIntroduction to Shugendo\\" During the Meiji period, in 1872 the imperial government forbade all \\"superstitious practices\\" including belief in folkloric creatures such as Y≈çkai and Y≈´rei, as well as gender bans on sacred mountains such as Mount Fuji and all of the rituals of Mount ≈åmine. During this time the mountain was closed, and any Shugendo practices were carried on in secret. However, in 1945 the Japanese Culture Act repealed these edicts, and the mountain was opened again. Shugend≈ç practicers were quick to reclaim the mountain and restore the traditions. In 1964, Mountaineer/author Ky≈´ya Fukada selected Mount ≈åmine as number 91 of his 100 famous mountains in Japan. Fukuda's three criteria for the selection of 100 celebrated mountains was their physical grandeur, historical and spiritual significance to Japan, and its individuality, meaning it must have a unique shape, phenomenon or event associated with it.JLD Times ‚ÄúMaking a Mountain of mountains\\" In 1980 an area of 36,000 ha in the region of Mount ≈åmine and Mount ≈ådaigahara was designated a UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve. In 2004, it was designated as an UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of the \\"Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range\\".UNESCO World Heritage ‚ÄúSacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range\\" This selection was seen as ending the controversy surrounding the mountain's ban on women climbers, as it was given official approval by UNESCO. Ban on women Sign announcing the prohibition of women climbers Traditionally, women in Japan were not allowed to climb mountains sacred to the Shinto religions. While the origins of the traditions can only be guessed at, originally these areas were banned to unclean people, such as those who had recently had a death in the family or menstruating women, which was believed to be linked to Shinto concepts of impurity, specifically the \\"blood impurity\\" brought on by menstruation and childbirth. Other sacred mountains had different traditions, such as segregating the sexes by season, allowing women to climb at some times and men to climb at others. It is believed that the reason for this ban was to remove thoughts of temptation from the Yamabushi monks who are supposed to practice the strict self-denial of a hermit in isolated mountain. Eventually the bans came to be called Nyonin Kekkai (Â•≥‰∫∫ÁµêÁïå) and toward women only. Mount ≈åmine is the headquarters of the Shugend≈ç religion, an ascetic practice with a long tradition. Because of a decrease of ascetic practitioners in modern Japan, most Shugend≈ç-related mountains are no longer used for mountain retreats and are now tourist attractions. Consequently, these sites removed their gender- restrictions and only Mount ≈åmine remains. Only Mount Sanj≈ç has the ban on women. The Mount Inamura (Á®≤Êùë„É∂Â≤≥) section of Mount ≈åmine is reserved for women and is often called Nyonin ≈åmine (Â•≥‰∫∫Â§ßÂ≥Ø), \\"Women's ≈åmine\\". The holiest temple for the Shugend≈ç religion is found at the Yamagaoka hill section, and a sign at the entrance to the mountain proclaims \\"No Women Admitted,\\" in English and Japanese. (Mount Athos in Greece, an Orthodox Christian site, has a similar ban on women.) Mount ≈åmine's prohibition is voluntary. There have been breaches every year by feminist activists but no trespassing charge has ever been filed. Every time the boundary is breached, the temple and the local community issue a request for people to respect their religion and tradition. The ban has been challenged many times but without success. Supporters note that sexual segregation does not equal sexual discrimination.\\"Some may call it discrimination, but in Japan there is a long tradition that some mountains are only for men and some mountains are only for women,\\" Supporters also state that the ban has an unbroken, 1,300-year tradition.San Francisco Chronicle ‚ÄúPeak's spiritual tradition raises hackles: No women allowed on Japan's holy Mount Omine\\" Mount ≈åmine's designation as a World Heritage site by UNESCO was seen by critics of the ban to have given the gender ban a stamp of approval.Williams University http://www.williams.edu/go/native/omine.htm ‚ÄúA mountain pilgrimage for men only: tradition bars female climbers\\" Tests of courage There are three shugyo on Mount ≈åmine, each said to strengthen the spiritual power of the challenger.

Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Brian Burgess, it was first broadcast on 13 October 1967 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons attempt to destroy London by hi-jacking a transporter carrying an atomic device. Along with \\"Winged Assassin\\", \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\" was postponed during the 2001 repeat run of Captain Scarlet on BBC Two after comparisons were drawn between the plot of the episode and the attacks of September 11, 2001. The clip show series finale, \\"The Inquisition\\", includes a flashback to the episode. Plot The Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) announce that they intend to destroy London. Aided by Captain Black, they use their powers to seize control of a transporter truck carrying an atomic device through the city. The transporter and its driver, Macey, are sealed inside Park View, an underground car park. Macey, who was knocked out during the hi- jacking, wakes up not knowing where he is. Turning on his radio to hear Big Ben strike midnight, he is surprised to hear 13 chimes instead of 12. Although the device requires special keys to activate it, The Mysterons start the device's 12-hour detonation countdown, knock out Macey for a second time and then dump him in a side street. Following the disappearance of the device, Spectrum is put on red alert. Macey is found by Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews) and taken to Cloudbase to describe his ordeal to Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray). More than 2,000 London car parks match Macey's description of Park View. Remembering the driver's claim that Big Ben struck 13, Captain Blue (voiced by Ed Bishop) narrows the field down to two candidates ‚Äì one of them Park View ‚Äì by calculating that Macey's car park cannot be more than a mile from Big Ben. Less than an hour before detonation, Scarlet and Blue fly to London, speed to Park View in a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle and locate the transporter. With too little time left to defuse the device, White orders the officers to take the transporter to a construction site ‚Äì its intended destination ‚Äì and leave the device to detonate in a specially prepared excavation below ground. Scarlet and Blue reach the site with just minutes to spare. With Scarlet driving the transporter, Blue lowers it into the excavation in a lift. Scarlet abandons the transporter and starts back up, but moments later the device explodes, destroying the lift shaft. Scarlet is fatally injured but recovers thanks to his retro-metabolic powers. Some time later, while dining at a restaurant with Scarlet, Destiny Angel (voiced by Liz Morgan) and Melody Angel, Blue explains how he was able to work out the car park's approximate location and why Macey heard Big Ben seemingly strike 13. Macey was hearing two sets of chimes: one over the air, the other on his radio. However, the airborne chimes were delayed by the speed of sound, so the \\"thirteenth\\" chime was actually a repeat of the twelfth that had already sounded on the radio. Following this explanation, Scarlet decides to make 13 his \\"lucky number\\". Production A number of short scenes were scripted but unfilmed. Set immediately after Colonel White orders the red alert, these would have introduced Spectrum captains codenamed Yellow and Purple and shown Captain Scarlet resting in Cloudbase's \\"Room of Sleep\\", which is mentioned but unseen in later episodes. The script describes the Room of Sleep as containing \\"special couches\\" that enable users to condense a full night's sleep into one hour. This episode's scale model work included the construction of entire miniature streets, a task that could not have been accomplished without the larger budget that episodes of Captain Scarlet enjoyed compared to those of earlier Supermarionation series. It was on the street sets that the transporter hi-jacking was filmed ‚Äì a scene that Derek Meddings, the series' special effects director, remembered for its atmosphere. The sets were redecorated and reorganised several times to make it appear that Macey's transporter covers more ground. The transporter model, which re- appears in \\"Expo 2068\\", was designed by Meddings' assistant, Mike Trim. The incidental music for \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\" was recorded on 16 April 1967 in a four-hour session held at series composer Barry Gray's private studio, where it was performed by an ensemble of 14 instrumentalists. It includes a light jazz track, \\"Until Midnight\\", which can be heard playing on the transporter radio in the scene leading up to Big Ben's midnight chimes. Music for the following episode, \\"Manhunt\\", was recorded on the same day. Broadcast and reception When BBC Two started to repeat Captain Scarlet in September 2001, \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\" was originally due to be broadcast as the third episode to match the order of production. However, it was postponed due to similarities between the plot, which focuses on a missing atomic device, and the September 11 attacks that had occurred earlier that month. This coincided with distributor Carlton briefly taking down the Captain Scarlet pages on its website. The episode was ultimately broadcast several weeks after its intended transmission date. =Critical response= Mike Fillis of Cult Times magazine considers \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\" a highlight of Captain Scarlet, describing the episode's scale model work as \\"superb\\". Gary Russell, writing for What DVD magazine, cites the episode's first act (which he describes as being devoted to Macey's \\"paranoia\\") as an example of Captain Scarlets relative maturity for a children's TV series, as well as the series' \\"sense of darkness ... and real drama\\". Chris Bentley, author of Captain Scarlet: The Vault, describes the scenes of Captains Scarlet and Blue rushing to the construction site as \\"fostering unbearable tension\\", which he argues is heightened by Spectrum's defeat in the previous episode, \\"Winged Assassin\\". Media historian Nicholas J.

Biography Chambers was born in South Shields and educated at the town's Union British School, where the pupils were particularly encouraged to draw ships and other nautical subjects. He joined the Tyne Pilot Service on leaving school, but left before reaching manhood and decided to become an artist. Chambers enrolled at the Government School of Design in Newcastle upon Tyne and later went to study in Paris in the ateliers of Professors Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre, before settling at North Shields as a professional artist. He first began exhibiting in 1877, showing several examples at the South Shields Fine Art & Industrial Exhibition. He followed this by showing his Partonhall and Harbour at the Central Exchange Art Gallery, Newcastle, in 1878 and was subsequently an exhibitor at the Arts Association Exhibition in Newcastle in 1879, 1881 and 1882 and the Gateshead Fine Art & Industrial Exhibition in 1883. In the following year he began an association with the exhibitions of the Newcastle Bewick Club which lasted just over a decade. In 1886, he sent his first of three works to the exhibitions of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, showing The Deserted Mill. Chambers mainly exhibited on Tyneside for the remainder of his career, including exhibitions at the art clubs of South Shields, where he was a vice-president, Tynemouth, and from their inception in 1905, the Artists of the Northern Counties exhibitions at the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne. Most of his work was executed in watercolour and predominantly featured nautical and landscape subjects. His most important work, however, was in oil and pictured the loss of , which was accidentally sunk off Tripoli during manoeuvres in 1893. He had painted the vessel as it looked leaving the Tyne following its completion at Sir William Armstrong's Elswick Yard in 1888 and after its loss, spent a year preparing a √ó canvas which proved so successful an interpretation of the scene that an offer of ¬£2000 was made for the picture, but was refused.North Mail and Newcastle Chronicle, 12 July 1928. It was exhibited all over Tyneside, and was also engraved. Chambers maintained a succession of studios at North Shields where, at times, he directed painting classes,Shields Daily News, 2 January 1909 and at which he held exhibitions of his work, and occasionally those of fellow artists. It was also shown before being sold in large quantities by Bainbridge & Co., a North Shields auctioneers,Shields Daily News, 21 October 1911 & 6 February 1915 and featured in several local loan exhibitions. Despite frequent favourable comments on his work, he remained a quiet, diffident artist who died at his home and studio at Borough Road, North Shields, without really extending his reputation beyond his native Northumbria, although he is reputed to have lectured on art in other parts of the country,North Mail and Newcastle Chronicle, 12 July 1928 was a regular visitor to the Berwickshire coastline,Shields Daily News, 21 October 1892 & 8 November 1899 and had also worked in Holland. Although much of this reputation rested on his nautical and landscape paintings he also etched subjects for sale locally and was an occasional illustrator of Tyneside publications. Among his less typical works were a number of portraits in watercolour, among these one of Henry Hetherington Emmerson now in the possession of the Laing Art Gallery. He also produced a sketch of Emmerson for the menu card of the annual Bewick Club dinner in 1889.

Population: History It was first mentioned in 1505 as a fortified settlement. From 1562 it was known as Slobodskoy posad (). It has had town status since 1780. Slobodskoy is one of the oldest towns in Kirov Oblast. It appeared after joining Vyatka region to Moscow in 1489. For the first time Slobodskoy was mentioned in the charter of Ivan the Terrible in 1505. This year is considered to be the year of its foundation. In Slobodskoy there was the Kremlin castle, from the south it was defended by a large moat, from the east by the bank of the Vyatka and from the north by a large ravine. In the Kremlin there were three churches made of wood. At that time there were 154 houses and nearly 600 people lived here. The site of the town was chosen rather well. It was a place of forests and endless grasslands. In the forests there were a lot of animals and the rivers were full of fish. Russians arrived in the 12th century. They were peasants who built the villages on the bank of the Vyatka River. They were from Novgorod, Ustyug, and Suzdal. The peasants were occupied with agriculture; they fed cattle, grew vegetables, and liked fishing and hunting. Slobodskoy province was connected with other provinces by highways and a river system. Natives used those routes for trading. The highway on which Slobodskoy was situated was also the way of the Russian sovereign from Moscow to far Siberia. That highway played a great role in the fate of the town. It had become an outpost and a trade center in the north of Vyatka by the beginning of the 17th century. In the 17th century Slobodskoy became an uyezd seat with its own government. Since 1784, Slobodskoy began to be built according to the plan of Catherine the Great. In the 18th and 19th centuries, brick houses in the spirit of provincial classic appeared in the main street.

The SPP is an agreement between the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico to work towards a more integrated North American economy and security region. Composed of 30 corporate representatives from some of North America's largest companies, the North American Competitiveness Council has been mandated to set priorities for the SPP and to act as a stable driver of the integration process through changes in government in all three countries. The NACC became inactive in 2009. History While the North American Competitiveness Council was officially born on March 31, 2006 at the second annual summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, its seeds were planted three months earlier. On January 10 and 11, 2006, United Parcel Service, the Council of the Americas and the North American Business Committee convened a \\"public/private sector dialogue on the SPP\\" in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The meeting was attended by 50 government officials and business leaders from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, including officials from the Canadian Privy Council Office, the Mexican Presidency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and corporate reps from ExxonMobil, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Tyco, and FedEx. According to an account of the meeting from the Council of the Americas, attendees discussed \\"marrying policy issues with business priorities\\", and that \\"one critical factor in the success of the SPP will be the active engagement of the North American business community.\\" Private sector supporters of the SPP \\"need to build a genuine constituency for North American integration if it is to move forward successfully\\", says the Council of the Americas report. \\"Leadership from governments that recognizes the importance of business issues to the overall social welfare empowers the private sector to engage substantively and pragmatically on trade and security issues without undue deference to political sensibilities.\\" On March 15, 2006, North American business leaders met in Washington, D.C. with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, Canadian Deputy Minister of Industry Suzanne Hurtubise and Dr. Alberto Ortega from the Mexican Presidency. According to a backgrounder from the Council of the Americas, the government officials were interested in \\"the views of the North American business community on priorities for the SPP, as well as recommendations from business leaders on how the SPP can help their companies be more competitive in the global market, how SPP can reduce the cost of doing business, and any specific recommendations to cut red tape or eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade in North America.\\" Business leaders were also asked about the possible creation and institutionalization of a North American Competitiveness Council. There was unanimous support. Just over two weeks later, U.S. President George W. Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and former Mexican President Vicente Fox met in Canc√∫n for the second annual summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership. The leaders were each accompanied by five private sector representatives who pledged their commitment to the SPP process and helped set the agenda for the North American Competitiveness Council (NACC). They decided that the Council would be composed of 30 CEOs, ten from each country, who would meet annually with senior government officials to advise them on corporate priorities for the SPP. The NACC was officially launched on June 15, 2006 at a joint press conference held by Carlos Gutierrez, Mexican Economy Minister Sergio Garc√≠a de Alba and Canadian Industry Minister Maxime Bernier. According to a Council of the Americas report, the purpose of institutionalizing the North American business community's involvement in the SPP process was, \\"so that the work will continue through changes in administrations.\\" The NACC will make sure that, \\"governments look to the private sector to tell them what needs to be done.\\" According to a Canadian press release, the NACC \\"has a mandate to provide governments with recommendations on broad issues such as border facilitation and regulation, as well as the competitiveness of key sectors including automotive, transportation, manufacturing and services.\\" The NACC met again in Washington, D.C., on August 15, 2006. The meeting was chaired by Ron Covais, President of the Americas for Lockheed Martin, and was co-hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Council of the Americas ‚Äì both U.S. NACC co-secretariats. The U.S. business leaders outlined their key priorities as \\"standards and regulatory cooperation, border security and infrastructure, supply chain management, energy integration, innovation, and external dimensions\\", but the NACC as a whole eventually agreed on three overall priorities: border crossing facilitation (to be handled by the Canadian NACC members), regulatory convergence (to be handled by the U.S. NACC) and energy integration, which the Mexican NACC members would handle. The North American Competitiveness Council met with SPP ministers for the first time on February 23, 2007 in Ottawa. At that meeting, the business council released a preliminary report containing over 50 recommendations for continental integration, including a North American resource pact and intensified regulatory convergence between all three countries. On July 26, 2007, the conservative, non-partisan U.S. government watchdog Judicial Watch notified Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez that it was seeking access to the meetings and records of the North American Competitiveness Council (NACC) under the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) ‚Äì the federal open meetings law (5 U.S.C App. 2 ¬ß3(2)). \\"Specifically\\", said Judicial Watch in a press release, the group, \\"seeks to attend and/or participate in meetings of the NACC and its U.S. component subcommittees.\\" The NACC met again with SPP ministers and NAFTA leaders on August 21, 2007, at the Chateau Montebello hotel in Quebec, Canada. It was the only non-governmental organization with full access to the meeting, the third Security and Prosperity Partnership Leaders Summit since March 2005. The group of CEOs released another report praising the Canadian, Mexican and U.S. governments for moving quickly on NACC recommendations for a North American Regulatory Cooperation Framework and Intellectual Property Action Plan. The NACC report explained that the group is prepared, \\"to move beyond our initial report\\" and would be \\"pleased to engage on other strategic issues affecting the competitiveness and security of the North American economies.\\" The SPP has scheduled a meeting in New Orleans on April 21‚Äì22, 2008, where the three government leaders will meet with corporate leaders from each of the three nations to discuss \\"harmonization\\" of policies, in order to integrate environmental, energy, labor, and other standards for the benefit of these large corporations and for the purported benefit of mutual security. Media coverage Until the February 23, 2007 NACC/SPP meeting in Ottawa, there had been very little media coverage of the North American Competitiveness Council, its mandate or its meetings. In fact, the only mainstream North American source to write about the NACC has been Canada's Maclean's magazine, which ran a story on September 13 by Luiza Savage called \\"Meet NAFTA 2.0.\\" Savage described the NACC as a \\"cherry-picked group of executives who were whisked to Canc√∫n in March by the leaders of Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, and asked to come up with a plan for taking North American integration beyond NAFTA.\\" She quoted Annette Verschuren, president of Home Depot Canada, who called the Canc√∫n meeting \\"an intimate discussion\\" and \\"a lot of fun [because] there were no reporters, just a freewheeling discussion on the things that drive you crazy.\\" Ron Covais of Lockheed Martin told Savage that, \\"The guidance from the ministers was, 'tell us what we need to do and we'll make it happen,'\\" and that rather than going through the legislative process in any country, the Security and Prosperity Partnership must be implemented in incremental changes by executive agencies, bureaucrats and regulators. \\"We've decided not to recommend any things that would require legislative changes\\", Covais tells Savage, \\"because we won't get anywhere.\\" NACC Members U.S. Representatives:http://coa.counciloftheamericas.org/files/editor/image/grp_10.pdf * Campbell Soup Company * Chevron Corporation * Ford Motor Company * FedEx Corporation * General Electric Company * General Motors Corp. * Kansas City Southern * Lockheed Martin Corporation * Merck & Co., Inc. * Mittal Steel USA * New York Life Insurance Company * The Procter & Gamble Company (joined in 2007) * UPS * Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. * Whirlpool Corporation (note: Herman Cain was incorrectly noted as being a member of the NACC/SPP in representing the Whirlpool Corporation.

Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland by the organisation Sunshine Press, claimed in 2015 to have released online 10 million documents in its first 10 years. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder and director. Since September 2018, Kristinn Hrafnsson has served as its editor-in-chief. The group has released a number of prominent document caches. Early releases included documentation of equipment expenditures and holdings in the Afghanistan war, a report informing a corruption investigation in Kenya, and a manual for operations at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In April 2010, WikiLeaks released the Collateral Murder footage from the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike in which Iraqi journalists were among those killed. Other releases in 2010 included the Afghan War Diary and the \\"Iraq War Logs\\". The latter allowed the mapping of 109,032 deaths in \\"significant\\" attacks by insurgents in Iraq that had been reported to Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq, including about 15,000 that had not been previously published. In 2010, WikiLeaks also released the US State Department diplomatic \\"cables\\", classified cables that had been sent to the US State Department. In April 2011, WikiLeaks began publishing 779 secret files relating to prisoners detained in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2012, WikiLeaks released the \\"Syria Files,\\" over two million emails sent by Syrian politicians, corporations and government ministries. In 2015, WikiLeaks published Saudi Arabian diplomatic cables, documents detailing spying by the U.S. National Security Agency on successive French Presidents, and the intellectual property chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a controversial international trade agreement which had been negotiated in secret. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, WikiLeaks released emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. These releases caused significant harm to the Clinton campaign, and have been attributed as a potential contributing factor to her loss. The U.S. intelligence community expressed \\"high confidence\\" that the leaked emails had been hacked by Russia and supplied to WikiLeaks, while WikiLeaks denied their source was Russia or any other state. During the campaign, WikiLeaks promoted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.How Julian Assange turned WikiLeaks into Trump's best friend, Max Chafkin & Vernon Silver, 10 October 2016 (Bloomberg website) In 2016, WikiLeaks released nearly 300,000 emails it described as coming from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, later found to be taken from public mailing archives, and over 50,000 emails from the Turkish minister of energy. In 2017, WikiLeaks published internal CIA documents describing tools used by the agency to hack devices including mobile phones and routers. WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for its alleged absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia, and for criticising the Panama Papers' expos√© of businesses and individuals with offshore bank accounts. The organisation has additionally been criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit card numbers and details of suicide attempts. History =Staff, name and founding= Julian Assange was one of the early members of the WikiLeaks staff and is credited as the website's founder. The wikileaks.org domain name was registered on 4 October 2006. The website was established and published its first document in December 2006. WikiLeaks is usually represented in public by Julian Assange, who has been described as \\"the heart and soul of this organisation, its founder, philosopher, spokesperson, original coder, organiser, financier, and all the rest\\". Daniel Domscheit-Berg, Sarah Harrison, Kristinn Hrafnsson and Joseph Farrell are other publicly known associates of Assange who have been involved in the project. Harrison is also a member of Sunshine Press Productions along with Assange and Ingi Ragnar Ingason.. News.techeye.net (15 November 2010). Retrieved 22 November 2011.. Icenews.is (13 November 2010). Retrieved 22 November 2011. WikiLeaks is not and never has been affiliated with the well- known website Wikipedia or Wikipedia's parent organization, the Wikimedia Foundation. Gavin MacFadyen was acknowledged by Assange as a ‚Ä≥beloved director of WikiLeaks‚Ä≥ shortly after his death in 2016. WikiLeaks was originally established with a \\"wiki\\" communal publication method, which was terminated by May 2010. Original volunteers and founders were once described as a mixture of Asian dissidents, journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States, Taiwan, Europe, Australia, and South Africa. , the website had more than 1,200 registered volunteers.. Mother Jones (6 April 2010). Retrieved 22 November 2011. Despite some popular confusion, related to the fact both sites use the \\"wiki\\" name and website design template, WikiLeaks and Wikipedia are not affiliated. Wikia, a for-profit corporation affiliated loosely with the Wikimedia Foundation, purchased several WikiLeaks-related domain names as a \\"protective brand measure\\" in 2007. On 26 September 2018, it was announced that Julian Assange had appointed Kristinn Hrafnsson as editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks while the organisation's statement said Assange was remaining as its publisher. His access to the internet was cut off by Ecuador in March 2018 after he tweeted that Britain was about to conduct a propaganda war against Russia relating to the Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Ecuador said he had broken a commitment \\"not to issue messages that might interfere with other states\\" and Assange said he was \\"exercising his right to free speech\\". =Purpose= According to the WikiLeaks website, its goal is \\"to bring important news and information to the public ... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth.\\" Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that journalists and whistleblowers are not prosecuted for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online \\"drop box\\" is described by the WikiLeaks website as \\"an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to [WikiLeaks] journalists\\". In a 2013 resolution, the International Federation of Journalists, a trade union of journalists, called WikiLeaks a \\"new breed of media organisation\\" that \\"offers important opportunities for media organisations\\".

David Folkenflik: PublicAffairs, 2011). Bill Keller of The New York Times considers WikiLeaks to be a \\"complicated source\\" rather than a journalistic partner. Prominent First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams writes that WikiLeaks is not a journalistic group, but instead \\"an organization of political activists; ... a source for journalists; and ... a conduit of leaked information to the press and the public\\".Floyd Abrams, Friend of the Court: On the Front Lines with the First Amendment (Yale University Press, 2013), p. 390. In support of his opinion, he said Assange's statements that WikiLeaks reads only a small fraction of information before deciding to publish it, Abrams writes: \\"No journalistic entity I have ever heard of‚Äînone‚Äîsimply releases to the world an elephantine amount of material it has not read.\\" Administration According to a January 2010 interview, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated. WikiLeaks does not have any official headquarters. In November 2010 the WikiLeaks- endorsed news and activism site WikiLeaks Central was initiated and was administrated by editor Heather Marsh who oversaw over 70 writers and volunteers. She resigned on 8 March 2012. WikiLeaks describes itself as \\"an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking\\". The website is available on multiple servers, different domain names and has an official Darkweb version (available on the Tor Network) as a result of a number of denial-of-service attacks and its elimination from different Domain Name System (DNS) providers. Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was hosted by PRQ, a company based in Sweden providing \\"highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services\\". PRQ was reported by The Register website to have \\"almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs\\". Later, WikiLeaks was hosted mainly by the Swedish Internet service provider Bahnhof in the Pionen facility, a former nuclear bunker in Sweden. Other servers are spread around the world with the main server located in Sweden. Julian Assange has said that the servers are located in Sweden and the other countries \\"specifically because those nations offer legal protection to the disclosures made on the site\\". He talks about the Swedish constitution, which gives the information‚Äìproviders total legal protection. It is forbidden, according to Swedish law, for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper. These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authority to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place a burden of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, \\"WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information.\\" Such arrangements have been called \\"bulletproof hosting\\". After the site became the target of a denial-of-service attack on its old servers, WikiLeaks moved its website to Amazon's servers. Later, however, the website was \\"ousted\\" from the Amazon servers. In a public statement, Amazon said that WikiLeaks was not following its terms of service. The company further explained: \\"There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of service state that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content ... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.' It's clear that WikiLeaks doesn't own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content.\\" WikiLeaks was then moved to servers at OVH, a private web-hosting service in France. After criticism from the French government, the company sought two court rulings about the legality of hosting WikiLeaks. While the court in Lille immediately refused to force OVH to deactivate the WikiLeaks website, the court in Paris stated it would need more time to examine the complex technical issue. WikiLeaks used EveryDNS, but was dropped by the company after distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against WikiLeaks hurt the quality of service for its other customers. Supporters of WikiLeaks waged verbal and DDoS attacks on EveryDNS. Because of a typographical error in blogs mistaking EveryDNS for competitor EasyDNS, the sizeable Internet backlash hit EasyDNS. Despite that, EasyDNS (upon request of a customer who was setting up new WikiLeaks hosting) began providing WikiLeaks with DNS service on \\"two 'battle hardened' servers\\" to protect the quality of service for its other customers. WikiLeaks restructured its process for contributions after its first document leaks did not gain much attention. Assange stated this was part of an attempt to take the voluntary effort typically seen in \\"Wiki\\" projects, and \\"redirect it to ... material that has real potential for change\\". Some sympathisers were unhappy when WikiLeaks ended a community-based wiki format in favour of a more centralised organisation. The \\"about\\" page originally read: However, WikiLeaks established an editorial policy that accepted only documents that were \\"of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest\\" (and excluded \\"material that is already publicly available\\"). This coincided with early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote \\"automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records\\". The original FAQ is no longer in effect, and no one can post or edit documents on WikiLeaks. Now, submissions to WikiLeaks are reviewed by anonymous WikiLeaks reviewers, and documents that do not meet the editorial criteria are rejected. By 2008, the revised FAQ stated: \\"Anybody can post comments to it. [ ... ] Users can publicly discuss documents and analyse their credibility and veracity.\\" After the 2010 reorganisation, posting new comments on leaks was no longer possible. Legal status The legal status of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange considers WikiLeaks a protection intermediary. Rather than leaking directly to the press, and fearing exposure and retribution, whistleblowers can leak to WikiLeaks, which then leaks to the press for them. Its servers are located throughout Europe and are accessible from any uncensored web connection. The group located its headquarters in Sweden because it has one of the world's strongest laws to protect confidential source-journalist relationships. WikiLeaks has stated it does not solicit any information. However, Assange used his speech during the Hack in the Box conference in Malaysia to ask the crowd of hackers and security researchers to help find documents on its \\"Most Wanted Leaks of 2009\\" list. =Potential criminal prosecution= The US Justice Department began a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange soon after the leak of diplomatic cables in 2010 began. Former Attorney General Eric Holder affirmed the investigation was \\"not saber-rattling\\", but was \\"an active, ongoing criminal investigation\\". The Washington Post reported that the department was considering charges under the Espionage Act of 1917, an action which former prosecutors characterised as \\"difficult\\" because of First Amendment protections for the press. Several Supreme Court cases (e.g. Bartnicki v. Vopper) have established previously that the American Constitution protects the re-publication of illegally gained information provided the publishers did not themselves violate any laws in acquiring it. Federal prosecutors have also considered prosecuting Assange for trafficking in stolen government property, but since the diplomatic cables are intellectual rather than physical property, that method is also difficult. Any prosecution of Assange would require extraditing him to the United States, a procedure made more complicated and potentially delayed by any preceding extradition to Sweden. One of Assange's lawyers, however, says they are fighting extradition to Sweden because it might result in his extradition to the United States. Assange's attorney, Mark Stephens, has \\"heard from Swedish authorities there has been a secretly empanelled grand jury in Alexandria, [Virginia]\\" meeting to consider criminal charges for the WikiLeaks case. In December 2010, the Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that \\"I absolutely condemn the placement of this information on the WikiLeaks website - it's a grossly irresponsible thing to do and an illegal thing to do\\". After criticism and a revolt within her party, she said she was referring to \\"the original theft of the material by a junior U.S. serviceman rather than any action by Mr Assange\\". Spencer Zifcak, president of Liberty Victoria, an Australian civil liberties group, notes that without a charge or a trial completed, it is inappropriate to state that WikiLeaks is guilty of illegal activities. The Australian Federal Police later said that the release of the cables by WikiLeaks breached no Australian laws. On threats by various governments towards Julian Assange, legal expert Ben Saul argues that Assange is the target of a global smear campaign to demonise him as a criminal or as a terrorist, without any legal basis.: statement by Dr Ben Saul, director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Sydney. The US Center for Constitutional Rights has issued a statement emphasising its alarm at the \\"multiple examples of legal overreach and irregularities\\" in his arrest. =Use of leaked documents in court= On 8 February 2018, the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a document leaked through WikiLeaks \\"could be admitted into evidence\\". The cable had been excluded from use in an earlier part of the case before the Administrative Court. The Supreme Court hearing was considered an important test of the Vienna Convention in relation to Wikileaks documents. The appeal that led to this ruling centred on a US government cable provided by Chelsea Manning and published by WikiLeaks. The Chagos islanders argued that the document showed the UK's motive for setting up a marine park on their territory was to put an end to the islanders' resettlement claims, a motive which the islanders considered improper. However, the Supreme Court also ruled that the admission into evidence of the Wikileaks document would not have made a difference to the Administrative Court‚Äôs decision that there was no improper motive behind the marine park proposal. Financing WikiLeaks is a self-described not-for-profit organisation, funded largely by volunteers, and is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional bank transfers and online payment systems. According to Assange, WikiLeaks' lawyers often work pro bono. Assange has said that in some cases legal aid has been donated by media organisations such as the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, and the National Newspaper Publishers Association. Assange said in 2010 that WikiLeaks' only revenue consists of donations, but it has considered other options including auctioning early access to documents. During September 2011, WikiLeaks began auctioning items on eBay to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive. On 24 December 2009, WikiLeaks announced that it was experiencing a shortage of funds and suspended all access to its website except for a form to submit new material. Material that was previously published was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial mirror websites at the time. WikiLeaks stated on its website that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were paid. WikiLeaks saw this as a kind of work stoppage \\"to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue\\". While the organisation initially planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010, it was not until 3 February 2010 that WikiLeaks announced that its minimum fundraising goal had been achieved. The Wau Holland Foundation helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation stated that WikiLeaks was not receiving any money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth. An article in TechEye stated: However, in December 2010, the Wau Holland Foundation stated that 4 permanent employees, including Julian Assange, had begun to receive salaries. In 2010, Assange said the organisation was registered as a library in Australia, a foundation in France, and a newspaper in Sweden, and that it also used two United States-based non- profit 501c3 organisations for funding purposes. On 22 January 2010, the Internet payment intermediary PayPal suspended WikiLeaks' donation account and froze its assets. WikiLeaks said that this had happened before, and was done for \\"no obvious reason\\". The account was restored on 25 January 2010. On 18 May 2010, WikiLeaks announced that its website and archive were operational again. In June 2010, WikiLeaks was a finalist for a grant of more than half a million dollars from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, but did not make the final approval. WikiLeaks commented via Twitter: \\"WikiLeaks was highest rated project in the Knight challenge, strongly recommended to the board but gets no funding. Go figure.\\" WikiLeaks said that the Knight foundation announced the award to \\"'12 Grantees who will impact future of news' ‚Äì but not WikiLeaks\\" and questioned whether Knight foundation was \\"really looking for impact\\". A spokesman of the Knight Foundation disputed parts of WikiLeaks' statement, saying \\"WikiLeaks was not recommended by Knight staff to the board.\\" However, he declined to say whether WikiLeaks was the project rated highest by the Knight advisory panel, which consists of non- staffers, among them journalist Jennifer 8. Lee, who has done PR work for WikiLeaks with the press and on social networking websites. During 2010, WikiLeaks received ‚Ç¨635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less ‚Ç¨30,000 in PayPal fees, and ‚Ç¨695,925.46 in bank transfers. ‚Ç¨500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments on 4 December. ‚Ç¨298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April. The Wau Holland Foundation, one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than ‚Ç¨900,000 in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, of which ‚Ç¨370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice-president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through PayPal as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account. He also noted that every new WikiLeaks publication brought \\"a wave of support\\", and that donations were strongest in the weeks after WikiLeaks started publishing leaked diplomatic cables. The Icelandic judiciary decided that Valitor (a company related to Visa and MasterCard) was violating the law when it prevented donation to the site by credit card. A justice ruled that the donations will be allowed to return to the site after 14 days or they would be fined in the amount of US$6,000 a day. Leaks =2006‚Äì08= WikiLeaks posted its first document in December 2006, a decision to assassinate Somali government officials signed by rebel leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys. In August 2007, the UK newspaper The Guardian published a story about corruption by the family of the former Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi based on information provided via WikiLeaks. In November 2007, a March 2003 copy of Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta detailing the protocol of the US Army at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp was released. The document revealed that some prisoners were off-limits to the International Committee of the Red Cross, something that the US military had in the past denied repeatedly. In February 2008, WikiLeaks released allegations of illegal activities at the Cayman Islands branch of the Swiss Bank Julius Baer, which resulted in the bank suing WikiLeaks and obtaining an injunction which temporarily suspended the operation of wikileaks.org. The California judge had the service provider of WikiLeaks block the site's domain (wikileaks.org) on 18 February 2008, although the bank only wanted the documents to be removed but WikiLeaks had failed to name a contact. The website was instantly mirrored by supporters, and later that month the judge overturned his previous decision citing First Amendment concerns and questions about legal jurisdiction. In March 2008, WikiLeaks published what they referred to as \\"the collected secret 'bibles' of Scientology\\", and three days later received letters threatening to sue them for breach of copyright. In September 2008, during the 2008 United States presidential election campaigns, the contents of a Yahoo account belonging to Sarah Palin (the running mate of Republican presidential nominee John McCain) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of a group known as Anonymous. In November 2008, the membership list of the far- right British National Party was posted to WikiLeaks, after appearing briefly on a weblog. A year later, in October 2009, another list of BNP members was leaked. =2009= In January 2009, WikiLeaks released 86 telephone intercept recordings of Peruvian politicians and businessmen involved in the 2008 Peru oil scandal. During February, WikiLeaks released 6,780 Congressional Research Service reports followed in March by a list of contributors to the Norm Coleman senatorial campaign and a set of documents belonging to Barclays Bank that had been ordered removed from the website of The Guardian. In July, it released a report relating to a serious nuclear accident that had occurred at the Iranian Natanz nuclear facility in 2009. Later media reports have suggested that the accident was related to the Stuxnet computer worm. In September, internal documents from Kaupthing Bank were leaked, from shortly before the collapse of Iceland's banking sector, which had caused the 2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis. The document shows that suspiciously large sums of money were loaned to various owners of the bank, and large debts written off. In October, Joint Services Protocol 440, a British document advising the security services on how to avoid documents being leaked, was published by WikiLeaks. Later that month, it announced that a super-injunction was being used by the commodities company Trafigura to stop The Guardian (London) from reporting on a leaked internal document regarding a toxic dumping incident in C√¥te d'Ivoire. In November, it hosted copies of e-mail correspondence between climate scientists, although they were not leaked originally to WikiLeaks. It also released 570,000 intercepts of pager messages sent on the day of the 11 September attacks. During 2008 and 2009, WikiLeaks published the alleged lists of forbidden or illegal web addresses for Australia, Denmark and Thailand. These were originally created to prevent access to child pornography and terrorism, but the leaks revealed that other sites featuring unrelated subjects were also listed. =2010= airstrike of 12 July 2007 in Baghdad, showing the slaying of Namir Noor-Eldeen and a dozen other civilians by a US helicopter. In mid-February 2010, WikiLeaks received a leaked diplomatic cable from the United States Embassy in Reykjavik relating to the Icesave scandal, which they published on 18 February.. WikiLeaks. Retrieved 22 November 2011. The cable, known as Reykjavik 13, was the first of the classified documents WikiLeaks published among those allegedly provided to them by United States Army Private Chelsea Manning (then known as Bradley). In March 2010, WikiLeaks released a secret 32-page US Department of Defense Counterintelligence Analysis Report written in March 2008 discussing the leaking of material by WikiLeaks and how it could be deterred.Stephanie Strom, , New York Times, 17 March 2010. In April, a classified video of the 12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike was released, showing two Reuters employees being fired at, after the pilots mistakenly thought the men were carrying weapons, which were in fact cameras. After the mistaken killing, the video shows US forces firing on a family van that stopped to pick up the bodies. In the week after the release, \\"wikileaks\\" was the search term with the most significant growth worldwide during the last seven days as measured by Google Insights. In June 2010, Manning was arrested after alleged chat logs were given to United States authorities by former hacker Adrian Lamo, in whom she had confided. Manning reportedly told Lamo she had leaked the \\"Collateral Murder\\" video, in addition to a video of the Granai airstrike and about 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks. In July, WikiLeaks released 92,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan between 2004 and the end of 2009 to the publications The Guardian, The New York Times and Der Spiegel. The documents detail individual incidents including \\"friendly fire\\" and civilian casualties. About 15,000 of the 92,000 documents have not yet been released by WikiLeaks, as the group is currently reviewing the documents to remove some of the sources of the information. WikiLeaks asked the Pentagon and human-rights groups to help remove names from the documents to reduce the potential harm caused by their release, but did not receive assistance. After the Love Parade stampede in Duisburg, Germany, on 24 July 2010, a local resident published internal documents of the city administration regarding the planning of Love Parade. The city government reacted by securing a court order on 16 August forcing the removal of the documents from the website on which it was hosted. On 20 August 2010, WikiLeaks released a publication entitled Loveparade 2010 Duisburg planning documents, 2007‚Äì2010, which consisted of 43 internal documents regarding the Love Parade 2010. After the leak of information concerning the Afghan War, in October 2010, around 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq War were released. The BBC quoted the US Department of Defense referring to the Iraq War Logs as \\"the largest leak of classified documents in its history\\". Media coverage of the leaked documents emphasised claims that the US government had ignored reports of torture by the Iraqi authorities during the period after the 2003 war. On 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks added an \\"Insurance file\\" to the Afghan War Diary page. The file is AES encrypted. There has been speculation that it was intended to serve as insurance in case the WikiLeaks website or its spokesman Julian Assange are incapacitated, upon which the passphrase could be published. After the first few days' release of the US diplomatic cables starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcasting company CBS predicted that \\"If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies.\\" CBS correspondent Declan McCullagh stated, \\"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the US government if it were released.\\" =Diplomatic cables release= On 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and five major newspapers from Spain (El Pa√≠s), France (Le Monde), Germany (Der Spiegel), the United Kingdom (The Guardian), and the United States (The New York Times) started simultaneously to publish the first 220 of 251,287 leaked documents labelled confidential ‚Äì but not top-secret ‚Äì and dated from 28 December 1966 to 28 February 2010. WikiLeaks planned to release the entirety of the cables in phases over several months. British Embassy in Madrid, 11 December 2010 The contents of the diplomatic cables include numerous unguarded comments and revelations regarding: US diplomats gathering personal information about Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other top UN officials; critiques and praises about the host countries of various United States embassies; political manoeuvring regarding climate change; discussion and resolutions towards ending ongoing tension in the Middle East; efforts and resistance towards nuclear disarmament; actions in the War on Terror; assessments of other threats around the world; dealings between various countries; United States intelligence and counterintelligence efforts; and other diplomatic actions. Reactions to the United States diplomatic cables leak varied. On 14 December 2010 the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter decided to notify its users. The overthrow of the presidency in Tunisia of 2011 has been attributed partly to reaction against the corruption revealed by leaked cables. On 1 September 2011, it became public that an encrypted version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of un-redacted US State Department cables had been available via BitTorrent for months and that the decryption key (similar to a password) was available to those who knew where to find it.. Guardian. Retrieved 5 September 2011.. Spiegel.de. Retrieved 5 September 2011. Guardian newspaper editor David Leigh and journalist Luke Harding published the decryption key in their book, WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, so the files were now publicly available to anyone. Rather than let malicious actors publish selected data, WikiLeaks decided to publish the entire, unredacted archive in searchable form on its website. =2011‚Äì2015= In late April 2011, files related to the Guantanamo prison were released. In December 2011, WikiLeaks started to release the Spy Files. On 27 February 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing more than five million emails from the Texas-headquartered \\"global intelligence\\" company Stratfor. On 5 July 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing the Syria Files (emails from Syrian political figures 2006‚Äì2012). On 25 October 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Detainee Policies, files covering the rules and procedures for detainees in US military custody. In April 2013 WikiLeaks published more than 1.7 million US diplomatic and intelligence documents from the 1970s, including the Kissinger cables. Embassy of Ecuador, London, 22 August 2012 In 2013, the organisation assisted Edward Snowden (who is responsible for the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures) in leaving Hong Kong. Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks activist, accompanied Snowden on the flight. Scott Shane of The New York Times stated that the WikiLeaks involvement \\"shows that despite its shoestring staff, limited fund-raising from a boycott by major financial firms, and defections prompted by Mr. Assange's personal troubles and abrasive style, it remains a force to be reckoned with on the global stage.\\"Shane, Scott. \\"Offering Snowden Aid, WikiLeaks Gets Back in the Game.\\" The New York Times. 23 June 2013. Retrieved 25 June 2013. In September 2013, WikiLeaks published \\"Spy Files 3\\", 250 documents from more than 90 surveillance companies. On 13 November 2013, a draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership's Intellectual Property Rights chapter was published by WikiLeaks. On 10 June 2015, WikiLeaks published the draft on the Trans-Pacific Partnership's Transparency for Healthcare Annex, along with each country's negotiating position.Sydney Morning Herald: Medicines to cost more and healthcare will suffer, according to Wikileaks documents, 10 June 2015 On 19 June 2015 WikiLeaks began publishing The Saudi Cables: more than half a million cables and other documents from the Saudi Foreign Ministry that contain secret communications from various Saudi Embassies around the world. On 23 June 2015, WikiLeaks published documents under the name of \\"Espionnage √âlys√©e\\", which showed that NSA spied on the French government, including but not limited to then President Francois Hollande and his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac.Liberation.fr: WikiLeaks ‚Äì Chirac, Sarkozy et Hollande : trois pr√©sidents sur √©coute (French), 23 June 2015 On 29 June 2015, WikiLeaks published more NSA top secrets intercepts regarding France, detailing an economic espionage against French companies and associations.Spiegel.de: Wikileaks-Enth√ºllung, NSA soll auch franz√∂sische Wirtschaft bespizelt haben (German), June 2015 In July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that the NSA had tapped the telephones of many German federal ministries, including that of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, for years since the 1990s. On 4 July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that 29 Brazilian government numbers were selected for secret espionage by the NSA. Among the targets were then-President Dilma Rousseff, many assistants and advisors, her presidential jet and other key figures in the Brazilian government.The Intercept: NSA'S Top Brazilian Political and Financial Targets Revealed by Wikileaks Disclosure (English), 4 July 2015 Ecuadorian embassy in London On 29 July 2015, WikiLeaks published a top secret letter from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) Ministerial Meeting in December 2013 which illustrated the position of negotiating countries on \\"state-owned enterprises\\" (SOEs).Sueddeutsche.de: Kommerz statt Sozialstaat (German), 29 July 2015 On 31 July 2015, WikiLeaks published secret intercepts and the related target list showing that the NSA spied on the Japanese government, including the Cabinet and Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui. The documents revealed that United States espionage against Japan concerned broad sections of communications about the US-Japan diplomatic relationship and Japan's position on climate change issues, other than an extensive monitoring of the Japanese economy.The Saturday Paper: Exclusive: US bugs Japan on trade and climate (English), 31 July 2015 On 21 October 2015 WikiLeaks published some of John O. Brennan's emails, including a draft security clearance application which contained personal information. =2016= During the 2016 US Democratic Party presidential primaries, WikiLeaks hosted emails sent or received by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton from her personal mail server while she was Secretary of State. The emails had been released by the US State Department under a Freedom of information request in February 2016. WikiLeaks also created a search engine to allow the public to search through Clinton's emails. The emails were selected in terms of their relevance to the Iraq War and were apparently timed to precede the release of the UK government's Iraq Inquiry report. The emails were a major point of discussion during the 2016 US presidential election, requiring an FBI investigation which decided that Clinton had been \\"extremely careless\\" but recommended that no charges be filed against her. On 19 July 2016, in response to the Turkish government's purges that followed the coup attempt, WikiLeaks released 294,548 emails from Turkey's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). According to WikiLeaks, the material, which they claim to be the first batch from the \\"AKP Emails\\", was obtained a week before the attempted coup in the country and \\"is not connected, in any way, to the elements behind the attempted coup, or to a rival political party or state\\". After WikiLeaks announced that they would release the emails, the organisation was for over 24 hours under a \\"sustained attack\\". Following the leak, the Turkish government ordered the site to be blocked nationwide. WikiLeaks had also tweeted a link to a database which contained sensitive information, such as the Turkish Identification Number, of approximately 50 million Turkish citizens, including nearly every female voter in Turkey. The information first appeared online in April of the same year and was not in the files uploaded by WikiLeaks, but in files archived by Michael Best, who then removed it when the personal data was discovered. On 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks released approximately 20,000 emails and 8,000 files sent from or received by Democratic National Committee (DNC) personnel. Some of the emails contained personal information of donors, including home addresses and Social Security numbers. Other emails appeared to criticise Bernie Sanders or showed favouritism towards Clinton during the primaries. In July 2016, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned her position as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee as a result of the evidence that the Democratic National Committee was \\"effectively an arm of Mrs. Clinton's campaign\\" and had conspired to sabotage Bernie Sander's campaign. On 7 October 2016, WikiLeaks started releasing series of emails and documents sent from or received by Hillary Clinton campaign manager, John Podesta, including Hillary Clinton's paid speeches to banks. According to a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, \\"By dribbling these out every day WikiLeaks is proving they are nothing but a propaganda arm of the Kremlin with a political agenda doing Vladimir Putin's dirty work to help elect Donald Trump.\\" The New York Times reported that when asked, President Vladimir Putin replied that Russia was being falsely accused. \\"The hysteria is merely caused by the fact that somebody needs to divert the attention of the American people from the essence of what was exposed by the hackers.\\" On 17 October 2016, WikiLeaks announced that a \\"state party\\" had severed the Internet connection of Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy. WikiLeaks blamed United States Secretary of State John Kerry of pressuring the Ecuadorian government in severing Assange's Internet, an accusation which the United States State Department denied. The Ecuadorian government stated that it had \\"temporarily\\" severed Assange's Internet connection because of WikiLeaks' release of documents \\"impacting on the U.S. election campaign,\\" although it also stated that this was not meant to prevent WikiLeaks from operating. On 25 November 2016, WikiLeaks released emails and internal documents that provided details on the US military operations in Yemen from 2009 to March 2015. In a statement accompanying the release of the \\"Yemen Files\\", Assange said about the US involvement in the Yemen war: \\"The war in Yemen has produced 3.15 million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare\\". =2017= On 16 February 2017, WikiLeaks released a purported report on CIA espionage orders (marked as NOFORN) for the 2012 French presidential election. The order called for details of party funding, internal rivalries and future attitudes toward the United States. The Associated Press noted that \\"the orders seemed to represent standard intelligence-gathering.\\" On 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks started publishing content code-named \\"Vault 7\\", describing it as containin CIA internal documentation of their \\"massive arsenal\\" of hacking tools including malware, virus projects, weaponised \\"zero day\\" exploits and remote control systems to name a few. Leaked documents, dated from 2013 to 2016, detail the capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. On 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks posted links to e-mails purported to be from Emmanuel Macron's campaign in the French 2017 presidential election. The documents were first relayed on the 4chan forum and by pro-Trump Twitter accounts, and then by WikiLeaks, who indicated they did not author the leaks. Experts have asserted that the WikiLeaks Twitter account played a key role in publicising the leaks through the hashtag #MacronLeaks just some three-and-a-half hours after the first tweet with the hashtag appeared. The campaign stated that false documents were mixed in with real ones, and that \\"the ambition of the authors of this leak is obviously to harm the movement En Marche! in the final hours before the second round of the French presidential election.\\" France's Electoral Commission described the action as a \\"massive and coordinated piracy action.\\" France's Electoral Commission urged journalists not to report on the contents of the leaks, but to heed \\"the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election.\\" Cybersecurity experts initially believed that groups linked to Russia were involved in this attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement. The head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that they did not have evidence connecting the hack with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that \\"we can imagine that it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country.\\" In September 2017, WikiLeaks released \\"Spy Files Russia,\\" revealing \\"how a St. Petersburg-based technology company called Peter-Service helped state entities gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).\\" Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov said that \\"there is some data here that‚Äôs worth publishing. Anything that gets people talking about Russia's capabilities and actions in this area should be seen as a positive development.\\" =2019= Wikileaks released an email where an unnamed member of the team investigating the 2018 chemical attack in Douma (Syria) accused the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of covering up discrepancies.CBS News, Chemical weapons watchdog OPCW defends Syria report as whistleblower claims bias, 25 November 2019 Robert Fisk said that documents released by Wikileaks indicate that the watchdog organisation \\"suppressed or failed to publish, or simply preferred to ignore, the conclusions of up to 20 other members of its staff who became so upset at what they regarded as the misleading conclusions of the final report that they officially sought to have it changed in order to represent the truth\\". The head of OPCW Fernando Arias described the leak as containing \\"subjective views\\" and stood by the original conclusions. On 12 November 2019, WikiLeaks began publishing what it called the Fishrot Files (Icelandic: Samherjaskj√∂lin), a collection of thousands of documents and email communication by employees of one of Iceland's largest fish industry companies, Samherji, that indicated that the company had paid hundreds of millions Icelandic kr√≥na to high ranking politicians and officials in Namibia with the objective of acquiring the country‚Äôs coveted fishing quota. =Claims of upcoming leaks= In January 2011, Rudolf Elmer, a former Swiss banker, passed data containing account details of 2,000 prominent people to Assange, who stated that the information would be vetted before being made publicly available at a later date. In May 2010, WikiLeaks said it had video footage of a massacre of civilians in Afghanistan by the US military which they were preparing to release. In an interview with Chris Anderson on 19 July 2010, Assange showed a document WikiLeaks had on an Albanian oil-well blowout, and said they also had material from inside British Petroleum, and that they were \\"getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high calibre\\" but added that they had not been able to verify and release the material because they did not have enough volunteer journalists. In December 2010, Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC Television that WikiLeaks had information it considered to be a \\"thermo- nuclear device\\" which it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself against the authorities. In a 2009 interview with Computerworld magazine, Assange claimed to be in possession of \\"5GB from Bank of America\\". In 2010, he told Forbes magazine that WikiLeaks was planning another \\"megaleak\\" early in 2011, from the private sector, involving \\"a big U.S. bank\\" and revealing an \\"ecosystem of corruption\\". Bank of America's stock price decreased by 3%, apparently as a result of this announcement. Assange commented on the possible effect of the release that \\"it could take down a bank or two\\". In August 2011, Reuters reported that Daniel Domscheit-Berg had destroyed around 3,000 submissions related to Bank of America (most of them \\"random junk\\"), out of concern over Wikileaks' inadequate protection of sources. The Wikileaks Twitter account (believed to be controlled by Assange) stated \\"five gigabytes from the Bank of America\\" had been deleted, but Domscheit-Berg stated that he had only destroyed material received after Assange's Computerworld interview, and raised the possibility that Assange had lost access to the material because of technical deficiencies in Wikileaks' submission system. In October 2010, Assange told a major Moscow newspaper that \\"The Kremlin had better brace itself for a coming wave of WikiLeaks disclosures about Russia\\". Assange later clarified: \\"we have material on many businesses and governments, including in Russia. It's not right to say there's going to be a particular focus on Russia\\". Authenticity WikiLeaks has contended in 2010 that it has never released a misattributed document and that documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks \\"are already well-placed in the mainstream media. WikiLeaks is of no additional assistance.\\" The FAQ states that: \\"The simplest and most effective countermeasure is a worldwide community of informed users and editors who can scrutinise and discuss leaked documents.\\" According to statements by Assange in 2010, submitted documents are vetted by a group of five reviewers, with expertise in different topics such as language or programming, who also investigate the background of the leaker if his or her identity is known. In that group, Assange has the final decision about the assessment of a document. Columnist Eric Zorn wrote in 2016 \\"So far, it's possible, even likely, that every stolen email WikiLeaks has posted has been authentic,\\" but cautioned against assuming that future releases would be equally authentic.Eric Zorn, The inherent peril in trusting whatever WikiLeaks dumps on us, Chicago Tribune (13 October 2016). Writer Glenn Greenwald asserted in 2016 that WikiLeaks has a \\"perfect, long-standing record of only publishing authentic documents.\\" However, cybersecurity experts agree that it is trivially easy for a person to fabricate an email or alter it, as by changing headers and metadata. Some of the releases, including many of the Podesta emails, contain DKIM headers. This allows them to be verified as genuine to some degree of certainty. In July 2016, the Aspen Institute's Homeland Security Group, a bipartisan counterterrorism organisation, warned that hackers who stole authentic data might \\"salt the files they release with plausible forgeries.\\" Russian intelligence agencies have frequently used disinformation tactics, \\"which means carefully faked emails might be included in the WikiLeaks dumps. After all, the best way to make false information believable is to mix it in with true information.\\"Douglas Perry, How Russian disinformation could be driving the Hillary Clinton WikiLeaks email scandal, The Oregonian/OregonLive (18 October 2016). Promotion of conspiracy theories  =Murder of Seth Rich= WikiLeaks has promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right- wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich was the source of leaked emails and was killed for working with WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks fuelled the conspiracy theories when it offered a $20,000 reward for information on Rich's killer and when Assange implied that Rich was the source of the DNC leaks. No evidence supports the claim that Rich was the source of the leaks. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 election said that Assange \\"implied falsely\\" that Rich was the source in order to obscure that Russia was the actual source.Mueller Report, vol I. p. 48: Beginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements about Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016. The statements about Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails. The Guardian wrote that WikiLeaks, along with individuals and groups on the hard right, had been involved in the \\"ruthless exploitation of [Rich's] death for political purposes\\". The executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, an organisation that advocates for open government, was critical of WikiLeaks' fuelling of conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich: \\"If they feel like they have a link to the staffer's death, they should say it and be responsible about it. The insinuations, to me, are just disgusting.\\" =Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton= WikiLeaks has popularised conspiracies about the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, such as tweeting articles which suggested Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta engaged in satanic rituals, implying that the Democratic Party had Seth Rich killed, claiming that Hillary Clinton wanted to drone strike Assange, suggesting that Clinton wore earpieces to debates and interviews, promoting conspiracy theories about Clinton's health, and promoting a conspiracy theory from a Donald Trump‚Äìrelated Internet community tying the Clinton campaign to child kidnapper Laura Silsby. Criticism and controversies =Allegations of anti-Americanism= WikiLeaks has been accused of purposely targeting certain states and people, and presenting its disclosures in misleading and conspiratorial ways to harm those people. Writing in 2012, Foreign Policy's Joshua Keating stated that \\"nearly all its major operations have targeted the U.S. government or American corporations.\\" In a 2017 speech addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies, former CIA Director Mike Pompeo referred to WikiLeaks as \\"a non-state hostile intelligence service\\" and described founder Julian Assange as a narcissist, fraud, and coward. = Allegations of anti-Clinton and pro-Trump bias = Assange wrote on WikiLeaks in February 2016: \\"I have had years of experience in dealing with Hillary Clinton and have read thousands of her cables. Hillary lacks judgement and will push the United States into endless, stupid wars which spread terrorism. ... she certainly should not become president of the United States.\\" In July 2017, during an interview by Amy Goodman, Julian Assange said that choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is like choosing between cholera or gonorrhea. \\"Personally, I would prefer neither.\\"\\"Assange: 2016 election is like choosing between 'cholera or gonorrhea'\\". Politico. 27 July 2016. WikiLeaks editor Sarah Harrison stated that the site was not choosing which damaging publications to release, rather releasing information available to them. In an Election Day statement, Assange criticised both Clinton and Trump, saying that \\"The Democratic and Republican candidates have both expressed hostility towards whistleblowers.\\" In conversations that were leaked in February 2018, Assange expressed a preference for a Republican victory in the 2016 election, saying that \\"Dems+Media+liberals woudl [sic] then form a block to reign [sic] in their worst qualities. With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities, dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.\\". In further leaked correspondence with the Trump campaign on election day (8 November 2016), WikiLeaks encouraged the Trump campaign to contest the election results as being \\"rigged\\" should they lose. Having released information that exposed the inner workings of a broad range of organisations and politicians, WikiLeaks started by 2016 to focus almost exclusively on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In the 2016 US presidential election, WikiLeaks only exposed material damaging to the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton. WikiLeaks even rejected the opportunity to publish unrelated leaks, because it dedicated all its resources to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. According to The New York Times, WikiLeaks timed one of its large leaks so that it would happen on the eve of the Democratic Convention. The Washington Post noted that the leaks came at an important sensitive moment in the Clinton campaign, as she was preparing to announce her vice-presidential pick and unite the party behind her. The Sunlight Foundation, an organisation that advocates for open government, said that such actions meant that WikiLeaks was no longer striving to be transparent but rather sought to achieve political goals. WikiLeaks explained its actions in a 2017 statement to Foreign Policy: \\"WikiLeaks schedules publications to maximize readership and reader engagement. During distracting media events such as the Olympics or a high profile election, unrelated publications are sometimes delayed until the distraction passes but never are rejected for this reason.\\" On 7 October 2016, an hour after the media had begun to dedicate wall-to-wall coverage of the revelation that Trump had bragged on video about sexually harassing women, WikiLeaks began to release emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. CNN notes that due to extensive coverage of the Trump tapes, the leaks were an \\"afterthought\\" in news coverage. Podesta suggested that the emails were timed to deflect attention from the Trump tapes. In 2010, Donald Trump called WikiLeaks \\"disgraceful\\" and suggested that the \\"death penalty\\" should be a punishment for WikiLeaks' releases of information.\\"Trump in 2010: WikiLeaks 'disgraceful,' there 'should be like death penalty or something'\\". CNN. 4 January 2017. Following the dump of e-mails hacked from the Hillary Clinton campaign, Donald Trump told voters, \\"I love WikiLeaks!\\"Hench, Mark (10 October 2016) \\"Trump: 'I love WikiLeaks.'\\" The Hill. (Retrieved 7 March 2017.) Trump made many references to WikiLeaks during the course of the campaign; by one estimate, he referenced disclosures by WikiLeaks over 160 times in speeches during the last 30 days of the campaign. In October 2017, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a company working on behalf of the Trump presidential campaign, had contacted WikiLeaks about missing Hillary Clinton e-mails and the possibility of creating a searchable database for the campaign to use. After this was reported, Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks had been approached by Cambridge Analytica but had rejected the approach. WikiLeaks did not disclose what the subject of Cambridge Analytica's approach was.  Correspondence between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr.  In November 2017, it was revealed that the WikiLeaks Twitter account corresponded with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 presidential election. The correspondence shows how WikiLeaks actively solicited the co-operation of Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate and advisor in the campaign of his father. WikiLeaks urged the Trump campaign to reject the results of the 2016 presidential election at a time when it looked as if the Trump campaign would lose. WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share a claim by Assange that Hillary Clinton had wanted to attack him with drones. WikiLeaks also shared a link to a site that would help people to search through WikiLeaks documents. Trump Jr. shared both. After the election, WikiLeaks also requested that the president-elect push Australia to appoint Assange as ambassador to the US. After The New York Times published a fragment of Donald Trump's tax returns for one year, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for one or more of his father's tax returns, explaining that it would be in his father's best interest because it would \\"dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality\\" and not come \\"through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC).\\" WikiLeaks also asked Trump Jr. to leak his own e-mails to them days after The New York Times broke a story about e-mail correspondence between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-affiliated lawyer; WikiLeaks said that it would be \\"beautifully confounding\\" for them to publish the e-mails and that it would deprive other news outlets from putting a negative spin on the correspondence. Trump Jr. provided this correspondence to congressional investigators looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. = Allegations of Russian influence = In August 2016, after WikiLeaks published thousands of DNC emails, it was claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to WikiLeaks. At the time, DNC officials made such claims, along with a number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms. Assange accused the Clinton campaign of stoking \\"a neo-McCarthy hysteria\\". In October 2016, the US intelligence community announced that it was \\"confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations\\". The US intelligence agencies said that the hacks were consistent with the methods of Russian-directed efforts, and that people high up within the Kremlin were likely involved. On 14 October 2016, CNN reported that \\"there is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the U.S. presidential election.\\"Jim Sciutto, Nicole Gaouette and Ryan Browne (14 October 2016). US finds growing evidence Russia feeding emails to WikiLeaks. CNN. Retrieved 14 October 2016. WikiLeaks has denied any connection to or co-operation with Russia. President Putin has strongly denied any Russian involvement in the election. In September 2016, the German weekly magazine Focus reported that according to a confidential German government dossier, WikiLeaks had long since been infiltrated by Russian agents aiming to discredit NATO governments. The magazine added that French and British intelligence services had come to the same conclusion and said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev receive details about what WikiLeaks publishes before publication.Russischer Geheimdienst nutzt WikiLeaks f√ºr Kampagnen Focus 23 September 2016 The Focus report followed a New York Times story that suggested that WikiLeaks may be a laundering machine for compromising material about Western countries gathered by Russian spies.How Russia Often Benefits When Julian Assange Reveals the West's Secrets The New York Times 31 August 2016 On 10 December 2016, The Washington Post reported that the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Russia intelligence operatives provided materials to WikiLeaks in an effort to help Donald Trump's election bid. WikiLeaks has frequently been criticised for its alleged absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia. In April 2016, WikiLeaks tweeted criticism of the Panama Papers, which had among other things revealed Russian businesses and individuals linked with offshore ties. The WikiLeaks Twitter account tweeted, \\"#PanamaPapers Putin attack was produced by OCCRP which targets Russia & former USSR and was funded by USAID and [George] Soros\\". Putin would later go on to dismiss the Panama Papers by citing WikiLeaks: \\"WikiLeaks has showed us that official people and official organs of the U.S. are behind this.\\" According to The New York Times, both Assange claims are substance-free: \\"there is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers.\\" In 2012, as WikiLeaks was under a financial blockade, Assange began to host a television show that was distributed by Journeyman Pictures and aired on Russia Today. Assange has never disclosed how much he or WikiLeaks were paid for his television show. Writing in Salon, Glenn Greenwald disputed that Assange represented the views of the Russian government in the show, arguing that the views Assange presented in his interview with Hassan Nasrallah were strongly critical of the Syrian government, a Russian ally. After President Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn resigned in February 2017 due to reports over his communications with Russian officials and subsequent lies over the content and nature of those communications, WikiLeaks tweeted that Flynn resigned \\"after [a] destabilization campaign by U.S. spies, Democrats, press.\\" In April 2017, the WikiLeaks Twitter account suggested that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack, which international human rights organisations and governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel attributed to the Syrian government, was a false flag attack. WikiLeaks stated that \\"while western establishment media beat the drum for more war in Syria the matter is far from clear\\", and shared a video by a Syrian activist who claimed that Islamist extremists were probably behind the chemical attack, not the Syrian government. In May 2017, cybersecurity experts stated that they believed that groups affiliated with the Russian government were involved in the hacking and leaking of e-mails associated with the Emmanuel Macron campaign; these e-mails were published on Pastebin but heavily promoted by WikiLeaks social media channels. In April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo stated: \\"It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is ‚Äì a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.\\" Pompeo said that the US Intelligence Community had concluded that Russia's \\"primary propaganda outlet,\\" RT had \\"actively collaborated\\" with WikiLeaks. In August 2017, Foreign Policy reported that WikiLeaks had in the summer of 2016 turned down a large cache of documents containing information damaging to the Russian government. WikiLeaks stated that, \\"As far as we recall these are already public ... WikiLeaks rejects all information that it cannot verify. WikiLeaks rejects submissions that have already been published elsewhere\\". News outlets had reported on contents of the leaks in 2014, amounting to less than half of the data that was allegedly made available to WikiLeaks in the summer of 2016. In September 2017, WikiLeaks released the \\"Spy Files Russia,\\" which detailed Russian government surveillance of internet and cellphone users in the country. =Allegations of anti-semitism= WikiLeaks has been accused of anti-semitism both in its Twitter activity and hiring decisions. According to Ian Hislop, Assange claimed that a \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" was attempting to discredit the organisation. Assange denied making this remark, stating \\"'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and in word. It is serious and upsetting.\\" In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, the WikiLeaks Twitter account wrote that \\"the Jewish pro-censorship lobby legitimized attacks\\", referring to the trial of Maurice Sinet. In July 2016, the same account suggested that triple parentheses, or (((echoes))) ‚Äì a tool used by neo-Nazis to identify Jews on Twitter, appropriated by several Jews online out of solidarity ‚Äì had been used as a way for \\"establishment climbers\\" to identify one another. In leaked internal conversations, the WikiLeaks Twitter account, thought to be controlled by Assange at the time, discussed an article critical of WikiLeaks by Associated Press reporter Raphael Satter. The WikiLeaks Twitter account went on call the journalist \\"a rat\\", adding \\"but he's Jewish\\" and encouraged others to troll him. =Exaggerated and misleading descriptions of the contents of leaks= WikiLeaks has been criticised for making misleading claims about the contents of its leaks. Media outlets have also been criticised for uncritically repeating WikiLeaks' misleading claims about its leaks. According to University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci, this is part of a pattern of behaviour. According to Tufekci, there are three steps to WikiLeaks' \\"disinformation campaigns\\": \\"The first step is to dump many documents at once ‚Äî rather than allowing journalists to scrutinise them and absorb their significance before publication. The second step is to sensationalise the material with misleading news releases and tweets. The third step is to sit back and watch as the news media unwittingly promotes the WikiLeaks agenda under the auspices of independent reporting.\\" After the 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt, WikiLeaks announced that it would release e-mails belonging to Turkey's ruling conservative Justice and Development Party. WikiLeaks released Turkish emails and documents as a response to the Turkish government's crackdown on real or alleged government opponents that followed the coup attempt. When these e-mails were released, however, it \\"was nothing but mundane mailing lists of tens of thousands of ordinary people who discussed politics online. Back then, too, the ruse worked: Many Western journalists had hyped these non-leaks.\\" = Inadequate curation and violations of personal privacy = WikiLeaks has drawn criticism for violating the personal privacy of individuals and inadequately curating its content. These critics include transparency advocates, such as Edward Snowden, the Sunlight Foundation and the Federation of American Scientists. WikiLeaks has published individuals' Social Security numbers, medical information, and credit card numbers. An analysis by the Associated Press found that WikiLeaks had in one of its mass-disclosures published \\"the personal information of hundreds of people ‚Äì including sick children, rape victims and mental health patients\\". WikiLeaks has named teenage rape victims, and outed an individual arrested for homosexuality in Saudi Arabia. Some of WikiLeaks' cables \\"described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees\\". An analysis of WikiLeaks' Saudi cables \\"turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files ... three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables ‚Äì including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates that proclaims whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C.\\" Two individuals named in the DNC leaks were targeted by identity thieves following WikiLeaks' release of their Social Security and credit card information. In its leak of DNC e-mails, WikiLeaks revealed the details of an ordinary staffer's suicide attempt and brought attention to it through a tweet. WikiLeaks' publishing of Sony's hacked e-mails drew criticism for violating the privacy of Sony's employees and for failing to be in the public interest. Michael A. Cohen, a fellow at the Century Foundation, argues that \\"data dumps like these represent a threat to our already shrinking zone of privacy.\\" He noted that the willingness of WikiLeaks to publish information of this type encourages hacking and cyber theft: \\"With ready and willing amplifiers, what's to deter the next cyberthief from stealing a company's database of information and threatening to send it to Wikileaks if a list of demands aren't met?\\" The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates for open government, has criticised WikiLeaks for inadequate curation of its content and for \\"weaponised transparency,\\" writing that with the DNC leaks, \\"Wikileaks again failed the due diligence review we expect of putatively journalistic entities when it published the personal information of ordinary citizens, including passport and Social Security numbers contained in the hacked emails of Democratic National Committee staff. We are not alone in raising ethical questions about Wikileaks' shift from whistleblower to platform for weaponised transparency. Any organisation that 'doxxes' a public is harming privacy.\\" The manner in which WikiLeaks publishes content can have the effect of censoring political enemies: \\"Wikileaks' indiscriminate disclosure in this case is perhaps the closest we've seen in reality to the bogeyman projected by enemies to reform ‚Äî that transparency is just a Trojan Horse for chilling speech and silencing political enemies.\\" In July 2016, Edward Snowden criticised WikiLeaks for insufficiently curating its content. When Snowden made data public, he did so by working with the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news organisations, choosing only to make documents public which exposed National Security Agency surveillance programs. Content that compromised national security or exposed sensitive personal information was withheld. WikiLeaks, on the other hand, made little effort to do either, Snowden said. WikiLeaks responded by accusing Snowden of pandering to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. University of North Carolina Professor Zeynep Tufekci has also criticised WikiLeaks for exposing sensitive personal information. She argued that data dumps, such as WikiLeaks, which violate personal privacy without being in the public interest \\"threaten our ability to dissent by destroying privacy and unleashing a glut of questionable information that functions, somewhat unexpectedly, as its own form of censorship, rather than as a way to illuminate the maneuverings of the powerful.\\" In January 2017, the WikiLeaks Task Force, a Twitter account associated with WikiLeaks, proposed the creation of a database to track verified Twitter users, including sensitive personal information on individuals' homes, families and finances. According to the Chicago Tribune, \\"the proposal faced a sharp and swift backlash as technologists, journalists and security researchers slammed the idea as a 'sinister' and dangerous abuse of power and privacy.\\" Twitter furthermore bans the use of Twitter data for \\"surveillance purposes,\\" stating \\"Posting another person's private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules.\\" =Internal conflicts and lack of transparency= Within WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the website's former German representative who was suspended by Assange. Domscheit-Berg announced on 28 September 2010 that he was leaving the organisation due to internal conflicts over management of the website. Julian Assange (left) with Daniel Domscheit-Berg who was ejected from WikiLeaks and started a rival \\"whistleblower\\" organisation named OpenLeaks. On 25 September 2010, after being suspended by Assange for \\"disloyalty, insubordination and destabilisation\\", Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the German spokesman for WikiLeaks, told Der Spiegel that he was resigning, saying \\"WikiLeaks has a structural problem. I no longer want to take responsibility for it, and that's why I am leaving the project.\\" Assange accused Domscheit- Berg of leaking information to Newsweek, with Domscheit-Berg claiming that the WikiLeaks team was unhappy with Assange's management and handling of the Afghan war document releases. Daniel Domscheit-Berg wanted greater transparency in the articles released to the public. Another vision of his was to focus on providing technology that allowed whistle-blowers to protect their identity as well as a more transparent way of communicating with the media, forming new partnerships and involving new people. Domscheit-Berg left with a small group to start OpenLeaks, a new leak organisation and website with a different management and distribution philosophy. While leaving, Daniel Domscheit-Berg copied and then deleted roughly 3,500 unpublished documents from the WikiLeaks servers,. Edition.cnn.com. Retrieved 22 November 2011. including information on the US government's 'no-fly list' and inside information from 20 right-wing organisations, and according to a WikiLeaks statement, 5 gigabytes of data relating to Bank of America, the internal communications of 20 neo-Nazi organisations and US intercept information for \\"over a hundred Internet companies\\". In Domscheit-Berg's book he wrote: \\"To this day, we are waiting for Julian to restore security, so that we can return the material to him, which was on the submission platform.\\". Wired.com (10 February 2011). Retrieved 22 November 2011. In August 2011, Domscheit-Berg claimed he permanently deleted the files \\"in order to ensure that the sources are not compromised.\\". Spiegel.de. Retrieved 22 November 2011. Herbert Snorrason, a 25-year-old Icelandic university student, resigned after he challenged Assange on his decision to suspend Domscheit-Berg and was bluntly rebuked. Iceland MP Birgitta J√≥nsd√≥ttir also left WikiLeaks, citing lack of transparency, lack of structure, and poor communication flow in the organisation. According to the British newspaper, The Independent, at least a dozen key supporters of WikiLeaks left the website during 2010. Non- disclosure agreements Those working for WikiLeaks are reportedly required to sign sweeping non-disclosure agreements covering all conversations, conduct, and material, with Assange having sole power over disclosure. The penalty for non-compliance in one such agreement was reportedly ¬£12 million. WikiLeaks has been challenged for this practice, as it is seen to be hypocritical for an organisation dedicated to transparency to limit the transparency of its inner workings and limit the accountability of powerful individuals in the organisation. =Lawsuit by the Democratic National Committee= On 20 April 2018, the Democratic National Committee filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit in federal district court in Manhattan against Russia, the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, alleging a conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 United States presidential election in Trump's favour. The suit was dismissed with prejudice on 30 July 2019. In his judgement, Judge John Koeltl said that WikiLeaks \\"did not participate in any wrongdoing in obtaining the materials in the first place\\" and was therefore within the law in publishing the information. He also said that the DNC case was \\"entirely divorced\\" from the facts. The suit could not be refiled due to its \\"substantive legal defect\\". The federal judge also wrote ‚ÄúThe DNC‚Äôs interest in keeping ‚Äòdonor lists‚Äô and ‚Äòfundraising strategies‚Äô secret is dwarfed by the newsworthiness of the documents as a whole‚Äù...‚ÄúIf WikiLeaks could be held liable for publishing documents concerning the DNC‚Äôs political financial and voter-engagement strategies simply because the DNC labels them ‚Äòsecret‚Äô and trade secrets, then so could any newspaper or other media outlet.‚Äù Koeltl also said U.S. courts were not the place for the DNC to seek damages against Russia over the hacking. ‚ÄúRelief from the alleged activities of the Russian Federation should be sought from the political branches of the Government and not from the court‚Äù. Reception Graffiti in Bilbao \\"We want to know.\\" =Awards and praise= Wikileaks won a number of awards in its early years, including The Economist's New Media Award in 2008 at the Index on Censorship Awards and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009. In 2010, the New York Daily News listed WikiLeaks first among websites \\"that could totally change the news\\". Julian Assange received the 2010 Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence for releasing secret U.S. military reports on the Iraq and Afghan wars and was named the Readers' Choice for TIME's Person of the Year in 2010. The UK Information Commissioner has stated that \\"WikiLeaks is part of the phenomenon of the online, empowered citizen\\". During its first days, an Internet petition in support of WikiLeaks attracted more than six hundred thousand signatures. Support for good use of free speech Members of the media and academia commended Wikileaks during its early years for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. In 2010, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the \\"cyber war\\" being led at the time against WikiLeaks, and in a joint statement with the Organization of American States the UN Special Rapporteur called on states and other people to keep international legal principles in mind. =Public positions taken by politicians concerning Wikileaks= In 2010, after WikiLeaks' release of classified U.S. government documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, U.S. Vice- President Joe Biden likened Julian Assange to a \\"high-tech terrorist,\\" stating that he had put people's lives in danger. Several Republicans who had once been highly critical of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange began to speak fondly of him after WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and started to regularly criticise Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Having called WikiLeaks \\"disgraceful\\" in 2010, President-Elect Donald Trump praised WikiLeaks in October 2016, saying, \\"I love WikiLeaks.\\" In 2019, Trump said \\"I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It‚Äôs not my thing.\\" Newt Gingrich, who called for Assange to be \\"treated as an enemy combatant\\" in 2010, praised him as a \\"down to Earth, straight forward interviewee\\" in 2017. Sean Hannity, who had in 2010 said that Assange waged a \\"war\\" on the United States, praised him in 2016 for showing \\"how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is\\". Sarah Palin, who had in 2010 described Assange as an \\"anti-American operative with blood on his hands\\", praised Assange in 2017. Tulsi Gabbard spoke of the \\"chilling effect on investigative journalism\\", first of the US government's reclassification of Wikileaks (from \\"news organization\\" during the Obama administration to \\"hostile intelligence service\\" after the 2016 election), then of his arrest. On 16 April 2019, Mairead Maguire accepted the 2019 GUE/NGL Award for Journalists, Whistleblowers & Defenders of the Right to Information on Julian Assange's behalf. =Concerns from U.S. government= Several US government officials have criticised WikiLeaks for exposing classified information and claimed that the leaks harm national security and compromise international diplomacy. Several human rights organisations requested with respect to earlier document releases that WikiLeaks adequately redact the names of civilians working with international forces, to prevent repercussions. Some journalists have likewise criticised a perceived lack of editorial discretion when releasing thousands of documents at once and without sufficient analysis. In 2016, Harvard law professor and Electronic Frontier Foundation board member Jonathan Zittrain argued that a culture in which one constantly risks being \\"outed\\" as a result of virtual Watergate-like break-ins (or violations of the Fourth Amendment) could lead people to hesitate to speak their minds. In April 2017, CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks \\"a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia\\". Also in April 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that arresting Assange was a priority: \\"We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks and some of them are quite serious. So yes, it is a priority. We've already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail.\\" =Campaigns to discredit Wikileaks= In 2010 the Bank of America employed the services of a group of information security firms collectively known as Team Themis when it became concerned about information that Wikileaks held about it and was planning to release. Team Themis included private intelligence and security firms HBGary Federal, Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies. In 2011 hacktivist group Anonymous released emails it had obtained from HBGary Federal. Among other things, the emails revealed that Team Themis had planned to sabotage and discredit Wikileaks using various plans. One plan was to attack Wikileaks servers and obtain information about document submitters to \\"kill the project\\". Another was to submit fake documents to Wikileaks and then call out the error. A further plan involved pressuring supporters of Wikileaks such as journalist Glenn Greenwald. The plans were not implemented and, after the emails were published, Palantir CEO Alex Karp issued a public apology for his company‚Äôs role. = Spin-offs = Release of United States diplomatic cables was followed by the creation of a number of other organisations based on the WikiLeaks model. * OpenLeaks was created by a former WikiLeaks spokesperson. Daniel Domscheit-Berg said the intention was to be more transparent than WikiLeaks. OpenLeaks was supposed to start public operations in early 2011 but despite much media coverage, it is not operating. * In December 2011, WikiLeaks launched Friends of WikiLeaks, a social network for supporters and founders of the website. * On 9 September 2013 a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks, which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media using the GlobaLeaks whistleblowing software. * RuLeaks is aimed at being a Russian equivalent to WikiLeaks. It was initiated originally to provide translated versions of the WikiLeaks cables but as of 2011 it had started to publish its own content as well. * Leakymails is a project designed to obtain and publish relevant documents exposing corruption of the political class and the powerful in Argentina. =In popular culture= * Mediastan is a documentary released in 2013, directed by Johannes Wahlstr√∂m, featuring the people behind Wikileaks. * Underground: The Julian Assange Story is a biography movie of the early life of Julian Assange, directed by Robert Connolly. * The documentary We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks by director Alex Gibney premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. * The Fifth Estate is a film directed by Bill Condon, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange. The film is based on Wikileaks defector Domscheit-Berg's book Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website, as well as WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy by David Leigh and Luke Harding. * War, Lies and Videotape is a documentary by French directors Paul Moreira and Luc Hermann from press agency Premieres Lignes. The film was first released in France, in 2011 and then broadcast worldwide. * The Source is a 2014 oratorio by Ted Hearne, with a libretto by Mark Doten that features WikiLeaks document disclosures by Chelsea Manning. Both The Fifth Estate and We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks have been criticised by WikiLeaks because of what it claims are fabrications and irresponsibility. = Ecuador = On 11 April 2019, Ecuador withdrew Julian Assange's asylum and invited the police into its embassy to arrest him. Later in April Ecuador detained Ola Bini and froze his bank accounts saying that he was under investigation for cyber-attack charges. Ecuador authorities said Bini was a key member of Wikileaks and close to Assange.

Ebenezer Sibly Life He was the son of Edmund Sibly and Mary Larkholm, born in the parish of Cripplegate ward, London. He was the brother of Manoah Sibly. He early devoted himself to medicine, and also to astrology. He studied surgery in London. In 1785 he was working as an astrologer in Bristol; and by about 1788 had moved to London. In 1789 he became the first master of the Lodge of Joppa #188, one of the founding masonic lodges under the Ancient Grand Lodge of England. In 1790 he was temporarily in Ipswich, supporting Sir John Hadley D'Oyly, the Whig member, at the general election. On 20 April 1792 he graduated M.D. from King's College, Aberdeen. As a student of medicine, he became interested in the theories on animal magnetism of Anton Mesmer, joining Mesmer's Harmonic Philosophical School, and later also theosophy.Debus p. 261 Sibly died in London in about 1799. Works Sibly is celebrated for the natal horoscope he cast of the United States of America, published in 1787 and still cited. =Translations= Ebenezer Sibly used an eclectic mixture of early modern esoteric works. His brother Manoah Sibly (1757‚Äì1840) was a linguist, as well as a Swedenborgian preacher. Under Manoah's name appeared texts including a revision of John Whalley's translation of the Tetrabiblos, and a translation of Placidus de Titis; as an astrologer, Ebenezer is said to have used the Placidian system of houses; as a student of alchemy, he translated Bernard of Treviso (the fountain allegory).Debus p. 263. It has been said that experts of the time would have seen that Sibly was not very discriminating about the sources he chose, and drew on unpublished translations that he had borrowed.Joscelyn Godwin, The Theosophical Enlightenment (1994), p. 107; Google Books. He knew the Book of Enoch via Charles Rainsford.Martha Keith Schuchard, Why Mrs. Blake Cried (2006), p. 272. =The Complete Illustration= Sibly published the New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology in four volumes, from 1784.Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Esotericism and the Academy: Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture (2012), p. 237; Google Books.Volume 4 is available online. He had completed it by the time he moved to London. The work, which had later editions under variant titles, gave details of magical procedure, and an account of the spirit world derived from Reginald Scot, in the 1665 edition of Discoverie of Witchcraft.Owen Davies, Grimoires: A History of Magic Books (2009), p. 134. Revised editions appeared posthumously as Astrology, A New and Complete Illustration of the Occult Sciences by Ebenezer Sibly, M.D. F.R.H.S., Embellished with Curious Copper-Plates, London (1806), and The New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology (1817). John Ames =Other works= Sibly published A Key to Physic, and the Occult Sciences, in 1792. Sibly wrote a book called Universal System of Natural History in 1794. In the book, in a form of environmental monogenism, he claimed that the White Race was the first on earth: > ‚ÄúWe must consider white as the stock whence all others have sprung, Adam and > Eve and all their posterity, till the time of the deluge were white; in the > first age of the world no black nation was to be found on the face of the > earth.‚Äù Sibly believed that humans had not reached Africa until after the dispersal from the Tower of Babel, that the continent's first inhabitants had been white, and that Africans had become dark only as a result of climate.Colin Kidd, The Forging of Races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000 2006, p. 30; Google Books. The original version of Culpeper's English Physician and Complete Herbal was published in 1652 without illustrations.

It consists of the mountains to the north of Glen Shiel and the A87 road between the heads of Loch Duich and Loch Cluanie; its boundaries, other than Glen Shiel, are generally taken to be the valleys of Strath Croe and Gleann Gaorsaic to the north and An Caorann M√≤r to the east. Although close to the west coast the mountains lie on the main east- west watershed of Scotland, as the northern side of Kintail drains via Glen AffricOrdnance Survey. Landranger 1:50000 Map Sheet 33 (Loch Alsh, Glen Shiel & Loch Hourn) to the east coast. Kintail gives its name to the Kintail National Scenic Area, one of the forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area includes the mountains of Kintail proper, as well as the southern side of Glen Shiel from the site of the Battle of Glen Shiel west to the shores of Loch Duich, and extends west to as far as Dornie on the north shore of Loch Duich. The designated area covers 17,149 ha in total, of which 16,070 ha is on land, with a further 1079 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level), consisting of the sea loch of Loch Duich. The area is considered to encapsulate the scenery of the west highlands, being composed of ridges and peaks that rise steeply from narrow glens and the sea. The main settlement within Kintail is Morvich, located to the northwest of the mountains, just off the A87 road. Morvich serves as the location of the base for Kintail Mountain Rescue Team, as well a campsite operated by The Caravan Club. Mountains Four of the Five Sisters of Kintail from Shiel Bridge The hills to the north-east of Glen Shiel are known as the Five Sisters Of Kintail (Gaelic: C√≤ig Peathraichean Chinn T√†ile, although the name is not derived from the Gaelic), and form a high ridge some long rising steeply from Glen Shiel to a maximum height of 1,067 metres (3,501 feet). According to legend, the five sisters are the oldest of seven sisters, as the youngest two sisters fell in love with two Irish princes who washed ashore during a storm. Their father would only allow them to marry once the older sisters has also been married, and so the princes agreed to send their other five brothers once they had returned to Ireland with their new wives. Although the princes failed to appear, the five sisters continued to wait, eventually turning into mountains to extend their vigil into eternity. The five distinctly pointed summits (Sg√πrr na Ciste Duibhe, Sg√πrr na C√†rnach, Sg√πrr Fhuaran, Sg√πrr nan Saighead and Sgurr na Moraich) are a well-known landmark and a popular hillwalking expedition. Three of the Five Sisters, which are all over 3,000 feet, are classified as full Munros, with the other two being subsidiary Munro tops.D. Bennet & R. Anderson. The Munros: Scottish Mountaineering Club Hillwalkers Guide, pp. 193-195. Published 2016. The ridge containing the Five Sisters continues unbroken to the east where it takes in a further three Munros (Sg√πrr a' Bhealaich Dheirg, S√†ileag and Aonach Meadhoin) which are often known as the Brothers of Kintail. Beinn Fhada (Ben Attow) is the other main mountain in the area. Ownership Most of Kintail is owned by the National Trust for Scotland (NTS). The Trust's Kintail and Morvich estate covers and includes the Falls of Glomach, one of the highest waterfalls in Great Britain. The estate was purchased for the NTS in 1944 by Percy Unna, the Scottish Mountaineering Club president who also acquired Glen Coe for the Trust. NTS operate an outdoor education centre in Morvich, which provides accommodation for groups such as school parties undertaking field studies and outdoor pursuits. Wildlife and nature Bird species found within Kintail include golden eagles, merlins and black-throated divers. Otters are relatively common, and pine martens also inhabit the wooded parts of the area, whilst red deer can be seen on the lower slopes of the mountains. Kintail is also home to herd of feral goats, thought to be descendants of goats first brought to Britain in around 3000 BCE by neolithic farmers. Due to this origin they are considered non-native, and as there are currently no top predators for goats NTS are considering a cull to reduce the herd, which currently numbers around 100, in order to reduce pressures on vegetation and allow the area of land covered by native woodland to increase. Historical landmarks A 1.75 m high, 2,000-year-old standing stone known as Cill Fhearchair stands within a burial ground near Shiel Bridge. A large boulder lying on the steep southwest slopes of Sg√πrr na Ciste Duibhe is known as \\"Prince Charlie's Stone\\", as it the place where Charles Edward Stuart spent a day in the summer of 1746 hiding from government troops.

The house dates from the 16th century, was substantially enlarged in the early 17th century, and has been altered several times since. Its location at grid reference is to the east of the town centre, on the south side of the High Street. The building now forms part of Loretto School, an independent boarding school. Pinkie House is not far from the site of the disastrous Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, fought in 1547. History The name Pinkie, first recorded in the 12th century as Pontekyn, may derive from the Welsh words pant (valley) and cyn (wedge), referring to its situation at the end of the valley of the Esk. Pinkie was formerly the country seat of the abbots of Dunfermline, and the tower house was built some time in the 16th century on the site of the Battle of Pinkie.Bath M.

He served as James VI's chancellor, and was created Earl of Dunfermline in 1605. The young Prince Charles, later Charles I, lived here as a boy, after his father's move to London at the Union of the Crowns in 1603. He slept in what is still known as \\"The King's Room\\".

Pinkie House West Face In 1694 the property passed to the Hays, the Marquess of Tweeddale adding a door to the east front. In 1745, following victory at the Battle of Prestonpans, Charles Edward Stuart, the \\"Young Pretender\\", stayed here, as well as using the building as a field hospital. In 1778 the Hays sold the building to Sir Archibald Hope, 9th Baronet Hope of Craighall, who made further alterations, and added a stable block. Extensions were carried out in 1825, designed by William Burn. In 1951 Pinkie House was bought by Loretto School, and altered again in the 1970s, with the addition of two other buildings in the grounds. An annexe has been built at the north side and the south wing now serves as the headmaster's house. The rest of Pinkie House now has a number of functions including a 6th-form boys' boarding house. Loretto pupils also sit their examinations in the painted gallery. Description right Pinkie House was originally an L-plan tower house, but extensions were added in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest part comprises a five- storey tower, to which Seton added bartizans and a crenellated parapet. This was attached to a strong three-storey main block with a pitched roof, again altered by Seton with square turrets. Inside there is a vaulted basement, and a wide turnpike stair up to the second storey. The interior has been modernised. Seton's main addition was the long three-storey south wing, which includes on its upper floor the 96-foot Painted Gallery. His mason may have been William Wallace, although this attribution is only stylistic.See McWilliam, p.336 On the south facade is a bay window, a feature new to Scotland in the early 17th century. The east fa√ßade is dominated by seven tall chimneys. There is a fine wooden ceiling, with classically inspired paintings in tempera, in the long gallery, as well as many 17th-century plaster ceilings. Another small painted ceiling was removed in 1951 and installed at the Huntly House museum in Edinburgh. Later interiors are by William Burn. A Latin inscription above the door states that \\"Alexander Seton built this house not to the measure of his desire, but of his fortunes and estate\\".Translated in McWilliam, p.336 A walled garden lies to the east of the house, with a shelter, doocot, and sundial. There is a Renaissance fountain or draw-well in the corner of the L, to the west of the house. This heavily ornamented structure was built around 1610.NMRS Site Reference NT37SW 4.01 Gallery File:401 LORETTO.jpgPinkie House now Loretto School File:Pinkie House02.jpgRenaissance fountain at Pinkie House File:Pinkie House04.jpgPinkie Tower File:Pinkie House07.jpgEntrance Lodge File:Pinkie House Doocot - geograph.org.uk - 166752.jpgDoocot (English 'Dovecote') at Pinkie House with Seton's characteristic cipher of a crowned crescent and cinquefoil over door to right File:'Margaret_Hay,_Countess_of_Dunfermline',_oil_on_canvas_painting_by_Marcus_Gheeraerts_the_Younger,_Dunedin_Public_Art_Gallery.JPGLady Lilias Drummond References * Coventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland, Goblinshead, 2001 * Fenwik, Hubert Scotland's Castles, Robert Hale Ltd, 1976 * Macnie, Donald Lamond The New Shell Guide to Scotland, Ebury Press, 1977 * McWilliam, Colin The Buildings of Scotland:Lothian, Penguin, 1978 * Sonia Baker The Country Houses, Castles and Mansions of East Lothian (2009) National Monuments Record of Scotland Site Reference NT37SW.4.0 External links *Loretto School: History of Pinkie House *RCAHMS Images on-line, including a photograph of the painted ceiling. *Gazetteer for Scotland: Pinkie House photograph page Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Category:Houses completed in the 17th century Category:Country houses in East Lothian Category:Category A listed buildings in East Lothian Category:Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Category:Musselburgh Category:William Wallace buildings Category:Tower houses in Scotland ","title":"Pinkie House"},{"id":"8877266","text":"Conasprella lucida is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.Bouchet, P.

The R-Zone was shown at the American International Toy Fair in February 1995, and was released later that year. The R-Zone was largely unsuccessful and would only be manufactured for a short period, before being discontinued in 1997. Although the R-Zone was not designed to compete directly with any other handhelds, it marked Tiger Electronics' first multi-game entry into the portable electronic game market. The original R-Zone unit consists of a headset and a separate controller containing batteries. Each game cartridge has its own transparent LCD display screen which is projected onto a mirrored surface held in front of the player's eye. It is thought that this original design, including the red color scheme, was designed to capitalize on popular buzz for the Nintendo Virtual Boy at the time. Three additional versions of the R-Zone were subsequently released: the R-Zone Super Screen, the X.P.G. Xtreme Pocket Game, and the R-Zone \\"DataZone\\". Games The game cartridges contained clear LCD screens that the R-Zone projected. R-Zone games vary only in title and subject; gameplay within the R-Zone's gaming library is almost identical from title to title. As with Tiger's other gaming units, the software lineup is dominated by licensed titles. Games released for the console include Batman Forever, Virtua Fighter, Mortal Kombat 3, VR Troopers, Indy 500, Star Wars, Men in Black, and The Lost World: Jurassic Park. This is a partial list: *Apollo 13 *Area 51 *Batman & Robin *Batman Forever *Battle Arena Toshinden *Daytona Racing *Independence Day *Indy 500 *Judge Dredd *The Lost World: Jurassic Park *Men in Black *Mortal Kombat 3 *Mortal Kombat Trilogy *NASCAR Racing *Panzer Dragoon *Primal Rage *Road Rash 3 *Star Trek *Star Wars: Imperial Assault *Star Wars: Jedi Adventure *Star Wars: Millennium Falcon Challenge *Star Wars: Rebel Forces *Virtua Cop *Virtua Fighter *Virtua Fighter 2 *VR Troopers: When Worlds Collide Hardware The R-Zone has ten face buttons. The buttons on the right are labeled \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\". The functions of these face buttons vary from game to game but typically the buttons correspond to a four- direction attack scheme (where the \\"C\\" button attacks to the left, the \\"D\\" button attacks up, the \\"B\\" button attacks right, and the \\"A\\" button attacks down or does nothing at all. The buttons on the bottom are labeled \\"ON\\", \\"START\\", \\"SELECT\\", \\"SOUND\\", \\"PAUSE\\", and \\"OFF\\". The functions of these face buttons are universal and do not vary from game-to-game. The \\"ON\\" button simply turns on the console but is largely un-used as inserting a game cartridge automatically turns the unit on. The \\"START\\" button is required to begin all games. The \\"SOUND\\" button toggles the audio on and off. The \\"PAUSE\\" button allows for any game to be paused. The \\"OFF\\" button turns the console off. The R-Zone also features a directional pad, allowing four directions of movement in its games. The R-Zone X.P.G. (Xtreme Pocket Game) model The R-Zone game cartridges are transparent in the center. This allows light to pass through and reflect off a specialized mirror to the gamer's eyes. The LCD in each cartridge operates identically to Tiger's earlier handheld LCD game units. All of the graphics were pre-drawn and permanently set into the LCD itself. Different portions of the display are darkened/activated at different times to provide animation. The mirror has minor tilt adjustment and can be pushed up against the unit for protection and storage. The games only display a dark red color. The bottom side of the console shows two ports (one on the left side, the other on the right). Each port is accessible with a screwdriver and holds the batteries. A single speaker allows for mono audio output. Variations A few variations of the R-Zone were produced: The R-Zone SuperScreen model, which used lighted rear-projection. *The R-Zone Headgear was released in late 1995 and is largely different from later units in that the game cartridge is inserted into a device that is strapped onto the user's head. The user flips down a transparent lens that was designed to reflect the game images into the user's right eye. The head unit holds the game being played and is connected to a controller with a cable approximately long. The controller requires 4 AAA batteries and sports a cartridge storage slot (for keeping an additional game protected and available), volume adjustment dial, and brightness adjustment dial. The console was priced $29.99 at launch and included a pack-in game. *The R-Zone Super Screen was released in late 1996 and initially cost $29.99. It allowed R-Zone games to have color for the first time. Some games allow for a special lens to be used with this particular R-Zone and simply provide the user with a non-animated color background. Game movement on screen is black. The screen is considerably larger than the other R-Zone models; because of this, and the fact that the user is not required to look at a mirror at a precise angle to see the gameplay, other people can also see gameplay. The unit changed the layout again and requires 4 D batteries to run. In this model the D-pad was swapped out for four directional buttons (up, down, left, and right). * \\"X.P.G. Xtreme Pocket Game\\" (1997) is a completely handheld version of the console. It lacks a headset, and instead projects the display onto a mirrored surface directly above the game controller area on the unit. This version also uses AAA batteries. * The R-Zone DataZone was released in late 1996. It is another handheld version of the console, but includes a data organizer. It no longer projects the image through a mirror but rather just flat displays it with a backlight. It uses one watch battery to store data and 2 AAA batteries to run the game portion. Reception At the time of its release, David Jones of the Chicago Tribune called the R-Zone \\"a waste of time and money\\" and wrote that its screen \\"is hard to see and the controls are very awkward. That's not all ‚Äì if you keep the head band on for, say, five minutes, you'll have two deep lines on your fore-head and a headache\\". Jones noted the failure of the R-Zone's extra head-band padding ‚Äì which was designed to prevent pain ‚Äì and concluded, \\"The R-Zone should be dumped into the trash can where it belongs\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly remarked that while the display takes time to get used to and is not \\"even in the same league as the Virtual Boy's immersive experience,\\" the R-Zone is much less expensive and, unlike the Virtual Boy, is functionally portable. In 2008, Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar+ included the R-Zone on a list of the 10 worst game consoles released up to that time. Reparaz considered the R-Zone to be a poor version of Nintendo's Virtual Boy and stated that it was essentially \\"just a gimmicky version of the same awful, clicky-beepy LCD games that Tiger had been dumping on the market since the '80s.\\" In 2016, Motherboard called the R-Zone, \\"Perhaps the most infamous product ever associated with Tiger\\", stating that the console's games \\"were glorified versions\\" of Tiger's LCD games. Motherboard stated that the R-Zone was similar to the Virtual Boy in some ways, but considered the R-Zone to be \\"much, much worse\\".

It is a specific form of cultural assimilation that often includes language assimilation. The term applies not only to cultures but also to individuals, as they acclimate to Persian culture and become \\"Persianized\\" or \\"Persified\\". Historically, the term was commonly applied to changes in the culture of non- Iranian peoples living within the Persian cultural sphere, especially during the early and the middle Islamic periods such as Arabs and various South Caucasus (such as Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani) and Turkic peoples including the Seljuqs, Ottomans and Ghaznavids.Bhatia, Tej K., The handbook of bilingualism, (2004), p.788-9Ravandi, M., The Seljuq court at Konya and the Persianisation of Anatolian Cities, in Mesogeios (Mediterranean Studies), vol. 25-6 (2005) , pp157-69 The term has also been applied to the transmission of aspects of Persian culture, including language, to the non-Persian peoples in area surrounding Persia (Iran), such as Anatolia and South Asia. History =Pre-Islamic Period= Unlike the Ancient Greeks and the Roman Empire, the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire was not concerned with spreading its culture to the many peoples that it conquered. Arguably, the first recorded episode of persianization dates back to Alexander the Great, who, after conquering the Persian Empire in the 4th century BCE, adopted Persian dress, customs and court mannerisms; married a Persian princess, Stateira II and made subjects cast themselves on their faces when approaching him, in Persian-style, known to Greeks as the custom of proskynesis, a symbolic kissing of the hand that Persians paid to their social superiors. Persian dress and practices were also observed by Peucestas, who was later made satrap of Persis, where he conciliated the favour of the Persians to his rule in exchange for those of the Macedonians.Arrian, vii. 23, 24, 26; Photius, Bibliotheca, cod. 82, cod. 92; Diodorus, xvii. 110, xviii. 3, 39; Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, xiii. 4 =Early Islamic Period to 15th century= After the fall of the Sasanian dynasty in 651, the Umayyad Arabs adopted many of the Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were either persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly, Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century,Hawting G., The First Dynasty of Islam. The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750, (London) 1986, pp. 63-64 when, in 692, minting began at the caliphal capital, Damascus. The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian and Byzantine coins, and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic. The Abbasids, after 750, established their capital in what is now Iraq, eventually at Baghdad. A shift in orientation toward the east is discernible, which was encouraged by increased receptiveness to Persian cultural influence and the roots of the Abbasid revolution in Khorasan, now in AfghanistanKennedy H., The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, London, 1986, pp. 134-37 A proverb complained about the Persianization of morals by Turks. =16th to 18th centuries= Two major powers in West Asia rose, the Persian Safavids and Ottoman Turks. The Safavids reasserted Persian culture and hegemony over South Caucasus, Eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia and other regions. Many khans, begs and other rulers adopted Persian customs and clothing and patronized Persian culture. They founded the city of Derbent in the North Caucasus (now in Dagestan, Russia). Many ethnic peoples adopted many aspects of Persian culture and contributed to their persianization. At the same time, the Ottomans and their predecessors, the various Beylerbergs and the Sultanate of Rum, patronized so heavily of Persian culture that they became fully Persianate. The Ottomans, for example, adopted Persian names; made Persian an official and prestigious language; adopted Persian titles; adopted Persian cuisine, dances, and literature and added many Persian words to their own language. =Modern times= In modern times, the term is often used in connection with non-Persian speakers like the Azeri and the Kurds.Margaret K., The official Persianization of Kurdish, Paper presented at the Eighth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, Leeds, England, (August 1975). It has been argued that modern Iranian nationalism was established during the Pahlavi era and was based on the aim of forming a modern nation-state. What is often neglected is that Iranian nationalism has its roots before the Pahlavi, in the early 20th century. On the eve of World War I, Pan-Turkist propaganda focused on the Turkic-speaking lands of Iran, the Caucasus and Central Asia.Touraj Atabaki, \\"Recasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan-Turkism and Iranian Nationalism\\" in Van Schendel, Willem (Editor). Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London, GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001: The ultimate purpose of persuading these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and to join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies emanating from modern Turkey and threatening Iran's territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoptions of this integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group's cultural nationalism. According to Tadeusz Swietochowski, in 1930s, the term was used to describe the official policy pursued by Reza Shah Pahlavi to assimilate the ethnic minorities in Iran (Iranians as well as Non- Iranians). In particular, within this policy the Azerbaijani language was banned for use on the premises of schools, in theatrical performances, religious ceremonies and in the publication of books. Swietochowski writes: Mughal Empire The Mughal Empire was an Islamic imperial power that ruled a large portion of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan in South Asia. From 1526, the Moguls invaded the Indian Subcontinent, from their initial base in Kabul, and they eventually ruled most of Hindustan (South Asia) by the late 17th and the early 18th centuries until the mid-19th century. The emperors were descendants of the Timurids who had embraced Persian culture, converted to Islam and resided in Turkestan, and they were the ones responsible for the spread of Persian and Islamic culture to Central Asia. At the height of their power around 1700, they controlled most of the Indian Subcontinent and Afghanistan and spread Persian culture throughout, just as their predecessors the Turkic Ghaznavids and the Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate had done. In general, from its earliest days, Persian culture and language was spread in South Asia by various Persianised Central Asian Turkic and Afghan dynasties.Sigfried J. de Laet. History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century UNESCO, 1994. p 734 Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, identified his lineage as Timurid and Chaghatay-Turkic, and his origin, milieu, training and culture were Persian culture. He was largely responsible for the fostering of the culture by his descendants and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian Subcontinent (and Afghanistan), with brilliant literary, artistic and historiographical results. Many works of art such as the Taj Mahal, Humayun's Tomb and the Badshahi Mosque are of Persian Islamic architecture, with Persian names. Persian was the official language of the Mughal courts, until replaced with Urdu by the British. Afghanistan By 1964, the Afghanistan Constitution cited Dari as one of its two official languages alongside Pashto. Although the latter is the designated national language, Dari remains the lingua franca. There are modern initiatives that attempt to \\"Pashto-ize\\" all governmental communication. Since Dari is the language of the bureaucracy, Persian-speaking Afghans dominated it. Persianization is especially seen in the case of the \\"Kabulis\\", the long- established families from Kabul (usually Pashtuns completely immersed in Persian culture). Persianization is also reinforced by the incidence of urbanization in the country, which influenced the characteristics of the Afghan ethnic groups. The two most significant ethnic groups in Afghanistan are the Pashtuns, who are speakers of the Pashto language, and the Tajiks, who are Persian speakers. While Pashtuns dominated the country since they constitute the majority of the Afghan population, Persian culture still permeated. In the early history of Afghanistan as an independent country, many Pashtuns moved into urbanized areas and adopted Dari as their language. As a result, many ethnic Pashtuns in Afghanistan identify themselves as Tajiks but still have Pashtun names (such as a last name with the suffix \\"-zai\\") simply because they speak Dari and are assimilated into Tajiki culture in the country within a process known as \\"de-tribalization\\".

He is probably best known for the much- anthologised story \\"His Unconquerable Enemy\\" (1889), about the implacable revenge of a servant whose limbs have been amputated on the orders of a cruel rajah. Biography Morrow's father was a Baptist minister and the owner of a farm and of a hotel in Mobile, Alabama. The American Civil War meant that the family lost its slaves and by 1876 the young Morrow was running the hotel, having graduated from Howard College (now Samford University) in Birmingham at the age of fifteen. Morrow moved west to California in 1879 and began selling stories to The Argonaut, where Ambrose Bierce was just terminating a two-year period of employment. Bierce was an enthusiast of Morrow's stories (in one of his squibs, a nervous reader declares, \\"I have one of Will Morrow's tales in my pocket, but I don't dare to go where there is light enough to read it\\"Bierce, The Unabridged Devil's Dictionary, ed. David E. Schultz & S. T. Joshi, p.218.), and in 1887 probably recommended William Randolph Hearst to approach Morrow for material for the San Francisco Examiner. Several of Morrow's most notable tales appeared in this newspaper. Morrow married Lydia E. Houghton in 1881. They had one child, which was either stillborn or died in infancy. His first novel, Blood-Money (1882), about the Mussel Slough Tragedy, was an indictment of the conduct of California railroad companies which were forcing settlers off their land. It gained little attention, and in fact Morrow took a position in the public relations department of the Southern Pacific Railroad some nine years later. A mystery/suspense novel, A Strange Confession, was serialized in the Californian in 1880-81, but was never published in book form. His stories were collected in The Ape, the Idiot and Other People in 1897, but he published few stories thereafter. The book is now a much sought-after collectors' item. By 1899 Morrow had begun a school for writers, and in 1901 he produced a pamphlet, The Art of Writing for Publication. Bierce commented that: :\\"it is a pity Morrow teaches others to write badly instead of himself writing well. But I fancy we have no grievance therein, or if we have it is against the pig public, not against Morrow. He would write books, doubtless, if he could afford to, as I would do.\\"Letter to Herman Scheffauer, 7 September 1903. Quoted S. T. Joshi, The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004), p. 16. Morrow published two romantic adventure novels, A Man; His Mark (1900) and Lentala of the South Seas (1908); an apparently journalistic work called Bohemian Paris of Today, from \\"notes by Edouard Cucuel\\", and a short travel booklet, Roads Around Paso Robles (1904). A critical essay on Morrow's work can be found in S. T. Joshi's book The Evolution of the Weird Tale (2004), from which the above information is taken.

In his career as a professional motorcycle racer has won the 1998 AMA 250GP National Champion road racer championship. Sands is an award-winning designer of custom performance motorcycles, and owner and founder of Roland Sands Design.  Background  Roland Sands painting helmets at the Bell Helmets booth at the 2012 Seattle International Motorcycle Show. Sands is from Long Beach, California. He began his life with the upbringing and diverse experience in the motorcycle industry. His first motorcycle was a Suzuki RM 50 dirt bike, given to him on his 5th birthday, on which, after just minutes of riding, he broke a bone, but fell in love with it anyway. He literally grew up in the Performance Machine shop, and started working there at age 14 sweeping floors. Quickly moving up to assembly, sanding polishing, wheel designing, eventually working his way as Director of R&D; and Design at Performance Machine. In 2005, after the tremendous success Sands found on Discovery Channel's Biker Build-Off vs. Arlen Ness, Sands founded Roland Sands Design. RSD designs concept motorcycle parts and accessories and builds custom motorcycles. RSD works with major motorcycle manufacturers to design concept and prototype motorcycles and promote benchmark product in the motorcycle industry and beyond. Sands‚Äô designs are described as being a mixture of sport bike and chopper influences to create the ultimate custom bikes.  Pro racing career  During Sands‚Äô professional racing career, from 1994 to 2002, Sands gained 10 wins to his reputation. At the age of 19, Sands‚Äô father sent him to Keith Code‚Äôs California Superbike School, and from that day on, road racing became his passion. His first race bike was a Yamaha TZ250, a purpose-built, two stroke racing machine. Winning his first novice 250GP race at Willow Springs Raceway in California, Sands enjoyed a nine-year professional racing career at the top of the AMA 250GP ranks, including a national championship in 1998. In 2000, after winning a few races stateside, Sands did a stint in the British Super Cup series on a factory Honda. Sands still currently holds four track records including Daytona, Sears Point, and Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. Although enjoying his racing career, bodily injuries caused by racing accidents were taking the best of his competitive drive. Sands decided to broaden his career in custom motorcycle design and building, in which he had already mechanical and fabrication skills from building race bikes during his racing years. In 2004, designer Chip Foose awarded Sands with the Award of Design Excellence for his design on the motorcycle 'The Hard Way'. In 2005, he was honored by his peers, who voted him Rookie of the Year on the Discovery Channel Biker Build-Off award show. Since his first television appearance on Biker Build-Off, he‚Äôs been featured on ESPN2‚Äôs Chopper Nation and Super Bikes, Speed Channel's American Thunder and Build or Bust, and crowned champion of Biker Build-Off in 2006 against Jesse Rooke.

The river is long, drains a watershed of approximately , and passes through Wakefield, Lynnfield, Saugus, and Lynn as it meanders east and south from its source in Lake Quannapowitt in Wakefield (elevation 90 feet) to its mouth in Broad Sound. It has at least eight tributaries: the Mill River; Bennets Pond Brook; the Pines River; Hawkes Brook; Crystal Pond Brook; Beaver Dam Brook; Strawberry Brook; and Shute Brook. Although Native Americans called the river Aboutsett (\\"winding stream\\"), European settlers first called it the River at Saugus, where Saugus (possibly a native word for \\"long\\") arguably named the beach running from Swampscott to Revere (there are competing theories as to the origin of the word \\"Saugus\\"). In early European times, alewives and bass were harvested from 1632 onwards. The Saugus Iron Works used water power from the river in by 1642, and the river subsequently attracted grist mills, chocolate mills, wool and flannel mills, and a tannery.

In an aide-m√©moire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding. As Adolf Hitler's occupation swept across Europe, neutral Portugal became one of Europe's last escape routes. Portugal was able to maintain its neutrality until 1944, when a military agreement was signed to give the United States permission to establish a military base in Santa Maria in Azores and thus its status changed to non-belligerent in favor of the Allies.  Overview  At the outbreak of World War II, Portugal was ruled by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, the man who in 1933 had founded the Estado Novo (\\"New State\\"), the corporatist authoritarian government that ruled Portugal until 1974. He had favoured the Spanish nationalist cause, fearing a communist invasion of Portugal, yet he was uneasy at the prospect of a Spanish government bolstered by strong ties with the Axis. Salazar's policy of neutrality for Portugal in World War II thus included a strategic component. The country still held overseas territories that, because of their poor economic development, could not adequately defend themselves from military attack. Since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, the country expected to remain neutral. In an aide-m√©moire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding and Portugal remained neutral during the entire war. On 15 May 1940, Salazar's important role in the war was recognised by the British: Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed Salazar that the University's Hebdomadal Council had \\"unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you [Salazar] to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law\\". Salazar's decision to stick with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance allowed the Portuguese Island of Madeira to come to the aid of the Allies and in July 1940 around 2,500 evacuees from Gibraltar were shipped to Madeira. At the same time Life magazine, in a long article titled: \\"Portugal: The War Has Made It Europe's Front\\", called Salazar \\"a benevolent ruler\\", described him as \\"by far the world's best dictator, he [Salazar] is also the greatest Portuguese since Prince Henry the Navigator\\", and added that \\"the dictator has built the nation\\". Life declared that \\"most of what is good in modern Portugal can be credited to Dr. Antonio de Oliveira Salazar (...) The dictator is everything that most Portuguese are not ‚Äì calm, silent, ascetic, puritanical, a glutton for work, cool to women. He found a country in chaos and poverty. He has balanced the budget, built roads and schools, torn down slums, cut the death rate and enormously raised Portuguese self-esteem.\\" In September 1940, Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar congratulating him on his ability to keep Portugal out of the war, asserting that \\"as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question.\\" Despite Portuguese neutrality, in December 1941, Portuguese Timor was occupied by Australian and Dutch forces, which were expecting a Japanese invasion. Salazar's reaction was violent. He protested, saying that the Allies had violated Portuguese sovereignty and jeopardised Portuguese neutrality. A strong Portuguese garrison force (about 800 men) was then sent from East Africa to take over the defence of east Timor but did not arrive on time; on 20 February 1942 the Japanese began landing troops in Timor.  Azores  Location of the Portuguese Azores Islands Portugal managed to remain neutral despite extraordinary pressures from both sides. Both the Allies and the Axis sought to control the strategically located Azores islands during World War II. Salazar was especially worried about a possible German invasion through Spain and did not want to provoke Hitler; nor did he want to give Spain an excuse to take side with the Axis and invade Portugal due to the strategic importance of the Canary Islands. Both Great Britain and the United States devised several plans to set up air bases in the Azores regardless of Portugal's disapproval. The plans were never put into operation. In 1942 Lajes Field on the Azores was assigned the name Air Base No. 4 and the Portuguese government expanded the runway and sent troops and equipment to Lajes, including Gloster Gladiator fighters. Military activity in the Azores grew as the Gladiators' role progressed into flying cover for Allied convoys, reconnaissance missions and meteorological flights. In August 1943, Portugal signed the Luso-British agreement, which leased bases in the Azores to the British. This was a key turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic, allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the Mid- Atlantic gap; helping them to hunt U-boats and protect convoys. Churchill surprised members of parliament (MPs) when he said he would use a 14th-century treaty; many MPs had not known that Portugal and England had the oldest operational alliance in the world, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373. Churchill ended his speech saying: ::I take this opportunity of placing on record the appreciation by His Majesty's Government, which I have no doubt is shared by Parliament and the British nation, of the attitude of the Portuguese Government, whose loyalty to their British Ally never wavered in the darkest hours of the war. Aƒ£reement With Portuƒ£al HC Deb 12 October 1943 vol 392 cc716-9 A few months later, on 1 December 1943, British and U.S. military representatives at RAF Lajes signed a joint agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and United States Navy (USN) at Lajes Field. The agreement established guidelines and limitations for the US to ferry and transport aircraft to Europe via Lajes Field. In return, the US agreed to assist the British in improving and extending existing facilities at Lajes. Air Transport Command transport planes began landing at Lajes Field immediately after the agreement was signed. In 1944, Portugal signed an agreement with the United States allowing the use of military facilities in the Azores. American forces constructed a small and short-lived air base on Santa Maria Island. By the end of June 1944 more than 1,900 American aircraft had passed through Lajes Air Base. Using Lajes, the flying time relative to the usual transatlantic route between Brazil and West Africa was cut nearly in half from 70 to 40 hours. Lajes also served as one of two main stopover and refuelling bases for the first transatlantic crossing of non-rigid airships (blimps) in 1944. The US Navy sent six Goodyear-built K-ships from Naval Air Station South Weymouth in Massachusetts to their first stopover base at Naval Station Argentia Newfoundland and then on to Lajes Field in the Azores before flying to their final destination at Port Lyautey, French Morocco.https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/fbd712_4eac320cdad44dd68701e9cecad8e446.pdf From their base with Fleet Air Wing 15 at Port Lyautey, the blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14) conducted night time anti-submarine warfare (ASW), surveillance of German U-boats around the Straits of Gibraltar using magnetic anomaly detection (MAD). In 1945, two ZP-14 replacement blimps were sent from Weeksville, North Carolina to the Bermudas and Lajes Air Base before going on to Port Lyautey. In 1945, a new air base was constructed in the Azores on the island of Terceira and is currently known as Lajes Field. This base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This Air Force base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support United States and Portuguese military operations. During the Cold War, the United States Navy's P-3 Orion anti- submarine squadrons patrolled the North Atlantic for Soviet submarines and surface spy vessels.  Wolfram  Portugal allowed Great Britain to trade and receive credit backed by the pound, allowing the British to obtain vital goods at a time when it was short on gold and escudos and all other neutrals were prepared to trade their currencies only against gold. By 1945 the British owed Portugal over $322 million under this arrangement. Another delicate issue was the wolfram (or tungsten) trade. Following the invasion of the Soviet Union, Germany became dependent on Portugal and Spain for its wolfram supplies. Wolfram was of particular value in producing war munitions. To maintain its neutrality, Portugal set up a strict export quota system in 1942. This concept of neutrality through equal division of products supplied to belligerents was different from that of the Northern European neutrals who worked on the basis of \\"normal pre-war supplies\\". But in January 1944, the Allies began to pressure Salazar to embargo all wolfram sales to Germany. Portugal resisted, defending its right as a neutral to sell to anyone and fearing that any reduction in its exports would prompt Germany to attack Portuguese shipping. Salazar's fears were not groundless as, despite Portuguese neutrality, the steamer Ganda was torpedoed and sunk by the Germans in June 1941. On 12 October 1941 the neutral ship Corte Real was stopped for inspection by U-83 80 miles west of Lisbon. The U-boat opened fire with the deck gun, setting the ship on fire and finally sinking her with two torpedoes. On 14 December 1941 the unescorted and neutral Cassequel was hit in the stern by one of two torpedoes from U-boat-108 about 160 miles southwest of Cape St. Vincent, Portugal, and sank immediately. The Serpa Pinto was also stopped and boarded in 1944 (26 May) in the mid-Atlantic by the German submarine U-541, but the ship was ultimately allowed to proceed after the German naval authorities declined to approve its sinking. On 5 June 1944, just before the Normandy invasion, following the threats of economic sanctions by the Allies, the Portuguese government opted for a complete embargo on wolfram exports to both the Allies and the Axis, thereby putting 100,000 Portuguese labourers out of work.  Portugal's role in keeping Spain neutral  Just a few days before the end of the Spanish Civil War, on 17 March 1939, Portugal and Spain signed the Iberian Pact, a non-aggression treaty that marked the beginning of a new phase in Iberian relations. Meetings between Franco and Salazar played a fundamental role in this new political arrangement. An additional protocol to the pact was signed on 29 July 1940, after the fall of France.Maria In√°cia Rezola, \\"The Franco‚ÄìSalazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the Dictatorships (1942‚Äì1963)\\" E-Journal of Portuguese History (2008) 6#2 pp. 1‚Äì11. online The pact proved to be a decisive instrument in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system. In November 1943, Sir Ronald Campbell, the British ambassador in Lisbon, wrote: > strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits > accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of > being strict had been more benevolent in allies' favour Spain would > inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If > this had happened the peninsula would have been occupied and then North > Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been > altered to the advantage of the Axis. The British diplomat Sir George Rendell stated that the Portuguese Republican Government of Bernardino Machado was \\"far more difficult to deal with as an ally during the First War than the infinitely better Government of Salazar was as a neutral in the Second.\\" A similar opinion is shared by Carlton Hayes, the American Ambassador in Spain during World War II, who writes in his book Wartime Mission in Spain: > [Salazar] didn't look like a regular dictator. Rather, he appeared a modest, > quiet, and highly intelligent gentleman and scholar...literally dragged from > a professorial chair of political economy in the venerable University of > Coimbra a dozen years previously in order to straighten out Portugal's > finances, and that his almost miraculous success in this respect had led to > the thrusting upon him of other major functions, including those of foreign > minister and constitution-maker. Hayes is very appreciative of Portugal's constant endeavours to draw Spain with Portugal into a genuinely neutral peninsular bloc, an immeasurable contribution, at a time when the British and the United States had much less influence, toward counteracting the propaganda and pleas of the Axis.  Haven for refugees  The number of refugees that escaped through Portugal during the war has estimates that range from one hundred thousand to one million; an impressive number considering the size of the country's population at that time (circa 6 million).Neil Lochery estimates a high end number of one million. See Lochery, Neill. \\"Lisbon: War in the Shadows of the City of Light, 1939‚Äì45\\", Public Affairs; 1 edition (1 November 2011), \\"In 1940 Lisbon, happiness was staged so that God could believe it still existed,\\" wrote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry.Saint-Exupery escaped from France to Portugal and ended up in Lisbon, waiting for a visa to go to America. The Portuguese capital became a symbol of hope for many refugees. Even Ilsa and Rick, the star-crossed lovers in the film Casablanca, sought a ticket to that \\"great embarkation point\\". Thousands flooded the city trying to obtain the documents necessary to escape to the United States or Palestine. Not all found their way. On 26 June 1940, four days after France's armistice with Germany, Salazar authorised the main Office of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ( HIAS- HICEM) in Paris to be transferred to Lisbon. According to the Lisbon Jewish community, Salazar held Mois√©s Bensabat Amzalak, the leader of the Lisbon Jewish community, in high esteem, allowing Amzalak to play an important role in getting Salazar's permission for the transfer. Memorial commemorating Gibraltarian evacuees in Madeira In July 1940, the civilian population of Gibraltar was evacuated due to expected attacks expected from Germany and Italy. At that time, Portuguese Madeira agreed to host about 2,500 Gibraltarian evacuees, mostly women and children, who arrived at Funchal between 21 July and 13 August 1940 and who remained there until the end of the war. In 2010 a monument was commissioned in Gibraltar and shipped to Madeira where it was erected next to a small chapel at Santa Catarina park, Funchal. The monument was a gift and a symbol of ever-lasting appreciation from the people of Gibraltar to the people of Madeira.www.love-madeira.com (accessed 13 December 2010) The Portuguese consul general in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, helped an undetermined number of refugees, and his actions were not unique by any means. Issuing visas in contravention of instructions was widespread at Portuguese consulates all over Europe, although some cases were directly supported by Salazar. The Portuguese Ambassador in Budapest, Carlos Sampaio Garrido, helped an estimated 1,000 Hungarian Jews in 1944. Along with Carlos de Liz-Texeira Branquinho, under Salazar's direct guidance, they rented houses and apartments to shelter and protect refugees from deportation and murder. On 28 April 1944, the Hungarian Gestapo raided the ambassador's home and arrested his guests. The ambassador, who physically resisted the police, was also arrested, but managed to have his guests released on the grounds of extraterritoriality of diplomatic legations. In 2010, Garrido was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Other Portuguese who deserve credit for saving Jews during the war include Professor Francisco Paula Leite Pinto and Mois√©s Bensabat Amzalak. A devoted Jew and a supporter of Salazar, Amzalak headed the Lisbon Jewish community for 52 years, from 1926 until 1978. Historian Carlton Hayes, the American Ambassador in Spain during the war, writes of a \\"prodigious number of refugees\\", who began pouring into Spain in November and December 1942. Most were Frenchmen, half starved, without money or clothes, and Hayes writes of the decisive intervention of the Ambassador Pedro Teot√≥nio Pereira in favour of 16,000 refugees of French military refugees who were trying in 1943 to get from Spain to North Africa in order there to join the Allied forces. In that group were also included Polish, Dutch and Belgians, most of whom were soldiers or would-be soldiers. According to Hayes the Poles in particular were destined to perform brilliant feats in the later Italian campaign.  Portuguese volunteers fighting the Soviet Union on the Axis side  After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, recruits from France, Spain, Belgium (including Walloons), the territory of occupied Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Balkans signed on. The foreigners who served in the Waffen-SS numbered \\"some 500,000\\", including those who were pressured into or conscripted. An estimated number of 159 Portuguese volunteers fought for the Axis in the World War II, mainly in the Spanish Blue Division. They were mostly veteran volunteers of the Spanish civil war, the so-called Viriatos and were essentially adventurous mercenaries or Portuguese fascist nationalists fighting the communist and Bolshevik threat. Portugal and the Pacific War Japanese-held territory and Portuguese and other colonial possessions in the Pacific as of 1939 =Macau= Portugal was also neutral during the Pacific War. Its colony of Macau was isolated following the Japanese conquest of nearby areas of China and the fall of Hong Kong in December 1941. This led to food shortages for the remainder of the war which contributed to high rates of death from disease. While Japan did not invade Macau, its forces attacked a British merchant ship anchored off the colony in August 1943 and killed 20 members of its crew. The government of Macau was subsequently forced to accept the presence of Japanese \\"advisers\\", recognise Japanese authority in southern China and withdraw the colony's garrison from several bases. In addition, Macau's government traded some of the colony's defensive guns for food and agreed to sell supplies of aviation fuel to Japan in early 1945. On 16 January 1945 US Navy aircraft attacked Macau as part of the South China Sea raid. The main targets were the aviation fuel stores, which the Allies had learned were to be sold, and a radio station in or near the fort of Dona Maria II. In addition, urban areas and the colony's harbour were damaged. American aircraft also accidentally attacked Macau on 25 February and 11 June 1945. Following the war the US Government paid compensation for the damage to Macau's harbour. = East Timor = The East Timorese village of Mindelo (Turiscai) is burnt to the ground by Australian guerrillas to prevent its use as a Japanese base, 12 December 1942 On 17 December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dutch and Australian troops disembarked at Portuguese Timor, in violation of Portuguese sovereignty. Salazar denounced the allied operation as an invasion of a neutral territory. On 20 February 1942, alleging self-defence, Japan invaded the island of Timor.  Goa  From December 1942, German merchant ships which had sought refuge in the territory of Goa in Portuguese India in 1939 began providing regular intelligence on Allied shipping via radio to German U-boats of the Monsun Gruppe operating in the Indian Ocean. Once the British discovered this, the Special Operations Executive launched Operation Creek, using a group of part-time soldiers called the Calcutta Light Horse to infiltrate the harbour and sink the German ship Ehrenfels with limpet mines, ending the transmissions. Due to the violation of Portuguese neutrality, the operation was kept secret until 1978.  Military operations that threatened Portuguese neutrality  = By the Axis =  Operation Felix  The Germans had planned an attack on Gibraltar, codenamed Operation Felix, which was never initiated. It included the potential invasion of Portugal if the British gained a foothold and considered the occupation of Madeira and of the Azores.Escuadra, Alfonso and others,Operation Felix (Section: The German assault plan), www.discovergibraltar.com  F√ºhrer Directive No. 18  On 12 November 1940 Hitler issued F√ºhrer Directive No. 18, which outlined the plan to invade Portugal if British forces were to gain a footing there. \\"I also request that the problem of occupying Madeira and the Azores should be considered, together with the advantages and disadvantages which this would entail for our sea and air warfare. The results of these investigations are to be submitted to me as soon as possible,\\" Hitler added.  Operation Isabella  In June 1941, Operation Isabella was a Nazi German plan to be put into effect after the collapse of the Soviet Union to secure bases in Spain and Portugal for the continuation of the strangulation of Great Britain. This concept was laid out by Hitler, but was never executed. = By the Allies =  Operation Alacrity  Operation Alacrity was the codename for a proposed Allied seizure of the Azores during World War II. The islands were of enormous strategic value with regard to the defeat of the German U-boats. Salazar was especially worried about a possible German invasion through Spain and did not want to provoke Hitler; nor did he want to give Spain an excuse to take sides with the Axis and invade Portugal due to the strategic importance of the Canary Islands. Great Britain and the United States devised plans to set up air bases regardless of Portugal's disapproval. The plans were never put into operation. Instead in 1943 Britain requested, and Portugal agreed, to allow Britain to set up bases there. Operation Alacrity was preceded by War Plan Gray.  War Plan Gray  War Plan Gray was a plan for the United States to invade the Azores Islands in 1940‚Äì41. Gray is one of the many color- coded war plans created in the early 20th century. On 22 May 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the U.S. Army and Navy to draft an official plan to occupy the Portuguese Azores. Approved by the Joint Board on 29 May, War Plan Gray called for a landing force of 28,000 troops, one half Marine and one half Army.  Espionage  Several American reports called Lisbon \\"The Capital of Espionage\\". However, the PIDE (Portuguese secret police) always maintained a neutral stance towards foreign espionage activity, as long as there was no intervention in Portuguese internal policies. Writers such as Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond) were based there, while other prominent people such as the Duke of Windsor and the Spanish royal family were exiled in Estoril. German spies attempted to buy information on trans-Atlantic shipping to help their submarines fight the Battle of the Atlantic. The Spaniard Juan Pujol Garc√≠a, better known as Codename Garbo, passed on misinformation to the Germans, hoping it would hasten the end of the Franco regime; he was recruited by the British as a double agent while in Lisbon. Conversely, William Colepaugh, an American traitor, was recruited as an agent by the Germans while his ship was in port in Lisbon ‚Äì he was subsequently landed by U-boat in Maine before being captured. In 1941 John Beevor, the head of Special Operations Executive (SOE) in Lisbon, established an underground network with the aim of carrying out sabotage tasks in the event of a German and/or Spanish invasion of Portugal. The targets for immediate destruction were oil refineries, railroads, bridges and industrial and mining facilities. The Portuguese police discovered that Beevor's network included several \\"anti-Salazar\\" Portuguese members, which irked the Portuguese authorities. Salazar suspected that British flirtation with his opponents could be hiding an attempt to install in Lisbon a \\"democratic\\" alternative to his regime, one willing to bring the country under British patronage. Salazar informed the British Ambassador that he wanted heads to roll and ended up requesting Beevor's withdrawal. Despite the incident Captain Agostinho Louren√ßo, the founder and first head of Portugal's security and immigration police, earned a reputation with British observers, recorded in a confidential print generated at the British Embassy, which suggested a \\"pro-British\\" bias on his part. Louren√ßo always kept a good relationship with the MI6 which allowed him later in 1956 to become the head of international police organisation, Interpol. In June 1943, a commercial airliner carrying the actor Leslie Howard was shot down over the Bay of Biscay by the Luftwaffe after taking off from Lisbon. Aftermath Teot√≥nio Pereira standing behind. Salazar stood doggedly by his \\"juridical neutrality\\" to the end of the War. On the death of Hitler, he followed the protocol and ordered flags to be flown at half mast. Salazar also allowed German Ambassador Hoyningen-Huene to settle permanently in the Lisbon area, where he lived out part of his retirement. Portugal continued to welcome refugees after the war. Umberto II, the King of Italy, lived for 37 years in exile, in Cascais. The Count and Countess of Barcelona, the heir-apparent to the defunct Spanish throne D. Juan de Bourbon and his wife D. Maria de las Mercedes, were exiled in Estoril, Cascais on 2 February 1946. Later, in April, they were joined by their children Pilar, Juan Carlos (the future King Juan Carlos of Spain), Margarita and Alfonso. Calouste Gulbenkian, the Armenian oil magnate known as \\"Mr. Five Percent\\", also chose Portugal as a place to settle. In an operation organised by Caritas Portugal from 1947 to 1952, 5,500 Austrian children, most of them orphans, were transported by train from Vienna to Lisbon and then placed in the foster care of Portuguese families. Portugal survived the horrors of war not only physically intact but significantly wealthier. To commemorate the fact that it was spared the destruction of the war, in 1959 the Cristo Rei monument was built in Almada, overlooking Lisbon. Despite the authoritarian character of the regime Portugal did not experience the same levels of international isolation as Francoist Spain did following World War II. Unlike Spain, Portugal under Salazar was accepted into the Marshall Plan (1947‚Äì1948) in return for the aid it gave to the Allies during the final stages of the war. Furthermore, also unlike Spain, it was one of the 12 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 1949, a reflection of Portugal's role as an ally against communism during the Cold War in spite of its status as the only non-democratic founder.Nicolau Andresen, \\"The Salazar Regime and European Integration, 1947‚Äì1972,\\" European Review of History (2007) 14#2 pp. 195‚Äì214  See also  * Foreign relations of Portugal :* Anglo-Portuguese Alliance :* Cape Verde in World War II * Neutral powers during World War II * Exiles Memorial Center  References   Sources     Klemmer, Harvey \\"Lisbon ‚Äì Gateway to Warring Europe\\", National Geographic, August 1941   * Wheeler Douglas L. \\"The Price of Neutrality: Portugal, the Wolfram Question, and World War II\\" Luso-Brazilian Review Vol. 23, No. 1 (Summer, 1986), pp. 107‚Äì127  Further reading  * Category:Military history of Portugal ","title":"Portugal during World War II"},{"id":"8877566","text":"Eve Gil in 2019.

J. Ehlers, 1967, p. 160; publicly available at https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19660007407 It is also known as the Lorentzian orbifold \\\\mathbb{R}^{1,1}/\\\\text{boost}. It is a simplified, two- dimensional version of the Taub-NUT spacetime. It contains a non-curvature singularity and is an important counterexample to various hypotheses in general relativity. Metric The simplest description of Misner space is to consider two-dimensional Minkowski space with the metric : ds^2= -dt^2 + dx^2, with the identification of every pair of spacetime points by a constant boost : (t, x) \\\\to (t \\\\cosh (\\\\pi) + x \\\\sinh(\\\\pi), x \\\\cosh (\\\\pi) + t \\\\sinh(\\\\pi)). It can also be defined directly on the cylinder manifold \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times S with coordinates (t', \\\\varphi) by the metric : ds^2= -2dt'd\\\\varphi + t'd\\\\varphi^2, The two coordinates are related by the map : t= 2 \\\\sqrt{-t'} \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\right) : x= 2 \\\\sqrt{-t'} \\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2}\\\\right) and : t'= \\\\frac{1}{4}(x^2 - t^2) : \\\\phi= 2 \\\\tanh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{t}\\\\right) Causality Misner space is a standard example for the study of causality since it contains both closed timelike curves and a compactly generated Cauchy horizon, while still being flat (since it is just Minkowski space). With the coordinates (t', \\\\varphi), the loop defined by t = 0, \\\\varphi = \\\\lambda, with tangent vector X = (0,1), has the norm g(X,X) = 0, making it a closed null curve. This is the chronology horizon : there are no closed timelike curves in the region t < 0, while every point admits a closed timelike curve through it in the region t > 0. This is due to the tipping of the light cones which, for t < 0, remains above lines of constant t but will open beyond that line for t > 0, causing any loop of constant t to be a closed timelike curve. Chronology protection Misner space was the first spacetime where the notion of chronology protection was used for quantum fields, by showing that in the semiclassical approximation, the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor for the vacuum \\\\langle T_{\\\\mu u} \\\\rangle_\\\\Omega is divergent.

He emerged as a controversial figure in the press and political circles for campaigning for women's personal rights, a taboo subject in Afghanistan's culture. Currently, he is the leader of the National Congress Party of Afghanistan and is one of the nine representatives of Badakhshan province in the lower house of parliament.  Biography  Born in Badakhshan in 1963 to a Persian-speaking TƒÅjƒ´k family, Latƒ´f PedrƒÅm is a writer, poet, journalist, and professor of Persian literature. He was director of the library of the Hakƒ´m NƒÅ·π£er ·∏™o·π£row Bal·∏´ƒ´ Cultural Center. First a supporter of the communist government, he soon began to openly criticize and oppose the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and turned toward Ahmad Shah Masood. He stayed in Afghanistan during most of the war years, moving around the country to be able to pursue his activities. Latƒ´f PedrƒÅm was finally forced into exile by the advance of the Pashtun-dominated Taliban and their policies of ethnic and linguistic segregation. Before returning to Afghanistan after the demise of the Taliban, he lived for a while in France where he studied political sciences and attempted to promote Afghanistan's Persian poetry and literature. Political views Latƒ´f PedrƒÅm is a strong supporter of secularism, federalism and decentralization in Afghanistan. He denounces corruption and strongly opposes Islamic fundamentalism. He advocates an independent, but decentralized Afghanistan, and believes that the country should be divided into autonomous regions under the control of regional capitals. Although his party is multi-ethnic and is, so far, the only opposition party that is not linked to an armed group,Democracy in Danger: Latif Pedram placed under house arrest he is regarded by some as a secular Tajik nationalist politician. Perhaps his most controversial statement is the demand for a name-change in Afghanistan. In many publications and articles, he proposed the change of the name \\"Afghanistan\\" to \\"Khorasan\\", the medieval name of the region, in order to settle some inter-ethnic feuds. His statement is based on the fact that the current name of the country is synonymous with \\"Land of Pashtuns\\".

However, In an interview on Khorasan TV he denied this claim and said that his voice was tampered with. This led to hot editorial crossfires among the press and in the Parliament and Cabinet, echoing with ethnic conflicts when ethnic blocks were identified supporting and criticizing Pedram. Following this, the government of Afghanistan tried banning the National Congress Party of Afghanistan and ordered that \\"comments about former kings, the president and Jihadi leaders are not allowed.\\" Since the incident, Pedram lived under house arrest in Kabul until November 2008. While expressing its concern regarding the regression of democracy in Afghanistan one year before the 2009 presidential elections, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) called for the unconditional release of Latƒ´f PedrƒÅm. 2009 Presidential election In January 2009 an article by A·∏•mad Madjidyar of the American Enterprise Institute included PedrƒÅm on a list of fifteen possible candidates in the controversial 2009 Afghan Presidential election.

The book is based on her memories of her growing up summers in Mississippi and the 1964 passage of the Civil Rights Act. Two boys, best friends, want to swim at the town pool together the day it opens to \\"everybody under the sun, no matter what color,\\" but find out that they can't, as the pool has been filled in \\"with hot, spongy tar.\\" The decision they make after this event is one that cements their friendship.

Another picture book, One Wide Sky, was published in 2003 (Harcourt Brace). It is a rhyming counting book that depicts the joys of the natural world and family. It was a Children's Book of the Month Club selection and has accompanying music written by Jim Pearce. The Aurora County Trilogy The Aurora County Trilogy consists of three novels that take place in the fictional Aurora County, Mississippi, which is really Jasper County, Mississippi, and the place that Wiles spent part of her childhood summers. Her father was born and raised in Louin, Mississippi, and her grandmother and great-grandmother lived there most of their lives. Louin becomes the town of Halleluia in Love, Ruby Lavender, the town of Snapfinger in Each Little Bird that Sings, and the towns Mabel and Halleluia in The Aurora County All-Stars. Love, Ruby Lavender (Harcourt Brace), was published in 2001 and is about a nine-year-old girl, Ruby, who lives in Halleluia, Mississippi. In this book, her grandmother of a best friend takes a vacation to Hawaii, leaving Ruby to put up with Melba Jane, who has not stop bothering her since the accident with Melba's father and Ruby's grandfather last summer.

Each Little Bird That Sings (Harcourt Brace) published in 2005, is about Comfort Snowberger who lives in Snapfinger Mississippi. Her family lives above a funeral home that they run, and Comfort writes obituaries for the paper. She knows exactly what flowers to bring, what dish to take, and who not to bring to a visitation and funeral, since she has been to at least 200. Number one on that last list is her sniffling, whiney cousin Peach. When her Great-great-Aunt Florentine dies, straight after her Uncle Edisto, all Comfort wants to do is curl up in her closet and hide with her big dog, Dismay, even if it is the most important funeral of her life so far. Unfortunately, she has to go, and take whiney Peach with her, and on top of that, her best friend Declaration is turning downright mean. Comfort learns that life is full of surprises, and the biggest one is learning how to handle them. As Uncle Edisto tells her, \\"Open your arms to life! Let it strut into your heart, in all its messy glory!\\" 'Each Little Bird that Sings' was a National Book Award Finalist. The Aurora County All-Stars (Harcourt) completes the trilogy of Mississippi novels that includes Each Little Bird That Sings and Love, Ruby Lavender. It is about a young pitcher named House Jackson, whose hero is the Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax. House's team, the Aurora County All-Stars, is a small community team that has only one game every year at four-o-clock on July 4, without fail, against the Raleigh Redbugs. Unfortunately for House, his pitching elbow was broken before last year's game, and his team lost. This year though, he is going to give that game all he has. July 4 happens to also be the town's 200th anniversary this year, and the town is holding a pageant, for which all mothers have signed up their children, including the baseball players. The director of the pageant is 14-year-old Frances Shotz, the same girl who broke House's elbow. 'The Aurora County All-Stars' shows what it truly means to be strong, to create community, and to sacrifice for a friend.

At the end of his career he was a Conservative Party politician, serving as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1984. Education Warner was educated at Wixenford School, Wokingham, and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He then went to Magdalen College, Oxford, and also studied at the University of Sheffield.‚ÄòWARNER, Sir Frederick Archibald (Sir Fred)‚Äô, in Who Was Who 1991‚Äì1995 (London: A. & C. Black, 1996, ) Diplomatic service After service in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, Warner joined the Foreign Office in February 1946 as an Assistant Principal. Within a few months he had transferred to the Diplomatic Service as a Second Secretary. In 1950 Warner was promoted to First Secretary and posted to the British Embassy in Moscow. Warner returned to a London posting at the end of 1951. He was working in the private office of Hector McNeil with Guy Burgess at the time of Burgess' defection to the Soviet Union; Burgess' wayward behaviour at the time later led to accusations that Warner should have raised concerns about him. These accusations stalled Warner's career briefly: he remained in London for five years before in 1956 he was made acting Charg√© d'affaires at the embassy in Rangoon, Burma. From 1958 he was transferred to Athens, Greece. In 1960 Warner was made Head of the South-East Asia Department of the Foreign Office. Advancement From 1964 to 1965, Warner was transferred to the Imperial Defence College where he learned more about the relationship between defence and foreign policy. He was made Ambassador to Laos from 1965 to 1967, and then served as Minister to NATO throughout 1968. A brief return to London as Under-Secretary of State at the (newly merged) Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1969 was followed by the role of Ambassador and Deputy Permanent United Kingdom Representative to the United Nations. Ambassadorship Warner married for the first time in New York City in 1971, Simone Georgina de Ferranti (N√©e Nangle), who gave him a stepdaughter and two sons of his own, one of whom is TV chef Valentine Warner. At the end of that year he was named as Ambassador to Japan and learned Japanese at the University of Sheffield. He made the arrangements for the visit of Edward Heath to Japan, the first such visit by a sitting British Prime Minister. Despite Warner's unstuffiness (which ruffled some feathers among the Japanese civil servants who expected more formality), he became popular and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st Class. At the end of his posting Warner hoped for a top flight post, conceivably even as Ambassador to Paris or to Washington. He was disappointed when others were named to these posts, and Warner retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1975, reasoning that it would be easier for him to start a second career as early as possible. Business career He then went into business, becoming a business consultant and Director of Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. He later picked up directorships of the Mercantile and General Reinsurance Company Ltd, Chloride Group Ltd, Guinness Peat Group, Loral International Inc., and Vicarello SpA. He settled in Somerset and became Chairman of the Wessex Region of the National Trust from 1976 to 1978. European Parliament At the 1979 elections to the European Parliament, Warner was elected as a Conservative MEP for Somerset. He specialised in international affairs, successfully urging the European Commission to help fund Afghan refugees and bemoaning the Iranian government's failure to respect diplomatic immunity in the Iran hostage crisis. He helped draw up the European policy in the Conservative manifesto for the 1983 general election. Standing down at the 1984 election, Warner co- authored a pamphlet that November calling for the United Kingdom to become a full member of the European Monetary System. He was Chairman of the Overseas Committee of the Confederation of British Industry from 1985 to 1988, and in 1991 published a book titled \\"Anglo-Japanese Financial Relations\\".

He received a Fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons in 1903 and joined the staff of the Royal Infirmary. He served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in the First World War. As a young surgeon, he travelled around the world, being received by the Pope, Benito Mussolini, the King of Italy and King Alfonso of Spain. In 1927 he was made Professor of Surgery in the University of Durham. In 1934 he was elected President of the Medical Society of London and in 1935 delivered the Bradshaw Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons. After the war, Grey Turner was briefly famous for performing one of the earliest operations to attempt the removal of a bullet from a soldier's heart. The bullet was never removed, but Grey Turner's surgery saved the patient's life. During the following decades, Grey Turner worked with early cancer research, and anticipated the development of chemotherapy (\\"We shall never overcome cancer by surgery: it will be something we will inject\\").

Biography  =From Democrato to Fluxus= Ay-O started his career in the Democrato Artist Association („Éá„É¢„ÇØ„É©„Éº„ÉàÁæéË°ìÂÆ∂Âçî‰ºö), created by Ei-Q. This association promoted artistic freedom and independence in making art. The influence of these values on Ay-O can be seen in a series of early paintings over which he painted a large X because he thought they were not original enough. Another independent movement was close to Democrato in Japan: S≈çz≈ç Biiku (ÂâµÈÄ†ÁæéËÇ≤) by the collector Sadajir≈ç Kubo (‰πÖ‰øùË≤ûÊ¨°ÈÉûÔºâpromoting nurturing freedom when teaching art. Both movements started in Fukui Prefecture in Japan and explain the special bond Ay-O developed with the place. S≈çz≈ç Biiku's approach challenges the traditional Japanese Master-Student relationship. As such, like naive art, the movement promotes ways independent to the culturally established ones. Kubo also created the \\"Small Collector Society\\" (Â∞è„Ç≥„É¨„ÇØ„Çø„Éº„ÅÆ‰ºö) to spread art collection in society. Some of the works from this period in the 50s show an influence from Fernand L√©ger with massive bodies on the canvas, such as the Pastoral (Den'en) from 1956.PastoralTokyo 1955‚Äì1970: A New Avant-Garde at MoMA Ay-O was introduced to George Maciunas by Yoko Ono in 1961 and formally joined Maciunas in Fluxus in 1963. Ay-O was known for his Finger Boxes and for his performance events when he was active in Fluxus. He worked closely with fellow Fluxus artists Maciunas, Emmett Williams, Dick Higgins and Nam June Paik. Ay-O and Nam June Paik were roommates and became friends in the Soho Fluxus style coop. =The Rainbow Artist= Ay-O established a reputation in the avant-gardes of Japan, Europe and the United States. In Japan, he is known as the \\"Rainbow Man\\" for his use of colorful, rainbow-striped motifs in his artwork. In its purest form, some paintings are simple gradations of the rainbow, with up to 192 gradations. 250px Example with 96 gradations Ay-O represented Japan at the Venice Biennale in 1966 and at the S√£o Paulo Biennale in 1971. He also built the famed \\"Tactile Rainbow\\" at the Osaka World's Fair in 1970. In 1971, true to his Demokato debut, he adapted 10 American Na√Øve paintings and created a rainbow version that he called Nashville Skyline. Ay-O's attachment to Douanier Rousseau's work is another proof of his interest for na√Øve art. In 1987 he did a series of Rainbow Happenings, with Rainbow Happening #17 being a 300m Rainbow Eiffel Tower project in Paris. As a rainbow artist Ay-O's work embraces abstraction more decisively than in his previous period, and human form when present in a rainbow context becomes itself abstract. One special work from the period 8:15 A.M. (1988), done for Hiroshima's MOCA represents the explosion with his Rainbow palette . = Recent Activities = One of his projects in English was a Collective Portrait of George Maciuanas, that he co-edited with Emmett Williams and Ann Noel. In the recent decade Ay-O has exhibited regularly at the Emily Harvey Gallery in (1996, 2001) and Gallery Itsutsuji (1996,2005,2007,2012) and Gallery Goto (1999,2004) in Japan. In Japan Ay-O is part of the collection of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kyoto (see 2005 Tokyo exhibition in the links). In 2001 Ay-O had a room in the special exhibit \\"La fluxus Constellation\\" in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Genoa. He was also represented in various other Fluxus exhibitions around the world as \\"Centraal Fluxus Festival\\" Centraal Museum, Utrecht (2003), \\"Fluxus & Non Fluxus Fluxus\\" Randers kunstmuseum (2006). Being present at both the Venice Biennale in 1966 and at the S√£o Paulo Biennale in 1971, Ay-O was one of the \\"Twelve Japanese Artists from the Venice Biennale 1952-2001,\\" in Art Tower Mito ATM, Mito. At the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo, Ay-O was part of two exhibitions: \\"Tokyo-Berlin / Berlin-Tokyo\\" in 2005 and \\"All about laughter\\" in 2007. Finally in 2012 the MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART TOKYO (MOT) showed a large retrospective exhibition: \\"Over the Rainbow once more.\\" This was followed by the retrospective being shown at the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art through to 14.1.2013.. The 300m Rainbow from Happening #17 was part of the show . Hiroshima's MOCA exhibit was the occasion of one more happening performed by Ay-O and his team : a Fluxus revival performance, succession of 30 shorts representing each a different Fluxus artists . This was Ay-O's way to celebrate the 50th birthday of Fluxus, and a Japanese echo the Wiesbaden events . In 2012 the MOMA produced an exhibit titled : Tokyo 1955-1970 Avant Garde where Ay-O's work in that period are presented. =Fukui (2006) and Japan (2012) Retrospective= Ay-O did his most complete retrospective exhibitions in Japan - first in the Fukui Art Museum in 2006 organized the first retrospective. This exhibition was the occasion for the artist to write a bilingual book \\"Over the Rainbow, Ay-O Retrospective 1950-2006,\\" in which he provides an overview of his work. In 2012 similar retrospective augmented by recent works \\"Ay-O: Over the Rainbow Once More\\" is shown in various locations in Japan (e.g., ) - the inaugural exhibit was in the Tokyo MOT . The catalog of the 2012 exhibits clarifies a few points of the reference book from the 2006 exhibit. Finger boxes Ay-O's Tactile Box and Finger Box on display in the exhibition Art, Anti-Art, Non-Art: Experimentations in the Public Sphere in Postwar Japan, 1950-1970 at the alt=A museum exhibit comprising a table, in the corner of a room between a door with a fire alarm handle, with a glass case on top containing two wooden boxes with holes in the top. The front of the table comprises a printed description of the exhibits within the case and several holes, simulating the artworks within the case. The Finger Boxes are works of art by Ay-O that are the most tactile works of art in the Fluxus project. Ay-O first produced them in 1964. There are rumors that they were invented before WWII, however this is unconfirmed. It is said that all of the original Finger Boxes were destroyed during the fighting. Ay-O is said to have learned of this and claimed the invention for himself. p.38. The artworks comprise largely identical hollow cubical wooden boxes with finger-sized holes in one face. As tactile works of art, it is necessary to touch them to perceive them, by placing one's finger into the hole to feel the material that is hidden within the box. The hidden contents of the boxes comprise such various things as beads, bristle brushes, hair, cotton balls, nails, and sponges. The artist's intent, by including things such as nails, which can potentially prick the finger, in the possible contents of the box is to ensure that the user touches the box with an \\"enquiring, learning gesture\\". The finger boxes are also intended to be touched by multiple people at a time, promoting a shared, social, experience of perceiving the work. Several versions of the Finger Box exist, including one set of boxes in a briefcase (entitled Finger Box (valise edition)) which is in the Gilbert and Lila Silverman Fluxus Collection in Detroit, and a version (included in Fluxus I) that uses sealed envelopes that have been slit open instead of boxes. In the 2012 Japan retrospective, \\"Over the Rainbow once More\\" - a larger work is presented around the finger boxes‚Äîit is a cubic room in which the viewer/toucher enters. The wall of this room is paved with square rainbow motifs - where concentric squares with the colors of the rainbow are painted around a hole in the wall. Behind each hole a finger box has been appended on the other side. Prints True to his Japanese beginning and the Democrato movement Ay-O took some special care to produce print version of his work. Some of his work exist both as oil on Canvas and print (96 gradations for example). Ay-O personally gets involved in the process. Examples can be seen here . Prints are a way to paint rainbows as one. In a way similar to the execution of the Nashville Skyline (where the color was applied by others), Ay-O use number coding to communicate with his printers, 12 is lemon yellow, 1 red, 24 purple. The rainbow is then the consecutive integers. In prints inspired from the shunga tradition, as for example \`Ten komanda no zu, k≈çbutsu ÂçÅÈñã„ÅÆÂúñ Ëôπ‰Ωõ (Depiction of the Ten Commandments, Rainbow Buddha) ' Rainbow Hokusai, 1970, from the British Museum Collection , the printing technique assembles 54 separate square cards, each printed with part of the design. Happenings This is a rainbow happening by Ay-o. Happenings are a tradition from the Fluxus movement. Many fluxus members organise or participate in such happenings. One remembers Piano Activities and Yoko Ono Cut Piece. Ay-O has participated and organised such happenings since the 1960s and continues until recent times. The early happenings were all over the world. In New-York (1965) in Flux Hall \\"Memoriam of Adriano Olivetti,\\" \\"Rainbow Staircase Environment, 363 Canal Street, New York, November 20\\" , \\"Rainbow Music #1,\\" Tokyo (1966) \\"Happening for a sightseeing bus trip in Tokyo\\" with its movie on the Museum of Modern Art website , Fukui (1986) Rainbow Happening #16, a 25-meter rainbow in the Eiheiji Temple, Paris (1987) Rainbow Happening #17. A happening was part of his 2012 retrospective, and for the Rainbow Dinner the same year. This is a rainbow happening by Ay-o. Organised by Ay-O the rainbow pro-eminently figures in such happenings. In both the 2006 and the 2012 retrospectives some theme mixing traditional fluxus themes (like 'One for Violin' executed in 2006 by Nam June Paik) - a portable and explosive version of Piano Activities and Ay-o specific themes are present. Execution of the rainbow signature Kappa As can be seen on some of his T-shirts, Ay-O likes to identify with a mythological creature from Japanese Folklore. The name of the creature is Kappa (folklore). One can see for example Ay-O represented as Kappa on the pastries of his 81st birthday party. Ay-O as Kappa (81st birthday party) Sometime the Kappa persona appears in works like in these 'fluxus masks' where Ay-o by the simple application of his rainbow palette assimilates a traditional piece of folklore into contemporary art. Signatures Ay-O has several phases with different signatures. In older works in the 1950s the signature is mostly and traditionally written in plain letters with the date as for example in the 1955 signature. This is a signature from AY-O At the same time in the pre-rainbow period some of the painting were frequently done on wood and the signature is sometime etched in the wood. In this 1954 example it is etched as 'O ai'. This is a signature from AY-O With arrival of the rainbow period in the 1980s some new signature is introduced where the O encircles the other letter in a cartouche-like manner like in this example of 1985 on one of the large 96 gradations work. This is a signature from AY-O Last but not least the rainbow artist developed his 'signature signature': the rainbow signature used mostly for autographs and paper. This is one of his mini happenings. To produce it AY-O puts felt-pin pens in his fist with all colors of the rainbow and signs with it as can be seen in this picture of a book signed with the rainbow signature.This is a signature of Ay-O. This is the rainbow signature. On paper Ay-O signs using roman letters and his kanji (ÈùâÂòî). This is a paper signature of Ay-O with kanji As for the origin of the name from Ay-O's own and most recent retrospective catalog \\"Over the rainbow once more\\" (2012), page 75: \\"Ay-O, an unusual pseudonym for a Japanese, was conceived during Ay-O's third year at Tokyo Kyoiku University, when he had his friends choose then favorite sounds from the Japanese syllabary A, I, U, E and O.

This class of machine emerged in the 1960s, with models from Digital Equipment Corporation (PDP line), Data General (NOVA), Hewlett-Packard (HP3000) widely used in science and research as well as for business - and referred to as minicomputers. IBM favored the term \\"midrange computer\\" for their comparable, but more business-oriented, systems. IBM System/38 IBM Midrange Systems * System/3 was the first of the IBM midrange systems (1969) * System/32 (introduced in 1975) was a 16-bit single- user system also known as the IBM 5320. * System/34 (1977) was intended as successor to both the 3 and the 32. * System/38 (1979) was the first Midrange system to have an integrated relational database management system (DBMS). The 38 had 48-bit addressing. * System/36 (1983) had two 16-bit processors with an operating system that supported multiprogramming. * AS/400 was introduced under that name in 1988, renamed eServer iSeries in 2000, and subsequently became IBM System i in 2006. * IBM System i was subsequently replaced by the IBM Power Systems in April 2008.

Midrange systems are primarily high-end network servers and other types of servers that can handle the large-scale processing of many business applications. Although not as powerful as mainframe computers, they are less costly to buy, operate, and maintain than mainframe systems and thus meet the computing needs of many organizations. Midrange systems have become popular as powerful network servers to help manage large Internet Web sites, corporate intranets and extranets, and other networks. Today, midrange systems include servers used in industrial process- control and manufacturing plants and play major roles in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). They can also take the form of powerful technical workstations for computer-aided design (CAD) and other computation and graphics-intensive applications.

Mature CXCL14 has many of the conserved features of the CXC chemokine subfamily but has some differences too, such as a shorter N-terminus and five extra amino acids in the region between its third and fourth cysteines. CXCL14 is constitutively expressed at high levels in many normal tissues, where its cellular source is thought to be fibroblasts. However, it is reduced or absent from most cancer cells. This chemokine is chemotactic for monocytes and can activate these cells in the presence of an inflammatory mediator called prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). It is also a potent chemoattractant and activator of dendritic cells, is implicated in homing of these cells, and can stimulate the migration of activated NK cells. CXCL14 also inhibits angiogenesis, possibly as a result of its ability to block endothelial cell chemotaxis. The gene for CXCL14 contains four exons and is located on chromosome 5 in humans.

In contrast to democracy, where citizens are able to participate in the making of decisions that affect them, electocracy sees decision-making limited to an elected individual or group who may then govern in an arbitrary and unaccountable manner until the next election. The United States government for example, elects a president to govern the nation. This \\"winner-takes-all\\" election is an example of electocracy within a democracy as the president of the United States has the final say in governmental decisions on a national level. Where democracy separates itself in the United States government from electocracy is on the local level.

In addition to local shops, primary school, church, village hall and parks, the village is home to the National Trust for Scotland's Pitmedden Garden and the Formartine United Football Club. Pitmedden along with the Parish of Udny is served by the Udny Community Trust, which owns and operates an Enercon E48 wind turbine at Tillymaud to the south of Pitmedden. Udny Community Trust distributes the profits from the wind energy project for local charitable purposes. The village and most of Udny are served by a Community Newsletter called the Pitmedden News. During World War II, Pitmedden had a prisoner of war camp. This was located on the south side of the Bronie Burn, and there was an access bridge to access it. The entrance to the camp is about 100 yards from the Aberdeen/Tarves/Oldmeldrum fork in Pitmedden, on the Oldmeldrum road. On 25 October 1945 at the Millton of Dumbreck farm, 36 year old Italian prisoner of war Martino Favilli died of an illness. Prisoners cycled each day to work on local farms; one local farmer still has small items made by the prisoners.

The main components are color coded lines to indicate each line or service, with named icons to indicate stations or stops. Transit maps can be found in the transit vehicles, at the platforms or in printed timetables. Their primary function is to help users to efficiently use the public transport system, including which stations function as interchange between lines. Unlike conventional maps, transit maps are usually not geographically accurate‚Äîinstead they use straight lines and fixed angles, and often illustrate a fixed distance between stations, compressing those in the outer area of the system and expanding those close to the center. History The mapping of transit systems was at first generally geographically accurate, but abstract route-maps of individual lines (usually displayed inside the carriages) can be traced back as early as 1908 (London's District line), and certainly there are examples from European and American railroad cartography as early as the 1890s where geographical features have been removed and the routes of lines have been artificially straightened out. But it was George Dow of the London and North Eastern Railway who was the first to launch a diagrammatic representation of an entire rail transport network (in 1929); his work is seen by historians of the subject as being part of the inspiration for Harry Beck when he launched his iconic London Underground map in 1933. After this pioneering work, many transit authorities worldwide imitated the diagrammatic look for their own networks, some while continuing to also publish hybrid versions that were geographically accurate. Early maps of the Berlin U-Bahn, Berlin S-Bahn, Boston T, Paris M√©tro, and New York City Subway also exhibited some elements of the diagrammatic form. The new Madrid Metro map (of 2007), designed by the RaRo Agency, took the idea of a simple diagram one step further by becoming one of the first produced for a major network to remove diagonal lines altogether; it is constituted just by horizontal and vertical lines only at right angles to each other. After many complaints over its disadvantages, the company reverted to the previous map in 2013. Transit maps are now increasingly digitized and can be shown in many forms online. Elements Schematic transit map of Miami/South Florida regional rail transit, where there are several types of systems from intercity and commuter rail down to automated people movers and a small heavy rail system with a bus rapid transit feeder. It is not to scale, the area covered is about north- south by wide. The primary purpose of a transit map is to help passengers‚Äîespecially those unfamiliar with the system‚Äîto take the correct routes to travel between two points; this may include having to change vehicle or mode in the course of the trip. The map uses symbols to illustrate the lines, stations and transfer points, as well as a system of geographic identification. At the same time the map must remain simple to allow overview, and be usable by those unfamiliar with the geography of the area. Stations are marked with symbols that break the line, along with their names, so they may be referred to on other maps or travel itineraries. Further help may be granted through the inclusion of important tourist attractions and other locations such as the city center; these may be identified through symbols or wording. Color coding allows the map to specify each line in an easy way, allowing the users to quickly identify where each specific line goes; if it does not go to the desired destination, the colors and symbols allow the user to identify a feasible point of transfer between lines. Symbols such as aircraft may be used to illustrate airports, and symbols of trains may be used to identify stations that allow transfer to other modes, such as commuter or intercity train services. With the widespread use of zone pricing for fare calculation, systems that span more than one zone need a system to inform the use which zone a particular station is located in. Common ways include varying the tone of the background color, or by running a weak line along the zone boundaries. Many transit authorities publish multiple maps of their systems; this can be done by isolating one mode of transport, for instance only rapid transit or only bus, onto a single map, or instead the authorities publish maps covering only a limited area, but with greater detail. Another modification is to produce geographically accurate maps of the system, to allow users to better understand the routes. Even if official geographical accurate maps are not available, these can often be obtained from unofficial sources since the information is available from other sources. Iconic status There are a growing number of books, websites and works of art on the subject of urban rail and metro map design and use. There are now hundreds of examples of diagrams in an urban rail or metro map style that are used to represent everything from other transit networks like buses and national rail services to sewerage systems and Derbyshire public houses. One of the most well-known adaptations of an urban rail map was The Great Bear, a lithograph by Simon Patterson. First shown in 1992 and nominated for the Turner Prize, The Great Bear replaces station names on the London Underground map with those of explorers, saints, film stars, philosophers and comedians. Other artists such as Scott Rosenbaum, and Ralph Gray have also taken the iconic style of the urban rail map and made new artistic creations ranging from the abstract to the solar system. Following the success of these the idea of adapting other urban rail and metro maps has spread so that now almost every major subway or rapid transit system with a map has been doctored with different names, often anagrams of the original station name. Some maps including those for the rapid transit systems of New York City, Washington D.C., Boston, Montreal, and Denver, have been recreated to include the names of local bars that have a good selection of craft beers.

Their scope of inquiry includes North America and related histories of the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, and Africa. Since 1943 the Institute has published the William and Mary Quarterly and books, and sponsored conferences and fellowships. The College of William & Mary and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation founded the Institute of Early American History and Culture in 1943. The College continues to jointly sponsor its work. In 1996, the name Omohundro was added to the Institute‚Äôs name in recognition of a generous gift from the late Mr. and Mrs. Malvern H. Omohundro, Jr.  Publications  = Books = The Institute publishes a select number of books each year on topics pertaining to the histories and cultures of North America from circa 1450 to 1820, including related developments in the British Isles, Europe, West Africa, and the Caribbean. Since the first book appeared in print in 1947, the OI has published 233 titles, which have won a total of 174 awards. The Institute partners with the University of North Carolina Press in publishing its titles, and UNC Press also distributes the OI's books. = William and Mary Quarterly = The William and Mary Quarterly is an academic journal with a focus on early American history and culture. It ranges chronologically from Old World-New World contacts to about 1820. Geographically, it focuses on North America from New France and the Spanish-American borderlands to British America and the Caribbean and extends to Europe and West Africa. Although grounded in history, it welcomes works from all disciplines (for example, literature, law, political science, anthropology, archaeology, material culture, cultural studies) bearing on the early American period. Currently in its Third Series, the Quarterly is published in January, April, July, and October. The journal originated in 1892, making it one of the oldest scholarly journals in the United States. = Digital publications = In addition to a regular blog (Uncommon Sense), the OI maintains both an online feed of blogs about early American scholarship and (Early America Online aka \\"The Octo\\"), an up-to-date listing of conferences and events of interest to the Early Americanist community (The Map) and a current listing of fellowships and grants available for research in the field (The List). The OI also publishes the OI Reader, which features a digital edition of the William and Mary Quarterly as well as additional digital projects.  Fellowships  thumb All OI fellowship applicants are evaluated by outside committees of scholars who volunteer their time and expertise. The following scholarships are offered: * Omohundro Institute-NEH Postdoctoral Research Fellowship * Lemon Project Postdoctoral Fellowship * Scholars' Workshop * Georgian Papers Programme Fellowship * Jamestown Rediscovery-Omohundro Institute Short-term Fellowship * OI-Folger Institute Short-term Fellowship * Lapidus-OIEAHC Fellowship  Events  Most OI events are open to the public; costs to the participant vary. = Annual conferences = The OI offers an annual conference in June each year. The location varies each year in order to accommodate a wide range of scholars. Panels and papers are chosen by an external committee. The committee typically represents a large variety of institutions and disciplines and is formed by members from the host institution. Graduate students, junior, mid-career and senior scholars are all invited to submit proposals via a Call for Papers; all levels of career achievement are likewise represented on the final program. = Topical conferences = The OI also typically offers one topically-themed conference each year, usually in the fall. The location varies. An organizing theme or topic is proposed by a group of scholars who then form a program committee and issue a Call for Papers. The number of papers and panels offered is typically smaller than at the annual conference, likewise the overall number of participants. = THis Camp = THis Camp (or That History Camp) sessions are now offered at every OI conference. The goal of the sessions is to teach participants one software of particular use to historians at a Beginner's level. Max Edelson, University of Virginia, taught the first THis Camp in October 2015 at the \\"Emerging Histories of the Early Modern French Atlantic\\" (topical) conference. By the end of the session, participants were able to use the popular Map Scholar software to annotate maps and begin their own digital atlases. = WMQ-EMSI workshops = Each May, the William and Mary Quarterly in conjunction with the Early Modern Studies Institute at the University of Southern California conducts a workshop designed to identify and encourage new trends in our understanding of the history and culture of early North America. The participants are primarily mature scholars working on second or subsequent book projects; they share their work in progress with the aim of deepening and enriching their perspectives, their approaches, and ultimately the final products of their research. = Colloquia = The OI‚Äôs colloquium meets four or five times a semester to discuss projects (usually a book chapter) in progress. The Institute offers overnight accommodations and up to $300 for travel for those chosen to present their work.

He is the founder of Musashigawa stable and a former chairman of the Japan Sumo Association. He was born in Matsusaka, Mie, Japan.  Career  His father was a construction worker who competed in amateur sumo tournaments. The young Mienoumi did judo at junior high school and was introduced to a coach at Dewanoumi stable, but was initially rejected due to his short stature. He contacted the stable again a few years later, and this time was accepted by Dewanoumi Oyataka himself, the former Dewanohana Kuniichi. His first bout was in July 1963, aged just 15. At first fighting under his family name of Ishiyama, he switched to the shikona of Mienoumi in 1966. After being personally trained by the new Dewanoumi Oyakaya, former yokozuna Sadanoyama, he developed his technique and was promoted to j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1969, and makuuchi, the top division, in September 1969. In July of the following year, he reached the rank of komusubi, defeating two yokozuna (Taih≈ç and Tamanoumi) and receiving his first prize (shukun-sh≈ç). He was promoted to sekiwake in the next tournament in September 1970. He suffered from a chronic liver problem throughout his career, and although he tried to keep it under control by changing his diet, it was a factor in his eventual retirement. In September 1974 his 11th day match with Futagodake was declared a draw (hikiwake). This is the last draw in the top division to date. He won his first makuuchi tournament or y≈´sh≈ç in November 1975 and was promoted to ≈çzeki the following January. He lost a majority of bouts in the next two tournaments, resulting in an automatic demotion back to sekiwake, but a good result of 10 wins to 5 losses in the next tournament was sufficient to restore him to ≈çzeki. In May 1979 he was a runner-up for the fourth time, to Wakanohana with a 13‚Äì2 record. He followed that up with a superb 14‚Äì1 record in the following tournament, defeating Wakanohana, Kitanoumi and Wajima, only losing the championship in a playoff to Wajima on the final day. In September 1979 he was finally promoted to yokozuna. The 97 tournaments it took him to do so is the slowest ever progress to sumo's top rank. His oyakata declared that he would be happy with just one more y≈´sh≈ç before Mienoumi's retirement. In the event, Mienoumi won his second and third tournaments as yokozuna, the latter with a perfect score, but after this had several absences due to injury and illness, fighting a full fifteen bouts in only four tournaments as yokozuna, before retiring in November 1980. He has the lowest win-loss ratio of any post-war yokozuna. After retirement Upon retirement Mienoumi took the name of Musashigawa Oyakata and established Musashigawa stable in 1981. Until then Dewanoumi stable had discouraged any breaking away, and he was the first from Dewanoumi in 62 years to amicably set up a new stable. By 2000 Musashigawa stable had become one of the strongest stables in sumo with a yokozuna, Musashimaru, and three ≈çzeki, Dejima, Mus≈çyama and Miyabiyama. Musashigawa performed an early kanreki dohy≈ç-iri in 2007 (normally performed on a yokozuna's 60th birthday) to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of Musashigawa stable. On September 8, 2008, he became the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association following the resignation of Kitanoumi. One of his first actions was to demand a controversial tightening up of the rules for the tachi-ai, or initial charge, which led to many false starts in the September 2008 tournament. Following a series of scandals involving wrestlers gambling and associating with organised crime members, he was suspended for the July 2010 tournament and announced his resignation the following month. He also cited health concerns, as he had been undergoing treatment for stomach cancer. In September 2010 he also stood down as head of Musashigawa stable, although he remained a coach there. Former ≈çzeki Mus≈çyama is now head coach of what is now Fujishima stable. In December 2012 he announced that the former Musashimaru would inherit his elder name when Musashigawa reached 65 years of age in February 2013. He is now director of the Sumo Museum at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. Family Mienoumi was married in September 1974. Fighting style Mienoumi was a yotsu-sumo wrestler who preferred grappling techniques to pushing or thrusting. His favourite grip on his opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a left hand inside and right hand outside position. He regularly won by yori-kiri (force out) and uwatedashinage (pulling overarm throw).

The episodes are usually 30 minutes long and have a daily slot in the evening primetime row.  Usage  The term fantaserye is often used to refer to ABS- CBN's fantasy series. The first official fantaserye was Marina, a series about a girl cursed to become a mermaid. Telefantasya often refers to the creations of GMA Network; their first telefantasya was Mulawin, a series about a humanoid bird who fell in love with a girl who was later revealed to be part- bird. But even before, GMA has its first fantasy-based soap via Ikaw Na Sana in 1997 and Pintados in 1999. ABS-CBN also reinvented the name of their fantasy TV depending on its origin, like Krystala, named superserye (pertaining to superhero) and Ang Panday as sineserye (cinematic origin). However, both are still regarded by many as fantaseryes.  History  The Fantasy genre of television has been around even before the word was conceived. Probably the first Filipino fantasy series could be regarded as Okey Ka Fairy Ko!1 produced by TAPE, Inc. in 1987 and broadcast originally on IBC Channel 13, moved to ABS-CBN until TAPE Inc. transferred its programs to GMA after its contract expired with ABS-CBN. Okey ka, Fairy Ko! is a story about Taga-Lupa (\\"Earthling\\" in English) Vic Sotto who married Engkantada (a fairy) Alice Dixson. They had children who were half-earthlings and half- fairies. The fairy, a princess in her world, had a stern mother, Ina Magenta (Charito Solis) who visited the neighborhood everyday, criticizing their lifestyle on earth (sometimes battling with evil from the dark world). Fantaserye's origins were more rooted towards situational comedy than soap opera (today's fantaseryes and telefantsayas are lined up in evening prime time along with other soap operas), and Okey ka, Fairy Ko! is proof of that. The series had a run of about seven years and was aired on one day of the week for about 60 minutes per episode. Other notable series with similar nature are Wansapanataym of ABS CBN and Beh Bote Nga of GMA Network. Telefantasyas or Fantaseryes need not only depict magical worlds in space or underwater. They may also depict future settings. Pintados, launched by GMA, could also fall under the same genre. Pintados was about a band of painted warriors (Pintados) with the power to control the elements on a mission to save the world. Nowadays, several titles fall under this genre. However, the most popular fantaseryes or telefantasyas are the ones shown weeknights during primetime television. Once-a-week fantaseryes are also included under the same genre but do not receive as much viewership as the ones shown every weeknight. Fantaseryes weren't given as much as attention earlier and thus were usually shown on a once-a-week basis with each episode running for one to one hour and a half. In 2003, ABS-CBN introduced a new genre of teleserye which mixes soap opera, fantasy, myth, magic and enchantment on a nightly basis. This genre was called fantaserye, with such shows falling under this genre broadcast on a nightly basis during primetime. The first fantaserye that was shown on primetime TV was officially Darating ang Umaga. However, it was commercially a failure. Fantasy themed TV series have been around for while already in the Philippines prior to the launch of the series Darating ang Umaga although they weren't popular on television. in 2004, ABS-CBN took another risk by showing yet another fantaserye called Marina. Unlike its predecessor, Marina set a benchmark for fantaseryes on television when it garnered consistent high ratings during its entire run. The ratings and audience share of the said fantaserye were even higher than the usual more established primetime teleseryes. Because of this, the television series Marina was officially the one that popularized the genre. Today, fantaseryes are the most viewed TV program in the Philippines. Recent surveys by media research firms AC Nielsen and AGB state that fantaseryes have the highest ratings in the evening primetime block. Although ABS-CBN started the fantaserye fad, its rival GMA network introduced its own fantasy-based series which they called telefantasya which has a similar meaning and nature as a fantaserye. After Marina, ABS-CBN produced fantasy-based series under a different name but with a similar nature in the hope of saturating the ratings game such as superserye Krystala, sineserye Ang Panday and Super Inggo. On the other hand, rival GMA network started their telefantasya run during primetime with Marinara and Mulawin. (But Marinara is more so called as kwela-novela). Although in 1997, GMA officially have their first soap with fantasy genre entitled Ikaw Na Sana. Because of this, GMA network has decided to focus on producing telefantasya shows while ABS-CBN's productions are a mix of at least one fantaserye and several other soap operas (drama).  Criticisms  = Values formation = A TV-magazine show's episode on November 5, 2005 pointed out that fantaseryes have a negative effect on the young children because they cannot clearly mark the borderline between reality and fantasy. Also in this line, the themes of the telefantasyas often feature battles between two factions: good and evil. Although the good and evil parts of the battle are clearly marked, people, especially the children emphasize more on the fights rather than the victory of good over evil. The children imitate the fights scenes and thus inculcate them in their lives. Conservatives have always critiqued the showing of violence on television as detrimental to the children's values. = Social constructionism = The theory of Social constructionism is often used as defense by the critics not just of Fantaseryes, but of the television as a postmodern invention. This theory, by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann in the 1960s suggests that reality is constructed by the society in general, and individually, by the people who interpret and perceive reality. In this case, television forms a reality in the minds of the people, specifically, as an \\"ideal\\" world on where to live in. The people perceive it and then in turn form the notion that \\"this is how life should be.\\" This happens, when, in fact, it should not be, because the television is not the reality but life is the ultimate reality.

The election was surprisingly won by John Charles Wilmot of Labour. The seat itself is wrongly regarded as a 'safe' Conservative seat because it returned a Conservative at most previous elections. However, it was marginal in most of those occasions except the remarkable circumstances of 1931 and Labour's electoral destruction. The election was seen as a test of the developing mood of pacifism in the country at the time, so much so that it became known as the 'Peace by-election'. The heavy defeat for the National Government candidate, a strong supporter of rearmament, helped, along with the Peace Ballot of 1935, to bring about a rethink in the government's agenda.

His main area of research was the use of microwave techniques to study the magnetic properties of solids. He was head of the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford from 1957 to 1977. In 1992, Bleaney received the International Zavoisky Award \\"for his contribution to the theory and practice of electron paramagnetic resonance of transition ions in crystals.\\" Biography Bleaney was born at 423 King's Road, Chelsea, London, the second son of Frederick Bleaney, a house painter, and Eva Johanne Petersen, born in Denmark. He attended the Cook‚Äôs Ground School, Chelsea from where he obtained a scholarship to Westminster City School. In 1933 he obtained an open scholarship in science to St John's College, Oxford, to read Physics. He graduated with first-class honours in 1937. Bleaney went on to do research with Professor, later Sir Francis Simon, obtaining a DPhil in 1939. He moved into the new Clarendon Laboratory but then came the war and, like so many other scientists, he was assigned to war-related work. In Bleaney‚Äôs case he was drafted into the Oxford-based Admiralty team which worked on the development of microwave techniques for radar. He made many contributions to this programme particularly in the development of klystrons. In 1943 the group was visited by Jerrold R. Zacharias from MIT who saw that their K-band reflex klystron was much easier to manufacture and more reliable than the one developed by Bell Labs. A visit by Bleaney to Waltham, MA resulted in Raytheon manufacturing them on a large scale. In 1945 Bleaney was appointed a university lecturer in Oxford, and then a fellow of St John's College in 1947. His group‚Äôs researches into resonances in a wide range of paramagnetic substances at very low temperatures resulted in Oxford‚Äôs quickly becoming ‚Äúthe major world centre for research in EPR‚Äù. In 1956 Bleaney was appointed Dr Lee‚Äôs Professor of Experimental Philosophy, succeeding Sir Francis Simon, FRS who had died suddenly after only a short time in the post. This unfortunately involved a lot of administrative work, and Bleaney stood down as soon as he felt he had played his part. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1950, and became a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1974. He was appointed CBE in 1965. =Family= In 1949, Brebis Bleaney married Betty Isabelle Plumpton at St Nicolas Church, Guildford. Betty had been his student; they published a book together: Electricity and Magnetism, in two volumes (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1957). The couple had two children, Michael, now a noted economist, and Carol Heather, who was at SOAS University of London and has published widely on the Middle East. Bleaney died on 4 November 2006 at his home, Garford House, Garford Road, Oxford, and was cremated at Oxford crematorium.

The same prefix appears in Sanskrit, also as a-, an-. In Slavic languages the privative is nie- and u-, e.g. nieboga, ubogi. In North Germanic languages, the -n- has disappeared and Old Norse has √∫- (e.g. √∫-d√°ins-akr), which became u in Danish and Norwegian, o in Swedish, and √≥ in Icelandic. =Confusion of privative and non-privative in English = Many words introduced into the English from the Latin start with the prefix in-. While often, it is a privative, it is not always so. Even if it is a privative, the meaning may be unclear to those who are not familiar with the word. The following three examples illustrate that. Example 1: inexcusable The prefix is a privative and the word means the opposite of excusable that is, \\"unable to be excused, not excusable\\". Example 2: invaluable That is also a privative but it does not mean \\"not valuable, not precious\\". While today valuable is a synonym for precious, it originally meant \\"able to be given a value\\". The meaning of invaluable hinges upon this original meaning and thus means \\"of very great value\\" or literally \\"value cannot be estimated (because it is so great)\\", similar to priceless but dissimilar to worthless. Example 3: inflammable A naive reader may incorrectly interpret that as \\"not flammable\\". However, the word contains not a privative but a locative and flammable (the newer word in English by 300 years), rather than being the opposite of inflammable means the same thing. The prefix in- arises from the Latin for \\"in, inside, within\\" and inflammable derives from the Latin root inflammƒÅre meaning \\"able to be set alight, able to kindle a flame\\". Since at least the 1920s, there have been calls to stop using inflammable and substitute it exclusively with flammable to avoid the confusion that occurs even by native English-speakers. Privative suffixes Some languages have privative suffixes; -less is an example in English. Further examples are -t(a)lan or -t(e)len in Hungarian or -ton/-t√∂n in Finnish (non-IE languages).

Also known as the \\"Wise Wife of Keith\\",Thomas Thomson, The historie and life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), p. 241. Sampson was involved in the North Berwick witch trials in the later part of the sixteenth century. Background Sampson lived at Nether Keith, a part of the Barony of Keith, East Lothian, Scotland. She was considered to have healing powers and acted as a midwife. The indictment against her indicated that she was a widow, with children. In the spring of 1590, James VI returned from Copenhagen after marrying Anne of Denmark, daughter of the King of Denmark-Norway. The Danish court at that time was greatly perplexed by witchcraft and the black arts, and this must have impressed King James. The voyage back from Denmark was beset by storms. In the following months a witch hunt began in Denmark, started by the Danish admiral Peder Munk. One of its victims was Anna Koldings, who gave the names of five women, including Mail, the wife of the burgomaster of Copenhagen. The women confessed they had been guilty of witchcraft in raising storms that threatened Anne of Denmark's voyage, and sent devils to climb up the keel of her ship. In September 1590 two women were burnt as witches at Kronborg. James decided to set up his own tribunal in Scotland.Ethel Carleton Williams, Anne of Denmark (London, 1970), pp. 38-9. The story of the arrest, trial and confessions of Agnes Sampson and the others accused of witchcraft is known from versions found in a pamphlet printed in London in 1591, the Newes from Scotland, and from contemporary letters and trial records.Newes from Scotland (Roxburghe Club: London, 1816). Arrest and torture By the autumn of 1590, Scotland was aflame with witch hunts, and many of those sent to trial were questioned by the King himself. Agnes Sampson was accused by Gillis Duncan and arrested along with others, and questioned regarding her role in the storm raising. She was put to the torture and confessed and her body was shaved to reveal a \\"privy mark\\" or witches' mark. These events were described in the 1591 London publication Newes from Scotland: > This aforeaside Agnis Sampson which was the elder Witch, was taken and > brought to Haliruid house before the Kings Maiestie and sundry other of the > nobility of Scotland, where she was straitly examined, but all the > perswasions which the Kings maiestie vsed to her with ye rest of his > counsell, might not prouoke or induce her to confesse any thing, but stood > stiffely in the deniall of all that was laide to her charge: whervpon they > caused her to be conueied awaye to prison, there to receiue such torture as > hath been lately prouided for witches in that country: and forasmuch as by > due examination of witchcraft and witches in Scotland, it hath latelye beene > found that the Deuill dooth generallye marke them with a privie marke, by > reason the Witches haue confessed themselues, that the Diuell dooth lick > them with his tung in some priuy part of their bodie, before hee dooth > receiue them to be his seruants, which marke commonly is giuen them vnder > the haire in some part of their bodye, wherby it may not easily be found out > or seene, although they be searched: and generally so long as the marke is > not seene to those which search them, so long the parties that hath the > marke will neuer confesse any thing.

According to the Newes from Scotland, Agnes Sampson confessed to causing the storm that drowned Jane Kennedy by sinking a dead cat, to which her companions had attached parts of dead man, into the sea near Leith. The same charm raised the storm that had threatened the king on his return from Denmark.Newes from Scotland (Roxburghe Club: London, 1816), sig. B3. The English ambassador Robert Bowes wrote in December 1590 that Sampson had confessed and mentioned attempts to obtain the king's shirt or other personal linen in order to work charms. On 27 January she confessed that the Devil had offered to help her and her children because she was a poor widow. The Devil appeared to her as a black man, a dog, or a hay rick. She had attended a witch's convent at North Berwick with her son-in-law. They collected bones and powdered them for charms against the pains of childbirth. She said that Bowes was \\"a little black and fat man with black hair\\", who had given the accused gold in a cellar while James VI was in Denmark to make a charm with a toad to hurt the king and make him infertile. Bowes noted that this personal description was inaccurate.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 461. Sampson said she had made a wax image of her father-in-law for a woman who complained about his behaviour.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 430 no. 505, 464-7 no. 526. According to the pamphlet Newes from Scotland, Agnes Sampson was interviewed by James VI, who was sceptical of the material in the confessions, and she told him things about the conversation he had on wedding night with Anne of Denmark, that she could not have known: > Item, the saide Agnis Sampson confessed before the Kings Maiestie sundrye > thinges which were so miraculous and strange, as that his Maiestie saide > they were all extreame lyars, wherat she answered, she would not wishe his > Maiestie to suppose her woords to be false, but rather to beleeue them, in > that she would discouer such matter vnto him as his maiestie should not any > way doubt off.

Biography =Early life= Burton was born in Edinburgh to John Hill Burton, a lawyer and amateur historian, who had written two books on economics, which had received attention in Japan. His mother was Katherine, daughter of Dr Cosmo Innes, one of Scotland's foremost amateur photographers. He was also a childhood friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who turned to him for background information for The Engineer's Thumb; Doyle's book, The Firm of Girdlestone, is dedicated to Burton. London Telegraph, 8 May 2006 Conan Doyle lodged with Burton's aunt Mary while a student in Edinburgh. Burton studied at Edinburgh Collegiate School, but instead of going on to university, from 1873 he signed up for a five-year apprenticeship with the innovative hydraulic and mechanical engineers Brown Brothers & Co. Ltd at the Rosebank Ironworks in Edinburgh. Rising to become chief draftsman, he left the firm in 1879 to enter partnership with his uncle Cosmo InnesWhen Cosmo Innes was in government service for the British India as chief engineer, he has sent his 3 assistant surveyors to Japan's Public Works by request of his friend Colin Alexander McVean in London designing water systems. In 1881 he became Resident Engineer to the London Sanitary Protection Association. =Career in Japan= In May 1887 he was invited by the Meiji government to assume the post of first unofficial professor of sanitary engineering at Tokyo Imperial University (he lectured as an engineer), at a time when the country was dealing with several serious epidemics, notably cholera. His appointment was unusual in that Burton was largely self-educated, and did not come with the impressive educational or professional credentials that many of his contemporaries had. It is not known who recommended Burton to the Japanese government, or what inspired him to leave a promising career in London for what he believed to be a temporary assignment in Japan. He met Nagai Kyuichiro, an officer of the Sanitary Department of the Japan Home Ministry and of the Tokyo Imperial University, while Nagai was staying in London. Nagai invited him to Japan. Burton helped train a number of prominent water system engineers for nine years, and became the sole consultant engineer for the Sanitary Department of the Home Ministry, planning and managing the water and drainage systems of numerous cities, including Tokyo. His achievements are considered the starting point of Japan's environmental and sanitary engineering. The sand filtration system he built in Shimonoseki city, Yamaguchi prefecture is still functional today and produces water so pure it is bottled with Burton's picture on the label. Brits at Their Best Burton also designed Japan's first skyscraper, Ry≈çunkaku in Asakusa, Tokyo. This 12-story, 225-foot (68.58-metre) tall structure was the tallest building in Tokyo at the time it opened in 1890. This octagonal building gained iconic status as a symbol of modern Japan, and boasted Japan's first electric lift. It was damaged beyond repair in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. Burton was a noted photographer and made a substantial contribution to Japan's photographic history. He published several technical works on photography, and made a contribution in the introduction of Japanese culture to the West by sending his own photographs to various London magazines. He also did much to publicise the works of fledgling Japanese photographers in Britain. Burton worked with seismologist John Milne in co writing and co photographing a book that recorded the disastrous great earthquake of 1891. The book illustrated the plight of the Japanese people and the impact of an earthquake on their environment, in dramatic images that were printed by Ogawa KazumasaOgawa Kazumasa, Japanese PhotographerThe Great Earthquake in Japan 1891 Milne, John, Burton, W. K. & Ogawa, K Publisher: Lane, Crawford & Co., Yokohama 1893, with 30 Plates In addition to photographing the 1891 Mino‚ÄìOwari earthquake, Burton also photographed Japanese costumes and customs, Hakone, Mount Fuji, and scenes from daily life. He was closely associated with Japanese photographer and collotype printer Ogawa Kazumasa. With Ogawa, Burton was a founding member of the Japan Photographic Society, Japan's first organisation for amateur photographers. In 1896, after his term at Tokyo Imperial University expired, Burton went to Japanese Formosa as an engineer, where he made outstanding contributions to improving the sanitation systems in Taiwanese cities under the authority of the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan. He then returned to Japan proper in 1899. Burton began cohabition with a Japanese woman, Orakawa Matsu from 1892. On 19 May 1894, he married her at a ceremony at the British Consulate in Tokyo. Burton had a daughter (Tamako) with another woman.„Éê„É´„Éà„É≥ÂÖàÁîü„ÄÅÊòéÊ≤ª„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨„ÇíÈßÜ„Åë„ÇãÔºÅ (2016) ‚Äì Âπ≥Âá°Á§æ Burton had intended to return with his family to Scotland to meet his mother, but suddenly fell ill from a liver infection and died on 5 August 1899 at the age of 43.

Background Petersburg, Virginia, was the supply center for the Confederate capital of Richmond, and was under siege by Union forces under the command of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Petersburg was supplied by rail along three remaining lines, the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad; the South Side Railroad, which reached to Lynchburg in the west; and the Weldon Railroad, also called the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, which led to Weldon, North Carolina, and the Confederacy's only remaining major port, Wilmington, North Carolina.

This led to a series of raids that destroyed of rail track and culminated in the Battle of Staunton River Bridge on June 25, where the raiders were defeated and began a retreat back to Union positions. Since the outset of the raid, the Union force had been pursued by Confederate Maj. Gen. W.H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee.

On June 28, the Union cavalry crossed the Nottoway River and reached the Stony Creek Depot on the Weldon Railroad. Here, they were attacked by Confederate Maj. Gen.

By nightfall, Kautz and Wilson ordered their forces to fall back in an attempt to reach Reams Railway Station to the north. During the retreat, a large number of slaves who had been accompanying the Union forces were left behind.

It was designed by Italdesign Giugiaro under Fabrizio Giugiaro, Giorgetto Giugiaro's son. The 2015 Ford Mustang takes many design cues from the concept car.  Styling  In 2005, Fabrizio Giugiaro, the styling director of Italdesign Giugiaro, went to Ford to design a future concept inspired by the fifth generation Ford Mustang. This follows the pattern of Giorgetto Giugiaro, who was instrumental in designing the 1965 Bertone Mustang, as well as the Chevrolet Corvette Moray. It is the younger automobile designer's interpretation of European styling on the 2005 version of the American pony car. Italdesign Giugiaro changed the styling and design of both the interior as well as the exterior. The final concept of the vehicle is more compact and tapered with a smaller rear overhang, but is wider by at the front, and by at the rear. A single pane forms the windshield as well as the roof, which is made from a type of crystal that filters out all UV rays, yet does not polarize visible light. The doors are touch operated and when opened raise from the A-pillar at a 45 degree angle, similar to the classic Lamborghini's scissor doors. Inside, the interior is trimmed with aluminum and leather. The dashboard, door panels, dials and knobs, instrument cluster, as well as gear lever have been completely redesigned. The car also utilizes reverse cameras on both doors in place of conventional side view mirrors. New periscope-style air conditioning vents, along with a new seat trim, harkens to the pony car‚Äôs name with furred horse hides.  Engineering  The Giugiaro Mustang is powered by the 4.6 L V8 from the Mustang GT, but receives additional power from a twin-screw supercharger. The engine is tuned by Italdesign Giugiaro, fitted with fuel injectors from the Ford GT, and has a larger air intake with mass air meter and a conical air filter. Exhaust flow is improved using an X-pipe and Ford Racing mufflers. The engine produces over at of boost from the supercharger. The Giugiaro Mustang is equipped with a custom Ford Racing handling package, featuring new shock absorbers, lower springs, and thicker sway bars. These changes also lower the ride height by .

Together with all other titles of nobility in Germany, it was abolished with the 1919 Weimar Constitution.  Principality of Leiningen at Amorbach  From 1560 until 1725 Hardenburg Castle was the main seat of the branch. After its partial destruction during the Nine Years' War the residence was moved to Bad Durkheim. In 1801, this line was deprived of its lands on the left bank of the Rhine, namely Hardenburg, Dagsburg and Durkheim, by France, but in 1803 it received the secularized Amorbach Abbey as an ample compensation for these losses. The complete titles of Carl Friedrich Wilhelm, 1st Prince of Leiningen were Imperial Prince of Leiningen, Count palatine of Mosbach, Count of D√ºren, Lord of Miltenberg, Amorbach, Bischofsheim, Boxberg, Sch√ºpf and Lauda. A few years later, the short-lived Principality of Leiningen at Amorbach was mediatized, and its territory is now included mainly in Baden, but partly in Bavaria and in Hesse. Amorbach Abbey is still today the seat of the Prince of Leiningen. The former hunting lodge Waldleiningen Castle at Mudau is now run as a hospital by the family.

After his death in 1814, the princess married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, a younger son of George III of the United Kingdom, by whom she became the mother of Queen Victoria. The Queen's half- siblings, Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen and Princess Feodora remained close to their half-sister. The fourth prince, Ernst, pursued a career in the British Royal Navy; his marriage to Princess Marie of Baden, a descendant of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, meant that their children were in the line of succession to the British throne, though rather far down the list. The sixth prince, Karl, married Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia, daughter of Princess Victoria Melita who was in turn daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, Queen Victoria's second son. As a result, their descendants today occupy places higher up the British line of succession, in the early hundreds. In 1991, the seventh prince, Emich, disinherited his eldest son, the Hereditary Prince Karl Emich, after he married his second wife, Dr Gabriele Thyssen, on May 24 of that same year. The disinheritance was upheld by the German courts, and so on Emich's death later that year, he was succeeded by his second son, Andreas, who has been the eighth prince from that time. He married Princess Alexandra of Hanover.

A large fold covers the top portion of the tympanum, which is visible. The toe pads are large, the feet are webbed, and the hands are one-third webbed. The only physical feature which can distinguish the Centralian tree frog from the Australian green tree frog is numerous white spots on the dorsal surface.

The frog will hide during the day beneath rocks, and hunt and mate during the cooler night. Its call is a slow barking call, similar to the Australian green tree frog. It inhabits the MacDonnell Ranges in central Australia. This confined distribution is not inhabited by the Australian green tree frog, which allows easy identification.

Biography Born in Pleasantville, Pennsylvania, Palmer attended Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania.Roth, Mitchel P. et al. (1997). Historical Dictionary of War Journalism. p. 230. The New York Press hired Palmer in 1895 as its London correspondent; and this opportunity evolved into a long career. =War correspondent= Palmer (back row, fourth from left) with Western military attach√©s and war correspondents after the Battle of Shaho (1904) Palmer's 50 years as a war correspondent began when he was sent to cover the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 for the New York World and for Collier's magazine. He then covered the gold rush in northwestern Canada. The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899‚Äì1902) provided an opportunity for him to cross the Pacific bound for Manila. In 1900, Palmer went to China to cover the Boxer Rebellion (1900); and then he was sent to cover the Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) in South Africa. Then the prospect of military conflict in Manchuria brought him back to China to cover the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905) for the New York Globe. The New York Times sent Palmer to cover the Balkan War in 1912. In 1914, Palmer was arrested in Mexico City while covering the Tampico Affair (1914) and the United States occupation of Veracruz for Everybody's Magazine. =World Wars= General John Pershing persuaded him to take on the task of press accreditation for the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). In this period, he was accorded the rank of Colonel. Palmer subsequently became the first war correspondent to win the U.S. Army's Distinguished Service Medal. Between World War I and World War II, Palmer wrote thirty-one books, including Our Greatest Battle, based on his World War I experiences. In his books, he provided an analysis of the future impact of weapons and strategies he had seen, and soon after the end of World War I predicted that a second world war was on the horizon. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Princeton University in 1935. Palmer also wrote for the North American Newspaper Alliance in World War II, submitting from London and then Paris at least through April 1945.

Established in 1869, it was sold off to the private sector twenty years later. Some of the infrastructure of the Horonai Railway remains in use today, as the Temiya Line and Muroran Main Line, connecting Minami-Otaru Station and Iwamizawa Station; these began operations in the 1880s. History The Hokkaid≈ç Colonization Office was established in 1869, as the new Meiji government sought to take advantage of the natural resources of the island. The American engineer Horace Capron, invited to Hokkaid≈ç by the government for this purpose, determined the presence of a sizable coal deposit in the upper reaches of the Horonai River. Another American engineer, Benjamin Smith Lyman, was invited to plan the establishment and operations of a new coal mine. Capron suggested the construction of rails from Horonai to the port of Muroran, as part of a plan to ship the coal from there; meanwhile, Lyman's plan involved the construction of rails instead to Horomuibuto (today Ebetsu), and intended to use a system of river boats on the Ishikari River for shipping the coal to Otaru, where they could be transferred to a larger ship. The government decided Lyman's plan was cheaper, and in March 1878, they invited yet another American engineer, to begin land surveys in preparation for construction. Crawford quickly determined that much of the land, being swampy, was not suitable for rails, stations, or other buildings, and that the river would freeze over in winter, rendering this shipping plan feasible for only around 150 days each year. His suggestion to extend the rail lines from Horomui Futoshi to Otaru, and to build rails straight to the piers, was approved by the Settlement Envoy, Kuroda Kiyotaka. Construction began in January 1880; a test run was done in October from Temiya to Zenibako, and regular operations began at the end of November, running from Temiya to Sapporo. While the first railways in Japan, in the Keihin and Hanshin regions, were designed on English models, this was the first railway in Japan to be designed by Americans. Though the American engineers suggested the use of gauge track, as was standard in the United States, Kuroda thought ahead and it was decided that use of the British standard of would allow the Hokkaid≈ç system to be compatible with, and perhaps in the future connected to, the Honsh≈´ network. Fifteen kilogram per metre iron rails were used, with a minimum of wood and gravel on the rail bed. Though the Temiya factory and railyard were established by now, the stations in Otaru (now Minami-Otaru Station) and Sapporo were still temporary constructs; Asari, Asakawa, and Kotoni Stations were made \\"flag stops\\", in the American style. Two steam locomotives were imported from H. K. Porter, Inc along with eight passenger cars from Harlan and Hollingsworth, both American firms. These locomotives, dubbed Benkei and Yoshitsune, were the first of what would later be termed the 7100 series of locomotives. Each locomotive in the series would be named after a figure from Japanese history. The following year, Emperor Meiji made his way to Hokkaid≈ç on his national tour, rode the line from Otaru to Sapporo, and gave his approval. In February 1882, the Colonization Office was abolished, and the railway and coal mine came under the jurisdiction of the construction bureau. The Sapporo-Ebetsu route was opened provisionally in June, and by November the line was completely operational from Temiya to Horonai. The official opening ceremonies were held on September 17, 1883, and were attended by members of the royal family, the military, and Inoue Masaru, chief of the Railroad Office. Passenger service was run for free to the local citizens for the entire day. However, it was soon decided that the railway was not doing well. In the six years from 1880 to 1885, it produced roughly one-third of the anticipated profit for that period. The construction bureau turned over control of the railroad, and the coal mine, to the Hokkaid≈ç Government Office in January 1886. The following year, the two were split into separate offices, and the railroad began to be administered from Temiya instead of Sapporo, but before the end of the year, the Horonai Railway came to be contracted by the head of the Rails & Coal Mine Office, Murata Tsutsumi, to aid in the completion of the Ikunshunbetsu Line. This operation would not be profitable for the Horonai Railway, but Murata took these risks on himself, and explained to the Hokkaid≈ç Government Office that this work was necessary in order to get the Ikushunbetsu coal mine operational, and that initial expenditures were necessary in such a venture. He hoped the expenses could be compensated for somewhat by the rents and taxes paid by the citizenry. Murata's scheme was approved in 1888, and he formed the Hokuy≈´sha (Northern Property Company) to manage the railroad contracts. For the next fifteen years, the Hokuy≈´sha paid the Horonai Railroad 5000 yen every year in return for using their trains and rails, and took on the responsibility of maintenance and all other fees; this revived the railroad's revenues. The route from Horonaibuto (today Mikasa Station) to Ikushunbetsu began operations in 1886, and though coal prices dropped soon afterwards, this contract and the ensuing relationship between the Railroad and Murata's ventures helped recoup all the costs of the initial construction. Steam locomotives The Horonai railroad operated eight steam locomotives: six of the 7100 series, and two, called \\"Murata No. 1\\" and \\"Murata No. 2,\\" of the 7170 series.

It was composed by Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, (1560‚Äì1666 AD) one of the celebrated Sanskrit poets in Kerala. Even though the Narayaneeyam was completed as early as 1586 AD, it appeared in print only after more than 250 years. The Bhagavata Purana is a major Hindu scripture consisting of about 18,000 verses, mainly devoted to the worship of Krishna.  The Poem  The nƒÅrƒÅya·πáƒ´yam (pronunciation IPA: [n…ëÀêr…ëÀêj…ô…≥iÀêj…ôm]) condenses the Bhagavata Purana into 1034 verses, divided into one hundred dasakam, or cantos. The work occupies a very high place in Sanskrit literature, both because of the intense devotional fervour of the verses, and because of their extraordinary literary merit. The nƒÅrƒÅyanƒ´yam is one of the most popular religious texts in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and devout Hindus often recite it together in festivals and groups. NƒÅrƒÅyanƒ´yam is the story of Lord Narayana. It is a work consisting of 1035 slokas or verses, divided into 100 dasakams or chapters, each dasakam consisting of approximately 10 slokas. It is a condensed version of Bhagavata Purana, which consists of 18,000 slokas authored by Veda Vyasa. It is said that the work has the blessings of Lord Krishna or Guruvayoorappan, the presiding Deity of Guruvayur. Narayaneeyam narrates a series of episodes from the Bhagavata Purana, choosing the most pious of the lot. The incarnations of Vishnu are traced with piety, Bhattathiri transforms the episodes into solemn prayers, pouring out his soul in total supplication before the Lord. The final dasaka, Kesadipaada Varnanam, embodies top-to-toe picture of little Krishna in all grace and glory. Both as a poem and as a devotional hymn, Narayaneeyam occupies a very high place in Sanskrit literature. Narayaneeyam is the masterpiece of Melputhur and is the most widely read of all his works. The poet depicts the image of Lord Guruvayurappan, in exemplary terms - \\"Sammohanam Mohanal Kantham Kanthinidhanathopi, Madhuram Madhurya Dhuryadapi, Soundaryotharathopi Sundaratharam\\" The \\"Parayana\\" of Narayaneeyam is believed to possess the wonderful power of healing afflictions, both mental and physical, of the devotees. The \\"Nithyaparayana‚Äù of Narayaneeyam will enable the devotees to attain \\" Ayurarogyasoukhyam‚Äù. Narayaneeya Sapthaham ( the recitation of Narayaneeyam and explaining the meaning to the public) is conducted in Guruvayur temple by Devaswom on the Narayaneeya Dinam and by others as offerings. It is done for seven consecutive days from early morning till 6:10 p.m. Narayaneeya Sapthaham has started in Guruvayur in the early 1950s. It takes about 5 hours to read the slokas and about 45 hours for explaining the slokas. The day on which Narayaneeyam was completed, 28th Vrichikam, is celebrated by the Devaswom as Narayaneeyam day. Discourses and debates on Narayaneeyam written by Melpathur take place. Special functions are held at Melpathur Illapparambu also. The author Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was born about the year 1560 in a village near the temple of TirunƒÅvƒÅya in Malappuram district, Kerala. He composed the Narayanƒ´yam at the age of 27. Other monumental works by Bhattathiri include a treatise on Sanskrit Grammar, entitled Prakriyasarvasva, a work similar to the Siddhanta Kaumudi, but written earlier. It is said that Bha·π≠·π≠oji Dƒ´k·π£ita, the author of the Siddhanta Kaumudi, on hearing about Bhattathiri, set out for Kerala to meet him, but had to return disappointed on hearing on the way that Bhattathiri had died. Bhattathiri composed many other devotional hymns, as well as a work on Purva- Mimamsa entitled Manameyodaya, and panegyrics in praise of his royal patrons. It is believed that he lived till the age of 105. Origin legend of the Narayaniyam The people of Kerala worship Krishna in His deity form as Guruvayurappan in the temple town of Guruvayur. According to local legends, Bhattathiri had a Guru by the name of Achyuta pisharadi, who fell victim to a severe attack of paralysis, and suffered unbearable pain. Bhattathiri desired to find a cure for his master and fervently prayed for the disease to be transferred to himself, freeing his Guru from suffering. According to the legend, Lord Krishna granted Bhattathiri his wish, and he soon became crippled. Once, when Bhattathiri, unable to move, was carried into the Guruvayur temple, he met Tunchath Ezhuthachan, an eminent Malayalam poet of the time. Ezhuthachan advised Bhattathiri that he could be cured if he \\"began his treatment with fish\\". The disciples of Bhattathiri who heard this were shocked because Bhattathiri was a devout Brahmin and therefore a vegetarian who would consider it sinful to eat fish. Bhattathiri however understood what Ezhuthachan really meant - that he would be cured if he could compose a hymn glorifying the incarnations of Lord Krishna beginning with the fish incarnation, known as Matsya. Accordingly, he started composing the Narayaniyam. It is said that he would recite one dasakam, consisting of ten verses, every day. The local legend says that on the hundredth day he had a vision of the Lord, and rendered a graphic description of this form, after which he was immediately cured of his disease. The Cakorasandesa, which was earlier than Narayaneeyam, also refers to rheumatic patients going to the Guruvayur temple. Worship in the Guruvayur temple is considered to be sure remedy for all diseases.The contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit Literature; K. Kunjunni Raja; University of Madras 1980; pages 119 to 152 Narayaneeya Sahasranama Narayaneeya Sahasranama is a condensed form of Narayaneeyam consisting of 1000 names of Vishnu. It is carefully created collections, of all the namas (names) of Vishnu's Avataras, that appear sequentially and chapter-wise in the Narayaneeyam. It was composed by Ayyappan Kariyat, an Ayurveda vaidya.

The Turkish Armed Forces has fought Kurdish rebellions in Turkish Kurdistan from the 1920s until the present day. Turkey joined NATO in 1952, during the Cold War. The military has taken power twice, in 1960 and 1980.  War of Independence  Liberation of Izmir in 1922 effectively sealed the Turkish victory and ended the Turkish War of Independence. The Turkish revolutionaries rejected the Treaty of S√®vres (1920), which had left the Ottoman government in control of substantially less of Anatolia than modern Turkey controls. Following the victory of Atat√ºrk's forces in the War of Independence, the Treaty of S√®vres was substituted with the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), which granted international recognition to the government of Ankara, rather than the Ottoman government in Istanbul.  World War II  In 1938, the Turkish Army at peacetime strength consisted of 174,000 soldiers and 20,000 officers forming 11 army corps, 23 divisions, one armoured brigade, 3 cavalry brigades and 7 frontier commands.Selim Deringil: Turkish Foreign Policy During the Second World War: An 'Active' Neutrality, Cambridge University Press, 2004, , page 33. Like most nations at the time it was ill- equipped with primarily World War I era weapons.Douglas Arthur Howard: The history of Turkey, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, , page 111. The rifles used were a mixture including Mausers, Mannlichers, Lee‚ÄìEnfields, Martinis, Lebels and others. As late as February 1940, the British Foreign Office noted: \\"The Turkish Army is very short of rifles and has asked us to supply 150,000.\\" Curtiss Falcon CW 22 aircraft, circa 1940s The Turkish Air Force had 131 first line aircraft in 1937, of which only half were relatively modern. Turkey hoped to increase the size of its fleet to 300 by 1938. Although Turkey had 300 trained pilots, the majority of them would be rated with moderate ability to fly in bad weather in a Western European Air Force. In 1942, Ernest Phillips in his work Hitler's last Hope: A factual survey of the Middle East warzone and Turkey's vital strategic position admitted: \\"If the Germans were to stage an all out offensive in this area, they could bring more planes into the air than the Turks could even gather, and if we were to send too many from Libya to help Turkey, the weakness there would be such that we should be in difficulties on the other side of the Suez.\\"Ernest Phillips, Hitler's last Hope: A factual survey of the Middle East warzone and Turkey's vital strategic position, 1942, page 54. At the beginning of World War II the Turkish Air Force consisted of some 370 aircraft of all types, 450 pilots and 8,000 men.William Green, John Fricker: The air forces of the world: their history, development, and present strength, Macdonald, 1958, page 281.

One of them was shot down by a German plane during a training flight in British air space, the rest died in accidents. The daughter of former Air Forces Commander Emin Alpkaya, who had been sent to Britain for training during the war, stated she found something amazing while examining her father's wartime diaries.

There were some allegations that Turkish pilots, who had been in Britain to get training during World War II, joined missions which bombed Berlin. However officials of the Turkish General Staff asserted that their pilots were never assigned in active aerial warfare and bombing flights.Turkish pilots never assigned in bombardment flights during World War II, The Free Library, October 23, 2009.

World War II broke out in the first year of the ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º presidency, and both the Allies and the Axis started to put pressure on ƒ∞n√∂n√º to bring Turkey into the war on their respective sides. The Germans sent Franz von Papen to Ankara, while Winston Churchill secretly met with ƒ∞n√∂n√º inside a train wagon near Adana on January 30, 1943. ƒ∞n√∂n√º later met with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Second Cairo Conference on December 4‚Äì6, 1943. Turkey remained neutral until the final stages of World War II and tried to maintain an equal distance between both the Axis and the Allies until February 1945, when Turkey entered the war on the side of the Allies against Germany and Japan. Until 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill thought that continued Turkish neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis up to the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. Roosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky. ƒ∞n√∂n√º knew very well the hardships which his country had suffered during 11 years of incessant war between 1911 and 1922 and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. ƒ∞n√∂n√º also wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the United States and the United Kingdom would stand beside Turkey in case of a Soviet invasion of the Turkish Straits after the war. In April 1944, Turkey halted its sales of Chromite to Germany, and broke off relations in August. Turkey declared war on the Axis powers in February, 1945, after the Allies made its invitation to the inaugural meeting of the United Nations (along with the invitations of several other nations) conditional on full belligerency. No Turkish troops ever saw combat.  Korean War  The commander of the Turkish Brigade, Tahsin Yazƒ±cƒ± receiving a Silver Star during the Korean War. During the Cold War, Turkey participated in the Korean War as a member state of the United Nations, suffering 731 deaths in combat. The fear of a Soviet invasion and Stalin's unconcealed desire to control the Turkish Straits eventually led Turkey to give up its principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO on February 18, 1952. Following NATO membership, Turkey initiated a comprehensive modernization program for its Armed Forces. Cyprus In July 1974, the Turkish Armed Forces intervened against a coup in Cyprus, organized by EOKA B and led by Nikos Sampson who ousted the democratically elected Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios III in order to establish Enosis (Union) between Greece and Cyprus. The coup was backed by the Greek military junta in Athens. On 20 July 1974 the Turkish Army invaded the island from the north, landing in Pente Mili beach, near Keryneia. The operations (named Attila I and II) lasted until August and resulted in 37% of Cyprus territory coming under Turkish military control.Military operations during the Invasion of Cyprus (1974) Turkey still maintains troops in Cyprus, since a political solution could not yet be achieved, and since many members of the Turkish Cypriot community fear a return to the intercommunal violence which occurred between 1963 and 1974.Cyprus Intercommunal Violence Although according to Turkey the invasion was a response to the coup d'etat, it violated international law, according to the European Court of Human Rights . The invasion not only violated basic Human Rights, but also the internationally fundamental prohibition of offensive war. Recent Towards the end of the 1980s, a restructuring and modernization process has been initiated by the Turkish Armed Forces, which still continues today. The final goal of Turkey is to produce indigenous military equipment and to become increasingly self-sufficient in terms of military technologies. =PKK conflict= =2011 Libyan civil war= Turkey's armed forces participated in the NATO-led military intervention and no-fly zone in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi's government troops.

Christopher Wyvill (1740‚Äì1822) was an English cleric and landowner, a political reformer who inspired the formation of the Yorkshire Association movement in 1779. The American Revolutionary War had forced the government of Lord North to increase taxation. Frustrated with government profligacy, Wyvill and the gentry of Yorkshire called for a package of 'economical reforms': cuts in government spending and patronage, annual parliaments and an increase in the number of county seats in parliament. Wyvill's cause was taken up by the Rockingham Whig opposition, culminating in the carrying of Dunning's motion in 1780. Some moderate reforms were implemented by the Rockingham-led administration of 1782. William Pitt the Younger raised a number of issues surrounding parliamentary reform in opposition to the Fox-North Coalition in 1783, but his proposal failed to gain the necessary support. In the wake of the French Revolution, Wyvill's platform came to be seen as moderate. Its influence can be detected in the later Great Reform Act and Chartist movement in the nineteenth century. Early life He was born in Edinburgh in 1740, the son of Edward Wyvill (died 1791), supervisor of excise there, by Christian Catherine, daughter of William Clifton of Edinburgh. Sir Christopher Wyvill, 3rd Baronet, of Constable Burton, was his great-great-grandfather. Christopher Wyvill matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge in 1756, obtaining an honorary degree of LL.B. in 1764. In 1774 he came in for the large landed estates of the family in Yorkshire and elsewhere, and the mansion at Constable Burton, the building of which he completed from his cousin, Sir Marmaduke's, designs. He had some years previously taken orders and been presented through his cousin's influence to the rectory of Black Notley in Essex, which he continued to hold and administer by means of a curate, down to 22 September 1806. Debarred from entering the House of Commons, Wyvill began to take a prominent part in county politics. The Yorkshire Association In 1779 Wyvill was appointed secretary of the Yorkshire Association, which had for its main objects to shorten the duration of parliaments, and to equalise the representation. He shortly became chairman of the association. Wyvill drew up a circular letter enunciating its political sentiments, and took a leading part in drawing up the Yorkshire petition presented to parliament on 8 February 1780. A number of moderate Whigs, including Horace Walpole, regarded Wyvill's manifesto as chimerical, Walpole writing that it was full of \\"obscurity, bombast, and futility\\". Sir Cecil Wray wrote in a similar vein, and Rockingham wanted to know if the Association had ever considered the practicability of the annual parliaments which they recommended. Wyvill's contention was that the long American war was due primarily, not to the wish of the people, but to the votes of the members of the close boroughs. The Association had the sympathy of politicians including Pitt and Charles James Fox. A committee under Wyvill was appointed to continue the pressure by correspondence, and the example of Yorkshire was followed by other counties, 25 in all. In the period 1779 to 1781, when there was a delegate conference, the movement gained a broad base. Supporters included John Baynes, Sir Robert Bernard, Newcome Cappe, John Fountayne, Sir James Grant, Thomas Brand Hollis, Sir James Innes-Ker, John Lee, Gamaliel Lloyd, George Montagu, 4th Duke of Manchester, John Smyth, Charles Stanhope, and William Johnson Temple.Their articles in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

R. Christie.Richard Pares, 'Review: George III, Lord North, and the People, 1779-80 by Herbert Butterfield', The English Historical Review, Vol. 65, No. 257 (Oct., 1950), pp. 526-29I. R. Christie, Stress and Stability in Late Eighteenth-Century Britain: Reflections on the British Avoidance of Revolution (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984), pp. 47‚Äì48. With the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, however, and the fall of Lord North, the Association disintegrated. Wyvill's supporters dwindled, to a small group including Sir George Savile, and Sir Charles Turner, who spoke of the House of Commons as resembling a parcel of thieves that had stolen an estate and were afraid of letting any person look into their title-deeds for fear of losing it. Wyvill strongly disapproved of the subsequent war with France, to which he attributed industrial distress in Yorkshire, and this completed his alienation from Pitt. In 1793 Wyvill published in pamphlet form correspondence that had passed between them. Some supplementary letters appeared at Newcastle in a further brochure, and both had a large sale. Wyvill attached himself to the extreme Whig opposition, and he defended in a short pamphlet (early 1799) the secession of 1798. After Fox's death he gave his support to Samuel Whitbread and the peace-at-any-price party. Later life Wyvill returned in later life to his early enthusiasm in the cause of universal toleration; in particular he published on Catholic emancipation. He died at his seat, Burton Hall, near Bedale in the North Riding, on 8 March 1822, at the age of 82, and was buried at Spennithorne. A portrait was in the possession of his great-grandson, Marmaduke D'Arcy Wyvill M.P., of Constable Burton. Works Wyvill's correspondence with Pitt, and the political correspondence, are known as the \\"Wyvill Papers\\". Three volumes appeared in 1794‚Äì5 as Political Papers, chiefly respecting the Attempt of the County of York and other considerable Districts, commenced in 1779 ‚Ä¶ to effect a Reformation of the Parliament of Great Britain. Collected by the Rev. Christopher Wyvill, Chairman of the late Committee of Association (York). The preface is dated Burton Hall, 26 May 1794; in June 1802 Wyvill wrote the preface to a fourth volume, and the papers were eventually concluded in six. They show the proceedings of the Yorkshire Association, and the sympathy of others interested in the reform of Parliament. The correspondence includes letters between the chairman of the association and, among others, the Duke of Grafton, Lord Holland, Lansdowne, Lord Stanhope, Charles James Fox, Major John Cartwright, Capel Lofft, William Mason, William Strickland, Joseph Priestley, Richard Price, Bishop Richard Watson, Tom Paine, Granville Sharp, John Jebb, Sir George Savile, and Benjamin Franklin. Wyvill's writings were mostly shilling tracts, advocating radical reform. They include: * Thoughts on our Articles of Religion with respect to their Proposed Utility to the State, London, 1771, several editions. * Letters to the Committee of Belfast on the proposed Reformation of the Parliament of Ireland, 1782. * Summary Explanation of the Principles of Mr. Pitt's intended Bill for Amending the Representation of the People in Parliament, 1785. * A Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England, 1792, (a plea for reform, with some reflections on Edmund Burke). * A State of the Representation of the People of England on the Principles of Mr. Pitt in 1785, with an Annexed Sketch of Additional Propositions, York, 1793. * Considerations on the Twofold Mode of Elections adopted in France, 1804. * A Serious Address to all the Independent Electors of the United Kingdom, 1804. * A more extended Discussion in Favour of Liberty of Conscience Recommended, 1808. * Intolerance, the Disgrace of Christians, not the Fault of their Religion, 1808. * An Apology for the Petitioners for Liberty of Conscience, 1810. * Papers on Toleration, 1810 (several editions). * Political and Historical Arguments proving the Necessity of Parliamentary Reform, 2 vols. 1811. Family On 1 October 1773 Wyvill married his cousin Elizabeth, an heiress. She died in London on 22 July 1783, aged 68. He married, secondly, on 9 August 1787, Sarah, daughter of J. Codling, and by her had issue, with several daughters, three sons, all educated at Eton College: Marmaduke Wyvill (1791‚Äì1872), M.P. for York city from March 1820 to July 1830; Christopher Wyvill, a naval officer; and Edward, rector of Fingal, Yorkshire, who died on 15 September 1869.

Written by Will Pfeifer and pencilled by Pete Woods, the first issue was released April 25, 2007. Development A proposed story titled Amazons Attack! was originally slated as one of the mini-series that lead into the Infinite Crisis storyline. However, it was cancelled and never appeared. Though the projects share the same title, the planned Crisis tie-in was a completely different storyline that involved the U.S. military invading Themyscira.\\"Wonder Woman Preview,\\" Wizard #184 (February 2007), p. 87. Plot After leaving the DC Universe during the events of Infinite Crisis, the Amazons return to attack Washington, D.C. in retaliation for the American government's illegal detention of Wonder Woman. The Amazons teleport to Washington, D.C., where Diana is being held captive and tortured by the Department of Metahuman Affairs. The DMA wants the schematic plans for an Amazonian Purple Ray, wishing to deploy the device for their own uses. Diana refuses their demand. Led by the newly resurrected Hippolyta and her adviser Circe, the Amazons are joined by mythical creatures such as chimeras, winged horses, hydras and several cyclopes. The Amazon forces waste no time in murdering every male in sight, both adult and child, regardless of whether or not they are armed. Hippolyta is bent on destroying Man's World once and for all and emphasizes this point by slicing the head off of Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial. Two Amazons enter the White House and attempt to assassinate the President of the United States, but are stopped by Black Lightning. The Amazons are unaware that Wonder Woman's capture was orchestrated by Circe, and that Diana was rescued by Nemesis shortly before their invasion. While the Justice League and the U.S. military assemble to combat the assault, Wonder Woman comes face-to-face with her reborn mother. After realizing that Hippolyta is not an impostor, Diana tries reasoning with her mother to stop the war. Instead Hippolyta grows angry with her daughter, telling Diana that her rightful place is by her side. Diana leaves and finds Circe, who admits that her mobilization of the Amazon forces has been a ruse to force the destruction of the Amazon's homeland, Themyscira. Hippolyta overhears this conversation, and drives a battle spear through Circe's chest. Circe then disappears. Donna Troy also tries reasoning with Hippolyta to end the war: Hippolyta agrees to peace talks if Donna and her sister Diana both meet with her at the same time. However, the Amazons launch attacks on California and Kansas. The escalating attacks lead Amazon leaders Philipus and Artemis to question Hippolyta's motives. The severity of the situation causes the U.S. President to invoke the provisions of the McCarran Internal Security Act. Consequently, Wonder Girl's mother is held with other women at an internment camp. Cassie and Supergirl confront the soldiers guarding the camp, and are themselves threatened with arrest due to their ties to the Amazons. The Teen Titans arrive to attempt to stem the conflict, only to have Wonder Girl and Supergirl battle against them as well as the military before flying off to Washington D.C. to talk with Hippolyta. Cassie convinces the Amazon queen to engage in peace talks with the U.S. President. When Hippolyta agrees, Cassie promises to bring the U.S. leader to her.Teen Titans #48 During the fighting in Washington, D.C., Nemesis is stung by several giant venomous Stygian Killer Wasps native to Themyscira. Diana then calls upon Athena to transport her to her homeland in the hopes of retrieving an anti-venom for Nemesis. While on the island Athena refuses to return Diana back to Man's World and stops a missile from destroying her subject's home. Athena then attacks Diana for questioning her actions. Wonder Girl and Supergirl block the path of Air Force One. The President's guards are powerless against the two superheroes; he agrees to have the plane land. However, a party of Amazon warriors on winged horses attack Air Force One, causing it to crash-land; the President is severely injured. Wonder Girl and Supergirl realize their plan has gone awry; the Amazons press their attack on the downed survivors. Superman enters the fray: his forceful landing creates both a powerful shock- wave and a crater in the ground. He attempts to reason with the stunned Amazons, but just as the warriors are about to react to Superman's entreaties, a hidden troop of U.S. forces slaughter the Amazons with gunfire. Due to the high-tech weaponry deployed, Batman deduces that the off-Washington attacks are the work of an outside group. When he informs Wonder Woman of his discovery, she informs him that the group must be a rogue tribe of Bana Amazons. Batman leaves for Gotham, intending to dispatch Catwoman to infiltrate the group. Diana returns to Washington, D.C. with the anti-venom and supplies Nemesis with the cure. Using the Outsider Grace as a shield, the Banas then join forces with Hippolyta and her Amazons in battling the remaining U.S. military forces. Batman uses a spell given to him by Zatanna that renders Circe powerless for one hour. Wonder Woman confronts Circe; Hippolyta defends the sorceress. Wonder Woman confronts her mother about the decisions she has made. Since Circe is powerless, Hippolyta is no longer under anyone else's influence: her decisions are her own. Hippolyta throws down her weapon. Athena appears, displeased with what the Amazons have done and prepared to pass judgment. Circe is banished to Hades. Themyscira rises from the ocean. The Amazons disappear to parts unknown. Hippolyta is exiled to rule over an empty Themyscira. Athena watches events unfold, with the Greek gods in chains behind her. She reveals that the Amazons have been turned into regular mortal women scattered throughout the world with no memory of their past lives. On the final page of the series, it is revealed that Granny Goodness has imprisoned the Greek gods, incapacitated Athena, and stolen her identity. Reception In their review at IGN, Dan Phillips, Jesse Schedeen and Kevin Fuller described the series as \\"ill-conceived\\" and \\"awful\\". Kevin Powers, reviewing the title at Silver Bullet Comics, described it as \\"lackluster.\\" The level of displeasure among certain fans led some readers to mail their copies of Amazons Attack back to DC Comics editors.

Currently Artsakh Defence Army is around 15,000-20,000 well-trained and equipped officers and soldiers. It consists of infantry, tanks, artillery and anti- aircraft systems. Capture of Shusha The Capture of Shushi marked the first significant military victory by Armenian forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The battle was part of a larger territorial land dispute with the predominantly Armenian population in Karabakh who, aided by the neighboring Armenia, regained independence from the Republic of Azerbaijan. The battle took place in the strategically vital mountain town of Shusha (known as Shushi to Armenians) on the evening of May 8, 1992 and fighting swiftly concluded the following day after Armenian forces captured and drove out the defending Azeris. Armenian military commanders based in Nagorno-Karabakh's capital of Stepanakert had been contemplating the seizure of the town after a hail of Azeri military bombardment had begun shelling the city.Chorbajian, Levon (2001).

Bordering Armenia proper, the predominantly Armenian populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh had announced their declaration of independence from Azerbaijan in 1991 and fighting had taken place mostly in the enclave itself. Seeking to keep the territory under its rule, the Armenians of Karabakh were aided by Armenia itself in the form of logistics, supplies, volunteers and military weaponry. Kelbajar, only several kilometers from Armenia's border, comprised several dozen villages including its eponymous provincial capital. Nagorno-Karabakh War The Nagorno-Karabakh War refers to the armed conflict that took place from February 1988 to May 1994, in the small ethnic enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan, between the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh backed by Armenia and Azerbaijani Republic. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet Republics, became enveloped in a protracted, undeclared war as the latter attempted to curb a secessionist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave's parliament had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum was held with the vast majority of the Karabakh population voting in favor of independence. The demand to unify with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the Soviet Union's disintegration neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between the two ethnic groups.

He plays and sings with the band Cran, and also played in a 40-year duet with Peter O'Loughlin. He was the original piper with both Riverdance and the Afro Celt Sound System. Browne has also contributed music to the film soundtracks of Circle of Friends, Rob Roy, Robin of Locksley, The Secret of Roan Inish, Streets of Gold, Gangs of New York, and the TV series Bringing It All Back Home. Early years Browne was born in Dublin in 1965 into a musical background. His grandmother, Delia Murphy, wrote, recorded and popularised many Irish songs in the 1930s and 1940s. Musicians such as S√©amus Ennis, Willie Clancy and Denis Murphy were regular visitors to Browne's family home over the years. He began playing the pipes at the age of seven, his main influences being pipers Willie Clancy, Johnny Doran and S√©amus Ennis, and fiddlers Denis Murphy and Tommy Potts. Career Browne has toured extensively in Europe and in the US, as well as playing in Russia, India, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan. He gives master classes throughout the world. He has been involved in many album recordings since his first venture into the studio in 1982 and has collaborated with many of the top artists playing traditional Irish music, classical, pop, jazz and Country. These include people such as An√∫na, D√≥nal Lunny, Finbar Wright, Alan Stivell, The Indigo Girls, Tommy Hayes, Sean Tyrrell, Bill Whelan, Elvis Costello, Nightnoise, Michael Kamen, Paul Brady, Bill Laswell, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Peter Gabriel and Deep Forest. After releasing the easy-listening album Celtic Moods in 1997, Browne released a solo traditional CD The Wynd You Know in 2001, with Claddagh Records. =Duet with Peter O'Loughlin= Browne's friendship and musical collaboration with Peter O'Loughlin spanned the 40 years from their initial meeting in 1977 to Peter's death on 22 October 2017. Their strong combination of mid-19th century flat-pitch pipes and tuned-down fiddle, playing the old dance music of Ireland, makes for a rare and thoroughly enjoyable evening's entertainment. They recorded 3 albums: 'The South West Wind' (1988), 'Touch Me if You Dare' (2002), and 'The Legacy (2016). =Cran= Browne is a member of the group Cran with Se√°n Corcoran and Desi Wilkinson. Cran has released five CDs and tour worldwide. The core of their repertoire is native Irish material ‚Äì dance music or slow airs on flute and pipes, and vocals ranging from the highly ornamented sean-n√≥s songs of Conamara to the rollicking port a' bh√©il or mouth music of Donegal. Their Hiberno-English song repertoire (songs from Ireland in English) covers the entire gamut from the old story-telling \\"long ballads\\" to lively comic songs of \\"pure divilment and rascality\\". They also include material from the related Scots-Gaelic tradition and from the other Atlantic Celts, the Bretons. Cran have released five CDs: [The Crooked Stair (1993, reissued 2005); Black Black Black (1998); Lover‚Äôs Ghost (2000); Music from the Edge of the World (2002); Dally and Stray (2014)]. Since their teens, Browne and fiddle player Kevin Glackin have played as a duet. Kevin, regularly joins Cran for recordings along with Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill (Bothy Band). =Riverdance= Browne was the original piper for the Eurovision interval performance of Riverdance in 1994 and his recording has featured in almost every show since. He chose not to join the teeming cast when the show went on the road, preferring instead to concentrate on his personal projects and to leave the touring to pipers with more time on their hands. =Afro Celt Sound System= In the mid-1990s, Browne was asked if he would like to join a project which was starting up revolving around Peter Gabriel's 2nd \\"World Music Recording Week\\". Musicians converged from all over the planet to ramble from project to project being recorded in up 7 recording setups in Real World Studios. Out of this intense meeting of musicians was born the Afro Celt Sound System which went on to become Real World's most successful venture. It was a meeting of African and Irish musicians in the convivial company of some of the top London programmers. The Afro Celts toured the world and Browne remained with the band for the first two albums, writing and recording in various locations between Ireland and England. Tracks were licensed for countless documentaries, ads and films, the strangest of which was Farrah Fawcett sculpting nude in a Playboy video to the sound of Browne's opening track on the 1st Afro Celt CD. =Performances= Browne has played many prestigious concerts in Ireland and abroad as a solo musician and has also been a guest member to a wide variety of groups. Although best known as a traditional musician, Browne is also keenly interested in exploring other musical genres particularly in film and television. He has written and performed music for fashion shows in London and Paris by designers Lainey Keogh and John Rocha. =Teaching= Browne has been teaching the pipes, flute and whistle worldwide for the last 25 years and has recently developed a much sought-after music appreciation/listening class. In 2005 an Arts Council DEIS grant enabled him to make his class completely portable and has proved a huge addition to his teaching capabilities. =Film Music and Television= Along with Michael Kamen, Browne composed the soundtrack for the documentary film The Dolphin's Gift, directed by Kim Kindersley. More recently, the two of them collaborated on the score to Circle of Friends, the film dramatisation of Maeve Binchy's novel. Browne has also contributed music to the film soundtracks of Robin of Lcksley, Rob Roy, Fierce Creatures, The Secret of Roan Inish, Streets of Gold and Gangs of New York. On Anjelica Huston's Mrs. Browne, Browne was Traditional Irish Music Director. He composed and recorded scores for the audio-visual displays at the National 1798 Visitor Centre in Enniscorthy, at the Waterford Treasures museum and at King John's Castle in Limerick city. TG4, the Irish TV station, commissioned Browne to write the music for the daily news program Nuacht, a six-part drama series Geibheann and the drama An Gaeilgeoir Nocht. Browne appears regularly on Irish music and magazine programmes on national television and radio. He has also played for numerous television advertisements. He appeared on ABC Network's 65 million-audience Good Morning America playing the Uilleann Pipes with D√≥nal Lunny, Nollaig Casey and Arty McGlynn. He played on the theme music to the six-part series Bringing It All Back Home ‚Äì an independent television programme dealing with the influence of Irish music on American folk and contemporary music. Browne featured on Hummingbird's Rivers of Sound, which explored many aspects of traditional Irish music. =Theatre= Browne worked with Tommy Hayes, on the writing and performance of music for the Abbey Theatre productions of The Playboy of the Western World and Macbeth. He joined forces again with Tommy and dancer Cindy Cummings to give off-beat improvised performances. The Olympia Theatre performance of The Tailor and Ansty with Anna Manahan and Frank Kelly saw Browne playing music and acting a small role. Browne's version of the Blasket Island air Port na bPuca√≠ was chosen by Limerick's Daghda dance group for their part in the huge Famine commemoration held in Millstreet in 1997.

People were drawn to the area and canals were dug, both to drain the peat and to transport the cuts. Buckwheat was farmed on the drained peats.

Founded in December 1972 in the Tsuen Wan district of Hong Kong, its current headquarters are located in North Point. Since that time, the company has grown to 98 outlets all over Hong Kong (94 fast food, 2 cafes and 2 specialty restaurants) and 13 locations in Mainland China including major cities such as Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Beijing. Behind Caf√© de Coral, Fairwood is the second largest fast food chain in Hong Kong and serves over 100,000 customers each day. Fairwood operates three main businesses including its core fast food business, an institutional catering business primarily designed for school lunches, and a third business that operates specialty restaurants including Buddy Cafe, Cafe Porto and Cafe Oasis.  History  Fairwood was founded by Dennis Lo Fong- cheung, brother of Vitasoy founder Lo Kwee-seong and Caf√© de Coral founder Victor Lo Tang-seong. It opened its first restaurant in December 1972 in Chung On Street, Tsuen Wan, and its second in Fuk Wing Street, Sham Shui Po, five years later. By September 1991 when Fairwood made its initial public offering, it had expanded to 52 locations and operated its own facility for processing food in an effort to lower costs and maintain consistency. On 31 December 2008, Fairwood announced that Chan Chee Shing would replace Dennis Lo as CEO of Fairwood Holdings, with Mr Lo retaining his position as Chairman. = Rebranding = Old logo, until 2003 Fairwood originally adopted a green color scheme in its first stores and used a happy clown on its logo. Its name literally means \\"big happiness\\". The SARS outbreak in 2003 had a negative impact on the fast food industry in Hong Kong and as a result, Fairwood conducted research and subsequently rebranded itself. It contracted graphics designer Alan Chan to design its new logo, that of a \\"jumping man\\" which is made to resemble the Chinese character for \\"big\\" (Â§ß). Overnight, Fairwood changed all the signs on its stores. On 18 November 2003, Fairwood launched a new flagship store in Causeway Bay. The new store concept, designed by Steve Leung and Yasumichi Morita, featured shades of orange, vinyl material, and an overall vibrant look that was intended to increase the restaurant's appeal. In addition to a visual redesign, Fairwood reformulated and improved its signature dishes and released them under the \\"Ah Wood\\" brand. These dishes included such favorites as curry beef brisket and baked pork chop over rice. Fairwood also banned smoking in all of its restaurants, a first for any fast food chain in Hong Kong at the time. This was before the public smoking ban in indoor areas in Hong Kong in 2007. = Expansion = In March 2007, Fairwood announced its plans to increase its restaurant count to 100 in Hong Kong and to 30 in Mainland China by 2010. This expansion will be accompanied by a marketing campaign featuring celebrities in order to attract a more youthful crowd. In addition, Fairwood will expand its menu in its Mainland outlets to better cater to local tastes.  Fare  Fairwood serves fast food, including a blend of Chinese, Japanese and Western cuisine. The menu changes throughout the day and is split into 4 meal times: Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea and Dinner. In addition, some items may sell out and be replaced by others. The entire menu is evaluated and rotated on a weekly basis. In all, Fairwood cycles around over 200 dishes. Dishes themselves include staples such as Siu Mei, baked pork chop with rice, curry beef brisket and twists on Western dishes such as fried eggs with luncheon meat, spaghetti bolognaise and baked macaroni with ham. Soups such as Russian borscht are also served. On occasion, more seasonal dishes will be served. For example, hot pot and clay pot dishes are served in the winter, when they are typically consumed. :Sample dishes: {valign=top :* Baked pork chop over rice :* Curry beef brisket :* Spaghetti bolognese valign=top :* Baked macaroni with ham :* Char siu over rice :* Soy sauce chicken over rice valign=top :* Roast duck over Rice :* Borscht :* Milk tea }  Service and preparation  As is customary in most HK-style fast food restaurants and fast casual restaurants, customers view the menu on the wall and order at the counter. Customers can pay using cash, AliPay, WeChat Pay or Octopus card. Most dishes are prepared to order, and the customer will pick them up when they are ready. Seating is first-come, first- served.

Before becoming Bishop of Richmond, he served as rector of the North American College, and later, of The Catholic University of America. Early life O'Connell was born in Donoughmore, County Cork to Michael and Bridget O'Connell. His family soon emigrated to the United States and settled in Columbia, South Carolina, where his father's two brothers, Jeremiah and Joseph, were serving as missionary priests. As a young man, O'Connell felt called to be a priest and entered St. Charles College, Ellicott City, Maryland, in 1868. He came to the attention of James Gibbons, who was then Apostolic Vicar for the State of North Carolina. In part due to the influence of his uncles, in 1871 he was sent to Rome to study at the North American College. \\"So brilliant was the young man that at his examination for the degree of Doctor of Divinity the cardinal prefect and examining professors accorded it to him by acclamation instead of by the usual method of balloting.\\"Arline Boucher and John Tehan (1962), Prince of Democracy: James Cardinal Gibbons, 1966 reprint, New York: Doubleday Image, Ch. 5, \\"The Road to Baltimore\\", p. 93. O'Connell was ordained in Rome on May 26, 1877 by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta. Career When Gibbons was appointed Archbishop of Baltimore, he sent Father O'Connell back to Rome in November as his procurator to accept the bishop's pallium. In the two months he was there O'Connell closely observed how the Curia functioned. In 1884 he became secretary to Gibbons, and was sent to Rome with the decrees of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore. In 1885 O'Connell was appointed rector of his alma mater in Rome, a position he held until 1895. As rector of the North American College, O'Connell was the unofficial Roman contact for the American bishops. In 1887, he was chosen a Domestic Prelate, giving him the title of Monsignor.‚ÄúMost Rev. Denis Joseph O'Connell, D. D.‚Äù The Catholic Historical Review, vol. 13, no. 1, 1927, pp. 100‚Äì104. JSTOR Upon his return to Richmond, he was assigned to St. Peter's Church. From 1903 to 1909, he served as the third rector of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C..

He made his way from schoolboy teams to work up through the youth ranks at Swindon Town before making his d√©but in the reserves in April 1960. He signed as a professional for the club in May 1960 but did not play first team football until March 1962. He scored his first goal for Swindon in a match with Queens Park Rangers on 1 September. Smart was relegated to the reserves for much of the 1962‚Äì63 season, before being recalled for the final three games of the season. He scored in each of these games and assured Swindon's promotion to Division 2 for the first time in their history. In 1965 he became the first nominated substitute to be used in a Swindon Town game. Over the next few seasons, Smart became a first-team regular, moving into a role that allowed fellow striker Don Rogers to excel. Smart's best form came in 1968/69, when he scored fifteen goals. Six of these came in the League Cup campaign, including the opening goal in the 1969 League Cup Final, when he benefited from a mistake in the Arsenal defence before bundling the ball into the net. He created Swindon's second and third goals, both scored by Rogers. He was also a part of the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup and Anglo-Italian League Cup winning sides. In the twilight of his Town career, Smart moved back into a wing-half or midfield position. He left Swindon at the end of the 1972/73 season, and joined Charlton Athletic on a free transfer. He returned to the Swindon area a year later, with spells at Bath City and Trowbridge Town before retiring. As of 1999 he was landlord of the Plough Inn in Old Town, Swindon.

Religious Composition by Country 2010 Hinduism is the second largest religion in R√©union (6.7%) and Seychelles (2.4%). History Hinduism took root in Africa from the late 19th century onwards through the spread of the British Empire, which colonized huge swaths of land throughout Asia and Africa, including almost the entirety of the Indian subcontinent. Many Indians were recruited as indentured servants throughout the British Empire, settling mainly in the British colonies of Southern and Eastern Africa. The descendants of these settlers often chose to remain in Africa after the end of colonial rule, developing Indo-African communities that remain to this day. Hinduism is non- proselytizing religion and was usually not propagated to the same lengths or through the same means as Christianity and Islam. As such, it has mostly been confined to practise by the Indo-African communities of these countries. However, in post-colonial Africa, a small-scale movement for Hinduism and its propagation outside the Indo-African community has occurred, spearheaded by such individuals as Swami Ghanananda, the first Hindu swami of Ghana. Today, Lagos, Nigeria, which did not receive an original influx of Indian migrants as did countries such as South Africa and Uganda, is home to over 25,000 Hindus, mostly local converts and more recent, post-independence Indian immigrants. This was primarily the work of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) missionaries. While Hinduism has been cited as possessing many parallels to traditional African religions, it has received opposition from the entrenched Christian elites and Muslim minorities of these countries. The Swaminarayan faith has a sizable following in Africa. Several temples belonging to the faith have been built in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. North Africa West Africa Hinduism is a recent phenomenon in West Africa most notably Ghana where it is said to be the fastest growing religion. However the Hindu presence in other West African states is limited to South Asian people residing in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Although the Dutch managed to capture most of the coastal areas in Sri Lanka they were never able to control the Kandyan Kingdom located in the interior of the island.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/sri-lanka/history- kandy.htm Dutch Ceylon existed from 1640 until 1796. In the early 17th century, Sri Lanka was partly ruled by the Portuguese and Sri Lankan kingdoms, who were constantly battling each other. Although the Portuguese were not winning the war, their rule was rather burdensome to the people of those areas controlled by them. While the Dutch were engaged in a long war of independence from Spanish rule, the Sinhalese king (the king of Kandy) invited the Dutch to help defeat the Portuguese. The Dutch interest in Ceylon was to have a united battle front against the Iberians at that time. History =Background= The Portuguese The Dutch were invited by the Sri Lankans to help fight the Portuguese. They signed the Kandyan Treaty of 1638 with Rajasinghe II and soon embarked on a war against their common enemy. As such the Dutch were appointed as a protector of the country. Meanwhile, however, Rajasinghe II approached the French and offered them the Trincomalee fort as a check against Dutch power. The Dutch captured Trinco from the French and controlled all the maritime provinces of the island. Rajasinghe and the Dutch were both playing a double game trying to outwit each other, and the treaty of 1638 was never implemented. The Dutch ruled all the Tamil provinces and brought Tanjore Tamil slaves to work in the cinnamon gardens in the Western Province and tobacco farms in Jaffna. The capital of Dutch Coromandel was in Pulicat and they brought needed manpower from the Indian colonies. The Dutch and Portuguese Portuguese rule was always in the maritime provinces and the people whom they converted were the coastal folk. They were the backbone of their power. Many of the princes they converted had either died or were no longer Catholic. The rest of Ceylon remained in the Buddhist-Hindu religion. The Dutch were used by the Sinhalese king to take revenge on the Portuguese who wanted to expand their rule. The coming of the Dutch ensured that the Portuguese had two enemies to deal with, so that finally the Portuguese were forced to sign a treaty with the Dutch and come to terms with their open economies. Finally, the Portuguese left Ceylon. Portugal was at war with its ruler, the King of Spain. Once Portugal obtained its freedom from Spain in 1640, the Netherlands settled for peace with Portugal. Then they divided the occupied areas of Ceylon amicably under a treaty signed in Goa. Slowly, the Dutch became the rulers of coastal and outer areas of Ceylon and Indonesia, and the Portuguese were left with smaller pieces of territory than those of the Dutch and the English. Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War From the time that Christopher Columbus landed in America there was a significant Iberian challenge facing large parts of the world for Spain and Portugal in conquering the Americas and many other territories around the world. In the east, Portugal held territories not only in Ceylon but in India, in the Persian Gulf, and what is now Indonesia, then referred to as the East Indies. From 1580 to 1640, the throne of Portugal was held by the Habsburg kings of Spain resulting in the biggest colonial empire until then (see Iberian Union). In 1583 Philip I of Portugal, II of Spain, sent his combined Iberian fleet to clear the French traders from the Azores, decisively hanging his prisoners-of- war from the yardarms and contributing to the \\"Black Legend\\". The Azores were the last part of Portugal to resist Philip's reign over Portugal. The Netherlands meanwhile were in open revolt against their Habsburg overlord and declared themselves a Republic in 1581. Prior to 1580 Dutch merchants had procured colonial produce mostly from Lisbon, but the Iberian Union cut off this supply. Survival of the fledgling republic depended on their going into the colonial business themselves. With two global empires to rule, and with growing colonial competition with the Dutch, English and French, the Habsburg kings neglected the protection of some of the Portuguese possessions around the world. In this period Portugal lost a great number of lands to the new colonial rivals. A map of the lands of the Habsburg kings in the period of personal union of Portugal (blue) and Spain (red/pink) (1580‚Äì1640) During the Twelve Years' Truce (1609‚Äì21) the Dutch made their navy a priority in order to devastate Spanish maritime trade ‚Äî upon which much of Spain's economy depended ‚Äî after the resumption of war. In 1627, the Castilian economy collapsed. Even with a number of victories, Spanish resources were now fully stretched across Europe and also at sea protecting their vital shipping against the greatly improved Dutch fleet. Spain's enemies, such as the Netherlands and England, coveted its overseas wealth, and in many cases found it easier to attack poorly-defended Portuguese outposts than Spanish ones. The Spanish were simply no longer able to cope with naval threats. In the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War that followed many erstwhile Portuguese possession fell into Dutch hands. Between 1638 and 1640 the Netherlands even came to control part of Brazil's northeast region, with their capital in Recife. The Portuguese won a significant victory in the Second Battle of Guararapes in 1649. By 1654, the Netherlands had surrendered and returned control of all Brazilian land to the Portuguese. Although Dutch colonies in Brazil were wiped out, during the course of the 17th century the Dutch were able to occupy Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope, and the East Indies, and to take over the trade with Japan at Nagasaki. Portugal's Asiatic territories were reduced to bases at Portuguese Macau, Portuguese Timor and Portuguese India. =Admiral van Spilbergen= Vimaladharmasurya I receiving Joris van Spilbergen, 1603 In year 1603, on 2 June, the Dutch Admiral Joris van Spilbergen arrived in Ceylon with three ships from the Dutch port of Veere after a 12-month voyage. Visiting Kandy, the seat of King Vimaladharmasuriya I, Spilbergen and the King developed cordial relations. The King's admiration for his new-found friend was so deep that he began to learn the Dutch language saying ‚ÄòKandy is now Flanders‚Äô. They discussed future relations, focussing on possible Dutch military assistance to expel the Portuguese from the coastal areas as well as the trade in cinnamon and pepper. As a token of his friendship, the Dutch Admiral left in the King's service two versatile and skilled musicians: Erasmus Matsberger and Hans Rempel. =Second fleet and the massacre at Batticaloa Beach= Shortly after the successful visit of Van Spilbergen, a second Dutch fleet under command of Sebalt de Weert arrived on the island. De Weert was a very skilful commander who discovered the Falkland Islands during the attempt by Dutch Admirals Cordes and Mahu to find an alternative route to the East Indies through Cape Horn in 1598. After an initial agreement with the King of Kandy, he returned in 1603 to Batticaloa with a fleet of six ships to take part in a joint effort to oust the Portuguese from the island. During his stay he took four passing Portuguese ships but released the Portuguese crews who had surrendered to the Dutch on the promise of quarter. The King was very angered by this action and after a perceived insult to his wife, he ordered his men to kill De Weert and 50 of his unarmed compatriots. =First victory at Batticaloa= The Batticaloa fort, around 1665 The Dutch storm the fort of Galle in 1640. After this unhappy event, the Dutch concentrated on organising their trade with the East Indian spice islands. It took more than three decades before the Dutch again undertook action to expel the Portuguese who had arrived some 150 years earlier and were firmly established on the island. After many bloody wars with the Portuguese, King Rajasingha II became convinced that lasting peace with the Portuguese was not possible and he invited the Dutch to force them off the island. At that time the Dutch were still at war with Portugal, who was in a personal union with Spain. The Dutch Council of the Indies in Batavia (Dutch East India) complied with this request and in 1637 sent four ships to the island under Captain Jan Thijssen Payart who signed a treaty with the King. On 4 January 1638 a decisive sea engagement took place off the coast of Goa between Portuguese and Dutch naval forces. The Portuguese fleet was decimated following this battle and the victorious Dutch Admiral Adam Westerwolt (1580-1639) decided to attack the Portuguese fort at Batticaloa on Ceylon with a fleet of five ships and 800 men. In coalition with strong Singhalese forces he conquered the fort on 18 May 1638. Five days later, following this victorious conquest, Westerwolt in the name of the States General, Prince Frederik Hendrik and the Dutch East India Company agreed a new Treaty with King Rajasingha in his Palace in Batticaloa. The Treaty was a landmark and set the tone for future relations between the Kandyan Kings and the Dutch. Under the Treaty the Dutch were to have a monopoly over all trades except elephants. The forts captured from the Portuguese would be garrisoned by the Dutch or demolished, as the King thought fit. The crucial clause ‚Äòas the King thought fit‚Äô was however only included in the Sinhala and not in the Dutch text of the Treaty. This later gave rise to much disagreement between the two parties. The same goes for the clause stating that the King would pay any expenses incurred by the Dutch in the war effort against the Portuguese. Slowly but surely the Dutch land and naval forces continued to oust the Portuguese from parts of Ceylon. In February 1640 the Portuguese fort of Negombo, a short distance North of Colombo was captured by Philip Lucasz. Following his sudden death, the command was devolved to the capable Willem Jacobsz Coster who earlier fought under Admiral Westerwolt at the east coast. Against overwhelming odds he besieged the strong fort at Galle. After storming the city on 13 March 1640, he became master of it within a few hours. For the next 18 years Galle would remain the centre of Dutch power in Ceylon. =Dutch Ceylon (1664-1795)= The Dutch retained an area as compensation for the cost of war and gradually extended their land.

The British had planned after their conquest of India to take over a dozen Dutch possessions in the region, with Ceylon as the biggest prize. Their chance came when in the winter of 1794/95 Holland was overrun by the French army and Prince William V, the Dutch Stadtholder (nominal Head of State) had fled with his family to England. The States General was replaced by the so-called Batavian Republic under control of the French. This situation was used by the British to cripple the Dutch trade and to gain possession of its colonies. The leadership in Colombo was uncertain what to do. If they vested in the new Batavian Republic they were a potential target of a British attack. If they remained loyal to the exiled Stadtholder the attitude of the British would be more difficult to assess. In the meantime, Governor Falck had died in 1785 after a short illness. He was succeeded by Willem Jacob van der Graaff (1785 ‚Äì 1793) who turned out to be an aggressive expansionist and attempted to extend Dutch control well beyond the established limits. In 1792 Van der Graaff was ready for war with the Kandyan Kingdom. But the VOC Council of the Indies in Batavia realised the dangers of such action and ordered the Governor to abandon his venture. In protest, Van der Graaff resigned and was succeeded by the wavering Jan Gerard van Angelbeek, who would become the last Dutch Governor of Ceylon. Under strong pressure from the British Foreign Minister, Lord Grenville, Prince William V issued in February 1795 orders to Van Angelbeek to put his forces, forts and warships under British ‚Äòprotection‚Äô. He should consider the British troops ‚Äò‚Ä¶ belonging to a power that is in friendship and alliance with their High Mightinesses (the Governors of the VOC), and who come to prevent the Colony from being invaded by the French‚Äô. After the war, the British Government promised to restore the Colony to the Dutch. Van Angelbeek first accepted Prince William's letter and agreed with the British presence on the island. Later however, after aggressive military pressure from the British, Van Angelbeek and his Political Council took the fateful decision that as the Batavian Republic was considered the sovereign of the colonies and their troops should be ordered to resist the British occupation. But the Dutch Governor did not realise that British intrigues had already irreparably undermined his military capabilities. The defence of Dutch Ceylon was undertaken mainly by European mercenaries, in particular, the De Meuron Regiment: 1,000 men strong and for two-thirds consisting of Swiss soldiers. In an extraordinary act on 30 March 1795, the British secret agent Hugh Cleghorn signed a contract with the proprietor of the Regiment, Count Charles-Daniel de Meuron to transfer his regiment into British service for the sum of ¬£6,000. This sealed the fate of the Dutch in Ceylon. After a token resistance, Van Angelbeek gave up. Many Dutch officers and soldiers felt betrayed by their own Governor and at the end of the siege of Colombo turned their heavy guns on the Governor's palace. In vain; on 14 February 1796, the Dutch forces surrendered with minimal bloodshed. Pierre-Frederic de Meuron, brother of Count Charles- Daniel, changed his blue Dutch uniform for a red British one and became Military Governor of Ceylon in September 1797 until he was relieved by Frederic North, the first British Governor. The Maritime Provinces of Ceylon became British never to be returned to the Dutch. In January 1816 the last Kandian King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe, the youngest Nayakka prince to have ascended the throne of the Sinhalese Kingdom was banished from Ceylon. He was relocated in the little Indian coastal town of Vellore as a state prisoner of the British, together with his family and relatives. He died in 1832 at the age of 52. His son, the rightful heir to the throne, never left the shores of India and died as an unknown in 1842. Administration Legacy =Dutch diaspora= Many of the Dutch Burghers migrated to Australia after British rule ended in 1948 to take advantage of the White Australia policy due to their European descent. =Placenames= The islands of Palk Straits were renamed during Dutch rule in Dutch as Leiden, Kayts and other cities of the Netherlands. The Dutch priest Philippus Baldeus has written a great historical record similar to Mahavamsa on the Jaffna people and their culture and it was immediately published in Dutch and German with several beautiful pictures. At the Point Pedro Market Square a granite stone inscription still marks the place where Rev. Baldeus preached to the Tamils under a big tamarind tree. This tamarind tree was uprooted during the cyclone of 1964. =Language= When the Dutch arrived in Ceylon, Portuguese was a recognized language in the occupied areas of the island. It was, however, a Portuguese creole due to its relationship with the native languages. Although this language is no longer spoken there are Dutch influences found in the Sinhala and Tamil languages. There is also a portion of the Sri Lankan population with Dutch surnames, often people of mixed Dutch and Sri Lankan heritage, who are known as Burghers. = Dutch language policy = During the 140 years of Dutch control, they pursued an active policy of trying to make Dutch the principal language on the island. This included setting up schools to teach Dutch to local people, although these often suffered from a lack of qualified teachers. However, the Dutch language policy by and large failed. One reason for this was that Portuguese had already become a language of wider communication (LWC) in Ceylon prior to 1656.(Dutch) Nicoline van der Sijs, Nederlandse woorden wereldwijd. The Hague: SDU, 2010, pp. 116-117, 125. = Dutch loanwords in Sinhala and Tamil = When the Dutch language was introduced it also mingled with indigenous and Portuguese influences. Nevertheless, there are many Dutch loanwords in the two official languages of Ceylon, Sinhala and Tamil. Nicoline van der Sijs reckons that there are some 230 Dutch loanwords in Sinhala. Many of these are in the fields of warfare, trade and agriculture. For example, the Sinhala word for 'potato' , pronounced ,' hospital ' (‡∂â‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑è‡∂Ω‡∑ô), ‡∂â‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂ª‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑î‡∑Ä and ‡∂â‡∑É‡∑ä‡∂≠‡∑ù‡∂¥‡∑ä‡∂¥‡∑î‡∑Ä comes from the Dutch . In Tamil, also spoken in Southern India, there are reckoned to be about 50 Dutch loanwords.

PD-1-6266). The album largely consists of Frippertronics, with much of the work being performed by improvisation. On the Under Heavy Manners side of the album, the effect was modified in what Fripp described as \\"Discotronics\\", adding a solid drum beat and bass line to create a dancier sound. The design concept was by Fripp and Chris Stein, with Stein credited for the cover photography. The original planned title for the album was Music for Sports, but Fripp eventually decided to choose a title that would not be associated with colleague Brian Eno's Music for... album series. This record has never been released on CD. However, the track \\"Under Heavy Manners\\" and a longer and retitled version of \\"The Zero of the Signified\\" (called \\"God Save the King\\") with an added guitar solo are on the abridged Robert Fripp and The League of Gentlemen God Save the King CD release.

All of the tracks are instrumental, bar \\"Under Heavy Manners\\", which features words half recited, half sung by David Byrne (credited using the pseudonym \\"Absalm el Habib\\"). The track \\"God Save the Queen\\" bears little resemblance to the British national anthem, although it is based on the opening notes of that tune. It was inspired by a comment from an audience member, who suggested that, as the performance was taking place on the tenth anniversary of the Woodstock Festival in August 1979, Fripp should reprise Jimi Hendrix's performance of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\".

With 4,132 described species in 340 genera worldwide, it is the most speciose group among pyraloids.  Description  Imagines ‚Äì the adult life stage ‚Äì vary considerably in size: the forewing span ranges from 11.5 mm e.g. in Metasia to 50 mm in the robust-bodied Eporidia. In resting position, the moths exhibit a characteristic triangular shape, with the wings usually folded over the abdomen, the forewings covering the hindwings. Some Spilomelinae diverge from this common resting pattern, like Maruca with widely spread wings, and Atomopteryx and Lineodes with a resting position much resembling that of Pterophoridae. All Spilomelinae moths have well developed compound eyes, antennae and mouthparts, although in the genera Niphopyralis and Siga the proboscis is lost. Synapomorphic characters of the subfamily comprise minute or obsolete maxillary palpi, ventrally projecting fornix tympani, and the female genitalia's ductus bursae with a weak sclerotization or a granulose texture. The moths are furthermore characterized by an often bilobed praecinctorium, pointed spinula, and the absence of chaetosemata and of a retinacular hook. A gnathos or pseudognathos can be present or absent and is therefore of little diagnostic value, except for several genera of Agroterini, where the gnathos has a well-developed medial process.  Food plants  Food plant use is diverse within Spilomelinae, ranging from ferns over gymnosperms to a wide spectrum of angiosperms. The larvae of Niphopyralis live in nests of weaver ants, where they feed on ant larvae. Many Spilomelinae tribes have a narrow food spectrum, with the larvae feeding on plants of only one or a few plant families, e.g. Lineodini on Solanaceae, Hydririni primarily on Sapindaceae and Convolvulaceae, and Trichaeini on Rubiaceae.  Economic impact  A number of Spilomelinae are considered \\"pest species\\", with their larvae feeding on a variety of economically important crops. Notable representatives are the genera of Leucinodes and Neoleucinodes with larvae feeding on Solanaceae, Cnaphalocrocis and Marasmia damaging Poaceae like Oryza, Sorghum and Zea, the legume pod borers of the genus Maruca on Fabaceae and Amaranthaceae, and Spoladea, who feeds on a variety of different agriculturally important plant families. The box tree moth, Cydalima perspectalis, whose larvae feed on box trees, a prominent ornamental plant in many parks and gardens, has been accidentally introduced to Europe in the mid-2000s and to North America in 2019.  Systematics  Until the late 1990s, Spilomelinae were included in the subfamily Pyraustinae as tribe Spilomelini. In the past, Spilomelinae were believed to be polyphyletic. However, a recent phylogenetic study by Mally et al. (2019), based on molecular genetic and morphological data, found the subfamily to be monophyletic. The study's authors furthermore proposed 13 tribes within Spilomelinae: *Agroterini Acloque, 1897 *Asciodini Mally, Hayden, Neinhuis, Jordal & Nuss, 2019 *Herpetogrammatini Mally, Hayden, Neinhuis, Jordal & Nuss, 2019 *Hydririni Minet, 1982 *Hymeniini Swinhoe, 1900 *Lineodini Amsel, 1956 *Margaroniini Swinhoe & Cotes, 1889 *Nomophilini Kuznetzov & Stekolnikov, 1979 *Spilomelini Guen√©e, 1854 *Steniini Guen√©e, 1854 *Trichaeini Mally, Hayden, Neinhuis, Jordal & Nuss, 2019 *Udeini Mally, Hayden, Neinhuis, Jordal & Nuss, 2019 *Wurthiini Roepke, 1916 = \\"Non- euspilomeline\\" tribes = Hydririni, Lineodini, Udeini and Wurthiini share several plesiomorphic characters with the sister group of Spilomelinae, the Pyraustinae. These plesiomorphies are: absence of longitudinal strips on the male abdominal segment 8; male genitalia with a straight to concave valva costa and a phallus with an evenly sclerotized apodeme; female genitalia with a lanceolate ‚Äúediacaroid‚Äù signum in the corpus bursae and in several taxa with an appendix bursae attached to the corpus bursae. Due to these plesiomorphies, these four Spilomelinae tribes are referred to as \\"non-euspilomeline\\" tribes as opposed to the monophyletic \\"euspilomeline\\" group that represents a more derived group of Spilomelinae. The \\"non-euspilomeline\\" tribes form a paraphylum as they do not comprise the \\"euspilomelines\\". = \\"Euspilomeline\\" tribes = Syllepis hortalis (Hydririni), adult Leucinodes cordalis (Lineodini), adult female Udea rubigalis (Udeini), adult Niphopyralis chionesis (Wurthiini), adult Pantographa limata (Agroterini), adult, from the US state of Missouri Unidentified species of Parotis (Margaroniini), adult Glyphodes stolalis (Margaroniini), adult Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Spilomelini), adult Herpetogramma aeglealis (Herpetogrammatini), larva, last instar Hymenia perspectalis (Hymeniini), adult Psara obscuralis (Asciodini), adult Prophantis smaragdina (Trichaeini), adult Duponchelia fovealis (Steniini), adult Mecyna flavalis (Nomophilini), adult The tribes Agroterini, Margaroniini, Spilomelini, Herpetogrammatini, Hymeniini, Asciodini, Trichaeini, Steniini and Nomophilini form the monophylum of \\"euspilomelines\\" (Greek eu- for \\"good\\" or \\"true\\"), all sharing a common ancestor. The synapomorphies of euspilomelines are: male abdominal tergite 8 with an emarginate anterior edge; male genitalia with partly sclerotized hair pencils on the anterior edge of vinculum-tegumen connection, with a convex valva costa, and the phallus without a coecum and the sclerotization of the phallus apodeme reduced to a ventral, longitudinally sclerotized strip along the manica; female genitalia with a longitudinal membranous strip in the antrum, and the lack of a strongly sclerotised colliculum between antrum and ductus seminalis. = Genera currently unplaced in any Spilomelinae tribe = Based on the morphological synapomorphies and characteristics of these tribes, Mally et al. (2019) assigned numerous Spilomelinae genera to these proposed tribes, so that about two thirds of the 339 Spilomelinae genera are placed in these tribes, leaving 132 genera currently unplaced: *Aboetheta Turner, 1914 *Acicys Turner, 1911 *Aediodina Strand, 1919 *Agrammia Guen√©e, 1854 *Almonia Walker, 1866 *Ametrea Munroe, 1964 *Archernis Meyrick, 1886 (= Chrysommatodes Warren, 1896, Metoportha Meyrick, 1894, Protonoceras Warren, 1890) *Arxama Walker, 1866 *Atelocentra Meyrick, 1884 *Auchmophoba Turner, 1913 *Bacotoma Moore, 1885 *Camptomastix Warren, 1892 *Cangetta Moore, 1886 *Carthade Snellen, 1899 *Ceratarcha Swinhoe, 1894 *Chabula Moore, 1886 *Chromodes Guen√©e, 1854 *Cissachroa Turner, 1937 *Coelorhyncidia Hampson, 1896 *Coptobasis Lederer, 1863 *Coremata Amsel, 1956 *Cotachena Moore, 1885 *Criophthona Meyrick, 1884 *Bacotoma Moore, 1885 (= Epactoctena Meyrick, 1937, Platamonia Lederer, 1863, Platamonina J.

Playing career  Arcoleo, born in Mondello, a Palermo maritime frazione, to a fishermans' family, started his professional career in 1966/1967 for his home city team. He returned to play for Palermo in 1970, becoming one of the most representative players for the rosanero in the period. He also played a Coppa Italia final in 1974, being the author of the foul to Giacomo Bulgarelli which allowed Bologna to kick and score the equaliser penalty in injury time, and then win the tournament on penalty shootouts. From 1974/1975 to 1977/1978, Arcoleo played for Genoa, being remembered as the author of the first football goal ever shown on colour TV, during a Serie A home match against Torino ended in a 1‚Äì1 tie and played on 6 February 1977. Arcoleo returned to Palermo, then in Serie B, on 1978, and again played another unsuccessful Coppa Italia final, lost to top division giants Juventus. He left Palermo in 1980 and retired in 1983.  Managing career  In 1983/1984, Arcoleo started his managing career, becoming head coach of Serie D team Mazara. He coached Mazara for two seasons, winning the Serie D league in 1985: however the promotion was then cancelled by the federation because of alleged matchfixing. In 1985/1986, Arcoleo unsuccessfully coached Akragas, as the then-Serie C2 team relegated at the end of the season despite very strong performances in the second half of the season. Arcoleo had his breakthrough at the coaching level during his years at the helm of Trapani, another Serie D team, which he led from the top amateur league to Serie C1 and almost reaching an otherwise historical promotion to Serie B, being defeated on playoffs by Gualdo. Thanks to his results on Trapani, Arcoleo was called to coach \\"his\\" Palermo the next season. The 1995/1996 Palermo, widely considered a minor Serie B team, was mostly composed by local players, most of them right from Arcoleo's Trapani: despite this, the rosanero managed to play one of their best seasons in the 1990s, obtaining a seventh place in the final league table and gaining several successes in the Coppa Italia, eliminating Serie A well-established teams such as Parma and Vicenza. The following 1996/1997 season, however, was the beginning of Arcoleo career breakdowns, as he was fired and Palermo then relegated to Serie C1. Arcoleo was recalled to coach Palermo in the latest matches of the 1997/1998 Serie C campaign, with the rosanero involved in a heavy struggle to avoid relegation, ended to a shocking loss to Battipagliese on playoffs which meant to be the second consecutive relegation for both Arcoleo and Palermo. Since then, Arcoleo coached a number of Serie C teams (Gualdo, Foggia, Frosinone, Nocerina) never being able to end the season in his position. In 2006, he also made a comeback at Trapani, now in Serie D, as \\"technical director\\" and aide for the head coach, but did not achieve any success and instead saw his team relegated to Eccellenza. He is currently a football pundit for a number of regional TV channels of Sicily.

However, the Nintendo DS and GBA versions were conspicuously absent from the announcement.The reported release date for those handhelds is March 19, 2007. It differs vastly from its 2006 release of MLB 2K6. A demo was released on Xbox Live Marketplace for Xbox 360 owners on February 26, 2007, allowing them to play Game 7 of the 2006 National League Championship Series starting in the 7th inning. The game and the demo of the game for the 360 and all other game formats were only available in North America and Japan with no plans to release the game in the Europe for PAL systems. Gameplay The new iteration features a stunningly lifelike batter/pitcher interface on seventh generation console systems, as well as more detailed models and AI tweaks. Last year's \\"Inside Edge\\" also returns, with a tweak in that playing to a player's strengths causes a boost in ability. Other new features, as published by 2K Sports, include: *Signature Style: In a GameSpot interview, it was revealed the game would feature 150 major league players' tendencies and animations that mimic the real-life stars.

It has an elevation of 1,729 metres. This mountain is the highest in the Ch≈´goku region, and the most important volcano on the Daisen volcanic belt: a part of Southwest Honshu volcanic arc, where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting under the Amurian Plate. Outline Mount Daisen is a complex volcano, made by repeated volcanic activity over thousands of years. Eruptions in this area started 1.8 million years ago and resulted in Old Daisen some 500,000 years ago. The Mount Daisen of today, New Daisen, resulted from a second group of eruptions which started 50,000 years ago and ended 10,000 years ago in the caldera of Old Daisen. 50,000 years ago, this mountain had a plinian eruption from which volcanic ash can be found as far away as the Tohoku Region of Japan. Daisen is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan, and also one of the Ch≈´goku 100 mountains. Relief Map History and religion Mount Daisen, which stands directly on the Sea of Japan, was regarded as one of the most important mountains for Japanese Shugend≈ç religion. According to the Izumo Kokudo Fudoki, completed in 733, it was called ≈åkami-take, literally, Mountain of the great god. Mount Daisen has been called H≈çki Fuji and Izumo Fuji, depending on which side of the mountain the viewer is standing on. These names are based on the old H≈çki and Izumo provinces.Paul Hunt, Hiking in Japan: An Adventurer's Guide to the Mountain Trails, pg 73 Halfway up the mountain stands a Buddhist temple, Daisen-ji. This has existed as a centre of worship since the Heian period. It was founded by the Tendai sect in 718. Climbing the mountain used to be severely prohibited without a selected monk of Daisen-ji, and common people could not access the mountain until the Edo period. The mountain has also been important to the mountain ascetics of the Shugend≈ç sect. Just above the temple is the ≈ågamiyama Jinja, literally, shrine of the mountain of the great god. Route After the 2000 Tottori earthquake, some of Mount Daisen's peaks are on the verge of collapse. It is prohibited to ascend the mountain's highest peak, the Kengamine (). Climbers are able to access the Misen Peak (). The most popular route is from Daisen-ji to the Misen Peak. It takes three hours to reach the summit.

In the 1990 Census, Slovak Americans made up the third-largest portion of Slavic ethnic groups. There are currently about 790,000 people of Slovak descent living in the United States.June Granatir Alexander, \\"Slovak Americans.\\" in Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America, edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 4, Gale, 2014), pp. 209-221. online History =Eighteenth century= Isaacus Ferdinand Sharoshi was the first known immigrant from the territory of present-day Slovakia, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary. Sharoshi arrived in the religious colony of Germantown, Pennsylvania, founded by Mennonite preacher Francis Daniel Pastorius, to serve as a teacher and a preacher. Sharoshi apparently returned to Europe after two years. In 1754, Andreas Jelik, an ethnic German from the village of Baja, left the Kingdom of Hungary to train as a tailor. After some travel in Europe, he eventually reached South American shores, via the West Indies, on a Dutch trading ship. After being proclaimed emperor in Madagascar, and bearing letters of recommendation from Benjamin Franklin and funds from a descendant of Ferdinand Magellan, Maurice Benyovszky whose origin is regarded as a mix of Slovak, Hungarian and Polish came to America and fought with American troops in the War for Independence. He joined a cavalry corps led by General Pulaski and fought in the siege of Savannah. He died in Madagascar in 1786, but his wife, Zuzana Honsch, stayed in the United States from 1784 until her death in 1815. Another Slovak fought in the American Revolution; Major Jan Polerecky, who trained at the French Royal Military Academy of St. Cyr, came to America from France to fight with George Washington's army in the War for Independence. He was in the company of the 300 \\"Blue Hussars\\" to whom the British formally surrendered their weapons after the defeat of Cornwallis at Yorktown. When the war was over, Polerecky settled in Dresden, Maine, where he served in a number of public positions. =Nineteenth century= During the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln approved a request to organize a military company named the \\"Lincoln Riflemen of Slavonic Origin.\\" This first volunteer unit from Chicago, which included many Slovaks, fought in the Civil War and was eventually incorporated into the 24th regiment of the Illinois infantry. Slovak immigrant, Samuel Figuli, fought in the Civil War, owned a plantation in Virginia, and later joined an exploratory expedition to the North Pole. Large scale Slovak immigration to the United States began in the 1870s with the forced magyarization policies of the Hungarian government. Because U.S. immigration officials did not keep separate records for each ethnic group within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it is impossible to determine the exact number of Slovak immigrants who entered the United States. Between 1880 and the mid-1920s, approximately 500,000 Slovaks immigrated to the United States. More than half of Slovak immigrants settled in Pennsylvania. Other popular destinations included Ohio, Illinois, New York and New Jersey. Also, Slovak, Arkansas was founded in 1894 by the Slovak Colonization Company. =Twentieth century= Distribution of Slovak Americans according to the 2000 census, Organization, political activism and the creation of Czechoslovakia Denied a voice in politics and the use of their native Slovak language in public places by the ruling Magyars in Hungary, Slovaks in America became socially and politically active, establishing self-help societies and fraternal organizations (such as Sokol, the Slovak League of America and First Catholic Slovak Union), founding newspapers (such as Slovensky dennik and the Jednota), and lobbying the government of the United States‚Äîespecially the Administration of President Woodrow Wilson‚Äîto press for greater freedom for Slovaks suffering under Magyar oppression. In 1910, Slovak and other ethnic leaders in the United States successfully petitioned federal authorities to classify a person by their language rather than country of origin. On the president's orders, new forms replaced the old ones, and Slovaks were no longer classified as \\"Austrians\\" or \\"Hungarians\\" in the 1910 U.S. Census. Slovaks in America were outraged and spurred to greater action by the ƒåernov√° massacre. On October 27, 1907, parishioners in the Slovak village of ƒåernov√° wanted Andrej Hlinka to attend the consecration of the village church he had helped to build, but the ecclesiastical authorities would not permit it. On the day of the consecration, the people tried to stop the Magyar clergy who came to ƒåernov√° and the security forces fired into the crowd, killing nine people on the spot with a total of 15 dead by the end of the day. More than 60 people were wounded. The event encouraged a British journalist and academic, Robert W. Seton-Watson, to denounce Budapest's policies towards the nationalities in his book \\"Racial Problems in Hungary,\\" which he published under the pseudonym Scotus Viator in 1908. In 1915, the leaders of the Czech National Alliance and the Slovak League of America signed the Cleveland Agreement, in which they pledged to cooperate for the common goal of independent statehood for the Czechs and Slovaks. The agreement's five articles laid out the basics of a future joint state for the two nationalities. Three years later, the Pittsburgh Agreement was concluded by representatives of Czechs and Slovaks at a meeting of the American branch of the Czechoslovak National Council in Pittsburgh. The agreement endorsed a program for the struggle for a common state of Czecho-Slovakia and agreed that the new state would be a democratic republic in which Slovakia would have its own administration, legislature, and courts. On October 18, 1918, the primary author of the agreement, T. G. Masaryk, whose father was Slovak and mother Moravian, declared the independence of Czechoslovakia on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was elected the first President of an independent Czechoslovakia in 1920. In 1970, the Slovak World Congress was founded in New York. It became the leading organization of Slovaks living abroad, and represented associations, institutions, and individuals. Communist control of Czechoslovakia Communists took control of Czechoslovakia's government in 1948, leading to a mass migration of Slovak intelligentsia and post-war political figures. Another wave of Slovak immigration was fueled by the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet response to the cultural and political liberalization of the Prague Spring. Many members of this wave belonged to the intelligentsia. Demography Most Slovaks emigrated to cities, especially to those where industries were expanding and felt the need to acquire cheap and unskilled labor. For this reason, the majority of Slovaks settled in the Eastern United States (with special attention to Pennsylvania) where more than half of them settled in milltowns and coal mining districts in the state's western region. Today, almost half of all Slovak Americans reside in Pennsylvania (233,160) and Ohio (137,343). Other important areas where Slovaks settled include New Jersey, New York, and Illinois. Most Slovaks settled in places where there are already Slovaks residing. In fact, between 1908 and 1910, the percentage of Slovaks who settled in places already inhabited by family and friends was 98.4 percent.

They also recorded as The West Virginia Snake Hunters and The McClung Brothers. John Edward McClung (who was the guitar player and singer) was born on August 1, 1906 in Mount Hope, West Virginia and died on February 15, 1991. Emery Samuel McClung (who was the fiddle player) was born on January 3, 1910 in Beckley, West Virginia and he died on March 9, 1970. Biography John and Emery were sons of Caroline Elizabeth Cheetham and Park Walker McClung who were from Raleigh County, West Virginia. Their father Walker was a jeweler but he was also a music teacher and a choir leader of the church they attended in Sprague, West Virginia. Many of Walker's fourteen children learned to play instruments or sing from him. The failing health of their father led John and Emery to start making music on Beckley street corners to help raise grocery money. In the early 1920s, they formed a string band called The West Virginia Trail Blazers, which included George Ward and John Lanchester, both from Beckley, West Virginia. They took their shows all around the mountains in a big Studebaker,Wolfe, Charles (1998). \\"My Rough And Rowdy Ways Volume 1 & Volume 2\\" [Yazoo 2039]. Liner Notes. even going to California on one occasion. This band was kept together until about 1934. In 1927, John and Emery recorded eight songs for Brunswick Records. John played the fiddle and Emery played guitar. The whistling on the songs \\"Standin' In The Need Of Prayer,\\" \\"Birdie,\\" and \\"The Fun Is All Over\\" were provided by future Country Music Hall of Fame member Carson Robison. They also called themselves The West Virginia Snake Hunters during this time, and started working with carnival musician Cleve Chaffin, who was from Wayne County, West Virginia. Chaffin and the McClung Brothers recorded six songs for Paramount Records in 1929. Chaffin had also recorded with another old-time music band, Fruit Jar Guzzlers. After the session for Paramount, Chaffin and the McClung Brothers never recorded again. Later on, the McClung Brothers had a gospel quartet on the radio station WJLS in Beckley. John won an old-time fiddlers' contest in Beckley in August 1950, and Emery won second place. John lived his retired life in Alexandria, Virginia. One of the most popular McClung Brothers' songs was \\"The West Virginia Hills,\\" which was a parody of the West Virginia state anthem about West Virginia moonshine. The McClungs never recorded it but their friend Roy Harvey (also from West Virginia) recorded it as a duet with Earl Shirkey on Columbia Records in 1929. Harvey's version can be found on two CD's \\"Roy Harvey: Complete Recorded Works In Chronological Order Volume 3\\" (Document #8052) and \\"Roy Harvey: Early String Band Favorites\\" (Old Homestead #4017), both released in 1999.

It is also known as seiche pharaon. Sepia pharaonis is likely a complex of at least three species, Sepia pharaonis I, commonly located in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, S. pharaonis II, located from Japan to the Gulf of Thailand and northern Australia; and S. pharaonis III, located from the Indian Ocean to the Andaman Sea. The type specimen was collected in the Gulf of Suez and is deposited at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin.Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda.Sepia pharaonis photographed off Egypt Range and habitat The pharaoh cuttlefish is native to at least the western Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Of all the cuttlefish species in the Persian Gulf, it is the most commonly caught. When hunting at night, it swims up to shallower parts of the sea to feast on a variety of smaller fish, crabs, and occasionally other cuttlefish. It is thought to have reached the Mediterranean Sea as a Lessepsian migrant via the Suez Canal after many of its cuttlebones were washed up on beaches in Israel in the early 2000s. They have been observed to exhibit migratory behavior off of the south-west coast of India. They are more commonly found furthest north during August, and further south in May. They show an even distribution in October and February. Additionally, there are more juveniles present in May, and more adults present in August. The Pharaoh cuttlefish prefer a medium to high amount of sunlight for den location during the day. Additionally, they prefer mud substrata during the day, and either sand or mud substrata during the night.  Hunting  Most cephalopods use their two elongated tentacles for prey hunting, and particularly cuttlefish are known to use a three step process of attention, positioning, and seizure. Adult pharaoh cuttlefish and most juveniles begin their attention stance with throwing their arms and tentacles into a triangle shape turning to the prey, followed by a positioning stage where the tentacles are moved slowly from the center of the triangle as they move towards their prey. They finish this with their seizure phase where they move forward until lunging their tentacles rapidly to grasp their prey before retracting the prey back towards them. Due to their small squat body size and lack of speedy propulsion, Sepia pharaonis have adapted to use this ambush style of tentacle lunging.  Reproduction  Pharaoh cuttlefish reproduce similarly to most other cuttlefish. Large males compete in combat until a victor is decided, although it is often decided without any initiation of physical combat. The males circle each other performing threatening displays of color and tentacles until one male swims off in defeat. The victorious male then mates with females by grabbing them with their tentacles, turning the female so that the two animals are face-to-face, then using a specialized tentacle to insert sperm sacs into an opening near the female's mouth. The male then guards the female until she lays the fertilized eggs a few hours later. Females undergo a series of phases when laying their eggs, beginning with a temporary posture where their arms are held in a fist-like position. They follow this with extending their arms forward and venting onto the spawning ground and eggs via their funnels, before extending their arms to deposit the laid eggs onto the proper substrata.  Coloring and Mimicry  Pharaoh cuttlefish often show a solid color when resting on a solid color background, alternating from a pale white to all dark brown. Additionally, they can show a mottled white and brown color, with a center circle of brown. The mechanism for color in the Pharaoh cuttlefish is about the same as it is in other cuttlefish. This color-changing function is produced by groups of red, yellow, brown, and black pigmented chromatophores above a layer of reflective blue and green tinted iridophores and leucophores, with up to 200 of these specialized pigment cells per square millimeter. These sacs of color are controlled by rings of muscle around the sac. The cuttlefish expands and contracts these muscle rings in order to show different colors. Similarly to other cuttlefish, pharaoh cuttlefish use these chromatophores for camouflage and other cryptic behaviors. They have many types of body patterns, including uniform, mottled, or disruptive. While they have no preference in using any of them, the use of each pattern depends on the surrounding environment as well as predators and prey within the area, and they may even produce a mixed type of body pattern depending on the substrate around them. Depending on the richness of the environment around them, juvenile cuttlefish have exhibited a clear response to color changing and cryptic behavior early on when in sandy loose ocean floors with surrounding objects. Physical enrichment allows the cuttlefish to better explore and learn its surroundings in order to correctly display the coloring and camouflage needed for survival. In addition to color mimicry, cuttlefish and other cephalopods have shown instances of imitating other species, whether for scaring off predators or luring in prey. The pharaoh cuttlefish in particular has been witnessed exhibiting an arm flapping behavior where their first pair of arms are raised and wrinkled at the distal end (away from the body), with the second and third arm pairs bent and flapped at the distal ends as well. While mostly observed during hunting and believed to be a sort of lure by mimicry of hermit crabs to get closer to prey, as hermit crabs are bottom feeders, the cause of the unique flapping display will need to be further verified. Human uses It is a commonly fished species of cuttlefish in the Philippines, as well as the most economically important cuttlefish in the northern Indian Ocean. It is often eaten by humans in these areas. Typically, cuttlefish is consumed as dried, shredded cuttlefish, a popular snack food. And, in the Qing Dynasty manual of Chinese gastronomy, the Suiyuan shidan, the roe of the cuttlefish is considered a difficult to prepare but sought-after delicacy. This species is also being harvested by fishermen as a commercial species in the Suez Canal, Egypt. English abstract Additionally in the past cuttlefish ink was an important dye, called sepia. Today, artificial dyes have mostly replaced natural sepia. The ink of the cuttlefish has also been tested for antibacterial properties, and has been found to display the minimum inhibitory concentrations needed to act as an antibiotic to strains such as E. coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis.

She is known as hertigsdotter, Duke's daughter. She is mentioned as daughter of the \\"Duke Canute\\", and historians differ who that exactly was. For hypotheses, see below. The somewhere in genealogies floating idea that Cecilia's mother were a daughter of king Canute I of Sweden lacks all historical support and must therefore be discarded as unattested romantics. Cecilia married Geatish lord Filip, who became ancestor of the famed Aspen√§s noble house whose Arms depicted lejon√∂rn (= Griffin). Historians differ also over whose child Filip was, what was his correct patronymic and what was his seat manor. After Filip's death, Cecilia lived plenty of years as rich widow; a benefactor of monasteries and so forth. Ultimately she was buried beside her husband Filip. Historians also differ over whether Filip had more than one wife. If he had an earlier wife, then it is not certain that Cecilia was the ancestress of the Aspen√§s (lejon√∂rn) nobles. But if she was the only wife, then it is only natural to presume that she is their ancestress (and future generations of the Lejon√∂rn certainly used first names Knut and Cecilia), which makes her an important figure for future generations of that prominent family. It is presumed that her husband belonged to those who opposed centralized power in Sweden. He seems to have been party in revolts against king Eric XI of Sweden and against the regent Birger jarl sometime in the 1240s and 1250s. Cecilia had attestedly son Birger Filipsson, Lord of Id√∂, executed by beheading as rebel on 20 August 1280, and daughter Ingegerd Filipsdotter. Concluded from, among other reasons, the occurrence of the names Knut and Cecilia among Jon's close descendants, her eldest son was Jon Filipsson who was executed as rebel in 1280. Similarly, she presumably had at least two surviving daughters, of whom it is not known if one of them were with the name attested daughter of hers, Ingegerd: one of those daughters married lord Filip T√∂rnesson, justiciar of N√§rke, and became great-great- grandmother of children of baron Jon Havtoreson, the Norwegian royal hopefuls; and the other married the rebel lord Karl Tjelveson of F√•n√∂, and became foremother of for example the noble families of Eka and of Fr√∂ssvik (whose daughters produced regents and kings of Sweden). Cecilia's father, Duke Canute Who was that \\"Duke Knut\\", Cecilia's historically mentioned father? Three sufficiently possible and credible alternatives have been proposed: * jarl Knut Birgersson of the Bjelbo family, Riksjarl of Sweden who was killed in 1208 in battle of Lena * Canute, Duke of Reval, holder of Blekinge in southern borders of Sweden - bastard son of king Valdemar II of Denmark and Helena, daughter of Swedish riksjarl Guttorm (\\"√ñrnfot\\") * jarl Knut Haakonson, claimant of the throne of Norway in late 1220s (leader of Ribbunger party in Norway); son of jarl Haakon Galin (whose father was Folkvid, justiciar of Vermelandia, and mother was Cecilia Sigurdsdottir of Norway, daughter of king Sigurd II) and Kristin Nikolasdottir, daughter of Nikolas Blaka and Karin Eriksdotter of Sweden, daughter of king St. Eric of Sweden. Knut Birgersson Jarl has been deemed somewhat uneasy choice because of chronological problems. That Knut died 1208, and because of her children's age and her own likely death date, Cecilia firstly need to have been born in the very end of Knut's life (c 1208) when Knut was already elderly (and several decades after birth of that Knut's other attested child/children); and even that makes Cecilia somewhat old for her own marriage and to give birth to her attested children, at last one of whom was executed in 1280 and Cecilia possibly was then living. Additionally, name Cecilia appears not in Knut's immediate family nor his direct ancestry. Duke Canute is uneasy choice because his descendants married with presumed descendants of Cecilia in generations that were Cecilia his daughter and ancestress of that issue, there would have been a marriage of a lady and her first cousin's son, something not almost ever dispensated in those centuries by church. Additionally, name Cecilia appears not in that Knut's family nor his ancestry. Finally, claimant Knut Haakonson of Ribbunger, earl of Norway, is uneasy choice (though possibly easiest of these) because he was not generally called duke. He probably would be called king, or earl, or lord, or master, but not easily duke which title was adopted to Norway in Knut's and Cecilia's lifetime as higher than earl (actually, to Knut's father- in-law duke Skule). However, his recognized title jarl is translated as Dux at least in Sweden. The name Cecilia certainly is present in that Knut's ancestry.

Originally a village (first written mention of which dates from 1159), later municipality (since 1849), it remained a predominantly agricultural settlement until the 1960s. Stod≈Ølky became part of Prague in 1974 and the large housing estate of Jihoz√°padn√≠ Mƒõsto gradually arose on fields in vicinity of the old village in the late 1970s through mid-1990s.

Z√°padn√≠ Mƒõsto, a western extension of the built-up area is currently (as of 2011) under construction. The name derives from the Czech noun stodola for barn; Stod≈Ølky is then a pluralized diminutive of that word (i.e. meaning \\"small barns\\"). Stod≈Ølky is located at the southwestern outskirts of the city, about from the centre.

Our Lady of Meritxell is the patron saint of Andorra. The original statue dated from the late 12th century. However, the chapel in which it was housed burned down on September 8 1972, and the statue was destroyed. A replica can be found in the new Meritxell Basilica, designed in 1976 by Ricardo Bofill. The Catalan philologist Joan Coromines says that \\"Meritxell\\" is a diminutive of merig, from the Latin meridiem (midday in English). Merig is a name used by shepherds to denote a pasture with lot of sun. Legend Old Sanctuary of Meritxell In the late 12th century, on January 6, a wild rose in bloom was found by villagers from Meritxell going to Mass in Canillo. It was out of season and at its base was found a statue of the Virgin and Child. The statue was placed in the Canillo church. However, the statue was found under the same wild rose the next day. The statue was taken to the church of Encamp. However, as before, the statue was again found under the same wild rose on the next day. As in similar legends elsewhere, the villagers of Meritxell took this as a sign and decided to build a new chapel in their town after they found an open space miraculously untouched by the winter snows.

Background One Museum Park (left) and One Museum Park West (right), high- rise condominium apartment buildings in Chicago, Illinois, south of Grant Park, on East Roosevelt Road. Formerly, Central Station was an intercity passenger terminal in downtown Chicago, located at the southern end of Grant Park at Roosevelt Road and Michigan Avenue, which is the northwest corner of the new neighborhood. The neighborhood is evolving according to a City of Chicago planned development. =Planned development= Central Station had been a warehouse district prior to the planned development led by Gerald W. Fogelson, founder and president of Fogelson Companies and co-chairman and CEO of the Central Station Development Corporation. Redevelopment began in 1990. In 1994, Central Station started to take its residential shape with the construction of luxury townhomes. More recently, this lakefront neighborhood has experienced rapid construction of more luxury townhomes, high-rise condominiums, apartments and retail stores. Fogelson proposed a plan to overhaul the warehouse district with a modern residential district and has successfully acquired the property and subcontracted residential, and mixed- use development. Museum Park at Central Station is one of the largest of the subcontracted developments. It is a complex of multiple residential towers within the Central Station development at the southern edge of Grant Park, across Lake Shore Drive from Chicago's Museum Campus. It includes One Museum Park and One Museum Park West as well as Museum Park Place, Museum Park Club, Museum Park Towers I-IV, Museum Park Lofts I & II, 1400 Museum Park and luxury townhomes. Other developments in Central Station include Lakeside Tower at 1600 South Indiana. In 2006, the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, a non-profit organization was formed to provide representation for thousands of South Loop residents, which includes Central Station and Museum Park. In 2017, One Grant Park began construction near Roosevelt Road and Michigan Avenue. Among the earliest residents of the newly redeveloped Central Station was the now-former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.

The battalion traces its history back to 1923, when the garrisons of several towns in the north-west of Ireland (the province of Ulster) were ordered to amalgamate and form the 3rd Infantry Battalion. The 3rd Battalion was one of five Battalions in the army at the start of the Emergency, when it was moved into the newly formed 5th Brigade, along with the 16th and 25th Infantry Battalions. During the Emergency it was responsible for defending the southeast of the country from possible invasion and regularly carried out training exercises. In 1998, the 30th Infantry Battalion was amalgamated into the 3rd Infantry Battalion. Personnel from the battalion have seen service all over the world as part of Irish peacekeeping contingents, both within and outside the structure of the United Nations. Today, the battalion forms part of 1st Brigade, contributing soldiers not only for the defence and security of the Republic of Ireland, but also for deployment overseas. In 2006 the battalion contributed to the formation of the 95th Infantry Battalion, made up of personnel from the then 1st Southern Brigade, which deployed as part of the UNMIL mission to Liberia. The battalion is stationed at Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny. The battalion has served in various UN missions in trouble spots abroad including Congo, Lebanon, Liberia and Cyprus.http://www.curragh.info/articles/3infbn.htm Prior to the re- organisation in 2012, B Company was stationed separately from the rest of the battalion, and served as the training unit for the Mowag Piranha APC, part of the Defence Forces Training Centre.

He studied music at the conservatory in Lille and beginning in 1936 at the Conservatoire de Paris. Dondeyne earned first prize in clarinet, chamber music, harmony, fugue, counterpoint and composition. From 1939 to 1953 he was the solo clarinet with the Musique de l‚Äôair (the French Air Force Band). From 1954-79, he was conductor of La Musique des Gardiens de la Paix (the Paris metropolitan police band). Dondeyne expanded the works of the wind orchestra by his discoveries, his own compositions and with personal encouragement from other composers. The wind orchestra repertory was enriched with compositions from Jacques Cast√©r√®de, Louis Durey, Gabriel Faur√©, Jacques Ibert, Charles Koechlin, Darius Milhaud, Florent Schmitt, Germaine Tailleferre and Kurt Weill. With the Musique des Gardiens de la Paix he traveled throughout Europe and made over 100 recordings (including the famous Anthology of French Marches, produced by Jean-Marie Le Pen), and won several Grand Prix du Disques. He was appointed in 1979 to the governing board of the French Ministry of Culture. He was the director of the conservatory of Issy-les- Moulineaux, a small suburb outside of Paris, from 1980 until 1986. Dondeyne also composed and arranged a large number of compositions from instrumental to symphonic. Recordings with Dondeyne and the Musique des Gardiens de la Paix have been issued in the U.S. on the Calliope, Nonesuch Records and Westminster labels. Included in his recordings are two versions (band, and band with chorus) of Hector Berlioz‚Äôs Grande symphonie fun√®bre et triomphale. Honours Honours bestowed upon Dondeyne included his having been inducted as an honorary life member of the World Association for Bands and Ensembles (WASBE). Death Dondeyne died on 12 February 2015, aged 93.

Although she specializes in fiction, she has published many non-fiction titles, including biographies of Davy Crockett, Louis Pasteur, Dwight Eisenhower, and John Paul Jones, which she co-wrote with her husband Arthur Alphin (as part of Lerner Publishing's History Maker Biographies series). She is noted for writing historical fiction and psychological thrillers. Several of her novels dealt with controversial topics such as serial killers, pedophiles, child abuse, homosexuality, murder, and suicide. At the same time those titles have proven extremely popular with both critics and young readers. Elaine Marie Alphin is one of the subjects of the Contemporary Authors series, a collection of biographies published by Thomson Gale in 2007. In August 2011 Alphin suffered a stroke, which essentially ended her writing career. Her last book was An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank (2010). Alphin died at home in Glenrock, Wyoming on August19, 2014. Themes =Ghosts= Several of Alphin's novels are ghost stories. Two, Ghost Cadet and Ghost Soldier, deal with ghosts of child- soldiers from the American Civil War who require help from present-day children to achieve their final rest. Ghost Cadet has been Mrs. Alphin's most successful book to date, going through several editions in both hardback and paperback. The book's popularity with young readers prompted her publishers to ask for a companion novel ‚Äì Ghost Soldier. In Tournament of Time, one of her early novels, an American school girl living in England befriends the ghosts of two medieval princes, allegedly murdered by Richard III in the Tower of London, and battles the 500-year-old ghost of their murderer. The story has been much praised for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, as well as its thrilling denouement. =Gay characters= The Perfect Shot, Picture Perfect, and Simon Says feature main or secondary characters who happen to be homosexuals. Their sexuality is not central to the plots. =Child abuse= Child abuse and its aftermath is a major theme of Counterfeit Son. It also features pornography in Picture Perfect and, to a lesser extent, The Perfect Shot.

The recording of the liability in the entity's balance sheet is matched to an appropriate expense account in the entity's income statement. In U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), a provision is an expense. Thus, \\"Provision for Income Taxes\\" is an expense in U.S. GAAP but a liability in IFRS.  Under International Financial Reporting Standards  In the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the treatment of provisions (as well as contingent assets and liabilities) is found in IAS 37.  Definition  A provision can be a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A liability, in turn, is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.10 Though it is often thought to be, a provision should not be considered to be a form of savings. Examples are; income tax liability, product warranty, environment restoration, etc...,  Lexicology  Sometimes in IFRS, but not in GAAP, the term reserve is used instead of provision. Such a use is, however, inconsistent with the terminology suggested by International Accounting Standards Board. The term \\"reserve\\" can be a confusing accounting term. In accounting, a reserve is always an account with a credit balance in the entity's equity on the balance sheet, while to some non-accountants (e.g., actuaries), it has the connotation of money set aside to meet a future liability (a debit balance).  Recognition  A provision shall be recognized if the following criteria are fulfilled: * an entity has a present obligation as a result of a past event; * it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; * a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.14 * a specific current statement, the entity will accept certain responsibilities and other parties have valid expectations that the entity will discharge its responsibilities. No provision, however, is recognized for costs that need to be incurred to operate in the future. Also, an obligation always involves another party to whom the obligation is owed (even if this party is unknown).International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.15-16  Executory and onerous contracts  An executory contract is defined as a contract under which neither party has performed any of its obligations (e.g. delivering an object and paying for that object) or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent. In case of an executory contract, IAS 37 does not apply and neither an asset nor a liability is recorded. However, a provision needs to be recognized if the executory contract becomes onerous to the entity. An onerous contract is defined as a contract in which the unavoidable costs resulting from the entity meeting its contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under that contract.International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.10  Restructuring  A restructuring is defined as programm that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either the scope of a business undertaken by an entity, or the manner in which that business is conducted.International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.10 If a restructuring is anticipated, it leads to the recognition of a provision. However, that provision is subject to some specific restrictions: A restructuring provision does not include costs such as the retraining or relocating of continuing staff, marketing, or investment in new systems and distribution networks. This is because these expenditures relate to the future conduct of the business and are thus not liabilities for restructuring to be recognized at the end of the reporting period.International Accounting Standard (IAS) 37.80-81 the objectives of provision are to be for all expenses and losses even when the amount of such  Provision for income tax (United States GAAP)  In American English, the word provision is used as a synonym for \\"expense\\", especially when it appears in a phrase that refers to the income tax cost incurred by a business during an income statement period. In income statements, the appearance of provision for income tax would refer to that expense.

Description The Model 64 is a six-shot double-action revolver with fixed sights chambered in .38 Special. It was the second all stainless steel revolver made by Smith & Wesson, the first being the Smith & Wesson Model 60. It was widely used by several U.S. police, sheriff and state agencies and was a popular choice in high humidity states because the stainless model 64 was more corrosion and rust resistant than the blued Model 10. Originally offered in two variants, a 4\\" taper barrelled square butt or a 2\\" round butt, the Model 64 has since been offered in numerous configurations. The 4\\" heavy barelled version, introduced in 1974, became a favorite with many police agencies. Five variants were made for NYPD and these revolvers are marked \\"NY1\\" as opposed to the more common \\"NYCPD\\" marking for department issued guns as these were intended to be purchased by individual officers. It was the only stainless steel revolver authorized for use by NYPD as well as the last revolver approved for use being replaced by 9mm semiautomatic pistols in 1993.

History =Discovery & early miners= In 1861, the gold commissioner at Rock Creek reported a First Nations account of coarse gold some miles above the Boat Encampment. However, the actual first \\"strike\\" by Europeans is unclear. That year, a party of miners led by Hamilton McKenzie paddled up the Columbia River and wintered near Death Rapids. During 1861‚Äì1862, small teams worked the Columbia bars and its tributaries. Four Frenchmen, who had settled on French Creek in spring 1865, were very successful. To avoid the gold export tax, half the gold leaving for the U.S. was estimated to be unreported. =Context= Gold rushes expanded the colony beyond Vancouver Island onto the mainland. These emanated from the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, the first to dominate the colony's history. A huge influx of miners, drawn from California to the Fraser, dispersed throughout the colony in search of gold. Other rushes during the period were in Rock Creek, Wild Horse Creek, the Cariboo, Omineca, Perry Creek, and Stikine, as well as the Colville and Colorado Gold Rushes. =Access= The upper Columbia was extremely remote. Many prospectors came overland up the Rocky Mountain Trench from what is now Montana, or up the Columbia River from Washington Territory. A regular steamboat service on the Columbia from Marcus, Washington Terr. to La Porte, the head of navigation, began in 1866, but was first attempted in 1865. From Vancouver Island, the route via Portland up the Columbia was also promoted. However, most left the Cariboo goldfields to head eastward along the wagon road to present day Savona, to board a steamer. Maintaining an easterly direction, they crossed Kamloops Lake, passed Fort Kamloops, along the South Thompson River, crossed Little Shuswap Lake, and along the Little River, and across Shuswap Lake (formerly called Big Shuswap Lake). The SS Marten operated the Savona‚ÄìSeymour run to the mouth of the Seymour River. Trails over the Monashee Mountains, familiar to First Nations, led to the Columbia. Seymour to the Columbia was , with snow deep in places. Parties from Kamloops also travelled overland in pack trains, completing the journey down Smith Creek (a.k.a. Gaffney or Kirbyville creek) to the Columbia. =1865‚Äì1866 rush= In 1865, William Downie, an experienced prospector, and his party of ex-Cariboo miners ascended the Columbia from Marcus. They discovered gold in paying quantities at Carnes Creek. Others continued up the Columbia to the Goldstream, and its tributaries, French and McCullough creeks, and were also well rewarded. News spread, and the rush truly began in 1866. Between 8,000‚Äì10,000 flocked to the creeks and valleys. That year, the SS Forty-Nine commenced ferrying miners to La Porte, at the foot of Death Rapids. Conflicting accounts put this at either four or 37 trips from Marcus during the season. The Marten made twice weekly trips to Seymour. Many smaller boats also operated on the Shuswap. During the previous winter, a number of miners had hauled their equipment across the frozen lake. The main ore finds were on the southwestward leg of the river beyond the bend, south from today's Mica Creek. At French Creek City in 1866, Arthur W. Vowell was appointed constable (one of the four colonial constables prior to Confederation), serving for six years. Peter O'Reilly was appointed as gold commissioner, and Walter Moberly laid out the proposed town site. Kirbyville arose on the Goldstream. Prospecting spread from above to below the rapids, venturing along Downie Creek. The mining settlements around French Creek, McCullough Creek, Kirbyville, and Wilson's Landing became sizeable towns with cabins, hotels, stores, saloons, blacksmith shops, laundries, billiard halls, and barber shops. In one incident, 18 miners drowned when a boat capsized in the rapids. =Outcome= By year end, the rush was over. In 1869, 37 miners remained at French Creek, and none on the others creeks. The rush itself had been modest in terms of earnings compared to the Fraser and Cariboo. Big Bend mining activity sporadically occurred later. Most of the goldfields, and what remained of their boomtowns and old mining camps and workings, are now submerged by the reservoirs of Mica Dam or Revelstoke Canyon Dam.

Since her parents spent a lot of time in their store, Greene was raised mainly by her family's African-American housekeeper, Ruth, who was Greene's model for the character of the same name in Greene's debut novel, Summer of My German Soldier (1973). Just before Greene entered high school, her family returned to Memphis. Although she began writing for newspapers during her high school years and even won first prize in a local essay contest, she received poor grades in English because of her difficulties with spelling and punctuation. After graduation, she spent a year studying in Paris, France, an experience that would later serve as the background for Morning Is a Long Time Coming (the 1978 sequel to Summer of My German Soldier). After a year abroad, she returned to Memphis and became a reporter for United Press International. After taking classes at several colleges, Greene enrolled at Columbia University in New York City, where she focused on writing and astronomy. After graduation, she worked as a part-time journalist and a public information officer before marrying physician Donald Sumner Greene and moving with him to Boston. The couple have two grown children; it was after the birth of her daughter Carla that Greene began to write Summer of My German Soldier. The novel took five years to complete; after two more years spent searching for a publisher and eighteen rejections, the book was published by Dial Press in 1973. Greene died on October 2, 2020 in Lakewood Ranch, Florida.

That company was later acquired by Mattel around 1990, then made independent. Today, Corgi consists of three distinct brands that manufacture movie prop replicas, die-cast collectibles, and gift and toy products. Corgi International also distributes trading cards and movie memorabilia through a separate brand. History In July 1977, Zindart International Limited was incorporated in Hong Kong as a limited company under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance initially to operate a manufacturing facility. In February 1997, the company‚Äôs ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In July 1999, the company acquired Corgi Classics Limited, who made the classic diecast cars. Corgi was founded in 1956 in England as Mettoy. It is one of the oldest marketers of collectible die-cast models of lorries, buses, cars and aeroplanes in the world, with its principal markets of its products in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. After renaming the company to Corgi International Limited, in December 2006 the company sold their Zindart Manufacturing division. Corgi also operated a book and paper division, Hua Yang, which Corgi acquired in February 1998 and had sold in May 2004. In December 2006, Corgi acquired Cards Inc. and merged with Master Replicas. After these acquisitions, Corgi began the process of reclassifying product categories and channels of distribution to be more closely aligned with the strategic direction and organization structure of the company. In April 2008, Corgi International sold the Corgi Classics brand, tooling and intellectual property rights to Hornby Hobbies Ltd. This sale did not include licensed properties such as James Bond and Star Trek. Corgi International Limited is a global Pop Culture company, which develops and markets licensed and generic toys, gifts and collectables distributed via direct, specialty, hobby, collector and mass retail channels worldwide. Marketed under the brand names Master Replicas, PopCo and H2go, the Company‚Äôs line of products range from entertainment prop replicas and limited edition memorabilia to traditional toys and gift merchandise. The Company holds varying licenses for entertainment franchises including Disney, Harry Potter, James Bond, Star Trek, Nintendo, Halo and The Beatles, amongst others. Master Replicas The Master Replicas brand (also known as MR) produce movie prop replicas and high end collectibles. Based in Walnut Creek, CA, the company was founded in 2003 by Michael Cookson. Cookson has served as Chairman of Master Replicas since it was founded and chief executive officer since August 2004. Master Replicas develops and markets licensed collectables distributed via direct, specialty, hobby, collector and mass retail channels worldwide. Master Replicas holds varying licenses for entertainment franchises including Star Trek, Disney, James Bond 007, Halo, Nintendo, and The Muppets Previous to January 2008, the company manufactured and sold product under the Star Wars brand before The Company chose not to renew the license upon expiration. While many of their items are props at full-scale (particularly weapons like lightsabers, phasers, and swords), they also make many scale model items, like spaceships, and characters. Master Replicas has also been commissioned to make items for corporations to resell on their own. For example, MR made a 1/6 scale Master Sword and Hylian Shield for Nintendo and Target Stores to coincide with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. =Force FX= Master Replicas is known for their Force FX product line which recreated various lightsabers used in the Star Wars movies. Master Replicas no longer produces this product line but has adapted the technology to replicas of other items including the Halo Energy Sword and Link's Sword from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda. =Closing= Master Replicas closed upon Corgi International expiry. The Master Replicas brand is now owned by Darren Epstein who bought it from the administrators. Cards Inc. Cards Inc., based in Watford, England, was founded by Darren Epstein in 1989 and was a distributor of trading cards and pop culture memorabilia principally in the United Kingdom and Europe. The Cards Inc brand name and its trading card game, sticker, and collectible trading card-based business was sold in April 2008 the remainder of the Cards Inc business continues its distribution of pop culture collectibles under the name of PopCo Distribution. On October 31, 2008, PopCo Distribution was placed into administration, which is the rough equivalent to Chapter 11 reorganization in the United States.

A native of Bowling Green, Kentucky, as a teenager Hogan worked in traveling minstrel shows as a dancer, musician, and comedian. In 1895 Hogan composed several popular songs, including \\"La Pas Ma La\\" and \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\". The success of the latter song created many derogatory imitations, known as \\"coon songs\\" because of their use of racist and stereotypical images of black people. Hogan was considered one of the most talented performers and comedians of his day.Tap Roots: The Early History of Tap Dancing by Mark Knowles, McFarland & Company, 2002, , pages 119-20. His contribution to the racist \\"coon song\\" craze haunted him‚Äîbefore his death he stated that he regretted using the racial slur in his song. Early years He was born Ernest Reuben Crowders, in the Shake Rag District of Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 1865. Little to nothing is known about his childhood, but as a teenager, he traveled with a minstrel troupe called the Georgia Graduate, where he performed as a dancer, musician, and comedian. During this time he changed his name to Hogan because \\"Irish performers were in vogue.\\" He would also claim that he took the name to honor a Judge Hogan of Bowling Green, for whom his mother had worked as a cook. Philip Hale. \\"Singer's Husband Hit with Right.\\" Boston Herald, May 30, 1909, p. E5. A few years after changing his name to Hogan, Ernest starting finding success in solo acts in New York City. Hogan likely performed in blackface during this time, as he sometimes did later in his career. Family life Ernest Hogan was believed to have been married twice. He was first wed to a youthful singer named Mattie Wilkes. She was a popular soprano who had been performing in vaudeville shows with him; they married around 1901 or 1902. \\"Musical Matters.\\" (Washington D.C.) Colored American, August 30, 1902, p. 11. Hogan was later reportedly married to a woman named Louise, who helped him organize concerts in the early 1900s. The specific dates of these marriages are not known; Hogan did not have children with either of his wives. His earliest ragtime composition Sheet music to \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me.\\" Cover for The Missionary Man sheet music (1902). Words and Music by Ernest Hogan, introduced by Gus Hill's Smart Set Co. in Enchantment; (Mattie Wilkes, \\"The phenomenal soprano\\") It was also during this time that Hogan created a comedy dance called the \\"pasmala\\", which consisted of a walk forward with three steps back. In 1895, he wrote and composed a song based on this dance called \\"La Pas Ma La\\". The song's chorus was: :Hand upon yo' head, let your mind roll back, :Back, back back and look at the stars :Stand up rightly, dance it brightly :That's the Pas Ma La. Hogan followed this song with the hit \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\". Hogan was evidently not the originator of the song's lyrics, having appropriated them after hearing a pianist in a Chicago salon playing a song titled \\"All Pimps Look Alike to Me\\".Ragging It: Getting Ragtime into History (and Some History into Ragtime) by Loring White, iUniverse, 2005. xiv, 419 pp. , pages 99-100 Hogan merely changed the words slightly, substituting the word \\"coon\\" for \\"pimp\\"Ragtime: A Musical and Cultural History by Edward A. Berlin, 2002, , page 35. and added a cakewalk syncopation to the music, which he had heard being played in back rooms and cafes.Dvorak to Duke Ellington: A Conductor Explores America's Music and Its African American Roots by Maurice Peress, Oxford University Press, 2003, page 39. The song eventually sold over a million copies. Hogan's use of the racial slur \\"coon\\" in the song infuriated many African Americans. Some black performers made a point of substituting the word \\"boys\\" for \\"coons\\" whenever they sang it. In addition, the success of this song created many imitations, which became known as \\"coon songs\\" because of their use of extremely racist and stereotypical images of blacks. In Hogan's later years he evidently felt shame and a sense of \\"race betrayal\\" for the song. Ironically, the word \\"coon\\" was more socially acceptable than \\"pimp\\" among white audiences of the time. The controversy over the song has, to some degree, caused Hogan to be overlooked as one of the originators of ragtime, which has been called the first truly American musical genre. Hogan's songs were among the first published ragtime songs and the first to use the term \\"rag\\" in their sheet music copy. While Hogan made no claims to having exclusively created ragtime, fellow black musician Tom Fletcher said Hogan was the \\"first to put on paper the kind of rhythm that was being played by non- reading musicians.\\" When the ragtime championship was held as part of the 1900 World Competition in New York, semifinalists played Hogan's \\"All Coons Look Alike to Me\\" to prove their skill.The Music of Black Americans: A History by Eileen Southern, W W Norton & Co Inc, 1983, page 317. As Hogan said shortly before he died, Death In January 1908, Hogan collapsed onstage in New York and again in Boston while performing in \\"The Oyster Man.\\" Forced to leave the show, Hogan spent the remainder of his life trying but failing to recuperate. He died from tuberculosis in Lakewood, New Jersey, on May 20, 1909.

Her advocacy to advance the professional standing of female artists during the late nineteenth century was also a notable achievement. Early life Jane Sutherland was born in New York to Scottish parents; the family emigrated to Sydney in 1864 and moved to Melbourne in 1870.Kerr, Joan (1995) Heritage: The National Woman‚Äôs Art Book. G+B Arts International Limited. p.458. The Sutherland family soon became an important part in the formation of Melbourne‚Äôs cultural influence in Australia.Lindsay, Frances (1977). Sutherland. Victorian College of the Arts. p.2. Uncommon at the time, Sutherland had the support and encouragement from her family to pursue a career as an artist. Due to the support of her family, Sutherland was able to live comfortably as an unmarried, working woman.Kerr, Joan (1995) Heritage: The National Woman‚Äôs Art Book. G+B Arts International Limited. p.458. In the late nineteenth century, there were two contrasting movements concerning women‚Äôs education. The first being the view that a woman‚Äôs role and purpose was reproduction; their importance was valued by their maternal care.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 12. The second view came from the Australian suffragette movement, which not only called for the female right to vote, but the need for equal education to access confidence, achievement and employment. This included the visual arts and gradually saw the inclusion of women into the National Gallery School. The intrepid leader that was Sutherland, had enrolled as early as 1871, a good 14 years before the Women‚Äôs Suffrage Society was formed in Melbourne. Unlike fields such as medicine, the study of visual arts was considered an easier area to transition into as it was already considered a suitable hobby for upper-class women.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 12. The likelihood of female artist being equal to a male artist in commission, exhibitions and respect was harder to gain. Career Obstruction, Box Hill, 1887 From 1878, Sutherland exhibited at the Victorian Academy of Arts, then with the Australian Artists‚Äô Association, and with the Victorian Artists‚Äô Society (from 1888) until 1911. By the standards of the time, she was held in high regard for her artistry, which was supported by the fact she was reviewed on the same terms as male artists, rather than grouped in a general remark of works by lady artists in an exhibition. Critics justified the distinction due to Sutherland‚Äôs landscapes being a comparable to the strong form of male artist‚Äôs work.Peers, Juliet (1999). ‚ÄúThe Leader Amongst the Lady Artists‚Äù. Australian Journal of Art, Volume 14. p. 134. In 1884 she became one of the first women members of the Buonarotti Society, and in 1900 she and May Vale were the first women elected as Councillors of the Victorian Artists‚Äô Society. During her years of active work, she was valued for her efforts in the visual arts scene of Melbourne.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 68. Sutherland was the leading female artist in the group of Melbourne painters who worked outside the studio; she took plein-air sketching trips to the outlying rural districts of Alphington, Templestowe and Box Hill with her male contemporaries of the Heidelberg School. Unlike her contemporaries, Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Charles Conder, Sutherland, as a female, was unable to stay with the men at the campsites overnight, and instead made day journeys to the campsites.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 68. From 1888, Sutherland shared a studio for teaching with artist Clara Southern. The studio at Grosvenor Chambers in Collins Street, Melbourne, was considered a centre for the Heidelberg School with Tom Roberts and Jane Price later securing studios there.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 68. Jane Sutherland and Clara Southern both created works for 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition held in Melbourne, 1889. The exhibition held many works by artists from the Heidelberg School and is considered the beginning of the style known as Australian Impressionism. However, Sutherland‚Äôs and Southern‚Äôs works were not exhibited.Hammond, Victoria and Peers, Juliet (1992). Completing the Picture. Artmovers. p. 13. There is a continuing debate, highlighted by art historians Juliet Peers and Humphrey McQueen, if the exclusion of Sutherland and Southern was due to gender roles of the time or merely that their work did not fit the curator‚Äôs, Elsie Goode, overall vision.Whimpress, Bernard (2013). Heidelberg School. Axiom Distributors. p 12. To the Dandenongs, 1888 Sutherland‚Äôs body of work mainly focus on Australian landscapes with the inclusion of women and children interacting with nature. Narrative is suggestive in her works as she leaves an impression of the land and her figures turn away from the viewer. Despite her efforts and success, Sutherland found difficulties in being considered a serious and professional artist. Sutherland was force to price her paintings at a tenth of the value of her male peers. In one example from 1894 exhibition, Sutherland‚Äôs work To the Dandenong asking price was eighteen guineas, while David Davies sold his piece Moonrise for seventy-five pounds.Burke, Janine (1980). Australian Women Artists 1840-1940. Greenhouse Publications Pty Ltd. p. 29. Illness and death In the early years of the 1900s, Sutherland suffered from a serious stroke and became fully reliant upon the care of her brother, William Sutherland. With William‚Äôs assistance for mobility, Sutherland was able to continue painting and exhibiting her work as well as teach art to a new generation. However, the impact of her illness can be seen by the diminishing the size of her works, from large canvases to small pastels.National Gallery of Victoria (1992). Completing the Picture: Woman Artists and the Heidelberg Era. Artmovers Inc. p. 31. Following William‚Äôs death in 1911, Sutherland was forced to retire and remained so until her death in 1928.Lindsay, Frances (1977). Sutherland. Victorian College of the Arts. p. 3. Unable to paint, it was during these years that she was gradually forgotten during the turn of the century. By the time of her passing on the 28th of July, there was little to no public acknowledgment.Kerr, Joan (1995) Heritage: The National Woman‚Äôs Art Book. G+B Arts International Limited. p.458. Legacy Jane Sutherland was an important figure in a generation of Australian women who chose to create professional careers over marriage and creating a family. Her niece Ruth Sutherland was a painter. While little is known of her personality and motivations, Sutherland‚Äôs art now resides in national institutions for continuous interpretation.

Infantry soldiers are regarded as operational troops who must be prepared for tactical deployment in any location at short notice. In wartime, this means that they will be among the front line troops in the defence of the State. In peacetime however they can be seen daily performing operational duties in Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) such as providing escorts to cash, prisoner or explosive shipments, patrols of vital state installations and border patrols, including check points. The infantry corps consists of a total of seven battalions, a single mechanised company and the Infantry School.  An Ch√©ad Chathl√°n Coisithe  An Ch√©ad Chathl√°n Coisithe (English: The First Infantry Battalion) was established as an Irish language speaking unit in Galway in 1924. The role of An Ch√©ad Chathl√°n Coisithe was seen as very important as far as the status and use of the first official language (Irish) of the State was concerned.http://www.coimisineir.ie/downloads/Sceim_Oglaigh_na_hEireann_Dracht_Deiridh.pdf Defence Forces' Sceme 2006-2009. All the armed forces units except An Ch√©ad Cathl√°n functioned exclusively through the medium of the State's second official language (English). In modern times, the use of Irish as a working language in √ìglaigh na h√âireann would appear to have been abandoned, even in An Ch√©ad Chathl√°n. The then Minister for Defence, Mr O'Toole (on 4 December 1986) presented details regarding the recruitment of native Irish speakers to An Ch√©ad Chathl√°n. These details show that no recruit from a Gaeltacht area was enlisted into the battalion in 1983.Parliamentary Debates , D√°il √âireann Under the 'Defence Forces [sic] Scheme' 2006-2009 ( under Section 11 of the Official Languages Act 2003) √ìglaigh na h√âireann have undertaken to improve the delivery of services in Irish to the public.

Only in Gaeltacht areas is there an onus on √ìglaigh na h√âireann to use Irish as the working language of the force.

She took over in 2001 (from former leader, Yngve H√•gensen) and resigned in 2007 as a result of the so-called Valla affair. In 1997 she briefly served as Norwegian Minister of Justice. Early life Valla grew up on a farm near Bjerka in Hemnes municipality, Nordland. Their father was active in the Norwegian Agrarian Association, and her brother Nils Valla would become a national leader of this organization. Gerd-Liv Valla moved to Hemnesberget to complete her primary education, and to Mo i Rana for upper secondary school. While living in Mo, she competed for Mo IL in middle distance running and set a Northern Norwegian record in the 800 metres. The time was 2:18.1 minutes, achieved in June 1968 on Bislett stadion.Norwegian all-time list, women's 800 metres - Norwegian Athletics Association Education and professional life Valla has a major degree in political science, with minors in social anthropology and public law. She graduated as cand.polit. from the University of Oslo in 1977, and attended the Department of Teacher Education and School Research at the University of Oslo in 1979. She headed the Norwegian Student Union 1974-75\\\\. Valla was politically active in Kommunistisk Universitetslag (KUL), a small communist group. KUL eventually split in 1981 over strong controversy within the group due to differing views on Stalin; Valla supported the pro-Stalin faction within the group during the struggle between the stalinists and the anti-stalinists.Vidar Helgesen: Stalinisten Valla. Article in Minerva (Norwegian periodical) For seven years she was married to historian Harald Berntsen. Together they have a daughter. She has worked both in the trade unions and as first consultant and office leader at the Research Council of Norway, as well as lector at Eik Teacher Academy in T√∏nsberg. In 1997 she was appointed Minister of Justice and the Police in the cabinet Jagland, replacing Anne Holt who left. Valla left the government in late 1997, when Prime Minister Jagland announced his cabinet's resignation as a result of the 36.9 ultimatum and was replaced by the first cabinet Bondevik. The Valla affair In January 2007 Valla was accused of harassment and of having an authoritarian management style by Ingunn Yssen, who had been the director of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions's office for international affairs and previously served as Valla's state secretary in the Ministry of Justice. This became known as the Valla affair and sparked enormous media interest in Valla, generating heated debate over her future as leader of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. On 9 March, under massive pressure, she announced her resignation after an inquiry appointed by the Executive Committee of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions concluded that she had harassed Yssen and that she and LO had violated several Norwegian labor laws. Later in 2007 Valla published a book about the Valla affair, titled Prosessen (after Kafka's The Trial).Prosessen mot Valla in Verdens Gang Also Torstein Tran√∏y and Ingunn Yssen published books about the affair.

PbE is intended to be easier to do than traditional computer programming, which generally requires learning and using a programming language. Many PbE systems have been developed as research prototypes, but few have found widespread real-world application. More recently, PbE has proved to be a useful paradigm for creating scientific work- flows. PbE is used in two independent clients for the BioMOBY protocol: Seahawk and Gbrowse moby. Also the programming by demonstration (PbD) term has been mostly adopted by robotics researchers for teaching new behaviors to the robot through a physical demonstration of the task. The usual distinction in literature between these terms is that in PbE the user gives a prototypical product of the computer execution, such as a row in the desired results of a query; while in PbD the user performs a sequence of actions that the computer must repeat, generalizing it to be used in different data sets. For final users, to automate a workflow in a complex tool (e.g. Photoshop), the most simple case of PbD is the macro recorder.

It is owned by Saumil and Poorvesh Thakkar, through licensee Decatur Media Land, LLC, and is broadcasting an Asian full service format to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Because KVTT uses the same frequency as Class A station KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska; it broadcasts only during the daytime and critical hours. Studios are located in Richardson along east Belt Line Road, and the transmitter is southwest of Alvord in Wise County. History =Early beginnings & transition= This station was first established in 1946 as KFOP on 1140 AM with an unknown format, which ran until 1983 when the station was revamped by its former owners Jerry Snyder and Associates to KJSA (for Jerry Snyder and Associates) with a Nostalgia/Oldies format (known as the \\"Music Of Your Life\\"). 20 years later, it was sold to M&M; Broadcasters and it switched to a classic country format known as \\"The Radio Ranch\\". =Biz Radio affiliation= Biz Radio 1110 logo used from 2008 to 2009 The station traded places with KCLE 1120 and on May 24, 2008, KJSA moved from 1120 to 1110 AM and increased daytime power to 20,000 watts, and the Houston-based Biz Radio Network moved their D/FW broadcasts from KMNY 1360 AM to KJSA. (Another construction permit was on file in the early 2000s to move their broadcasts to Maple Grove, Minnesota; see KJSA info in \\"DFW Radio History - AM Stations\\" site.) Signal testing began in April 2008, with 1360 and 1110 simulcasting BizRadio programming until May 24 and that same day, Biz Radio bought this station from M&M; Broadcasters, although its previous owners still maintained minor ownership of KJSA. BizRadio also leased KTEK (1110 AM) near Houston, which put their programming on the same 1110 frequency in both markets. =Post-Biz Radio= On March 2, 2009, Biz Radio moved to KVCE 1160, licensed to Highland Park, due to complaints that the Biz Radio Network is not picked up in most of the Dallas/Fort Worth area. KJSA switched back to a country music format simulcasting from its sister station KHFX in the weeks preceding the Biz Radio move. On April 14, 2009, KJSA dropped its simulcast with KHFX in favor of a Spanish music format. =KVTT's move to AM= 1110 AM KVTT logo used from October 2009 to July 2010. On September 28, 2009, KJSA began broadcasting a Christian classic/inspirational format by Covenant Educational Media, the former owners of KVTT (91.7 FM, now KKXT), after the sale of the FM frequency to North Texas Public Broadcasting, the owners of KERA radio and KERA-TV. This station formally swapped to the KVTT call sign on October 14, 2009 while the KJSA callsign was warehoused to its former sister station in Palisade, Colorado. From Covenant's studios in North Dallas, the \\"Voice of Truth\\" format included a variety of teaching programs, classic Christian music, and talk programming featuring The Journey with Tom Dooley, The Scott Wilder Show, and Point of View with Kerby Anderson. This format, broadcast since 1976, ceased broadcasting on July 12, 2010, for financial reasons after failing to connect with an audience on their new AM home. The format's official web page, KVTT.com, is deactivated, stating that their \\"account has been suspended\\" prior to shut down. =1110 AM today= After the demise of the brokered religious format, 1110 AM returned to country music programming, this time, airing 1980s and 1990s country with no commercials. On July 27, 2010, the station flipped over to a Tejano music format. After a series of format tryouts, the station switched over to a classic country format with no station IDs except for top of the hour and no commercials. In early 2011, KVTT has increased its Daytime power to 50,000 watts. On June 14, 2011, M&M; Broadcasters sold KVTT to Texoma Broadcasting Inc. for $2.625 Million. On June 14, 2011 station switched over to a classic country and as of 2014 to the AsianTransactions: 6-14-11 - RBR.com format of FunAsia Radio.

It was founded in 1888 and opened in 1891 in a purpose-built building in Kuching, Sarawak. It has been said that naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace encouraged Charles Brooke, the second White Rajah of Sarawak, to establish the museum: there is no evidence for this (Wallace, although he did return to England with Charles (Johnson) in 1862, supported his elder brother, Brooke, when he was disinherited in 1863, so is unlikely to have retained any links). Starting 23 October 2017, the museum is temporarily closed until 2020 for an RM308-million refurbishment works. Only RM28M will be spent on the historic museum building with the rest to be spent on a far larger new museum campus building nearby. Once it is reopened, the museum aims to be one of the finest museums in ASEAN. History The museum in 1896, prior to its extension in 1911. The museum after its extension in 1911. The visit of Alfred Wallace, may have increased Charles Brooke's interest in the natural history of Sarawak to the extent that, since 1878, he asked his officers to collect specimens throughout the state, with a view to building a museum in the future. As the collections began to increase, the specimens were put inside a clock tower at a government office. Then, the specimens were moved to a room above an old vegetable market when Hugh Brooke Low's collections arrived from the Rajang River. The room above the old vegetable market acted as a temporary museum and was open to the public. Finally, the proper Sarawak museum was built in 1889 and opened on 4 August 1891. The museum extended a new wing in 1911. However, the brick work steps outside the old wing was demolished in 1912. The building was built to permanently house and display local indigenous arts and crafts, and collections of local animals. During the Japanese Occupation, the museum was directed by a Japanese officer, who was sympathetic to its goals. He protected it and the museum suffered very little damage or looting. The historic building has been renovated. It is used to exhibit and interpret collections on the natural history of Sarawak. Shell Oil sponsored an exhibit on the petroleum industry, which has been important to Borneo. In addition, it displays archaeological artifacts and reconstructions of examples of the traditional life of the indigenous peoples, and of their arts and crafts. It has the most comprehensive archaeological, natural history, and ethnographic collections on Borneo. Architecture The building has undergone several renovations and alterations since its construction. It is rectangular, 44' √ó 160' with walls and pillars of bricks. The museum building has european-style architecture with its edifice in Queen Anne style. It bears a strong resemblance to the Samuel Way Building of the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital.Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital (including photo)Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital (photo and detail) The galleries are lit by dormer windows on the roof, making wall space available for exhibit displays and collections. Layout The longhouse gallery inside the museum. The ground floor of the museum holds the natural history collection and specimens of Sarawak fauna ‚Äì reptiles, mammals, birds, etc., all expertly prepared and mounted for display. The west wing of the museum houses the Shell exhibition on the petroleum industries of Sarawak. The first floor has exhibits of ethnographic artifacts of the indigenous peoples, such as models of the various types of longhouses, musical instruments, various kinds of fish and animal traps, handicrafts, models of boats and others. Activities The museum has been proclaimed guardian of the national patrimony, with the responsibility to search for, acquire and protect antiquities and historical monuments. The museum director is also responsible for protecting marine turtles and assisting the chief game warden in the conservation of wildlife.

Form The tract takes the form of a catechetical dialogue, or at least begins that way, one interlocutor falling silent about halfway through; of the three surviving versions, version L represents itself as a conversation between two \\"friends in Christ\\"; versions A and H replace this pair with a questioning sister and answering brother and a questioning son and answering father respectively. Life of Soul consists of six questions together with the corresponding answers. The first five questions are introductory, the sixth provokes a lengthy reply that forms the bulk of the tract. The tract begins with the eternal question, \\"How does one get to heaven?\\"; answers, \\"Through Christ who is the life of our soul\\" identifying that life with faith and renunciation of sin; and proceeds to the final question that forms the structural motif for the tract: \\"What are the food and drink that nourish the life of soul?\\" The rest of the text explicates the answer: the soul's bread is faith in Christ and its drink is adherence to his words. Faith in Christ is divided into faith in his divinity and faith in his humanity, the relevant tenets of the creed being listed under each. Christ's words are explained as being summed up in the two commands of love: to love God and one's brother. These two words, it is explained, comprise all ten of the Mosaic ten commandments (duly listed and accounted for); they combat the seven deadly sins (each duly listed, its defeat by love explained); they inspire their adherents to perform the corporal works of mercy(duly listed); and they nourish and are nourished by six virtues: peaceableness, patience, meekness, poverty in spirit, truth, and chastity. Each virtue is then exemplified, largely from the Sermon on the Mount; meekness by, among other things, the Lord's Prayer as the exemplarly prayer of the meek, a device which allows the author to expound the Lord's Prayer. Audience Version L of Life of Soul (the version that forms the basis for available modern editions) appears to have been addressed to a lay audience, version A perhaps adapted for \\"religious\\" (i.e., those who, like monks, live under a rule). Two features of the tract would suit it for a monastic audience: the constant use of the words \\"brother\\" and \\"brethren\\" to describe fellow Christians; and the subject matter of the work: Christian perfection, especially as that is laid out in the so- called \\"Evangelical counsels\\" or \\"counsels of perfection\\" found in Christ's Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-6). According to a considerable tradition, these \\"counsels,\\" too demanding to be imposed on the ordinary believer, are the preserve of those with a calling to the monastic life. But the counsels to perfection were embraced by many individuals and movements that were not monastic; and there is nothing specifically monastic about their interpretation here: the work inculcates faith, good works, and the avoidance of such universal faults as anger, pride, and malicious gossip. Even poverty and chastity are recommended in universal terms. The tract also mentions Christ's strictures against divorce, hardly relevant to monks. It is noteworthy that version A, perhaps adapted for a monastic audience, adds to this section the comment, \\"In order to set us an example of chastity, Christ chose for his lifespan this manner of life [i.e., celibacy], as did many of his apostles.\\" The social class of the audience is similarly difficult to specify. The author addresses remarks to both the poor, who are warned that material poverty in itself is valueless, and the rich, who are warned that wealth used selfishly damns the possessor. These warnings could well be directed toward contemporary society (e.g., toward friars and prelates respectively), rather than toward actual members of the anticipated readership. Contents =Traditional features= Most of the materials of which Life of Soul is composed associate it with the large and diffuse category of catechetical manuals, basic manuals of religious instruction, in which annotated lists of virtues, commandments, works of mercy, etc., are a staple. Seven such enumerations formed the basis of Archbishop Peckham's plans in the previous century to educate the English laity and secular clergy. According to the canons of the Council of Lambeth (1281), every parish priest was to explain these seven to his parishioners four times a year. In 1357, Archbishop John Thoresby issued a similar set of instructions to the clergy of the Province of York, commissioning this time a vernacular version (the so- called \\"Lay-Folks' Catechism\\") which became the religious best seller of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.The Latin version is known as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. For the vernacular version see Thomas Frederick Simmons and Henry Edward Nolloth, ed., The Lay Folks' Catechism..., EETS os 118 (London, 1901). Further see Robert Raymo, \\"Works of Religious and Philosophical Instruction,\\" in J. Burke Severs and Albert E. Hartung, eds., A Manual of the Writings in Middle English 1050-1500, (New Haven, 1967- ) 7:2270-71. A similar set of lists was popularized through the extremely influential contemplative manual by Edmund of Abingdon, the so-called \\"St. Edmund's Mirror,\\" widely distributed in Latin, French, and English versions.See Valerie M. Lagorio and Michael G. Sargent, \\"English Mystical Writings,\\" Manual, 9:3116-17, for a list of the various versions. The Mirror contains chapters, for example, on the seven deadly sins, the seven evangelical virtues (based, like the virtues in our text, on the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount), the twelve articles of the creed, the seven works of mercy, directions on the contemplation of God in his humanity and in his divinity, the seven petitions of the Lord's Prayer, and the ten commandments, of which \\"the first three pertain to the love of God, the latter seven to the love of one's brother.\\"Vernon Manuscript ME version, ed. Carl Horstman, Yorkshire Writers: Richard Rolle of Hampole...and his Followers (London: Swan Sonnenschein, 1895-6), 1:248; Latin versions, ed. Helen P. Forshaw, Edmund of Abingdon: Speculum Religiosorum and Speculum Ecclesie, Auctores Britannici Medii Aevi 3 (London: Oxford University Press, 1973), 60-61. Life of Soul falls somewhere within the vast tradition of devotional manuals which flows from these influential headwaters. According to the taxonomy of the manual tradition proposed by C.A.Martin, Life of Soul is of type 5: instructional manuals that combine the catechetical enumerations with moral and devotional material so as to provide guides to a more perfect way of life.C.A. Martin, \\"Edinburgh University Library 93: An Annotated Edition of Selected Devotional Treatises,\\" diss. Univ. of Edinburgh, 1978; cited by Raymo, \\"Works of...Instruction,\\" 2273. For another attempt to classify some groups of Middle English devotional writings, see the introduction to Peter S. Jolliffe, A Check List of Middle English Prose Writings of Spiritual Guidance (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1974). Life of Soule resists most of the handiest labels and categories. Even the Manual of the Writings in Middle English, compelled by its comprehensive design to place every Middle English work in some category or another, has failed to find a place for the Life of Soul: it does not treat it in volume two as a Wycliffite text, or a Biblical translation, or an instruction for nuns or monks; nor in volume three as a dialogue; nor in volume seven as a work of religious or philosophical instruction, instead directing, \\"for The Lyfe of Soule, a dialogue on the life of Christian perfection intended for both a lay and a religious audience...see the chapter on English Mystical Writings [in volume nine].\\"Severs and Hartung, ed., Manual, vol. 7 (New Haven, 1986), pt. XX (\\"Works of Religious and Philosophical Instruction,\\" by Robert Raymo), p. 2331. But of course Life of Soul does not appear there either. The truth is, the tract enjoys some affinities with each of these categories, though the affinities are stronger with some than with others. The \\"dialogue\\" and \\"mystical\\" categories are probably the least apt: the dialogue form contributes little to the work and fades almost completely away by the end. And as for mysticism, at best, Life of Soul belongs among those works of religious devotion that invoke affective themes in pursuit of a basically didactic or catechetical end, such as the Mirror of Life (Speculum Vitae),Most readily available in its prose version entitled \\"A Mirror for Laymen and -women\\": Venetia Nelson, ed., A Myrour to Lewde Men and Wymmen: A Prose Version of the Speculum Vitae, Middle English Texts (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1981). See Raymo, \\"Works of...Instruction,\\" p. 2262 and Valerie M. Lagorio and Michael G. Sargent, \\"English Mystical Writings,\\" Manual, pt. XXIII, 9:3096-98. the Abbey of the Holy Ghost,See Raymo, \\"Works of...Instruction,\\" pp. 2340-41. or even The Imitation of Christ.John K. Ingram, ed.,The Earliest English Translation of...the De Imitatio Christi, Early English Text Society Extra Series 63 (London, 1893). The only thing mystical about the Life of Soul lies in its insistence on connecting motive and behavior, on enumerating commandments and virtues not as duties to be performed or habits to be formed so much as symptoms of an underlying ardent love for God and, through God, one's neighbor, which must be cultivated by the devout Christian‚Äîa theme that looms large among the established mystical or quasi-mystical English authors, especially Richard Rolle and Walter Hilton, but far from exclusively so. Life of Soul shows no interest in contemplation or extraordinary spiritual experience, its interest being rather in normative experiences of faith and love. Nor is it interested in distinguishing the active from the contemplative life, or, indeed, in any of the various approaches to knowing God that found favor among the English mystics. =Distinctive features= Given the bulk and inaccessibility of the comparative material, it is difficult to be sure how distinctive Life of Soul is. Most unusual, perhaps, are its structure and manner of argument. The structure is based on an elaborate set of associations that link every basic aspect of Christian dogma and practice, with the notable exception of the seven sacraments (penance in particular being notable for its absence), with the inner spiritual life of love and faith. The association of the ten commandments with the two gospel precepts of love was made already by Jesus and by Paul, and is a constant feature of treatises on the commandments. But the expansion of this scheme that Life of Soul employs, managing to stretch the precepts to subsume the evangelical virtues (idiosyncratically listed), the works of mercy, the seven deadly sins, and even the Lord's Prayer, is probably unique, as is its identification of works (as expressed in the two gospel precepts) and faith (as expressed in the creed) with the \\"drink\\" and \\"bread\\" that nourish the life of soul. The other notable feature of the tract is its extreme reliance on the Bible to carry its argument. The Bible is cited frequently, at length, and to the exclusion of all other authorities, to the extent that over half of the book consists of Biblical quotations. The translation is usually accurate and idiomatic. Although it cannot be identified with any of the extant Middle English translations, it does often bear a close resemblance to the southern prose version of ca. 1388 edited by Anna Paues.Anna C. Paues, A Fourteenth Century English Biblical Version (Cambridge, 1904). On ME Biblical translations, see: Margaret Deanesly, The Lollard Bible and Other Medieval Biblical Versions (Cambridge, 1920); Laurence Muir, \\"Translations and Paraphrases of the Bible, and Commentaries,\\" Manual, 2:398-403; and Anne Hudson, \\"Wycliffite Prose,\\" in Middle English Prose: A Critical Guide to Major Authors and Genres, ed. A. S. G. Edwards (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1984), pp. 252-255. That the biblicism of Life of Soul affects not only its outright quotations but also most of its diction and metaphor will be apparent to most readers. The audience is probably expected to recognize allusions to the \\"wedding garment\\" or the \\"house built upon a foundation of stone.\\" Parallels The text edited by Anna Paues provides also one of a number of specific parallels with other tracts that may help in tracing the affiliations of Life of Soul. The Bible translation is preceded by a \\"Prologue\\" in dialogue form that contains some of the same arguments as those used by Life of Soul to ask and answer the question: is it right to share the mysteries of theology with laymen? Both questioners, for example, cite the parable of the faithful and unfaithful servants, the faithful servant being the one who did not clutch his lord's treasure to himself but put it out for trading, buying and selling: so should the theologian do with his theological treasure.Paues, Biblical Version, pp. 6-7. Even closer parallels have been noted between the ten commandments section of Life of Soul and the corresponding section of the compendious tract called Poor Wretch (Pore Caitif). The material is very traditional, and a common source may well be involved, but some connection is demonstrable from the often verbatim correspondence. Finally, it is hard to avoid comparison of Life of Soul with the idiosyncratic and personal treatise called Book to a Mother.Adrian James McCarthy, ed., Book to a Mother: An Edition with Commentary, Salzburg Studies in English Literature; Elizabethan & Renaissance Studies 92; Studies in the English Mystics 1 (Salzburg: Institut f√ºr Anglistik und Amerikanistik, 1981). Both stress the importance of personal devotion and a life of perfection, both incorporate the catechetical lists, and both are heavily Biblical in content. Orthodoxy The emphasis on lay piety and Biblical translation together have caused some to doubt the orthodoxy of both books; indeed, Pore Caitif, Book to a Mother, and Life of Soul have all aroused suspicions of sympathies with the Lollard movement. After the 1407 prohibition by Bishop Arundel of lay ownership of the Scriptures in English, possession of either Life of Soul or Book to a Mother could have been grounds for suspicion or even prosecution. Moreover, four other features of Life of Soul raise suspicions of heterodoxy: # Oaths. In explicating the virtue of \\"truth,\\" Life of Soul issues a blanket dismissal of oath-taking: \\"among true men there is no need for oaths.\\" The host in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales was not the only one able to scent \\"a loller in the wynd\\" when oath-taking was condemned.Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, \\"Man of Law's Tale\\" [Epilogue], II(B1).1168-77. If carried out in practice, such a prohibition would be socially disruptive, if not revolutionary, and it was so regarded when mentioned as a symptom of Lollard sympathies. The tract's statement is bare and brief, and could be taken as an abbreviated form of some more balanced position such as that taken by the Wycliffite Lantern of LightLillian M. Swinburn, ed., The Lanterne of Light, Early English Text Society 151 (London, 1917), p. 89. or the radically reformist but orthodox Dives and Pauper.Priscilla Heath Barnum, ed., Dives and Pauper, vol. 1 in two parts, Early English Text Society 275 & 280 (London, 1976 & 1980) 1:229-232. But as stated, the position of our tract is that of the Lollards.Anne Hudson, The Premature Reformation: Wycliffite Texts and Lollard History (Oxford, 1988), pp. 371-74. It is worth noting, too, that \\"true men\\" was evidently the Lollards' own favorite name for themselves.Anne Hudson, \\"A Lollard Sect Vocabulary?\\" in: So meny people longages and tonges: Philological Essays in Scots and mediaeval English presented to Angus McIntosh, ed. Michael Benskin and M. L. Samuels (Edinburgh, 1981), pp. 15-30; rpt. in Lollards and their Books (London: Hambledon Press, 1985), pp. 165-80. # Peaceableness or pacifism? Peaceableness is certainly well established as an orthodox Christian virtue, but its socially disruptive extension to outright pacifism has always been treated with more suspicion. Pacifism was only intermittently part of the Lollard ideology‚Äîbut it is worth noting that the section on peaceableness is the one replaced in the H and A versions of Life of Soul.Hudson, Premature Reformation, 368-70. # A memorial view of the eucharist. If the author held an orthodox Catholic view of the eucharist, he is remarkably reticent about it. Both the words of institution (\\"This is my body\\") and the more explicit words of John 6 about eating the flesh of Christ are quoted, but are consistently interpreted symbolically, or so it would seem; and the events of the last supper itself, when mentioned, are referred to as something done in order that we might remember. There is nothing explicitly heterodox, and no polemic, but like many Lollard confessions, the tract is \\"more significant for what it did not say than for what it did.\\"Hudson, Premature Reformation, 283. A more or less spiritualized or memorial view of the eucharist was prevalent among the Lollards; as late as 1499 we find words in a Lollard's confession that echo our text: \\"Whosoever receive devoutly God's word, he receiveth the very body of Christ.\\"Hudson, Premature Reformation, 285. # Dominion. Among the potentially most revolutionary of Wyclif's ideas was that \\"dominion\\"the right to rule and own‚Äîdepended on the righteousness of the ruler and owner; and a truly righteous owner would be inclined to give his wealth away. \\"Lords of this world who do not truly serve God, steal God's goods, for the things that they possess they have without his leaveand then they are thieves.\\"Hudson, Premature Reformation, 4. Lollardy derived from this theory a political program of disendowment for the clergy and a personal ideal of simple poverty divested of all wealth beyond that needed for survival. The interpretation of \\"poor in spirit\\" given by Life of Soul appears to be in harmony with those views: \\"Someone who holds onto God's goods in his keeping in order to spend them on his own desire, where there is no need, it is certain that he holds these goods against God's will, and then he is a thief that robs God of his goods.\\" None of these points is conclusive, but together they strongly suggest an author at least sympathetic to Wycliffite views. Versions and manuscript context The three versions of Life of Soul appear each in a single manuscript: version L in the Bodleian Library (Oxford) manuscript Laud Misc. 210, folios 114r-132v; version A in the British Library (London) manuscript Arundel 286, folios 115r-129r; and version H in the Huntington Library (California) manuscript HM 502, folios 35r-60v. Version L is the most complete; version H has some material not in L, which may be original, or may represent expansions; and version A is a severely abridged version. The manuscripts in which all three appear are all orthodox compilations of devotional material, in L and H often material of lay interest. \\"L,\\" for example, includes Book to a Mother, Rolle's Form of Living, the Sixteen Points of Charity, and The Abbey of the Holy Ghost, another tract that (as Gillespie says) \\"is intended for people seeking a 'relygyon of the herte'\\";Vincent Gillespie, review of The Lyfe of Soule: an Edition with Commentary by Helen M. Moon, Medium Aevum 50.2 (1981): 348-349. \\"H,\\" Rolle again and St. Edmund's Mirror; and \\"A,\\" the manuscript likely intended for a monastic audience, a commendation of virginity, several pseudo-Rolle works largely Anselmian or Victorine in origin, a tract on the ten commandments, and a set of contemplations on the liturgical hours. Aside from the differences of personnel and audience mentioned above, the three versions differ somewhat in the dialect of their English. The text's sole editor (Moon) locates versions L and H in the London area or points south, A farther north and west (and calls it perhaps a little more recent than the others). But the Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediaeval English locates the scribal practices of both A and H in Warwickshire.A. McIntosh, M.L. Samuels and M.

Early life Rudd was born in Camp Verde, Arizona. A 1939 graduate of Clarkdale High School in Clarkdale, Arizona, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1942 and served as a fighter pilot during World War II. After his discharge in 1946, he attended Arizona State College, from which he graduated in 1947, and the University of Arizona Law School in Tucson. Years in FBI After a brief period in private practice, Rudd became a special agent for the FBI in 1950. As the only FBI field agent in Washington, D.C., fluent in Spanish in 1954, Rudd participated in the interrogation of the Puerto Rican nationalists involved in the attack on the US House of Representatives that year. His report impressed Director J. Edgar Hoover, who offered Rudd his next choice of assignment, which he received as U.S. legal attach√© at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, where he served from 1960 to 1970. When assassin Lee Harvey Oswald shot and killed President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, Rudd was ordered by Hoover to collect from the Mexican government their law enforcement and intelligence files on Lee Harvey Oswald, including files relating to Oswald's connections to the pro-Fidel Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, Oswald's several trips to and from Cuba, and his arrest in Mexico City. Rudd obtained Oswald's file from the Mexican government and flew a Cessna aircraft from Mexico City to Dallas, Texas, to provide the documents to FBI officials in Dallas as Kennedy's body was on its way to Washington, D.C. with Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and widow Jacqueline Kennedy. Political career After leaving the FBI in 1970, Rudd moved to Arizona, where he became involved in politics. He was elected to the board of supervisors for Maricopa County in 1972. Four years later, he won election to the House of Representatives for Arizona's 4th congressional district, which then comprised the entire northeastern portion of the state. However, the bulk of its population was in the northern portion of the Valley of the Sun. He defeated Democrat Tony Mason by only 707 votes. While Mason carried four of the district's five counties, he could not overcome a 17,100-vote deficit in the district's share of Maricopa County, which had more people than the rest of the district combined. He was easily re-elected four times, each time with more than 60 percent of the vote, and in 1984, he was completely unopposed. Rudd was a fiscal conservative, an orthodox Catholic, and a member of the important Appropriations Committee for five years; he opposed the expenditure of federal taxpayer dollars for abortions. A staunch anticommunist, Rudd was a tireless supporter of US anticommunist efforts in Central and South America, and he was the last American to visit with Nicaraguan President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was killed by Sandinista forces. During the 1980 presidential election, Rudd, with help from FBI colleagues with access to security officials at the White House, allegedly obtained debate preparation documents prepared for President Jimmy Carter for his election debates against Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and provided the so-called \\"Carter debate papers\\" to the Reagan presidential campaign in the Debategate scandal. Later years Rudd retired from Congress in 1987 and took a position with the Salt River Project. Remaining active in Republican politics, he served as campaign manager for Doug Wead during Wead's unsuccessful 1992 run for Arizona's 6th congressional district. Rudd died in Scottsdale, Arizona; his remains were cremated, with the ashes interred in the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona.

Ulvhild had an important role in the Nordic dynastic connections of her time, but the sources are insufficient on detailed circumstances. She is mentioned as a femme fatale of high-medieval Scandinavia, as well as a benefactor of the Catholic Church. Early life Ulvhild originated from Norway. The Norse saga manuscript Fagrskinna mentions her as the daughter of the Norwegian magnate Haakon Finnsson, of the Thjotta family. The name of her mother has not been preserved to later centuries. In modern times it has been suggested that her mother was the former Norwegian and Danish queen Margaret Fredkulla, daughter of Inge I of Sweden.Adolf Sch√ºck, \\"Drottning Ulvhilds h√§rkomst\\", Personhistorisk tidskrift, 1953, pp. 29-30. http://personhistoriskasamfundet.org/1950-1970/ However, this hypothesis cannot be substantiated. Marriages Young Ulvhild was firstly married to King Inge II of Sweden, in about 1116/17. They appear not to have had children. Inge was the junior of two reigning brothers. The elder brother, King Philip died in 1118 under unknown circumstances, leaving Inge as the sole ruler. The short chronicle in the Westrogothic law says that King Inge died of an evil drink in √ñsterg√∂tland. Some later sources place the assassination in Vreta Abbey. The year is not known, but it was no later than c. 1129.Peter Sawyer. N√§r Sverige blev Sverige. Alings√•s: Viktoria, 1991, pp. 38-9. The writer √Öke Ohlmarks has speculated that Ulvhild became acquainted with her future husband, the East Geatic magnate Sverker, and made him poison Inge.√Öke Ohlmarks, Alla Sveriges kungar. Stockholm; Gebers, 1972, p. 36. Some time after the death of King Inge, Ulvhild moved to Denmark, rather than returning to Norway. Perhaps she did so to claim asylum: she seems to have had relatives and allies in Denmark, whereas political turbulence plagued Sweden.Dick Harrison, Sveriges historia 600-1350. Stockholm: Norstedts, 2009, p. 210. She married King Niels of Denmark after the death of his first queen, Margaret Fredkulla of Sweden, in c. 1130. The marriage more or less coincided with Niels's son Magnus the Strong being accepted as king in parts of Sweden. However, Ulvhild egged her stepson Magnus against his cousin and rival Canute Lavard.Adolf Sch√ºck, \\"Drottning Ulvhilds h√§rkomst\\", Personhistorisk tidskrift, 1953, p. 27. http://personhistoriskasamfundet.org/1950-1970/ Canute was eventually murdered by Magnus in 1131. Civil war now broke out in Denmark, where Niels and Magnus stood against the claimant Eric Emun. Moreover, the marriage was not harmonious, and Niels was some 20‚Äì30 years older than his spouse. The chronicler Saxo Grammaticus informs us of the dramatic dissolution: :\\"Meanwhile the Swedes, when they heard that Magnus was busy with war in Denmark, took a fellow countryman called Sverker, a man of low origins, as their king; not since they valued him that much, but since they would not stand under a foreigner. Since they were used to having one of their own at the head, they could not accept having a foreigner as chief. Niels had married Ulvhild from Norway after Margaret's death. Sverker sent errands to her and asked for her love. Shortly afterwards he clandestinely brought her from her husband and made her marry him. With this mistress whom he falsely called his wedded wife, he sired a son Charles who became king after him.\\"Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike. K√∏benhavn; Asschenfeldt's Stjerneb√∏ger, 1985, II, pp. 81. The event is not dated but must have taken place between 1132 and 1134. The curious elopement story may be explained by Ulvhild's position. Being the widow of Inge II, she represented the estates and influences of the extinct House of Stenkil. Marriage to Ulvhild legitimated the enthronement of the non-royal grandee Sverker, now when her stepson Magnus had been evicted from Sweden. As far as known, no objections (apart from the partial Saxo) were made against her third marriage or against the legitimacy of her children. On the contrary, Ulvhild is praised by clerical sources as a benefactor to the church. The Cistercians were called in on Ulvhild's initiative, and founded the abbeys of Alvastra and Nydala in 1143.Sven Tunberg, Sveriges historia till v√•ra dagar. Andra delen. √Ñldre medeltiden. Stockholm: P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners F√∂rlag, 1926, p. 41; Dick Harrison, Sveriges historia 600-1350. Stockholm: Norstedts, 2009, p. 174. Alvasta was even founded on ground which was part of Sverker's bridal gift to Ulvhild.Sven Tunberg, Sveriges historia till v√•ra dagar. Andra delen. √Ñldre medeltiden. Stockholm: P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners F√∂rlag, 1926, p. 41. After at least a decade of queenship, Ulvhild died, some time between 1143 and 1150. Sverker married secondly with Rikissa of Poland, widow of Magnus, king of Gothenland, Sverker's earlier rival and opponent. This, too, was a politically motivated marriage which may have aimed to draw the last remains of Magnus's party to Sverker.Sawyer, Peter. N√§r Sverige blev Sverige. Alings√•s: Viktoria, 1991, p. 42. Children and family Ulvhild was married three times; to King Inge II of Sweden in c. 1117, to King Niels of Denmark in c. 1130, and to King Sverker I of Sweden in c. 1134. She had at least two surviving sons and two surviving daughters, all born of her third marriage with Sverker: * Helena, (fl. 1157), Queen consort of Denmark, in 1156 married to king Canute V of Denmark, Rikissa's son. Later nun in Vreta Abbey. * Jon Sverkersson of Sweden, (d. c. 1152), mentioned as jarl, but killed by peasants during last years of his father Sverker. * Charles VII of Sweden, (d. 1167), who after his father's murder held (parts of) Gothenland, was possibly called jarl and certainly considered his father's heir and dynastical successor, but ultimately succeeded to the throne of Sweden after their dynasty's rivals Eric IX and Magnus II, as King Charles VII of Sweden. * Ingegerd Sverkersdotter (d. 1204), Abbess of Vreta Abbey Some genealogies have it that Sune Sik was a younger son of King Sverker, being the father of Ingrid Ylva; it is fully possible that he was also a son of Ulvhild.

Its international branches, Bandai Namco Entertainment America and Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, are respectively headquartered in Santa Clara, California and Lyon, France. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings. Bandai Namco Entertainment was formed on March 31, 2006, following a corporate merge between Namco and Bandai on September 29 of the previous year. Originally known as Namco Bandai Games, they merged both Bandai Games and Namco Networks in January to create a North America division, Namco Bandai Games America. Namco Bandai Games absorbed Banpresto's video game division in 2008, and dissolving Bandai Networks in 2009. Development operations were spun-off into a new company in 2012, Namco Bandai Studios, to help create faster development time and tighter cohesion between development teams. The company was renamed to Bandai Namco Games in 2014 and again to Bandai Namco Entertainment a year later. Bandai Namco Entertainment owns several multi-million video game franchises, including Gundam, Pac-Man, Tekken, Soulcalibur, Tales, Ace Combat, Taiko no Tatsujin, The Idolmaster and Dark Souls. It is the third largest video game publisher in Japan by revenue and the seventh in the world. The company also owns the licenses to several Japanese media franchises such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, Sword Art Online and Naruto. It is the core publishing and development area of the Bandai Namco Group's \\"Content Strategic Business Unit (Content SBU), and the main video game branch of Bandai Namco Holdings. History Bandai Namco's former headquarters. In February 2005, in the wake of their 50th anniversary, Namco announced their intent to merge with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings. The merge was finalized on September 25, creating the third-largest video game publisher in Japan by revenue. Bandai purchased Namco for US$1.7 billion, with Namco receiving 43% of shares and Bandai receiving the other 57%. Both companies in a joint statement cited Japan's decreasing birth rates and advancements in technology as the reason for the merge, and to increase their relevance to newer audiences. Both companies worked independently under the newly formed Bandai Namco Holdings until March 31, 2006, when their video game operations were merged to form Namco Bandai Games. Earlier on January 26, Namco Hometek and Bandai Games merged to form Namco Bandai Games America, the North American division. On 1 April 2008, Banpresto's video game operations were absorbed by Namco Bandai Games. On 1 April 2009, Bandai Networks, Namco Bandai's mobile phone business, was dissolved and absorbed into Namco Bandai Games. Just prior to the release of Afro Samurai at the end of 2008, the company announced the Surge publishing label. The new label was an attempt at creating a separate identity for the company, aimed at a Western audience desiring more mature themes in game content. Following Afro, early press materials indicated that Dead to Rights: Retribution and Splatterhouse would also be released under the Surge label, but neither game ultimately did; both were released with a retro Namco label instead to reflect the series' legacy. In 2010, Namco Bandai Games entered the Guinness World Records as the company that released the most TV commercials for the same product, a Nintendo DS game called Solatorobo: Red the Hunter. They created 100 versions of the ad as the game consists of 100 chapters. In early 2011, Namco Networks was absorbed into Namco Bandai Games America, effectively consolidating Namco Bandai's American console, handheld, and mobile video game development operations. On 2 April 2012, Namco Bandai Games spun off its development operations into a new company called Namco Bandai Studios. The new company was spurred by Namco Bandai's interest in faster development times and tighter cohesion between disparate development teams. It comprises approximately 1,000 employees, who were already part of Namco Bandai. In March 2013, Namco Bandai Games established two new game studios. The first, Namco Bandai Studios Singapore, is Namco Bandai's \\"leading development center\\" in Asia and develops game content for the Asia Pacific market. The second studio, Namco Bandai Studios Vancouver, works on online social games and game content development for North America and Europe, and is part of the Center for Digital Media (CDM). In July 2013, Namco Bandai Partners (NBP), which used to oversee the PAL distribution network since September 2012, merged with Namco Bandai Games Europe (NBGE) in order to push distribution and publishing into one entity, Namco Bandai Games Europe (NBGE). In 2014, Namco Bandai Games and Namco Bandai Studios became Bandai Namco Games and Bandai Namco Studios, respectively.

They were purchased from Anzani with a Squire emblem cast into them. Blown versions were available. Very few were made, but it held a reputation for exceptional top speed and braking. Squire designed and built a fine rigid chassis offered in two lengths for two or four seat versions with attractive bodywork by Vanden Plas. The car was too expensive even with cheaper bodywork from Markham of Reading, and financial difficulties ended production in 1936. A Vanden Plas two seater cost ¬£1,220 which was Bugatti money and even the Markham cost ¬£995. Squire himself went on to join Lagonda and was working for the Bristol Aeroplane Company when killed in an air raid in 1940. Two or possibly three more cars were assembled from left over parts by Valfried Zethrin in 1938 and 1939. There were plans to resume production after the war but the lack of patterns to make the engine made this uneconomical. After the war Val Zethrin pursued a new project, an updated and simplified attempt at the Squire concept, called the Zethrin Rennsport. The reliability and cost of the R1 Anzani engine had always been an issue, and post-war conditions rendered it unthinkable. Through Benjamin Bowden and John Allen's design company, contact was made with Donald Healey, who recommended using a souped up Riley Motor engine, as he had employed in the Healey-Abbott¬∑ Suspension and modified frame from the Riley stable provided the back-bone for what was to be an interesting but doomed venture.Car and Driver Magazine October 1967 180 bhp from the heavily modified engine was forecast, coupled to a fairly advanced body, suggesting that a 135 mph maximum speed was achievable. It seems that this project went little further than a road-going prototype with rudimentary bodywork. Zethrin did not have the technical expertise of Adrian Squire, and failed to ensure sufficient industry interest in what seemed a flight of fancy, in an era of austerity. Lack of funds and backers falling away put paid to the Rennsport becoming available for purchase. See also * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom  Notes   References  3\\\\.

Ambras Castle is above sea level.Ambras Castle Elevation and Location Considered one of the most popular tourist attractions of the Tyrol, Ambras Castle was built in the 16th century on the spot of an earlier 10th-century castle, which became the seat of power for the Counts of Andechs. The cultural and historical importance of the castle is closely connected with Archduke Ferdinand II (1529‚Äì1595) and served as his family residence from 1567 to 1595. Ferdinand was one of history's most prominent collectors of art. The princely sovereign of Tyrol, son of Emperor Ferdinand I, ordered that the medieval fortress at Ambras be turned into a Renaissance castle as a gift for his wife Philippine Welser. The cultured humanist from the House of Habsburg accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum: The collections, still in the Lower Castle built specifically for that museum purpose, make Castle Ambras Innsbruck one the oldest museums in the world. The Lower Castle contains armouries that feature masterpieces of the European armourer's art from the time of Emperor Maximilian I to Emperor Leopold I. As the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the \\"Kunst- und Wunderkammer\\" (Chamber of Art and Wonders) represents an unrivalled cultural monument. Above the Lower Castle is the famous Spanish Hall (Spanischer Saal), a notable example of German Renaissance architecture, which contains an intricate wood-inlay ceiling and walls adorned with 27 full-length portraits of the rulers of Tyrol.Bousfield 2008, p. 472. The Upper Castle contains the extensive Habsburg Portrait gallery (Habsburger Portr√§tgalerie) featuring paintings of numerous members of the House of AustriaBousfield 2008, pp. 472‚Äì473. and other leading ruling Europeaen dynasties, including, as a remarkable feature, many portraits of princely children. History Long before Innsbruck became a city, references to an Amras or Omras appeared in documents dating from the 10th century. This early fortification in what was then the southwest corner of Bavaria was the seat of power of the Counts of Andechs, who became Margraves of Istria and later Dukes of the short-lived Imperial State of Merania from 1180 to 1248. This original fortification was destroyed in 1133 and no traces of it remain, although some of the material from the original structure was later used in the modern building. In 1248, the castle ruins and property passed by inheritance from the Counts of Andechs to Count Albert IV of Tyrol. Ambras CastleThe modern Ambras Castle was built by Archduke Ferdinand II (1529‚Äì1595), the second son of Emperor Ferdinand I. When he was made provincial sovereign of Tyrol in 1564, Ferdinand II ordered two Italian architects to turn the existing medieval fortress into a Renaissance castle for his untitled wife Philippine Welser (1527‚Äì1580), whom he had married in secret. Ferdinand II prepared his family's residence in the Upper Castle, beneath which he constructed one of the most artistically important halls of the late Renaissance‚Äîknown as the \\"Spanish Hall\\" since the nineteenth century. In 1567, Ferdinand II made his entry into Innsbruck, prior to that, he was appointed administrating governor to the Kingdom of Bohemia, taking up residence in Prague in 1547. In 1589, he added an additional building, the Heldenr√ºstkammer, west of the Lower Castle for the purpose of housing his collection of \\"Heroes\\", the very first systematic presentation of objects in the history of museums. Ambras Castle was used as the residence of Philippine as well as a place for Ferdinand II to house his collection of weapons, suits of armour, portraits, natural objects, as well as rarities and precious objects. Today, the art history museum Schloss Ambras Innsbruck is part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna. Philippine became a popular and beloved figure through her charity and willingness to help others, particularly the common people of Tyrol. Even the nobility brought their petitions to the former commoner. As signs of affection, people addressed their written petitions to \\"Merciful Miss\\" or \\"serene Princess Mrs. Philippine of Austria\\". After Ferdinand's death in 1595, the second son of Ferdinand and Philippine, Margrave Charles of Burgau, inherited Ambras Castle. With little interest in preserving the castle or its collections, they fell into a state of dilapidation and Charles sold them in 1606 to Emperor Rudolf II. The emperor residing in Prague left his uncle's collection nearly in its entirety at Ambras Castle, as he himself was one of the most important Habsburg collectors. Ambras Castle In the following years, Ambras Castle no longer had the status of an official residence and was seldom lived in. Inadequate preservation measures led to the loss of valuable books, manuscripts, and hand sketches, and soon the palace fell largely into disrepair. In the seventeenth century, Emperor Leopold I (1640‚Äì1705) had some of the most valuable holdings of the Ambras collections‚Äîmostly books and manuscripts‚Äîmoved to Vienna, where they can still be seen at the Austrian National Library. In 1805, the remaining Ambras collections were threatened by the defeat of Austria by the French Empire. Fortunately, after he recognized the private-law character of the Ambras collection, Napoleon (1769‚Äì1821) had it brought to safety in Vienna. In 1855, Archduke Karl Ludwig, then governor of Tyrol, had the palace remodeled to use as a summer residence. Significant changes were made during this time to the palace and the surrounding park. The Outer Bailey (Vorschloss) was constructed with an ivy-clad entrance ramp for carriages. The park was redesigned as an English garden. Following Archduke Karl Ludwig's renouncement of his succession rights in 1889, the palace fell once again into ruinous condition. In 1880, it was converted into a museum and subsequently renovated. In 1919, following the dissolution of the Austria- Hungary Empire, Ambras Castle became the property of the Republic of Austria. In 1950, the Kunsthistorisches Museum took over the administration of the castle and its collections. Throughout the 1970s, a comprehensive restoration took place of the Spanish Hall, the Upper Castle residential quarters, and the inner courtyard. In 1974, the Chamber of Art and Wonders was completed. In 1976, the Habsburg Portrait Gallery covering the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries was completed. In 1981, the Armouries was reopened in the Lower Castle. Collections Spanish Hall Schloss Ambras Innsbruck is a federal museum of the Republic of Austria. It is administratively part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna and belongs to the KHM-Museumsverband. Ferdinand II was one of the most important patrons of the Habsburg family. He founded the notable collections of Ambras and had a museum built for them in the rooms of the \\"Lower Castle\\", which was constructed according to the most advanced ideas of his time. The three Armouries and the Chamber of Art and Wonders were designed and used as a museum from the beginning. =Spanish Hall= The Spanish Hall, built between 1569 and 1572, is one of the most important freestanding halls of the Renaissance. The picturesque lay-out of the long hall is dominated by the 27 full-length portraits of the princely rulers of the Tyrol. Today rather famous classical concerts take place in this hall. =Chamber of Art and Wonders= The Chamber of Art and Wonders of Archduke Ferdinand II is the only Renaissance Kunstkammer which can still be seen in its original place. Others had been plundered like the ones in Munich, Prague or Stuttgart, or their character had been changed like in Dresden or Kassel. In the Chamber of Art and Wonders at Ambras Castle artificialia, naturalia, scientifica, exotica, and mirabilia are to be seen: natural wonders (rare, unique and excellent things of nature) as well as precious objects, scientific items, toys, or luxury items of the time, and so on. In contents the natural and artistic objects represent the programme of the late Renaissance encyclopedic collections. The special thing about the Ambras- collections is, that they are still where they were meant to be seen. Still you can find corals arranged in cabinet-boxes, turnery made of wood or ivory, glass figures, or porcelain and silk paintings which belong to the oldest European collections of Asian, African and American art (exotica). Also important works of European artists, like the carved \\"little death\\" made of wood by Hans Leinberger can be found, as well as typical Kunstkammer - objects like handstones, goblets made of rhinoceros horn, coconut or rock crystal, animals made of bronze, music- and measuring instruments, automats and clocks. A very important part of the collection were portraits of wondrous persons like the hairy people, Vlad Dracula and others. =Armouries= Armor in Schloss Ambras Archduke Ferdinand II's idea of a museum was a novelty: he systematically collected armour from famous personalities of his time. He presented this armour \\"to the eternal memory\\" of that persons - mostly military commanders - in the \\"Heldenr√ºstkammer\\" (Heroes' Armoury); some on display today still in the original 16th century showcases. His \\"R√ºstkammern\\" (Armouries) contain very rare examples of arms and armour from the 15th century which originally came from the collections of Emperor Maximilian I and Archduke Sigismund. Armour for tournaments like the German joust or the German course, and the armour of the court's giant Bartlm√§ Bon, who took part in the tournament in Vienna in 1560, can be seen. The \\"Leibr√ºstkammer\\" (Court Armoury) includes the archduke's private armour and the armour of the court of Innsbruck. Ferdinand's collection of armour was one of the most important of its kind, not only because of the collection idea, but also because of the quality and quantity of his objects. Today, selected objects still illustrate the museum idea in Innsbruck at Ambras Castle, whereas many of the armour is exhibited at the Hofjagd- und R√ºstkammer (Imperial Armoury) of the Kusthistorisches Museum, Vienna. =Upper Castle= The Upper Castle, the oldest part of Ambras Castle, contains the Habsburg Portrait Gallery. About 300 portraits from the 15th to the 19th century, including King Albrecht II, Emperor Maximilian I, Charles V and Ferdinand I, to the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Franz II, a contemporary of Napoleon Bonaparte. Because of the various dynastic relations, the collection also shows members of other European dynasties. The portraits were painted by well-known artists such as Lucas Cranach the Elder, Antonis Mor, Titian, Anthony van Dyck and Diego Vel√°zquez. The Strasser Collection of Glass is amongst the most important of its kind in the world. Built up by Professor Rudolf Strasser over a period of more than fifty years this collection includes valuable Renaissance and Baroque Period lasses from Europe's most important glass producing regions, for example Venice, Bohemia, Hall, Innsbruck and Silesia. The high quality of the collection is quite comparable with the collection of these epochs in the Corning Museum of Glass. The Collection of Gothic Sculpture presents objects date from the time of Emperor Maximilian I (1459‚Äì1519). The main work is the imposing St George altar-piece which was made by Sebold Bocksdorfer commissioned by Maximilian and important for the Habsburg's Order of Saint George. The Inner Courtyard, decorated between 1564 and 1567 with grisaille painting al fresco (grey painting on still-wet plaster), is among the best- preserved examples of fresco from the sixteenth century. The representations of princely virtues and muses, female and male heroes, and diverse heroic acts sought to display the royalty as exemplary. They relate to their commissioner Archduke Ferdinand II, patron of the arts and host of lavish festivities. In cultural historical terms the Bathing Chambers of Philippine Welser, the only bath of the 16th century completely preserved, is something of a cultural heritage. The Chapel is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Consecrated for the first time in 1330 and often rebuilt over the centuries, it was finally painted in the 19th century by the Innsbruck painter August W√∂rndle. Ambras Castle silver coin Ambras Castle is so popular and well known, that it was the subject of one of the best known famous silver collectors' coins: the 10 euro Ambras Castle coin. On the obverse of the coin there is a general view of the castle to the south of Innsbruck with its Renaissance style gardens forms the central design. On the reverse, three court musicians cross the floor of the Spanish Hall, based on a picture from 1569. This design recalls the court festivals for which Fedinand II had the Spanish Hall specially constructed.

Crowther, , (December 16, 1910 - December 25, 2006) was an architect and author who achieved international renown for his progressive holistic compositions, particularly his pioneering designs employing passive solar energy.  Career  Crowther was born in Newark, New Jersey, and moved to San Diego, California at age 21. He worked for a neon sign manufacturer and later employed neon light as an architectural element and as ambient illumination. In 1948, Crowther moved to Denver, Colorado, where he built ticket booths and renovated the ballroom at Lakeside Amusement Park. He also began building energy-efficient homes in Denver. Crowther designed the spacious, sleek-lined Cooper theaters in Denver, St. Louis Park, Minnesota, and the Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska. All were the first theaters designed around the Cinerama film technology, with cushioned seats on curving risers. The original blueprints for the theater are in the Denver Public Library Western History and Genealogy Department. The first such theater, the Cooper Theater, in Denver, featured a 146-degree louvered screen (measuring a massive 105 feet by 35 feet), 814 seats, courtesy lounges on the sides of the theatre for relaxation during intermission (including smoking facilities), and a ceiling which routed air and heating through small vent slots in order to inhibit noise from the building's ventilation equipment. . The other two theatres were built in a similar format, however, the last theatre, the Indian Hills Theater had a slightly larger screen and other improvements. Each element of the theaters was designed to enhance the Cinerama experience. The circular design took advantage of the discovery that patrons, if left to their own devices, would seat themselves in an oval pattern. The exterior circular shape served as a constant reminder to passing motorists that this was a Cinerama theater. The design included a cylindrical shape and a flat roof. The base of the building exteriors consisted of black Roman brick. The upper portion of the exteriors were clad in insulated Monopanels which were a burnt- orange color called \\"Swedish red.\\" His pioneering work in residential solar technology led to lectures at the Smithsonian Institution, solar conferences and universities across the U.S. Crowther's architecture publications are still used to teach students. His \\"Sun-Earth\\" text has a reputation for setting a benchmark in holistic architecture design, with arguments outlining economic and environmental benefits. He practiced what he preached, both by living and working in holistically designed spaces, and by a diet replete with organic and natural foods. In 2006, Crowther was interviewed by filmmaker Jim Fields, for his documentary movie Preserve Me A Seat, about the grass-root failures and successes of activists working to preserve historic movie theaters in Boston, Chicago, Omaha and Salt Lake City.http://www.apartment101films.com The Cooper theaters and many of Crowther's other designs have been demolished. He particularly regretted seeing one of his energy-efficient homes expanded into a larger but inefficient showcase. Crowther was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 15, 2011 Geography It flows along the east face of the hills, east of Oakland and San Leandro. It runs into Upper San Leandro Reservoir and then Lake Chabot, both reservoirs are North of the unincorporated town of Castro Valley. It then flows through the city of San Leandro, and after crossing Hegenberger Road just north of Oakland International Airport on into San Leandro Bay of San Francisco Bay. Watershed Although it is channeled and culverted in places, it is remarkable among East Bay streams for being mostly uncovered throughout most of its course. It is joined by Indian Creek, and then at Upper San Leandro Reservoir it is joined by Moraga Creek, Redwood Creek, Buckhorn Creek and Kaiser Creek, then just below the spillway by Miller Creek. At Lake Chabot in Anthony Chabot Regional Park it is joined by Grass Valley Creek, then descends to San Leandro Bay. The Redwood Creek tributary is protected by Redwood Regional Park, which contains the largest remaining natural stand of coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) found in the East Bay. The creek terminates in Arrowhead Marsh, one of the few marshlands left in the East Bay. The marsh formed in San Leandro Bay between 1855 and 1895 from sediments washed down San Leandro Creek during construction of the Lake Chabot dam and also from the logging of the San Antonio Forest. History San Leandro Creek was formerly named Arroyo de San Leandro, likely named by the Spanish for St. Leander, 6th-century archbishop of Seville, \\"Apostle of the Goths\\". It was crossed by El Camino Viejo now, State Route 185. The creek is known for having been the site of the first rainbow trout hatchery in the world, drawing on the locally native variety of the species. The fish raised in this hatchery were sent as far away as New York.About Trout: The Best of Robert J. Behnke from Trout Magazine By Robert J. Behnke, Ted Williams Although rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), was initially identified in 1792 in Kamchatka, Siberia by Johann Julius Walbaum, William P. Gibbons, founder of the California Academy of Sciences, believed in 1855 that he had discovered a new species of trout in San Leandro Creek, which he named Salmo iridea (now the coastal rainbow trout subspecies Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus).Redwood Regional Park, East Bay Regional Parks District The site was then declared a California Historical Landmark. In 1874 work began on Lake Chabot Dam and it was completed in 1875, forming a lake. Lake Chabot serves as a standby emergency water supply but was opened to limited recreation in the 1960s. Four miles upstream, a second dam built in 1926 formed San Leandro Reservoir. Ecology It sustains the redwood groves in the unincorporated town of Canyon, California and was formerly lined with numerous oaks and willows in its lower course. Historical records indicate that Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) occurred in at least two San Francisco Bay Area watersheds, San Leandro Creek in Alameda County, and San Mateo Creek in San Mateo County. In the 1870s, ‚Äúquinnant‚Äù, or Chinook salmon were reported from lower San Leandro Creek and persisted in Lake Chabot for several years following the completion of Lake Chabot Dam in 1875. California Department of Fish and Game Warden George Smalley reported runs of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) in San Leandro Creek ‚Äú‚Ä¶in the early days‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶that after the completion of the Upper San Leandro Reservoir a run still persisted to the base of the dam for many years‚Äù. Leidy considered this single historical account of coho in the creek \\"reliable...since we believe that suitable habitat was present in the watershed.\\" As mentioned above, Gibbons discovered rainbow trout in San Leandro Creek in 1855. Thus, three species of Oncorhynchus once inhabited San Leandro Creek. Today, Lake Chabot's rainbow trout are hatchery fish, but the rainbow trout in San Leandro Reservoir are descended from native steelhead which were trapped when San Leandro Dam was constructed on Redwood Creek in 1926. The San Leandro trout have maintained genetic integrity with native coastal rainbow trout since they have not been mixed with hatchery trout, and were used in a 1983 reintroduction of steelhead to Wildcat Creek in Tilden Regional Park.

They are commonly called auger beetles, false powderpost beetles, or horned powderpost beetles. The head of most auger beetles cannot be seen from above, as it is downwardly directed and hidden by the thorax. Exceptions are the powderpost beetles (subfamily Lyctinae), and members of the subfamily Psoinae. Dinoderus brevis Bostrychoplites cornutus has large, distinctive thoracic horns, and is found in parts of Africa and Arabia; it is often imported to Europe as larvae in African wooden bowls (\\"ethnic souvenirs\\") .

Second Processors 6502 Second Processor The second processors are connected to Acorn's proprietary and trademarked Tube interface. Only one second processor could be connected at a time. The terminology of second processor was slightly misleading, since connected and switched on, the system worked on a \\"host-parasite\\" model, with the processor in the external unit taking control while the 6502 in the \\"main\\" computer simply took on responsibility for I/O. =6502 Second Processor= Interior of the 6502 Second Processor The 6502 Second Processor (using a 65C02) was clocked at 3 MHz, a full 50% faster than the 6502 inside a BBC Model B, and also had 64 KB of RAM, of which typically 30‚Äì44 KB was free for application data (compared to as little as 8¬Ω KB on an unexpanded Model B in graphics mode, or even less with the disc interface). A version of BBC BASIC II, called Hi-BASIC, was produced on ROM for this processor, and Hi versions of View, WordWise and Intersheet were also produced. Various CAD programs were able to take advantage of the 65C02 Second Processor, as was the second processor- specific version of Elite. =Z80 Second Processor= The Z80 Second Processor required the floppy disc upgrade: it was aimed at business and enabled the BBC system to run CP/M programs. It came with a suite of software that included the COBOL programming language. It ran at 6 MHz and had 64 KB of RAM. =32016 Second Processor= Originally referred to as the Gluon, a National Semiconductor 32016 second processor solution was apparently planned for the BBC Micro and for other 8-bit microcomputers, with the BBC Micro version employing the Tube interface and offering a quarter of a megabyte of RAM, whereas the \\"Universal Gluon\\" would be connected to a microcomputer acting as a terminal using a serial or parallel interface, offer up to 1 MB of RAM, up to 5 MB of hard disk storage, and either a minimal operating system or Unix. The product that was eventually delivered is a sophisticated second processor expansion sometimes branded as \\"Acorn Cambridge Co-Processor\\" with an Acorn logo, and sometimes as \\"BBC Microcomputer System 32016 Second Processor\\" along with the BBC Micro's owl logo. The device uses the 32016 CPU and 32081 FPU running at 6 MHz. It runs the non-graphical Panos operating system. Various programming languages are available including C, FORTRAN, Lisp, and Pascal, in addition to a version of BBC BASIC. Initially offered as the 32016 Second Processor with 256 KB of RAM, the expansion was subsequently delivered as the Cambridge Co-Processor with 512 KB or 1 MB of RAM as standard. The 32016 second processor is also present as part of the Acorn Cambridge Workstation using an 8 MHz CPU and 4 MB of RAM, sold as part of the Acorn Business Computer line. Originally, Acorn had apparently sought to use CPUs rated for 10 MHz, but seemed to have settled for available parts as the different products were introduced. The second processor board was also able to use 64-kilobit or 256-kilobit RAM devices, thus allowing the earlier 256 KB specification to be upgraded to 1 MB as the higher-density devices became available and affordable. =Universal Second Processor Unit= The Universal Second Processor Unit was an adapter for BBC Master internal co-processor boards, to allow them to be used as external co-processors. It comprised a power supply, interface logic and a connector that matched the internal co- processor connector built into the BBC Master main board. This allowed the BBC B and B+ to use the Turbo board (4 MHz 65C102 with 64 KB of RAM) and the Master 512 board (10 MHz 80186 with 512 kKB of RAM), by fitting them into this expansion unit. It also allowed the BBC Master to have two internal co- processor boards connected, only one of which could be enabled through software. =ARM Evaluation System= As one of the first production RISC processors, the ARM Evaluation System was part of the development programme leading to the Acorn Archimedes and its early Arthur operating system. It was not branded \\"BBC\\", but it is physically contained within the family's \\"cheese wedge\\" case. The ARM 1 processor was clocked at 8 MHz, and was fitted with 2 MB or 4 MB of RAM. In 2006, a new ARM processor board using an ARM7TDMI processor was designed and sold, without an enclosure but able to fit within the original case. Adapters The adapters connected to the BBC Micro's 1 MHz bus interface. Adapters could be daisy-chained, allowing more than one to be fitted. =Teletext adapter= The teletext-like \\"Mode 7\\" display mode inside the 8-bit BBC Micros made a broadcast teletext adapter an obvious expansion, and the BBC would broadcast telesoftware free over Ceefax. The hardware and software design was created by Graham Toal. The initial software to use the adapter was quite basic but the BBC decided to rewrite it and produced the Advanced Teletext System. This new ROM added several new features including support for the new Fastext system, which introduced the four coloured buttons subsequently found almost ubiquitously on European remote controls, including the \\"red button\\" which remains a feature of digital television broadcasting. The adapter itself was mains powered with its own power switch matching the one on the BBC microcomputer. Connection to the computer was via a ribbon cable and the only other connector on the adapter was a female 75ohm TV aerial (in) connector. The adapter contained four manual tuning wheels to receive signals from four different broadcast channels. Rear view of the adapter. Once tuned, use of the adapter, including switching channels, was controlled via the computer. Teletext pages were displayed on the computer monitor. =Prestel adapter= The Prestel adapter was essentially a modem fitted into the \\"cheese wedge\\"-shaped case. It enabled the user to connect to Prestel viewdata services over a telephone line. =IEEE 488 interface= Allowed the BBC Micro to talk over an IEEE-488 bus to specialised equipment. \\"Acorn\\" rather than \\"BBC\\" branded. Econet bridge Used to connect two Econet segments together. An Econet bridge is capable of automatically learning a simple network topology and selectively forwarding packets from one LAN segment to the other using a simple routing table based on the contents of the network byte in the Econet packet. The Econet bridge is unique among the cheese wedge expansions, in that it is a stand-alone device that does not require a BBC computer to operate.

It was built in 1961 to help with the overflow of students from Orillia District Collegiate & Vocational Institute. In March 2008, a review process was to have begun to consolidate Orillia's three public high schools into two buildings as a result of cost of maintenance of the aging buildings and the declining enrolment at PSCI. Park Street had a capacity of 1011 students but, as of 2006, fewer than 900 students were enrolled. On 28 November 2007, a bomb threat written on a mirror in a student washroom caused great concern and students were kept in classes in a school lockdown for the morning as police cleared the building room by room. Nothing suspicious was found and students returned to classes following an extended lunch break. Alt URL The school was closed and demolished in 2013, and a new school was planned to be built in its place to replace both Park Street Collegiate and Orillia District Collegiate & Vocational Institute. Special programs PSCI has a Construction Craft Program in Grade 11, partnership with the YMCA and CAPC for a Young Parent Education Support Program, Life Skills courses, Co-operative education program, and a private nursery school that links to parenting courses. Other programs include: a Latin program, full music, art and drama programs, electronics, transportation, construction, yearbook, manufacturing, drafting, model construction, and computer technology.

It was known as Mikhaylovka until 1920, Karmir Gyugh between 1920 and 1971, and Krasnoselsk between 1972 and 1991. Chambarak was founded in 1835-40 as Mikhaylovka on the Getik River by Russian immigrants . Karmir Gyugh and Krasnosyelsk both mean \\"Red Village\\" in Armenian and Russian respectively. As per the 2011 census, the population of the town was 5,853. Etymology The word Chambarak literally means small camp in Armenian. The names is derived from an older settlement that existed on the present town's place during the Middle Ages, as there are the remains of the 1th-century Surb Grigor Church and many khachkars (cross-stones) in the town dating back to the 13th century. History The remains of Surp Grigor Church in Chambarak, dating back to 1029 Originally, the village of Mikhaylovka was gradually formed between 1740 and 1785 by Russian Molokan migrants who moved from the areas of Samara and Saratov of the Russian Empire. The village occupied the place of the older Armenian settlement of Chambarak. With the sovietization of Armenia in 1920, Mikhaylovka was renamed Karmir Gyugh (Red Village). In December 1937, the Krasnoselsk Raion was formed as an administrative division of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, with the village of Karmir Gyugh as its centre. In 1971, Karmir Gyugh was enlarged with the merger of the nearby settlements of Verin (upper) and Nerkin (lower) Chambarak, and turned into an urban-type settlement. The following year, the settlement was officially renamed Krasnoselsk. After the independence of Armenia, Krasnoselsk was renamed Chambarak in 1992 and became an urban community (municipality). In July 2020, Chambarak became a site for the clashes with Azerbaijan. Economy The population of Chambarak is mainly involved in agriculture and cattle-breeding. It used to have small firms for cheese production.

He served as the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and Goa, as well as the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. He was also elected to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian Parliament) and served as the Union Minister for Urban Development and Tourism. Early Life Jagmohan Malhotra was born in a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family to Amir Chand and Dropadi Devi on 25 September 1927 in Hafizabad in Undivided India (now in Pakistan). He got married in 1957 to Uma, who came to be known as Uma Jagmohan. Career  Jagmohan first gained notoriety during his stint as vice-chairman of the Delhi Development Authority in the mid 1970s. During this time he grew close to Sanjay Gandhi, who began to wield increasing clout in the functioning of his mother Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government. During the Emergency (1975‚Äì77), Sanjay Gandhi entrusted Jagmohan with the \\"beautification\\" of Delhi, a task that involved large-scale demolition of slums. These beautification drives disproportionately affected Muslims, traditionally Congress-party voters, whose disenchantment contributed to Indira Gandhi's massive defeat in the 1977 general election.\\"Slum demolitions in Delhi since the 1990s: An Appraisal\\" by Veronique Dupont, EPW, 12 July 2008, pages 84‚Äì85. Despite this Jagmohan, already a Padma Shri since 1971, was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1977. In 1982, as Delhi hosted the Asian Games, Jagmohan served his second term as the city's Lieutenant Governor. The games were a success and he was credited for his capable administration of the city at the time. Later Delhi hosted the Non-Aligned Summit, which was also a success. Electoral History Jagmohan contested the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat in 1996 for the 11th Lok Sabha, where he defeated Bollywood star Rajesh Khanna by 58,000 votes. In 1998 and 1999, Jagmohan won the seat again defeating R K Dhawan of the Indian National Congress twice. In 2004, he lost to Ajay Maken of the Indian National Congress by 12,784 votes. = Governor of Jammu and Kashmir = During his tenure as Governor of Jammu and Kashmir (1984‚Äì89), militancy in the troubled state was at its peak. Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto in a series of speeches notoriously threatened to make him \\"Bhagmohan\\" (implying he would flee out of fear) and \\"Ham us ko jag jag mo mo han han bana denge\\" (implying he would be cut/torn to pieces by militants). In Jammu and Kashmir, Jagmohan is credited for bring order to one of the most revered shrines of Hindus, called Mata Vaishno Devi. He created a board that continues to provide administration for the shrine. Infrastructure was developed and that continues to facilitate pilgrims. However, allegations persist that he was involved in extra-legal crackdowns in Kashmir engineered by Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. In 1989, when militancy re-exploded in Kashmir, Jagmohan was as its Governor by Prime Minister V. P. Singh's government. Till then Jagmohan had enjoyed the confidence of Congress, including Indira Gandhi's other son Rajiv Gandhi. However, he fell out with them due to different views on Jammu and Kashmir, and joined their rivals the BJP. = In BJP = When the BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Prime Minister in 1998, Jagmohan served in his cabinet in a variety of portfolios, including communications, urban development and tourism. During the 1990s, Jagmohan had served as nominated MP in the Rajya Sabha in 1990‚Äì96, and won a hat-trick of Lok Sabha elections from New Delhi (1996, 1998 and 1999).  Awards and Honors  On the basis of his service record and recommendations made by top civil servants, he was honoured, on 26 January 1971, with the award of Padma Shri by the President of India, \\"for formulation and implementation of the Delhi Master Plan and for playing a pioneering role in planning and implementation of projects in Delhi\\". He was functioning as the Vice-Chairman of Delhi Development Authority With a meager revolving fund of just Rs. Five crore, Jagmohan launched large number of land acquisition and development schemes, showcasing how development effort could be financed by creating facilities ‚Äì thus increasing value of the state land resources. For a series of innovations of this genre, good management skills, and for \\"his meritorious services to the country\\" he was awarded Padma Bhushan in 1977. In 2016, Padma Vibhushan was awarded to him. As Implementation Commissioner, and later as Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority, Jagmohan executed, with his usual zeal, the various Parliament approved schemes of Clearance-cum-Resettlement-cum Redevelopment which the vested interests in politics labelled as demolition drives.

She was born in Falmouth, Maine. Mercy Lewis, formally known as Mercy Allen, was the child of Philip Lewis and Mary (Cass) Lewis. Early life Lewis was a refugee seeking out protection after an attack on her village. Her family later stayed in Casco Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Maine, New England, with other refugees. Rev. George Burroughs, a Puritan minister who served in Salem, Massachusetts from 1680‚Äì83, was one of the survivors of the attack by the Native Americans. After settling in Salem, Mercy Lewis's uncle, Thomas Skilling, died from an injury brought on by the attack. In 1683, the Lewis family traveled back to the island in Casco Bay. The second attack of the Native Americans in 1689 resulted in the death of Mercy's parents and made her an orphan. On September 30, 1689, an attack by Native Americans killed her grandparents, aunts, uncles and most of her cousins. As a result, the 14-year- old Mercy was placed as a servant in the household of Rev. Burroughs. By 1691, she had moved to Salem, where a married sister was living; she became a servant in Thomas Putnam's household. Salem Witch Trials Lewis played a crucial role during the Salem witch trials in 1692, when 20 people were executed for witchcraft, including her former master, George Burroughs. Like the accusation placed on Elizabeth Proctor on March 26, 1692, Mercy was accountable for hindering Mary Eastey's release from prosecution and eventual execution after all other charges against Eastey had been dropped. Accusations were made against Elizabeth Proctor that she tormented both Abigail Williams and Mercy Lewis in their homes. It is reported that Mercy Lewis was a victim of child abuse after statements were taken from witnesses such as Abigail Williams and Thomas Putnam. As a member of the Putnam household, Lewis became friends with Ann Putnam, Jr. and her cousin Mary Walcott. Putnam and Walcott's accusations would help launch the witch hysteria. In early April 1692, Lewis claimed that Satan had appeared to her, offering her \\"gold and many fine things\\" if she would write in his book; shortly thereafter, Satan appeared to her in the form of Burroughs, whom she reported \\"carried me up to an exceeding high mountain and showed me all the kingdoms of the earth, and told me that he would give them all to me if I would write in his book.\\" No information or medical history was recorded on the mental state of Mercy Lewis during the Salem Witch Trails. However, it was reported that Mercy suffered from episodes of seizures. One record stated that Lewis had a violent seizure on May 7, 1692, after experiencing torture and threats from Burroughs. This act was brought on by Lewis's refusal to print her name in a book Reverend Burroughs owned in order to clearly state her allegiance to him. Lewis also accused Mary Esty, sister of Rebecca Nurse, who would be tried and hanged. Others accused by Lewis include Giles Corey, Bridget Bishop, Susannah Martin, John Willard, and Sarah Wildes. Lewis was the subject of accusations. Ann Putnam Jr. claimed she had seen Lewis' apparition, though she said it had not harmed her. After the trials, Mercy moved to Boston to live with her aunt. There she bore an illegitimate son. By 1701, she had married a Mr. Allen in Boston. Fiction and Popular Culture Lewis is one of the featured characters in Arthur Miller's play (and later film) The Crucible. She is also a character in the 2014 TV series Salem, portrayed by Elise Eberle. Porpentina Goldstein used Mercy Lewis‚Äô name as an expression of surprise and shock in the movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. In the 2020 video game Death end re;Quest 2, there is a character named Mercy Lewis. Though she does not get accused of witchcraft in the game, her name could be a reference to the character in the play since the game has themes that are inspired by Christianity.

As the name suggests, the circuit is predominantly a hillside circuit, with steep, natural hills mixed with man-made supercross inspired table-top jumps, along with a spectacular 'wall of death' banked hairpin turn. Rhayader Midweek Motocross Series The circuit is well known in the UK amongst motocross fans for staging the annual Rhayader Midweek Motocross series, where some of Britain's top motocross riders, along with both local experts and beginners, compete in a 3-round series. The events are organised by the local Rhayader Motorcycle and Light Car Club and are staged across three Wednesday evenings during the long summer nights, (usually between late May and early July). The event was initially started in 1995, as a chance for local racers to have a midweek race, however since then the event has gained a large following. Despite the series not being an official motocross championship, over 4,000 fans regularly turn up at events. The organizers are known to keep admission prices to a minimum, and despite there only being a few hours of racing, fans enjoy an action-packed race schedule with no down time between races, and the hilly nature of the circuit means that spectators can view the entire circuit from a single vantage point. The theme of the races has remained the same since 1995.

Her first appearance occurred in the weekly series 52. Publication history Lady Styx first appeared in 52 #31 as the main antagonist to Adam Strange, Animal Man, and Starfire. She later made appearances in Omega Men and Countdown to Adventure. Though not present herself, Lady Styx's cult appeared in Rann/Thanagar: Holy War. Keith Giffen, breakdown artist for 52, commented that Lady Styx was created to be a villain similar to Darkseid, who they felt was being overused.Commentary by Keith Giffen in 52: Volume Three trade paperback, p. 117. Fictional character biography Lady Styx's origins are at this time unknown, though the Guardians of the Universe (clearly distressed by her presence) believe she originates from somewhere outside the known cosmos. Worshipped as a goddess by her followers, the Lady sends forth her legions to ravage planets and transform their populations into her undead slaves. This is known as the \\"Stygian Passover\\". In her twisted mind, this is a way of bringing order to a chaotic universe, uniting all peoples as one race with a single purpose, the worship of her. Lady Styx's missionaries are known as Darkstars, a name taken from a former intergalactic peacekeeping force. Transformed into zombies and robbed of their individual identity, these brainwashed beings preach the glory of the Lady, urging their enemies to \\"believe in her\\". In 52, it is implied that Lady Styx put a bounty on the heads of Starfire, Adam Strange, and Animal Man,52 Week 35 (January 3, 2007) DC heroes who had been stranded in space following the events of Infinite Crisis. Seeing the destruction wrought by her followers and fearing their homeworlds could be next, the trio of space heroes decide to make a stand against her. They are begrudgingly aided by the former intergalactic bounty hunter Lobo, who takes them to the Lady on the pretense of collecting on their bounty. The resulting battle leads to the apparent death of Animal Man via a necrotoxin (though he was later resurrected by the very aliens who originally gave him his powers). Lady Styx is apparently killed in Week 36 of 52, absorbed by a Sun-Eater while battling the Green Lantern Ekron (a.k.a. the \\"Emerald Head\\").52 Week 36 (January 10, 2007) Some time later, she's able to grow new flesh for herself from a pregnant captive. =One Year Later= Following the one-year gap during which 52 takes place, she has reappeared in several of DC Comics' science fiction series. In Mystery in Space, she is the source of Captain Comet's death and rebirth, a cycle which began when her forces attacked him in 52. In the 2006 Omega Men miniseries, Lady Styx appears as the central antagonist, seeking powerful artifacts known as \\"heartstones\\" in her attempt to remake the universe and usurp the role of God. Apparently trapped in another dimension, Lady Styx manifests in this series as a giantess. Once again, she tries growing new flesh from the bodies of her followers. Using the stones as a focus, she recreates a new, giant body, combining and reshaping her supplicants' bodies. She is stopped in her plan by the Omega Men and finally killed by a resurrected and empowered Felicity (wife of the Omega Men's commander-in-chief Tigorr), now re-christened Nimbus. However, Lady Styx was apparently able to hold her consciousness together in Felicity's subconscious. There, the Lady waits to strike again. In Countdown to Adventure, it appears that the Lady has been able to infect both the planets Earth and Rann. On Earth, there have been random outbursts of people acting homicidal and psychopathic, and on Rann, the public has become supportive of their new hero, an Earthman named Champ Hazard, and his destructive and violent ways.

Svend Svendsen was an unsuccessful pursuer to the throne, who died when he was at a point of being elected as king. Henry Skadelaar was crippled and not considered a candidate for kingship. Instead he was a frequent schemer and plotter, generating a number of enemies. Three sons of Henry and Ingrid are recorded, including King Magnus II of Sweden. Ingrid is known to have intrigued for Magnus to obtain the Swedish throne, in Ingrid's opinion her late father's rightful inheritance. She reportedly suggested that her son Magnus employ the man who would kill Sverker I of Sweden.source: Lagerqvist Henry Skadelaar died on 4 June 1134 at the Battle of Fotevik in the Bay of Fotevik near Vellinge in Sk√•ne. Ingrid soon after married King Harald Gille of Norway. By him, Ingrid had a son who later became King Inge Haraldsson of Norway. When King Harald was murdered in 1136, Ingrid played a prominent part in having her son, Inge, and her stepson, Sigurd, proclaimed co-rulers, and in waging the ensuing war against the attempted usurper, Sigurd Slembe. She remained one of the most important advisors of King Inge throughout his reign.Gilchrist Harald 4 Gille (Store norske leksikon) Her third husband was Ottar Birting (√ìttarr Birtingr), a prominent lendmann, but she was again widowed when he was killed in Nidaros at some point in the 1140s.

Ingrid's fourth and last husband was Arne Ivarsson of St√•rheim, (√Årni √çvarsson √° Sto√∞reimi), another prominent lendmann with whom she had four children. Arne Ivarsson was subsequently called Kongsm√•g meaning in-law of the king. As an advisor to her son King Inge, Ingrid played a prominent part in many of the events of the early civil war era in Norway. On 3 February 1161, King Inge was defeated and killed, leading his men into battle against King Haakon the Broadshouldered. In the saga Heimskringla, Ingrid is last mentioned when she and her husband left Norway for exile in Denmark. =Notes on name= Ingrid's name can be found in a wide variety of spellings in the modern Scandinavian languages and English.

The mission base was founded on the banks of the Qua Iboe River, and this base gave the name to the independent interdenominational mission that Bill founded. Bill was a contemporary of Mary Slessor. Although not as well known as his Scottish counterpart, Bill's legacy is twofold. First, many historians of the Irish evangelical missionary movement note that he was one of the most influential men of his time, inspiring many in Ireland to overseas Christian service. The Qua Iboe Mission grew to be one of the largest and most successful missions in the UK. Secondly, the church that he founded, the Qua Iboe Church has grown to considerable proportions, numbering at least 2 million strong in 2007, and his memory is still strongly revered by many Nigerian Christians today. A theological college at Abak in southern Nigeria is named in his honour.

His story and the story of FGBMFI is the subject of the book The Happiest People on Earth, written by John and Elizabeth Sherrill (Guideposts Magazine) and published in 1975. Early life Demos was named after his Armenian grandfather, who, with most of his relatives were exiled in the late 1800s from Erivan Governorate (Armenia) to Karakala (Merkezkarakale) village, Kars Oblast, Russia, for their heretic folk-protestant religious views. In Kars they met and joined like-minded Spiritual Christian Pryguny, denominations of various volunteer settlers and religious exiles from Russia. Among the Pryguny in Romanovo village was a \\"Boy Prophet\\", Efim Gerasimovitch Klubnikin, who, as early as 1855, when he also lived in Erivan Governorate, began to have visions of an unspeakable tragedy and warned that all must flee to a \\"place of refuge.\\"Sherrill, John and Elisabeth, The Happiest People on Earth, Fleming H. Revell Company, 1975, p. 19. In 1895, neighboring Spiritual Christian Dukhobortsy in Transcaucasia staged a mass protest against the military, burned their guns, about 400 were jailed in Kars and Tiflis, half exiled, and about 2,000 died. The main road from Kars to Tiflis passed through Romanovo, where Klubnikin now lived and witnessed the passing of hundreds of escorted Spiritual Christian prisoners. The famous writer Leo N. Tolstoy protested to the Tsar about this cruelty, resulting in aid from the Society of Friends, London, and the Canadian government to move over 7,400 (about one-third) of all Dukhobortsy to central Canada. Immediately other Spiritual Christian tribes in Kars and Erevan petitioned to follow the Dukhobortsy to Canada. A Russian businessman in Los Angeles, Peter A. Demens had been promoting California to immigrants from Russia for a decade, objected to Dukhobortsy settling in Canada, and personally diverted most all non-Dukhobor Spiritual Christians arriving after 1901 away from Canada to Los Angeles, while the Freedomites began protesting against the Canadian government. As large groups of Pryguny, including the Shakarians and Klubnikins, began arriving in Los Angeles in 1905, most settled within a mile of the Azusa Street Revival as it was starting, and were delighted to meet spiritual faiths in America similar to theirs. Demos Sr. died while working on the construction of the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad in Nevada, and his young son Isaac became the head of the family. Isaac married Zarouhi Yessayian, and he became a prosperous dairy farmer in Downey, California. Demos Jr. entered the family business and their milk herd grew to become the largest in the world at the time. He married Rose Gabrielian in 1933. Evangelistic campaigns Shakarian used his organizational abilities to facilitate evangelistic campaigns, in particularly working with Charles S. Price. Other evangelists at his events included Tommy Hicks and William Branham and Oral Roberts. Shakarian spent most of his adult life building the Fellowship for free. Even honorariums that were given to him at speaking engagements he would deposit them back into the ministry. Every year at the annual board meeting he would resign his position as president, step out into the hall, and allow the 200 man board to vote on the next president. The Fellowship grew into over 190 countries. Hundreds of other ministries were birthed from the Fellowship. Shakarian played a key role in working with Paul Crouch to help launch Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). Joel Osteen‚Äôs ministry started from his father John Osteen. Shakarian played a key role in saving that ministry in the early days. When John was removed as a pastor due to his beliefs in the Pentecostal movement, Shakarian immediately caught a flight to be with John, convinced him not to quit but to start his own ministry wherein Shakarian funded the launching of John's first tent meeting. The Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International Shakarian noted that his tent campaigns mainly attracted women, and Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International was established to encourage more participation by men by providing a platform for businessmen to give religious testimonies. The plan was supported by Oral Roberts, and under his leadership, the FGBMFI had chapters in over 190 countries. Richard Shakarian is now international president of FGBMFI. Beliefs Shakarian was a third-generation Pentecostal, and he believed in the \\"Full Gospel\\", that all the supernatural events in the New Testament should be understood literally, and could also occur today. In particular, he believed that God healed the sick and injured (including on one occasion his own cattle herd from tuberculosis), and that Christians filled with the Holy Spirit received visions and promptings from God, including direct messages. Shakarian considered that although God sometimes prompted him to pray for healings, he was primarily to be a \\"helper\\", as defined by I Corinthians 12:28. He also believed that the rise of the Charismatic Movement was a harbinger of the Second Coming, and that there would be a persecution of Christians in America just before this occurred.

When founded in 1887, by the Irish independent missionary Samuel Bill, the organisation ministered in Nigeria. Today, it primarily works in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Chad and Kenya while maintaining headquarters in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Its current Chief Executive is the Reverend Dr Paul Bailie.  History  The roots of Mission Africa stretch back to the mid-1880s, when a group of chiefs from the Ibeno region of the Niger Delta approached the Calabar Mission of the Free Church of Scotland and asked for a missionary to work among them. The over-extended mission, unable to comply, passed on the request to Henry Grattan Guinness at his Harley Missionary Training College in London, where he circulated it. One of the college's trainees, Samuel Bill (1864‚Äì1942) from Belfast, responded energetically. In 1887, he set sail, without financial backing. The Calabar Mission could not afford him, and he started work alone at the mouth of the Qua Iboe River in December 1887, designing and constructing for himself a house, and the church at Upenekang. Bill's lifelong friend, Archibald Bailie commenced initial efforts at establishing a support base in Belfast for the new mission, but soon left Belfast to join Bill in Nigeria. The Qua Iboe Mission Council was formed in 1891 by representatives of the leading Belfast churches, of various denominations, to support Samuel Bill's work. Missionaries were drawn from Presbyterian, Baptist, Quaker and other backgrounds. The Mission Council continues its oversight of the Mission up to the present day. The Qua Iboe Church (now the QIC-United Evangelical Church of Nigeria) had by 2000 founded three colleges of theology, including the Samuel Bill Theological College at Ikot Ekang, Abak (started in the 1940s), three post-primary teaching institutions including Etinan Institute (started 1915), two hospitals (at Ekpene Obom and Ochadamu, the latter known as Holley Memorial Hospital) and a printing press at Etinan, as well as numerous primary schools. Membership of the Church was at first confined to rural areas, only slowly penetrating the towns and cities. By the year 2000, the denomination had grown to over 1,000 congregations throughout Nigeria which vary in size from around 50 people to over 1,000. The Mission changed its name from Qua Iboe Mission to Qua Iboe Fellowship in 1986, and then became known as Mission Africa in mid-2002. The change of name was intended to convey the broader scope of the Mission, since it is no longer confined to one area of Nigeria. The official legal name of the mission is now Mission Africa (The Qua Iboe Fellowship). It is a registered company in Belfast (R611) and recognised by the British tax authorities (HMRC) as a charity, XN45493.  Administration  Mission Africa is governed by a Home Council, drawn from the Christian Community in Northern Ireland. Everyday running of the mission is entrusted to the Chief Executive. Mission Africa is a member of Global Connections, the UK wide missions alliance, and Northern Ireland's mission facilitation organisation, Mission Agencies Partnership.  Mission Africa Today  The organisation's missionary efforts today are focused on theological education, cross-cultural training, church planting, medical work, responding to HIV/Aids, literature evangelism, and youth ministry. Its work, in various spheres of mission, includes: * Chad: working alongside the Evangelical Church of Chad (EET) and like minded mission agencies, most notably TEAM. * Burkina Faso: A concentration on church planting and rural development. Partners in Burkina are Evangelical Protestant Church. (EPE). WEC International worked in Burkina Faso for many years and Mission Africa were pleased to partner with them. * Nigeria: Mission Africa is primarily partnered with the QIC-United Evangelical Church,formerly the Qua Iboe Church, and supplies theological lecturers to the denomination's colleges. The Mission also supplies some support staff to the UEC hospitals. * Kenya : since 2011, Mission Africa has been partnered with the Presbyterian Church of East Africa. As of 2015 the partnership has been limited to Mission Africa sending small teams to Kenya. * Mission Africa also supply staff to the interdenominational Theological College of Northern Nigeria (TCNN) and the Jos ECWA Theological Seminary (JETS) which is the main seminary of the Evangelical Church of West Africa. * In 2006 Mission Africa and UEC commenced the STILLWATERS project, renamed in 2012 as ADVANCE, which intends to establish 1500 HIV/Aids care and counselling centres throughout Nigeria. Mision Africa has also been involved in HIV/Aids alleviation work through ECWA Evangel Hospital and The Faith Alive Foundation, both of which distribute antiretroviral drugs as part of the PEPFAR programme. ADVANCE is also engaged in various forms of compassionate ministry, such as rescuing orphaned and vulnerable children; this work primarily takes place in Kogi State. * Africa Christian Textbooks, the literature distribution service that Mission Africa largely founded, supplies Christian academic books to students and pastors in Nigeria and Kenya. ACTS hopes to increasingly produce books by Africans for Africans, and also to translate many books for the Christian communities in the Francophone countries.

During the same time that the South Armagh Republican Action Force was active the INLA carried out at least one sectarian attack that killed Protestant civilians using the covername \\"Armagh People's Republican Army\\".

The IRA agreed to halt attacks on British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches.Extracts from The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA by Kevin J. Kelley. Zed Books Ltd, 1988. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals wanted no part of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when‚Äîthey claimed‚Äîthey had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA. There was a rise in sectarian killings during the truce, which 'officially' lasted until early 1976.

They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus hasten an end to the truce.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 Under orders not to engage the security forces, some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused serious problems of internal discipline and some IRA members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for-tat killings. INLA members, and current or former members of the Official IRA, were also allegedly involved. Tullyvallen attack Tullyvallen Orange Hall in 2009 On 1 September 1975, a few days after two Catholic civilians were shot dead a short distance way in Altnamackan, the South Armagh Republican Action Force claimed responsibility for a gun attack on Tullyvallen Orange Hall near Newtownhamilton, County Armagh. The attack happened at about 10pm, when a group of Orangemen were holding a meeting inside.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. Mainstream Publishing, 1999. p.572 A number of the Orangemen were members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and British Army and were armed. Two gunmen entered the hall and sprayed it with bullets while another stood outside and shot through a window. One of the Orangemen was an off-duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. He returned fire with a pistol and believed he hit one of the attackers.McKay, Susan. Northern Protestants: An unsettled people.

The park is known for its endemic flora and fauna, water falls and crater lakes. It is north of the capital, Antananarivo and is one of the most biologically diverse places in all of Madagascar with seventy-five species of birds, twenty-five species of mammals, and fifty-nine species of reptiles known to inhabit the park. Waterfall in Amber Mountain National Park Geography The park covers an area of on an isolated volcanic massif, of mostly basaltic rock, above the surrounding dry region. Attractions include spectacular waterfalls and several crater lakes. There are numerous rivers and streams and the park is a water catchment area for the town of Antsiranana, which is surrounded by dry, sparse forests and semi-desert with succulent plants. Annual rainfall in the park is compared with around the town. The area is named after the deposits of copal, a soft form of amber. Amber is one of the most accessible parks in northern Madagascar. Bush taxis travel to Joffreville daily from Antsiranana, taking about 45 minutes. On the trip up the mountain to the entrance of the park there are a few small villages and there is a lodge for guests at Joffreville. Living in and around the park are the Sakavala and Antankarana peoples. Flora and fauna Most of the park is covered montane rainforest with trees up to tall and covered in lianas, orchids and ferns such as bird's-nest fern (Asplenium nidus). The forest is isolated from other rainforests by the surrounding dry region. There are plantations of Eucalyptus and exotic conifers, pines, Araucaria and an invasive alien bush, Lantana camara. Over one thousand species of plants are recorded. Of the twenty-five species of mammals in the park, endemics include eight species of lemur, the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana). Thirty-five of the seventy-five species of birds are endemic including the Amber Mountain rock thrush (Monticola sharpei erythronotus) which is only known from one area on the Amber Mountain massif. The park is also known for its amphibians and reptiles such as the Amber Mountain leaf chameleon (Brookesia tuberculata), which is one of the smallest reptiles in the world. There are thirty-five species of frog.

It was the successor to the TVR Griffith 200, featuring improved cooling via a larger radiator with twin electric fans, redesigned rear suspension, and a redesigned rear with better visibility and the round taillights sourced from the Ford Cortina Mark I. The standard engine in the 400 was the more powerful Ford 289 'HiPo' Windsor engine producing 271 hp that was available in the Series 200 as an option. The 400 weighed a few more pounds than the 200 due mostly to the new Salisbury independent differential with a higher gear ratio giving it a higher top speed. Grantura Ltd of England designed the independent suspension for the TVR automobiles which later became the Griffith 200 and 400. The Griffith 400 had then state-of-the-art unequal wishbone suspension on all four corners and the car weighed significantly less than its contemporary, the AC Cobra, making it a very potent racing car. As the Series 400 cars were being produced in early 1965, the entire east coast of the US was crippled by a prolonged dock strike. This not only caused a disruption in the supply of the series 400 bodies that were being shipped from TVR in Blackpool, UK, it also caused a delay in the shipment of the newer body design of the Series 600. Frank Reisner, whose Intermeccanica body works in Turin, Italy, was building the new steel bodied Griffith, was also unable to have the bodies shipped. Jack Griffith attempted to bring his car to the public by having these bodies airlifted across the Atlantic. With only 59 copies of the 400 and 10 600s off the assembly line at the Griffith factory in Plainview, Long Island, N.Y, USA, the company was dissolved.

As a result of this step which was not agreed upon with Moscow (out of fears of it getting refused) Azerbaijani acquired increasingly an important status in the entire country. This was the main reason behind his premature removal from power.

Wills Radio Celebrities cigarette card series  Early life and career  He was born and raised in Clinton, Massachusetts, United States, one of three children of Peter and Mary Gibbons. In his late teens he travelled to London to study at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1924. he returned to London as a relief pianist with the Boston Orchestra for an engagement at the Savoy Hotel in the Strand. He liked Britain so much that he settled there. and later became the co-leader (with Howie Jacobs) of the Savoy Orpheans and the bandleader of the New MayFair Orchestra, which recorded for the Gramophone Company on the HMV label. In 1929, Gibbons appeared in the British film Splinters as \\"Carroll Gibbons and His Masters Voice Orchestra\\". Ray Noble led the New Mayfair [sic] Orchestra starting in 1929.  The 1930s  Gibbons made occasional return trips to the United States but settled permanently in England, though he did spend a couple of years (1930‚Äì1931) in Hollywood, where he worked as a staff composer for MGM films. He took exclusive leadership of the Savoy Hotel Orpheans, which recorded hundreds of popular songs (many of which were sung by Anne Lenner) between June 1932 and his death in 1954, all featuring Gibbons on piano. Starting in about 1931, he also recorded many sophisticated records featuring a piano-led small group playing pop tunes and medleys under the name of Carroll Gibbons and his Boy Friends, of which some contained tracks by singer Hildegarde. As a composer, Gibbons's most popular songs included \\"A Garden in the Rain\\" (1928) and \\"On The Air\\" (1932). The latter was covered by Rudy Vall√©e in 1933 and by Lud Gluskin in 1936. Gibbons' instrumental numbers \\"Bubbling Over\\" and \\"Moonbeam Dance\\" were also quite successful in the United Kingdom.

Middle Bay Beach () is located there. It is a gazetted beach with lifeguards provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in the daytime during the summer months. History The coastline was formerly lined with bathing sheds built by a variety of swimming associations and other groups. The Hong Kong University Alumni Association inaugurated a swimming pavilion at Middle Bay in 1957. In 1962, there were 49 such huts at Middle Bay. These were leased to the public on a yearly basis through balloting. In the late 1960s, the Urban Council moved to gradually replace bathing sheds with public changing rooms. Some sheds were pulled down in 1969 at Middle Bay and South Bay. A new beach building was completed by the Urban Council in July 1975. The rest of the bathing huts were demolished later. There was a serious hit-and-run case at the beach at about 4:30 pm on Sunday, 10 July 1983. A red speedboat entered the restricted swimming zone and ran down three young swimmers. The boat did not stop, and sped off in the direction of Deep Water Bay before police arrived. The crime went unsolved. One of the injured swimmers, 24-year-old Alun Chan Hon-wah, had to have his foot and part of his lower leg amputated. The police classified the case as \\"endangering life at sea\\", and the marine police and Marine Department increased patrols around beaches in an effort to protect swimmers' safety.

At the , Adventure Bay and the surrounding area had a population of 152.  Early history  The first European to sight the bay was explorer Abel Tasman, who sought to anchor his vessel Heemskerck there in 1642. Instead, Heemskerck was driven back offshore by a storm, in token of which Tasman named the place Storm Bay. Captain Tobias Furneaux renamed it in March 1773, in honour of his ship , which he had anchored in the bay for five days after becoming separated from Captain James Cook's during Cook's second voyage to the Pacific search of Terra Australis Incognita. Furneaux's log made clear the bay was an excellent anchorage for resupplying vessels: > To the SW of the first watering place there is a large lagoon which I > believe has plenty of fish in it for one of our Gentlemen caught upwards of > 2 dozen trout, and shot a possum which was the only animal we saw. There are > a great many gum trees and of a vast thickness and height, one of which > measured in circumference 26 feet and the height under the branches was 20 > feet.\\" Others among Furneaux's crew spotted evidence of what they believed were small deer but were more likely kangaroos. Furneaux also noted signs of an Aboriginal settlement in the form of \\"several huts or wigwams on shore, with several bags of grass in which they carry their shellfish.\\" \\\\- but the branches of which the huts were made were \\"split and torn\\" and there was \\"not the least appearance of any people.\\" Reliably mapped and offering an abundance of fresh water and game, Adventure Bay quickly became a popular anchorage for European explorers. Cook's Resolution watered there in 1777, followed by William Bligh aboard in 1788 and in 1792. Others who resupplied their vessels in the bay in this period included Bruni d'Entrecasteaux aboard Recherche in 1792 and 1793, and Nicolas Baudin in the corvette G√©ographe in 1802. Matthew Flinders also tried to enter the bay with Norfolk in 1798. That same year Adventure Bay became the site of whaling & timber stations.  European Settlement  British whalers were reported in Adventure Bay by 1804. Shore- based whaling stations operated in the bay from 1826 at four separate locations. During the 19th and 20th century Adventure Bay was used by the timber industry. Sheltered from all but strong north-easterly winds, the township of Adventure Bay at the southern end of the bay itself was the site of both extensive timber mills and a long jetty from where seagoing vessels could load timber. Dangerously exposed to north-easterly gales, several ships were driven ashore and wrecked there, the largest being the 241-ton barque Natal Queen in 1909. Adventure Bay Post Office opened on 1 December 1890 and closed in 1974. Adventure Bay is now largely a tourist destination. Facilities in town include a general store that sells petrol and a cafe. It is also the location for cruises around the island. Notes =Footnotes= Tasman's name, Storm Bay, survives in describing the larger inlet to the north and northeast of Adventure Bay, containing the mouth of the Derwent River estuary. =References=  Further reading  * Category:Towns in Tasmania Category:Whaling in Australia Category:Southern Tasmania Category:Bruny Island Category:Whaling stations in Australia ","title":"Adventure Bay, Tasmania"},{"id":"8881721","text":"Rawsonville is a small wine growing and farming community in the Breede River Valley of the Western Cape province of South Africa. The town forms part of the Breede Valley Local Municipality, and is located in a scenic portion of the valley on the eastern flanks of the Du Toitskloof Mountains. The town is part of the Breedekloof Wine Route and hosts the annual Breedekloof extreme sports festival. The economy remains heavily reliant on serving the agricultural community, however tourism in the form of weekend retreats are becoming more important to the town's income. Rawsonville is to the east of Cape Town and to the west of the large town of Worcester. Early history =Old Goudini Farms= Slanghoek, Klipdrift, Groot Vlakte, Groot Eiland, Gevonden, Goudyn, Boontjiesrivier, Dasbosch Rivier, Pokkekraal and Aan-de- Smalblaar were some of the original farms occupied by European settlers since 1709. =Town= By the 1850s the necessity for the formation of a hamlet had become clear; the ward was cut off from Worcester during the rainy season when the Breede River burst it banks regularly. The farm Aan-de-Smalblaar was transported to Johannes Petrus (Jan) Jordaan on 23 July 1858. Jan Jordaan divided a portion of the farm into 57 residential plots and these were sold at a public auction on 11 June 1859. The town was named for William Rawson, the Cape Colonial Secretary. Since the modern day, there is a rural suburban area called De Nova and squatter camps called 'Spookytown' and Geelkampies. =School= 45 Deelhebbers (participants) decided to form De Goudini School in 1858 and they were represented by seven school directors. Rawsonville also consist of schools called Rawsonville Primary, Weltevrede Primary and many more. =Church= On 16 June 1878 a public meeting was held to ascertain if a Dutch Reformed Church Congregation should be established at Rawsonville and on 14 October 1879 the Worcester Ring Commission granted permission for the formation of the Goudini Dutch Reformed Congregation. =Town Management= Under the Village Management Act Rawsonville was granted Town Management in 1883. During the 1800s, if a doctor was needed someone had to travel to Worcester on horseback or on foot and if it rained continuously for six hours, the Smalblaar River burst its banks and the water ran through town. Under these circumstances no school was attended. Climate The climate is hinterland (further from oceanic influences) mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its more inland location, winters can sometimes get frosty, with heavy snowfalls sometimes falling on the surrounding high ground. Summers are generally mild, although some February and March days can reach or higher. Vineyards Located within the wine district of Breedekloof, Rawsonville is part of the Breedekloof wine route, a scenic byway that passes 22 wineries of differing sizes. A new community centre with facilities including a meeting hall and classrooms was opened in the town in 2018 for the Merwida wine estate. It is used by over 450 people, most of whom are vineyard workers.

He left school at the age of thirteen and started his working life as a grocer boy. Later, he joined his father at James Flood Motor Body Builders and worked as a blacksmith. In 1940, he enrolled at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology studying three nights a week and Saturday morning. By 1943 he had commenced evening classes at the National Gallery School which he continued until 1950. Looking for more rigorous tuition, he joined the George Bell School, where he studied intermittently from 1945 to 1949. Bell was a strong disciplinarian. Armstrong acknowledges that Bell taught him \\"everything that was worth anything\\". To escape the rigorous discipline of Bell and the more conservative teachings of the Gallery school, Armstrong and fellow students [Fred Williams] and Harry Rosengrave purchased a block of land at Lilydale. The \\"Block\\" was a place away from the constraints of the city, where almost every weekend for the next five years was spent painting in the open air. Paintings from this period were exhibited at the Stanley Cove Gallery in 1951. In education In 1951, Armstrong won the Commonwealth Jubilee Travelling Scholarship to the Slade School in London. During his time at the Slade an introduction to printmaking led to classes in etching and lithography - media he has excelled in ever since. On the return journey to Australia he met Kath. They married in Melbourne in 1954. In 1960 Armstrong was appointed Drawing Master at the National Gallery School, teaching alongside John Brack and Marc Clarke. Many of his Gallery students have developed notable careers of their own. In 1966 Armstrong resigned from the National Gallery School commencing a full-time painting career which he continued for the rest of his life, supplemented with intermittent teaching at the C.A.E and private classes at his home studio in Blackburn.

In 1965 the Australia Galleries in Collingwood exhibited Twelve Portraits by Ian Armstrong, which included the striking full-length portrait, David Lawrence 1965, acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria and Helen Brack 1965, acquired by State Library of Victoria. \\"In each of these paintings Armstrong relies not only on the face to describe character, but also the entire pose.\\" In the early 1970s, after suffering ill health and needing a change, Armstrong and his family moved to Wedderburn in central Victoria for a year, to paint the landscape and recover his health. His landscapes and portraits from this time have been exhibited widely and are represented in many regional galleries and private collections. In 1974 a grant awarded by the Visual Arts Board, Australia Council, led to a series of large portraits of family and friends. A trip to France and Spain in 1977 produced many prints and drawings. At a show in Adelaide, Ian met former Gallery School student Mark Pearce. Their rekindled friendship led to a series of joint projects, including decorating pots, exploring sculpture and many painting trips including time in the Flinders Ranges. During this time Armstrong developed a great love of the South Australian landscape. The 1980s involved building a mud brick house near Maryborough, central Victorian landscape painting, and more overseas travel. A trip to England and France on an Australia Council grant in 1988 led to three months study and work in Paris, based at the Cite International des Arts. In 1990, Armstrong sold the family home in Blackburn, and he and Kath moved to Anglesea. The next ten years were spent painting the local land and seascapes, with trips further afield to Mark Pearce‚Äôs Bungala, South Australia studio. Landscape painting En plein air was a passion that Armstrong followed for over 60 overs; during the 1990s he joined Rick Amor and others to form the 500 Friday Group. In 1999 he completed a painting trip to Central Australia with John and Renee Dent.

Williams became the first unseeded player to win the tournament since Christine O'Neil in 1978. Am√©lie Mauresmo was the defending champion, but was defeated by unseeded Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√° in the fourth round. This tournament was the final Australian Open singles appearance for three- time winner Martina Hingis, who lost in the quarterfinals against Kim Clijsters. Seeds  Qualifying  Daily review =Day 1: 15 January= The First day of play at Melbourne Park saw defending champion Am√©lie Mauresmo advance in straight sets to the second round, along with a string of Russian top-10 players (Kuznetsova, Petrova, Dementieva, among others). US Open semifinalist and Auckland champion Jelena Jankoviƒá also sailed through in straight sets, but rising teen Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° had to survive a tough three set challenge from Jill Craybas to advance. 2005 and 2003 champion Serena Williams showed glimpses of the form that saw her rise to World No.1 when she swept past 27th seed Mara Santangelo 6‚Äì2 6‚Äì1 despite a relatively poor service percentage of 45%. =Day 2: 16 January= The second day was ravaged by heat in excess of 40 deg Celsius (104 deg Fahrenheit) causing the Extreme Heat Policy to be implemented. Many matches were delayed due and play continued merely on the two roofed courts. Maria Sharapova was playing in Rod Laver Arena, but before the Extreme Heat Policy came in use. As a result, the roof could not yet be closed and the match had to be played in full heat. She was particularly distressed during the match squandering a 1‚Äì0 lead in sets and a 5‚Äì0 lead in the decisive set, but eventually defeated Camille Pin 6‚Äì3, 4‚Äì6, 9‚Äì7, who was two points away from victory serving for the match at 7‚Äì6. Fourth seed Kim Clijsters, on the other hand, advanced soundly in twelve straight games 6‚Äì0 6‚Äì0, defeating Hobart finalist Vasilisa Bardina. Three time winner and six time finalist Martina Hingis also swept through with little difficulty, losing only two games to 2005 semifinalist Nathalie Dechy. Ana Ivanovic lost as many games to Vania King to advance to the second Round. The only seeds to fall were Eleni Daniilidou of Greece who fell 4‚Äì6 0‚Äì6 to Aiko Nakamura, and Flavia Pennetta, who lost to 2006 Hasselt finalist Kaia Kanepi of Estonia in straight sets. Former World No. 8, Australian wildcard Alicia Molik also advanced. 12 first round matches, including those of Patty Schnyder and Dinara Safina were postponed until Wednesday. Seeded Players Out: Flavia Pennetta, Eleni Daniilidou =Day 3: 17 January= The third day's rain delays did not affect the woman's draw. Minor upsets of seeded players No. 14 Francesca Schiavone, No. 18 Marion Bartoli, and No. 23 Ai Sugiyama were at the hands of Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√°, Victoria Azarenka, and Anastasiya Yakimova respectively. No. 2 Am√©lie Mauresmo advanced soundly 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2 against Olga Poutchkova, as did No. 5 Nadia Petrova against Gisela Dulko 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2. Fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì1. Former World Number One, Serena Williams, advanced 7‚Äì6(4), 6‚Äì2 for the right to play Petrova in round three. At the end of Wednesday there were three American women remaining in the draw: Williams, Ashley Harkleroad and Laura Granville. Other seeded women to win were: No. 7 Elena Dementieva, No. 10 Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√°, No. 11 Jelena Jankoviƒá, No. 16 Shahar Pe'er, No. 20 Tatiana Golovin, No. 21 Katarina Srebotnik, and No. 26 Maria Kirilenko. Unseeded Maria Elena Camerin of Italy and Czech Eva Birnerov√° also advanced to the third round. =Day 4: 18 January= Lighter rains than the previous day were experienced resulting in minimal delays. Women‚Äôs Number One, Maria Sharapova advanced soundly over fellow Russian Anastassia Rodionova, 6‚Äì0, 6‚Äì3. Number 4 seed, Belgian Kim Clijsters also advanced in straight sets over Akiko Morigami, 6‚Äì3. 6‚Äì0. No. 6 Martina Hingis, No. 8 Patty Schnyder, No. 9 Dinara Safina, No. 19 Li Na, No. 22 Vera Zvonareva, No. 29 Alyona Bondarenko, and No.30 Tathiana Garbin all passed their second round tests in straight sets as well. Other seeded women #12 Anna Chakvetadze, #13 Ana Ivanovic, and #15 Daniela Hantuchov√° required three sets to advances to the third round. Crowd favourite, Aussie Alicia Molik, clawed her way into the third round against Kaia Kanepi after being down one set, 1‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2. The only seeded Australian woman in the draw, Samantha Stosur, on the other hand, fell to Croat Jelena Kostaniƒá To≈°iƒá, 6‚Äì4, 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2. Young American Ashley Harkleroad upset number 17 Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld of Germany, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2. Her compatriot Laura Granville was beaten by 12th seeded Anna Chakvetadze. Unseeded Japanese player Aiko Nakamura also advanced, defeating Indian Sania Mirza, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2. =Day 5: 19 January= Am√©lie Mauresmo advanced in straight sets, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì1 over Czech Eva Birnerov√° to advance to the fourth round. She would move on to face Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√° who won after only one set when opponent Anastasiya Yakimova had to retire. Former World Number One Serena Williams survived a miserable first set to defeat number 5 fiery Russian Nadia Petrova 1‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì3. Also advancing to be Serena‚Äôs opponent was Serbian upstart Jelena Jankoviƒá who won her match against Belarusian Victoria Azarenka soundly 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4. Number 3 Svetlana Kuznetsova advanced in straight sets over fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì4. Her opponent in the fourth round would be #16 Israeli Shahar Pe'er who survived a scare against #20 Tatiana Golovin being down a set to win 3‚Äì6, 7‚Äì5, 7‚Äì5 in one of the best matches on Day 5. Also advancing were number 7 Elena Dementieva and number 10 Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° who won their matches in straight sets against unseeded Maria Elena Camerin and number 21 Katarina Srebotnik, respectively. =Day 6: 20 January= Number one Maria Sharapova continued easily moving through the draw after surviving her Day 2 scare due to heat. She defeated 30 seed Tathiana Garbin 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì1. Her opponent in the fourth round would be fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, who surprisingly defeated number 13 Ana Ivanovic soundly 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2. Australian fan favourite Alicia Molik won her first set 6‚Äì3 against Swiss Patty Schnyder on Rod Laver Arena, but could not continue her pace, as Schnyder won 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì0. Number 4 Kim Clijsters defeated Alyona Bondarenko 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3 in a quick match. Number 6 Martina Hingis continued the great play of her comeback, winning 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì1 against Aiko Nakamura. Clijsters, Hingis, and Schnyder will all benefit from playing on the roofed courts during the rain experienced on Day 6, as their opponents on Day 8 will have to play on Day 7 as well. The matches delayed by rain were: #9 Dinara Safina v #16 Li Na, #12 Anna Chakvetadze v Jelena Kostaniƒá To≈°iƒá, and #15 Daniela Hantuchov√° v Ashley Harkleroad. The winners of those matches would play Hingis, Schnyder, and Clijsters, respectively. The roofed centre courts are always seen as an unfair advantage to the top players or the home country players, as they are able to complete matches on days affected by rain or heat, whereas their opponents are delayed and face playing on back-to-back days. =Day 7: 21 January= Day 7 saw five seeded players defeated by their opponents. Unseeded Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√° advanced to the quarterfinals courtesy of a 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3 surprising upset of defending champion and number two seed Am√©lie Mauresmo. Her opponent in the next round will be tenth-seed Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° who posted a 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3 upset of seventh-seed Elena Dementieva. Rising star Israeli Shahar Pe'er caused another upset by winning a 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2 over third- seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova to become the first Israeli woman to make a major quarter-final. Her opponent in the quarterfinals will be Serena Williams, who is enjoying her current role as a loose cannon, defeating eleventh-seed Jelena Jankoviƒá in a 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì2 win. The last remaining Asian representative, nineteenth-seed Li Na, won in a 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2 decision over ninth- seed Dinara Safina to advance to the fourth round. Twelfth-seed Anna Chakvetadze won against Croat Jelena Kostaniƒá To≈°iƒá 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì4. The young Ashley Harkleroad nearly caused another upset but failed to, with fifteenth-seed Daniela Hantuchov√° winning the match 6‚Äì7, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì3. The Li, Chakvetadze, and Hantuchov√° matches were delayed from day 6. =Day 8: 22 January= The other four fourth round matches all took the court on the eighth day, with three of the top eight seeds in play advancing. Top seed Maria Sharapova was pushed to two close sets by fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva but eventually prevailed 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì4. Fourth-seeded Belgian Kim Clijsters beat Daniela Hantuchov√°, who was playing for the second day in a row 6‚Äì1 7‚Äì5 to advance to the quarterfinals, where she was drawn to face Martina Hingis, who needed three sets to battle past the number one ranked Chinese player Li Na after being a set down. She won 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì0. The final match of the day was the only women's match to be played on Melbourne Arena, with the others all being on Rod Laver Arena. There the twelfth-seeded Russian Anna Chakvetadze pulled off a surprisingly easy 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì1 victory over former semi-finalist Patty Schnyder of Switzerland to advance to her first ever Grand Slam quarterfinal, and would next meet Sharapova. =Day 9: 23 January= The bottom half quarter-final line-up was scheduled to play today, with only two women's singles matches taking the court. The first pitted seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams against Shahar Pe'er of Israel. The unseeded Williams lost the first set 6‚Äì3 but grew in confidence in the second set to take it 6‚Äì2 and push it to a deciding set. Pe'er looked on-form for victory when she went up 6‚Äì5 in the final set, and just a few points from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to wrap up the 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì2, 8‚Äì6 victory and become one of the ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final. The other quarter-final followed after with Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° beating compatriot Lucie ≈†af√°≈ôov√° 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì4 to make her second major semi-final after the 2006 French Open. Vaidi≈°ov√° completely overpowered her fellow Czech in the first set, needing just thirty minutes to take it and compiling a 14‚Äì4 winner to unforced error ratio. Although ≈†af√°≈ôov√° gave more of a battle in the second set, Vaidi≈°ov√° was still too good for her and managed to close out the one hour eleven-minute match with ease. In the semi-finals she will face Serena Williams, the first meeting between the pair. =Day 10: 24 January= Top-seeded Maria Sharapova opened up play as the remaining four players in the top half of the draw took to the court. She was drawn to face another Russian Anna Chakvetadze. Sharapova showed her fighting spirit early on in the first set, coming back from 4‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì3 deficits to bring things to a first set tie-break, where she again fell behind at 5‚Äì3, before winning the last four points to take the first set 7‚Äì6(5). In the second set, Sharapova took several break point opportunities in the second set, before letting Chakvetadze back into the match but eventually she made it through to the semi-finals with a 7‚Äì6(5), 7‚Äì5 victory. Taking to the court after was Belgian Kim Clijsters and Swiss Martina Hingis in the last quarter-final to be contested, and one of the most anticipated match-ups thus far in the tournament. Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis at exactly the same stage before losing to Am√©lie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 unforced errors, but began to find her game in the second set. She raced to a 5‚Äì2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6‚Äì4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2‚Äì0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been drained from her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two unforced errors less than the Belgian. The semi- finals will feature Maria Sharapova against Kim Clijsters. =Day 11: 25 January= Both semi-finals were on the schedule on Day 11, with Serena Williams against Nicole Vaidi≈°ov√° first to take the court. Vaidi≈°ov√° broke early on for a 2‚Äì0 lead, but she squandered that advantage. At 5‚Äì4, the Czech had a chance to serve out the first set and take the advantage, but Williams fought back to take it to a tie-break and take the first set. In the second set, Williams continued to dominate moving ahead 5‚Äì1 and just points from wrapping up the victory, but it was Vaidi≈°ov√° who showed her fighting spirit saving four match points at 5‚Äì3 to Williams and then saving another in the last game of the match before Williams finally wrapped up the 7‚Äì6(5), 6‚Äì4 victory by converting her sixth match point and reach her first Grand Slam final since her Australian Open win two years previously. Immediately after, it was decided that she would face Maria Sharapova in the final, after the Russian ended the Australian Open career of Kim Clijsters, who is set to retire at the end of the season with a 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2 victory. The two broke each other constantly in the first set, with Clijsters eventually having the advantage at 4‚Äì3, before Sharapova reeled off six consecutive games to go up a set and 3‚Äì0. She held onto her serve for the rest of the match and broke once more in the last game to take the match and move into her third Grand Slam final. =Day 13: 27 January= The women's final was scheduled to be played on the Saturday, with two of the biggest stars on the WTA Tour in Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams set to face each other. The fans who expected a tough battle were eventually disappointed though, as Williams dominated the top-seeded Russian from start to finish. Her game was completely on form throughout the match, with Sharapova only managing to hold service once in the first set as Williams hit winner after winner. The second set was no different, although Sharapova managed to hold twice in the last set but Williams was too good and prevailed 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì2 to win her eighth Grand Slam title and her third Australian Open title. At the trophy presentation, Williams dedicated her win to Yetunde Price, her elder half-sister who was shot in September 2003. Williams became the third-lowest-ranked major titlist since 1975, after Evonne Goolagong and Chris O'Neil who won here in 1977 and 1978 respectively.

The second and third stories are revised versions of previously published stories. The first three stories are short stories, and the fourth and fifth are long enough to be called novellas (the fourth is over 44,500 words long, and the fifth is over 27,500 words long). The title is taken from 1 Corinthians 13:12, a deliberate misquotation of the passage which describes humanity as perceiving the world \\"through a glass darkly\\". Stories The stories, which belong to the Gothic horror and mystery genres, are presented as selections from the posthumous papers of the occult detective Dr. Martin Hesselius. =\\"Green Tea\\"= An English clergyman named Jennings confides to Hesselius that he is being followed by a demon in the form of an ethereal monkey, invisible to everyone else, which is trying to invade his mind and destroy his life. Hesselius writes letters to a Dutch colleague about the victim's condition, which gets steadily worse with time as the creature steps up its methods, all of which are purely psychological. The title refers to Hesselius' belief that green tea was what unsealed Jennings's \\"inner eye\\" and led to the haunting. Emanuel Swedenborg's book Arcana C≈ìlestia (1749) is cited on the power of demons. =\\"The Familiar\\"= A revised version of \\"The Watcher\\" (1851). A sea captain, living in Dublin, is stalked by \\"The Watcher\\", a strange dwarf who resembles a person from his past. He starts to hear accusatory voices all about him and eventually his fears solidify in the form of a sinister bird, a pet owl owned by his fianc√©e, Miss Montague. =\\"Mr. Justice Harbottle\\"= A revised version of \\"An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street\\" (1853). A cruel judge in the Court of Common Pleas, Elijah Harbottle, finds himself under attack by vengeful spirits, and in a disturbing dream he is condemned to death by a monstrous doppelg√§nger. The story is set between 1746 and 1748 and is retold by a Londoner, called Anthony Harman, from the account related in letters by an elderly friend. =The Room in the Dragon Volant= Not a ghost story but a notable mystery story, in 26 chapters, which includes the themes of drug-induced catalepsy and premature burial. A na√Øve young Englishman traveling in France attempts to save a beautiful and mysterious woman whom he is duped into believing to be the unhappily-married wife of the avaricious and sexagenarian count of St. Alyre. In the denouement it is revealed that the 'St. Alyres' belong to a gang of murderous thieves who bury their victims alive, having first paralysed them with a mysterious drug. The hero, young Richard Beckett, besotted with the gang's actress accomplice, narrowly escapes becoming the latest victim of their dastardly scheme. In the prologue Le Fanu describes the catalepsy- inducing drug employed by the St. Alyres as one of a class of 25 or so philtres known to mediaeval physicians, two of which are still used by the criminals of his hero, Dr. Hesselius's day. The effects of the (fictional) drug, however, are curiously reminiscent of those of the alkaloid bulbocapnine, which occurs in the medicinal herb Corydalis cava, a plant known to mediaeval herbalists. =Carmilla= A tale of a female vampire, set in Styria, Austria. This story was to greatly influence Bram Stoker in writing Dracula (1897). It also served as the basis for several works in other media, such as Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer's film Vampyr (1932), Hammer's film The Vampire Lovers (1970) and Carmilla a Canadian web series starring Natasha Negovanlis and Elise Bauman and directed by Spencer Maybee. Reception In a letter to Sidney Colvin from W.E. Henley, Henley stated that his friend Robert Louis Stevenson admired the book. Henley said \\"In a Glass Darkly was a book for which R.L.S. had a profound respect.\\" Henley also said that the book had inspired his and Stevenson's play, The Hanging Judge.Dury, Richard. ‚ÄúA Story-Teller: Stevenson on Le Fanu.‚Äù The Green Book: Writings on Irish Gothic, Supernatural and Fantastic Literature, no. 5, 2015, pp. 26‚Äì33.

Cultural travelers leave their home environment at home, bringing only themselves and a desire to become part of the culture they visit. Cultural travel goes beyond cultural exploration or discovery; it involves a transformation in way of life. This definition was first used by Gary Langer as a way of describing travel that requires a \\"transition\\" to a new level of understanding of and appreciation for a foreign culture. The term is often distorted and misused by travel agents, tour operators and international tourism organizations. Culture primarily has to do with people and less with places or things. So visiting museums, touring ancient structures, attending festivals, and eating local food does not provide the same experience as becoming a member of the culture itself. . Expeditions are another form of cultural travel, apart from slave trade travel that has given us an insight to various unknown and less talked about cultures. The discovery of cultures hence completely depends upon these travel narratives, which speak about what travelers witness, rather than accounts given by people in power. The antithesis of cultural travel is tourism, where people bring their home environment with them wherever they go and apply it to whatever they see.

In 1921, after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he published a memoir, Thirteen Years at the Russian Court, about his time with the family. In his memoirs, Gilliard described Tsarina Alexandra's torment over her son's haemophilia and her faith in the ability of starets Grigori Rasputin to heal the boy.Massie, Nicholas and Alexandra, 1967 Biography Pierre Gilliard was born on 16 May 1879 in Fiez, Switzerland. In his memoirs, Gilliard wrote that he initially came to Russia in 1904 as a French tutor to the family of Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a cousin of the Romanov family. He was recommended as a French tutor to the Tsar's children and began teaching the elder children, Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia in 1905. He grew fond of the family and followed them into internal exile at Tobolsk, Siberia, following the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Bolsheviks prevented Gilliard from joining his pupils when they were moved to the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg in May 1918.Klier and Mingay, p. 33; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 172 He described his final view of the children in his memoirs: Gilliard remained in Siberia after the murders of the family, assisting White Russian investigator Nicholas Sokolov. He married Alexandra \\"Shura\\" Tegleva, who had been a nurse to Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, in 1919. In Siberia, he was instrumental in unmasking an impostor who claimed to be the Tsarevich Alexei.Klier and Mingay, p. 77 In 1920, he returned to Switzerland via the Russian Far East. He became a French professor at the University of Lausanne and was awarded the French Legion of Honor.Massie, Nicholas and Alexandra, pp. 525‚Äì526 In 1921, he published a book entitled Le Tragique Destin de Nicholas II et de sa famille, which described the last days of the Tsar and his family, and the subsequent investigation into their deaths.Klier and Mingay, p. 76 In 1958, Gilliard was severely injured in a car accident in Lausanne. He never fully recovered and died four years later on 30 May 1962.Kurth, p. 300 Anna Anderson Tsarevich Alexei on board the imperial yacht Standart In 1925, the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, asked Gilliard and his wife to investigate the case of Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia.Klier and Mingay, p. 99; Kurth, p. 105; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 172; Phenix, p. 148 On 27 July 1925, the Gilliards saw Anderson at St. Mary's Hospital in Berlin, where Anderson was being treated for a tubercular infection of her arm. Anderson was severely ill, and semi-conscious. Madame Gilliard asked to examine Anderson's feet, and noted that Anderson's feet were shaped similarly to Anastasia's: both had bunions.Kurth, p. 106; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 172; Phenix, p. 149 Gilliard insisted that Anderson be moved to a better hospital, to ensure her survival while her identity was investigated.Kurth, p. 106; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 172 After an operation on Anderson's arm, she recuperated at the Mommsen Nursing Home in Berlin. There, in October 1925, the Gilliards saw Anderson again. Anderson did not recognise Gilliard, which she later claimed was because he had shaved off his goatee beard.Phenix, pp. 150‚Äì151 When he asked her to \\"tell me everything about your past\\", she refused.Kurth, p. 108; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 173 According to Gilliard, Anderson mistook Shura for Grand Duchess Olga on the second day of their visit.Klier and Mingay, p. 150 At a subsequent meeting, Anderson mimicked the actions of Anastasia when she asked Shura to moisten her forehead with eau de Cologne, which left Shura shaken.Kurth, p. 110; Phenix, p. 153 Anderson's supporters claimed that the Gilliards recognized Anderson as Anastasia, while the Gilliards denied it, and said her supporters mistook their compassion for recognition.Klier and Mingay, p. 101 Anderson's friend and lifelong supporter, Harriet von Rathlef, wrote that she spotted Gilliard in the hallway, looking agitated, and muttering in French, \\"My God, how awful! What has become of Grand Duchess Anastasia? She's a wreck, a complete wreck! I want to do everything I can to help the Grand Duchess!\\"Kurth, p. 111 Shura cried when she left Anderson, wondering why she loved the woman as much as she loved the grand duchess.Kurth, p. 112; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 173 On departure from the hospital, Gilliard told the Danish Ambassador in Berlin, Herluf Zahle, \\"We are going away without being able to say that she is not Grand Duchess Anastasia.\\" Gilliard later wrote to von Rathlef making further enquiries about Anderson's health, but he referred to her as \\"the invalid\\" rather than \\"Anastasia\\".Kurth, pp. 112‚Äì113 By the beginning of 1926, however, Gilliard was clearly of the opinion that Anderson was an impostor.Kurth, p. 117 While supporters of Anderson insisted that the Gilliards recognized her as Anastasia and then recanted, possibly the couple were hesitant at first because her emaciated condition made her look so different from the plump teenage Anastasia they had last seen.Klier and Mingay, pp. 101‚Äì102 While this was enough to suspend their initial doubts, they eventually decided, once she was better and they could question her more closely, that she was an impostor. Anderson's supporters accused Gilliard of turning his back on her because he was paid off by the Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse.Klier and Mingay, p. 103 Like Ernest Louis, Gilliard became a vociferous opponent of Anderson and her circle.Klier and Mingay, p. 126; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 174 Gilliard wrote articles and a book entitled The False Anastasia, which claimed she was a \\"vulgar adventuress\\" and a \\"first-rate actress\\".Kurth, p. 115; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 175 He said that he had known at once that she was not Anastasia, there was no facial resemblance, her entire knowledge of Russian imperial life was gleaned from magazines, books and her friends,Kurth, p. 116; Massie, The Romanovs, p. 175 and she could not speak Russian, English or French.Kurth, p. 116 He testified against her in Hamburg in 1958.Kurth, pp. 298‚Äì300 The lawsuits, designed to determine whether she was truly the grand duchess, eventually ended inconclusively in 1970, after Gilliard's death.Klier and Mingay, p. 139; Kurth, p. 377 Decades later, DNA tests were carried out in 1995, which proved that Anderson was not Anastasia, but was a Polish woman by the name of Franziska Schanzkowska.

His research has focused on the development of X-ray and synchrotron radiation techniques and their applications in different scientific fields with emphasis on surface science and magnetism. During his career he also held several scientific leadership positions, such as the director of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) and he was the founding director of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), the world's first x-ray free electron laser. Career St√∂hr was born in Meinerzhagen, Germany. His university education was at Bonn University and Washington State University, where he spent two years as a Fulbright scholar and received a Master of Science degree. In 1974 he received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Technical University of Munich. After postdoctoral work and a scientific staff position at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory he worked as a staff scientist at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) and at EXXON Corporate Research Laboratory. He then spent nearly fifteen years at the IBM Almaden Research Center, where he conducted x-ray research in the areas of surface science and magnetic materials and managed various research departments. He became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1988. In January 2000, he joined the faculty of Stanford University as Professor and was appointed Deputy Director of SSRL. In 2005 he became the fourth Director of SSRL and an Associate Director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). From 2009‚Äì2013 he was the first Director of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). He became Emeritus Professor at Stanford in 2015. He is presently writing his third book entitled \\"The Nature of X-Rays and their Interactions with Matter\\". Besides his books, Dr. St√∂hr is the author of more than 250 scientific publications and several patents. He has served on many national and international advisory committees, most notably, the Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (BESAC) of the U.S. Department of Energy. In 2011 he was awarded the Davisson‚ÄìGermer Prize in Atomic or Surface Physics by the American Physical Society. Research Prof. St√∂hr‚Äôs research has focused on the development of novel investigative techniques based on soft x-ray synchrotron radiation for exploring the structure, electronic and magnetic properties of surfaces and thin films. He played a major role in developing the surface extended x-ray absorption fine structure (SEXAFS) technique as a tool for exploring surface structures, especially atoms bonded to surfaces. He also developed the near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) technique for the study of simple and complex molecules bonded to surfaces and for the study of thin polymer films. The technique is described in his book ‚ÄúNEXAFS Spectroscopy‚Äù (Springer, 1992). NEXAFS is widely used today, often in combination with x-ray microscopes, for the study of organic systems like polymers and biological cells. Starting in the early 1990s he has concentrated on the use of polarized soft x-rays to study magnetic materials and phenomena, especially thin films, interfaces and nanoscale structures. He has pioneered x-ray magnetic spectro-microscopy which allows the direct observation of nanoscale antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domain structures with elemental and chemical state specificity. He has also pioneered time-resolved x-ray microscopy techniques with picosecond time resolution. These studies and more generally the whole field of magnetism form the topic of his second book, ‚ÄúMagnetism ‚Äì From Fundamentals to Nanoscale Dynamics‚Äù (Springer, 2006), which he co-authored with Hans Christoph Siegmann. His latest interest is the development and exploration of non-linear x-ray phenomena. Such phenomena could be conveniently ignored during the first one hundred years of x-ray science because even for the most advanced synchrotron radiation sources, x-ray interactions with matter proceeded one-photon-at-a- time. Similar to the advent of conventional lasers in the 1960s, the emergence of x-ray lasers now requires the extension of the conventional description of x-ray interactions with matter through the concepts of quantum optics. Experiments and theory of non-linear effects, where two or more x-rays work together, are a central part of his new book.

The calculated aortic valve orifice area is currently one of the measures for evaluating the severity of aortic stenosis. A valve area of less than 1.0 cm2 is considered to be severe aortic stenosis. There are many ways to calculate the valve area of aortic stenosis. The most commonly used methods involve measurements taken during echocardiography. For interpretation of these values, the area is generally divided by the body surface area, to arrive at the patient's optimal aortic valve orifice area. Planimetry Planimetry is the tracing out of the opening of the aortic valve in a still image obtained during echocardiographic acquisition during ventricular systole, when the valve is supposed to be open. While this method directly measures the valve area, the image may be difficult to obtain due to artifacts during echocardiography, and the measurements are dependent on the technician who has to manually trace the perimeter of the open aortic valve. Because of these reasons, planimetry of aortic valve is not routinely performed. The continuity equation The continuity equation states that the flow in one area must equal the flow in a second area if there are no shunts between the two areas. In practical terms, the flow from the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is compared to the flow at the level of the aortic valve. In echocardiography the aortic valve area is calculated using the velocity time integral (VTI) which is the most accurate method and preferred. The flow through the LVOT, or LV stroke volume (in cm3), can be calculated by measuring the LVOT diameter (in cm), squaring that value, multiplying the value by 0.78540 (which is œÄ/4) giving a cross sectional area of the LVOT (in cm2) and multiplying that value by the LVOT VTI (in cm), measured on the spectral Doppler display using pulsed-wave Doppler. From these, it is easy to calculate the area (in cm2) of the aortic valve by simply dividing the LV stroke volume (in cm3) by the AV VTI (in cm) measured on the spectral Doppler display using continuous-wave Doppler. Stroke volume = 0.785(œÄ/4) x Diameter2 x VTI of LVOT Cross sectional area of LVOT = 0.785(œÄ/4) x LVOT Diameter2 \\\\text{Aortic Valve Area (in cm}^2\\\\text{)} = {\\\\text{LVOT diameter}^2 \\\\cdot 0.78540 \\\\cdot \\\\text{LVOT VTI}\\\\over \\\\text{Aortic Valve VTI}} { cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" -  width=\\"10%\\"  width=\\"80%\\" bgcolor=\\"#EEEEFF\\"  Example: An individual undergoes transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of a systolic ejection murmur with delayed carotid upstroke noted on physical examination. During echocardiography, the following measurements were made: LVOT diameter of 2 cm, LVOT VTI of 24 cm, and an Aortic Valve VTI of 50 cm. What is the aortic valve area?  width=\\"10%\\" -  width=\\"10%\\"  bgcolor=\\"#EEEEFF\\"  Answer: An LVOT diameter of 2 cm gives a LVOT cross-sectional area of, 2 * 2 * 0.78540 = 3.14 cm2. To calculate stroke volume, multiply the cross-sectional area of 3.14 cm2 by the LVOT VTI 24 cm. This gives an LV stroke volume of 3.14 * 24 = 75.40 cc. Divide the LV stroke volume, 75.40 cc by the Aortic Valve VTI, 50 cm and this gives an aortic valve area of 75.40 / 50 = 1.51 cm2.  width=\\"10%\\" } The weakest aspect of this calculation is the variability in measurement of LVOT area, because it involves squaring the LVOT dimension. Therefore, it is crucial for the sonographer to take great care in measuring the LVOT diameter. The measurement using echocardiogram may be inaccurate in cases of Aortic subvalvular stenosis, because there is not a uniform diameter, as assumed during echocardiogram. The viewpoint of the echocardiogram may distort the true diameter of the LVOT in some patients. For verification purposes of the obtained valve area using echocardiogram and doppler measures, especially if the obtained valve area is in the range requiring surgery and cardiac output is low, the Gold standard of left heart catheterization for true hemodynamics should be obtained for validation using the Gorlin formula, so patient does not go for unneeded surgery. The Gorlin equation The Gorlin equation states that the aortic valve area is equal to the flow through the aortic valve during ventricular systole divided by the systolic pressure gradient across the valve times a constant. The flow across the aortic valve is calculated by taking the cardiac output (measured in liters per minute) and dividing it by the heart rate (to give output per cardiac cycle) and then dividing it by the systolic ejection period measured in seconds per beat (to give flow per ventricular contraction). \\\\text{Valve Area (in cm}^2\\\\text{)} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Cardiac Output }(\\\\frac{\\\\text{ml}}{\\\\text{min}})}{\\\\text{Heart rate }(\\\\frac{\\\\text{beats}}{\\\\text{min}})\\\\cdot \\\\text{Systolic ejection period (s)}\\\\cdot 44.3 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\text{mean Gradient (mmHg)}}} The Gorlin equation is related to flow across the valve. Because of this, the valve area may be erroneously calculated as stenotic if the flow across the valve is low (i.e. if the cardiac output is low). The measurement of the true gradient is accomplished by temporarily increasing the cardiac output by the infusion of positive inotropic agents, such as dobutamine. { cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" -  width=\\"10%\\"  width=\\"80%\\" bgcolor=\\"#EEEEFF\\"  Example: An individual undergoes left and right heart cardiac catheterization as part of the evaluation of aortic stenosis. The following hemodynamic parameters were measured. With a heart rate of 80 beats/minute and a systolic ejection period of 0.33 seconds, the cardiac output was 5 liters/minute. During simultaneous measurement of pressures in the left ventricle and aorta (with the use of one catheter in the left ventricle and a second in the ascending aorta), the mean systolic pressure gradient was measured at 50 mmHg.

The resulting simplified formula is: \\\\text{Aortic Valve area (in cm}^2\\\\text{)} \\\\approx\\\\frac{\\\\text{Cardiac Output} (\\\\frac{\\\\text{litre}}{\\\\text{min}})}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\text{Peak to Peak Gradient (mmHg)}}} { cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" -  width=\\"10%\\"  width=\\"80%\\" bgcolor=\\"#EEEEFF\\"  Example: An individual undergoes left and right cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of aortic stenosis.

A Glaswegian schoolteacher, in 1886, Todd became one of the first students at the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women after hearing that the Scottish Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons had opened their exams to women. She took eight years to complete the four-year course because, using the pseudonym Graham Travers, during her studies she wrote a novel, Mona Maclean, Medical Student. This was described by Punch magazine as \\"a novel with a purpose ‚Äî no recommendation for a novel, more especially when the purpose selected is that of demonstrating the indispensability of women-doctors\\". After graduating in 1894, she took her MD in Brussels. Career She was appointed Assistant Medical Officer at Edinburgh Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children but retired after five years. Her first book was well-received. She later published Fellow Travellers and Kirsty O' The Mill Toun in 1896, followed by Windyhaugh in 1898, always using her male pen name, although her real identity was known by then and mentioned in reviews of her books. By 1906, even her publishers added \\"Margaret Todd, M.D.\\" in parentheses after her pseudonym. In addition to six novels, she wrote short stories for magazines. =Isotopes= Todd was a family friend of chemist Frederick Soddy, then a lecturer at the University of Glasgow. In 1913, Soddy explained to her the research on radioactivity for which he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921. He had shown that some radioactive elements have more than one atomic mass, although the chemical properties are identical, so that atoms of different masses occupy the same place in the periodic table. Todd suggested that such atoms be named isotopes, Greek for at the same place.Scerri, Eric R. The Periodic Table (Oxford University Press 2007), chap.6, note 44 (p.312) citing Alexander Fleck, described as a former student of Soddy's This term was accepted and used by Soddy, and has become standard scientific nomenclature. Personal life Todd was the romantic partner of Dr Sophia Jex-Blake, founder of Todd's university and place of employment. On Jex-Blake's retirement in 1899, they moved to Windydene, Mark Cross, where Todd wrote The Way of Escape (1902) and Growth (1906). After Jex-Blake's death, she wrote The Life of Dr Sophia Jex-Blake (1918) under her own name, describing the fight of women in the 19th century to enter the medical profession. The Times described it as \\"almost too laboriously minute for the general reader\\" but it received praise in other publications. Death and legacy Todd died aged 59, three months after her book on Jex-Blake was published. According to one source, she died by suicide; her Times obituary states only that she died in a nursing home in London. After her death, a scholarship was created in her name at the LSMW. She left ¬£3,000 in her will () to be used to promote the advancement of women in medicine. Selected works * Graham Travers.

Aviation Support Branch The Aviation Support Branch currently has a fleet of two Cessna Citation jets and five helicopters, including a Kawasaki BK117 transporter, jointly owned by the NSW Fire Brigades and primarily used to respond to major incidents including HAZMAT, Urban Search & Rescue (USAR), bushfire operations and counter-terrorism/special operations . The Branch also have four Eurocopter Squirrel's for general police work. These are used where required to support searches for missing bushwalkers, vessels or aircraft, specialised rescue missions, bushfire fighting and reconnaissance . Marine Area Command NSW has a large and busy coastline leading to an expansive system of waterways. NSW Police Force maintains a full-time, comprehensive water police service designated the \\"Marine Area Command\\". The NSW Police Marine Area Command's (MAC) responsibility extends to all coastal areas of NSW to out to sea. From the earliest days of settlement, the state has required a dedicated water based policing service. The services provided by MAC are similar to those carried out by land-based police, including crime prevention and detection, search and rescue and high visibility patrols. Police vessels and personnel are strategically located at important commercial and leisure ports and harbours along the New South Wales coast, with headquarters at Balmain in Sydney Harbour. They are also based at Broken Bay, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Coffs Harbour, Botany Bay, Port Kembla and most recently Eden. Some remote country waterways are serviced by their Local Area Commands such as Deniliquin in the State's far south west . The NSW Water Police hold the distinction of being the first civilian form of policing established in NSW. In 1789, one year after the colony was founded, Governor Phillip created a 12-person \\"Row Boat Guard\\" to patrol Sydney Cove for smugglers and convicts attempting to pass letters to ships anchored in the harbour. By 1830 an independent Water Police Force was operating. It was merged, with all other Police units, into the NSW Police Department in 1862. In the late-19th century, the Water Police entered the 'modern era' of combustion engines with two steam launches, the 'Bileola' and the 'Argus'. These were used for nearly 35 years before they were replaced with motor launches. With the introduction of the NSW Police Marine Area Command in July 1999, equipment includes 11 sea going craft and a number of smaller boats, all with electronic navigational aids. MAC employs 123 personnel, including operational water police, marine intelligence unit, marine crime prevention officer, divers, detectives and the Marine Operational Support Team (MOST). \\"MOST\\" is the Marine Area Commands version of the Public Order and Riot Squad and assists with operations such as ship boarding and crowd control.

Historians disagree over the time period during which the expansion took place, but estimate it occurred roughly between 1550 and 1850. Amerindian peoples of the pampas, such as the Puelche, Pehuenche, and Tehuelche, adopted the Mapudungun language as their main language (both of their names are in Mapudungun). Together with Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, and Nahuatl, Mapudungun was among the few Amerindian languages that expanded in use on the continents after the beginning of European colonization. This area of the Patagonia was generally isolated from European settlement until late in the 19th century. The Mapuche who migrated to Patagonia lived often as nomads. As European settlers established frontier settlements, the Mapuche raided them for cattle or looted their produce. They drove off the cattle stolen in the incursions (malones) and took them to Chile through the mountain passes to trade for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called Camino de los chilenos and ran a length of about from Buenos Aires Province to the mountain passes of Neuqu√©n Province. The lonco Calfucur√° crossed the Andes from Chile to the Pampas around 1830 to aid the indigenous people, after Juan Manuel de Rosas, the governor of Buenos Aires, started to fight the Boreanos tribe. However, other sources directly contradict this statement, saying that de Rosas contacted the leader in Chile for help fighting against the Boreanos tribe. In 1859 Calfucur√° attacked Bah√≠a Blanca in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. Many other bands of Mapuche also became involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until the Conquest of the Desert. To counter the cattle raids (and the native peoples on horseback), in the 1870s Argentina constructed a deep trench, called Zanja de Alsina, to prevent cattle from being driven west and establish a boundary to the raiding tribes in the pampas. Argentine authorities were worried that strong connections between the Araucanized tribes and Chile would give Chile influence over the pampas. Both Argentina and Chile claimed the Patagonia. The Argentine government feared that in case of war, the natives would side with the Chileans, who would be able to carry the war all the way to the vicinity of Buenos Aires. In 1872 Cufulcur√° and his 6,000 followers went across the pampas to attack the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio, resulting in the deaths of 300 settlers and the loss of 200,000 head of cattle, which the Mapuche drove back to Chile. After this, Argentina organized its forces to launch what it called the Conquest of the Desert and attacked indigenous people for years. It is estimated that more than 5000 native peoples were killed or captured in that major assault, which was facilitated by the new Remington weapon arming the 6,000 Argentine soldiers (as stated by Gen. Ignacio Fotheringham) [Bodley p. 63, 72]. However, the losses to the Army were minimal, with only 13 soldiers killed;[3] the lop-sided 'victory' was taken as proof of European superiority and celebrated in art. Until December 2012, the 100 peso bill of Argentina had a picture honoring the Conquest of the Desert on one side.

Royal Air Force career  Hazelden trained as a pilot in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve before the outbreak of the Second World War. He joined the Royal Air Force in May 1939 and completed his flying training on Ansons at 12 Flying Training School located at RAF Redhill in Surrey. He joined No. 44 Squadron RAF with Bomber Command at RAF Waddington in September 1940, flying Handley Page Hampden twin-engine bombers. In 1941, after surviving one tour of duty, Hazeldon underwent operational conversion training for the Avro Manchester twin-engined bomber at RAF Finningley in Yorkshire. He joined No. 83 Squadron RAF at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire. He remained with No. 83 Squadron during its conversion to the Avro Lancaster four-engined bomber. In July 1942, after a tour of operations during which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he became a flying instructor at RAF Bassingbourn, then RAF Wescott, and finally RAF Oakley. He was later chief flying instructor for the Vickers Wellington and he was a member of the inaugural class at the Empire Test Pilots' School at RAF Boscombe Down.Brookes, Andrew, Destination Disaster, page 24, Ian Allan,  Civilian test pilot career  Hazelden left the RAF in 1947 and he was appointed as the chief test pilot of Handley Page. Notably, he carried out the flight test development of the Hastings military transport, the Victor four-jet nuclear weapon carrying V bomber (and later tanker aircraft), and the Hermes and Dart Herald airliners. His skill as a pilot enabled him to survive several in- flight failures of prototype aircraft, including that of the prototype Dart Herald, which he was able to crash-land after a catastrophic engine fire en route to the Farnborough Airshow on 28 August 1958. With his wife and seven other passengers on board, he belly-landed the airliner in a small field, getting over trees, under some power lines, and avoiding a farm roller parked in the field. The aircraft was a total loss, but there were no deaths or serious injuries, as all on board escaped through a hole torn in the aircraft by a concealed tree stump. A Victor suffered a landing gear failure and had to be belly-landed on the grass runway at RAF Scampton. More damage was caused by the recovery of the aircraft than by the crash. In all cases, Hazelden was able to report in meticulous detail the events leading up to the crash. Later career When Handley Page went into voluntary liquidation in March 1970, Hazelden flew for small airlines for several years, and then retired to Lincolnshire. He became president of the Handley Page Association in 1978. Personal life He married Esma May Jones in 1942, with whom he had a daughter Valerie.

In 1862 he was graduated, and received his rabbinical diploma from the S√©minaire Isra√©lite de France at Paris, which had replaced (1859) the Metz √âcole Centrale Rabbinique.  Activities  Loeb did not immediately enter upon a rabbinical career, but tutored for some years, first at Bayonne, France and then at Paris. In 1865 he was called to the rabbinate of St. Etienne (Loire). His installation sermon, on the duties of the smaller congregations (Les Devoirs des Petites Communaut√©s), is one of the best examples of French pulpit rhetoric. Soon, however, he felt a desire to extend the field of his activity. He went to Paris, where he was appointed (June 1, 1869) secretary of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, which position he held until his death. It was largely due to Loeb's labors that this association became an important factor in the progress of Oriental Judaism; and he created the library of the Alliance, which is one of the most valuable Jewish libraries in existence. Meanwhile, he continued his historical and philological researches, and developed an extensive literary activity. The chair of Jewish history in the Rabbinical Seminary of Paris having become vacant through the death of Albert Cohn (1877), Loeb was appointed his successor. He held this position for 12 years. His main activity, however, was devoted to the Soci√©t√© des Etudes Juives, which was organized in Paris in 1880. Beginning with the first number, he successfully edited the Revue des √âtudes Juives, the organ of that society, and was, moreover, a voluminous and brilliant contributor thereto. The following works published by Loeb deserve especial notice: * La Situation des Isra√©lites en Turquie, en Serbie, et en Roumanie (1869) * Biographie d'Albert Cohn (1878) * Tables du Calendrier Juif Depuis l'Ere Chr√©tienne Jusqu'au XXX Si√®cle * La controverse sur le Talmud sous saint Louis (1881) * Les Juifs de Russie (1891) * La Litt√©rature des Pauvres dans la Bible * R√©flexions sur les Juifs.

She claimed the photographing was a violation of her right to privacy under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court held that under Quebec law a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject. The Court limited this requirement to exclude persons whose photographs were taken during an event of public interest. That is, a person of public interest or equally an unknown person who is implicated in a public matter cannot claim image rights. Consequently, anyone whose photograph was incidental to a photo of some matter will be treated as part of the background and will not be able to claim their rights were violated.  Background  In 1987, Gilbert Duclos, a photographer for √âditions Vice-Versa took a photograph of a teenaged Pascale Claude Aubry resting on the steps of a building by a public street in Montreal. The photo was published in an edition issue alongside essays about life in Montreal and Vancouver. After Aubry's classmates saw the photo and laughed at her, she initiated a lawsuit against the magazine and the photographer. Both sides agreed that the photo was taken in a public place and without Aubry's consent. Aubry argued that the photograph violated her privacy rights under Section 4 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which says that ‚Äú[e]very person has a right to respect for his private life.‚Äù √âditions Vice-Versa argued that such an interpretation would violate its Section 3 right to free expression found in the same document. Aubry was awarded $1500 in damages in the lower courts, and the defendants appealed the decision from the Quebec Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.  Ruling  The Court held that under Quebec law a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject. The Court limited this requirement to exclude persons whose photographs were taken during an event of public interest. That is, a person of public interest or equally an unknown person who is implicated in a public matter cannot claim image rights. Consequently, anyone whose photograph was incidental to a photo of some matter will be treated as part of the background and will not be able to claim their rights were violated. Aftermath Photojournalist and photographers groups took issue with the decision, arguing that it had the potential to create a chilling effect on their profession. Justice Bastarache later referred to the case in Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem (2004), to discuss how the Quebec Charter is relevant to personal disputes.Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, para. 153. The photo became part of the public domain since it was handed to the Supreme Court. By the time of the decision in April 1998, √âditions Vice-Versa was defunct.

This is usually used to describe elections to a governmental body (generally a legislature) that are staggered so that the number of offices of that body would not be up for election at the same time. Only a fraction of a body's seats are up for election while others are not until the terms of the next set of members are to expire. The legislators may have the same or longer fixed term of office as the executive, which facilitates an election mid-term of the tenure of the higher office. In the United States, the president and vice president are elected every four years in indirect (electoral college) presidential elections. The legislative bodies of the United States are the Senate (who serve six year terms) and House of Representatives (2 year terms). The Senate has one-third of its members up for election every two years while the House has all its membership up for election every two years. Regarding elections to the United States Congress, the point of reference is the president's term. There are three classes of United States Senators; each election replaces one class, hence a \\"midterm election\\" appears as one-third through the term of one class and two- thirds through the other, while still midway the term of a president. In addition to federal legislative bodies, governors of 36 states and three territories are also up for election during a midterm election. Meanwhile, although the Philippines and Liberia also conduct midterm elections, the winners of such elections take office in their respective legislative bodies that conduct such elections midway through the term of half of the other members, hence for the members who were not up for election, the incoming members take office midway through their terms. While the House of Councillors of Japan uses a staggered election, there are no fixed terms to compare with as the House of Representatives has a variable term, and the position of the emperor is hereditary. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister of Japan is elected by the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister usually would take the responsibilities following the House of Councillors election results, include resignation or cabinet reshuffle. Conversely, in Cyprus, while the House of Representatives is elected for a fixed term of five years, and renewed entirely in each election, House elections are scheduled to be held in the middle of the President's own five-year term. The results of such a midterm election serve as a measuring stick to the popularity of the incumbent executive, although in the United States the governing party has suffered election defeats for most of the time. In European countries where parliamentary systems of government are prevalent, whilst local, regional, and European Parliamentary elections are used as a proxy measuring stick for how popular the governing party is outside of a national parliamentary election year; they are not midterms in the sense that they are not necessarily held at exactly the midpoint between scheduled national parliamentary or presidential elections.

It was a heavily built animal with a length of about snout to tail-tip, a weight estimated at ,http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/16838?show=full (in spanish) and could potentially assume a slight bipedal stance.  Description  Restoration of G. robustum Sloths are grouped into three categories: mylodontids, megalonychids, and megatheriids. Glossotherium belongs to the Mylodontidae, in which it is further subcategorized into the Mylodontinae, characterized both by the loss of the entepicondylar foramen of the distal humerus and anteriorly broad snouts. Mylodontinae has five genera: Lestodon, Thinobadistes, Mylodon, Paramylodon, and Glossotherium. The latter three have frequently been confused for each other in scientific literature, though it is likely Paramylodon and Glossotherium share a more recent common ancestor than with any other mylodontid. Paramylodon is typically larger than Glossotherium, even though there is overlap in their size ranges, and Glossotherium is generally wider and more robust with a diagnostic increased amount of lateral flare at the predental spout. Glossotherium robustum was endemic to South America and weighed about 1500 kg. Pleistocene records indicate that it was widely distributed between 20‚Å∞S and 40‚Å∞S, with a range spanning across Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay. = Dentition = Sloths have an ever-growing adult dentition. They lack deciduous dentition and have a reduction in tooth number. Sloth teeth also lack the enamel and cuspation pattern generally present in other mammals. Their tooth forms are oval, subrectangular, or elongate irregular ovoid with chisel-shaped ‚Äúcaniniform‚Äù teeth anteriorly and ‚Äúmolariform‚Äù cheek teeth. Glossotherium has a layer of cementum surrounding all molariform cheek teeth with some traces on caniniform teeth. Cheek teeth in Glossotherium are larger, have more complex shapes, and retain more of the cementum layer around all sides of each tooth than the Shasta ground sloth, Nothrotheriops shastensis, and tree sloths.  Discovery  G. robustum in Vienna Fossils of this animal have been found in South America and Mexico.http://paleodb.org/cgi- bin/bridge.pl?a=checkTaxonInfo&taxon;_no=43634 It is closely related to Paramylodon of North America, whose specimens have often been confused with it and assigned to Glossotherium, which in turn was initially assigned to Mylodon. The earliest Glossotherium specimens are known from the Pliocene of South America and are represented by the species, G. chapadmalense. All specimens of Pleistocene age are typically lumped into G. robustum and a few other questionable species. Further research is needed at the species level.  Palaeobiology  Due to its size and strength, Glossotherium would have had few natural enemies apart from the South American short-faced bear Arctotherium and sabre-toothed cats such as Smilodon. It is believed to have died out in the Pleistocene (1.8 million - 12,000 years ago). The most recent reported date is about 8700 years BP. = Diet = Juvenile G. robustum Details of Glossotherium‚Äôs diet are unclear since no dung deposits are available for analysis. However, based on dental evidence, Glossotherium was likely more suited to grazing, though it was also probably less efficient at ingesting grasses since its dental apparatus was more suited to shearing, which would have been too ineffective at processing plant materials down to an ingestible size to obtain adequate nutritive value. More recent tree sloths have a very slow rate of passage of food through the gut and it is likely that Glossotherium did as well. With a likely low metabolic rate, a large body size, a consequently reduced energy requirement for its weight, and an extraordinarily large gut that likely had a foregut fermentation site, Glossotherium could probably survive better on foods of lower nutritional value than other sloths could. Though it is likely Glossotherium primarily ate grasses, it also probably ate a variety of foliage as well and would be better considered a ‚Äúbrowser-grazer‚Äù than simply a grazer. = Hearing = Glossotherium had large ear ossicles, similar to those in elephants, which imply the loss of hearing acuity of higher frequencies, further implying an advantage for sensing low frequency sounds, infrasound, or bone-conducting seismic waves. Low frequency sound is useful for long range communication and it is possible that ground sloths used low frequency communication in much the same way that it is utilized by elephants. Sloths may have used low frequency sounds for communication in mating calls or other social interactions, or for long-range sound sensing as in predator-prey interactions or weather forecasting. Another possible explanation for hearing in low frequencies may be due to fossorial habits: low hearing frequencies coupled with a short interaural distance suggest that Glossotherium probably had very poor sound localization. This indicates evidence of an underground lifestyle since loss of high frequency hearing is common to fossorial mammals. Glossotherium‚Äôs huge nostrils were likely effective for sound emission, with expanded nares possibly related to emission of low frequency sounds up to 600 Hz.

Known as Big Edie, she was a sister of John Vernou Bouvier III and an aunt of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her life and relationship with her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale was highlighted in the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens. Biography Beale's parents were Maude Frances Sergeant and John Vernou Bouvier Jr., the paternal grandparents of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. Her siblings were John Vernou Bouvier III; William Sergeant \\"Bud\\" Bouvier (1893‚Äì1929), who died from alcoholism; and twin sisters Maude Reppelin Bouvier Davis (1905‚Äì1999) and Michelle Caroline Bouvier Scott Putnam (1905‚Äì1987). Beale pursued an amateur singing career and in 1917 married lawyer/financier Phelan Beale (who worked at her father's law firm Bouvier and Beale) in a lavish ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. The couple lived at 987 Madison Avenue (now the site of the Carlyle Hotel). They had three children: daughter Edith (who was referred to as \\"Little Edie\\", 1917‚Äì2002) and two sons (Phelan Beale, Jr., 1920‚Äì1993, and Bouvier Beale, 1922‚Äì1994). In 1923, Phelan Beale purchased the Grey Gardens mansion in the Georgica neighborhood of East Hampton, a block from the Atlantic Ocean. The Beales separated in 1931, with Edith retaining the Grey Gardens house. Edith received child support, but no form of alimony. She continued to pursue her singing career, giving recitals in her home and at local functions. Her sons went to college and World War II duty and had families of their own. In 1946, Phelan Beale notified her of their divorce via telegram from Mexico. In July 1952, Beale's daughter Edith (known as \\"Little Edie\\") returned after five years in Manhattan to live permanently at Grey Gardens. Grey Gardens in January 2009 In October 1971, police raided Grey Gardens and found the 28-room house \\"full of litter, rife with the odor of cats and in violation of various local ordinances\\". The Suffolk County, New York Board of Health prepared to evict Beale and \\"Little Edie\\" due to the unsafe condition of the property. Following the publicity, Beale's family paid a reported $30,000 to refurbish the property, settle back taxes, and give Beale and \\"Little Edie\\" a stipend (the two women's trust fund income had run out some years before). The eviction proceedings were dropped. Beale's niece Lee Radziwill hired documentary filmmakers Albert and David Maysles in 1972 to work on a film about the Bouvier family. At the outset, the brothers filmed Beale and \\"Little Edie\\". The original film project was not completed, and Radziwill kept the footage that had been shot of the Beales. The Maysles brothers were fascinated by the strange life the two women led. After raising funds for film and equipment on their own they returned and filmed 70 more hours of footage with Beale and \\"Little Edie\\". The resulting film, titled Grey Gardens (1976), is widely considered a masterpiece of the documentary genre. It was later adapted as a 2006 musical of the same name, in which the characters Lee and Jackie Bouvier appear as visiting children in retrospect. An HBO television movie based upon the documentary and surrounding story of the Beales' lives, also called Grey Gardens, appeared in 2009. Beale died of pneumonia at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, New York. Her body is buried in the Bouvier family plot at Most Holy Trinity Catholic Cemetery in East Hampton. As Beale neared her death, \\"Little Edie\\" reportedly asked if she had any final thoughts. Beale replied: \\"There's nothing more to say.

Early life  Ward was born in Adelaide, South Australia.  Career  Ward began his career at an early age with roles on stage and radio. In his late teens he travelled to Tahiti to begin writing what became the controversial novel and film, The Set. The film was produced in 1970 and the novel was not published until 2011. Despite his success as a writer, he was script editor for Homicide, adapted his novel Reflex into the film Brothers and wrote other documentaries and specials. Ward has featured or starred in over fifteen hundred television shows and more than fifty films alongside such luminaries as Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard, Richard Harris, Barry Sullivan, Robert Lansing, Ryan O'Neal, Richard Benjamin, Tom Selleck, Paula Prentiss, Peter Graves, Alan Rickman, Steve Railsback, Olivia Hussey and Laura San Giacomo. In Mad Max he created the memorable \\"Fifi\\" the bald headed police hall captain, The Man From Hong Kong had him as the bumbling Aussie cop, Inspector Bob Taylor. In Stone he was the comedic biker perve, \\"Hooks\\". Turkey Shoot saw him as \\"Ritter\\" the guard from hell and in Quigley Down Under he played Brophy, one of the outlaw gang. He was an Irish mounted cop in The Irishman and an all-singing, dancing pirate in The Pirate Movie. He played the long-running character \\"Weppo\\" the rock and rolling garbage collector in Number 96 and a boxer in Boys from the Bush and The Sullivans. At home on stage, television or films, Ward is one of the few actors bridging the gap into the Indi renaissance of the millennium. He has, during this period, featured or starred in Long Weekend, Bad Behaviour, Elimination Game, Death's Waiting Room, Choir Girl, Debt Collector, Devils Detour, Boar and Faceless Man. He will continue the trend with further work during 2019.

They lie in western central Fife and Perth and Kinross, Scotland. At West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife. Etymology The name Lomond Hills was first recorded Lomondys in 1315, and may derive from a Pictish cognate of Welsh llumon, meaning \\"beacon\\", an element found for example in the hill-name Pumlumon in Wales. Also suggested is derivation from Gaelic lom monadh, \\"bare hill\\", perhaps adapted from an earlier Pictish name containing cognate elements. Physical geography The Lomond Hills contain two prominent peaks, West Lomond and East Lomond (or Falkland Hill)https://fife-placenames.glasgow.ac.uk/placename/?id=1103 (), which sit just under apart above a long north and west-facing escarpment over in length. The escarpment, made from beds of sandstone, limestone and a quartz-dolerite sill, rises steeply from the low ground to the north and west to a plateau of around in height between the peaks of East and West Lomond. The western portion of the escarpment runs southwards from West Lomond beyond the deep valley of the Glen Burn (Glen Vale) to Bishop Hill (locally, simply The Bishop) (). The steep-sided peaks of East and West Lomond themselves are volcanic in origin. Along the edges of the sandstone bed at the foot of the scarp slopes are several strikingly eroded outcrops, the most famous of which are the Bunnet Stane and John Knox's Pulpit, so named because it is believed to be a spot where covenanters held conventicles in the 17th century. There are also striking outcrops in the columnar jointing at the edge of the dolerite sill on Bishop Hill, most notably Carlin Maggie. The River Eden, one of the two primary rivers in Fife, has its source on the slopes of West Lomond. On the northern slopes of the Lomond Hills, two burns run down from the plateau in impressive gorges. These are the Maspie Burn and the Arraty Burn. Maspie Den has a path running along its length to an undercut waterfall at the top, which can be accessed just beyond Falkland House (approaching from the Falkland direction). Glen Vale with the Glen Burn, to the south of West Lomond, is equally impressive. Geology The hills are formed from early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks overlying Devonian sandstones and intruded by sills and volcanic plugs during late Carboniferous and Permian times. The lower ground to the north and west is formed from late Devonian rocks of the Glenvale Sandstone Formation traditionally ascribed to the Old Red Sandstone. Overlying this and forming the lower slopes of the scarp are the early Carboniferous sandstones of the Knox Pulpit and the Kinnesswood formations. Next in succession are the Pathhead Formation rocks which include cycles of sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, ironstones and limestone, formerly referred to as the Calciferous Sandstone Measures. These in turn are overlain by the varied cyclic sequences of the Lower Limestone Formation. The igneous rocks are relatively resistant to erosion and form the main scarp and two summits. A quartz-dolerite sill of probable Permo-Carboniferous age, forming a part of the Midland Valley Sill Complex intrudes the early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Lower Limestone Formation. The peaks of West Lomond and Green Hill are nepheline-basanite intrusions whilst East Lomond is a teschenite/olivine dolerite intrusion and vent agglomerate. A few faults affect the escarpment vertically offsetting the crags on either side. The Coul Fault is a northerly downthrowing fault aligned WNW-ESE running through the range and beneath Ballo Reservoir. Many lower areas are draped with glacial till from the last ice age. Easterly directed meltwater channels occur around the northeastern and southern margins. History The remains of Iron Age hill forts can be found around the summits of both East and West Lomond as well as at Maiden Castle, a grassy knoll that lies between the two. In more recent history, the Lomond Hills were mined for limestone, ore and lead, although there are no longer any working quarries there today. On the southwest slopes of East Lomond are the well preserved remains of a limekiln and quarry. Beneath the northern slopes of the escarpment lies Falkland Estate, an area of forest (now commercial plantation), where the kings of Scotland would have hunted whilst staying at nearby Falkland Palace. The present custodian of the palace is Ninian Crichton-Stuart, brother of the Marquess of Bute. Recreation and land management Due to the steep gradients and poor soil, the primary land uses on the Lomond Hills are sheep grazing and commercial forestry (predominantly on the steep north slopes) and water catchment. There are six reservoirs in the Lomond Hills that were originally constructed to supply water to the rapidly growing mining towns of west Fife. The Lomond Hills lie within the boundaries of Fife Regional Park, renamed the Lomond Hills Regional Park in 2003, and have their own ranger service who work principally with the landowners, estate managers and farmers on issues such as public access to help minimise the impact of recreational activities on their day-to-day business. The park covers approximately and is divided as follows: of land is in public ownership: belong to Fife Council and 620 are owned by Scottish Water. The balance of is privately owned. As a result of their accessibility and proximity to several major population centres, the hills are very popular with walkers. This has resulted in a considerable amount of footpath erosion, particularly on the steeper sections, that the ranger service and volunteer workers are taking measures to counteract. Both East and West Lomond can easily be climbed from Craigmead Car Park, which lies between the two at a height of around . Alternative routes exist from the Bunnet Stane, the village of Falkland and the car park at the masts, high on East Lomond. The views from both summits, due to their prominence, are magnificent, stretching from the Highlands to the Borders, with the sea in the east. As well as walking, there are a number of other recreational activities that take place in the Lomonds. East Lomond, due to the easy access from the high car park, is often used by paragliders on windy days. The Falkland Hill Race is held annually and begins at the fountain in the centre of Falkland village. The competitors must run (or in many cases walk) to the summit of East Lomond before returning to the fountain. The wooded northern slopes of East Lomond also boast a series of downhill mountainbike tracks. Gliders from the Scottish Gliding Centre at Portmoak between Bishop Hill and Loch Leven may be seen riding the thermals above the hills.

Amoretti is a sonnet cycle written by Edmund Spenser in the 16th century. The cycle describes his courtship and eventual marriage to Elizabeth Boyle. Amoretti was first published in 1595 in London by William Ponsonby. It was printed as part of a volume entitled Amoretti and Epithalamion. Written not long since by Edmunde Spenser. The volume included the sequence of 89 sonnets, along with a series of short poems called Anacreontics and Epithalamion, a public poetic celebration of marriage. Only six complete copies remain today, including one at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. and one at Oxford's Bodleian Library. \\"The volume memorializes Spenser's courtship of Elizabeth Boyle, a young, well-born Anglo- Irish woman, and the couple's wedding on June 11, 1594\\".Prescott, Anne Lake. \\"Spenser's Shorter Poems\\". The Cambridge Companion to Spenser. Ed. Andrew Hadfield. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 152 In the sonnets of Amoretti Spenser succeeds in \\"immortalizing the name of his bride to be ... by devices of word play\\".Blick, Fred, \\"Spenser's Amoretti and Elizabeth Boyle: Her Names Immortalized\\". Spenser Studies, New York, AMS Press, Inc., Vol.23, 2008, 309. In these cycles of sonnets, Spencer chronicles the progress of his love for his beloved, Elizabeth Boyle and then records his marriage to her. He even writes about his break up with wife (sonnet 34) in Amoretti. Amoretti has been largely overlooked and unappreciated by critics, who see it as inferior to other major Renaissance sonnet sequences in the Petrarchan tradition. In addition, it has been overshadowed by Spenser's other works, most notably The Faerie Queene, his epic allegorical masterpiece. C. S. Lewis, among the most important twentieth-century Spenser scholars, said that \\"Spenser was not one of the great sonneteers\\".Dasenbrock, Reed Way. \\"The Petrarchan Context of Spenser's Amoretti\\". PMLA, Vol. 100, No. 1. Jan, 1985. 38 However, other critics consider Spenser's sonnets to be innovative and to express a range of tones and emotions, and much more skillful and subtle than generally recognized. Petrarchan context The sonnets of Amoretti draw heavily on authors of the Petrarchan tradition, most obviously Torquato Tasso and Petrarch himself.Greene, Ronald. \\"Spenser and Contemporary Vernacular Poetry\\". The Cambridge Companion to Spenser. Ed. Andrew Hadfield. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 246 \\"In Amoretti, Spenser often uses the established topoi, for his sequence imitates in its own way the traditions of Petrarchan courtship and its associated Neoplatonic conceits\\". Apart from the general Neoplatonic conceit of spiritual love in opposition to physical love, he borrows specific images and metaphors, including those that portray the beloved or love itself as cruel tormenter. Many critics, in light of what they see as his overworking of old themes, view Spenser as being a less original and important sonneteer than contemporaries such as Shakespeare and Sir Philip Sidney. However, Spenser also revised the tradition that he was drawing from. Amoretti breaks with conventional love poetry in a number of ways. In most sonnet sequences in the Petrarchan tradition, the speaker yearns for a lover who is sexually unavailable. Not only is there a conflict between spiritual and physical love, but the love object is often already married; it is an adulterous love. \\"Spenser's innovation was to dedicate an entire sequence to a woman he could honorably win\\".Prescott, Anne Lake. \\"Spenser's Shorter Poems\\". The Cambridge Companion to Spenser. Ed. Andrew Hadfield. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 153 Elizabeth Boyle was an unmarried woman, and their love affair eventually ended in marriage. In addition, the Petrarchan tradition tends to be obsessed with the instability and discontinuity of the love situation. The speaker's feelings, thoughts, and motives continually change and shift. The love situation is fraught with egotism, conflict, and continual transformations within the speaker. These conflicts are never resolved, but continue on endlessly as the poet is continually frustrated by the rejection of his beloved or his inability to reconcile spiritual and physical love.Dasenbrock, Reed Way. \\"The Petrarchan Context of Spenser's Amoretti\\". PMLA, Vol. 100, No. 1. Jan, 1985. 38‚Äì9 While Petrarch finds some semblance of resolution in rejection of physical love and the subsequent death of his beloved, and Renaissance Petrarchism tends to ignore resolution and glorify the state of indeterminacy, Spenser finds his own unique solution. He eventually moves away from the constant transformation and self-absorption of the Petrarchan love situation, and towards the \\"peace and rest Spenser finds in the sacred world of marriage\\".Dasenbrock, Reed Way. \\"The Petrarchan Context of Spenser's Amoretti\\". PMLA, Vol. 100, No. 1. Jan, 1985. 46 He represents the Protestant conception of marriage, celebrating it as a sanctuary in which two people can find peace and rest in a mutual love covenant, in which spiritual and physical love can exist in harmony rather than as contraries.Dasenbrock, Reed Way. \\"The Petrarchan Context of Spenser's Amoretti\\". PMLA, Vol. 100, No. 1. Jan, 1985. 47 Liturgical sources The eighty-nine sonnets of the Amoretti were written to correspond with the scriptural readings prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer for specific dates in 1594. \\"Their conceits, themes, ideas, imagery, words, and sometimes their rhetorical structure consistently and successively match like particulars in these daily readings\\". Of the scriptural selections from a particular day, Spenser generally made use of the daily psalms or New Testament readings, often drawing upon the Gospel or Epistle for Sundays or feast days. The sonnets begin on January 23 and end on May 17, and appear to be written for the period leading up to Spenser's wedding to Elizabeth Boyle on June 11. Sonnet 22 corresponds to Ash Wednesday. Sonnet 68 corresponds to Easter Sunday, and the 46 intervening sonnets generally match up with the scripture readings prescribed for the 46 days of the feast of Lent in 1594. The Pre-Lenten and Lenten sonnets, while somewhat conventional on the surface, contain multi-layers of \\"humor, salaciousness, irony, parody, and ultimately travesty\\" beneath the surface. The Easter sonnets take on a more serious, devotional tone, climaxing with a celebration of marriage as a covenant of grace in which the betrothed overcome the difficulties of lust and passion and are united in grace and mutual love. The sequence of correspondences to daily scripture readings is not perfectly consecutive or uninterrupted, though. Sonnets 28‚Äì33 are an exception in that they bear no resemblance to the scripture readings from the days to which they could correspond. Larsen suggests that perhaps Spenser was not at home during the days 19‚Äì24 of February and had no access to scriptural resources because most bibles published at this time were not very portable. These sonnets tend to make more blatant and unoriginal use of Petrarchan conceits, and are more conventional and flat than the other poems. Sonnets 52‚Äì53 are not related to a scriptural source either. Larsen points out that Sonnet 53 suggests travel through its explicit descriptions of absence from the beloved: \\"from presence of my dearest deare exylde\\" and \\"So I her absens will my penaunce make\\". This seems to support his claim that lack of correspondence might be explained by Spenser's travels. With these exceptions, the correspondences run through Sonnet 75, which falls on April 7, the Sunday after Easter. Sonnets 76‚Äì89 correspond to the period from May 3 ‚Äì May 17, the beginning of a new cycle of second lessons at morning prayer through the day before the Vigil of the feast of Pentecost, which fell on May 19. These sonnets tend to draw even more heavily on daily scriptural readings than the preceding 75. For example, Sonnet 82, which was written for the feast of the Ascension is full of allusions to the Ascension, especially in its final couplet: \\"Whose loft argument uplifting me, / shall lift you vp vnto an high degree\\". The sonnets from the period before Pentecost are characterized by a painful and anxious sense of expectation. With the happiness of marriage in view, the speaker still suffers from the current state of separation. This feeling is appropriate to the liturgical season, in which Christians eagerly await unification with God's spirit, which he sends down to them on Pentecost. Sonnet 87 contains the line, \\"Thus I the time with expectation spend\\". When the sonnets of Amoretti are viewed in this liturgical context, one sees that Spenser's Petrarchan allusions and use of Petrarchan precedents cannot be reduced run-of-the-mill imitation. He adapts Petrarchan models and uses them to create connections to the day's scripture themes and imagery. In addition, he treats them with a smooth cadence and flow that tends to blur the distinctions within Petrarchan paradox rather than sharply separating the contraries. This correlates well with Spenser's goal of moving beyond the paradoxes and conflicts of love to the reconciliation and harmony embodied in marriage. \\"Spenser's working together of allusions and attitudes from both Petrarchist sources and scriptural loci intimates a poetic and a personal harmony, which in Amoretti becomes his ultimate preoccupation and goal‚Äù. This provides a sharp contrast to the focus of other Renaissance sonneteers, who tend to dwell on the indeterminacy and conflict of the lover's plight. Examining the underlying structure of the sequence and its religious parallels provides one key to appreciating the richness and complexity of Amoretti and establishing Spenser as one of the most important sixteenth-century sonneteers.

Among his siblings were brother Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale and sister Augusta Mary Lowther (wife of Hon. Gerard Noel, a son of Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough). His father, a longtime MP for Westmorland, was Father of the House of Commons from 1862 until his death in 1867. His paternal grandparents were William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and the former Lady Augusta Fane (eldest daughter of John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland and, his first wife, Augusta Bertie, a granddaughter of Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven). His maternal grandparents were Philip Sherard, 5th Earl of Harborough and the former Eleanor Monckton (second daughter and co-heiress of Col. Hon.

Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 After his return from Argentina, Lowther decided to build a new house in London. He bought land in South Kensington immediately south of Hyde Park, and there erected Lowther Lodge, an exemplar of Queen Anne Style architecture. The cost was partly defrayed by a bequest from his uncle William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale, who died unmarried, and without legitimate issue, in 1872 and was succeeded by Lowther's elder brother, Henry. In 1873, he was granted the style and precedence of the younger son of an Earl by Royal Warrant. He was a J.P. and a Deputy Lieutenant for Westmoreland and Cumberland and a J.P. for Bedfordshire and Suffolk. He was a director of the London and North Western Railway. In 1883, Lowther bought Ashe High House in Campsea Ashe, which had 31 bedrooms and dressing rooms, six bathrooms, six reception rooms and a library, from the Sheppard family who owned the estate since 1652. At the 1868 general election Lowther was elected Member of Parliament for Westmorland. He held the seat until 1885 when it was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. He was then elected MP for Appleby. He held the seat until 1892 when he was succeeded by Sir Joseph Savory, Bt. Personal life On 17 December 1853, Lowther was married to the Hon.

It was created by Jim Barnes in 1970, named after a daily newspaper column he wrote for an Iowa morning newspaper, and published by Avalon Hill in 1978, and new player cards were made for each new season until 1992. A licensing dispute with Major League Baseball led Avalon Hill to cease production of new cards. The game, however, came with instructions for players to create their own cards, so each year many people produce their own player cards, and some even sell them online. Due to the nature of the gameplay, the game was suitable for both solitary and head-to-head play. Game set The game set included player cards for most Major League players from the previous season, for all of the Major League Baseball teams, with position players and pitchers receiving different types of cards. In earlier sets, National League pitchers were assigned two cards‚Äîone for pitching and one for hitting‚Äîbut this was changed by 1988, when each team was assigned a single card representing all its pitchers. The set also included a rectangular game board, which resembled a baseball diamond. Around the diamond were arrayed spots to place the stack of cards for the batters and pitchers for each team. There were also several cards which allowed results from bunting, base stealing, extra bases, etc. to be determined (see below). To facilitate play, a large deck of 98 cards with random results was used. These were called Fast Action Cards (FACs), and were used instead of dice, which many similar games utilized. Each card had four results‚Äîtwo per side, one right-side up, one upside-down‚Äîwhich increased the possible number of results. The random numbers utilized an octal (base 8) system (using 1‚Äì8) and ran from 11‚Äì88, excluding numbers ending in 9 or 0 (i.e., 11‚Äì18, 21‚Äì28 ... 81‚Äì88), for a total of 64 numbers. The cards also contained further information used for gameplay (as detailed below). Additionally, the game included \\"out\\" sheets to enable the player to determine how outs were made during a particular at-bat (see below for more detail). Finally, tracking play was done with scorecards, similar to those used to track the results of a real Major League game, but with additional spaces for information necessary for the game. Player cards Batter cards contained the following information: * Name * Games by position * Error Rating, by position: E0 (best) through E10 * Throwing Rating: TA (best) through TC for catchers; T2 (worst) through T5 for outfielders * OBR (Baserunning Ability): A (best) through E * SP (Base-stealing Ability): A (best) through E * H&R; (Hit & Run Ability): 0 (worst) through 2 * CD (Clutch Defense Ability): 0 (worst) through 2 (pre-1988); 1 (worst) through 4 (1988 and on) * SAC (Bunting Ability): AA (best) through DD * INJ (Injury Rating): 0 (fewest games missed) through 8 * BD (Clutch Hitting Ability): 0 (worst) through 2 (pre-1988); individualized chart (1988 and on) * CHT (type of hitter): R, L, or S (right, left, or switch) plus N or P (normal or power), for six combinations (RN, RP, LN, LP, SN, SP) In addition, each batter would have ranges for the following results (proportionate to the batter's likelihood of achieving each result): * 1BF: Infield single * 1B7: Single to Left-field * 1B8: Single to Center-field * 1B9: Single to Right-field * 2B7: Double to Left-field * 2B8: Double to Center-field * 2B9: Double to Right-field * 3B8: Triple to Center-field * HR: Home run * K: Strikeout * W: Walk * HBP: Hit by pitch * Out: Out (consult chart for type) Pitcher cards contained the following information: * Name * Right or Left-handed * CD (Clutch Defense Ability): 0 (worst) through 2 (pre-1988); 1 (worst) through 4 (1988 and on) * INJ (Injury Rating): 0 (fewest games missed) through 8 * Games Pitched (total) * Error Rating: E0 (best) through E10 * PB Range (Skill, based mostly on ERA and wins): 2-5 (worst) through 2-9 * SR (Starting Reduction Value, measuring endurance): 0 (worst) through 20 * RR (Relief Reduction Value, measuring endurance): 0 (worst) through 20 * Appearances (Starting or Relief): number of games pitched in each instance In addition, each pitcher would have ranges for the following results (proportionate to the pitcher's likelihood of achieving each result): * 1BF: Infield single * 1B7: Single to Left-field * 1B8: Single to Center-field * 1B9: Single to Right-field * BK: Balk * K: Strikeout * W: Walk * PB: Passed ball * WP: Wild Pitch * Out: Out (consult chart for type) Originally the game was played with a set of dice and a yellow cardboard square which had result numbers 11‚Äì88 as well as results for clutch hitting, pitching, and defense arranged in a circle within the square. A metal spinner was affixed to the center of the square. Play was incorporated by rolling the dice to get a number between 2‚Äì12 which would determine if the play result would come from the pitchers card or the batters card. Then the spinner would be spun and the resulting number or other occurrence would give the play result. Basic gameplay Much like a real game, a game of Statis Pro Baseball would begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. This could be done with two players, each managing a different team, or with one player managing both. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicated which positions a players was allowed to play, and for how many games during a full season (e.g., a card might indicate a player could play 100 games at shortstop, 30 games at third base, and 10 games at catcher; similarly, a pitcher might indicate 10 games as a starter, and 25 as a reliever). Each at-bat was simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) would be drawn to determine a PB number, from 2 to 12. This would be compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card, which ranged from 2‚Äì5 for bad pitchers to 2‚Äì9 for great pitchers. If the PB number was \\"in range\\", a new FAC would be drawn, and the random number would be compared to the pitcher's card to determine the result of the at-bat. If the PB number was \\"out of range\\", the resulting random number would be compared to the batter's card to determine the result. For example, suppose a PB 2‚Äì9 pitcher is in the game, and that the PB number drawn is 6. This is \\"in range\\" (that is, between 2 and 9). Next, a random number is drawn‚Äîassume that number is 41. Looking at the hypothetical pitcher's card, we see that 41 is a strikeout. Thus, the at-bat is complete. If, however, the original PB number drawn was 10, it would be \\"out of range\\" and the random number would be compared to the batter's card. For this hypothetical batter, 41 is a home run. Using this example, it can be seen that the results depend a lot on whether the PB is \\"in\\" or \\"out\\" of range‚Äîsimulating whether the pitcher or the batter controls that at-bat. Thus, 2‚Äì9 pitchers will be more effective because they control more at-bats than 2‚Äì5 pitchers. Most of the results of any given PB and Random Number draw will be obvious to those who know baseball‚Äî1B, 2B, 3B, HR, K, BB are all familiar from boxscores. If, however, the random number falls into the Out range on either the batter or pitcher card, another FAC must be drawn to determine the type of out. Matching the CHT code with the FAC, the type of out could be determined. The outs used standard baseball scorekeeping (1=Pitcher, 2=Catcher ... 9=Right fielder), matched with codes unique to Statis Pro. These codes were then matched with the out charts to determine the exact result, based on number and position of the runners on base. The codes were as follows (using shortstop as an example): * F6 = Fly ball out to Shortstop (runners hold) * L6 = Line-drive out to shortstop (runners hold) * G6 = Groundball out to shortstop (double play, if applicable) * Gx6 = Groundball out to shortstop (lead runner forced out, if applicable) * G6A = Groundball out to shortstop (runners advance) Finally, if the code had an asterisk next to it, a final FAC would be drawn to check for error. This was done by comparing the error range on the FAC to the error rating of the fielder. For example, if the fielder's error rating was E2 and the error rating on the FAC was F8 to F10, then there would be no error. Clutch play In order to simulate \\"clutch\\" play, every player was assigned rating for BD (clutch hitting) and CD (clutch defense). These situations would be initiated by PB numbers on cards reading either BD or CD. BD would only apply if runners were on base. In that case, a second FAC would be drawn for the Random Number. For pre-1988 cards, each batter was assigned a BD rating of 0, 1, or 2. The BD rating plus the Random Number would be compared to the BD Chart on the game board, possibly resulting in an extra-base hit. For 1988 and later, each batter had a unique BD rating on his card‚Äîthe Random Number would be compared to the card, and the Chart could be ignored. If the Random Number fell outside the hit range on either the Chart or the card, play would resume with a new PB number. If CD was drawn as the PB number, a second FAC would be drawn to determine the position involved. Next, a third FAC would be drawn for a Random Number. Using the CD rating of position player (pre-1988, CD0 through CD2; 1988 and later, CD1 through CD4) and the Random Number, the CD chart would be consulted to determine the outcome of the play. Unusual plays Very occasionally, a PB number of Z would be drawn. Z indicated an unusual play, and would result in drawing of a second FAC for the Random Number, and then consulting the Unusual Play Chart. Random Numbers of 11‚Äì44 covered unusual plays such as ejections, catcher interference, rainouts, etc. Numbers 44‚Äì78 covered unlikely defensive plays, such as triple plays (although many were applicable only if specific combinations of runners were on base). Finally, numbers 81‚Äì88 indicated that an injury had occurred. This led to the drawing of another Random Number to determine the result of the play and who was injured. Then, using another Random Number matched with the player's INJ rating, the number of games to be missed could be determined (the fewer games missed in real-life, the fewer games missed in the simulation). Advanced gameplay Though an entire game could be played as described above, Statis Pro had a number of advanced features to simulate managerial/coaching decisions such as bunting, base-stealing, hitting-and-running, taking extra bases, playing the infield in, etc. In most cases, these would be done by the manager of the hitting team announcing a decision before the draw of a PB number for a new batter. In order to steal a base, for example, the manager would announce which runner was stealing. A FAC would be drawn, and the resulting Random Number would be compared to the base-stealing chart on the game board. The results varied based on whether the runner was stealing second, third, or home. Depending on the draw, it might be necessary to consult the runner's SP (base-stealing) rating. To sacrifice bunt, the process would be the same as for stealing, except that the sacrifice bunting chart would be used. The results would depend on the Random Number and the batter's Sac (sacrifice bunting) rating. From the pitching side, in order to simulate fatigue, every pitcher would be assigned a two Reduction Ratings (one for starting, one for relief). Each time the pitcher surrendered a hit, walk, run, wild pitch, or hit batsman, his rating would be reduced by one point (e.g., a walk and then a home run would be 4 points - one each for the walk and the hit, and then two for the runs scored). Once a pitcher's Reduction Rating reached zero, a PB number would no longer be drawn for each hitter‚Äîinstead, all at-bats would begin with a FAC Random Number draw being compared to the hitter's card. Because of this, it was usually advisable to remove a pitcher once his reduction hit zero (or even before). Online community Since Avalon Hill ceased production, many players have resorted to creating their own player cards, using the formulas provided in the game instructions. Some have even created new FACs to make the Random Number and PB Number draws more truly random. Others have created new rules in order to add further realism to the game (such as rules for foul balls, special rules for different ballparks, etc.).

It is understood to date at least to Ancient Greece. The most popular reason for docking dog breeds is to prevent injury to working dogs. In hunting dogs, the tail is docked to prevent it from getting cut up as the dog wags its tail in the brush. This is contested by a wide range of groupsWelfare Implications of Tail Docking-Dogs American Veterinary Medical Association and is sometimes considered a form of animal cruelty.Ear- Cropping and Tail-Docking People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals This has led to the practice being outlawed and made illegal throughout many countries, in some of which dogs are no longer bred for work, or used as working animals. For example, in United Kingdom tail docking was originally undertaken largely by dog breeders. However, in 1991, the UK government amended the Veterinary Surgeons Act (1966),Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 Office of Public Sector Information prohibiting the docking of dogs' tails by lay persons from 1 July 1993.Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 (Schedule 3 Amendment) Order 1991 Office of Public Sector Information Only veterinary surgeons were, by law, allowed to dock. However, following the passage of the law, the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in November 1992, ruled docking to be unethical, \\"unless for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons\\". The requirement in which the Royal College considers prophylactic docking to be acceptable are so strict as to make the routine docking of puppies by veterinary surgeons extremely difficult. Vets who continue to dock risk disciplinary action, and can be removed from the professional register. Those found guilty of unlawful docking would face a fine of up to ¬£20,000, up to 51 weeks imprisonment or both. They can only dock the tail of \\"working\\" dogs (in some specific cases) - e.g. hunting dogs that work in areas thick in brambles and heavy vegetation where the dog's tail can get caught and cause injury to the dog. Docking was banned in England and Wales by the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and in Scotland by the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. In 1987 the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals, established by Council of Europe, prohibited docking for non-medical reasons, though signatory countries are free to opt out of this provision, and almost half of them have done so. Norway completely banned the practice in 1987. Other countries where docking is banned include Australia and the United Kingdom.

For example, a draft horse used for hauling large loads might have had its tail docked to prevent it from becoming entangled in tow ropes, farm machinery, or harness; without docking, it could be dangerous to the horse, painful if the tail were tangled, and inconvenient to the owner to tie up the horse's tail for every use. In modern use, the term usually does not refer to tail amputation as it does with some dog breeds. However, historically, docking was performed on some horses, often as foals. The practice has been banned in some nations, but is still seen on some show and working draft horses in some places, and is practiced at some PMU operations. \\"Tail Docking in Heavy Horses.\\" Livestock Welfare INSIGHTS Issue 4 - Jun 2003 web page accessed September 1, 2008 In modern times, the term \\"docked\\" or \\"docking\\" in reference to the tail of a horse generally refers to the practice of cutting the hair of the tail skirt very short, just past the end of the natural dock of the tail. In particular, the tail is often cut short to keep it from being tangled in a harness. Cattle Tail docking of dairy cows is prevalent in some regions. Some anecdotal reports have suggested that such docking may reduce SCC (somatic cell counts in milk) and occurrence of mastitis. However, a study examining such issues found no significant effect of docking on SCC or mastitis frequency or on four measures of cow cleanliness.Tucker, C. B., D. Fraser and D. M. Weary. 2001. Tail docking dairy cattle: effects on cow cleanliness and udder health. J. Dairy Sci. 84: 84-87. Although it has been suggested that leptospirosis among dairy farm workers might be reduced by docking cows' tails, a study found that milkers' leptospiral titers were not related to tail docking.Stull, C. L., M. A. Payne, S. L. Berry and P. J. Hullinger. 2002. Evaluation of the scientific justification for tail docking in dairy cattle. J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc. 220: 1298-1303. The American Veterinary Medical Association opposes \\"routine tail docking of cattle.\\" Similarly, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association opposes docking tails of dairy cattle. Cattle on large Australian cattle stations often have the tail brush (not the dock) cut shorter (banged) before their release; this \\"bang-tail muster\\" indicates those having been counted, treated, their current pregnancy status determined, etc. Tail docking in the dairy industry is prohibited in Denmark, Germany, Scotland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and some Australian states, as well as California, Ohio, and Rhode Island. Several large organizations within the dairy industry are against tail docking because of the lack of scientific evidence supporting claims benefiting the practice. Scientific studies have demonstrated that there are numerous animal welfare issues with this practice (such as distress, pain, increased activity in pain receptors in the tail stump, abnormal growths of nerve fibers, sensitivity to heat and cold, and clostridial diseases). Fortunately, there is an effective and humane alternative to tail docking, which is switch trimming. Pigs In the case of domestic pigs, where commercially raised animals are kept in close quarters, tail docking is performed to prevent injury or to prevent animals from chewing or biting each other's tails.

A. Epstein, pp. 21, 31 and the midrash closes with the words \\"'ad kan me-divrei R. Pinchas ben Yair.\\" No other authors are named. Midrash Tadshe must not be confused with another baraita bearing the title Baraita de-Rabbi b. Yair, which deals with gradations of virtues, the highest of which causes its possessor to share in the holy spirit.Compare So·π≠ah 49a, and parallels; see Otzar Midrashim: Baraita of Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair Contents Midrash Tadshe is unusual in several respects, compared to other midrashim. Although written in pure Hebrew, it contains numerous expressions which are not found elsewhere, such as ◊ó◊í ◊î◊¢◊ï◊û◊® and ◊ó◊í ◊î◊©◊ï◊§◊®◊ï◊™ and ◊õ◊õ◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊©◊®◊ï◊¢◊ô◊ù (= \\"planets,\\" p. 19). The structure of the midrash is very loose. The midrash is generally symbolic in tendency, and it plays much on groups of numbers. Section 2 contains a symbolization of the Tabernacle, and, according to A. Epstein, the central idea of the midrash is the theory of three worlds ‚Äî earth, man, and the Tabernacle. Section 10 contains a mystical explanation of the numbers mentioned in connection with the offerings of the princes (Numbers 7:12-89). Combinations and parallelisms based on the number ten are found in sections 5 and 15; on seven, in 6, 11, and 20; on six, in 20; on five, in 7; on four, in 20; on three, in 12, 18, etc. Desultory expositions of Genesis 2:17; 3:3, 14 et seq.; Exodus 7:12 et seq., 83 et seq.; Leviticus 13:2, 14:34; Lamentations 1:1 et seq.; Numbers 4:3, 27:7; and Deut. 32:12, are contained in sections 7, 10, 17, 20, 21, and 22. = Analogies with the Book of Jubilees = Especially noteworthy is section 8, on \\"the ages of the pious,\\" the Patriarchs, the Matriarchs, and the twelve sons of Jacob, giving also the dates of their births. In this list the months are not designated as Nisan, etc., but as \\"the first,\\" \\"the second,\\" etc. The dates for Zebulun and Benjamin are lacking in the present text, but are given in a citation by Ba·∏•ya and in Yalkut Shimoni, where, however, the months are named and not numbered. The length of life ascribed to the sons of Jacob agrees with that given in Seder Olam Zutta, but only the Book of Jubilees gives the days and months of their births, and even it does not state the length of their lives.Compare Jubilees 28 and 32, where, however, some dates differ from those given in the midrash On the other hand, section 6 of Midrash Tadshe is in entire agreement with Jubilees (2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 23) in its statement that 22 varieties of things were created in the world‚Äîseven on the first day; one on the second; four on the third; three on the fourth; three on the fifth; and four on the sixth‚Äîand that these 22 varieties correspond to the 22 generations from Adam to Jacob (and to the 22 letters of the alphabet). Epstein has drawn attention to other striking analogies between this midrash and the Book of Jubilees, especially to the theory of R' Pinchas ben Yair (p. 31) that Adam was created in the first week, and that Eve was formed in the second week, from his rib; this serving as the foundation for the rule of purification given in Lev. 12:2 et seq., with which Jubilees 3:8 can be compared. On these grounds, Epstein advances the hypothesis that in this and many other passages the author of the Midrash Tadshe used the Book of Jubilees, which existed at that time in Hebrew and was much larger in scope than at present, and was ascribed, \\"on account of its Essenic tendency,\\" to R' Pinchas, who was famous for his great piety. However, it is unlikely that the present Book of Jubilees is incomplete, and a much more plausible view of Epstein's is that which regards the Midrash Tadshe as the work of Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan. Later usage Either due to its beginning, or for some other reason, R' Pinchas ben Yair was regarded as the author of this midrash, and Numbers Rabbah 13:10 and 14:12,18 contain excerpts from the midrash in the name of R' Pinchas ben Yair. Yalkut Shimoni excerpted several passages from it, and it has been cited by various authors. The midrash has been edited according to manuscript sources by Adolf JellinekB. H. 3:164-193 and by A. Epstein.Beitr√§ge zur J√ºdischen Alterthumskunde, Vienna, 1887 References = Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography = *Zunz, G. V. p. 580; *Rab Pe'alim, pp. 114 et seq.; *Adolf Jellinek, B.

The tropical evergreen jungle has been damaged by hurricanes such as Hurricane Hattie in 1961, and fires caused by occasional lightning. These environmental factors have caused the ecosystem to become stunted. Along with averages of 100 inches of rainfall per year, Victoria peak is often windswept and cloud covered and the soil is poor as the various surrounding vegetation takes up all of the nutrients. The mountain is found covered with non-calcareous rock, along with the growth of many different plant species.  Flora  Many of the plants that thrive in this diverse forest are used for medicinal practices, food, or even as guides and trail markers ensuring the Maya hunters do not become lost in the forest.Shapiro, M.

Frequent species of plants that are characteristic to Victoria Peak and the Cockscomb range are Clusia sp. and Myrica cerifera, two plants species which form thick stands that average about 1-2 m (3-6 ft) tall. Shrubs such as these are very often accompanied by ‚Äúbeard lichen‚Äù growing amongst the branches. Bromeliads and orchids are also numerous, such as the orange flowering orchid, Epidendrum ibaguense or the scarlet orchid, also known as dragon's tongue.Epidendrum ibaguense, or the fiery-coloured orchid, is a rare species of orchid that only grows at higher elevations. One of the other more common plant species seen is the hot lips bush, it is most frequently spotted along the trail edges and is characterized by its ‚Äòpouting‚Äô red flower.

The chain of stores was founded in 1948 but could trace its history as far back as 1922 or 1908, when the original lumber company that preceded it was founded. At its peak Channel operated stores in nine states, and did business in the Philadelphia and New York metropolitan areas. In August 1994 Channel was bought by venture capital firm Eos Partners L.P. and merged with competitor Rickel, ceasing to exist.  History  A 1975 New York Times profile traced the company's origins to a lumber business started in Newark in 1922 by two Russian Jewish Americans, Abraham Levy and Morris Charin (1887‚Äì1963).(\\"Channel Lumber Co., Belleville, lumber, $125,000; Morris Charin, Max Adelman, Abraham Levy, Newark.\\") A 1990 article in the same publication, and other company releases, however, have put the founding date at 1908. In any event, Louis L. Slater (1913‚Äì1987), son-in-law of Levy, opened the first retail outlet in Newark, New Jersey in 1948. In 1963, it was reported that Channel Lumber had seven locations, all in New Jersey.(\\"Morris Charin, founder and president of the Channel Lumber Company, which operates a chain of seven retail outlets in this state, died Thursday in Miami, Fla. He was 76 years old....:\\") By late 1975, the chain had 24 locations, 22 of which were in New Jersey. W. R. Grace and Company purchased the company from the Slater family in 1977 for $19 million. By 1979, the company had expanded to over 70 locations, moving beyond New Jersey and Pennsylvania to enter New York, Connecticut, and Delaware in 1978, and Maryland and Massachusetts in 1979. In 1986, Channel's executives bought the company through a leveraged buyout. The purchase included a total of 202 retail locations in 20 states, including home centers under W.R. Grace located in the southeast, among them \\"Handy City\\" and Handy Dan. By 1990, the chain had grown to 89 Channel outlets in nine states, but in early 1991, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and announced a plan to close 34 of 86 stores, mostly in the Baltimore-Washington and New England markets. It emerged from bankruptcy in March 1992. In 1994, Channel and its competitor Rickel were bought by a venture capital firm, which merged the operations of the two chains under the Rickel name. At that point in time, it had 60 locations, and its 1993 sales topped $300 million. Nearly all the Channel stores were converted into Rickel locations, except for one location that was operated in proximity to a Rickel store.

Beginning 20 December 2003 and ending 20 March 2013, the 317th AG deployed for 3,378 continuous days in service to the United States at home and abroad. On 25 July 2013, the 317 AG received its 28th and final Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules, giving the Group the distinction of being the largest C-130J unit in the world. In May 2014, crews and planes of the group deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, where they formed the 75th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, supporting Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Horn of Africa. During the deployment crews supported medical evacuations, disaster relief, humanitarian and airdrop operations. Operations included movement of the East Africa Response Force to forward positions. On 19 February 2015, airmen of the 317th who had been deployed to Dakar, Senagal as part of Operation United Assistance, the US military support to the Agency for International Development in its response to contain the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa. The return of these airmen marked the first time since September 2013 that the entire group was together at its home station. At Dakar, the airmen had served as part of the 787th Air Expeditionary Squadron. In July 2017, the unit was upgraded to wing status with the activation of the 317th Airlift Wing and concurrent establishment of the 317th Operations Group and 317th Maintenance Group.

The home, also known as the Cupola House, stood unoccupied on Grant Highway as of January 2007. In recent years the home had been classified by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois (LPCI) as one of the state's threatened landmarks. In 2003 the property was listed on LPCI's \\"top ten most endangered\\" list.Statewide Endangered Archive: 1995-2005 , Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois, Official site, Retrieved Jan. 2007.

In 2003 the house was listed as a landmark by the city of Marengo.Existing Landmarks in Marengo, Illinois , (PDF), Marengo Historical Preservation Commission, City of Marengo. Architecture The home is a distinctive example of Italianate architecture. The home's namesake as Cupola House comes from the octagonal cupola on its roof which provides ventilation and it is thought served as a lookout tower during the Civil War. the first floor has two back bedrooms believed to have been servant's quarters at one time. Upstairs, on the second floor, there are six bedrooms, a long hallway, a back staircase and bathroom.Cupola House , All about Marengo, City of Marengo, Official site. History The Hibbard House has a fairly illustrious history, as houses go. Construction began in 1846 at the behest of Charles Hibbard, in 1847 the home was complete and the Hibbard's moved in. The home was constructed as an exact replica of Hibbard's childhood home and contains 14 rooms. Construction cost somewhere around $16,000. The property that the home is on was purchased as a plot from Christopher Sponable. Hibbard came to Marengo by way of Charleston, South Carolina. He was one of Marengo's first storekeepers and was a known horticulturalist who was renowned for his produce. During the Civil War it is thought that the home was used as a safe stop for runaway slaves. The cupola played a key role in that if it was safe to stop, for food and lodging, a light would be hung in the cupola window. The home also contained a secret, underground room in the yard, it had a hidden entrance near the front porch. Hibbard died in Lawson, Missouri in 1872 and by 1874 the home was owned by Joseph Dietz who ran a machine shop in Marengo around 1877. Dietz married Caroline Sponable, the first white child to be born in Seneca Township. Dietz owned the home until 1894 when records show that A.H. (C.H or H.L.) Hale bought the home and held it until 1950. A local teacher, Jane Stanford, purchased the home in 1950 and owned it until 1955. Stanford was well known as an educator and community leader. Mr. and Mrs. Francis (Mary) Muzzy owned the home from 1956 to 1980. Jane Stanford's niece, Mary Stanford Muzzy (daughter of Charles Stanford, Jane's brother) and her husband purchased the home from her aunt's estate. Mary S. Muzzy Neal has owned the home since 1980. Mary Susan Neal lives in California and created a life there since before 1972 when she was admitted the state bar of California as an attorney.

The school was founded in 1885 and is the oldest operating publicly funded high school in the province. The school has a student population of 940 and 78 faculty members. EDHS feeder schools are Essex Public School, Colchester North Public School and Gosfield North Public Schools. History In 1885, Dr. James Brien proposed and received strong support for the establishment of a new High School in Essex Centre. On March 14, 1885 the first meeting of the School Board took place at Peck's Hall led by James Naylor as Chairman; and J.S. Laird, S.G. Thomas, C.E. Jones, John Milne, and W.H. Russell. Classes started August 31 in the old church behind the railroad station on Medora Avenue, which had been used by the Methodist Episcopal Church. There were 18 students and two teachers in the first year. Captain Albert Jones offered part of Lot 284 consisting of 3 acres of his land for the building site for the new school which cost $10,000.00. It was a two- storey red brick structure measuring 64' √ó 67', with three classrooms on both floors, a basement, and an attic all heated with wood stoves. Essex High School officially opened in 1888, accommodating 200 students. In 1889, the Lyceum, a Literary Society was organized and the Argus (the first school magazine) began. Since attendance reached 59 students, a third teacher was hired. High School Cadets were first organized in 1898. By 1904, Essex High School was highly acclaimed for its well equipped gym. In 1920, an addition to the school costing $5,000.00 was built and there were six teachers on staff A fire on Tuesday, February 14, 1921 destroyed the school. All that was saved were the guns and uniforms of the cadets. All records, science and chemistry apparati and books were burned. Essex Free Press article February 18, 1921 > \\"The fire had started about 7:45 in the old furnace room.

The practice at that time was to oil the wood floors, and so the fire that started in the furnace room spread quickly. The school was destroyed in only an hour's time. People came from all over the county to see the remains of the school. In fact, the Electric railway ran a car from Kingsville to Essex so Kingsville students could see the ruins. Since Essex High School had been the first school built outside of Windsor, many came from as far away as Leamington. The Monday following the fire, Orange Hall (the basement of the Library) and one classroom at the public school were used to continue classes for its 160 students. Orange Hall also served as the Presbyterian Sunday School. Despite inconveniences, education continued in this state until the new school was built. The new school was built at a cost of $85,000.00. It was formally opened by the Warden of the County on September 5, 1922.Essex Free Press ArchivesEssex District High School Centennial 1885‚Äì1985 year book Construction began on a new high school in June 2012 and was completed over four phases to allow the school to remain open. Construction was completed in July 2015 at cost over $18,500,000.00. A portion of the original facade still stands along the southeast corner of the building facing Talbot St. North. This portion of the building is a part of the Essex Recreation Complex which was not included in the construction project.

It is the second novel in the Finder‚Äôs Stone Trilogy which is set within the world of the Forgotten Realms. This novel received 4 stars from OtherRealms. The novel focuses on a clumsy but well- meaning young nobleman whose designs on a return to normal town life are interrupted when he stumbles into an ancestral vendetta and rediscovers a family legacy.  Plot introduction  The Wyvernspurs are a noble family within the Kingdom of Cormyr and the provincial town of Immersea has been their ancestral residence. The novel centers around Giogioni ‚ÄúGiogi‚Äù Wyvernspur and begins with his homecoming after a lengthy ten-month absence. With billing as a sequel to Azure Bonds, it nonetheless includes the participation of only one main character from the preceding novel. Giogi himself did play a role in events of the first novel but was effectively only a recurring supporting character. Unlike its predecessor, the events of the novel take place over the span of only a few days and occur entirely within a single locale. Additionally, the novel contains a strong romantic component. Song of the Saurials is the third book in the Finders Stone Trilogy. Plot summary Most of the novel revolves around Giogi's efforts to locate and recover an important family heirloom that goes missing just as he is returning to Immersea. The lost heirloom is an artifact from which they take their family name; the wyvern's spur, and the chief initial motivation for its recovery is the omen that the spur's loss will trigger family misfortune. This is underscored when an elder family member, the wizard Drone, is discovered dead and a twisted mage named Flattery makes his presence known. Giogi is aided in his efforts by Olive Ruskettle, a female halfling, and a female apprentice mage named Cat. As the story progresses it is revealed that Cat is actually Flattery's agent (under duress) and that Flattery himself is an un- aging creation of a forgotten ancestor named Finder Wyvernspur. Flattery, for reasons left vague, possesses an intense hatred of anything connected with Finder's legacy including his descendants. Eventually, Giogi convinces Cat to leave Flattery and the two fall in love. Giogi relearns much of the repressed history of his family and uses this knowledge to defeat Flattery and restore the family's good heritage. = The Wyvern's spur = The wyvern's spur is literally a mummified ‚Äúwyvern's spur‚Äù (a talon). It is described once by Giogi as being ‚Äúno larger than a zucchini and uglier than a three-week-old sausage.‚Äù The spur was bestowed generations earlier to Paton, the founder of the family line, by a grateful Wyvern whose spirit then remained as an entity known as the Guardian. In recent years the spur has come to be known more as a family heirloom than its qualities as a magical artifact The spur confers the ability to transform into a large wyvern as well as immunity to magic. It can only be wielded by a member of the Wyvernspur line and even then its powers can only be harnessed by a chosen member. A chosen or ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù is designated by the Guardian roughly once each generation. Characters in The Wyvern's Spur ;Giogioni Wyvernspur :Giogi, as he is commonly known, is a simple but good natured young nobleman who is often varyingly dismissed or derided by his peers due to his propensity for ineptitude. Giogi deviates from a hereditary family trait in that, unlike other Wyvernspur menfolk who share extreme physical resemblance with one another, his looks are distinctly unique. ;Olive Ruskettle :Olive is a female halfling who is coincidentally herself in Immersea with a companion named Jade, who bears a near identical physical resemblance to the swordswoman Alias. Shortly thereafter Jade is killed by Flattery. Olive, motivated by both vengeance and circumstance, begins assisting Giogi in his efforts using special insight gleaned from her related experiences in a recent past adventure. ;Cat :A fledgling female wizard. Cat is initially in the abusive service of the more powerful Flattery. She bears a near identical physical resemblance to the swordswoman Alias. ;Flattery :A powerful mage who launches an assault against the Wyvernspur clan. He is motivated in part by the desire for the wyvern's spur as well as retribution for an ancient vendetta. Reception * A reviewer on OtherRealms, the winner of the 1989 Hugo for Best Fanzine, stated that Wyvern's Spur was an improvement over the first novel of the Finder's Stone trilogy, Azure Bonds. The reviewer concluded that due to improved plotting and developments, this book rated 4 stars, as compared to the three stars given to Azure Bonds. * A reviewer on Let's Read TSR! pointed out the strong similarity between this book, featuring a \\"foppish, foolish aristocrat with more money that sense... and his uncannily competent valet\\", with any Jeeves & Wooster story by P.G. Wodehouse; but the reviewer admitted that \\"this very unoriginality makes it original: this may be the first of the Forgotten Realms books we‚Äôve looked at so far which veers away from the standard 'heroic fantasy' template. As a pastiche of the works of Wodehouse, it straddles the line between traditional heroic fantasy and the 'fantasy of manners', a genre which emphasizes the social aspects of the fantasy world over the action and questing and all that.\\" The reviewer did think there were some issues with occasional bits of awkward writing, but found the pacing quite good. The reviewer thought the strongest part of the book was that \\"Novak and Grubb have done a good job of making the world feel like a living place, rather than just a stage where the characters play their parts.\\" The reviewer concluded by giving the book an A grade. Cover artwork The cover artist Clyde Caldwell did the cover for this novel as well as the first book of the trilogy, Azure Bonds. There is an in-joke referencing Clyde's preferred style and subject matter. In particular when the character Olive, on examining a statuette, says ‚Äú‚Ä¶that‚Äôs an original Cledwyll. Overly endowed and scantily clad. Yes definitely a Cledwyll.‚Äù References Category:1990 American novels Category:Forgotten Realms novels Category:Novels by Jeff Grubb ","title":"The Wyvern's Spur"},{"id":"8882767","text":"Do Not Bend is the third solo album by British pop musician and songwriter Eric Stewart, a founding member of 10cc.

This javelin was used by the velites for skirmishing purposes, unlike the heavier pilum, which was used by the hastati and principes for weakening the enemy before advancing into close combat. The shafts were about long, substantially shorter than the pilum, and the point measured about long. The verutum had either an iron shank like the pilum or a tapering metal head. It was sometimes thrown with the aid of a throwing strap, or amentum. The verutum was adopted from the Samnites and the Volsci. During the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Roman light infantry (velites) would carry seven veruta into combat. It proved to be quite an effective weapon, even against war elephants as proven in the battle of Zama. In the late 2nd century BC, the verutum was taken out of service along with the veles, but the javelin was taken back into the legionary arsenal during the Late Empire.

Educated at Clifton College,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. pp291/2: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 he was commissioned into the Scots Guards as a second lieutenant on 29 December 1888, promoted to lieutenant on 13 April 1892, and to captain on 24 June 1899. When the Second Boer War broke out in October 1899, the 1st battalion of the Scots Guards departed Ireland for South Africa to join up with the 1st Guards Brigade, with Lowther appointed adjutant. They reached that country in November, and immediately saw action in the battles of Belmont and Modder River, both British victories, though at a heavy cost in British life. In December, the battalion was present at the Battle of Magersfontein, and the following year took part in the march to take the Boer capitals of Bloemfontein and Pretoria. After taking the latter city, the 1st Guards Brigade took part in the Battle of Diamond Hill (June 1900), and in the last large scale battle of the war at Bergendal in August 1900. The war then became a guerrilla war, and Lowther was on 20 July 1901 appointed to a staff position as Staff Captain for Intelligence. For his service in the war, Lowther received the Queen's South Africa Medal, was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO),Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 and was noted for future staff employment. After the war had ended, Lowther was back as a regular officer in the 1st battalion of his regiment in September 1902, but three months later was appointed a Brigade Major, Foot Guards brigade in the 1st Army Corps on 3 December 1902.

The term's use dates back to at least the 1830s, when Mary Russell Mitford wrote of \\"nothing so easy as catching a heart on the rebound\\".Rebound, n. (and adj.). Oxford English Dictionary. Third edition, July 2010; online version November 2010. Accessed 7 January 2011. The term may also refer to a romantic relationship that a person has during the rebound period, or to the partner in such a relationship. When a serious relationship ends badly, these partners suffer from complex emotional stresses of detachment. This in combination with the need to move forward leads previous partners to have uncommitted relations called rebounds. Common confusion exists around the extended duration of rebound periods, simply put, our critical core values and love are still gravitated and polarized towards a particular person (i.e. our previous partner) thereby preventing the overall development and accurate assessment of feelings for others during this period of time (the rebound) because true love requires complete mental-emotional commitment. Someone who is \\"on the rebound,\\" or recently out of a serious dating relationship, is popularly believed to be psychologically incapable of making reasonable decisions regarding suitable partners due to emotional neediness, lingering feelings towards the old partner, or unresolved problems from the previous relationship. Rebound relationships are believed to be short-lived due to one partner's emotional instability and desire to distract themselves from a painful break up. Those emerging from serious relationships are often advised to avoid serious dating until their tumultuous emotions have calmed.

Early and later life  Chinese ship in harbor of Thomsen's family business circa 1898 Thomsen was born in 1915 into a wealthy American family in Seattle. His namesake was after his grandfather a powerful Washington businessman.

As detailed in his memoirs, his relationship with his father was extremely strained, with Thomsen describing the man as \\"tyrannical.\\" During World War II, Thomsen served as a B-17 Flying Fortress bombardier in the Eighth Air Force. At age 44 he was working as a farmer in California when he decided to join the Peace Corps. In 1964, at 48 years old, Thomsen came to Ecuador as one of the first volunteers of the Peace Corps . Upon arrival, and after many wanderings, he was assigned on condition of agricultural expert to the small fishing town of Green River, north of the province of Esmeraldas . Thomsen lived for four years in that village, and a total of 35 years in Ecuador. After serving as a volunteer for four years, he remained in Ecuador. He died in 1991 of cholera.  Writings  During his time in Ecuador, Thomsen wrote and published four books of memories and impressions, most of them on Ecuador and experience with poverty. =Living Poor: a Peace Corps Chronicle= The first of these books, Living Poor: a Peace Corps Chronicle originally appeared as a series of vignettes in the San Francisco Chronicle, in its Sunday edition. By 1968, these texts were collected, edited and appeared in the form of a printed book by University of Washington Press. From then until the present, the book has remained in print continuously, with editions in the US, UK, Germany and more recently France. In the US alone the book has sold over a hundred thousand copies. It was officially published in 1969 and is ranked as one of the best Peace Corps memoirs ever written.\\"Moritz Thomsen (Review of The Saddest Pleasure: A Journey on Two Rivers) by Dan Webster, The Spokesman Review, November 9, 2003. =Other works= Thomsen published a second book about his experience in Ecuador's agriculture in 1978: The Farm on the River of Emeralds and then, in 1989 and 1990 his two recent texts: The Saddest Pleasure: a Journey on Two Rivers , about his experiences in Ecuador and in a series of trips to Brazil. It won a 1991 Governor's Writers Award (now the Washington State Book Awards). In his introduction to The Best Travel Writing, 2005, author Tom Miller writes that The Saddest Pleasure: A Journey on Two Rivers \\"embodies some of the very finest elements of travel literature: constant doubt, a meddlesome nature, and a disregard for nationalism.\\"The Best Travel Writing 2005, pp. xvii-xviii. My Two Wars (published posthumously) looks at both his \\"tempestuous\\" relationship with his father and his experiences as a World War II bombardier.

Thomsen received a number of literary awards, including the Washington State Book Award in 1991 and the Paul Cowan Award 1989. Since 1992, an organization named Peace Corps Writers awards an annual prize for the best short written about the experience of the body Peace named Moritz Thomsen Peace Corps Experience Award. Several scholarly studies affirm and confirm the idea, widespread among a wide group of readers, that Moritz Thomsen is one of the most important but least known of the second part of the twentieth century American writers. Miller calls Thomsen \\"one of the great American expatriate writers of the twentieth century\\" and describes him as \\"A soft-hearted cuss, a man of almost insufferable integrity, a lousy farmer and a terrific writer.\\" He describes Thomsen's style as one that \\"pledged allegiance to nothing except his station as an expatriate. And as an expat he was free to judge us all, an undertaking he finessed with acute observations, self-deprecation, and a flavorful frame of reference that ranged from a Tchaikovsky symphony to a Sealy Posturpedic mattress.\\" Thomsen was a descendant of the powerful Thomsen family of Washington. His grandfather, Mortiz Thomsen his namesake, was a renowned adventurer. John D. Rockefeller hailed him in a journal article as one of the 12 Men Who Shaped the West and a biography of his life Wind in His Sails chronicled his adventures. His grandfather started the first flour mill on the west coast in the 1800s. It is estimated that his father, Charles Thomsen would have been a billionaire in modern day with inflation accounted for. Thomsen was also of related to the fellow Danish Jensen family of Minnesota.  Worldview  Thomsen's worldview is reflected in a statement he once made: \\"Living Poor is like being sentenced to exist in a stormy sea in a battered canoe, requiring all your strength simply to keep afloat; there is never any question of reaching a destination. True poverty is a state of perpetual crisis, and one wave just a little bigger or coming from an unexpected direction can and usually does wreck things.\\"  Bibliography  =Selected works= * Living Poor: A Peace Corps Chronicle (1969; new edition by Eland in 2011) * The Farm on the River of Emeralds (1978) * The Saddest Pleasure: A Journey on Two Rivers (1990) * My Two Wars (1996) (published posthumously) * Bad News from a Black Coast (2018)'' References External links * Article at SpokesmanReview.com * Article at PeaceCorpsWriters.org Category:Peace Corps volunteers Category:1915 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century American writers Category:20th-century American male writers ","title":"Moritz Thomsen"},{"id":"8882965","text":"Cleveland Line may refer to: *Cleveland railway line, a suburban railway line from Brisbane to Cleveland in Queensland, Australia *Cleveland Line (Norfolk Southern), running from Rochester, Pennsylvania, to Cleveland, Ohio, along a former Pennsylvania Railroad line ","title":"Cleveland Line"},{"id":"8883007","text":"The palmar carpal branch of ulnar artery (volar carpal branch) is a small vessel which crosses the front of the carpus beneath the tendons of the Flexor digitorum profundus, and anastomoses with the corresponding branch of the radial artery.

It was formerly widespread in Scandinavia, but is today played mainly in Estonia, particularly among that nation's Swedish community. It is similar to the Finnish jouhikko and the Welsh crwth. The instrument is still known in Finland. The name talharpa probably comes from tagel - horsehair - from which the strings were made.Andersson, Otto (1930). The Bowed Harp.

She was the largest in the world when launched February 28, 1931, and remains, with a length of 136 m (446 ft), one of the world‚Äôs longest. Although owned by the government of Turkey, she had been briefly leased out to Turkish businessman Kahraman Sadƒ±koƒülu. However, upon orders of the Turkish Government her lease was terminated and she reverted to the Turkish State. The first time she was used again for an official reception was in March 2015. History Named for an African swan living in the Indian Ocean, the ship was designed by Gibbs & Cox for American heiress Emily Roebling Cadwalader, granddaughter of John A. Roebling, engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge. Savarona was the 5th and final vessel built for Mrs. Cadwalader and her husband Richard M. Cadwalader. Their second yacht, Sequoia II, was launched October 27, 1925 and served as a U.S. presidential yacht from 1931 until 1977. The former U.S. presidential yacht Sequoia is now owned by Equator Capital Group and being restored at French & Webb in Belfast Maine. Savarona was built by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, Germany at a cost of about $4 million ($57 million in 2010 dollars). Equipped with Sperry gyro-stabilizers, she was described in 1949 by Jane's Fighting Ships as \\"probably the most sumptuously fitted yacht afloat.\\" In 1933, the ship was used as a film set while on the North Sea off the German coast. It appeared prominently in the German science-fiction film Gold, starring Hans Albers and Brigitte Helm. The movie premiered in 1934. In 1938, the Turkish government acquired the yacht and gifted to ailing leader Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, who spent only six weeks aboard before dying a few months later. Throughout World War II, the ship lay idle in Kanlƒ±ca Bay on the Bosporus. In 1951, she was converted to the training ship G√ºne≈ü Dil (English: Sun Language) and during the next years sailed to many countries. In October 1979, the ship was gutted by fire at the Turkish Naval Academy off Heybeliada Island in the Sea of Marmara. She lay virtually abandoned for ten years. In 1989, she was chartered for 49 years by Turkish businessman Kahraman Sadƒ±koƒülu. Over three years, his firm completely refurbished her for about $45 million, removing the original steam turbine engines and installing modern Caterpillar diesel engines. The ship was rebuilt at Tuzla Shipyards in Tuzla, a suburb of Istanbul, for the purpose of serving famous and important guests and helping to keep the memory of Atat√ºrk alive. Sadƒ±koƒülu rented her out as a luxury cruise ship to private clients. In fall 2010, many Turkish media published news about the alleged presence of underage prostitutes in some of those cruises, causing a scandal. Sadƒ±koƒülu, who was not present at the cruise, put in doubt the allegations later. Regardless, the lease contract was rescinded and the Turkish government took the ship back. After a new restoration period of 10 months, the Savarona was ready for official use in August 2014. However, it was not until March 4, 2015 that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had the first official reception on board, including a short cruise along the Bosporus, with his guest the Bosnian politician Bakir Izetbegoviƒá. Features Savarona features a swimming pool, a Turkish bath, a 282-foot (86 m) gold-trimmed grand staircase that survived from her original construction, a movie theater, and a library suite dedicated to Atat√ºrk, which is furnished with many of his personal artifacts. Under its charter operator the yacht was available for charter including the crew but not provisions. Specifications Source1949 figures are from Francis E. McMurtrie and Raymond V.B.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Futaro Yamada. The film was nominated for three Awards of the Japanese Academy and won two of them. Sanada won best newcomer of the year and Tokumichi Igawa and Yoshikazu Sano took the award for best art direction. The film was nominated for best sound but did not win the award. Plot Following the massacre of many thousands of Christians by soldiers of the Tokugawa Empire after the Shimabara Rebellion, Shiro Amakusa renounces the God who he feels abandoned them, and bargains his soul to the forces of darkness for the power to take his revenge. He gains the power to resurrect the dead, and begins with Hosokawa, the wife of a samurai who mocked her for her chastity and then left her to die during the invasion. Shiro restores her beauty in exchange for her loyalty. Next, they travel to the cave of legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, who regrets that he neglected his lovely wife to find more opponents to duel, and that his advanced age prevents him from challenging the one rival he considered worthy to test his technique. He initially resists the pair, but suffers a heart attack and agrees to join them. During this exchange, his cave is visited by Yagyu Jubei, son of a samurai master and a powerful swordsman in his own right. Jubei rushes to Musashi's aid only to find an empty suit of armor. The unholy trio then encounter Inshun, a Buddhist monk who is plagued with terrible fantasies of sex and death. Hosokawa taunts him with the failings of his monastic teachings, and he commits suicide in despair, becoming one of Shiro's undead in the process. At a local Iga ninja village, young Kirimaru is excited to learn that Jubei is on his way. However, before he can arrive, their Tokugawa controlled rivals the Koga ninja ambush the village with flaming arrows, killing everyone except Kirimaru. He fights his way through the forest against a female ninja, and is mortally wounded, but the female ninja is assaulted by Inshun. The rest of the Koga attack, but are quickly dispatched by the undead warriors. A dying Kirimaru is tenderly offered resurrection by Shiro, and he accepts. Jubei returns to the village to find it in shambles, and goes looking for Kirimaru. He encounters the undead battalion, now on horseback, and they taunt him before leaving, promising to meet again. Hosokawa poses as a beautiful maiden and seduces Tokugawa Ietsuna, allowing for her and her partners to murder many of his fellow shogunate. The terminally-ill swordsman Yagyu Tajima, father of Jubei, attempts to put a stop to them using a sword crafted by exiled sword maker Muramasa, and succeeds in killing Inshun, only to be thwarted by Shiro. Tajima initially declines their offers of joining them in their conquest, but is soon won over when his jealousy towards his son's swordsmanship is unleashed. In a remote shrine, Shiro chants a ritual curse to wither Tokugawa's crops. The curse succeeds, and a desperate mob petition the magistrate to lift their yearly tax in light of their situation, but his samurai attempt to drive the mob away. Kirimaru comes through the forest to find a young girl mourning the loss of her parents; her father was killed by one of the magistrate's men during the protest. He offers her a flower for their grave, but is overcome by remorse as she sings for them. Meanwhile, Jubei approaches the secluded mountain home of the legendary sword maker Muramasa. He is shocked to learn that his father approached Muramasa to commission a sword that would not only cut human flesh, but demonic spirits as well. Jubei wishes a similar sword as well, since Muramasa was exiled by his master Masamune due to his evil nature, and only a truly evil sword can defeat an evil demon. However, Muramasa's daughter Otsu claims that making the sword for Jubei's father has considerably weakened the smith. Muramasa reveals that Otsu is actually the daughter of Musashi's neglected wife who he has adopted as his own. Jubei tells them that he wants the sword to fight against Musashi and the rest of the demons. Just then, the ground begins to tremble as the undead Musashi approaches. Jubei bars the door, and Musashi begins to fight his way in until Otsu plays a haunting tune on her flute. Musashi recognizes the tune and staggers off confused. Muramasa agrees to make the most evil blade ever to help Jubei defeat the demons, and they begin construction. The villagers are approached by the Shogun's men, who read a proclamation that Tokugawa himself is coming for a lavish hunting party, and expects a high tribute in gold or servitude, nearly inciting a riot among the peasants. Shiro encounters a confused Kirimaru at the shrine, and encourages him to seduce the young girl he met, and to sacrifice her to their dark gods in order to shed his youthful turmoil. He attempts to force himself on the girl by a river, but finds he cannot go through with it. After she runs off, Jubei appears and confronts Kirimaru, who begs Jubei to kill him and put him out of his torment. Jubei draws his sword, however after hearing Kirimaru singing the same song the girl did, he tells Kirimaru that he is also a swordsman and thus his destiny is to fight. If he fights with all his ability and one day feels defeated by his own darkness, only then will Jubei release him. Jubei returns to Muramasa to continue work on his sword. During the Shogun's hunt, a number of villagers run through the field to present him with a written complaint about the taxes. Hosokawa uses her dark magic to convince Tokugawa and the elder Yagyu that the villagers are actually large deer, and they shoot the peasants down with arrows. Later, the peasant bodies have been crucified on a hill for all the village to see, and the people begin praying loudly and clacking stones together in mourning. Muramasa completes his greatest blade ever, and after telling Jubei \\"If you encounter God, God will be cut\\" he collapses dead. As the villagers' uneasy vigil extends into the night, Shiro possesses a local woman to tell the crowd that they can lift the curse by burning Tokugawa's men and spreading the ashes. He causes the bodies to glow, which finally incites the crowd to riot, tearing down the fence and charging the samurai on the hill. They cut down as many peasants as they can but are overwhelmed and killed. Shiro rides up and gives the crowd the magistrate's head on a pole, and incite them to ride to Edo and overthrow the Shogun. As the peasants march, Kirimaru attempts to escape with his girl, but is blocked by Shiro, who reveals Kirimaru's demonic nature. He tries to battle Shiro using his ninja training, but Shiro overcomes him with a magical whip that transforms into a flock of birds that strangle him. Jubei prepares to place Muramasa's body on a funeral pyre, when the girl brings him Kirimaru's body as well. Before they can act, Musashi approaches and challenges Jubei to meet him on an island at sunrise for a duel. He accepts, much to Otsu's chagrin, and declares it to be \\"the way of the sword\\". The following morning, he heads to the beach to battle Musashi, who claims not to be swayed a second time by Otsu's flute. The two masters engage each other on the surf as Otsu plays a frenetic tune, until Jubei finally splits Musashi's scabbard and face in half before impaling him through the heart. Musashi's lifeless body drifts out in the tide. As the peasants' furious uprising is advancing on the capital, the Shogun's advisors speculate on the future of the Empire. The dying Yagyu Tajima-no-kami Munenori is approached by Shiro about his son Jubei's impending arrival and yields to Shiro's dark influence. Revived from death by Shiro, Tajima begins killing the members of the castle. Meanwhile, Hosokawa Gracia has called out the name of her husband, lord Hosokawa Tadaoki, in her sleep, prompting a fit of jealously from the Shogun, her new lover. In the struggle, a lamp is knocked over and sets the room on fire. She freaks out, drawing a weapon and running through the castle declaring that she will not be abandoned again and confusing her lover with her husband. She begins attacking retainers, encountering Tajima who also attacks. With the building ablaze, and Hosokawa and Tajima on a killing rampage, the whole castle is thrown into chaos. Tajima kills many men and dares his son to come fight him before the flames die down. Upstairs, Hosokawa has the Shogun hostage in the fire, and Shiro reveals himself as the leader of the \\"Christian Believers\\". He condemns the Shogun to burn in agony as the Christians did. An insane Hosokawa promises to never leave his side, clutching him as they both fall into the fire. As the castle collapses, Tajima is confronted by Jubei, who has covered his body with Buddhist prayer symbols and chastises his father for obsessing only on his swordplay to the point of coming back from hell to fight his own son. The two begin to duel, during which Jubei loses his eyepatch; although his sword is broken, he disarms his father and kills him. Shiro appears and offers to let Jubei join him; Jubei declines and vows to set his father and Kirimaru's souls at peace. After a brief fight, Jubei decapitates Shiro; although this does not kill him, his body catches his head and promises to return as long as humans have evil in their heart before melting into the flames.

Lugaw includes various dishes, both savory and sweet. In Visayan regions, savory lugaw are collectively referred to as pospas. Lugaw is widely regarded as comfort food in the Philippines. Description Lugaw is traditionally made by boiling glutinous rice (Tagalog: malagkit; Visayan: pilit). Regular white rice may also be used if boiled with excess water. The basic version is sparsely spiced, usually only using salt, garlic, and ginger; or alternatively, sugar. Heartier versions are cooked in a chicken, fish, pork, or beef broth. It is regarded as a comforting and easy-to-digest food, typically prepared for breakfast and during cold and rainy weather. It is also commonly served to people who are sick or bedridden, and to very young children and the elderly. Lugaw is usually eaten hot or warm, since the gruel congeals if left to cool. It can be reheated by adding a little bit of water. Dessert versions, however, can be eaten cold or even partly frozen. Variants Lugaw can be paired or augmented with numerous other dishes and ingredients. =Savory= Chicken arroz caldo with safflower (kasubha) Most savory versions of lugaw are derived from or influenced by Chinese-style congee, introduced by Chinese-Filipino migrants. It has diverged over the centuries to use Filipino ingredients and suit the local tastes. Filipino savory lugaw are typically thicker than other Asian congees because they use glutinous rice. They are traditionally served with calamansi, soy sauce (toyo), or fish sauce (patis) as condiments Savory lugaw are usually paired with meat or seafood dishes. The most common being tokwa't baboy (cubed tofu and pork). *Arroz caldo ‚Äì lugaw heavily infused with ginger and garnished with toasted garlic, scallions, and black pepper with a hard-boiled egg. Most versions also add safflower (kasubha) which turns the dish characteristically yellow. *Goto ‚Äì lugaw made with goto (tripe) and ginger. It is garnished with toasted garlic, scallions, and black pepper. =Dessert= Champorado with dried fish (tuyo) Sweet versions of lugaw are more characteristically Filipino. They include: *Binignit ‚Äì lugaw made with coconut milk (gata) and various slices of fruit, jelly desserts (like sago, tapioca pearls, kaong, etc.), and root crops (like sweet potato, taro, and ube).

The Argos narrowly defeated the Lions 18‚Äì17, claiming their first Grey Cup victory in 31 years. Game summary Toronto Argonauts (18) - TDs, Jan Carinci, Cedric Minter; FGs, Hank Ilesic; cons., Ilesic; singles, Ilesic (2). BC Lions (17) - TDs, Mervyn Fernandez, John Henry White; FGs, Lui Passaglia; cons., Passaglia (2). The 1983 Grey Cup marked the first championship game where weather was not a deciding factor, as the final was held indoors for the first time at the new BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, which opened earlier in the year. Most notably, however, 1983 marked the end of the longest championship drought in the history of Canadian football's most successful team. The Toronto Argonauts, winners of a record 10 Grey Cups, had not sipped from the silver chalice since 1952. The Argos faced a difficult task. Not only did the BC Lions have a noisy, partisan crowd behind them, but Toronto's star quarterback Condredge Holloway was battling the flu. Holloway did manage, however, to complete a 14-yard touchdown toss to Jan Carinci in the second quarter to put the Double Blue on the board. Trailing 17-7, Toronto coach Bob O'Billovich elected to go with Joe Barnes at pivot in the second half. Slowly Barnes got the Argo offence going, but his efforts bore little fruit as Hank Ilesic missed three consecutive field goals. Two were good for singles, however, allowing Toronto to cut its deficit to eight points. When Ilesic finally split the uprights on a 43-yard attempt in the fourth quarter, it put the Argos within striking distance. Then, with four minutes remaining, Barnes executed one of the most important drives in Argonaut history. He hit Paul Pearson with a pass at the BC 45, but the ball was pried loose and popped into the air. In a most fortuitous return of the famed Argo Bounce, the ball miraculously landed in the hands of receiver Emanuel Tolbert, allowing the Boatmen to retain possession and continue their drive. Barnes went to work again, completing a pass to Tolbert at the BC 25 and another to Pearson on the three. With 2:44 left in regulation, Barnes flipped the ball to a wide-open Cedric Minter in the end zone, giving the Argos their first lead of the game. The subsequent two-point convert attempt fell incomplete. Leading by one, Toronto forced BC to punt on its next possession, allowing the Argos to run out most of the clock. BC's Roy Dewalt had one last chance to throw a Hail Mary pass with one second remaining, but his prayer wasn't answered and long- suffering Argonaut fans took to the streets in jubilation. BC scored its points on touchdown passes by Dewalt to Mervyn Fernandez and John Henry White. Lui Passaglia also kicked a 31-yard field goal. Trivia * Hank Ilesic, who came directly from high school to the CFL, won his sixth consecutive Grey Cup and played in his seventh consecutive Grey Cup game, all in his first seven years in the league (he was with the Eskimos for all of his Grey Cup appearances prior to this one, his first with the Argos). * The 1983 game marked the first occasion that the Grey Cup was played indoors, and was the first championship game played at the newly opened BC Place Stadium; it was also the first Grey Cup game to be played with the 20-yard endzones (shorter than the then-standard 25 yards, BC Place was the first stadium in the CFL to have 20-yard endzones); the shorter endzone size would become the league standard three years later. * This was the first Grey Cup game held in Western Canada since 1975 at McMahon Stadium in Calgary; from 1976 to 1982, the game was held in alternating years in either Toronto or Montreal. * The Argonaut defence, led by CB Carl Brazley and DE Rick Mohr, held the Lions scoreless for the entire second half. 1983 CFL Playoffs =West Division= * Semi-final (November 13 @ Winnipeg, Manitoba) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 49-22 Edmonton Eskimos * Final (November 20 @ Vancouver, British Columbia) BC Lions 39-21 Winnipeg Blue Bombers =East Division= * Semi-final (November 13 @ Ottawa, Ontario) Hamilton Tiger-Cats 33-31 Ottawa Rough Riders * Final (November 20 @ Toronto, Ontario) Toronto Argonauts 41-36 Hamilton Tiger-Cats References External links * Category:Grey Cup Grey Cup Category:Grey Cups hosted in Vancouver Category:Toronto Argonauts Category:1983 in British Columbia Category:BC Lions Category:1980s in Vancouver Category:1983 in Canadian television Category:November 1983 sports events in Canada ","title":"71st Grey Cup"},{"id":"8883178","text":"Tsse may refer to: * Tsse (Cyrillic) (Íöê Íöë), a letter of the Cyrillic script * TssE, a constituent protein in the baseplate of a Type VI secretion system ","title":"Tsse"},{"id":"8883201","text":"Corozal Airport is an airport that serves Corozal, Belize.

Climate Spanning the northern and southern aspects of the Himalayan crest, the park experiences a wide climatic range and lies in the transition zone from a monsoon dominated to an arid climate. Annual precipitation reaches in the south, whereas on northern slopes less than of rain falls. Most of the precipitation occurs during monsoon from July to September. The Dhaulagiri and Kanjiroba massifs form a massive barrier preventing most of the rain from reaching the Trans-Himalayan area. Winters are quite severe with frequent snowfalls above and temperatures remaining below freezing above through much of the winter. Flora and fauna The flora found within the park is extremely diverse. The northern regions contain barren areas of the upper Himalayas. The Trans-Himalayan slope lands consist of some rhododendron, caragana shrubs, salix, juniper, white Himalayan birch, and the occasional silver fir dominate the high meadows of the Himalayas. Less than five percent of the park is forested, with much of it lying in the southern portion. The Suligad Vally‚Äôs flora consists of blue pine, spruce, hemlock, cedar, silver fir, poplar, rhododendron, and bamboo. The park also contains 286 species of ethnobotanical importance. The park provides important habitat for endangered species including the snow leopard, grey wolf, musk deer, and blue sheep. Goral, great Tibetan sheep, Himalayan tahr, leopard, jackal, Himalayan black bear and yellow-throated marten are also found in the park. The park is home to six reptiles and 29 species of butterfly, including the highest flying butterfly in the world, Paralasa nepalaica. The park provides habitat for over 200 species of birds, such as Tibetan partridge, wood snipe, white-throated tit, wood accentor and crimson-eared rosefinch. Culture The park contains many gompas and religious sites, many of which have been renovated. Shey Gompa, the most famous, was established in the 11th century. Thashung Gompa located near Phoksundo Lake was built about 900 years ago to conserve wildlife. Ringmo village, a typical Tibetan village, is scenically nestled in the park. The park is home to more than 9,000 people, and their villages are among the highest settlements on earth. The local people are subsistence farmers growing potatoes, buckwheat, mustard, beans and some barley; and keeping livestock for food and wool. They barter with Tibetans for salt and wool. Their lifestyle is typically Tibetan. Most of them are Buddhists; the people around Phoksundo area practice B√∂n. There are communal gompas in most of the villages.

Originally established on 1 November 1970 at NAS Belle Chase, Louisiana, it was disestablished in September 2006. It was the second squadron to be designated VP-94, the first VP-94 was redesignated VPB-94 on 1 October 1944. Operational history SP-2H at AMARC in 1992 P-3B landing at NAS Dallas in February 1986 VP-94 was initially established on 1 November 1970 at NAS Belle Chase, as a Naval Air Reserve landbased patrol squadron flying 12 SP-2H Neptunes. VP-94 was formed from VP-821 and VP-822, both established in 1965. These squadrons were redesignated VP-61X1 and VP-45X2 in May 1968, and were combined in November 1970 to form VP-94. The new squadron came under the operational and administrative control of the Commander, Naval Air Reserve Force. VP-94 was established as a result of a major reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve that took place in mid-1970. Under the Reserve Force Squadron concept 12 land-based naval reserve patrol squadrons were formed and structured along the lines of regular Navy squadrons with nearly identical organization and manning levels. Under the 12/2/1 concept there were 12 VP squadrons divided between two commands, COMFAIRESWINGLANT and COMFAIRESWINGPAC. These two commands came under the control of one central authority, Commander Naval Air Reserve. In March 1989, the Department of Defense organized Operation Hat Trick III, an exercise employing the efforts of several reserve patrol squadrons, staging out of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puerto Rico. This operation, the largest drug interdiction operation using reserve forces to date, resulted in the capture of a record number of narcotics carrying vessels and aircraft. After the success of this operation, Atlantic reserve patrol squadrons routinely devoted a portion of their two- week ACDUTRA time each year on drug interdiction patrols with the United States Coast Guard based out of NS Roosevelt Roads and NAS Key West, Florida Reserve and active duty Navy patrol squadrons had previously assisted the Coast Guard in drug interdiction flights in the Caribbean area since 1985. On 2 January 1993 VP-94 was assigned to CTF 67.1 at NAS Sigonella, Sicily, and CTF 67.2 at Naval Base Rota, Spain, in support of Adriatic Sea embargo flights for Operation Maritime Guard against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. These were armed flights carrying Harpoon antiship missiles. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire between warring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia and to prevent outside factions from providing re-supply by sea. From June‚ÄìJuly 1993 the squadron supplied detachments for Operation Sharp Guard in support of UN operations. This concept of separate detachment deployments, rather than entire unit deployments, became known as flexible detachment operations, or Det Ops. This form of deployment provided the maximum amount of interoperability between USN and USNR forward deployed forces, while supporting real operations and not just training flights for the Reserves. Reserve Det Ops also served as a much-needed supplement to the active-duty patrol squadrons in an era of post-Cold War cutbacks. In October 1993 a Det Ops deployment was conducted to NS Roosevelt Roads, to provide support for operations Uphold Democracy and Able Mariner, the UN sanctioned embargo of Haiti. VP-94 was one of 13 Reserve patrol squadrons assigned to Reserve Patrol Wing Atlantic (RESPATWINGLANT) and Reserve Patrol Wing Pacific/Patrol Wing FOUR (RESPATWINGPAC/PatWing 4) under the operational control of Naval Air Reserve Force (NAVAIRESFOR), later redesignated as Naval Air Force Reserve (NAVAIRES). All Naval Reserve Force Squadrons, patrol, fighter, fighter/attack, etc., are/were colloquially referred to as Reserve Force Squadrons, or RESFORONS, manned by a combination of full-time active duty Training and Administration of the Reserve/Full Time Support (TAR/FTS) and traditional part-time Selected Reserve (SELRES) personnel. TAR/FTS personnel nominally comprised approximately 33% of these squadrons' manning and SELRES approximately 67%. The squadron's part-time personnel, especially the aircrews, were required and funded to perform far more than the typical one weekend a month and two weeks a year of duty, with many averaging 120 or more man-days of military duty annually.Wings at the Ready; Richard Shipman; Naval Institute Press; Annapolis, MD; c1991; Following the demise of the Soviet Union, and the reduction in Russian naval activity, and the perceived \\"Peace Dividend\\" of the mid-1990s, much of the US Navy's P-3 patrol aircraft fleet was subjected to budgetary reductions. In the case of the active duty P-3 fleet, the entire patrol aviation (VP) community was reduced by 50%, going from 24 deployable P-3C fleet squadrons and two fleet replacement squadrons, to 12 deployable P-3C fleet squadrons and one single-site fleet replacement squadron. The Reserve VP community of 13 P-3B and P-3C squadrons was subjected to more drastic reductions. VP-94 was one of 11 Reserve VP squadrons disestablished to cut costs. Eliminated were all squadrons operating P-3B aircraft, which were retired to AMARC, and eliminating all but two Reserve P-3C squadrons, transferring the bulk of the Reserve P-3C aircraft to the Regular Navy at the principal active duty P-3 bases.

This gave the idea renewed impetus and a remaining trust member, Ralph Allen revived the proposal. The local Maori Runaka, Kati Huirapa of Puketeraki became supporters of the trust. =Site= View across Blueskin Bay towards the forested Orokonui Valley The Ecosanctuary is in a north-facing valley comprising about 250 hectare (ha) of regenerating native forest. The trust gained the use of the 230 ha Orokonui Conservation Area 20 km north of central Dunedin. The New Zealand Department of Conservation approved the trust's use of the land'Bringing back the natives', p14, Otago Daily TimesSuperb Asset on orokonui.org.nz and completed a heads of agreement and the Orokonui site was visited on 27 April 2006 by Chris Carter, the New Zealand Minister of Conservation. The trust purchased and added a further 67 hectares of adjacent land to the Conservation Area. The donation of 57 ha from an adjacent landowner extended the proposed Ecosanctuary area by 20%. In May 2007, the trust announced that the sanctuary might expand in future onto adjacent public land. =Fundraising= A fundraising appeal was launched in November 2005.'Orokonui appeal takes flight', p1, Otago Daily Times, 3 November 2005 The trust ran two public fundraising campaigns in 2006-2007: the public were urged to donate their soon-to-be-withdrawn New Zealand 5-cent coins while a \\"sponsor a fencepost\\" campaign was run in conjunction with the Otago Daily Times newspaper.

It uses stainless steel mesh that continues down to form a skirt at ground level that prevents animals from burrowing under it. On the top is a curved steel hood that prevents climbing animals like cats and possums from climbing over the top. Waterways are protected by screened culverts nicknamed \\"watergates\\", while pedestrian access is by airlock style double gates. In February 2007 a donation of a further 57 ha from an adjacent landowner increased the planned 7.2 km length of fence by 2 km to 9 km.from blueskin.co.nz The additional land was mainly pine plantation but considered to be of benefit as the trees when felled would give a good habitat for huhu grubs, an important food source for kƒÅkƒÅ. Earthworks for the fence were finished in May 2007. The fence was completed and the sanctuary officially \\"closed\\" on 3 July 2007 in the presence of the Waitati Militia. =Pest eradication= Pest eradication commenced in August 2007 with shooting of goats and 800 possums by ground-based teams.'Orokonui Ecosanctuary issues poison warning' on blueskin.co.nz, retrieved 08 September 2007 This was immediately followed by the scattering from aircraft of bait poisoned with brodifacoum into the fenced area.

Frederick Barbarossa, the emperor, invested Conrad as count and granted him the Rocca as his seat of power. During his countship, Saint Francis was born at Assisi. In 1183, Frederick appointed him duke of Spoleto. In 1190, he was chased from Spoleto by the ascendant Guelph powers, but he regained his duchy in 1195. He briefly sheltered the young Emperor Frederick II at the Rocca and acted as the vicar of the Kingdom of Sicily, but in 1198 he was ordered to render Spoleto to the Pope and during his absence, Assisi rebelled and declared a commune.

He first became a prominent general during Western Wei as he defended the fortress of Yubi (ÁéâÂ£Å, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) against a vastly larger army commanded by rival Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and he eventually contributed greatly to the destruction of Eastern Wei's successor state Northern Qi by Northern Zhou. His final campaign, in 580, saw him siding with the regent Yang Jian against the general Yuchi Jiong in Northern Zhou's civil war, allowing Yang to defeat Yuchi and (after Wei's death) take over the throne as Sui Dynasty's Emperor Wen. More so than other prominent generals at the time, Wei was known for using atypical strategies in both offense and defense, including extensive use of espionage and forgeries to undermine the morale of opposing forces.  During Northern Wei  Wei Xiaokuan was born in 509, during Western Wei's predecessor Northern Wei (which Western Wei and its rival Eastern Wei were divided from)  specifically, during the reign of Emperor Xuanwu. His clan was a prominent one in the Sanfu (‰∏âËºî, greater Chang'an) region, and both his grandfather Wei Zhenxi (ÈüãÁúüÊÜô) and father Wei Xu (ÈüãÊó≠) were commandery governors during Northern Wei. In Wei Xiaokuan's youth, he was described to be studious and calm. When the general Xiao Baoyin rebelled in 527 and seized the Chang'an region, he was at the capital Luoyang, and he volunteered to serve in the army against Xiao. He served as an officer under Zhangxun Chengye (Èï∑Â≠´ÊâøÊ•≠) the Duke of Fengyi and contributed to the army's success, and he was given a post as a teacher at the national university in Luoyang, and then an acting commandery governor. He later served under the prominent official Yang Kan (Ê•ä‰æÉ), guarding the Tong Pass, when Yang, impressed by him, gave a daughter to him in marriage. Wei became a general during the reign of Emperor Xiaozhuang (528-530) and was created the Baron of Shanbei. During the subsequent reign of Emperor Jiemin (531-532), he served under the official Yuan Zigong (Ê∫êÂ≠êÊÅ≠), the governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern southern Henan) as a commandery governor. It was at this time he became friends with fellow general Dugu Xin, who was also a commandery governor in Jing Province. In the subsequent reign of Emperor Xiaowu (532-535), Wei was given the task of defending Jing Province, although he was not then governor. Subsequently, when Emperor Xiaowu, seeking to evade the influence of the paramount general Gao Huan, fled west to Chang'an, then controlled by Yuwen Tai, in 534, the empire became divided into Western Wei (with Emperor Xiaowu as emperor) and Eastern Wei (with Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei, whom Gao declared emperor, as emperor). It is unclear when or how, but Wei eventually joined the Western Wei regime in Chang'an, but it is not clear whether that happened before or after Emperor Xiaowu's death (probably by Yuwen's orders) in 535 and replacement by his cousin Emperor Wen of Western Wei.  During Western Wei  In 538, during a major campaign between Western Wei and Eastern Wei, Wei Xiaokuan accompanied Emperor Wen, and he was made the governor of Hongnong Commandery (ÂºòËæ≤, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). He subsequently entered Luoyang (which Western Wei temporarily captured) with Dugu Xin, and for some time tried to defend the city, but eventually they were forced to withdrew from the vicinity of Luoyang. As Wei was then stationed on the borders with Eastern Wei, he became concerned that the Eastern Wei general Niu Daoheng (ÁâõÈÅìÊÅÜ) was capable at drawing the common people of the border region to join Eastern Wei's cause. Wei employed a tactic that he would reuse later‚Äîfirst sending spies to steal samples of Niu's handwriting, and then employing forgers to forge letters purportedly from Niu to Wei offering to defect to Western Wei. He then intentionally allowed spies sent by Niu's superior Duan Chen (ÊÆµÁêõ) to steal the forgeries, causing Duan to suspect Niu's loyalty and begin to refuse to follow Niu's suggestions. Once Wei was sure of the dissension within the Eastern Wei forces, he made a surprise attack and captured both Duan and Niu, taking the locale for Western Wei. In 539, Emperor Wen promoted Wei's title from baron to marquess. In 542, Wei was made the governor of Jin Province (ÊôâÂ∑û, roughly modern Linfen, Shanxi), and by the recommendation of the prominent general Wang Sizheng (ÁéãÊÄùÊîø), was given by Yuwen Tai the responsibility of defending the important fort of Yubi (ÁéâÂ£Å, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), which Wang himself had defended earlier. He managed to pacify the province against raids by the ethnic Xiongnu tribesmen in the area. In 546, Gao Huan launched a major attack on Western Wei, and as Yubi was an important fort on his path, he put it under siege. He built earthworks to surround the city, hoping to be able to breach Yubi's defenses on top of the walls, but Wei managed to build on top of the towers on top of the walls, always maintaining a higher vantage point than the earthworks and therefore stopping the Eastern Wei attack. Gao then tried digging tunnels below the walls, but Wei was able to anticipate this and dig tunnels himself to connect with Eastern Wei's tunnels, and then setting fires within the tunnels, burning the Eastern Wei soldiers to death. He further set fires to the Eastern Wei army's battering rams, and for every offensive strategy Gao was able to think of, Wei was able to counter it. Gao had his secretary Zu Ting write a letter to Wei, urging him to surrender, but Wei refused. Gao was unable to capture the fort after 60 days of siege, and he grew angry and ill and was forced to withdraw. For Wei's contributions, he was created the Duke of Jianzhong. In 553, during the reign of Emperor Wen's son Emperor Fei, Wei was made the governor of the capital region, Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). In 554, Wei participated in the campaign commanded by Yu Jin (‰∫éË¨π) against Liang Dynasty, which eventually captured its capital Jiangling and its emperor Emperor Yuan. (Western Wei eventually put the Liang emperor to death around the new year 555.) After this campaign, Wei's title was changed to Duke of Rang, and as at the time, Yuwen Tai was choosing prominent Han generals to have their names changed to Xianbei names, Wei's name was changed to Yuwen, probably as a sign of respect and endearment on Yuwen Tai's part. In 556, when Yuwen Tai was carrying out a tour of the northern provinces, he returned Wei to the responsibility of defending Yubi.  During Emperors Xiaomin and Ming's reigns  Yuwen Tai died later in 556, leaving his son and heir Yuwen Jue under the guardianship of his nephew Yuwen Hu. Around the new year 557, Yuwen Hu forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and founding Northern Zhou, with Yuwen Jue taking the throne as Emperor Xiaomin, but with the alternative title of \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang). Wei was made the deputy minister of the interior. After Yuwen Hu removed and killed Emperor Xiaomin later in 557 and replaced him with another son of Yuwen Tai, Yuwen Yu the Duke of Ningdu (as Emperor Ming), Wei took on the additional responsibility as an imperial researcher. (It might have been the case that this was Yuwen Hu's way of removing Wei from a military command without dishonoring him, for Wei's great friend Dugu Xin opposed Yuwen Hu and, in 557, was forced to commit suicide on account of that opposition.) In 560, Yuwen Hu poisoned Emperor Ming to death, and Emperor Ming's brother Yuwen Yong the Duke of Lu became emperor (as Emperor Wu).  During Emperor Wu's reign  In 561, in recognition of Wei's great victory at Yubi previously, Yubi and the surrounding area was made into Xun Province (Âã≥Â∑û  \\"Xun\\" meaning \\"achievement\\"), and Wei was made its governor. During this tenure, Wei was said to be gracious to the people of the province while continuing to effectively employ a network of spies. For example, when his officer Xu Pen (Ë®±ÁõÜ) defected to Northern Qi, Wei sent spies after him, and was quickly able to have him killed. Around this time, Xun Province continued to be plagued by raids by the ethnic Xiongnu who, while not submitting to either Northern Zhou or Northern Qi, were based within Northern Qi territory and cut off river traffic on the Fen River (Ê±æÊ∞¥, flowing through modern Linfen). In order to cut off the route of their raids, Wei sent his officer Yao Yue (ÂßöÂ≤≥) to build a fort near the Fen River. Yao initially was fearful that as his troops were building the fort that Northern Qi would launch an attack against him, but Wei warded off Northern Qi attacks by setting up bonfires in the surrounding hills, making Northern Qi forces believe that Yao was being reinforced by a large army, and therefore did not attack Yao, allowing Yao to complete the fort. In 564, Wei helped negotiate an agreement where Northern Qi returned Yuwen Tai's sister and sister-in-law (Yuwen Hu's mother) to Northern Zhou in exchange for peace. When, late in 564, Yuwen Hu nevertheless was preparing to launch an attack on Northern Qi (in order to placate the northern ally Tujue, Wei sent his secretary Xin Daoxian (ËæõÈÅìÊÜ≤) to try to dissuade Yuwen Hu, but Yuwen Hu nevertheless launched the attack, which was unsuccessful. In 570, the two states were stalemated while fighting for the control of the city of Yiyang (ÂÆúÈôΩ, in modern Luoyang). Wei, believing that Yiyang was not worth the effort and instead was apprehensive that Northern Qi would encroach on territory north of the Fen River, sent a proposal to Yuwen Hu to build forts north of the Fen River to guard the territory. Yuwen Hu, however, responded, \\"While Duke Wei has many descendants, they do not yet number a hundred. Who will be able to guard those forts?\\" Thereafter, the forts were not built. Later in 570, Wei's title was promoted to Duke of Xun. That winter, as forewarned by Wei, the Northern Qi general Hul√º Guang encroached on Northern Zhou territory north of the Fen River and built forts there, seizing substantial territory. Wei personally met Hul√º on the border to try to dissuade him from the campaign, but Hul√º did not relent. The armies stalemated after Yuwen Hu sent reinforcements commanded by Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Duke of Qi, but territory was already lost. By 572, however, Hul√º was in conflict with the powerful officials Zu Ting and Mu Tipo, both of whom were trusted by the Northern Qi emperor Gao Wei. Wei, hearing this, wanted to create further suspicions in Gao Wei's mind against Hul√º, and he decided to try to create a sense that Hul√º would rebel. He wrote two songs in couplets, one of which read: :A hundred sheng [(Âçá, a measurement unit  and 100 sheng made up one hu (Êñõ))] will fly up to the heavens, :A bright moon [(ÊòéÊúà, mingyue, Hul√º's courtesy name)] will shine over Chang'an. The other read: :The high [(È´ò, gao)] mountain will collapse on its own, :The daimyo oak [(Êß≤, hu)] will stand straight on its own. He sent spies to spread the songs near Northern Qi's capital Yecheng, and the songs soon became popular. Zu, exploiting the situation himself, added two more lines: :The blind man will bear a great axe, :The talkative woman will be unable to speak. Both Zu, who was blind, and Mu's mother Lu Lingxuan (Gao Wei's wet nurse and presumably the \\"talkative woman\\") both discussed the songs with Gao Wei, and Gao Wei, his suspicions having been aroused, eventually agreed to have Hul√º put to death, greatly weakening the Northern Qi military efforts. After Hul√º's death, Emperor Wu (who had ambushed and killed Yuwen Hu earlier that year and assumed power himself) became particularly ambitious at conquering Northern Qi, and seeing this, Wei submitted three strategies for conquering Northern Qi to Emperor Wu. Also around this time, on account of his old age, Wei repeatedly made offers to resign and retire, but Emperor Wu repeatedly responded with edicts of kind words requesting him to stay. In 576, when Emperor Wu launched a major attack on Northern Qi, he visited Yubi and praised Wei for his defense of the fort. Wei offered to be the forward commander for the attack, but Emperor Wu declined on reason that he needed Wei to defend Yubi still. However, he sent Wei to assist his brother Yuwen Zhao (ÂÆáÊñáÊãõ) the Prince of Zhao in a secondary campaign near Yubi. After Emperor Wu conquered Northern Qi in 577, he returned to Yubi and took Wei back to the capital Chang'an with him, promoting Wei to the post of minister of agriculture. Subsequently, however, Emperor Wu made Wei the governor of Yan Province (Âª∂Â∑û, roughly modern Yan'an, Shaanxi), in charge of the surrounding provinces.  During Emperors Xuan and Jing's reigns  Emperor Wu died in 578, and his son Yuwen Yun the Crown Prince succeeded him (as Emperor Xuan). In 579, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan the Crown Prince (as Emperor Jing), although he held onto power as retired emperor (with the atypical title of \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂ∏ù, Tianyuan Huangdi). Later that year, Emperor Xuan made Wei Xiaokuan in charge of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, roughly modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) and the surrounding provinces, and Wei subsequently participated in the campaign against rival Chen Dynasty that allowed Northern Zhou to seize the region between the Yangtze River and Huai River from Chen. Wei's contribution was in capturing the important city of Shouyang, and when Emperor Xuan's cousin Yuwen Liang (ÂÆáÊñá‰∫Æ) the Duke of Qi, angry and fearful that Emperor Xuan had recently raped his daughter-in-law Yuchi Chifan, tried to ambush Wei to seize his troops to further act against Emperor Xuan, Wei defeated Yuwen Liang. For these achievements, one of Wei's sons was created the Duke of Hua. In 580, Emperor Xuan died, and Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian the Duke of Sui‚Äîthe son-in-law of Wei's great friend Dugu Xin‚Äîbecame regent. Yang, suspicious that the general Yuchi Jiong (Yuchi Chifan's grandfather), in charge of Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û, roughly modern Handan, Hebei) and the surrounding regions, tried to replace Yuchi with Wei. Yuchi, however, was suspicious that Yang was intending to usurp the throne, decided to rise against Yang. When Wei approached Xiang Province, he realized this, and he pretended to be ill, and instead tried to flee to Luoyang‚Äîon the way, leaving instruction to each post to give feasts to Yuchi's soldiers if they gave chase. Yuchi indeed sent soldiers after Wei, but the soldiers were slowed by the feasts given to them, and were not able to track Wei down. Once Wei reached Luoyang, he carefully guarded the city, and although the ethnically Xianbei soldiers in the city considered rising in support of Yuchi, they ultimately did not do so. Yang then put Wei in charge of the army against Yuchi. He first defeated Yuchi's general Xue Gongli (ËñõÂÖ¨Á¶Æ), who was attacking Huai Province (Êá∑Â∑û, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and then crossed the Yellow River north. He defeated Yuchi's son Yuchi Dun (Â∞âÈÅ≤ÊÉá) near Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng and then put Yecheng under siege. The city soon fell, and Yuchi Jiong committed suicide. Wei slaughtered the core troops that remained loyal to Yuchi to the end. Wei returned to Chang'an victoriously, and died a month later.

The range covers an area including Alamance County, Guilford County, Randolph County, and Chatham County in North Carolina. Formation The mountains are typical of the rolling terrain of the piedmont region of North Carolina, and are somewhat similar in formation to the nearby Caraway Mountains and Uwharrie Mountains. The Cane Creek Mountains may have formed as a part of the larger coastal range that was once the Uwharries, which are thought to have formed as a part of the Alleghenian or Appalachian orogeny 300‚Äì350 million years ago during the formation and rifting of Pangaea. This earlier range is thought to have had peaks more than high, which would rival the Himalayas, the Andes, and the Alaska Range. However, erosion has worn this old mountain range down. The highest peaks of this old range are now found in the Appalachian Mountains on the eastern coast of North America and in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco in Africa. The heavily eroded hills of piedmont, including the Cane Creek Mountains, are remnants of the sizable mountain chain. Geology The Cane Creek Mountains lie in the Carolina Slate Belt,USGS Map of Carolina Slate Belt a belt that consists of heated and deformed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The belt is best known for old abandoned gold mines. North Carolina led the nation in gold production for 50 years, between the discovery of a 17-pound (7.7 kg) gold nugget at the Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County, NC near Charlotte in 1799 and the discovery of gold during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Limited gold mining continues to take place, but several mining companies continue to operate, both on the slate belt and in and near the Cane Creek Mountains. Most mineral production in the area is crushed stone for road aggregate and pyrophyllite for factories, ceramics, filler, paint and insecticide carriers.USGS Publication Geography The northern edge of the mountains begins on the southern bank of Great Alamance Creek, approximately south of Interstate 40 in Graham and runs in a southwesterly direction towards Liberty in Randolph County. The range covers much of the southwest quadrant of Alamance County. While much of the range is a series of rolling hills that are common throughout the North Carolina Piedmont Region, there are several peaks in the Cane Creek Mountains located north of Snow Camp. The highest point in the range and in Alamance County is Cane Creek Mountain, which is approximately .TopoZone Perhaps the most famous peak in the range is the 267 m (902 ft) Bass Mountain, the former home of an annual bluegrass music festival. Contrary to some local belief, Bass Mountain is not the highest peak in the range, although the range is occasionally referred to as the \\"Bass Mountains\\". History The mountains and Alamance County were home to the local Native American tribes, including the Sissipahaw. The area saw major activity during the American Colonial and Revolutionary period, with several battles taking place in and near the range, including Pyle's Massacre and the Battle of Alamance. There are several cave sites throughout the mountains where local historians theorize that small military parties may have been able to fortify their position. Current Use The mountains are home to families, farms, and television, radio, and cellular communications towers. There is also a fire tower located on top of Cane Creek Mountain that is no longer safe for use. Nearby Mountains The piedmont region of North Carolina is home to several small mountain ranges and monadnocks, including: *Stony Creek Mountain - a monadnock in Northern Alamance County that rises to 288 m (938 ft) *Caraway Mountains - a small range in Randolph County, to the southwest *Uwharrie Mountains - a range of mountains in four counties southwest of the Cane Creeks *Occoneechee Mountain - a monadnock near the Eno River in Orange County to the east References Category:Mountains of North Carolina Category:Mountain ranges of North Carolina Category:Landforms of Alamance County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Guilford County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Randolph County, North Carolina Category:Landforms of Chatham County, North Carolina ","title":"Cane Creek Mountains"},{"id":"8883431","text":"The 72nd Grey Cup was the 1984 Canadian Football League championship game, played at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Blue Bombers dominated the Tiger-Cats in a 47‚Äì17 victory. Game summary Winnipeg Blue Bombers (47) - TDs, Willard Reaves (2), Joe Poplawski, Stan Mikawos, Jeff Boyd; FGs, Trevor Kennerd (4); cons., Kennerd (5). Hamilton Tiger-Cats (17) - TDs, Dieter Brock, Rocky DiPietro; FGs, Bernie Ruoff; cons., Ruoff (2). Most experts believed the contest was a mismatch, with the Blue Bombers heavily favoured. They turned out to be correct, but not before the Hamilton Tiger-Cats stunned the Bombers by jumping out to an early 17‚Äì3 lead. Winnipeg quarterback Tom Clements was ineffective in the opening 15 minutes, getting picked off twice by Felix Wright and Mark Streeter. Both interceptions led to Hamilton scores. Former Bomber pivot Dieter Brock scored on a 15-yard scamper, and completed a seven- yard pass to Rocky DiPietro for the other major. But the Winnipeg Blue Bombers would soon dominate and take over the game. Their initial points came on a 25-yard field goal by Trevor Kennerd to close out the opening quarter. In the second quarter, after Bernie Ruoff booted a 20-yard field goal to give the Ticats a 17‚Äì3 lead, the Bombers responded with a 27-point explosion to close out the half. Clements, who played the entire contest with a rib injury, improved as the game wore on, completing a 12-yard touchdown pass to Joe Poplawski to give Winnipeg the lead for good. The turning point came at 2:26 before halftime, when Brock was levelled by Winnipeg linebacker Tyrone Jones. The ball was jarred loose and nose tackle Stan Mikawos recovered the fumble and ran 22 yards for a touchdown. This put the Bombers in front 24‚Äì17. Willard Reaves, the CFL Most Outstanding Player, scored a pair of touchdowns on three- yard carries. His action was limited due to an injured shoulder, but he did rush for 64 yards. Bomber cornerback David Shaw intercepted a Brock pass in the second quarter, returning the ball 26 yards to the Hamilton 28 to help set up one of Reaves' TD runs. Winnipeg's backup quarterback John Hufnagel tossed a four-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Boyd in the fourth quarter to complete the scoring. Trivia * Winnipeg scored the final 44 points of the game. * The game featured two all-star quarterbacks, Brock and Clements, (winners of the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award), who had been traded for each other late in the previous season. * The 1984 game, the first Grey Cup held in Edmonton, Alberta, was played in chilly -10 ¬∞C (14 ¬∞F) weather. * Winnipeg's 27 second- quarter points was a new Grey Cup record for most points in a quarter. However, the Blue Bombers would break their own record in the 1990 Grey Cup by scoring 28 in the third quarter of that contest. * The win was the first Grey Cup victory for the Bombers since 1962, and their last Grey Cup title and appearance as a West Division team until 2019 (also against Hamilton). During the period between 1987 and 2013, the Blue Bombers made seven Grey Cup appearances and won two titles as an East Division team. They were also the first non-Edmonton Eskimo Western Division team to win the Grey Cup since the Calgary Stampeders won it in 1971. * 1984 marked the first Grey Cup played on natural grass since the 1970 game at Toronto's CNE Stadium. Since then, there have been three Grey Cup games played on natural grass: at Commonwealth Stadium in 1997 and 2002 (it switched to FieldTurf in 2010), and Toronto's BMO Field in 2016. 1984 CFL Playoffs =West Division= * Semi-final (November 4 @ Winnipeg, Manitoba) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 55‚Äì20 Edmonton Eskimos * Final (November 11 @ Vancouver, British Columbia) Winnipeg Blue Bombers 31‚Äì14 BC Lions =East Division= * Semi-final (November 4 @ Hamilton, Ontario) Hamilton Tiger-Cats 17‚Äì11 Montreal Concordes * Final (November 11 @ Toronto, Ontario) Hamilton Tiger-Cats 14‚Äì13 Toronto Argonauts OT External links * Category:Grey Cup Category:1984 in Canadian football Category:Grey Cups hosted in Edmonton Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers Category:1984 in Alberta Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats Category:1980s in Edmonton Category:1984 in Canadian television Category:November 1984 sports events in Canada ","title":"72nd Grey Cup"},{"id":"8883455","text":"Atto (or Hatto) was the Duke of Spoleto from 653 to 663, the successor of Theodelap.

Built in 1911, it is a one-of-a-kind architectural landmark combining Victorian and presaging modern styles, featuring unique experimental glazed bricks. It is also fondly remembered among locals as the Spudnut Shop. It was listed on the National Register in 1994. It consists of the original 1911 glazed brick building, plus a newer basement structure, plus a rear blond brick addition. With History The Quaintance Block was originally built in 1911 directly on the southeast corner of 13th Street and Washington Avenue, just to the east of its present location. Charles F. Quaintance, a son of pioneers, built this as his new building to house, in its three storefronts, his photo shop (13th Street storefront), Quaintance Realty & Investment Company (corner storefront), and the law office of his brother Arthur (Washington Avenue storefront). A highly astute businessman and promoter, Quaintance strategically located his building across from both of Golden's tramway depots on the opposite corners, luring passengers by advertising his Castle Rock Resort overlooking town. Here, eager patrons would get their photos taken with burros, which would take them up the mountain, and while they were away, Quaintance developed their photos to be ready when the tourists returned. After the resort faded following the advent of the Denver Mountain Parks, Quaintance concentrated on other pursuits. In 1923, Quaintance moved the building 65 feet west to make way for downtown's first stand-alone service station (a Conoco) on the corner, arranging for his building to face upon a courtyard and shifting his rooftop billboard east. Upon his death in 1940, his father, Brough, took over the business until he died in 1946, whereupon the investment company ceased operation. The building was sold to Ernie Waters, who converted it into the Golden Furniture Store, later owned by Cliff Evans. After Evans consolidated it with another furniture store that he purchased on Washington Avenue, Leonard and Pat Dunn opened the Spudnut Shop here in 1953. Quickly becoming beloved among Goldenites, it was a shop of the national chain which sold, from Alaska to Mexico, delicious donuts made from potato flour (\\"spud\\"nuts). Customers often bought them at the shop, while Dunn also sent out delivery boys carrying baskets of Spudnuts, whom he called his \\"little businessmen\\". Later owned by Eleanor Laseman, the shop closed when its space was annexed by neighboring Jeffco Blueprints office supply store in 1984. After this closed, the building was faithfully restored to its original appearance in 1990 under direction of Conrad and Ingrid Gardner. Owned by the couple, it houses the Gardner law office and other tenants. The Quaintance Block was designated a Golden and Colorado landmark in 1993 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It is one of the rare moved buildings to have achieved such high designation, in recognition of its architecture. Architecture The unique design of the Quaintance Block has long defied simple explanation and has fascinated the preservation community for years. It is made of experimental glazed bricks from the United States Glazed Brick & Pottery works, which operated during the 1910s on far West 8th Street in Golden. It is one of only three known remaining buildings using these bricks (including the Maas Residence at 423 10th Street in Golden, and Union Station in downtown Denver), which were renowned in their time for their beauty and would not crack or craze. In overall design, the storefront is premodernist but features a pressed metal cornice looking back on earlier times, even ancient times with its Greek styling. However, its predominantly white walls and geometry look forward to art nouveau and modernist design, while its brickwork quoins complete the unusual design. The Quaintance Block was designed and constructed by architect James H. Gow, locally raised and educated at Jarvis Hall college.

It is one of the important commercial centres in Jaffna. The original name of the town was Mayilani.Yaalpaana Charithram by A.Mutthuthambipillai, p.123,Tamil Mann Publication In northern Sri Lanka, Chunnakam is only second to Jaffna in terms of population density and commercial activities in and around its neighbourhoods. Etymology According to Tamil scholars, Chunnakam derived from two Tamil words, \\"Chunnam+Gramam\\", \\"Chunnam\\" means limestone and \\"Gramam\\" means village, limestone is widely found in the nearby areas. One of the great Sri Lanka Tamil poets, Kumarasamy pulavar gave a new definition to its name in his poem beginning as ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æü‡Æø‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ ‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Øà ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æï‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Æ¥‡Æø ... , from which, scholars believe that the rising Sun from the East reflecting on the temple of Siva located on the present day station road, has the impression of seeing a shiny mountain, which is presumably the Heaven, the home of Lord Siva made him to inspire for the poem mentioned above here, ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç can be divided into two parts of nouns as ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ≤‡Øç + ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç = ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Ææ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç, where ‡Æö‡ØÅ‡Æ≤‡Øç means silver and ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç means mountain giving the compound noun the meaning as \\"Shiny Mountain\\" It was once suggested that the name Chunnakam was the equivalent of Pali name Cunnag√£ma (). But later suggested that the name may be the Tamil equivalent of the Sinhala name Sulun√£gama (Pali: Cullan√£gag√£ma). History Historically in the recent centuries Chunnakam has been an area dominated mostly by Sri Lankan Tamils and up until the 1980s there was a small Sinhalese population from the south along with Indian Tamils, Moors, and other South Indian Non-Tamils such as Malayalis lived in Chunnakam area. This ethnic diversity among its residents gave Chunnakam a characteristic of a major city. Location Chunnakam is about 5 miles2 in area as it has Punnalaikkadduvan on its East, Uduvil on its South, Sandilipay on its West and Mallakam on its north as bordering villages. Chunnakam has population of about 60,000. Transport *Chunnakam railway station Politics Currently Chunnakam is governed by Valikamam South Divisional Council. Unlike other places in Northern Sri Lanka, people of Chunnakam also adapted to diversive political beliefs. During the days of Town Council era, residents always preferred candidates from LSSP to Federal party or Tamil congress and in the 1982 presidential election, the then JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera collected majority votes within Manipay constituency from the two poll booths in Chunnakam only. There was even a popular rumor about Mr. Wijeweera being kept in a secret place in Chunnakam when he was wanted by the Sri Lankan government following the infamous uprising by his men in the late 80's. However, that turned out to be untrue as he was captured in a place in the central province.
