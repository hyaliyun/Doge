The series is named after Adolf Loos' 1910 lecture series Ornament and Crime, in which he equated ornamentation with the destruction of culture and society, and argued that only criminals and degenerates (including women) adorn themselves. Adolf Loos' writings were highly influential in the Modern Architecture movement and the Bauhaus.

The eastern section of Yarrah lies within the Flinders Ranges Council, while the western section lies in the Pastoral Unincorporated Area. History The traditional owners of the area are the Barngarla people.This name is one of the names used on the widely used Aboriginal Australia Map, by David Horton (ed.), 1994 published in The Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia by AIATSIS. This map also divides Australia into 18 regions (Southwest, Northwest, Desert, Kimberley, Fitzmaurice, North, Arnhem, Gulf, West Cape, Torres Strait, East, Rainforest, Northeast, Eyre, Riverine, Southeast, Spencer and Tasmania). The name 'Yarrah' is said to come from an Aboriginal word meaning \\"river red gum\\". A township at Yarrah, located along the railway line, was surveyed in April 1863 and offered for sale on 21 July 1864 South Australian Place Names. but was largely unsuccessful. The hundred of Yarrah was proclaimed on 16 December 1880 by Governor William Jervois. It was in the County of Newcastle. Yarrah Post Office opened on 1 October 1887 and closed around 1909. Yarrah Primary School opened in 1893. In about 1919, it closed because of small attendance, but then re-opened in 1919, only to be closed permanently at a later date. ‚ÄòThe little galvanised-iron church at Yarraville [sic]‚Äô is mentioned in the Register newspaper.Register 18 October 1924, page 11g. Wilkatana railway station was located in the west of the hundred of Yarrah, named after nearby Wilkatana Station. The Depot Creek railway station, further to the south within the hundred of Yarrah, existed for many years; however, Pacific National advised in 2013 that the station had been closed, although the line continues to be in use. The historic Depot Creek Weir is located at Yarrah, and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The weir dates from 1912 to 1917, when it was built as part of the supply infrastructure for the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie section of the Trans-Australian Railway; the underlying springs had earlier been used by explorer Edward John Eyre. The gazetted locality of Yarrah was created in November 1999. The locality's boundaries roughly equate to those of the hundred of Yarrah and approximately half of the adjacent hundred of Wyacca. In April 2013, an additional portion of formerly unincorporated land was added to the locality. In 2013, Australia Post altered the local postcode from 5713 to 5433 as part of a review of outback postcodes. Much of the 1950 film Bitter Springs, starring Chips Rafferty, was filmed at Yarrah.

In 1862 the Hull Corporation established a cemetery adjacent, now known as Western Cemetery, and in expanded the cemetery west across Chanterlands Avenue onto an adjacent site. The General Cemetery contains several notable monument and burials, including a monument to a cholera outbreak in 1849, as well as the graves of many notable persons of the Victoria era and early 20th century of Kingston upon Hull. The General Cemetery closed in 1972, the Western Cemetery is, as of 2018, still in use. In 2018 a community group of volunteers, The Friends of Hull General Cemetery, was formed and have taken on the challenge of caring for this heritage site of special natural interest. The group was formed as a subcommittee of the Hull Civic Society. It meets regularly at the Avenues Centre, Park Avenue, Hull. During its short life it has generated a significant amount of interest in the cemetery from the general public and plans are afoot to bid for local and national funding to make the cemetery a more hospitable place for the community to visit yet still retain its historical significance and environmental importance for future generations. In September 2018 a short introduction to the Hull General Cemetery 1847 ‚Äì 1972, was published by Pete Lowden and Bill Longbone History =Hull General Cemetery= Main cemetery entrance and railway level crossing, view from Spring Bank (, F.S. Smith) Hull General Cemetery Company was established in 1846, with a capital of 1,000 shares of ¬£10. The cemetery on Spring Bank was opened in 1847, for Anglican burials only, with the foundation stone of the cemetery's entrance lodge formally laid by the mayor, B.M. Jalland on 2 June. The ground was consecrated on 28 August 1847. In 1859 the foundation stone for the cemetery's chapel was laid, by the mayor, Martin Samuelson. The cemetery entrance was in a gothic revival style, consisting of three lodges and six large double gates; the original mortuary chapel was octagonal, a second chapel was later added exclusively for Anglican rites, and a third in 1863 for the use of non- conformists. At the time of its development the cemetery was in the parish of Cottingham, and on the outer fringes of the urban development of Hull.Ordnance Survey Sheet 240 1:1560 1853 In 1854 an act allowed incorporation of the company, and allowed it to expand. Intramural burial were abolished in Hull after 1856/7. In 1855 Quakers took a 999-year lease on a plot of ground within the cemetery. Several prominent Quakers were later buried in the ground including persons from the prominent local employers of the Reckitt, and Priestmann families. By 1864 the cemetery occupied around , and contained over 10,000 interments. The main gates were demolished in the early 20th century, and built over.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1910‚Äì11, 1928 The Hull General Cemetery went into receivership in the 1970s, and maintenance of the cemetery was taken over by Hull City Council. The final interment was in 1972, excluding the Quaker burial ground which had its last burial in 1974. The overgrown cemetery was cleared after being taken over by the council in 1972. The main gates, and all the chapels had been demolished by 1983. The Hull General Cemetery Company sought liquidation via the courts which it achieved in 1972 leaving the site without ownership. Eventually, after questions asked in Parliament the site was sold to Hull City Council for a nominal sum of ¬£1 in 1974. At the time the local press was calling the site an ‚Äòeyesore‚Äô and demanding that it was cleaned up. What the aims of the council were when it acquired the land initially is open to question and it could be argued the local authority was reacting to events rather than having a strategic goal for the site. However, within a short space of time the local authority made clear that the cemetery should be re-developed. There had been earlier demonstrations of cemetery ‚Äòre- development‚Äô in the city when Trippet Street, Division Road and the Drypool graveyards in the early 1960s and 70‚Äôs suffered this process. Redevelopment in this sense meant that the vast majority of headstones would be removed and the cemetery landscaped. This took the form of harrowing and grass seeding the ground so that it could be mown. Public opposition to this plan for Hull General Cemetery, including such names as Philip Larkin and John Betjeman, was overruled and the wholesale destruction of irreparable historical artefacts took place. The whole process took about 18 months. However, because of Hull General Cemetery‚Äôs conspicuous role in Victorian Hull, a number of headstones, principally of more notable members of the public, were allowed to remain. Also, as an indication of how ‚Äòbad‚Äô the cemetery had become until the council stepped in, a number of rows of headstones were left in situ. These are the rows next to and surrounding the Quaker plot. By 1979 the site had been ‚Äòdeveloped‚Äô. At first the council maintained the grounds. Grass cutting took place on a regular basis and paths were re-laid every year with sand and gravel. The council maintained the trees. The cemetery resembled a park with headstones dotted around. Children played there, families picnicked and dogs were walked. Apart from the headstones, the cemetery may well have been, to a casual observer, either West Park or Pearson Park. Unfortunately, over time, with the council suffering significant funding cuts, the maintenance of the cemetery fell by the wayside and it began to acquire a neglected feel. The dumping of rubbish began to happen more regularly, paths became quagmires; sycamore saplings began to destroy the remaining stones whilst ivy swamped them. The entire cemetery was quickly becoming a place to avoid rather than to visit. With the formation of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery in 2018 unpaid volunteers began to address the neglect of the Cemetery and thoughtfully, carefully and sensitively began to reclaim the cemetery and began encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife and also to encourage local residents to enjoy the diversity the Cemetery has to offer. As a result the Hull General Cemetery woke from its slumber in 2018 and started to come alive and the undesirables left to leave it an oasis of tranquillity almost in the very heart of the city. The hard work of the Friends of Hull General Cemetery has brought enjoyment and relaxation to so many people ... many of whom have lived near to but avoided the cemetery because of the what it had deteriorated to but now look at it with loving eyes. Wildlife has started to return to the cemetery and The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are mindful to of the need to strike a balance between the needs of the flora and fauna and also the needs of the public to enjoy been able to escape an inner city environment and step into an 'ancient' woodland. To this end the original objectives of Friends of Hull General Cemetery (to be achieved by working in close consultation with the land owners, Hull City Council) are as follows‚Ä¶ * Landscape and Woodland Management: To employ sustainable, multi-objective woodland management to preserve and improve the important function of the mature, broadleaved woodland on the site in the urban landscape. * Social History: To conserve the burial monuments and associated features in their woodland setting and to encourage their interpretation and appreciation. * Education: To encourage the educational use of the area, including its use as a local nature-site and its use to engage the local community in the Hull Biodiversity Action Plan process. * Access, Recreation and Inclusion: To ensure that the open, public-access to the site is maintained, that it is safe and welcoming to everyone and wherein the formal path network is well managed and accessible to all. * Biodiversity: To conserve and enhance the flora and fauna at the site, their habitats and diversity, including protected species. * Community Involvement: To enable the engagement of the local community in the active management of the site. * Safety and Public Amenity: To ensure the site is maintained in a safe condition and manner. * Implementation, Funding and Partnerships: To set out a programme of implementation for the practical and administrative management of the proposed project which identifies responsibilities, costs and potential means of funding the management of the site, including possible community and voluntary sector partners to work with the City Council.

That it has been abused, neglected and damaged by its custodians is not in doubt but it still breathes charm and exudes magic. Walking there, within 100 yards of a major thoroughfare, one can forget the modern world. The Friends of Hull General Cemetery are actively working to create an oasis for the community in the heart of the city. The Friends of Hull General Cemetery Facebook group was formed to promote and celebrate the unique historical and environmental attributes of the cemetery. It is the ‚ÄòFriends‚Äô intention to try and turn this long-overgrown and disused burial ground into a place which can once more be enjoyed by all in the local neighbourhood. The 'Friends' hope to achieve this over time by clearing-up the graves and headstones, by encouraging the diversity of flora and wildlife, by promoting historical research, and most importantly of all by getting and keeping local people and organisations involved in its upkeep. The goals of the 'Friends' could never be achievable without the input of time, energy and ideas by its members and volunteers who throughout the years (and whatever the weather) make themselves available to help in the upkeep and ongoing improvements of the cemetery and its overall environment.

It is one of the most famous manuscripts of the Shahnameh, dating from 1648. The painters are Muhammad Qasim and Muhammad Yusuf.

Harold Kreis (left) in October 2014  Playing career  Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Kreis played junior ice hockey for the Kildonan North Stars and Calgary Wranglers in the 1970s. Kreis signed with Mannheimer ERC of Germany at the age of 19 in 1978. At the time, the club was looking for Canadian players of German descent, who were eligible for a German passport, because the number of foreign players per team was restricted in the German league. He would stay with the club until the end of his playing career in 1997. A longtime captain of the Mannheim team, Kreis won German championships in 1980 and 1997, he played a total of 891 games for the club. After coming over to Germany, Kreis was also selected to represent the West German national teams internationally. In the course of his career, he won 180 caps for West Germany, playing in the 1984 and 1988 Olympic Games and eight World Championships. He also represented West Germany at the 1979 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.  Coaching career  Kreis joined the Mannheim coaching staff as an assistant after retiring as a player in 1997 and helped guide the team to German championships in 1998 and 1999. In November 1999, he was hired for his first head coach position, as he took over second-division side EC Bad Nauheim. After a stint as assistant coach with K√∂lner Haie in 2000-01, Kreis returned to Bad Nauheim and remained in the job until February 2002. He signed with HC Davos of the National League A (NLA), the top-tier of Swiss ice hockey, for the 2002-03 season, serving as assistant coach on the club‚Äôs men‚Äôs team and head coach of the junior squad.

Lugano was down 0-2 in the quarterfinals, when Kreis took over and guided the team to the title. This was later called the \\"most amazing comeback in Swiss playoff history\\". He won more silverware in 2008, when he captured his second Swiss championship title, this time with the ZSC Lions. Following the championship season and a two-year tenure in Zurich, the DEG Metro Stars of the German top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga appointed Kreis head coach in 2008. Under his guidance, DEG reached the DEL finals in 2009. In March 2010, he was sacked after a streak of eight losses in eleven games and after it was published that Kreis had signed a contract as head coach of fellow DEL side Adler Mannheim for the following season. His coaching tenure with Mannheim lasted three and a half years and included a DEL finals appearance in 2012. In January 2014, Kreis and the Adler organization parted company by mutual consent after a 0-5 loss to Wolfsburg. In March 2014, Kreis agreed on a two- year deal with Swiss NLA team EV Zug and was handed a contract extension until 2017 in September 2015. In the 2016-17 season, he steered Zug to the NLA finals where they fell 2-4 to Bern. In April 2017, Kreis signed a fresh two- year contract with the EVZ organization. In the 2017-18 campaign, Kreis led EVZ to a second-place finish in the regular season before losing in the playoff quarterfinals.

It is the oldest surviving illustrated manuscript of the Shahnameh, probably dating to the 1330s, and in its original form, which has not been recorded, was probably planned to consist of about 280 folios with 190 illustrations, bound in two volumes, although it is thought it was never completed.Carboni and Adamjee; Blair & Bloom, 28 It is the largest early book in the tradition of the Persian miniature,Hillenbrand, 155; it is slightly larger than the copies of the Jami' al-tawarikh or Compendium of Chronicles of a few decades earlier. in which it is \\"the most magnificent manuscript of the fourteenth century\\",Blair & Bloom, 28 \\"supremely ambitious, almost awe-inspiring\\",Sims, 277 and \\"has received almost universal acclaim for the emotional intensity, eclectic style, artistic mastery and grandeur of its illustrations\\".Canby, 33‚Äì34 Mourning the dead Iskandar (Alexander the Great), Freer Gallery of Art It was produced in the context of the Il-khanid court ruling Persia as part of the Mongol Empire, about a century after their conquest, and just as the dynasty was about to collapse. It remained in Persia until the early 20th century, when it was broken up in Europe by the dealer George Demotte, and now exists as 57 individual pages, many significantly tampered with, in a number of collections around the world.Iranica Miniatures Like other Persian manuscripts, it uses paper. Excluding blank margins, the pages are 41 by 29 cm, with the text in six columns of 31 lines where not interrupted by the miniatures. These mostly take the full width of the page, and are placed at various heights within it. None are full page. Some miniatures use irregular \\"stepped\\" shapes to suit the subject.Blair & Bloom, 28‚Äì30 Given the history of the manuscript (see below), the usual system of numbering by folios cannot be applied. The style, technique and artistic quality of the miniatures are highly variable; it has been suggested that different artists were responsible for them, but attempts to assign the miniatures to different hands have not achieved consensus. There seems to be experimentation in several respects. Some miniatures are paintings in ink lines and coloured washes, others use opaque watercolour, in a range of palettes. Some pigments have not lasted well. The miniatures have elements derived from both Chinese and (less often) Western traditions; for example the mourners of Iskandar draw from Christian depictions of the Lamentation of Christ, and reminiscences of several other standard scenes from the Life of Christ in art appear in other miniatures.Hillenbrand, 162‚Äì165; Blair & Bloom, 30; Canby, 34 Even costumes are highly variable: 37 styles of hat have been found, and 8 of lapels.Blair & Bloom, 30 Iskandar (Alexander the Great) at the Talking Tree, which foretells his death. Freer From the vast range of potential moments to illustrate in the Shahnameh, and even allowing for the limited proportion that have survived, the illustrations show unusual choices. The story of Iskandar, a Persianized version of Alexander the Great, is very heavily illustrated, while the longer story of Rustam much less so.Blair & Bloom, 30 Themes given emphasis by the choices of what to illustrate include \\"the enthronement of minor kings, dynastic legitimacy, and the role of women as kingmakers\\", as well as scenes of murder and mourning.Canby, 34; Titley, 22; Grove, 202 These choices are usually taken as reflecting contemporary political events,Blair & Bloom, 30; Canby, 34 including \\"tensions between the Il-khanid dynasty and Persian subjects\\",Iranica and the Black Death, which was ravaging Persia in these years. They have been described as \\"often doom-laden\\".Titley, 22 Borrowings from Chinese art, in the shape of gnarled trees, round-topped wave-like rocks and tightly curling strips of cloud, dominate the landscapes and skies.Titley, 22‚Äì24; Canby, 34 In many images, large main figures dominate the composition in a way unusual in Persian miniatures, though common in the West. In Chinese art, there were large main figures, but these were not combined with landscape painting, as they are here.Hillenbrand, 165 The display of emotion by figures is also unusual;Grove, 216‚Äì217; Iranica the convention for depicting grief is borrowed from Christian art.Hillenbrand, 165 Kings often have halos. As regards their shape, 29 are horizontal rectangles, 8 vertical ones, and 12 squares, giving a total of 49 rectangular images. Stepped images total nine, with 5 symmetrical and four not (so 58 in total).Sims, 275 Background The Shahnameh, an epic poem of about 60,000 couplets, was completed in 1010 by Ferdowsi. It covers the pre-Islamic history of Persia, beginning in pure legend, but by the final Sassanid kings giving a reasonable accurate historical account, mixed in with romantic stories. It represented an assertion of Persian national identity,Hillenbrand, 154 begun during the Iranian Intermezzo after the Arab Abbasid Caliphate had lost effective control of Persia. By the time it was finished the Turkic Ghaznavids had taken over. The Mongol Empire had begun to conquer Persia in 1219, and completed it in the 1250s, founding the sub-dynasty and state known as the Ilkhanate, which as well as Persia included modern Iraq and parts of Afghanistan, Turkey and several other countries (especially parts of the former Soviet Union).Titley, 17 The Mongols initially mostly continued a nomadic lifestyle and lived separately from their Persian subjects, but increasingly settled in Persian cities and developed an understanding of Persianate culture, as well as converting to Islam, which happened rapidly, at least among the elite, after the newly-converted Ghazan reached the throne in 1295.Hillenbrand, 135 However, the Mongols remained largely culturally distinct at the time the Great Mongol Shahnameh was created. The death of the hero Rustam and his horse Rakhsh; as he dies Rustam shoots his treacherous brother through the tree he hides behind, British Museum Tiles with verses from the Shahnameh have been found in a Mongol palace, dating from about 1280. It is clear from literary references that there was a pre-Islamic tradition of illustrating stories later included in the Shahnameh in wall-paintings and probably other media,Titley, 22; Canby, 30 and some Islamic ceramics may well show such scenes. But there are no survivals, or mentions, of illustrated books of the Shahnameh before the 14th century, and the ten surviving manuscripts from between 1300 and 1350 all appear to have been produced for Mongols.Hillenbrand, 150; The Florence Shahnameh, the oldest text-only manuscript to survive, dates to 1217 Possibly a relative unfamiliarity with the Persian language and the text may have encouraged adding pictures.Canby, 30 These include three \\"small\\" Shahnamehs, perhaps the earliest, whose small size (text and image area of 250 x 170 mm in a typical example) may have suited nomadic owners, and four manuscripts for the semi-independent Injuid rulers of Shiraz and Isfahan in the south-west. This latter group, probably all later than the Great Mongol Shahnameh, are influenced by it, though much less complex in style.Discussed at length by Sims; Grove; Canby, 34‚Äì38; Titley, 38‚Äì39 The books had a political purpose, which is reflected in the choice of incidents to illustrate: \\"in such works, the hitherto stubbornly alien rulers of Iran were expressing a new and public commitment to the religion and cultural heritage of the very lands that they themselves had devastated some two generations previously‚Äîand doing so with an urgency that suggested they were making up for lost time.\\"Hillenbrand, 137 In the first decade of the 13th century the Persian Jewish vizier, Ra≈°ƒ´d-al-Dƒ´n was commissioned by Ghazan to continue a history of the Mongols, which he completed in 1307, and the next khan √ñljait√º ordered a world history, the Jami' al-tawarikh, the earliest manuscript of which also dates to 1307.Canby, 31; Blair & Bloom, 26‚Äì28 Ra≈°ƒ´d-al-Dƒ´n set up a scriptorium in the Tabriz suburb of Rab'-e Rashidi, where the book was researched, scribed, illustrated and bound. The intention was to produce two illustrated manuscript copies each year, one in Persian and one in Arabic, for distribution around the empire; parts of three of these survive, as well as parts of other books from the workshop. They are illustrated in a fairly consistent style, which the Great Mongol Shahnameh builds on and significantly develops.Grove (fullest); Canby, 31‚Äì32; Blair & Bloom, 26‚Äì28; Titley, 18‚Äì19 After Ra≈°ƒ´d-al-Dƒ´n was executed in 1318 the workshop declined or ceased, but his son ·∏†ƒ´ƒÅ·πØ-al-Dƒ´n Mo·∏•ammad revived it when he rose in the court in the 1330s, and the Great Mongol Shahnameh is assumed to have been created there.Grove; Canby, 34 History Any colophon with details of when the work was produced and who commissioned it, which many Persian manuscripts have, has been lost. The work has always been located to Tabriz in the late Il-khanid period, and was clearly a massive project commissioned by someone important in the court, probably with the ruler as the ultimate recipient, either through a gift or a delegated commission. Recent studies of the manuscript have been dominated by the conclusions reached at a seminar at Harvard in 1975, published in 1980 by Oleg Grabar and Sheila Blair (see Further reading below).Sims, 276 This proposed a short period of creation, with the start of work very precisely dated to \\"between November 1335 and May 1336\\",Sims, 276 and a commission by Ra≈°ƒ´d-al-Dƒ´n‚Äôs son ·∏†ƒ´ƒÅ·πØ-al- Dƒ´n Mo·∏•ammad, with work on the manuscript probably brought to an end by his murder in May 1336. Both these points have been generally accepted, though the lack of evidence for either has been noted, and in particular some scholars favour a period of creation stretching over a much longer period.Sims, 277 (see also David Morgan, p. 429-430, in the same volume); Blair & Bloom, 28; Iranica The main alternative initial patron proposed has been the last of the main line of Ilkhanid rulers, Abu Sa'id,Ekhtiar, Maryam, Sheila R. Canby, Navina Haidar, and Priscilla P. Soucek, ed., Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2011, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, no. 57, pp. 89, 96‚Äì97, ill. p. 96, online at MMA, in \\"Catalogue entry\\" who died in 1335, as did his sons, all apparently of the plague, so precipitating the splitting of the Ilkhanate into small states. If this was the case, ·∏†ƒ´ƒÅ·πØ-al-Dƒ´n Mo·∏•ammad might very well have still been responsible for fulfilling the commission. Enthroned ruler, Louvre The miniaturist Dust Muhammad wrote a history of Persian painting in about 1544,Titley, 22 over 200 years later, in which he refers to an important royal Shahnameh, which he describes as \\"square\\" in format,Canby, 33 which the Great Mongol Shahnameh is not. Nevertheless, many scholars have thought he was describing the Great Mongol Shahnameh. Dust Muhammad traced the style of painting used in his day to a painter called Ahman Musa,Blair & Bloom, 30‚Äì31 and described the Shahnameh as produced by a pupil of his, called Shamsuddin, for Shaikh Awais Jalayir, a ruler of the Jalayirid dynasty reigning 1356‚Äì74.Canby, 33 If the period of creation was in fact protracted, this account might refer to the later stages of work. The manuscript seems to have remained in Tabriz until the early 16th century, if not later,Blair & Bloom, 28 and then at some point entered the main library of the shahs, where it was photographed in the late 19th century, still bound.Canby, 33; Iranica:\\"The manuscript is thought to have belonged to the Qajar royal library, for it was photographed while still bound ... by Antoin Sevrugin, court photographer to the rulers NƒÅ·π£er-al-Dƒ´n Shah (1264-1313/1848-96) and Mo·∫ìaffar-al-Dƒ´n Shah (1313-24/1896-1907 ...). Mo·∏•ammad- øAlƒ´ Shah (1324-27/1907-09) and members of his household are said to have been selling manuscripts from the dynastic collection as early as 1908, in order to meet personal expenses.\\" It was once kept in Golestan Palace but it first appeared in Europe with Georges Demotte, a Belgian art dealer active from 1900‚Äì23 in Paris: \\"Demotte is said to have acquired the manuscript in Paris in about 1910; he bought it from Shemavan Malayan, brother-in-law of the well-known dealer Hagop Kevorkian, who had brought it from Tehran\\".Iranica Demotte failed to raise the price he wanted for the whole manuscript from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other potential buyers. He then separated the miniatures and sold them, after various physical interventions to increase the sale value, and without properly recording the original form of the book. Pages were pulled apart to give two sides with miniatures, and to disguise this and the resulting damage, calligraphers were hired to add new text, often from the wrong part of the work, as Demotte did not expect his new clientele of wealthy collectors to be able to read Persian.Iranica This has left the subject of some miniatures still uncertain, as the surrounding text does not match them.\\"Nushirvan Eating Food Brought by the Sons of Mahbud\\", Folio from a Shahnama (Book of Kings), Metropolitan Museum of Art; see commentary Scholars have been very critical of the \\"infamous\\" Demotte,Grove, 216 and it irked many that the manuscript he treated so brutally carried his name, so the new name of \\"Great Mongol Shahnameh\\" was promoted, and has generally won acceptance. Currently, 57 miniatures from this manuscript have been identified in museums around the world,Carboni and Adamjee; but Blair & Bloom and Iranica say 58; apparently one was destroyed in 1937, see Sims, 274, in note including the Freer Gallery of Art, which has the largest group at 16 pages,Freer/Smithsonian page; technically some are Freer Gallery, others Sackler Gallery the Louvre (2), British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art (2), and museums in Dublin (7), Berlin, Boston (2), Cleveland,Bahram Gur Slays a Dragon, Cleveland Museum of Art Detroit, Montreal, and other cities, as well as private collections including the Khalili Collections.

The film is written and directed by Matt Drummond and co-produced by Jason Moody and Megan Williams. It focuses on an island where a special kind of crystal acts as a portal that can bring different things from different times on the island. The film was inspired by a conversation between Drummond and American film producer Paul Mason while both were living on the South Pacific Island of Vanuatu. Journey to Dinosaur Island has also been called the first feature film to depict a feathered Tyrannosaurus. Plot Lucas, a 13-year-old boy, visits his grandmother's old house which is now set 'for sale'. There, while exploring bookshelf, he finds a crystal enclosed in a box. Amused, he takes it with him. The adventure begins when, in his plane, he moves the crystal onto the next empty seat and it shines. A disaster strikes the plane and Lucas finds himself stranded in a strange land littered with ghost ships and prehistoric creatures. While searching for other signs of life, Lucas hears a radio broadcast in the distance and is drawn into the jungle, where he encounters a beautiful young girl Kate, who claims to have come from the 1950s. He learns from her that Kate also used to possess a similar crystal like the one with Lucas. She gives him her diary which she denotes as ‚ÄòSurvival Guide‚Äô for Lucas. He also meets a Sinornithosaurus whom Kate named Mimos. Mimos was able to imitate any sound he heard. At a minor earthquake, Lucas learns that mists arrives with earthquakes and bring airplanes, like the one in which Lucas arrived, from different time including past and even future. The airplanes are always empty but bring many useful things. When another airplane arrives, Lucas and Kate leave to explore it. At the same moment, some tribal people attack the plane and capture the duo. On their way they face gigantic Pitcher Plants(Nepenthes) and Venus Flytraps . On reaching the village, they are put into a pyramid-shaped wooden jail. There, Lucas meets another prisoner who when sees the crystal in Lucas's hand, gets surprised and call it a ‚Äòsing sing stone‚Äô. He whistles and because of it, a mist forms over the crystal. This mist brings things from time. He says that these stone are present in larger form between the twin volcanoes and they are responsible for forming the mist and bringing planes on that island. Lucas concludes that it is a massive piezoelectric crystal cluster which attains its resonant frequency due to seismic activities and creates the portal which can also help him to get back home. He and Kate, together escape through an opening at the top. Kate frees some large pterosaurs, one of which gives them a ride towards the volcano twins although they have a bad landing. When a Tyrannosaurus chases them, Mimos imitates the roar and scare him away. Again some dromaeosaurs chase after them but they make their way to the middle of the volcanic twins. Upon reaching the destination, Lucas uses a jar and fills it with water. He creates the sound required to energise the crystals. Suddenly, one of the dromaeosaurs enters and catches Mimos. However they manage to beat him but lose their jar. Mimos suddenly wakes up, imitates the jar singing and fly away. The crystals start creating the portal. But Kate says that she will not go back without her diary, which was lying in a stone cavity. She insists that without proof the world will not believe her and Lucas must go into the portal as she will be right behind him. Lucas proceeds. He wakes up in a hospital, and hears the news about the mysterious island. Soon he meets his grandma, Kathryn, who says she prefers Kate as Kathryn is so old fashioned. It is revealed that she is actually Kate whom Lucas met at the island. With the proofs of her diary, she receives Nobel Prize Award for Science and the film ends.

In the vein of Kiss: the Remix, both Japan exclusives, Emotion Remixed + compiles eight remixes of singles released from her third studio album Emotion (2015), and two new tracks: \\"First Time\\" and \\"Fever\\". The compilation features contributions by Bleachers, the Knocks and a cohort of collaborators from her Emotion sessions. Remixed + charted at number 256 in Japan. \\"First Time\\" was given a limited promotional release. The new songs were subsequently included on Jepsen's companion release Emotion: Side B (2016); and were given a second Japanese release through the country's exclusive reissue of the EP in 2017. Remixed + was primarily supported by Jepsen's two headlining performances at Popspring 2016 in Tokyo and Kobe.  Background and release  The new renditions on Emotion Remixed + were previously released throughout 2015, several as a part of the original singles' accompanying remix packages. The compilation features contributions from returning musicians and future collaborators. Jepsen worked with Jack Antonoff during the production process of Emotion, though his contributions did not make the final cut. Antonoff's remix of \\"I Really Like You\\", released under his Bleachers moniker, premiered through Stereogum on July 9, 2015; following the blog's exclusive Blasterjaxx remix earlier that April. Jepsen would later contribute to the Bleachers cover album Terrible Thrills, Vol. 2, before lending her vocals to a collaboration on Gone Now (2017). The Y2K \\"Run Away with Me\\" remix made its Idolator premiere on August 12, 2015. The Knocks' rendition of \\"All That\\" was originally a \\"technically illegal\\" bootleg posted to Soundcloud on April 17, 2015; the pair stated that Jepsen's fondness for the remix gave it an official release. Jepsen would later feature on their debut album 55 (2016). Skylar Spence previously remixed Jepsen's \\"Call Me Maybe\\" in 2012, under the name Saint Pepsi, before being commissioned for \\"Your Type\\". It was given an exclusive Billboard debut on December 18, 2015. Universal Music Japan announced Emotion Remixed + on February 16, 2016, in commemoration of the first Popspring festival later that April, where Jepsen was set to headline. Her appearance was announced two months prior. The release was billed as a \\"special present\\" from Carly to her Japanese fans, though speaking to the Japan Times, the album gave Jepsen an opportunity to \\"present her music in another context\\" as well. Emotion Remixed + features two then-unreleased songs, \\"First Time\\" and \\"Fever\\", which were in the running for inclusion on the parent album‚Äìultimately left off due to time constraints: \\"They‚Äôre still just as important to me as the songs on Emotion, so it was a great opportunity to put out this remix album and add something new and two of my favorite songs from this cycle.\\" Remixed + was released as a standard jewel case, featuring a sticker of the album artwork and a CD booklet that folds out as a mini poster. The album's photography was done by Hazel and Pine. In addition to her Popspring performances, Jepsen appeared on the March 31, 2016, broadcast of the HTB Ichioshi! Morning („Ç§„ÉÅ„Ç™„Ç∑ÔºÅ„É¢„Éº„Éã„É≥„Ç∞) show.  Composition  \\"First Time\\" was co-penned with Rami Yacoub, Carl Falk and Wayne Hector; its production handled by the former two. The song was conceived during the same sessions as \\"Your Type\\". \\"Fever\\" was written with Kyle Shearer, Nate Campany and Saul Alexander Castillo Vasquez, and produced solely by Shearer. Its co- writers have contributed to several of Jepsen's Emotion offerings. Y2K called \\"Run Away with Me\\" one of their favorite pop songs of 2015, their treatment gives it a \\"sweeping electro overhaul\\" with marching band beats. Its intro is reminiscent of the Japanese stringed instrument koto. Skylar Spence's \\"slick and airy\\", \\"warped disco\\" rework of \\"Your Type\\" is noted by Spins Colin Joyce as utilizing \\"cut up samples and disorienting modulation\\". The song takes an \\"airier, more glittery approach\\" through the Young Bombs remix. Blasterjaxx casts \\"I Really Like You\\" in \\"darker, more grown up tones\\" with a \\"thumping electronic exoskeleton\\". The Bleachers remix is noted for Antonoff's signature \\"staccato touches\\" and a layering of marching drums. Its \\"sweeping synths\\" depart from the original's bubblegum-pop for a \\"charming '80s-inspired groove\\" as opined by Bianca Gracie of Idolator. The Bleachers remix was listed in Eliza Thompson's \\"5 Songs You Need to Hear This Week\\" for Cosmopolitan, calling its '80s sheen \\"dreamy\\". The Knocks' transform \\"All That\\" into a \\"pulsating house anthem\\" as opined by Bustles Alex Kritselis, whereas Gracie calls it a \\"modern disco groove\\".  Commercial performance  This album debuted at number 256 on the Oricon Weekly Albums chart, becoming her lowest charting album in the country to date.

Masmundari is a prominent Damar Kurung artist. History Damar Kurung is a Gresik Muslim tradition to welcome Laylat al- Qadr in the month of Ramadan in the Islamic calendar. As part of the tradition, the lanterns are hung on resin brackets in front of the house. Initially, the resin brackets were crafted only by the Masmundari family circle, until the Damar Festival in 2012, when several companies began mass production. Design Damar lanterns are traditionally cubical with lined paper, featuring a two-dimensional image usually referencing Indonesian culture. Damar Kurung can also be made with fiberglass, so they don't get damaged during rainy season. Damar lanterns are usually ornamented, that may reflect specific festivals or celebrations. The rules to make Damar Kurung lamps include: * Each side of a damarkurung must have two or three sequences, top to bottom. All four sides should have the same number of sequences. * The paintings are two dimensional. * Outdoor stories are represented by tree pictures. * Indoor stories are represented by roof pictures. * Wind directions are represented by arrows. * Conversations between figures are represented by three dots that are arranged as triangles. * The allowed colors are green, blue, red and yellow. * Paints are water colors or acrylics. * Stories are either sacred or profane. * The reading of damarkurung stories begins from the sacred, then the damarkurung is turned to the left and read from top to bottom. This is similar to the readable reliefs in temples in East Java. Development Damar lanterns include many developments, such as resin brackets made of mica acrylic, painting berfigura, bedside lamps, architectural building-elements and designs on a shirt. A resin brackets festival began in 2012 aimed at Meningatkan society to restore the tradition. Thousands of resin brackets are typically lit in Gresik and the younger generation are educated in the practice, commonly called Pesantren resin brackets.

The libretto is by Mordechai Tabib. A first version was commissioned by Sara Levi-Tanai for her Inbal Dance Theater company performed in 1957. The concert oratorio version premiered on 17 July 1963 to open the third annual Israel Festival. The conductor was Gary Bertini, who conducted all performances except one until his death in 2005.Ronit Seter, \\"Mordecai Seter,\\" in Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 February 2016Ronit Seter, \\"Nationalism in Jewish-Israeli Art Music, 1940-2000,\\" Ph.D. dissertation, 2004 Synopsis Midnight Vigil is a roughly forty-minute monodrama, its action consisting of visions experienced by a lone worshipper who prays all night in a synagogue. The worshipper, portrayed by the tenor, has several visions over the course of the work: the Diaspora, the High Priest in the Temple, Jacob's Dream, and a Halleluja. When morning comes, the congregation enters, speaking the prayer Adonai sefatai tifta·∏• in nine-part canon. The three choirs represent, respectively, the Heavenly Voice, the Legend, and the People. Musical Materials The oratorio's striking drama, power, and coherence derive from Seter's mastery of polyphonic technique, his sure and original orchestration, and his consistent use‚Äîwith expert balance between repetition and variation‚Äîof an intricately linked network of musical materials. These include (1) a \\"lament\\" motive, consisting of a descending minor second; (2) a \\"hope\\" motive, consisting of an ascending major second; (3) a twelve-note scale consisting exclusively of half-steps and augmented seconds; and (4) the Yemenite paraliturgical melodies Ahavat hadasa and Elohim esh 'ala. Earlier versions Seter worked on Midnight Vigil from 1956 through 1961, and made small revisions even later, in 1978 and 1984, on the occasion of specific performances. Before the oratorio version's 1963 premiere, four preliminary versions were performed. The first, in 1957, was danced by the Inbal company. This ten- to twelve-minute work was scored for baritone soloist and a small chamber ensemble, with two-part chorus sections to be sung by the dancers. Seter next produced a second version, \\"Rhapsody on Yemenite Themes\\" for symphony orchestra, completed in 1958, for orchestra alone (14 minutes long), followed by a third, a \\"Rhapsody on Yemenite Themes\\"for soloists, choir and symphony orchestra, in 1959. The work's fourth version, a radiophonic oratorio (1960) was similar to the fifth and final one, 30 minutes in length and scored for baritone, narrator, three choirs, and orchestra. A twist, however, is that radiophonic effects applied to the choirs in post-production rendered this version of Midnight Vigil a recording-only experience. This version won the Prix Italia for a radiophonic work in 1962; it had been prepared for just this competition. The radiophonic version further occasioned the first stereophonic radio broadcast in Israel. It was aired on two different channels simultaneously, and listeners tuned in on two receivers for the full effect. Reception Midnight Vigil is regarded as one of the most important Israeli works, and was paired with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's Millennium Festival program of 1 January 2000.

He founded the senior Muslim branch of the Han family of Lasem, a branch that became part of the Javanese priyayi, or aristocracy, and distinguished itself in the history of East Java. Han Tjien Kong was born in 1720 at Lasem, a port city in Central Java, to Han Siong Kong (1672 ‚Äì 1743), a Chinese migrant of ancient lineage, and an unnamed mother of at least part-native ancestry. He had four brothers, including the younger Han Bwee Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen (1727 ‚Äì 1778). Han Tjien Kong converted to Islam at an unknown date, and subsequently assumed the Javanese name of Soero Pernollo. Sometime in the mid-eighteenth century, Soero Pernollo moved to East Java, at the time still a frontier territory contested by the Dutch East India Company, the Mataram Sultanate and the Balinese princely state of Mengwi. He entered the service of Hendrik Breton, a senior official of the Company. Breton held the post of Resident of Rembang, and was promoted in 1763 to Opperhofd van den Osthoek, or 'High Head of the Eastern Salient', before his eventual elevation in 1768 to the powerful Raad van Indi√´. Throughout this period, Soero Pernollo was Breton's right-hand man, initially as gezaghebber, or overseer, of three merchant ships, then as harbourmaster of Surabaya, the most important commercial entrep√¥t in East Java. During the consolidation of Dutch rule in the Eastern Salient, Soero Pernollo was appointed politiehoofd, or police chief, of Besuki and Panarukan in 1764 with the Javanese noble title of Ngabehi. In this capacity, he played an important role as a source of military intelligence for the Company during the Dutch-Blambangan War of 1767 to 1768. It was thanks to his influence that his younger brother, Kapitein Han Bwee Kong, eventually managed to acquire the lease for the districts of Besuki in 1768, and of Panarukan in 1777. Soero Pernollo died in 1776, but his two sons, Adipati Soero Adinegoro and Raden Soero Adiwikromo, both attained prominence as government officials, particularly during the French and British interludes in the Dutch East Indies (1806 ‚Äì 1815). One of his daughters married a fellow ally of the Dutch East India Company, Pakunataningrat I, Sultan of Sumenep (reigned 1812 - 1854). Their descendants continued to play an important role in the colonial administration of East Java.

The first record is dated only 1526. At that time there was a large estate owned by the Radziwills. Over the centuries Zembin belonged to a number of eminent szlachta dynasties. The prosperity of Zembin was in the 16th century. At that time it had a township status. From the middle of the 17th century because of the war and its consequences Zembin endured decay. Battles during the Great Northern War did not touch the township, though a long dislocation of a Moscow host headed by A. Menshikov here resulted in utter ruin. For that reason Zembin lost the status of a township. As of 1777 there were 38 homesteads, an inn, a brew-house and 2 watermills. The year 1783 marked a watershed in the history of Zembin. The then its owner Khreptovich returned the settlement the status of a township and invited to settle all free people and provided favourable conditions for trading. The Jews henceforth settled in Zembin, and its began to develop quickly. =Under the Russian Empire= As a result of the Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1793) Zembin became a part of the Russian Empire in Borisovsky Uyezd. The new authorities dispossessed Iokhim Khreptovich of his township but in 1807 returned it to his son Irinei. In 1795 a post office was opened in Zembin. There were 4 postmen and 8 horses. During the war of 1812 Napoleon spent here the first night after the tragic crossing the river Berezina. A badly wounded French general made his confession in church. He died and was buried in Zembin. The war between the Russian Empire and France, later the uprisings of the 19th century prevented the township from developing. Before 1800 there were 52 homesteads, in 1864 there were only 50. In later years Zembin grew quickly. In 1880 there were already 635 inhabitants and 139 homesteads (101 of them belonged to the Jews). The township became the administrative centre of a volost. As of 1890 it consisted of 124 populated localities with total population 9209. As of 1908 in Zembin there were 1189 inhabitants. It a quarter greater than of today total population. There was a watermill, 4 smithies, a school,23 shops, a hospital 3 taverns and 5 inns. During the First World War, between February and December 1918 the township was occupied by German troops. =Soviet period and present time= In 1919 Zembin was included into the BSSR, in 1927 lost the district center status, which it had received three years earlier. As of 1926 Zembin was inhabited by 1199 people, 838 of them were the Jews. There was a sewing workshop, a shoe-repair shop, 2 joinery shops, 3 tanneries, 5 smithies, a stream-meals, 2 bakeries, 2 oil-mills. 27 September 1933 the status of the place was reduced to a village. During the Second World War from July 1941 till 30 June 1944 Zembin was under German occupation. In July 1941 Nazis set up Zembin ghetto, situated next to Jewish cemetery in The Workers' and Peasants' Street (now Izzy Kharik). 18 August 1941 as a result of mass executions of 927 Jews Zembin ghetto was liquidated.

It is an open shrub with light-coloured new foliage, broad leaves and deep purple-violet flowers. Description Eremophila muelleriana is an erect, open shrub which grows to a height of between with branches and leaves covered by a layer of yellow or grey, branched hairs. The leaves are egg-shaped to almost circular, mostly long, wide and taper to a stalk which is about long. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on straight, hairy stalks mostly long. There are 5, green to purple, elliptic to lance-shaped, hairy sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petals are deep purple to reddish violet on the outside and white, sometimes with purple spots on the lower part of the inside. The outside of petal tube and lobes is hairy while the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to October and the fruits which follow are oval to cone-shaped, glabrous and about long. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila muelleriana was first formally described in 1934 by Charles Gardner from a specimen collected near Kalli, west of Cue. The description was published in Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (muelleriana) honours Ferdinand von Mueller. Distribution and habitat Round-leaved eremophila is only found in a small area north-east of Meekatharra, between Mount Narryer and Yalgoo in the Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions where it grows clay-sand in mulga woodland. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture This eremophila is a particularly striking plant in flower with its deep purple to almost black flowers and it is an attractive and hardy plant in a container. Propagation from cuttings is slow but in drier places it grows well on its own roots. It can also be propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. A well drained soil in a sunny position are preferred as the plant is susceptible to frost damage. It does respond well to regular pruning.

The heavy losses experienced in the Gallipoli campaign cemented the need for the service. History =Background= This photographs dated 1906-1923 depicts Hester Maclean during the period when she was Assistant Inspector of Hospitals for New Zealand. Maclean was also Matron in Chief of the New Zealand Army Nursing Service. In 1917 Maclean was awarded the Royal Red Cross (first class) for her work. In 1911 Hester Maclean had been given the title of 'matron-in- chief' of a proposed military nursing reserve, but despite her efforts (and those of Janet Gillies before her) no service existed by the time New Zealand entered the First World War. New Zealand nurses were motivated by the same sense of duty and patriotism as men who volunteered to serve, but despite over 400 women coming forward in the first two months after the outbreak of war, their offers were refused on the basis that enough nurses would be available from England. Hester Maclean pushed for nurses to be sent overseas, writing in the October 1914 issue of the nursing journal Kai Tiaki, ‚ÄúBritain‚Äôs sons are eager to save her. Her daughters too, are all for helping.‚Äù The New Zealand Defence Minister, James Allen was however reluctant, stating that \\"until the Mother Country asks us to provide nurses, it would be a presumption to send them.\\" \\"The Homecoming from Gallipoli\\" by Walter Armiger Bowring. Painted in 1916, it shows the return of the first group of wounded soldiers from Gallipoli in 1915. Note the scarlet capes and grey uniforms of the NZANS nurses, assisting the men. Group portrait of the first 69 nurses and 11 staff to leave for World War I. Taken on the steps of the General Assembly Library, Wellington, by an unidentified photographer for The Press newspaper of Christchurch. Six nurses were sent to German Samoa on 15 August 1914. =Formation and First World War= Eventually Allen bowed to pressure (in particular from Hester Maclean) and on 7 January 1915 sent a telegram to the War office in England offering to dispatch 50 trained nurses, which the British accepted on 25 January. On 25 January 1915, the offer of nurses from New Zealand was finally accepted, and Hester Maclean was asked to select 50 nurses to travel to England. Meanwhile Allen had submitted a proposal to Cabinet recommending that authority be given to provisionally enrol 60 nurses and that the Defence Act be amended to make provision for the New Zealand Army Nursing Service (NZANS). This proposal was approved by cabinet on 11 January 1915. The establishment of the NZAS contributed to a surge of interest in woman interested in becoming nurses. By August 1915 Waikato Hospital was struggling to cope with the number of applicants it was receiving for nurse training and had a waiting list of over 100. At short notice in March 2015, a dozen nurses were requested by the Australian government to join a nursing contingent sailing to Egypt and they departed on 1 April. On 8 April 1915 the 50 nurses lead by Hester Maclean departed on the SS Rotorua , from Glasgow Wharf in Wellington. The nurses were farewelled by a large crowd with the nearby buildings were decorated with bunting, parting gifts were given to them, while a band played popular tunes such as ‚ÄúThe Girl I Left Behind Me‚Äù. In choosing the nurses Maclean had drawn from as many hospitals as possible. All of the women were unmarried, with at least six years of nursing experience and their average age was 27. On arrival in London, the 50 nurses were given orders to sail on to Egypt to tend to the wounded arriving from Gallipoli. Hester Maclean accompanied them and remained in Egypt to meet further nursing contingents from New Zealand. Along with tending the terrible wounds of the soldiers, the nurses had to treat dysentery, typhoid and heat stroke. They were working long hours in high temperatures, and sometimes in tented hospital accommodations pitched on the sand. Lottie Le Gallais, a nurse in a later contingent who served aboard the hospital ship Maheno wrote \\"Terrible, terrible wounds. The bullets aren‚Äôt so bad but the shrapnel from exploding shells is ghastly. It cuts great gashes, ripping muscles and bones to shreds. Thirty-nine men have died on board so far and every one suffered great pain and discomfort.\\" By August 1915 a second contingent of nurses from New Zealand arrived in Egypt, and a third contingent of 11 nurses had departed aboard the hospital ship Maheno. Ten nurses lost their lives when the troopship Marquette was torpedoed and sank in the Aegean Sea on 23 October 1915. Approximately 550 woman served in the NZANS, while other New Zealand woman served with organisations such as the Imperial Nursing Service. Uniform during World War I The first nurses who left New Zealand in August 1914 to serve with the New Zealand Medical Corps in Samoa wore a uniform) based on a design by Hester Maclean, that was similar to those being worn by other overseas organisation. Once the NZANS was officially formed Maclean proposed In October 1914 that the official uniform include a large cloak. This cloak was however replaced in the final proposed design with more practical long coat. The final uniform was approved in February 1915. The outdoor uniform consisted of a long grey woollen dress and a coat with a grey bonnet with ribbon ties. The dress featured a Chinese style collar and had small brass NZ Army buttons on the bodice. An option for outdoor use was a short red cape and the coat which had a scarlet collar. The coat had only a half belt at the back, but many nurses added a full belt for which they were reprimanded. The nurses were permitted to have uniforms made providing they used the same style. While there were variations over the course of the war generally due to different tailoring and use of different materials it remained basically the same. As the need for a lighter uniform became evident when the women were serving in Egypt this led towards the end of the war to the skirt length becoming shorter. The official badge of the NZANS consisted of a red cross enclosed within a silver fern, surmounted by a crown. It was worn on all the outdoor and working uniforms.

After service in the campaign, M-1 was relocated to the North Sea. In February 1940, M-1 sank four Esbjerg fish trawlers, Ejjam (E 92), Gerlis (E 456), Merkator (348), and Polaris (E 504), killing all 16 crew members. Bartels later justified his decision with military necessity, as the neutral fishermen allegedly send coded messages to alert British forces to his presence on the Doggerbank. After the German attack on the Soviet Union, M-1 was part of the naval component of Operation Siegfried, the occupation of the islands Dag√∂, √ñsel, and Moon. Soon afterwards, M-1 became flotilla leader of 55. Vorpostenflottille operating on the west coast of occupied Norway. On 12 January 1945, M-1 was sunk in Nordbyfjord, near Bergen in Norway, by Avro Lancaster aircraft of 9 and 617 Squadrons, Royal Air Force, using Tallboy bombs.

It has hard, rough grey bark on the trunk, smooth grey bark above, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cylindrical or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus litorea is a mallee that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, hard, fissured bark on most or all of the trunk, smooth grey bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have greyish-green, egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides, lance- shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, about long and wide with a conical to beaked operculum long. The flowers are white and the fruit is a woody, cylindrical or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus litoralis was first formally described in 1989 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen Brooker collected near Israelite Bay in 1984. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. This song features \\"alternately rapped and sung exposition\\". History alt=Lin-Manuel Miranda performs an early version of Alexander Hamilton at the White House Poetry Jam This song was originally part of a group of songs entitled \\"The Hamilton Mixtape\\" and created by Lin-Manuel Miranda as he started interpreting and adapting Ron Chernow's Hamilton biography for the stage. He performed this number live at a White House poetry jam in 2009. The National Review noted \\"The Obamas and the other guests react with more than a touch of surprise.\\" The New Yorker writes that \\"Miranda later heard that the President's first reaction was to remark that Timothy Geithner had to see this.\\" Miranda has stated that although this song was originally written as a monologue for Aaron Burr, as the project evolved from a mixtape into a musical, he felt it was important to bring the rest of the characters into the opening number, and references the prologue of Sweeney Todd in doing so: \\"All our characters set the stage for our main man's entrance.\\" The musical, and this song's YouTube video in particular, have influenced education; Miranda said \\"I think teachers used just that one clip for the past six years as their intro to Hamilton.\\" In February 2016, the song was performed live at the Grammys, the first time a song was broadcast live from a Broadway stage for the Hollywood award show. Billboard said they \\"wowed\\", while TV Line deemed it \\"crowd-pleasing\\". Billboard deemed it the night's fourth best live musical moment, writing \\"the emotional, enervating retelling of American history was one of the night's standout moments\\". Rolling Stone also deemed it a highlight and wrote \\"It's not Hamilton's most compelling set piece, but it's a very solid introduction to the show's characters, cast and themes. For millions that won't be able to make it to Broadway this year, watching it performed on network TV was the next best thing to actually scoring a ticket.\\" Synopsis This song is explanatory, setting up who the main character is and summarizing the first two decades of his life in a \\"bracingly economical synopsis of Hamilton's early years\\". It also introduces the other major characters of Aaron Burr, John Laurens, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, George Washington, Hercules Mulligan, Marquis de Lafayette, Angelica Schuyler Church, and Maria Reynolds, and briefly describes Hamilton's relationships to many of them. This \\"prologue\\" to the story, according to Patheos, \\"doesn't just bring Hamilton to life, but all of his contemporaries as well\\". The derogatory terms used in the number to describe Hamilton, including \\"bastard\\", \\"orphan\\", \\"son of a whore and a Scotsman\\" are repeated throughout the musical in a motif that demonstrates how his upbringing would haunt him for the rest of his life, despite his attempt to escape his childhood misfortunes and climb to the top of the social ladder. This term was \\"derived from a contemptuous description by John Adams\\". For over two centuries both Hamilton and Burr have been well- known for their infamous duel, in which Burr fatally shot Hamilton. In the opening number, Burr himself acknowledges this, essentially giving away the ending. Thus, like the musical Titanic, the story becomes more about the journey than the destination. Analysis The Atlantic notes that the musical's opening question \\"How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor grow up to be a hero and a scholar?\\" is answered throughout the following two acts, and essentially becomes \\"relentless labor\\", epitomised in Burr's rise to power, Hamilton's written documents, and Eliza's securing of Hamilton's legacy. Uloop argues that Burr is actually Hamilton's main character, writing that in this opening number \\"Lin portrays his Burr as one completely knowing of his crime to come, in the style of Jesus Christ Superstars Judas, and with the ferocity of Les Mis Javert.\\" Reception ten-dollar bill in part because fans of the Hamilton musical opposed the change. The song has received critical acclaim. The Huffington Post argues that the song's wordplay and self-awareness elevates it above other opening numbers that rely on this \\"sung exposition\\" technique. Pitchfork explains that the song sets the musical tone by incorporating rap while being \\"still essentially in musical-theater territory\\". With Burr acting as the narrator of this number, the Los Angeles Times comments: \\"fitting, somehow, that the man who jealously slew Hamilton in a duel is the first to take up the mystery of his story\\". In an interview with Vulture, rapper Talib Kweli effusively praised the song as an exemplar of hip-hop, saying, \\"My heart swelled with pride after I heard this song, because I was like, 'This right here is hip-hop.' Hip-hop has no boundaries and no limits, and Lin-Manuel and his crew are proving it\\". Ricordia described it as \\"the anthem of a man that changed the world\\", and argued it should be the anthem of all listeners too. Hitfix notes that the song's opening stanzas \\"have this sort of great simple stripped down quality, just demonstrating how dense the rhyme schemes are, and conveying a lot of information, including a reminder that Hamilton is a face we see every day and rarely consider. Vibe wrote that the song has \\"booming instrumental, which features dramatic pauses and guitar strings\\".

The Governorate of Chilo√© depended on the Captaincy General of Chile until the late 18th century when it was made dependent directly on the Viceroyalty of Peru. The administrative change was done simultaneously as the capital of the archipelago was moved from Castro to Ancud in 1768. The last Royal Governor of Chilo√©, Antonio de Quintanilla, depended directly on the central government in Madrid. Extent The Governorate of Chilo√© had its de jure northern limit a Bueno River in continental Chile. There the governorate limited with the territories of Valdivia. The area de facto controlled included the Chilo√© Archipelago, the seashore forts and settlements north of Chacao Channel plus the Mission of Nahuel Huapi which was nevertheless financed from Valdivia. Historian Gabriel Guarda do however disagree claiming the Mission of Nahuel Huapi was within the jurisdiction of Valdivia. The so- called juncos of Osorno (Huilliches) attempted in the late 18th century to have their lands, that lied just south of Bueno River, to be removed from the Governorate of Chilo√© and incorporated to Valdivia. The reason of this was their bad relation and history of warfare with the settlements of around Chacao Channel. Royal governors All 17th century Royal Governors were named by the Royal Governor of Chile. In the 18th century this system changed and while still named by the Royal Governor of Chile the position were to be ratified by the King of Spain. Later in the 18th century the Viceroy of Peru took over the duties of naming governors but still with the need of ratification by the King of Spain. Formally the office was granted based on merits during all of the 17th century. However, in the early 18th century \\"pecuniary service\\" begun also to be considered, which meant in practice that the office could be purchased. This practice was abolished in 1750. The office of Governor of Chilo√© was commonly used to booster a carrier and then access more desirable positions of power in Central Chile. The position of Royal Governor of Chilo√© dates to the early 17th century. Before that a succession of corregidores existed including Alonso Ben√≠tez and Alonso de G√≥ngora Marmolejo. Antonio Mej√≠a who was sent by Alonso de Ribera to rule Chilo√© died in a shipwreck in 1603 while approaching the archipelago. *Andr√©s Herrera (?‚Äì1643)Barros Arana 2000, p. 282. *Fernando de Alvarado (1643‚Äì?) *Ignacio Carrera Iturgoyen (c. 1650)Barros Arana 2000, p. 337. *Antonio Manr√≠quez de Lara (1680s) *Bartolom√© Gallardo *Jos√© Mar√≠n de Velasco (1708‚Äì1712, 1715‚Äì1719)Olgu√≠n, pp. 21‚Äì24 *Blas de Vera Ponce y Le√≥n *Nicol√°s Salvo (1719‚Äì1723)Olgu√≠n, pp. 24‚Äì26 *Juan D√°vila de Herzelles (1724‚Äì1728) *Fracisco Jos√© Sotomayor *Bartolom√© Carrillo *Alonso S√°nchez del Pozo *Francisco Guti√©rrez de Espejo (1740‚Äì1741)Olgu√≠n, pp. 28‚Äì29 *Victoriano Mart√≠nez de Tineo (1743‚Äì1748)Olgu√≠n, pp. 29‚Äì31 *Antonio Narciso de Santa Mar√≠a (1749‚Äì1761)Olgu√≠n, pp. 31‚Äì34 *Juan Antonio Garret√≥n (1761‚Äì1765)Olgu√≠n, pp. 34‚Äì37 *Manuel Fern√°ndez de Castelblanco (1765‚Äì1768)Olgu√≠n, pp. 37‚Äì38 *Carlos de Beranger Dusonet (1768‚Äì?)Olgu√≠n, pp. 38‚Äì39 *Antonio Mart√≠nez y La Espada The \\"notables\\" of Chilo√©, represented by the local cabildo had a conflictive relation with governor Mart√≠nez y La Espada.

Among theories proposing extra dimensions are: * Large extra dimension, mostly motivated by the ADD model, by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, and Gia Dvali in 1998, in an attempt to solve the hierarchy problem. This theory requires that the fields of the Standard Model are confined to a four-dimensional membrane, while gravity propagates in several additional spatial dimensions that are large compared to the Planck scale.For a pedagogical introduction, see * Warped extra dimensions, such as those proposed by the Randall‚ÄìSundrum model (RS), based on warped geometry where the universe is a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and the elementary particles except for the graviton are localized on a (3 + 1)-dimensional brane or branes. * Universal extra dimension, proposed and first studied in 2000, assume, at variance with the ADD and RS approaches, that all fields propagate universally in the extra dimensions. * Multiple time dimensions, i.e. the possibility that there might be more than one dimension of time, has occasionally been discussed in physics and philosophy, although those models have to deal with the problem of causality. * String theory has one notable feature that requires extra dimensions for mathematical consistency. Spacetime is 26-dimensional in bosonic string theory, 10-dimensional in superstring theory, and 11-dimensional in supergravity theory and M-theory.

Family background All Saints, Turvey, Bedfordshire Turvey Abbey in Bedfordshire came into the Higgins family around 1787, when Charles Higgins, who served as Sheriff of London, bought the manor of Turvey from Charles Henry Mordaunt, 5th Earl of Peterborough. John Higgins, nephew to Charles Higgins, inherited it in 1792.Parishes: Turvey, in A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 3, ed. William Page (London, 1912), pp. 109‚Äì117 http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol3/pp109-117 [accessed 13 February 2016]. John Higgins was the son of Thomas Higgins (died 1794), brother to Charles Higgins and youngest of the five sons of John Higgins, and his wife Mary Parrott. William Cowper wrote a monumental inscription for Mary Higgins, who died in 1791; he was a neighbour of the Higgins family in Weston Underwood, Buckinghamshire from about 1786 to 1792. John Higgins drew a pencil portrait of Cowper, and also painted landscapes. He was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1801. Life The eldest son of John Higgins of Turvey Abbey, and Theresa, eldest daughter of Benjamin Longuet of Louth and Bath, Charles Longuet Higgins was born in his father's house on 30 November 1806. He received his early education at home, and matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge on 14 November 1825. At Cambridge he came under the influence of Charles Simeon. He graduated B.A. in 1830, and M.A. in 1834. All Saints, Turvey, view from the nave Higgins did not go into the Church, which was against his father's wishes. He was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 16 November 1830, but was not called to the bar. From 1836 to 1838 he studied medicine in London, at St Bartholomew's Hospital, or St Thomas' Hospital. Having qualified in medicine, Higgins carried on a general medical practice in Turvey. On the death of his father in 1846 he succeeded to the family property. He went on a five-month tour, with his brother Henry, in Egypt, Syria and Palestine, in 1848. Higgins restored the parish church, where George Gilbert Scott designed the new chancel (1852‚Äì4). He built schools, a village museum, and cottages; and delivered lectures on natural history and other subjects. Higgins was a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant of Bedfordshire. In 1860 he was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire. He died without issue on 23 January 1885. John William Burgon, his brother-in-law, included a biography of Higgins in his Twelve Good Men (1888). With 11 clerics, Burgon highlighted him as \\"the good layman\\". thumbHiggins mausoleum at All Saints, Turvey Works Higgins planned a hymn-book to be used universally in the Church of England. He read a paper on hymnology before the Church Congress in Nottingham in 1871, which was published. Clement considers that it shows the extent to which Higgins had moved from the evangelical views of his childhood and student days, towards a High Church position. Family On 26 June 1853 Higgins married Helen Eliza Burgon, daughter of Thomas Burgon of the British Museum. The second son of John and Teresa Higgins was Henry Hugh Higgins, the botanist; Turvey Abbey was inherited by Henry Longuet Higgins, his eldest son and so nephew of Charles Longuet Higgins. =Family collections= Theresa Higgins bought numerous ethnographic exhibits at the 1806 sale of the Leverian Collection. Charles Longuet Higgins himself collected, from auctions in the 1850s, and created a village museum. In the 1860s he talked to a local society on the topic of the local, as opposed to the general museum; and he disposed of some of his collection, to Henry Christy, and possibly the British Museum, at this period. Henry Longuet Higgins made a sale of collected items in 1904. Some of the original Leverian lots certainly came finally to the British Museum; Kaeppler comments that exact accession routes remain opaque.

They released these albums with Grrr Records. Background The Crossing formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1984 by front man Tony Krogh. Originally a bluegrass band, after some member changes in 1985 they switched to traditional Celtic. Tony teamed up with Pat Peterson and together wrote most of the music and lyrics. Fiddle player Jennifer Ingerson, flute player Mark Hall, and guitarist Mike Baznik rounded out the ensemble, with each member adding creative input and vocal harmonies. They put out their first album Look Both Ways in 1988. In 1989 they asked cellist Hilde Bialach to join, and the group would remain unchanged for 10 years. Albums with this lineup include 1990 - Rise and Go, which would be paired as a double album with Look Both Ways in 1998. 1993 - Dancing at the Crossroads. 1996 - Dochas (Hope) 1998 - In The Court of a King.A Celtic Christmas Celebration In 1999, Pat Peterson left the band amicably to pursue other interests. Since Pat was the main player of bodhran and bones, the band had to decide whether or not to find a replacement, and opted to have Baznik and Hall learn how to play bodhran. Hall also learned bones. They played their last show with Peterson at Cornerstone Festival 1999. They continued as a five-member band for another three years and released Standing Stones in 2002. In February 2002 Baznik announced he was leaving the band but committed to finishing the album, which was released in July. They played their final show with Baznik at Cornerstone Festival 2002.

History Conceived, written and composed to celebrate the newly recovered health of Nancy Storace, the Vienna-based, Anglo-Italian soprano destined to become the first Susanna of Figaro, and to welcome her back to the stage after a temporary loss of her singing voice owing to a nervous breakdown, the short work is compelling evidence of what may indeed have been an amicable and cooperative relationship between Salieri and Mozart. The brisk, four-minute cantata consists of three parts, each by a different composer.Johnston, R., \\"‚ÄòLost' Mozart and Salieri work performed again in Prague\\", The Prague Post, February 16, 2016.

Ofelia was a role that she was to sing in an opera by Salieri, La grotta di Trofonio, scheduled to premiere in June 1785, during the period she was unable to sing, and so the performance was postponed. Her recovery took three months. The cantata, composed in early Autumn, refers to Ofelia anticipating her performance. It is believed that Da Ponte and the composers wrote the cantata within a week, as Mme. Storace returned to the stage on September 19 in Giovanni Paisiello's opera Il Re Teodoro in Venezia ‚Äì a performance the cantata clearly refers to in stanza 27 ‚Äì and exactly a week later the cantata was announced in the local newspapers Das Wienerbl√§ttchen and Wiener Realzeitung, which advertised copies for sale by Viennese publisher Artaria & Co.Kvapilov√°, K., \\"A discovery of world importance\\", National Museum, February 17, 2016.Fra≈àkov√°, R., Rediscovered Mozart Salieri cantata undermines Amadeus scenario, Radio Prague, February 19, 2016.

This vegetable variety is highly productive, slow to bolt to seed, and extremely winter hardy.  Description  The large purple mustard greens leaves have broad savoyed leaves with a violet purple overlay and purple-green variegation. The leaves grow to 300mm to 350 in length and up to ¬±150mm in width. Purple mustard's leaves are succulent and tender; the stems are sweet with a crisp and crunchy texture. Purple mustard greens bring about a savoury, spicy and nuanced peppery flavour.  Seasons Sowing and Availability  Purple Mustard greens leaves are a cool season crop, they thrive in the winter months through spring. When you plant indoors or outdoors, you can plant small sections every three to four weeks for continuous harvests. When you sow seeds, do sow seeds frequently, during cool spring days and where fall conditions are suitable for these leaves. All purple mustard green varieties prefer cool climates for growing with full sun and rich soil with temperatures below 77¬∞ F (25¬∞ C) Frost is tolerable, but freezing temperatures will kill crops. It will grow under higher temperatures but will not produce large leaves.  Facts  Purple mustard greens leaves Purple Osaka Mustard is a member of the Brassica family, collectively known as cruciferous vegetables, along with turnips, broccoli and cabbage. Purple mustard greens leaves are grown for fresh eating, as a cover crop with pesticide qualities, for feedstock and as dual purpose ornamental greens in edible gardens.  Uses of the Leaves  Purple mustard greens leaves can also be cooked with potatoes, onions, tomatoes and mashed after 1 hour on slow (low heat) cooking and is also commonly used in salad green, pot herb, braising and pickling green in a diversity of cuisines from Asia to Europe to South America. Purple mustard greens leaves also pairs well with poultry, legumes, sausages, pork, grilled fish, garlic, creamy sauces and fresh cheeses, nutty oils, light vinegars, citruses such as grapefruit and lemon, mushrooms, fennel, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocados, cumin, basil, mint, pomegranates and stone fruits such as peaches and cherries.  History  Purple mustard greens leaves originate from Chinese, eventually becoming a naturalized common green in Japan. Taxonomists identify as many as seventeen subgroups of mustard greens that can differ sharply in heat, flavour, and appearance. Differentiation in soil types and temperatures can affect the flavour and heat level of mustard greens.

Nutritional Biochemistry, p. 385. Academic Press, London. . Gynoid fat in females is used to provide nourishment for offspring, and is often referred to as 'reproductive fat'. This is because it contains long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are important in the development of foetuses.Thornhill, Randy (2008). The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality, p. 113. Oxford University Press, USA. . However, it is also regarded as a physically attractive feature and serves additionally as an indication towards a woman's reproductive potential for mates.  Characteristics  = Composition = Gynoid fat is mainly composed of long- chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is proposed that babies which are breast-fed are more likely to have increased cognitive capabilities due to these fatty acids being present in the breast milk, as they have been suggested to aid early brain development in foetuses and newborns. The most notable fatty acids found in human breast milk are Docosahexaenoic acid and Arachidonic acid, which have been shown to play crucial roles in the healthy formation and functions of neurons. = Location = Gynoid fat contributes toward the Female body shape that girls begin to develop at puberty; it is stored in the breasts and the hips, thighs and bottom. This process is modulated by estrogen, the female sex hormone, causing the female form to store higher levels of fat than the male form, which is affected primarily by Testosterone. = Difference from android fat = See Android fat distribution The location of android fat differs in that it assembles around internal fat depots and the trunk (includes thorax and abdomen). Android fat has more of a survival role and is utilised by the body as an energy source when energy supplies are low, in contrast to the reproductive functions of gynoid fat.Lancaster, J. B. (1986). Human adolescence and reproduction: An evolutionary perspective. School-Age Pregnancy and Parenthood. Hawthorne, NY: Aldine de Gruyter, 17-39.  Reproductive function  Gynoid fat is primarily a store of energy to be utilised in the nurturing of offspring, both to provide adequate energy resources during pregnancy and for the infant during the stage in which they are breastfeeding.Plowman, Sharon & Smith, Denise (2007). Exercise Physiology for Health, Fitness, and Performance, p. 218. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. When there are insufficient energy resources in the environment or health issues which require energy to combat a woman's storage of gynoid fat is likely to be reduced. Therefore, ancestrally, a female with high levels of gynoid fat would be signalling to males that they are in an optimal state for reproduction and nurturing of offspring. This can be seen in the fact that a female's Waist‚Äìhip ratio is at its optimal minimum during times of peak fertility - late adolescence and early adulthood, before increasing later in life.Thornhill, Randy (2008). The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality, p. 117. Oxford University Press, USA. As a female's capacity for reproduction comes to an end, the fat distribution within the female body begins a transition from the gynoid type to more of an android type distribution. This is evidenced by the percentages of android fat being far higher in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women. Sex differences =Sexual dimorphism= The differences in gynoid fat between men and women can be seen in the typical \\"hourglass\\" figure of a woman, compared to the inverted triangle which is typical of the male figure. Women commonly have a higher body fat percentage than men and the deposition of fat in particular areas is thought to be controlled by sex hormones and GH.J√ºrim√§e, J., Hills, A. P., & J√ºrim√§e, T. Cytokines, Growth Mediators and Physical Activity in Children during Puberty. Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers, 2010, p. 7. The hormone estrogen inhibits fat placement in the abdominal region of the body, and stimulates fat placement in the gluteofemoral areas (the buttocks and hips). Certain hormonal imbalances can affect the fat distributions of both men and women. Women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome, characterised by low estrogen, display more male type fat distributions such as a higher waist-to-hip ratio. Conversely, men who are treated with estrogen to offset testosterone related diseases such as prostate cancer may find a reduction in their waist-to-hip ratio.Johansen, Magnus D. Exercise and Health Research. Nova Publishers, 2007, p. 3. Sexual dimorphism in distribution of gynoid fat was thought to emerge around puberty but has now been found to exist earlier than this.Goran, M. I. & Sothern, M. S. Handbook of Pediatric Obesity: Etiology, Pathophysiology, and Prevention. CRC Press, 2005, p. 42.  Relevance in sexuality  = Sexual signalling: Waist-to-hip ratio = Gynoid fat bodily distribution is measured as the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), whereby if a woman has a lower waist-to-hip ratio it is seen as more favourable. Studies have found correlations between WHR and Intelligence quotient (IQ) levels. It was found not only that women with a lower WHR (which signals higher levels of gynoid fat) had higher levels of IQ, but also that low WHR in mothers was correlated with higher IQ levels in their children. Android fat distribution is also related to WHR, but is the opposite to gynoid fat. Instead, android fat is deposited in the waist, breasts, buttocks and thighs, but can give an unattractive appearance, as it gives women a ‚ÄòT-shaped‚Äù body and is more lumpy. The ratio of a woman‚Äôs gynoid to android fat is used to measure her WHR, whereby the lower the WHR, the higher gynoid to android fat ratio, which is perceived as more attractive for women. As women with higher levels of gynoid fat distribution are seen as more attractive, this enables them to access highly desirable male mates. WHR is related to various markers of health and fertility, for example a high WHR is correlated with: a low estrogen/testosterone ratio (this means that a woman has more of a 'T-shaped' body which is seen as less healthy and attractive); a high ratio is also correlated to circulatory system problems such as heart attacks and strokes; more disease (e.g. cancer); and is a general sign of increased age and hence lower fertility, therefore supporting the adaptive significance of an attractive WHR. This advantage of being more fertile has been supported by various studies, for example artificial insemination studies involving sperm donors, where the best predictor of success is a low WHR. Similarly, a high WHR has been associated with impairment in the pregnancy rate of IVF (in vitro fertilisation) embryo transfer women due to the higher levels of android fat distribution. Further studies have also found that oestrogen replacement in women lowers the WHR in pre- and post-menopausal women, and that this is because oestrogen replacement maintains gynoid fat distribution in the body. = Sexual signalling: Breasts = Both android and gynoid fat are found in female breast tissue. Females develop breasts around puberty and breasts with less android fat and more gynoid fat are firmer. Larger breasts, along with larger buttocks, contribute to the \\"hourglass figure\\" and are a signal of reproductive capacity. The proportion of gynoid fat is a good predictor of female reproductive capability, such as conception probability and likelihood of successful pregnancy. As humans evolved and became bipedal, other ways of signalling such as sexual swelling became less visible and consequently other forms of sexual signalling had to develop. Being able to store an optimum amount of gynoid fat requires a female to have access to resources such as food and therefore is an honest signal of having sufficient energy resources to successfully reproduce. = Cosmetic surgery = However, not all women have the most optimal distribution of gynoid fat, hence there are now trends of cosmetic surgery, such as liposuction or breast enhancement procedures which give the illusion of attractive gynoid fat, and can create a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) or larger breasts than some are able to achieve naturally. Other examples include micrograft surgery, which involves the deposition of adipose tissue, previously taken from the waist, into the buttocks. This achieves again, the lowered WHR and the 'pear-shaped' or 'hourglass' feminine form; all deemed attractive features. Cosmetic surgery represents a vast body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that people are evolutionarily programmed to be attracted to health features. = Ornamentation = A biological ornament is sexual signal of attractiveness involved in the process of sexual selection, and functions as an honest signal of quality. Sexual ornamentation of females involves more attractive levels of gynoid fat, meaning bigger breasts and buttocks and a low WHR these all signal health, fertility, genetic quality, and thus attractiveness. Ornamentation is important in female intrasexual competition, which involves female-female competition for potential mates and their associated resources. Since the function of such ornamentation is to compete for male resources, females with a lower WHR are favoured. Ornamentation also plays a key role in male mate choice, where again, females with a low WHR are favoured as they are more attractive. The benefits of attractive ornamentation are gaining resources from males. Attractive ornamentation allows more access to highly desirable males with material resources (e.g. food) and higher mating success. Further benefits of attractive ornamentation are seen in the protection of a female and her offspring. This can be from sexually coercive males, or from raiding males who are looking to capture females. = Cultural differences = There has not been sufficient evidence to suggest there are significant differences in the perception of attractiveness across cultures. Females considered the most attractive are all within the normal weight range with a low waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), regardless of fluctuations in BMI, and this finding can be seen as consistent across Indonesian, Chinese, White and African-American young men and women. Psychologists have argued that evolutionary selection processes have facilitated this relationship between WHR and female attractiveness, which has resulted in a consensus that seems to transcend cultural boundaries.  Health issues  Gynoid fat is not associated with as severe health effects as android fat. Gynoid fat is a lower risk factor for cardiovascular disease than android fat. However excess body fat in the main source of estrogen in the body and therefore particularly high levels of gynoid fat can increase the risk of breast cancer developing.

The first prisoner arrived on 8 June 1881. It was reported to be lightly used in its early decades; one report stated that \\"the only ‚Äòlifer‚Äô was a cat called Lady Jane Grey\\". The prison saw a significant industrial dispute regarding sacked warders in 1921, which saw the involvement of future MP Frank Nieass as the secretary of their union. Issues had further arisen regarding the treatment of prisoners at Gladstone by the 1920s. In 1924, a released prisoner told The News that \\"any man who has served six months in Gladstone Gaol has been through hell\\". In 1925, Chief Secretary James Jelley inspected the jail to investigate issues around the \\"harshness of confinement\\". In 1939, it was taken over by the military for use as an internment camp, with all its prisoners transferred to Adelaide. Its use as an internment camp was not long lived; it was used as a military detention barracks for a period, but spent much of the next fifteen years in a state of disuse. The prison was reopened in September 1952, after repairs and renovations, as a result of difficulties regarding the imprisonment of young offenders at Yatala Prison; it was to house mostly males under 25 years away from \\"hardened criminals\\" and teach them skilled trades, while decreasing overcrowding at Yatala. The prison closed permanently in 1975 due to its facilities having become outdated. The prison was opened to visitors in 1978, and now forms a significant local tourist attraction. For a time it was falsely stated that a gallows had been installed during its history and that a number of hangings had taken place; this is untrue, and the only hangings to take place in South Australia were in Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Coorong, Fowlers Bay, Franklin Harbour and Mount Gambier. Casual, guided and ghost tours of the site are available, while accommodation is offered in the former cells; it is also available for functions.

Volvo markets all engines under the Drive‚ÄìE designation, while Geely groups the three- cylinder variants with its other engines under the G-power name. History Development of the new engine family began in 2006, with the decision to only produce four-cylinder engines being finalised in 2007. The intention was to produce smaller, more economical and environmentally friendly engines that would be fitted to every Volvo model. In 2008 Volvo began to upgrade its Sk√∂vde engine plant and invested roughly 2 billion SEK into development and tooling for the VEA. In the autumn of 2013, the first cars with the new engines were delivered to customers, starting with the S60 II and V60 models. At the same time, Volvo began to phase out the five-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, the six-cylinder petrol engines as well as any four-cylinder engines from other manufacturers. Until the end of 2015, nearly all other engines had been phased out, with only a few non VEA engines remaining in production for select models. In December 2014, Volvo introduced the first hybrid variant of a VEA engine with the launch of the XC90 T8. It uses an electric rear axle drive (ERAD) for both electric propulsion and AWD capabilities. Hybrid engines are equipped with a crankshaft integrated starter generator (CISG) that is used to start the engine, capture otherwise lost energy when slowing down and reduce lag at low rpm by acting as an additional supercharger. Volvo refers to this type of hybrid implementation as Twin Engine. In 2015 no three-cylinder engines were released, instead four-cylinder variants with 1.5 L capacity were introduced as base engines on some models. Volvo nearly completed the phaseout in 2016 with only two variants of the five-cylinder diesel remaining in production for the 60-series models. With the introduction of Volvo's new flagship sedan in 2016, the S90, the PowerPulse anti-lag system for the top of the range diesel engines was unveiled. It uses a small tank of compressed air that can instantaneously be released into the turbocharger to help with spool up, thereby reducing turbo lag. Volvo began testing of three-cylinder variants in mid 2014, it had been planned to introduce these engines in 2015. With their smaller capacity and less power they were meant to be used as base engines. In the second half of 2017, the first production VEA three-cylinder engine was released with the debut of the LEVC TX, where it is used as a range extender. The first Volvo three-cylinder VEA was slated for introduction in 2018 for the XC40 under the T3 engine designation, however it saw only limited release. Due to stricter emissions laws, additional and improved emissions control equipment was introduced, beginning in the second half of 2017 for the 2018 model year. Diesel engines gained a SCR-catalyst to decrease NOx emissions, petrol engines received a particle filter. These changes are referred to as VEA GEN2. This improved the emissions rating to Euro 6c and for some engines to Euro 6d-TEMP. The improvements were rolled out in stages and some engines, particularly the hybrid variants, remained in Euro 6 configuration until the second quarter of 2018. By model year 2019 all engines had been updated to achieve Euro 6d-TEMP certification, with some engines getting discontinued. All diesel engines are now equipped with Ad-Blue and all petrol engines with a particle filter. Volvo has been developing a major update for all its engines since 2017. It is code- named VEA GEN3 (with VEP GEN3 and VED GEN3 respectively) and part of Volvo's effort to hybridize all of its engines. The MHEV variants will have a 48V network separate from the high-voltage battery system. New B badging for hybrid vehicles. Deviating from the previously introduced T (1994 with the T-5, without the dash in 1996 for X70) and D (2002 with the D5 engine, expanded in ~2009 with D4 and D3 subdivision) naming/badging scheme. The system uses kinetic energy recovery via a belt driven integrated starter generator (BISG) which is stored in a 48V 0.25 kWh lion battery. Under heavy load or rapid acceleration the BISG is used as an power adder. P0 hybridization. =Nomenclature= The engine codes consist of a series of letters and digits. The actual, broadly used engine code is 7 or 8 characters long. Hybrid models can have a second engine code that is 7 characters long, mild hybrids engine codes are 6 characters long. Different, more general engine codes are used for some certification and approval documents and are 6 to 8 characters long. An additional 2 characters are used to identify each specific engine variant with an MP or HP suffix to differentiate performance. Standard engine codes: * 1st: Fuel type (B/D) B = Bensin (Petrol), D = Diesel * 2nd: Number of cylinders (3/4) * 3rd & 4th: Approximate displacement in deciliters, may be rounded up or down (19 ~= 2.0 L) * 5th: Valves per cylinder (4) * 6th: Induction method (T) T = turbocharged * 7th & 8th: Engine variant (4/5/6/9/11/14/20/23/27/35/44) Petrol =1.5= All three-cylinder 1.5 L (1,477 cc) petrol engines have a bore of and a stroke of with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. All engines are turbocharged and intercooled with direct injection. All four-cylinder 1.5 L (1,498 cc) petrol engines have a bore of and a stroke of with a compression ratio of 10.5:1. All engines are turbocharged and intercooled with direct injection. All engines are equipped with an electric water pump, but no balancer shafts.

History and aims  In December 2015, the Linux Foundation announced the creation of the Hyperledger Project. The founding members of the project were announced in February 2016 and ten further members and the makeup of the governing board were announced March 29. On May 19, Brian Behlendorf was appointed executive director of the project. The objective of the project is to advance cross-industry collaboration by developing blockchains and distributed ledgers, with a particular focus on improving the performance and reliability of these systems (as compared to comparable cryptocurrency designs) so that they are capable of supporting global business transactions by major technological, financial and supply chain companies. The project will integrate independent open protocols and standards by means of a framework for use-specific modules, including blockchains with their own consensus and storage routines, as well as services for identity, access control and smart contracts. Early on there was some confusion that Hyperledger would develop its own bitcoin-type cryptocurrency, but Behlendorf has unreservedly stated that the Hyperledger Project itself will never build its own cryptocurrency. In early 2016, the project began accepting proposals for incubation of codebases and other technologies as core elements. One of the first proposals was for a codebase combining previous work by Digital Asset, Blockstream's libconsensus and IBM's OpenBlockchain. This was later named Fabric. In May, Intel's distributed ledger, named Sawtooth, was incubated. In January 2018, Hyperledger released the production-ready Sawtooth 1.0. In January of 2019, the first long-term-support version of Hyperledger Fabric (v1.4) was announced. Members and governance Early members of the initiative included blockchain ISVs, (Blockchain, ConsenSys, Digital Asset, R3, Onchain), well- known technology platform companies (Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, NEC, NTT DATA, Red Hat, VMware), financial services firms (ABN AMRO, ANZ Bank, BNY Mellon, CLS Group, CME Group, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Deutsche B√∂rse Group, J.P. Morgan, State Street, SWIFT, Wells Fargo, Sberbank), business software companies like SAP, academic institutions (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Blockchain at Columbia, UCLA Blockchain Lab), systems integrators and others (Accenture, Calastone, Wipro, Credits, Guardtime, IntellectEU, Nxt Foundation, Symbiont, Smart Block Laboratory). The governing board of the Hyperledger Project consists of twenty members chaired by Robert Palatnick, (managing director and chief technology architect for DTCC), and a twelve-member Technical Steering Committee chaired by Dan Middleton, Principal Engineer at Intel.  Notable frameworks  = Hyperledger Fabric = Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, originally contributed by IBM and Digital Asset, providing a modular architecture with a delineation of roles between the nodes in the infrastructure, execution of Smart Contracts (called \\"chaincode\\" in Fabric) and configurable consensus and membership services. A Fabric Network comprises \\"Peer nodes\\", which execute chaincode, access ledger data, endorse transactions and interface with applications. \\"Orderer nodes\\" which ensure the consistency of the blockchain and deliver the endorsed transactions to the peers of the network, and Membership Service Providers (MSPs), generally implemented as a Certificate Authority, managing X.509 certificates which are used to authenticate member identity and roles. Fabric is primarily aimed at integration projects, in which a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is required, offering no user facing services other than an SDK for Node.js, Java and Go. Fabric supports chaincode in Go and JavaScript (via Hyperledger Composer, or natively since v1.1) out-of-the-box, and other languages such as Java by installing appropriate modules. It is therefore potentially more flexible than competitors that only support a closed Smart Contract language. = Hyperledger Iroha = Hyperledger Iroha is being used in Cambodia to create a new payment system alongside the National Bank of Cambodia, and in various other projects across healthcare, finance and identity management. = Hyperledger Sawtooth = Originally contributed by Intel, Sawtooth includes a dynamic consensus feature enabling hot swapping consensus algorithms in a running network. Among the consensus options is a novel consensus protocol known as \\"Proof of Elapsed Time,\\" a lottery-design consensus protocol that optionally builds on trusted execution environments provided by Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX). Sawtooth supports Ethereum smart contracts via \\"seth\\" (a Sawtooth transaction processor integrating the Hyperledger Burrow EVM). In addition to Solidity support, Sawtooth includes SDKs for Python, Go, Javascript, Rust, Java, and C++. = Hyperledger Besu = Besu is an enterprise-grade Ethereum codebase.  Tools  = Hyperledger Caliper = Hyperledger Caliper is a blockchain benchmark tool and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Caliper allows users to measure the performance of a specific blockchain implementation with a set of predefined use cases. Hyperledger Caliper will produce reports containing a number of performance indicators, such as TPS (Transactions Per Second), transaction latency, resource utilisation etc. The intent is for Caliper results to be used by other Hyperledger projects as they build out their frameworks, and as a reference in supporting the choice of a blockchain implementation suitable for a user's specific needs. Hyperledger Caliper was initially contributed by developers from Huawei, Hyperchain, Oracle, Bitwise, Soramitsu, IBM and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. = Hyperledger Cello = Hyperledger Cello is a blockchain module toolkit and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Cello aims to bring the on-demand \\"as-a-service\\" deployment model to the blockchain ecosystem to reduce the effort required for creating, managing and terminating blockchains. It provides a multi-tenant chain service efficiently and automatically on top of various infrastructures, e.g., baremetal, virtual machine, and more container platforms. Hyperledger Cello was initially contributed by IBM, with sponsors from Soramitsu, Huawei and Intel. Baohua Yang and Haitao Yue from IBM Research are committed part-time to developing and maintaining the project. = Hyperledger Composer = Hyperledger Composer is a set of collaboration tools for building blockchain business networks that make it simple and fast for business owners and developers to create smart contracts and blockchain applications to solve business problems. Built with JavaScript, leveraging modern tools including node.js, npm, CLI and popular editors, Composer offers business-centric abstractions as well as sample apps with easy to test DevOps processes to create robust blockchain solutions that drive alignment across business requirements with technical development. Blockchain package management tooling contributed by IBM. Composer is a user- facing rapid prototyping tooling, running on top of Hyperledger Fabric, which allows the easy management of Assets (data stored on the blockchain), Participants (identity management, or member services) and Transactions (Chaincode, a.k.a. Smart Contracts, which operate on Assets on the behalf of a Participant). The resulting application can be exported as a package (a BNA file) which may be executed on a Hyperledger Fabric instance, with the support of a Node.js application (based on the Loopback application framework) and provide a REST interface to external applications. Composer provides a GUI user interface \\"Playground\\" for the creation of applications, and therefore represents an excellent starting point for Proof of Concept work. = Hyperledger Explorer = Hyperledger Explorer is a blockchain module and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Designed to create a user-friendly Web application, Hyperledger Explorer can view, invoke, deploy or query blocks, transactions and associated data, network information (name, status, list of nodes), chain codes and transaction families, as well as any other relevant information stored in the ledger. Hyperledger Explorer was initially contributed by IBM, Intel and DTCC. = Hyperledger Quilt = Hyperledger Quilt is a business blockchain tool and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by The Linux Foundation. Hyperledger Quilt offers interoperability between ledger systems by implementing the Interledger protocol (also known as ILP), which is primarily a payments protocol and is designed to transfer value across distributed ledgers and non-distributed ledgers. The Interledger protocol provides atomic swaps between ledgers (even non-blockchain or distributed ledgers) and a single account namespace for accounts within each ledger. With the addition of Quilt to Hyperledger, The Linux Foundation now hosts both the Java (Quilt) and JavaScript (Interledger.js) Interledger implementations. Hyperledger Quilt was initially contributed by NTT Data and Ripple. = Hyperledger Ursa = Ursa is a modular, flexible shared cryptography library.

History The term 'steering cognition' was coined by the researcher Simon P. Walker who discovered consistent, replicable patterns of attention and corresponding response through repeated cognitive tests between 2000 and 2015, in studies with over 15,000 individuals. Working with his colleague Jo Walker, he was able to show that these patterns correlated with other cognitive attributes such as mental wellbeing, social competency and academic performance. Together, Walker and Walker conjecture that steering cognition is a central mechanism by which people self-regulate their cognitive, emotional and social states. Theoretical model Steering cognition describes how the brain biases attention toward specific stimuli whilst ignoring others, before coordinating responsive actions which cohere with our past patterns of self-representation. Steering cognition enables the use of limited cognitive resources to make sense of the world that someone expects to see. Empirical evidence Walker developed a specific steering cognition test used with more than 11,000 candidates between the ages of eight and 60 between 2002 and 2015. Using principle component analysis, Walker was able to identify 7 latent largely independent 'heuristic substitution' factors which he labelled S, L, X, P, M, O, T. He labelled this data model 'the Human Ecology model of Cognitive Affective Social state' or CAS for short. In the most recent and largest ever study, involving 8,000 secondary pupils in the UK, exploratory factor analysis confirmed a largely orthogonal factor analysis structure in which Eigen values revealed the CAS model 7 latent factors explained 50% of the overall variance. For the sake of parsimony, a 7 factor solution has been regarded as acceptable. Studies have shown that steering cognition is distinct from the mind's engine or 'algorithmic processing' which is responsible for how we process complex calculations. The state of steering cognition at any time is influenced by 'priming' effects - cues in the surrounding environment such as sights, sounds and messages of which we may not be conscious. Studies have shown that environmental biasing of our steering cognition can contribute to non-conscious in-group behaviours, e.g. an increased likelihood of groupthink or emotional contagion. Studies have shown that, during adolescence, individuals develop more fixed patterns of steering. By adulthood, these patterns become recognisable as mental traits, behaviours and social attributes. There are some authors, including Meredith Belbin, who claim that people with more flexible steering cognition have advantages in jobs which require greater social or cognitive dexterity because of improved social relating and leadership skills. Steering cognition has been shown to depend on our ability to mental simulate or imagine ourselves performing tasks and functions. As such, Steering cognition requires the capacity to self-represent, associating memories of our past and possible future selves. Steering cognition has been shown to implicate our affective (emotional), social and abstract cognitions. Effects on learning, social and emotional development  The ability to regulate steering cognition has been shown to account for up to 15% of academic outcomes at secondary school not accounted for by IQ. Steering cognition can be improved through pupil feedback, coaching and more carefully structured and supportive environments. Poorly regulated steering cognition has been shown to correlate strongly with increased mental health and welfare risks during adolescence. A study in 2015 showed that pupils with certain fixed biases in their steering cognition were four times more likely to exhibit self-harm, be bullied or not cope with school pressures. A large 2014 study showed that boarding school education resulted in better pupil ability to regulate steering cognition across social situations than day school education. This so-called 'tribe effect' is conjectured to lead to continued social advantages beyond school, such as access to future in-group benefits in work and wider society. Practical applications The importance of steering cognition lies in its explanation of human behaviours which lead to either risks or advantages for individuals and groups. The ability to regulate one's steering cognition is unrelated to IQ or rational group behaviour, so measuring steering cognition offers an explanation of behaviours and events not currently detected by traditional metrics and models. The Sunday Times reported in October 2015 that a growing number of schools in the UK, including independent schools Monkton Combe School and Wellington College, are now using a technology, AS Tracking, developed by Mind.World to measure student steering cognition as an 'early warning system' for welfare and mental health risks. Thomas's London Day Schools are using a curriculum, Footprints, to train pupils as young as eight to improve their steering cognition as part of their social and emotional development. Wellington College has engaged in steering cognition research studies as part of the school's evidenced-based education programme. Harrow School, one of Britain's leading independent schools, is piloting AS Tracking as part of a proactive strategy to provide the best possible pastoral care for pupils. The school is measuring steering cognition to gather concrete measurements that can be used as supporting evidence when planning or dealing with individuals and also tracking changes over time as boys move up through the school. Educational campaigners Sir Anthony Seldon and Sir Peter Lampl have suggested steering cognition has application for understanding and improving social mobility. Research fields related to steering cognition Executive function Steering cognition is a model of social and cognitive executive function. It is explains a functional governor mechanism by which the mind coordinates attention and executes responsive action. Metacognition Steering cognition is a model of metacognition. It describes the capacity of the mind to exert conscious control over its reasoning and processing strategies in relation to external data and internal state. Self-regulation Steering cognition is an explanatory mechanism of some phenomena of affective, cognitive and social self-regulation. It describes effortful control processes which exhibit depletion after strain. Mental simulation circuitry Steering cognition has been repeatedly shown to implicate the mind's mental simulation circuitry. As such, it is associated with functional neural circuits involved in prospective and retrospective memory, self-representation, associative processing and imagination. Dual process theory According to the steering cognition model, dual process System 1 functions as a serial cognitive steering processor for System 2, rather than the traditionally understood parallel system. In order to process epistemically varied environmental data, a steering cognition orientation system is required to align varied, incoming environmental data with existing neural algorithmic processes. The brain's associative simulation capacity, centered around the imagination, plays an integrator role to perform this function. Cognitive biases In the cognitive steering model, a conscious state emerges from effortful associative simulation, required to align novel data accurately with remote memory, via later algorithmic processes. By contrast, fast unconscious automaticity is constituted by unregulated simulatory biases, which induce errors in subsequent algorithmic processes. The phrase 'rubbish in, rubbish out' is used to explain errorful steering cognition processing: errors will always occur if the accuracy of initial retrieval and location of data is poorly self- regulated. Social priming Steering cognition provides an explanation of how the mind is non-consciously influenced by the environmental cues, or primes, around it. Steering cognition studies have produced data of attentional bias and blindness best explained by environmental priming.

The aim of these groups is to promote cultural and educational discussions, generally based on presentations by members following a dinner or social gathering. Topics of presentations might include history, culture, government, politics, and science, with controversial subjects welcomed. Unlike many membership organizations, Torch Club does not have community service as a goal. The objective of the international club is to give to the members of different professions the opportunity to meet together in a spirit of fellowship to prevent the narrowing tendencies of specialties by developing a breadth of thought.  History  The International Association of Torch Clubs, Inc., or IATC, was founded in 1924 by William Bullock in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Bullock had the vision of forming an association of clubs across the country with a purpose of broadening intellectual and social horizons. \\"The objective,\\" he said, \\"is to be cultural and educational, to get light and understanding on all vital subjects.\\" He pulled together a group of 75 professionals in Minneapolis to discuss the creation of a new professional association. On July 10, 1924, this group formed the first Torch Club. Bullock then set out across the Midwest to promote this new association. Between 1924 and 1933, with the assistance of D.B. Zimmer, they established a total of fifty-one clubs, many of which remain active to this day. Today, nearly seventy Torch clubs across the United States and Canada meet regularly to hear and discuss cross-profession presentations. Regional directors across the nation work with clubs within their districts to promote membership development, provide assistance from the International office, and set regional meetings where there can be exchanges of ideas and programs between local clubs within the region. An annual Torch convention brings members from many clubs together for meetings, paper presentations, tours and the annual awards night when the Paxton Prize winning paper is delivered. Every Torch club welcomes people with intellectual curiosity, who enjoy discussion, and are willing to hear new ideas with an open mind. Torch presentations are typically 30‚Äì40 minutes in length. They are carefully researched and can be written as papers, which then are submitted for publication in the quarterly magazine, The Torch. The Torch is mailed in print form to all Torch members, and can be read on-line (thetorchmagazine.org).  Paxton award  The Paxton Award is given yearly to the author of an outstanding paper presented by a Torch member at a Torch meeting. The award was created in honor and memory of W. Norris Paxton, past president of the International Association of Torch Clubs and editor emeritus of the Torch magazine. The winning author receives a trophy, an honorarium, and paid registration to the IATC convention. The winner is introduced at the convention banquet where he or she (or a designated representative) delivers the paper.

The film is a representative work of cinema marginal, the Brazilian underground filmmaking movement of the 1960s. Sganzerla was 21 years old when he directed it. Sganzerla called the film a Third World western. Plot Jorge, a S√£o Paulo house burglar, nicknamed by the press the \\"Red Light Bandit\\", baffles the police by using peculiar techniques. Always carrying a red flashlight, he rapes his victims, has long dialogues with them and makes daring escapes. Afterwards, he spends the profits of his crimes. The bandit's exploits are shown in a fragmented manner, voiced over by two narrators in the style of a sensationalistic radio program.

It has rough, fibrous, fissured bark on the trunk, smooth greyish bark above, flower buds in groups of seven or more, white flowers and shortened spherical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus longicornis is a tree that typically that grows to a height of and can reach as high as . It has rough, grey brown, fibrous, often fissured bark on the trunk, smooth white to greyish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are glaucous, more or less square in cross-section, and sessile, lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, thick, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and thirteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a pointed operculum long. Flowering occurs between December and February and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding well above the rim of the fruit. The capsules contain over 200 seeds per gram and persist on the tree until at least the following year, often longer. Taxonomy and naming Sketch of E. longicornis from A critical revision of the genus Eucalyptus This species was first formally described in 1878 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus oleosa var. longicornis and published the description in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. In 1919 Joseph Maiden noted that Mueller had referred to the species as Eucalyptus longicornis, including in his book Eucalyptographia without having published a description of that species. Maiden published the new name in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, acknowledging Mueller's first use of it. The Noongar peoples know the tree as morryl, poot or put. The specific epithet (longicornis) is derived from the Latin words longus meaning \\"long\\" and cornu meaning \\"horn\\", referring to the shape of the flower buds. Distribution The red morrel is distributed through the Wheatbelt and southern Goldfields- Esperance regions of Western Australia. It is found growing in loamy soils, often over limestone or clay loam on flats. The dark red loams, that are rich in minerals and often slightly saline, associated with the decomposition of the fine-grained dolerite gneiss dykes and outcropping units of the Yilgarn Block best suit the tree. Ecology The species is usually found in woodland communities where it is an overstorey tree, in an unmixed stand or with E. salmonophloia and either E. melanoxylon, E. wandoo, E. loxophleba, E. astringens or E. kondininensis. Associated species in the understorey include Sclerolaena diacantha, Lycium australe, Melaleuca merrallii, Melaleuca pauperiflora and Rhagodia drummondii. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses Eucalyptus longicornis is a tall tree with potential to be cultivated on highly alkaline, saline and clayey soils. It is marketed as an ornamental or windbreak species and is useful for apiculture. The wood was used historically in the mining industry as a source of timber and fuel. The fine-textured, reddish to dark red-brown wood has considerable potential for use in high value furniture and craftwood.

The Beachy Head Lady lived during the Roman period, around 200 to 250 AD, and is thought to have originated from Sub- Saharan Africa. Beachy Head Lady is thought to be the first known person of sub-Saharan origin in Britain. As part of the Eastbourne Ancestors project, 300 sets of human remains excavated from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries were re- examined. Heritage Officer Jo Seaman and his team found two boxes labelled \\"Beachy Head, something to do with 1956 or 1959\\". Inside they found a very well-preserved human skeleton. Initial inspection by an osteoarchaeologist reported that the remains belonged to a young female who was about five feet tall. Caroline Wilkinson was asked to perform a forensic facial reconstruction, and upon seeing the skull, immediately recognised her features as those of a sub-Saharan African. Radiocarbon dating established that the Beachy Head Lady lived around 200 to 250 AD. Although there are other examples of Africans at this date in Britain, such as the Ivory Bangle Lady found in York, it is nonetheless a highly unusual discovery as Sub-Saharan Africa was not part of the Roman Empire. Isotope analysis indicated that the Beachy Head Lady grew up in southeast England. Jo Seaman said the results were intriguing: \\"Whether that means that she's first generation we don't know. She could possibly have been born in Africa and brought over here at a very young age, but it's just as likely that she was born here.\\" The Beachy Head Lady was exhibited to the public for the first time at the Eastbourne Museum.

Biography He was born on March 15th, 1861 in Vr≈°ac. He was the brother of the famous Serbian painter Paja Jovanoviƒá and Milan Jovanoviƒá, the most famous Serbian photographer of the 19th century. He finished high school in Vienna, where he began his studies in painting. He continued his studies in 1879 in Petrograd, Munich (with his brother Paja Jovanoviƒá) and Paris at the Zillian Academy. He spent most of his life in Paris, where he lived for fifty years. He was especially esteemed in Paris, where he lived and was gladly accepted into the highest circles of France. One of his closest friends was the son of the President of the French Republic, Sadik Karno. Svetislav Jovanoviƒá was decorated in 1928 with the French Order of the Legion of Honor, and the Kingdom of Serbia awarded him the highest rank: the Order of the White Eagle and the Order of Saint Sava. Svetislav Jovanoviƒá made a self-portrait of himself in a fencing suit with a brush in his hands. Namely, he was not only an artist but also a swimmer, rider and swordsman with worldwide fame at the time. In Paris, Svetislav won the highest championship titles in 1904 and 1907 as a swordsman. About this, Gaston Renar, Jovanoviƒá's biographer, who places him among the world's most celebrated swordsmen, writes: \\"Hundreds of the defeated dropped their weapons under Jovanoviƒá's blows.\\" swordsmen of the world such as Boda, Lana, Busea. That all this was not an exaggeration can be seen from the fact that Jovanoviƒá was the president of the largest and most powerful fencing club in France - the \\"Paris Fencing Club\\", which brought together personalities from the highest circles of France. Jovanoviƒá was elected to the post as a foreign citizen, although the rules explicitly stipulated that the president could only be French. Jovanoviƒá died in Paris in 1933 and was buried in the Perlausez Cemetery, where the site is only for the most respected.http://www.macevanje.org/macevanje_svetislav_jovanovic.htm Svetislav Jovanoviƒá Biography Works *Prelje (-1899) *Polazak u lov (1899) *A≈°ikovanje (1901) *Albanac (1905) *Orijentalka (1905‚Äì10) *Mlada crnogorka (1910) *Autoportret (1921) Prelje, Svetislav Jovanoviƒá.jpgPrelje (B&W; copy) File:Polazak u lov, Svetislav Jovanoviƒá.jpgPolazak u lov (B&W; copy) See also * List of Orientalist artists * Orientalism * Serbian art * List of painters from Serbia References Sources * External links * Category:20th-century Serbian people Category:Serbian painters Category:People from the Kingdom of Serbia Category:People of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Category:1861 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Realist painters Category:Orientalist painters Category:20th-century painters ","title":"Svetislav Jovanoviƒá"},{"id":"49459396","text":"Relief was a stern-wheel driven steamboat that operated on the Willamette River from 1858 to 1865. Relief ran for a short time on the route from Portland to Oregon City, Oregon. After being bought out by the competition, Relief was lined around Willamette Falls to the upper Willamette, where it became the first steamboat to reach Springfield. This vessel should not be confused with a later vessel, also named Relief, which operated on the Columbia and Lewis rivers from 1906 to 1931. Construction Relief was built in 1858 for the firm of Cassidy (or Cassedy) & Co. The steamer was reported to have been well-built. Relief was built at Linn City, Oregon, across the Willamette River from Oregon City, where another steamer, the Carrie Ladd was being built at the same time. Construction was under way by early April, 1858. The original owners were also referred to as O‚ÄôLoughlin and Company and as Cassedy, Athey, O‚ÄôLaughlin, Sturtevant & Co. Design Relief was designed to navigate the Clackamas Rapids, on the Willamette River not far below Oregon City, at any season of the year. Dimensions Relief was either or long, measured over the hull, and excluding the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the ‚Äúfantail‚Äù on which the stern-wheel was mounted. Relief had a beam of , exclusive of the guards, which were heavy timbers installed along the sides of the vessel at the top edge of the hull as protective measure. The depth of hold was . The overall size of the vessel was 97 gross tons, which was a unit of volume rather than weight. Engineering Relief was driven by a stern-wheel, turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of , generating 9.6 nominal horsepower. The machinery was manufactured by Rossi & Sons at their Willamette Iron Works. Operations Relief made its trial trip on Monday, August 16, 1858. The steamer was scheduled to make a run to Vancouver, W.T. on August 21, 1858. =Opposition to the Jennie Clark= Cassedy and Company placed Relief into service in August 1858, running in opposition to the steamer Jennie Clark, which was owned by John C. Ainsworth and Jacob Kamm. In November 1858, Cassedy advertised rates on the Relief, running between Portland and Oregon City, as $2.50 per ton for freight and 50 cents for passengers. Cassedy held out the following appeal: Cassedy also reminded that the steamers Jennie Clark, Express and Carrie Ladd all belonged to a single company. Cassedy held only a minority interest in the company. The other principal shareholders, of whom one O‚ÄôLoughlin, a ferryman, was one, did not agree with Cassedy on how the boat should be operated. O‚ÄôLoughlin was suspicious of his partners, and kept a close watch on the purser, one Sturdevant (or Sturtevant), who was also a shareholder. =Control purchased by competitor= The competition between Relief and Jennie Clark grew so hot that Captain Ainsworth secretly bought up the majority of shares of the Relief, then had the boat tied up. Transfer to upper Willamette River The next year, Ainsworth sold Relief to Captain John Wilson Cochran (1823-1913), who had the steamer lined around Willamette Falls, to be placed on the Upper Willamette River. On Tuesday, October 4, 1859, with Captain Cochran in command, Relief returned to Oregon City from Corvallis, with 85 tons of freight, the largest load ever carried by the steamer up to that time. Freight rates at that time on the upper Willamette River were $12 per ton for freight going upriver, and $7 per ton for freight going downriver from Corvallis, $6 per ton for downriver cargo from Salem. As of November 1, 1859, Relief had been formed into a single concern, called the Upper Willamette Transportation Line, which also included the steamers Onward, Elk, and Surprise. All four vessels had a common agent, Capt. Theo. Wygant. In November 1859, when the water level in the river permitted, one of the lines boats would depart Canemah twice a week for Corvallis, and, once a week, for Eugene City. This arrangement continued until July 1860. Escape from fire On the night of April 23/24, 1861, Relief was nearly destroyed by fire at the dock at Linn City. Relief and another steamer, James Clinton, having arrived in the afternoon, were moored in the boat basin upriver from the works of the Oregon Milling and Transportation Company, The fire originated in the company‚Äôs warehouse and quickly spread. There was later talk that the cause might have been arson. People tried to save the two vessels, both built entirely of wood, and they were successful in the case of the Relief, which even so was still damaged. The Clinton however caught fire, burned to the water‚Äôs edge, and sank. Loss to the owners of the Clinton, Capt. James D. Miller, John T. Apperson, and others, was about $6,000. Damage to the Relief was estimated to be about $500. Continued service on the upper Willamette On Saturday, December 29, 1861, Relief arrived at Eugene City, with Captain Cochrane in charge. The last day, Sunday December 30, Relief made what was described as the ‚Äúpioneer trip‚Äù to Springfield, with many of the townsfolk of Eugene on board. The return from Springfield to Eugene, a distance of five miles, was completed in 26 minutes. Relief loaded about 13 tons of freight at Springfield and 17 tons from Eugene City. On March 28, 1862, Relief, still running under John W. Cochran, arrived at Eugene City with 8 tons of freight, and was scheduled to depart the next day with 40 tons of cargo from the local merchants. On Saturday, February 28, 1863, Relief arrived at Eugene for the second time that winter, having taken three days on the trip from Oregon City. With the water in the river falling fast, Relief loaded some freight and returned downstream the same day. Relief eventually came under the control of the People's Transportation Company, which, by the mid-1860s had a near- monopoly on transport on the Willamette River. Disposition Relief was dismantled at Canemah, Oregon in 1865.

He primarily plays as a hooker. Delahunt currently plays for Irish provincial side Connacht in the Pro14. A product of the province's academy, Delahunt signed his first full contract with the side in December 2015, becoming a member of the senior squad in the 2016‚Äì17 season. Early life Delahunt was born and raised in Birr, County Offaly. A graduate of Kilkenny College, Delahunt captained the college team in the Leinster Senior Cup in 2012. Delahunt also played GAA in his youth, playing primarily at full forward for club and county up to under-14 level. Rugby career =Early career= Playing prop in his teenage years, Delahunt was part of the Leinster under-age set up, captaining the province's under-19 side. At under-20 level, Delahunt was advised to change position to hooker due to competition in the prop positions and his own lack of size. During this adjustment Delahunt's progression stalled and he was primarily used as a replacement on the province's under-20 team. During his time in the Leinster youth set up, he was registered with University College Dublin team. Having been in the Leinster sub-academy for two years however, Delahunt did not progress to the academy. After this setback back Delahunt, still aiming to become a professional player, began playing for the Lansdowne under-20s, before contacting Nigel Carolan, academy coach at rival province Connacht and seeking a trial. =Connacht= Delahunt joined Connacht on an initial three-month trial in the summer of 2014. He trained with the team and played in a preseason friendly against Clermont Auvergne. Despite only being a trial player, Delahunt featured for the senior team early in the 2014‚Äì15 season. With both Se√°n Henry and Jason Harris-Wright injured, Delahunt was an unused replacement for a 2014‚Äì15 Pro12 game against Leinster and the following week, on 24 September, he made his debut from the bench against Glasgow Warriors. In October 2014, Delahunt signed an academy contract with the side and later that week made his first start in a league game against Benetton Treviso. With the move to Connacht he also joined Buccaneers, an All-Ireland League side in the province. Delahunt made his European debut later that year, featuring as a replacement against Bayonne in the 2014‚Äì15 Challenge Cup on 13 December 2014. Including this European appearance, Delahunt made a total of nine appearance for the senior team over the course of the season. In his second year in the academy, Delahunt again featured for the senior team. He started for Connacht on 28 November 2015 in their win over Munster, the province's first victory in Thomond Park since 1986. It was announced in December 2016 that Delahunt had signed a senior contract with the province which sees him become a full member of the first team squad in the 2016‚Äì17 season. =International= Delahunt has represented Ireland at under-age level. While playing prop as part of the Leinster under-age set up, he played for the Irish under-18 schools team and the Irish under-19s. Delahunt was part of the Ireland squad for the 2014 Six Nations Under 20s Championship . He made his only appearance for the team as a substitute in the game against Scotland on 31 January.

Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green on both sides, broadly lance-shaped, long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven, sometimes on an unbranched peduncle in leaf axils, or on a branching peduncle on the ends of the branchlets. The Peduncle is long with the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between May and September and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped to cylindrical or conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus lucasii was first formally described by the botanist William Blakely in 1934 in his book, A Key to the Eucalypts. The type specimen was collected by Charles Fitzgerald Fraser \\"per\\" W.C. Grasby from around Lake Barlee in 1919. The specific epithet honours Arthur Henry Shakespeare Lucas. Eucalyptus lucasii belongs in Eucalyptus subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Adnataria (also known as the boxes). Within the Adnataria section, E. lucasii is part of a subgroup, series Buxeales which are all found in south-eastern Australia, with only four occurring in Western Australia, those being E. cuprea, E. absite, E. normantonensis and E. lucasii. All four have inflexed stamens which separates them from the eastern species. Distribution and habitat Barlee box grows in sandy soils in shrubland in a broad area of central Western Australia. It occurs in the northern goldfields from Leonora and the western part of the Great Victoria Desert and north to the Pilbara. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

At the age of 28, he took a three-year solitary voyage through Russia, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Shortly after his return to the Netherlands, he moved to Cannes. The report of his travels totals over 2,200 pages in four volumes. Tinco amassed an exceptional collection of oriental paintings and artifacts, which he donated to the city of Cannes in 1877. This collection is the centerpiece of the modern , the municipal museum of Cannes. Tinco Lycklama remained a citizen of Cannes until his death in 1900 and was a key personality in the fin-de-si√®cle of the C√¥te d'Azur.  Family background  Tinco Lycklama, undated drawing (source: Annales de la Soci√©t√© scientifique et Litt√©raire de Cannes). Tinco Lycklama was the oldest of the seven children of Jan Anne Lycklama √† Nijeholt (1809-1891), esquire, mayor of Opsterland and a member of the States Provincial of Frisia, and his wife Ypkjen Hillegonda van Eysinga (1815-1854). Tinco was named after his grandfather who was a grietman (mayor-judge) of Ooststellingwerf (1788-1790) and Utingeradeel (1790-1795). Tinco's mother died when he was only 16. In his travel diaries, he wrote that she gave him a taste for foreign languages and cultures.Tinco Martinus Lycklama √† Nijeholt,Voyage en Russie, au Caucase et en Perse, dans la M√©sopotamie, le Kurdistan, la Syrie, la Palestine et la Turquie, ex√©cut√© pendant les ann√©es 1866, 1867 et 1868, Tome I, \\"Artus Bertrand\\", Paris, 1872. Four brothers and sisters died young. His sister Eritia Ena Romelia Lycklama √† Nijeholt (1845-1902) and his brother Augustinus Lycklama √† Nijeholt (1842-1906) survived him. Born and bred in the reformed religion, he converted to Catholicism through the influence of his encounters in Palestine. On 21 July 1875, in Oosterhout, he married the catholic Baroness Juliana Agatha Jacoba thoe Schwartzenberg en Hohenlansberg (Oosterhout, 11 June 1845 - Leeuwarden, 11 June 1914), a daughter of Gemme Onuphrius Tjalling Burmania, Baron thoe Schwartzenberg en Hohenlansberg (1806-1862) and of Hendrika de Hoogh (1803-1880). In Cannes, Tinco Lycklama, although only an esquire, went by the nickname of \\"Baron Lycklama\\". Tinco and his wife remained childless.  Early years at Beetsterzwaag  Tinco grew up in a wealthy aristocratic family that owed its fortune to large land holdings, interests in the turf industry, smart marriages, and its position in Frisia's traditional elite. He spent his early years in the house where he was born at Beetsterzwaag (the \\"Lycklamahuis\\", situated on today's Hoofdstraat 80). His sister Eritia inherited this property in 1891, after the death of their father Jan Anne. When their mother died, in 1854, their property \\"Eysingahuis\\"Het Eysingahuis te Beetsterzwaag (on the Hoofdstraat 46) ‚Äì was co-owned by both the father and his children. Later, in 1868, Tinco became its sole proprietor. From September 1856, Tinco studies law at the university of Groningen. After 1861, he moves to Paris where he enrolls at the Ecole des Langues Orientales.  Discovering the Middle East  Travel itinerary of Tinco Lycklama in 1865-1868 (source: \\"Voyage...\\", collection BNF/Gallica In Paris, Tinco Lycklama conceived plans for a voyage of discovery and exploration through the Middle East. His main interests are Persia and Syria. In his opinion, most of his contemporaries seemed more interested in Asia and the Americas, whereas he had a passion for Mesopotamia and the Levant. His ambition was not to re-write the region's history, but rather to observe and to share the contemporary situation of this little-known part of the world, and to do so from a variety of angles (including tourism). But he would do more than that. Along the way, he bought all sorts of artifacts and conducted various archaeological digs. He took home a significant collection of objects that established his reputation as one of the first Dutch orientalists. His finds and observations in Persia in particular contributed significantly to our modern knowledge of the Qajar dynasty, which ruled Persia from 1789 to 1925. Tinco left Paris in April 1865. He travelled via Berlin and Russia to Tehran through the Caucasus. It was an unusual itinerary, as most travelers in those days preferred to take a more direct route via the Mediterranean and Turkey. Tinco's choice stems from his reading of the stories of French merchant-traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (1605-1689). In April 1866, he arrived in Teheran where he spent six months. Next, he crisscrossed the region and visited Baghdad and other cities in modern Iraq. In September 1867, he left for Syria, where he spent eight months traveling the whole country. Then he took two months to discover Palestine and Jerusalem, before returning to Syria. In September 1868, he left the Middle East and travelled back to the Netherlands via Constantinople, Varna, Pest, and Vienna. He finally arrived home, at Beetsterzwaag, on 5 October 1868.  A remarkable collection, a captivating travel story  Eysingahuis, Hoofdstraat 46 at Beetsterzwaag (The Netherlands). Tinco's home between 1868-1872 housed the first 'Lycklama Museum'. Tinco Lycklama moves into the Eysingahuis of which he had become the sole proprietor in 1868. He transforms the house to accommodate not only himself and his staff but also the collection of objects he brought back from his travels. In fact, a substantial part of the house becomes a genuine museum. As many objects had stayed behind in the Middle East but had started to arrive in Beetsterzwaag, the museum was expanding by the week. In 1870, he recruited a private secretary, the Frenchman Ernest Massenot, whose mission consisted of building a descriptive inventory of the collection. By the end of 1871, they published a first (incomplete) catalogue.Ernest Massenot, Mus√©e de M. le Chevalier T.M. Lycklama √† Nijeholt - Notice descriptive provisoire, Deuxi√®me, P.J. Leemans et Vanberendonck, Bruxelles, 1871. This highly eclectic collection comprised oriental jewelry and paintings as well as clothing and archaeological finds. At the time, the significance of the collection was not immediately understood, but this changed with the growing international attention for this collection. One of the major factors that contributed to Tinco's reputation was the publication of his travel diaries. He started editing these diaries in Cannes, where he went to recover from illness related to his travels. Whereas Cannes had only been a big village of 4,000 inhabitants in 1840, it had grown into one of the favorite winter destinations of the elites of northern Europe, particularly under the influence of Lord Brougham, an English aristocrat and Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. Tinco not only loved the mild climate in Cannes: he also found an international community that was keen on his colourful travel stories. For a while, Tinco kept traveling between Beetsterzwaag and Cannes, while managing his collection and preparing the publication of his diaries. The end result is an opus of over 2,200 pages (in four volumes), rich in observations on culture, politics, arts, tourism, and people. Between 1872 and 1875, a new volume was published every year through his editors in Paris and Amsterdam. During that time, Tinco decided to leave Beetsterzwaag for good. Owing to his inheritance and investments, he can live a life in luxury. He moved permanently to Cannes.  \\"Baron Lycklama\\"  His move to Cannes occurred shortly before the publication of the first volume of his travel stories, towards the end of 1872. This also spelled the end of the first Lycklama Museum in Beetsterzwaag, as the collection moved with him. Tinco took up quarters in the luxurious Villa Escarras, situated on today's boulevard Carnot near the rue Lord Byron. At that time, Cannes was still a charming little town but expanding with a growing number of pretty villas, mostly west of the Mont-Chevalier. It was still early days for the famous Croisette. The construction of a railroad connecting Paris to the Mediterranean coast, and the opening of a station in Cannes in 1863, profoundly changed the landscape of the town. Tinco's villa had a large park, surrounded by open land and sparse luxurious villas. Soon, the villa is renamed \\"Villa Lycklama\\". In 1875, at Oosterhout (Netherlands), Tinco married Juliana Agatha Jacoba thoe Schwartzenberg en Hohenlansberg, who moved with him to Cannes. Rapidly they became welcome guests and hosts for the upper classes, who included rich bourgeois and aristocrats from Paris, England, Russia, Prussia... Tinco's \\"bals masqu√©s\\" were major events. One of them was portrayed by Tinco's friend, the artist Pierre Tetar van Elven, and Tinco enjoyed portraits of himself in oriental garb. The commercial developments around the future boulevard Carnot encouraged the Lycklama to sell their property and move into a new \\"Villa Lycklama\\" in today's rue Lycklama. They also acquired other properties nearby, giving them names such as Burmania and Eritia - popular first names in the Lycklama family.  Lycklama collection becomes the municipal museum of Cannes  Mus√©e de la Castre, Cannes In 1872, Tinco Lycklama joined the Soci√©t√© des Sciences naturelles, des Lettres et Beaux-Arts. Established in 1868, the society continues today as the \\"Soci√©t√© Scientifique et Litt√©raire de Cannes\\"). This erudite society has counted many illustrious personalities such as the writer Guy de Maupassant, the Nobel Prize winner Fr√©d√©ric Mistral, and Pedro II, the emperor of Brazil. Appreciated for his knowledge, his experience and his collection, Tinco Lycklama became one of its major benefactors. Towards the end of 1877, Tinco Lycklama donated his collection to the city of Cannes. A few months later, the Soci√©t√© des Sciences naturelles contributed its library. Together, these two donations are housed in the new town hall (where there is a \\"Salle Lycklama\\" to this day). These collections became the cornerstone of the modern Mus√©e de la Castre, the municipal museum of Cannes located on the Mont-Chevalier (better known as the \\"Suquet\\", appreciated for its winding streets with restaurants and bars). The Lycklama collection remains a central component of the museum and is important for our knowledge about the Qajar dynasty. It still honours Tinco Lycklama as a pioneer in this field of expertise. Part of the collection is placed as a permanent loan to the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden (The Netherlands).  Death of Tinco  Tinco Martinus Lycklama √† Nijeholt and Baroness thoe Schwartzenberg belong among those who shaped Cannes in the latter part of the 19th century. However, they maintained strong connections to the Netherlands, where they kept very substantial possessions. In various places in both France and the Netherlands they are remembered for their generosity, in particular for their substantial donations to catholic charities. Tinco maintained close personal ties with the St. Francis parish at Wolvega (Frisia), where he built a chapel which became his (and his wife's) last resting place. The Lycklama chapel at Wolvega (Frisia) Tinco Lycklama died in Cannes on 7 December 1900. The town invited all dignitaries and the consular corps to an official ceremony on 11 December. The procession left the Villa Lycklama for the \\"Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Voyage\\" church, where mayor Jean Hibert pronounced an elegy for his close friend. The coffin was then transported to the railway station, whence it left the same evening for its final destination - Wolvega. Cannes lost a remarkable citizen who left his mark on the city. His widow kept her residence in Cannes until 1911. She passed away at Leeuwarden (Netherlands) in 1914 and was inhumed at the chapel at Wolvega.

He was drafted into the Russian Imperial army, from which he succeeded in deserting and reached France. Her mother Yokheved (Vera) Shenker (1900‚Äì1980), was born in Odessa. She was the daughter of a fruit merchant. She studied medicine in Geneva and University of Paris, where she met Yampolsky. When Berta was three years old, the Yampolsky family emigrated to Mandate Palestine. They resided in Haifa. Berta studied at a religious school for girls there, and at Hugim School as well as the Reali School. She began to study dance with Valentina Arkhipova Grossman at the age of fourteen. Yampolsky met Hillel Markman, her future husband, in 1956. He was also a dance student. They married in 1957. The couple moved to England right after the marriage to continue dance studies. Hillel took lessons from Marie Rambert and Berta entered the Royal Academy of Dance. She also studied at Sadler's Wells. Both Hillel and Berta danced with many companies worldwide, including Belgium, Switzerland, France. They also performed with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in USA. The couple returned to Israel in 1964. Upon return to Tel Aviv they were appointed as the main dancers and managers of the Israeli Opera's ballet company. After a year the couple decided to leave the opera, since their dream of starting a high- profile ballet company would not be possible if limited by their operatic performances. Israel Ballet They couple's first independent company was an ensemble called The Classical Ballet of Holon, which they founded in 1967. Most of the performances of this company were based on duos from classical ballets. In 1970 Berta and Hillel established a ballet school in Tel Aviv. Their dance company grew up to include seven dancers. Yampolsky couldn't find high-profile local dancers in Israel and she and Hillel approached immigrants from the United States. Their first known soloists were Pamela Osserman and Marcia Zussman. Until 1975, the company was modest local ballet without high visibility. In 1975 they were invited to perform at the Israel Festival. George Balanchine granted the company the rights to perform Serenade and Pas de deux from Agon free of charge. They also performed Electrobach by F√©lix Blaska at the festival. Practically unknown at that time, Israel Ballet surprised the audience and received a lot of enthusiastic reviews from the critics. Yampolsky toured in the US with her Israel Ballet Company in 1975 and 1981. At that time it included twenty-five dancers. She was awarded prize for best foreign choreographer for her Dvorak Variations in Santiago, Chile. Yampolsky was main choreographer for the following Israel Ballet's performances: The House of Bernarda Alba (1978), Carmen (1980), Untitled (1981), Dvorak Variations (1981), Mendelssohn Concerto (1982), Opus 1 (1983), The Nutcracker (1985) and many more.

It has small, pale greyish to brown bark, glistening, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven on a branching peduncle, creamy white flowers and conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus lucens is a mallee that typically grows to a height of but sometimes as high as , and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pale grey to brownish bark, but often with some rough, fibrous or flaky bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flowers are mostly arranged on the ends of the branches in groups of seven on a thin, branching peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. This eucalypt is a comparatively rare species but is conspicuous due to its glistening leaves, contrasting with those of the few other eucalypts growing in similar areas. Txonomy and naming Eucalyptus lucens was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Clyde Dunlop from a specimen collected by Dunlop on Mount Sonder in 1973. The description was published in the journal Australian Forest Research. The specific epithet (lucens) is a Latin word meaning \\"shining\\", \\"glistening\\" or \\"polished\\", referring to the shining leaves. Distribution and habitat Shiny-leaved mallee grows in open shrubland on shallow soils on sandstone and quartzite hills, mainly on the ranges west of Alice Springs in the northern Territory, but also in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Conservation status This mallee is classified as \\"Priority One\\" in Western Australia, by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

He was based largely in Scotland. He did much analytical work on the findings from the Challenger expedition. He was the first to confirm the Principle of Constant Proportions, a theory first conjectured in 1865 by Johan Georg Forchhammer regarding the major ions of sea-water: that whilst salinity varied across the oceans, the ratios of ionic abundance remained constant. As a result, the Principle is often called \\"Dittmar's Principle\\" or \\"Forchhammer's Principle\\". His research also included calculations of the atomic weight of platinum.http://www.marbef.org/wiki/Salinity_sensors Life He was born in Umstadt near Darmstadt in western Germany on 14/15 April 1833, the son of Fritz Dittmar an Assessor at Umstadt. In 1848 he was apprenticed as a pharmacist at the Hof Apotheker in Darmstadt.Nature (magazine): obituary 24 March 1892 In 1857 went to work in the illustrious Bunsen laboratory in Heidelberg, and his focussed changed to chemical analysis. Here he met Henry Enfield Roscoe who brought him back to Britain with him to work as his assistant at Owen's College in Manchester, Roscoe then being Professor of Chemistry there.

As of September 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 643 endangered fish species. 4.2% of all evaluated fish species are listed as endangered. The IUCN also lists ten fish subspecies as endangered. Of the subpopulations of fishes evaluated by the IUCN, 24 species subpopulations have been assessed as endangered. For a species to be considered endangered by the IUCN it must meet certain quantitative criteria which are designed to classify taxa facing \\"a very high risk of exintction\\". An even higher risk is faced by critically endangered species, which meet the quantitative criteria for endangered species. Critically endangered fishes are listed separately. There are 1098 fish species which are endangered or critically endangered. Additionally 3191 fish species (21% of those evaluated) are listed as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient information for a full assessment of conservation status. As these species typically have small distributions and/or populations, they are intrinsically likely to be threatened, according to the IUCN. While the category of data deficient indicates that no assessment of extinction risk has been made for the taxa, the IUCN notes that it may be appropriate to give them \\"the same degree of attention as threatened taxa, at least until their status can be assessed.\\" This is a complete list of endangered fish species and subspecies evaluated by the IUCN.

Burr tries to flirt with Angelica, but Angelica rejects him and instead professes how she wants a \\"revelation\\" instead of a \\"revolution.\\" Style The New Yorker described the sisters as a \\"Destiny's Child-esque R&B; girl group.\\" Pitchfork said the song wouldn't sound out of place in an album by Wyclef prot√©g√© City High.

During its short operational life, Active was owned by several different steamboat companies. It was dismantled in 1872 at Canemah, Oregon. Construction Active was built at Canemah, Oregon for the Willamette Steam Navigation Company. Dimensions Active was long, measured over the hull, and exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the \\"fantail\\", on which the stern-wheel was mounted. Active had a beam of exclusive of the protective timbers along the upper sides of the hull called the guards. The depth of hold was . The overall size of the steamer was 269.74 gross tons, which was a measure of volume, not weight. The official merchant vessel registry number was 1232. Engineering Active was driven by a stern-wheel, turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and stroke of , generating 13 nominal horsepower. Operations Upon completion, Active was commanded by John T. Apperson, who was also a stockholder in the steamer's first owner, the Willamette Steam Navigation Company. =Competition with the People's Transportation Company= The W.S.N. company had been formed to give competition to the dominant steamer company on the river, the People's Transportation Company. The P.T. Company, as it was known, had bested a number of rivals, but the challenge of the W.S.N. Co., in October 1865, was one of the most serious it had faced. The W.S.N. built Active at Canemah as well as the steamer Alert at Oswego, to make the run from Portland to Oregon City. The new company gained control of the upper Willamette steamer Echo, running both Active and Echo on the upper Willamette against the P.T. Company. Fares dropped fast, so that a passenger could go from Portland to Oregon City for free, then on to Salem fifty cents, with meals and berth free, and then on to Albany for one dollar and to Corvallis for $1.50. Freight rates dropped to fifty cents per ton for shipments from Portland to Oregon City. The steamboats of the rival companies tested their speed against each other on a daily basis. On one occasion, Active and the Reliance, a P.T. Company boat, raced all the way from Canemah to Salem. The speed contests between Reliance and Active were remembered many years later by one old steamboat man as the \\"most exciting boat racing I have ever seen.\\" =Merger of the rival lines= By March 1866, the competition had grown too much for both companies, and they decided to merge. In 1866, when Willamette Steam Navigation Company sold all of its assets, including the steamer Active to the People's Transportation Company, Capt. George Jerome took over, followed a few years later by Capt. George A. Pease. =Sale to Holladay interests= On September 6, 1871, the People's Transportation Company, apprehensive that the pending completion of the locks at Oregon City would bring a new challenge to its near-ten-year monopoly, voted to dissolve the corporation and sell all its assets, including the steamer Active, to Ben Holladay's company, the Oregon and California Railroad, for $200,000.

It is about an attractive young woman living with an avant-garde artist who falls disastrously for the voyeuristic owner of the gallery which shows her husband's work. Clouzot's only film completed in colour, it was the last of his career. Clouzot and his wife Vera Plot Stanislas, a wealthy unmarried owner of an art gallery in Paris, is friend and patron to Gilbert, a creator of progressive artworks, who lives in a little suburban flat with Jos√©, a television editor. At the opening night of an exhibition, Gilbert goes off with an attractive young woman who is an influential critic. Left alone, Jos√© goes back with Stanislas to his luxurious flat, where he shows her a photograph he had taken of a naked woman in bondage. Though she is shocked and leaves, the allure of Stanislas and of his pornographic image works in her mind until one day she asks him if she can sit in on a photo session. Finding herself increasingly excited by the rising erotic tension of the shoot and by the sexiness of the pretty young model, Jos√© angers Stanislas by leaving in confusion. The two make it up, however, and Jos√© starts posing for him, but she wants more than this artificial connection. Gilbert, unhappy with her unexplained absences, goes on a business trip to Germany, and Jos√© and Stanislas travel together to an inn in Brittany. After a night together, Stanislas has second thoughts and abandons her there. Deeply hurt at this behaviour, Jos√© tells all to Gilbert on his return. He rushes off to Stanislas' flat, intending to kill him, but the two reach a sort of reconciliation. Following in her own car, Jos√© shoots a level crossing and is hit by a train. Coming out of her coma in hospital, she thinks that Gilbert, waiting by the bedside, is Stanislas come to reclaim her. Cast *Laurent Terzieff : Stanislas, art gallery owner *Bernard Fresson : Gilbert, avant- garde artist *√âlisabeth Wiener : Jos√©, Gilbert's partner *Dany Carrel : Maguy, Stanislas' model *Michel Piccoli : guest at the gallery *Charles Vanel : guest at the gallery *Joanna Shimkus : guest at the gallery Themes The film is close in theme to some other pictures of the time. Both Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up and Michael Powell's Peeping Tom explored the dark links between men who make erotic images of women, films about such men and their models, and the viewers of such films, while Luis Bu√±uel's Belle de jour acted out the sadomasochistic fantasies of a beautiful middle-class woman. Contemporary also are its visual elements of pop and psychedelic art, including a striking dream sequence reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (similar use of these elements can be found in Clouzot's aborted earlier film L'Enfer).

At present, the plant manufactures equipment for the construction, oil production, roa construction, metallurgy and mining industries. The plant has divisions in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and in various cities of Russian Federation. History =The Soviet Union= The plant is located 18 kilometers from the city of Kuybyshev (former name of Samara), near the district of Bezymyanka. It was created under Construction Directive No.77 of Narkomat, dated March 23, 1940 Construction started only in January 1941, and the plant's first block was built by May 15, 1941 using the small shops left over from the former construction site. In October 1942, the first technical equipment was assembled and the plant was commissioned, and November 2, 1942 is considered the \\"birthday\\" of the Kuybyshev Strommashina Plant, after a newly erected workshop began production of items for military use. From its establishment up until 1945, the plant‚Äôs main specialization was to fulfill urgent governmental orders for the manufacture of metal structures and the installation of towers and radio masts. In 1945, the plant was given a work plan to produce items that were of the utmost importance for the recovery of the USSR economy: rotating steam cylinders, water-jacket furnaces, dampers, drying cylinders and traveling trolleys. The plant also continued the production of items for the Ministry of Defense. In 1946, the enterprise was renamed the Kuybyshev Strommashina Plant. In 1959, the plant switched from manufacturing relatively simple machines to producing highly complex equipment for the country's construction and chemical industries. By the early 1960s, the plant was starting to produce larger and more complex equipment ‚Äì mills, concrete-pouring and concrete-placing machines, and bag filters. More than 50 types of new equipment was produced. This included more than 10 models of mills and concrete-placing machines, four models of drying cylinders, etc. The plant‚Äôs output changed qualitatively. In 1968-70, the plant switched to production of the 6001-6008 series ball and rod mills. Thanks to the use of elastic couplings instead of gear couplings, and the application of self- aligning spherical bearings in roller mills, the durability of these assemblies increased 1.5 to 2 times. To reduce the noise the mills produced, steel linings were replaced with rubber linings. The lining procedure for the mill body became much less laborious. The plant was awarded the Honor Sign and, since 1982, has been officially called the Kuybyshev Honor Sign Plant Strommashina of the Volga Cement Machine-Building Production Association (\\"Volgotsemmash\\") of the Ministry of Construction, Road and Municipal Machine- Building. =Russian Federation= Since 1991, the plant has been called the Samara Strommashina Plant. Since 2005, the plant has fulfilled annual military item orders from Gosoboronzakaz. The 2008-2009 global crisis has repeatedly influenced the stock of orders and, thus, the plant‚Äôs industrial development. Nevertheless, output has been increased from year to year by expanding into new markets (metallurgy, mineral concentration, etc.). Based on recent market trends, efforts are now being made to increase the diameters and linear dimensions of the rotating equipment and mills being manufactured. In recent years, the plant has started to produce tangential hammer mills and roller mills. Roller mills are widely used in various industries, namely: construction, chemicals, mining, metallurgy, coal mining, mineral concentration, etc. Roller mills are efficient in grinding materials with maximum hardness of 9.3 and humidity of no more than 6%. The produced fraction range is 0.045 ‚Äì 1.6 mm and is customer specified. The trapezoidal roller mill with a separator is used for grinding of >1,000 various materials, such as: cement (clinker), limestone, gypsum, talc, slags, graphite, feldspar, coal, dolomite, mica, granite, quartz, marble, etc. In recent years, equipment has been delivered to the following geographic areas: all regions of Russia, the Baltic states, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Germany, Poland, and Iran. In 2010, OOO Strommashina took first place in the Power Engineering Cooperation Contest (in the category of Transport, Small and Medium Businesses) carried out by KES-Holding and OAO Volga TGK in 16 regions. Output At various times, the plant has mass- produced dozens of types of crushing, grinding, drying and other equipment:  External links  * English version * official website * grinding and crushing equipment * drying and firing equipment  References  Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1942 Category:Companies based in Samara, Russia Category:Manufacturing companies of the Soviet Union Category:Manufacturing companies of Russia Category:1942 establishments in the Soviet Union ","title":"Strommashina"},{"id":"49460025","text":"Vasileios Hatzis or Vassileios Chatzis (, 1870 ‚Äì 1915) was a Greek painter who was best known for his seascapes.

Work Hatzis is primarily known for his seascapes, but also painted landscapes and genre scenes from the life of farmers and fishermen. His work includes both academic and en plein air styles. The influence of impressionism may be detected in his work. He first exhibited in Athens in 1899, and his works were shown in group exhibitions in Athens (1902, 1907, 1909, 1910) and Alexandria (1903, 1906). A solo exhibition was held soon after his death at the Zappeion hall in Athens that showed more than 260 works.

It stars Rooney Mara, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Ruby Stokes, Tara Fitzgerald, Natasha Little, and Tobias Menzies. The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on September 2, 2016. It was released in the United Kingdom on September 1, 2017, by Thunderbird Releasing and in the United States on October 6, 2017, by Swen. Plot A young woman, Una, arrives unexpectedly at an older man's workplace looking for the truth behind the three-month sexual relationship that occurred when she was a 13-year-old child and he was a next- door neighbor and trusted friend of her father. The facts came to light on the eve of their planned elopement abroad. Convinced by a misunderstanding that Ray had abandoned her in the coastal hotel room where he had just taken her virginity, she wandered the streets distraught and bewildered, to be returned home by police. He served four years in jail for his crime, treated as the lowest form of humanity by fellow inmates. Having changed his name from \\"Ray\\" to \\"Peter Trevelyan\\", he has risen to management level in a large warehouse. She grew up lonely and confused, living with her mother in the same house they lived in before the incident, and in her adulthood, now takes solace in going out for one-night stands and returning home before dawn. Una finds where he works through a newspaper photograph and confronts him. She is still emotionally wounded from what happened. Instead of empathizing with her, Ray at first fears she may want to damage his career or even kill him. Ray leaves the room to attend a critical staff meeting, where he must announce cutbacks and layoffs to employees. He is unable to function at the work meeting, leaves abruptly, and hides from angry executives and his fellow staff members. Una finds him. They quarrel: he insists that he was genuinely in love with her, is not by nature a hebephile, and had not been \\"grooming\\" her. He tells Una he is now married to a woman his own age. It's obvious that Ray and Una are still attracted to one another. To Una's surprise, he explains that his \\"abandonment\\" of her was a misunderstanding: he had needed a walk and a drink to clear his head, but returned to find that she had vanished. She instigates sex with him, but before it goes too far, Ray abruptly leaves and returns to his home, leaving her feeling abandoned once again. Una leaves the warehouse with Scott (Ahmed), a young single man, and Ray's co-worker. She invites herself to Scott's flat, where she seduces him. She then persuades Scott, by claiming to be \\"Pete's\\" daughter, to escort her to Ray's comfortable suburban home. Ray and his wife are hosting a large party, and he is shocked to see Scott and Una arrive. The wife and Una talk briefly, and she drops a hint that their marriage is not entirely happy (earlier, we saw Ray have sex with his wife with his eyes closed on getting home). Una wanders upstairs, where she curls up on the bed of a teenage girl - the daughter of Ray's wife, from an earlier marriage, also aged about 13 - who is obviously loved and cared for. The girl enters and loudly demands an explanation. Ray denies Una's unspoken accusation. He insists Una is the only one of that age he has ever desired, that she still is \\"the only one\\" as he kisses her face, all while his wife, step-daughter and Scott look on from a distance. Una walks off into the dark.

The book was authored by K. V. Sarma who was a Reader in Sanskrit at Vishveshvaranand Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies, Panjab University, Hoshiarpur, at the time of publication of the book (1972). The book, among other things, contains details of the lives and works of about 80 astronomers and mathematicians belonging to the Kerala School. It has also identified 752 works belonging to the Kerala school. Even though C. M. Whish, an officer of East India Company, had presented a paper on the achievements of the mathematicians of Kerala School as early as 1842, western scholars had hardly taken note of these contributions. Much later in the 1940s, C. T. Rajagopal and his associates made some efforts to study and popularize the discoveries of Whish. Their work was lying scattered in several journals and as parts of books. Even after these efforts by C. T. Rajagopal and others, the view that Bhaskara II was the last significant mathematician pre-modern India had produced had prevailed among scholars, and surprisingly, even among Indian scholars. It was in this context K. V. Sarma published his book as an attempt to present in a succinct form the results of the investigations of C. T. Rajagopal and others and also the findings of his own investigations into the history of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. Outline of the contents The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 gives an outline of the salient features of Kerala astronomy. Sarma emphasizes the spirit of inquiry, stress on observation and experimentation, concern for accuracy, and continuity of tradition as the important features of Kerala astronomy. Adherence to the Aryabhatan system, use of the katapayadi system for expressing numbers, the use of the Parahita and Drik systems for astronomical computations are some other important aspects of Kerala astronomy. Chapter 2 gives a brief account of the mathematical discoveries of Kerala mathematicians which anticipate many modern day discoveries in mathematics and astronomy. Among other topics, Sarma specifically mentions the following: Tycho Brahe's reduction to the ecliptic, Newton-Gauss interpolation formula, Taylor series for sine and cosine functions, power series for sine and cosine functions, Lhuier's formula for the circum-radius of a cyclic quadrilateral, Gregory's series for the inverse tangent, and approximations to the value of pi. Chapter 3 contains a discussion on the major trends in the Kerala literature on Jyotisha. This gives an indication of the range and depth of the topics discussed in the Kerala literature on Jyotisha. Chapter 4 is devoted to providing brief accounts of the Kerala authors of mathematical and astronomical works. There are accounts of as many as 80 authors beginning with the legendary Vararuchi I who is believed to have flourished in the 4th century CE and ending with Rama Varma Koittampuran (1853‚Äì1910). Chapter 5 is a bibliography of Kerala Jyotisha literature. This chapter contains essential information about as many as 752 works produced by Kerala astronomers and mathematicians. Chapter 6, the last one of the book, discusses works produced in regions outside Kerala, based on Kerala jyotisha.

Playing career  Lancaster played second row and back row for Mumbles, Swansea University RFC, Swansea RFC and London Welsh RFC, before retiring from competitive rugby at the age of 24 due to a serious knee injury.  Coaching career  Following Lancaster's premature retirement from playing he moved into coaching first with Mumbles RFC and then taking the Head Coach role for Swansea University. Lancaster presided over the team for 7 years, in his first year winning promotion and taking the team into the British Universities and Colleges Premiership. He had a successful tenure as coach maintaining their Premiership status and securing a proud 5 wins v 3 defeats in the Annual Welsh Varsity. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! Year ! Location !

At his time as Director of Rugby, Johnson was quoted as saying that these were two of the most promising young coaches in Welsh Rugby and flagged their names as potential future Ospreys coaches. Lancaster moved from the Ravens to Swansea, firstly in the position of Performance Manager in the 2013-14 season and then following Swansea relegation out of the top flight of Welsh Rugby Lancaster was appointed Director of Rugby for the start of the 2014-15 season. He is joined on the coaching team by Team Manager Paul Whapham, Backs coach Rhodri Jones, Forwards coach Christian Loader and Skills Coach Ben Lewis. In 2014 the All Whites were relegated from the Welsh Premier league on the final day of the season when despite beating Neath at St Helens, a bonus point for Aberavon sent Swansea into the SWALEC Championship. This provoked a complete revamp of the club with Stephen Hughes taking the position of Chairman, Keith Colclough as Managing Director and Richard Lancaster leading a coaching team of former players including Rhodri Jones, Chris Loader and Ben Lewis. In their first season Swansea missed out on promotion back to the Premiership, finishing in second place overall, but were consequently promoted in the 15/16 season along with Merthyr, RGC 1404 and Bargoed. Swansea struggled to adapt to the Premiership in their first two seasons back at the top flight although despite a crippling injury list, the 17/18 season showed much promise with the side recording five wins, a draw and 10 losing bonus points for losing the game within 7 points. The 2018/19 season is a hugely important season for the club with potentially five clubs being relegated from the Welsh Premiership in order for the league to contain 12 teams in the 19/20 season. The coaching team of Richard Lancaster, Hugh Gustafson, Ben Lewis, Nick Roberts and Liam Carpener-Jones are currently preparing a squad consisting of many of the 17/18 squad along with new additions which are being announced on the club website regularly. =Professional life= Lancaster currently works for Swansea University as Head of Sport and Corporate Engagement.https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard- lancaster-732b1839?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile Lancaster helped develop the concept of the Welsh Varsity.

She was pressured by national and provincial volleyball bureaus to reconsider her decision. Refusing to return to beach volleyball, she was banned from competition and faced a possible early retirement from her athletic career. Due to massive backlash from provincial media, and because of the Jiangsu team's historically low performance in the 2013-2014 season, the ban was lifted on December 29, 2013 and she has since been playing for Jiangsu in the CVL.

At the Origins of Mathematical Economics: The Economics of A.N. Isnard (1748-1803). Routledge, 19 dec. 2005.  Biography  Achille-Nicolas Isnard was born in Paris. He first studied some mathematics, map drawing and fortification,Van Den Berg (2005, 9) before attending the √âcole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, nowadays the √âcole des ponts ParisTech, from 1767 to 1773. In 1775 he started his career as assistant engineer in Arbois, near the Swiss border.Van Den Berg (2005, 11) Later he was employed as engineer at the Ponts et Chauss√©es (public works) of Paris.Robert Fox (2012), Technological Change: Methods and Themes in the History of Technology, p.44 In 1781, at the age of 33, Isnard anonymously published his Trait√© des richesses, in two volumes with the London publisher Fran√ßois Grasset. Later in 1801 he published his ', under his own name in Paris. The former is directed against the theory of the produit net and of the single tax of Quesnay; Isnard does not mention Adam Smith, although generally concurring with the latter's views on the origin of wealth, the effects of protection, and of the accumulation of gold and silver, etc.Castelot, E. (1896) 'Achille Nicolas Isnard', Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy. London, vol.2:460. As an engineer Isnard frequently had recourse to mathematical symbols, although he did not venture farther than equations of the first degree and simple problems in the rule of three. As having done this, he is mentioned by Stanley Jevons in his Theory of Political Economy.Stanley Jevons, Theory of Political Economy. 2nd ed. 1879, appendix i. p. 301.  Work  BEIC, biblioteca digitale.) = Criticizing the physiocratic theory = Isnard criticized the physiocratic theory, because of its claim that the agricultural sector was the only productive sector in the economy. He argued that Fran√ßois Quesnay in his 1758 Tableau √©conomique had already shown that both the agricultural and the manufacturing sector generated income. In real life the productivity of a sector depends on its surplus product. Isnard (1781; xv) argued: :\\"The values of the different products determine the portions of total wealth allotted to the various producers; these portions change with the values of the objects which each producer has to acquire for production\\". According to Fox (2005) Isnard started \\"with a system of the division of labour with only two commodities. Each producer produces a certain amount of one commodity, a part of which he uses as a means of production and as a means of subsistence. He swaps the sectoral surplus for the other commodity he is in need of, but does not produce himself.\\" = Science of man = In his 1781 treatise \\"Trait√© des richesses\\" Isnard proposed a science of man. According to Fox (2012): :\\"In this treatise, Isnard defined the \\"science of man\\" as a kind of mechanics based on the rational decomposition and recomposition of individual interests. Territory as well could be decomposed and recomposed. The creation of the departments at the beginning of the Revolution was nothing else than the result of a decomposition of the old system of regions and its replacement in a process of rationalised recomposition. Engineers, however, applied this method mainly to technical devices, as well as to the process of production which they perceived as a combination of workers' moves giving birth to technical operations.\\"  Works   * Isnard, Achille-Nicolas (1781).

Established in 1924, the lodge was an influential component of the early success of downhill skiing in southwestern Vermont, and is the place where events leading to the founding of both the National Ski Patrol and the United States Army's 10th Mountain Division took place. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. It is a full-service facility, offering accommodations, meals, and activities in all seasons. Description and history Johnny Seesaw's is located in the Green Mountains of northeastern Bennington County, a short way east of the Bromley Mountain Ski Area, on the north side of Vermont Route 11. The main building is a 1-1/2 saddle-notched log structure with a broad gabled roof, with a shed-roofed wing to one side and a frame addition to the rear. Principal features of the front are a large fieldstone chimney, and a single- story porch extending across the front and around to the left side. Attached to one of the rear corners is the home of the lodge's builder, Ivan Sesow, which is now called the Annex. The property includes a number of guest cabins in a variety of styles; the most distinctive is a c. 1954 cabin done in the \\"butterfly\\" style promoted by architect Marcel Breuer. The property has a documented history as an inn dating back to 1835, when Benamin Barnard, Jr. established an inn and tavern at this location. In 1924, John Ivan Sesow, a Russian immigrant who worked in the area's declining lumber industry, purchased the property and built the lodge as a dance hall and entertainment venue. Its design is supposedly based on that of the Russian izba, and was built over three years by Sesow and friends from the lumber camps, using only hand tools. Sesow's Pavilion did well until Prohibition came to an end, and the Great Depression set in. The Sesows abandoned it in 1932, and the property was foreclosed the following year. In 1938, it was purchased by Lew deSchweinitz and Bill and Mary Parrish, who turned it into ski lodge, serving the recently established Bromley Mountain ski area. It was called \\"Johnny Seesaw's\\" in honor of its builder. They built a bunkhouse, and made other additions and alterations over the years. Johnny Seesaw's was visited in its first year by Charles \\"Minnie\\" Dole, the founder of the National Ski Patrol, and hosted celebrities such as aviator Charles Lindbergh and future United States President Gerald Ford. Dole's activities, in addition to founding the ski patrol, included aggressively promoting the development of a military unit specializing in mountain and winter warfare, which eventually became the 10th Mountain Division.

The street is situated in the Midtbyen neighborhood. Skolegade is home to two listed buildings and runs past the Aarhus Theater. Skolegade is an area with many bars and eateries and it has a lively nightlife. The street is from at least medieval times with many historic buildings.  History  Skolegade, 1877 Skolegade is one of the oldest streets in Aarhus. The name is derived from Aarhus Katedralskole which was originally located on the street since it was established in the 1100s. In the old medieval town it was one of the most heavily trafficked streets, used by people from north and east of the town going to the market on Store Torv. In 1849 newspaper articles mention it as the most heavily used street in the city. Into the mid-1800s the gardens of the houses in Skolegade extended to the harbor and coastline. In early times the harbor was only a series of small piers along the river and bay but this changed when Havnegade was established along the coast. Initially as a narrow path and later as a proper street which was first named in 1880. In 1827 the first sea-bath in the city was established in Skolegade 52.  Buildings  Skolegade gets its name from Aarhus Katedralskole which was previously situated on the street. Today the section with the school is a part of Mejlgade resulting in no schools actually being on Skolegade. There are two listed buildings in Skolegade from 1577 and 1802 respectively. The 1577 building was used as a barracks prior to the construction of the Langelandsgade and Vester All√© Barracks in the late 1800s. It has also served as a prison and storehouse. It is a single, long wing facing the street, Half-timbered with a ridged roof. The 1802 building is also a half-timbered structure in a characteristic white/black color scheme.

Six of Crows takes place in the Amsterdam-inspired city of Ketterdam. The new series takes place in the same world as the Grisha books but is set in a different location and time frame. Six of Crows is set in a world loosely inspired by the Dutch Republic of the 17th century, and based on a magical system. The plot is told from the close third-person viewpoints of five different characters, plus a first and last chapter from the point of view of two minor characters. The book is the first in a duology, followed by Crooked Kingdom. Both books are set in the same world and universe as Bardugo's previous \\"Grishaverse\\" trilogy, which includes Shadow and Bone, Siege and Storm and Ruin and Rising. Reading both series will provide a deeper understanding of the Grisha world. Bardugo has since also written The Language of Thorns: Midnight Tales and Dangerous Magic which features several short stories from the Grishaverse, and King of Scars, a spin-off from the \\"Shadow and Bone\\" trilogy.  Summary  Kaz Brekker, a 17-year-old infamous thief known throughout the streets of Ketterdam as \\"Dirtyhands\\", is promised a very large sum of money to rescue Bo Yul-Bayur, a Shu scientist, from the Ice Court in Fjerda. Bo Yul-Bayur has discovered jurda parem, a lethally addictive drug that greatly enhances the powers of the Grisha, people with magical abilities. However, the Ice Court is the most highly protected place in all of Fjerda, and Kaz can't infiltrate it by himself; he needs a crew. He recruits a group of criminals and misfits who each bring a different skillset to the heist. Inej Ghafa is a nimble and stealthy Suli spy whom Kaz rescued from the Menagerie, a brothel. Jesper Fahey is a sharpshooter with a penchant for gambling. Nina Zenik is a Grisha Heartrender from the Ravkan Second Army with the ability to control the bodies of others. Matthias Helvar is a former Fjerdan dr√ºskelle - a Grisha hunter - who was thrown into a heavily protected Kerch jail after being framed by Nina. Wylan Van Eck is a rich merchant's son with some skill at demolition. The task isn't easy, so in order to win, they'll need to work together and put trust in each other. Plot In Ketterdam, the capital of the island nation of Kerch, Councilman Hoede tests a drug called jurda parem, lethal to humans and addictive to Grisha, on Anya, a Grisha Healer indentured to his house. The drug enhances Anya's abilities well over expected, allowing her to control and manipulate human minds as easily as any other muscle (which an ordinary Healer isn't capable of doing); therefore the security measures taken by Hoede to prevent disasters prove insufficient and Anya escapes after paralyzing Hoede and the city guards employed as security, but is eventually found dead in the harbor a few days later. A week after the incident at Councilman Hoede's house, Jan Van Eck, a wealthy merchant, approaches Kaz Brekker, a 17-year-old criminal prodigy and second-in-command of the Dregs (a gang of the Barrel, the most infamous part of Ketterdam), with an impossible task. Van Eck shows Kaz the effects of Hoede's experiment on Anya (the conscious, but mindless city guards), proving what Grisha exposed to jurda parem can do. While the drug enhances the powers of a Grisha, it is highly addictive and the craving has a major debilitating effect on them (which is the reason Anya tried to come back into Ketterdam for a second dose instead of escaping the city). He informs Kaz that the inventor of the drug, Bo Yul-Bayur, is being held in the Ice Court, a military stronghold that has never been breached before situated in the Fjerdan capital Djerholm. Van Eck needs Kaz to rescue the scientist and prevent the secret of jurda parem from getting out into the world, lest it unstabilize the economy. Kaz agrees for the price of thirty million kruge and starts recruiting a crew. First he enlists the help of Inej Ghafa, widely known as the Wraith, his right-hand and spy whom he had saved from a pleasure house called the Menagerie two years before. Next, Kaz seeks out Nina Zenik, a Grisha Heartrender, who agrees when she learns that Kaz also plans to free Matthias Helvar, a former Fjerdan dr√ºskelle (Grisha-hunter) who is currently serving a sentence at Hellgate Prison, for the job. The reason Matthias is detained in Hellgate is Nina's false testimony, and since she first arrived in Ketterdam a year prior she's been trying to make him evade. Along with Inej and Nina, Kaz also brings in Jesper Fahey, a Zemeni sharpshooter with a gambling problem. Together, they manage to break Matthias out of Hellgate. Despite his initial protests, Matthias agrees to help in exchange for a pardon that would enable him to be a dr√ºskelle again. Kaz also recruits Wylan Van Eck, the runaway son of Jan Van Eck, as a demolitions expert but also as the crew's leverage against the latter. As they are about to sail from Ketterdam, the crew is ambushed by rival gangs. They manage to all get safely aboard their ship except for Inej, who is gravely wounded in the skirmish. Kaz rescues her, and upon torturing the man who stabbed her (Oomen), they learn that Pekka Rollins, leader of the Dime Lions (another Barrel gang), is after the scientist as well. Kaz holds a deep grudge against Pekka for running a con on Kaz and his older brother, Jordie, when they were young and new to the city, eventually leading to Jordie's death and setting Kaz on a dark path. Under Nina's care, Inej recovers during the voyage. On the boat, Kaz elaborates the last details of their plan. The plan intends for them to enter the Ice Court as prisoners, then cross to the embassy sector through the roof (as the Ice Court is divided in two rings separated by a moat, and the three sectors of the outer ring, embassy, prison and dr√ºskelle facilities, aren't connected in any other way for security matters), and from there \\"borrow\\" some clothes that will make them look like foreign dignitaries (they are taking advantage of a Fjerdan festival, Hringk√§lla, which will warrant the presence of guests from many other nations), and after finding and freeing Yul-Bayur from the White island (the inner ring), they will exit from the embassy sector. Upon reaching Fjerda, two Grisha on jurda parem bearing the Coin of Passage (a symbol of the Shu government) attack the crew. While they emerge victorious, Nina is shocked to discover that one of the Grisha is an old friend, a boy who served with her in the Second Army in Ravka. However, the Grisha doesn't even recognize her, only begging for more of the drug before succumbing to his wounds. Troubled by the Grisha's deaths and believing they would have survived were they not drastically weakened by the drug, Nina stays behind to bury them. Matthias helps her, giving them time to finally talk about her betrayal. Nina is a Grisha soldier of the Ravkan Second Army who was captured by Matthias and his party, all Fjerdan dr√ºskelle trained to hunt Grisha whom they believe to be unnatural monsters, while on a mission to the Wandering Isle to find and rescue other Grisha. Along with other captured Grisha, Nina was put on a ship bound for Fjerda for her trial and eventual execution. The ship sank during a storm, and only Matthias and Nina survived. Nina was able to free herself of her bonds because of a cup Matthias had earlier given her to drink water from (which is the reason she then saved him when the storm struck). They reached the shore together and helped each other survive until they found their way back to civilization, falling in love along the way. However, when they reached a city (where they were planning to find passage to another state and start a new life together), Nina was recognized by Grisha spies who questioned her about Matthias (having recognized him as a dr√ºskelle). Nina led them to believe she was undercover on a mission and would hand Matthias over to them the next day, truly intending to gain time in order to be able to leave with him. However, they were spotted once more as Matthias tried to book passage for them in the harbor, and to save him, Nina approached a Kerch trader and accused Matthias of being a slave trader, securing safe passage to Kerch but not knowing that Matthias would be thrown in Hellgate as soon as they docked. Instead of going back to Ravka, Nina stayed in Ketterdam to try and free Matthias. Matthias softens upon hearing her story and agrees to help Nina kill Bo Yul-Bayur, as they both agree that jurda parem is a threat to Grisha and Fjerdans alike. The crew intercept a cart of prisoners being taken to the Ice Court and take the place of six of them. Kaz loses consciousness because of the cart being too crowded, and a part of his past is revealed. As a child, after he and his brother were conned by Pekka Rollins, the Lady's Plague swept through Ketterdam, killing many residents of the city including Jordie. Kaz caught the plague but was able to recover. However, he was mistakenly thought for dead and tossed in the Reaper's Barge with the bodies for burning. He was only able to survive by swimming to shore using the dead body of his brother as a buoy. The experience created an intense, lingering aversion to any sort of physical contact with human skin, prompting him to always wear gloves. He wakes up as they enter the Ice Court, discovering that the men Pekka Rollins sent ahead of them have been captured, their bodies mounted on pikes above the courtyard. The crew are split up, as males and females are taken to different cells. After knocking the other prisoners out using a chloro gas, Jesper, who is revealed to be a Grisha Fabrikator, then fashions lock picks from the cell bars using his ability. Kaz unlocks the door, then proceeds to free Nina and Inej from the female section while Matthias and Jesper gather as much rope as they can find. Kaz, however, deviates from the plan and goes with Nina to search the other holding cells for Yul-Bayur, while according to the plan she was meant to go for Matthias. They split up, with Kaz pursuing his own agenda and finding Pekka Rollins in a cell. In the meantime, Nina is spotted by guards, who manage to raise the alarm before she can kill them. She hurries to the basement where the rest of the crew is gathered. By then, Inej has miraculously scaled a six-story incinerator shaft to the roof, securing an escape route for the rest of the crew. Kaz arrives last, and they all manage to get to the roof. With the alarm triggered, their first plan is blown to bits and the crew come up with a new plan to get to the center of the Ice Court, where the scientist should be. Inej and Nina get in by taking the place of two Menagerie girls. However, only Nina gets through the guards; Inej is held back. Matthias and Kaz get in through a secret bridge known only to dr√ºskelle. Jesper and Wylan move on to destroy the ringwall gate and trigger the Ice Court's Black Protocol alarm. While trying to coax information from a Fjerdan official, Nina is shocked to see Jarl Brum, a notorious Fjerdan commander she had presumed to be dead but had apparently also survived the shipwreck that bound her and Matthias together. Nina takes a risk and allows Brum to show her around the prison cells that were especially constructed to detain Grisha. Brum, however, knows who she really is and locks her in a cell. Matthias, who appears to have betrayed her, shows up, but he turns against his old commander and frees Nina, making a sacred Fjerdan dr√ºskelle vow to keep her safe until he dies. They start looking for Bo Yul-Bayur, but they find that the scientist is dead. His son, Kuwei Yul-Bo, is alive and is being forced to replicate his father's research. Matthias and Nina refuse to kill him as he is just a child (fifteen) and also a Grisha, an Inferni. They take the boy and leave, blowing up the lab as they go. They meet up with Kaz, and they all escape through a waterfall unearthed by Kaz upon destroying the sacred ash, the tree at the center of the White Island that is said to carry the voice of Djel (the Fjerdan god). On the other hand, Jesper and Wylan succeed in destroying the gate and triggering the alarm, but are attacked by Shu Tidemakers. Jesper once again Fabrikates metal and ends up killing the Tidemakers. Meanwhile, Inej is spotted by the leader of the Menagerie, her old employer Heleen van Houden (Tante Heleen), who informs the guards of Inej's true identity. The guards march Inej back to prison through a glass corridor. Jesper and Wylan rescue her, and using the diamond Inej stole from Tante Heleen, they cut the glass and hijack a Fjerdan tank. Inej, Jesper, and Wylan use the tank to ram through the walls and escape, eventually rejoining the others who have survived the icy waters of the wellspring and emerged outside the Ice Court. They head toward the dock where they are supposed to rendezvous with their ship, but to their horror, they find a large Fjerdan party waiting for them, a Heartrender at the fore. Without any other choice, Nina takes jurda parem and subdues all of them. Jarl Brum and a team of dr√ºskelle make an appearance, but before she can kill them, Matthias intervenes and begs her to let them live. Nina relents. The crew safely reaches Ketterdam, with Nina already suffering from withdrawal. They leave her behind with Wylan, while the rest of the crew take Kuwei to Jan Van Eck. Van Eck, however, reveals that he only wanted the formula for jurda parem in order to profit from the fallout of its release to the world. He sinks the crew's ship despite Kaz's warning that Wylan is aboard. As it turns out, Van Eck deems his son unfit to inherit his business empire as Wylan is unable to read or write. Kaz, however, still has the upper hand, revealing that the boy Van Eck thinks is Kuwei Yul-Bo is actually Wylan, whom Nina has tailored to look exactly like the scientist's son. Furious, Van Eck kidnaps Inej with the help of Grisha under the influence of jurda parem and gives them seven days to bring him the real Kuwei. Unwilling to endanger Inej, Kaz lets the merchant go. In the final scene, Kaz and his remaining crew go to Pekka Rollins. It is revealed that Kaz had set him free back at the Ice Court, and the man had somehow found his way back to Ketterdam. Kaz sells his shares in the Crow Club and the Fifth Harbour in order to raise the money he needs. Then he starts to hatch a new plan to get Inej‚Äîand the money they were promised‚Äîback. Characters *Kaz Brekker, also known as Dirtyhands, seventeen, a master thief and lock pick with a reputation of doing anything for the right price. He has a personal vendetta against Pekka Rollins, as Rollins swindled a younger Kaz and his late older brother Jordie out of all of their money when they first arrived in Ketterdam. He is a lieutenant of the Dregs, and is considered the de facto leader of the Crows. He is severely touch-phobic, due to a traumatizing incident in his childhood. He is described as having dark hair shaved on the sides and dark brown eyes, always wearing black leather gloves and uses a cane with a crow's head on it to walk. *Inej Ghafa, sixteen, a Suli acrobat known as the Wraith. She is a spy for the Dregs, and is considered the best in Ketterdam. Due to her background as an acrobat, she is extremely agile and lightfooted. She is rather religious and superstitious, and with perhaps the exception of Matthias, is the most religious out of the Crows. She has an aptitude for knives, always carrying around her six favourites (named after Ravkan saints). She was kidnapped and forced to work in a brothel known as the \\"Menagerie\\" until Kaz bought her contract. Since then, she has proven invaluable to Kaz and the Dregs. She's described as being short, having \\"burnt caramel\\" skin and black hair. *Wylan Van Eck, sixteen, a merchant's son with some talent for demolition, whom Kaz takes on as a member of the crew in the hopes of using him as leverage against his father, Jan Van Eck. He is unable to read due to his dyslexia. He is described to have curly red-blonde hair and pale skin. *Matthias Helvar, eighteen, a former dr√ºskelle (witchhunter) from Fjerda. As a child, his entire family, along with most of their village, was killed by Grisha Inferni. He was recruited by Commander Brum shortly thereafter. He has a history with Nina, as the two of them helped each other after a storm destroyed a ship they were both aboard. They trusted each other, until Nina accused him of being a slaver (unbeknownst to Matthias, this was to protect him from Grisha spies). This led to his incarceration at an infamous prison in Ketterdam known as Hellgate. He hates Nina for her betrayal and his initial prejudice against Grisha, but he also loves her and starts to trust her again once he learns more about her background. Kaz frees Matthias from Hellgate because of his knowledge of the Ice Court as well as for his skills as a soldier. *Nina Zenik, seventeen, a powerful Heartrender who worked in a brothel named \\"The White Rose\\". She was a soldier of the Ravkan Second Army who was captured by Fjerdan dr√ºskelle, leading to her first encounter with Matthias. She betrayed his trust to protect him from Grisha spies, choosing to stay in Ketterdam in the hope of finding a way to free him from prison. She was initially recruited by Pekka Rollins to join the Dime Lions, but after meeting Inej, who brought a counteroffer from Kaz, she decided to join the Dregs instead. At \\"The White Rose\\", she specializes in altering her client's moods; she reportedly has a \\"lucrative side business\\" as a Grisha tailor as well, but she does not have much of an aptitude for the field. *Jesper Fahey, seventeen, a dark-skinned Zemeni sharpshooter with a gambling problem. He is described as being tall and lanky, with an intense facial bone structure. It is revealed he is a Fabrikator (Durast) as well later in the plot. His father believes that he is studying in a university at Ketterdam. *Jan Van Eck, a rich and prominent merchant who sits on Ketterdam's Merchant Council. He makes a deal with Kaz Brekker to retrieve the creator of jurda parem from the Ice Court. *Pekka Rollins, Kaz's ultimate adversary after he conned him and ruined his life. He is the rich owner of a successful casino in Ketterdam and is always up to no good in one way or the other. Uses the alias Jakob Hertzoon to con Kaz Brekker.  Reception  Prior to its publication, The Hollywood Reporter described the duology: > \\"The project, described as a blend of Ocean's 11 and Game of Thrones, is set > in Kerch, a small island nation in the \\"Grishaverse\\" (meaning the same > universe as her Shadow and Bone books) with tremendous economic power, the > hub of all international trade and a country rich in art and culture, but > also home to a teeming criminal underworld. A crew of dangerous misfits face > impossible odds when they are pulled together to break into one of the most > guarded places in the world.\\" The New York Times recommends Six of Crows in the YA Crossover shortlist: \\"There‚Äôs conflict between morality and amorality and an appetite for sometimes grimace-inducing violence that recalls the ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù series. But for every bloody exchange there are pages of crackling dialogue and sumptuous description. Bardugo dives deep into this world, with full color and sound.

It is fast-paced with an urgency in the change of point of views and plot twists throughout the book. It is further added that although the book is structured to the typical format, it is rather unpredictable as it transcends towards the end. NPR books criticized the characters, claiming that the characters do not behave or think like adolescents, but rather display the wisdom and traits of much older people. Kirkus Reviews recommends the \\"cracking page-turner with a multiethnic band of misfits with differing sexual orientations who satisfyingly, believably jell into a family.\\" According to The Times of India, different perspectives in the book each provide an in-depth view of the each character's traits and backgrounds. It further says, \\"Bardugo's language and her intelligent storytelling effectively makes The Six of Crows a white-knuckle page-turner.\\"  Adaptations  In January 2019, Netflix greenlit an eight-episode series based on Shadow and Bone (The Grisha Trilogy Book 1) and Six of Crows with Eric Heisserer as showrunner. Bardugo is also serving as an executive producer on this series. Production began in October 2019 with Freddy Carter as Kaz Brekker, Amita Suman as Inej Ghafa, Kit Young as Jesper Fahey, Danielle Galligan as Nina Zenik, and Calahan Skogman as Matthias Helvar. The first season will serve as Book 1 of Shadow and Bone and a prequel to Six of Crows.

Life Michael Leyser was born in Leipzig in 1626. His father was the theologian Polykarp Leyser II (1586-1633). There were a number of members of the Leyser family who achieved notability during this period, but Michael would be unusual among them in not becoming a theologian. His mother, Sabine, was the daughter of Nikolaus Volckmar (1573-1602), a book dealer who at one stage served as the major of Leipzig. Michael Leyser began his university career studying Philosophy at Wittenberg, later transferring to Leipzig University where he received his Magister degree in Philosophy. He then switched to Medicine, studying under Thomas Bartholin at Copenhagen, where he mastered the full range of knowledge and experience on the subject of Anatomy. Under the guidance of Bartholin he prepared human skeletons, making them exceptionally clean and white. Bartholin had him appointed Assessor and Pro- rector: Leyser went on to become as one of the most able anatomists of his generation. At his teacher's instigation, in 1653 he set out the medical requirements and rules which were established among Anatomy teachers, which he published under the title '\\"Culter anatomicus. Hoc est: Methodus brecis, facilis ac perspicua artificose et compendiose humana incidendi cadavera\\"'. The book had been republished five times by 1731, and also been translated from Latin into German and English. In this way he disseminated knowledge that had hitherto been held within a restrict circle of experts, but he did not stop there. In the vicious dispute between Batholin and Olaus Rudbeck over who deserved credit for vital discoveries regarding the Lymphatic system, Rudbeck got to the point of asserting that the person who really deserved the credit was Michael Leyser, for whose discoveries Bartholin had appropriated the credit by publishing the results under his own name. After publishing his book in 1653 Leyser seems to have abandoned his university career at Copenhagen. Around 1656 he probably moved to Padua where he received his Doctor of Medicine qualification, before returning to Denmark. Here he moved to Lolland and M√∏n, then setting up in practice as a physician between those two islands at Nyk√∏bing on Falster. It was here that he died, shortly after his marriage, still aged only about 34, on 20 December 1660. The illness that killed him is identified as a \\" \\"Febris maligna\\", a \\"cold fever\\" probably caused by Typhus or Plague.  Output (not a complete list)  * Calculo renum et vesice.

Reclaimed water is treated wastewater that comes from homes and businesses, such as sink water, shower water, and even toilet water; this includes everything dumped down these wastewater drains from laundry soap to bleach to oil to human waste. Wastewater can divided into greywater and blackwater, with the first being defined as water that had been used for laundry, bathing, sink washing, and dishwaters. Blackwater, on the other hand, is defined as sewage that includes feces from toilets. Due to the low amounts of physical pollutants in greywater, most of its contaminants are dissolved organic matter, which can be physically filtered and cleaned through various membranes, as well as through biological treatment methods. The subsequent heterogeneous solution is collected through pipes and the sewer system, and is then treated at a wastewater treatment plant to the standard required according to its intended use. Historically, this recycled water has been used for agriculture, large-scale landscaping, industrial processes like cooling systems, and groundwater recharge. As we look to the future, we can expect to see new infrastructure for water reuse to include washing our laundry and cars or watering our lawns and even flushing our toilets, in addition to use in municipal infrastructure for street cleaning, fountains, and commercial use. Water in California is to be used 'reasonably' under the Reasonable Use doctrine, and not reusing water when possible constitutes a violation of this doctrine pursuant to Water Code sections 13550 et seq. according to the State Water Resources Control Board. Water reuse in California has more than tripled since the 1970s, growing from less than 200,000 acre-feet per year to nearly 700,000 in 2009.  History  Water is a limiting factor to both economic and population growth in California. As such, Californians have been reusing water for much of its history. As early as the 1800s, California farmers were using municipal wastewater from nearby urban areas for irrigation. In the early 1900s, the city of Pasadena purchased a plot of land outside the city and named it Pasadena Sewer Farm, where walnuts, corn, pumpkins, and hay were grown at a profit. Other cities in the state began using sewage for irrigation, too, recognizing it as a source of water and nutrients in an arid California. Around the same time, the city of San Francisco began using raw sewage for irrigation of Golden Gate Park, an area which was just sand dunes at the time, and is now a lush garden-of-eden-esqe meadow. Similar stories can be found of cities around the state. Concerns were raised about public health risks of using sewage for irrigation eventually leading to the first state law regarding the reuse of municipal wastewater in 1918. After building a treatment plant near Golden Gate Park, artificial lakes and streams were also created with the treated water. In Fresno, in the 1920s, the state's first potable groundwater recharge system using wastewater was established. After World War II, the population of Southern California increased dramatically, and groundwater in the area had been over-exploited to the point of creating saltwater intrusion from the Pacific Ocean, rendering the local groundwater non-potable. In their attempt to develop technology to desalinate ocean water, engineers discovered that their technology was more efficient and cost- effective when applied on brackish water. The advent of plastic allowed for even greater advancements in water reuse, and enabled the invention of reverse osmosis in 1959 by two UCLA students, Sidney Loeb and Srinivasa Sourirajan. In 1961, a wastewater treatment plant was opened in Los Angeles, where reverse osmosis was used to treat sewage and stormwater. The treated water was applied to a sandy basin, where it was further treated by natural means and percolated down into the groundwater, which was in turn pumped back up for use as drinking water. In 1965, San Diego County created man-made lakes using treated sewage for recreational activities, including swimming and fishing. And in 1976, with their groundwater contaminated by saltwater intrusion, Orange County opened Water Factory 21, where they used reverse osmosis to treat wastewater, and then inject it into the ground to be used as a hydraulic saltwater barrier for the area's overdrawn groundwater aquifers. Since the 1970s, water reuse has more than tripled. In 2013, San Diego demonstrated the feasibility of using technology to recycle most of their wastewater for reuse by the year 2035, to decrease costs of importing water. This project, Pure Water San Diego, hopes to build facilities throughout the county to treat wastewater to provide for sustainable, safe potable water for one-third of the population. As of 2011, the city has been purifying millions of gallons of water and giving demonstrations to the public upon request.  Technology  = Early technology = The earliest water reuse comprised simply of trenches dug to transport wastewater outside of urban areas to farms where it was used for fertilizer and water. Pipes were soon built to contain the smell of the wastewater. In the 1930s, San Francisco built McQueen Treatment Plant near Golden Gate Park to treat the wastewater it was using to irrigate the landscape. This technology included aerating the wastewater to allow bacteria to work on the effluent, as well as adding chlorine to kill off any remaining pathogens. = Treatment levels = * Primary: A physical process of removing solids from the heterogenous solution, but will still have organic material. * Secondary: Biological process of removing organic matter and suspended material. * Tertiary: Can involve physical and chemical processes to further remove organic matter, suspended material, and nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Physical treatments include coarse sand, sedimentation, and screening through membranes and filters. Chemical treatments include ion exchange and coagulation. Biological processes include the use of ultraviolet for disinfection, membrane bioreactors, RBC, and SBR. = Reverse osmosis = Reverse osmosis is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water. Currently, reverse osmosis is the technology by which water reuse is made possible, in conjunction with filtering methods for larger solids (e.g., screens and settling tanks), other techniques for removing smaller particulates (e.g., aeration to allow bacteria to metabolize the suspended matter), and chlorination to kill any remaining harmful bacteria. Reverse osmosis can also remove dissolved solids, color, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens. = Other = Other methods for treating water include UV disinfection, oxidation, and electrodialysis reversal for salinity.  Current uses and applications  Water reuse has been an important part of California's water plan due to efforts to reduce over-drafted ground and surface water supplies, but also as a safe and environmentally responsible means of waste disposal. It also helps to address the unique challenge that California faces in providing water to its densely populated cities and millions of acres of farmland in areas where precipitation scarcely falls. In 2012, California reused nearly three quarters of a million acre feet of water, enough for about three million Californians for the year. 456x456px = Irrigation = Irrigation of farms and landscapes accounts for the greatest use of recycled water in California, more than 60%, with agriculture alone accounting for nearly 40%. Given that agriculture uses 80% of developed water supply in California, this greatly reduces strain on natural freshwater supplies. Water must be treated to at least the secondary level in order to be used in agriculture in California. In cases where the recycled water will not have contact with the edible portion of the plant, like in orchards or vineyards, secondary treatment is deemed sufficient, but in the case of crops with the edible portion of the plant having contact with the recycled water tertiary treatment is regulated. = Groundwater recharge = The second largest use of recycled water in California is groundwater recharge. To some extent, water reuse as a seawater intrusion barrier is also groundwater recharge. Treated wastewater is injected into underground aquifers, or in some cases spread over a surface of land and allowed to percolate down into aquifers below, where it can later be extracted to be added to the urban water supply. Groundwater recharge is regulated by the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), California Department of Public Health (DPH), California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). There are currently four large-scale groundwater recharge operations in southern California that inject treated wastewater directly into potable water aquifers. They include Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System, West Basin Municipal Water District Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility, Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation Terminal Island Water Reclamation Plant, and the Water Replenishment District of Southern California Leo J. Vander Lans Water Treatment Facility. In contrast, the Montebello Forebay facility spreads water on the surface of the ground to recharge the aquifer. = Industrial use = Use of recycled water in industrial settings is increasing as strained freshwater supplies are decreasing. Recycled water is used industrially in pulp and paper plants and in the cooling towers and boilers of power plants. It can also be used for mixing concrete and other applications that do not involve consumption by humans. This is an attractive option for California industries, given the high cost of unrecycled fresh water. Additionally, water need not be treated to very high standards to be use in industrial applications, and this makes it an even more cost-effective solution. West Basin Municipal Water District's Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility has been providing recycled water to industrial customers since 1995. = Ecosystem support = Treated wastewater is used in California to support aquatic ecosystems, like wetlands, rivers, and lakes. This can be for the purposes of habitat restoration, water flow augmentations, and water quantity and quality maintenance. Lake Elsinore of Lake Elsinore City loses 14,000 acre feet of water a year from evaporation, and in 2002 the city decided to augment the dwindling lake with recycled water.  Challenges  = Technical = There are some technical challenges in water reuse, among which are making start-up more economical, questions about water quality standards, long-term effects of pharmaceutical and household chemicals leftover in the water after treatment (constituents of emerging concern), and a lack of infrastructure to carry out water reuse. Although there has been little documentation of adverse effects to humans from water reuse contact or consumption, there remains concern about long-term effects of endocrine disrupters, pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and personal care products in reused water, including impacts on the natural and beneficial microbiota found on and inside people. Treating water to a degree that would be free of these contaminants is expensive, and, for recycled water that is introduced into a groundwater aquifer, it would include the use of multiple barriers and mediums for removal of the microbiological and chemical contaminants. Furthermore, all wastewater that is added to the groundwater supply must be highly treated just in case it has these potentially dangerous contaminants. Monitoring is a critical step in these processes as well. In September 2016, the California State Water Resources Control Board published a report for public comment entitled, \\"Investigation on the Feasibility of Developing Uniform Water Recycling Criteria for Direct Potable Reuse\\". Among many other points, this report clearly states that there is no established and reliable technology to even measure these 'constituents of emerging concern' collectively, as opposed to one by one with expensive techniques, and they cannot be effectively monitored via Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), or Total Organic Carbon (TOC). A better alternative to preemptively highly treating all water in case of contaminants for use in the drinking water supply may be to have a dual piping system, in which gray and black water are kept separate from the initial point of disposal to the treatment phase and the treated blackwater is used for non-potable reuses, as it is more likely to have higher concentrations of the potentially more harmful contaminants, while the treated graywater can be used for more sensitive purposes. For example, the blackwater from toilets can be kept separate, be treated to the point that it no longer has odor, color or pathogens, and be reused to flush the same toilets indefinitely, in a closed- loop system, remembering that no one touches or consumes the water in the toilet bowl. Other closed-loop recycling systems would also be entirely feasible, for example in laundries and car washes. This requires costly new infrastructure, but it will pay for itself via savings in water and health. The general consensus is that new infrastructure will be required regardless moving into the next few decades. = Social = People are naturally concerned with water reuse, and the concept of contagions in the water is difficult to overcome. Water after just one use has long been considered waste, but, as water resources decline in the face of increasing populations, this mindset will need to be changed, because water reuse will continue to be implemented on a greater scale. Education will be an important factor in addressing these social challenges. In fact, the City of San Diego Water Purification Demonstration Project spent nearly half of its budget on public outreach and education in 2005.  Economics  The geographical inequity in the distribution of water and precipitation in California makes it such that water reuse is more economical in the southern half, which receives less than one third of the precipitation of the state. In the face of groundwater overdraft, declining snowpack, changing climate, increased drought and high temperatures, some Southern California cities have found water reuse to be a cost-effective way to augment their water supply. The initial costs of building a wastewater treatment plant can be more expensive than other methods of attaining water (e.g., groundwater or imported water), but it's much less costly than desalination. Once the facility is established, however, recycled water is less expensive than fresh, for use in industry or power generation. Furthermore, as freshwater supplies continue to dwindle, the cost of freshwater will go up, and the price differential will increase. It is also important to note that the cost of treating water goes up as the level of treatment goes up. This means that it is more economically viable to treat water for irrigation purposes than for potable uses. In fact, in some cases, recycled water can reduce the need for fertilizers, further adding to the viability of water reuse.  Future  The future of water reuse in California is expansion. With the population of California expected to nearly double by 2055 and with the anticipated effects of climate change in an already water- strained state, water reuse will continue to be an integral part of California's water story. The State Water Resources Control Board has laid out plans for the increased \\"use of recycled water over 2002 levels by at least one million acre-feet per year (AFY) by 2020 and by at least two million AFY by 2030.\\" The DWR reviews and updates the California Water Plan every 5 years. Currently, priority funding is given to new projects in the state that incorporate water reuse.

Given abilities that control the environment around him, our silent protagonist is never allowed to use them in inventive or even organic ways.\\" He gave the game a score of 50/100.http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/soul_axiom Reviewing the Early Access version, Mike Cosimano from Destructoid said: \\"Soul Axiom is an unsettling and compelling techno/cyber-thriller, with a killer visual style that matches its high-concept premise. Whether it actually delivers on its many promises is another thing entirely, but there‚Äôs a lot to be excited about so far.\\"http://www.destructoid.com/soul-axiom-is-a-cross-between-journey-and- tron-288643.phtml However, Joe Parlock reviewed the final version for Destructoid and gave the game its worst Metacritic score to date, 25/100.https://www.destructoid.com/review-soul-axiom-342376.phtml Borja 'VodKaVK' Martos from GameGrin wrote: \\"The treatment of the soul and the afterlife is not disappointing, but the context in which these ideas are brought up are.

Davenport wrote \\"Soul Axiom wants to be a huge, cerebral puzzle game. I admire the scope and variety of its modular environments, each with completely different aesthetics and puzzle mechanics ... Soul Axiom nearly gets by on intrigue. For the first two hours, however inconsistent, I was curious to explore the varied environments and play around with the shallow puzzles.\\"http://www.pcgamer.com/soul-axiom-review/ Jordan Helm from Hardcore Gamer compared the game to Tron, Bioshock and The Talos Principle and wrote: \\"Simplistic and often jarring its intended design may seem, Soul Axiom is a game that requires, as much cunningly desires, the player‚Äôs warranted need to look beyond the surface that‚Äôs initially presented. Whether that be in its puzzle design or the ample conflict of environments, Wales Interactive do just enough with the overarching themes of simulation and replication to make its superficial locales feel that extra bit suspicious.\\" The review ended with a score of 3.5/5.http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/02/29/review-soul- axiom/195373/ Pavel Valek from games.cz gave the game a 40/100: \\"If you expect a fun puzzle game, you have to look elsewhere. Soul Axiom offers plenty of easy levels and dull puzzles that will resolve themselves.\\"http://games.tiscali.cz/recenze/soul-axiom-recenze-271796 Peter Parrish from PC Invasion gave the game 7/10: \\"As a consequence of action sequences being a bit clunky, Soul Axiom's final encounter is a bit of a let down,\\" and concluded with, \\"Soul Axiom consistently finds new and engaging ways for the player to use the same set of powers to overcome obstacles, and does an able job weaving its (justifiably) fragmented story throughout the game‚Äôs hub structure.\\"http://www.pcinvasion.com/soul-axiom-review References External links * Category:First-person adventure games Category:2016 video games Category:Windows games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Xbox One games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Soul Axiom"},{"id":"49461780","text":"BEIC digital library.)

They had a daughter, Beatrice St. Julien Ravenel, who would go on to become a writer on architecture and Charleston history. The couple lived south of Charleston, initially supported mainly by the fortune left to Ravenel by her father, and during this period Ravenel wrote little. Ravenel's husband died in 1920, and in 1926 she remarried. Her second husband was Samuel Prioleau Ravenel, a second cousin of her first husband. Writing Ravenel took up writing poetry again in the late 1910s, but she only returned to writing full-time out of necessity after Frank's death, by which time little of her inheritance was left due to his bad investments. Ravenel supported herself and her daughter by writing fiction for publications like Harper's Magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, and Ainslee's Magazine. One of the stories she wrote in this period was republished as an O. Henry Memorial Prize story. She also wrote editorials for newspapers edited by her brother-in-law William Watts Ball, including The State and the Post and Courier. Ravenel originally wrote poems in a late Victorian sentimental mode, but after exposure to modernist‚Äîand especially Imagist‚Äîpoets in the early 1920s through her founding membership in the South Carolina Poetry Society, she began writing a dramatically different kind of free verse notable for its vivid imagery and precise language. She became a friend of such modernist poets as Amy Lowell, who advised her on the sole book of poems published in her lifetime, The Arrow of Lightning (1926). She published her poems in Poetry and Contemporary Verse magazines, the North American Review, the Sewanee Review, and elsewhere. By the late 1920s, she had published some 50 short stories and 80 poems in various outlets. Some of Ravenel's best poetry was inspired by the South Carolina Lowcountry where she lived, especially the lives of the local Yemasee Indians. One critic notices that although she evokes history like many of the Charleston Renaissance writers, it is not in the typical nostaligizing vein for a lost antebellum world; instead, she insistently gives voice to those forgotten by history: Native Americans, soldiers, mothers, pirates, slaves. Several authors hold her work to be superior to that of her better-known peers. Literary scholar Louis D. Rubin, Jr., who edited a 1969 volume of her works, wrote that her work was \\"better than any other poetry being written in the South during the 1920s outside of Nashville.\\" Her obscurity may be due in part to her own withdrawal from writing and in part due to a general neglect of southern women writers by literary scholars. Recent scholarship places her as a key literary figure in the Charleston Renaissance, along with fellow writers Josephine Pinckney, Julia Peterkin, DuBose Heyward, Dorothy Heyward, and Hervey Allen. Later life Ravenel's second marriage (in 1926) brought her renewed financial stability. She traveled widely and wrote little, though she did produce one sequence on the West Indies that was only published long after her death. Ravenel died on March 15, 1956, sixteen years after Samuel. Her papers‚Äîincluding manuscripts, letters, scrapbooks, and sketchbooks‚Äîare held by the University of North Carolina. Publications *The Arrow of Lightning (1926) *The Yemasee Lands (1969; ed.

The headmistress is Mrs Donna Russell as of 2019. The school is a Church of England school. The school was built in 1871 as part of Trinity Church, which was built in 1868. The school was expanded in 1879 with a large room and three classrooms added and was of the same design as the church, with both being designed by Norman Shaw. The older parts of the school were designated as Grade II listed in 1973. Despite the original 1868 church being demolished in 1974, the school continued to operate albeit with a brief interruption during the demolition process when pupils were temporarily allocated to other schools in Bingley. Planning permission was given to expand the school in 2013. This will increase pupil numbers from 330 to 420.

Holmes Sr. (January 17, 1883‚Äì June 10, 1945) was born in Hobbs Island, Alabama. He became the inventor of the first tow truck when he fastened various parts to his 1913 Cadillac. He then founded Ernest Holmes Co, which still spiritually lives on through Miller Industries. He later would also serve a term as a member of the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga and the American Society of Automotive Engineers .  The birth of an idea  Holmes got the idea after assisting a friend of his from business school, John Wiley, after Wiley's Model T flipped over into a ditch. Holmes then modified his 1913 Cadillac to pull cars and transport them to his garage by affixing an iron chain, a pulley, and several poles to the back of his Cadillac. Holmes quickly patented his invention, and thus the towing industry was born. He spent the next two years theorizing and forming a concrete idea, filing his patent on January 17, 1918. The basis for Ernest Holmes Sr.'s patents was the unique concept of having a \\"split-boom\\" wrecker that could anchor the truck on one side, and retrieve from the other side without tilting the wrecker. This was especially useful when a wrecked vehicle had gone down a steep embankment.  Death  Many would have said he was in stout health shortly before his death; sources say he went to a local course for a round of golf and then a bridge game the next day on Saturday. He was absolutely passionate about golf, never going a week without golfing unless he was traveling on business. At 4 o'clock on the morning of June 10, 1945, he woke his wife feeling unwell and dying shortly after that at the age of 62. Doctors declared that he had suffered from what they called a \\"heart aliment\\". His oldest child, Ernest Holmes Jr. was then swiftly elected to take over control of Holmes Co. Holmes had said he would retire when he turned 65.Replica of Ernest Holmes's original wrecker in the International Towing & Recovery Museum  Other fields in which the wrecker was used  A few wreckers were sold directly to the United States Government at the tail end of World War I, to be outfitted for military usage. They would be used in full force during the second World War were in which Holmes Co supplied the Allies with 6 to 7 thousand military tier wreckers. The regular wrecker was used in the American racing industry as it was the wrecker of choice for both NASCAR and IndyCar racing for multiple decades.It is on the original site of Holmes's garage and later his workshop that assembled his wreckers  Impact of Holmes  Holmes Family Headstone Holmes' invention has become the leading vehicle in rescuing and transporting of vehicles that can't be driven at the current time. The International Towing & Recovery Hall of Fame & Museum was built in Chattanooga. It is a home to a collection and history of the tow truck and how it has evolved since its inception in the early 20th century. What was left of the Ernest Holmes Company, at that time owned by Dover, transformed into Miller Industries under the supervisor of his son Mildred Holmes.

According to Kryshtanovskaya, there was no capture of power as Kremlin bureaucracy has called siloviks in order to \\"restore order\\". The process of siloviks coming into power has allegedly started since 1996, Boris Yeltsin's second term. \\"Not personally Yeltsin, but the whole elite wished to stop the revolutionary process and consolidate the power.\\" When silovik Vladimir Putin was appointed Prime Minister in 1999, the process was boosted. According to Olga, \\"Yes, Putin has brought siloviks with him. But that's not enough to understand the situation. Here's also an objective aspect: the whole political class wished them to come. They were called for service... There was a need of a strong arm, capable from point of view of the elite to establish order in the country.\\" Kryshtanovskaya has also noted that there were people who had worked in structures \\"affiliated\\" with KGB/FSB. Structures usually considered as such are the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Governmental Communications Commission, Ministry of Foreign Trade, Press Agency News and others. \\"The itself work in such agencies doesn't involve necessary contacts with special services, but makes to think about it.\\"Fradkov: jacket over straps, by Olga Kryshtanovskaya, 2004 (in Russian) Summing up numbers of official and \\"affiliated\\" siloviks she got an estimate of 77% of such in the power. = Putin‚Äôs Amendments to the Russian Constitution 2020= With Putin‚Äôs signing an executive order on July 3, 2020 to officially insert the amendments into the Russian Constitution, they took effect on July 4, 2020 Vladimir Putin.Putin signing amendments into law History =Intelligence state= According to former Securitate general Ion Mihai Pacepa, \\"In the Soviet Union, the KGB was a state within a state.

Former KGB officer Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy shares similar ideas. When asked \\"How many people in Russia work in FSB?\\", he replied: \\"Whole country.

A Rogue Intelligence State? Why Europe and America Cannot Ignore Russia By Reuel Marc Gerecht =Corporation- state= Some economists consider the political system in Russia as a variety of corporatism. According to Andrei Illarionov, a former advisor of Vladimir Putin, this is a new socio-political order, \\"distinct from any seen in our country before\\". He said that members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators took over the entire body of state power, follow an omerta-like behavior code, and \\"are given instruments conferring power over others ‚Äì membership ‚Äúperks‚Äù, such as the right to carry and use weapons\\". According to Illarionov, this \\"Corporation has seized key government agencies ‚Äì the Tax Service, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Parliament, and the government-controlled mass media ‚Äì which are now used to advance the interests of [Corporation] members. Through these agencies, every significant resource of the country ‚Äì security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial ‚Äì is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members\\".Andrei Illarionov: Approaching Zimbabwe (Russian) Partial English translation Members of the Corporation created an isolated caste. A former KGB general said that \\"a Chekist is a breed... A good KGB heritage‚Äîa father or grandfather, say, who worked for the service‚Äîis highly valued by today's siloviki.

The title is an allusion to work \\"Imperialism as the last and culminating stage of capitalism\\" by Vladimir Lenin He believes that \\"Russia is not corrupt. Corruption is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today‚Äôs Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people. They have privatized the country‚Äôs wealth and taken control of its financial flows.\\" Review of Andrei's Pionkovsky's Another Look Into Putin's Soul by the Honorable Rodric Braithwaite, Hoover Institute Such views are also shared by politologist Julie Anderson who said the same person can be a Russian intelligence officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman. She also cited former CIA director James Woolsey who said: \\"I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to strike up a conversation with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and wants to talk to you about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement.\\" (Congressional Statement of R. James Woolsey, Former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, 21 September 1999, Hearing on the Bank of New York and Russian Money Laundering) According to politologist Glinsky, \\"The idea of Russia, Inc.or better, Russia, Ltd.derives from the Russian brand of libertarian anarchism viewing the state as just another private armed gang claiming special rights on the basis of its unusual power.\\" \\"This is a state conceived as a \\"stationary bandit\\" imposing stability by eliminating the roving bandits of the previous era.\\", he said. In April 2006, the effectively privatization of the customs sphere infuriated Putin himself, where businessmen and officials \\"merged in ecstasy\\". Ideology Some observers discuss ideology of new Russian political elite. Politologist Irina Pavlova said that chekists are not merely a corporation of people united to expropriate financial assets. They have long-standing political objectives of transforming Moscow to the Third Rome and ideology of \\"containing\\" the United States. Badly informed optimists, by Irina Pavlova, grani.ru Columnist George Will emphasized the nationalistic nature of Putinism. He said that \\"Putinism is becoming a toxic brew of nationalism directed against neighboring nations, and populist envy, backed by assaults of state power, directed against private wealth. Putinism is a national socialism without the demonic element of its pioneer...\\". According to Illarionov, the ideology of chekists is Nashism (‚Äúours-ism‚Äù), the selective application of rights\\". In March 2020, Vyacheslav Volodin, the Chairman of the State Duma, emphasized Vladimir Putin's special ideological role: \\"Today, facing the current challenges and the threats that exist in the world, oil and gas are not our advantages. As you can see, both oil and gas can fall in price. Our strength is Mr. Putin, and we must protect him\\". In 2010 Peter Sucia, the American historian and The National Interest contributor, was one of the first publicists to explicitly describe Mr. Putin as a leader who's sincerely convinced in his fascist values as righteous. Sucia wrote: \\"Some historians and economists have noted that fascism is actually an anti-Marxist form of socialism, especially as it favors class collaboration and supports the concept of nationalism ‚Äî the latter being something that Marxists could never support. A diehard Marxist leader wouldn't get on a plane and fly halfway around the world to try and win support for the Olympics to be hosted in his country, even his hometown. But a tried and true Fascist might do so\\". *  See also  * Russia under Vladimir Putin * Yeltsinism * Stalinism * Gaullism * Peronism * Erdoganism References Further reading *Putin‚Äôs Militocracy by Olga Kryshtanovskaya and Stephen White *Russia under Putin.

According to Turkish authorities, the attack targeted a convoy of shuttles carrying both civilian and military personnel working at the military headquarters during the evening rush hour as the vehicles were stopped at traffic lights at an intersection with ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º Boulevard close to Kƒ±zƒ±lay neighborhood. Several ministries, the headquarters of the army and the Turkish Parliament are located in the neighbourhood where the attack occurred. The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) took responsibility for the attack and said they targeted security forces. Censorship monitoring organization Turkey Blocks reported nationwide internet restrictions beginning approximately one hour after the blast pursuant to an administrative order. Background In October 2015, a bombing at a peace rally in Ankara against a crackdown on Kurds in the country amidst the renewed PKK rebellion following a breakdown of the ceasefire killed over 100 people. On 13 February, Turkish shelling of Kurdish positions in response to \\"incoming Kurdish fire\\" and against the backdrop of YPG territorial gains in northern Syria led, at the request of Russia, to a UN briefing in which the president of the United Nations Security Council Rafael Carreno said that all members during the closed-door meeting expressed their concern at Turkey's actions and called on the country to \\"comply with international law\\". Following the UNSC vote and just hours before the bombing, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, referred to PYD as a \\"terrorist organisation\\" akin to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), DHKP-C and Al-Nusra Front and stressed that the attacks against PYD's armed wing, YPG, will continue until it stops alleged threats against Turkey's national security. Bombings A car bomb detonated at 18:31 local time, while army buses carrying military personnel were waiting at traffic lights. The attack site was next to a residential block for high-ranking military personnel. Some Turkish news channels showed images of a raging fire that engulfed military vehicles after the explosion, heard several kilometres away. Casualties At least 30 people, including the perpetrator, died and 60 were injured as a result of the blast. The initial dead included the perpetrator, 12 soldiers, 16 civilian employees of the military and a journalist. Another civilian died from his wounds in hospital on 23 February 2016. A list of the first dead was published on 18 February. Assailant Initially, Turkish government declared the name of assailant as Salih Necar, a Syrian Kurd who was trained by YPG, PKK and Syrian government. Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility and named the suicide bomber as Abd√ºlbaki S√∂nmez and released a photo of him, which was later claimed to be an edited image of a Turkish blogger. Later, DNA reports confirmed that perpetrator was Turkish-born Abdulbaki S√∂nmez, not Syrian-born Salih Necar who was shown as perpetrator to the world by Turkish prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Also, Syrian Kurdish authorities announced that a person named Salih Necar from Hasakah doesn't exist. After DNA reports Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Numan Kurtulmu≈ü said that \\"the name of the perpetrator may be different but it does not change the reality of this matter. This person has entered Turkey from the PYD region and there is record of him assuming the given identity.\\".http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/02/24/pyd-involvement-in- ankara-bombing-unquestionable Turkish government is claiming that YPG, taking orders from PKK, is responsible from the massacre, and TAK is used as a way to \\"exonerate\\" the YPG.http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/02/23/syrian-ypg- takes-orders-from-pkk-pm-davutoglu-says Turkish government is also worried about NATO allies of support of YPG, prime minister Davutoƒülu said ‚ÄúWe cannot excuse any NATO ally, including the US, of having links with a terrorist organisation [YPG] that strikes us in the heart of Turkey‚Äù. Turkish authorities claimed that the perpetrator was trained as a suicide bomber in Syrian Rojava by YPG and entered Turkey as a refugee. Turkey claims that the attack was planned by the YPG, PKK, PYD and the Syrian government. The suicide bomber was eventually confirmed as Abd√ºlbaki S√∂nmez, a citizen of Turkey. Reactions Thousands at protests all over Turkey =Domestic= Attack shared by social media users post pictures President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan issued a statement. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu cancelled planned trips to Belgium and Azerbaijan following the attack. Spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party √ñmer √áelik said he condemned the attacks. Erdogan vowed retaliation against the perpetrators of the attack while Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu≈ü called it an attack on the \\"nation as a whole\\". Oppositional Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) co-leader Selahattin Demirta≈ü condemned the bombing as a \\"merciless attack\\" and wished \\"God‚Äôs mercy upon those who lost their lives\\". The Turkish Parliament failed to make a unanimous declaration. The pro-Kurdish and pro-minority HDP party condemned the bombing, with parliamentary chair ƒ∞dris Baluken referring to it as a \\"loathsome attack\\"; the party disagreed with the unilaterally drafted text. The declaration was finally released by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), and opposition CHP and MHP parties. =International= An EU summit in Brussels that was to focus on the issues of migrants was cancelled following the bombing. World leaders, including those from Germany, the United Kingdom and United States condemned the attack.

He is furthermore noted for being the Russian signatory to the Treaty of Gulistan which was concluded with Qajar Iran in 1813. Biography Nikolay Rtishchev was born into a Russian family with an ancient lineage. After having finished education at the Infantry Cadet Corps, he started serving as a lieutenant of the regular army on 27 July 1773, and became adjudant to General Field Marshal Zakhar Chernyshev on 11 October. From this point on, Rtishchev would rapidly rise through the military ranks. He became second Major of the 2nd Grenadier Regiment about 6 years later, on 11 October 1779, and ended his career as adjudant to Chernyshev on 15 September 1784, when he became colonel (polkovnik) in the Navaginsk Infantry Regiment. On 2 May 1789, he became brigadier in the St.Petersburg Brigadier Regiment. Rtishchev served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788-1790, and for his merits, he earned the Gold Sword for Bravery. On 12 January, 1793, he was promoted to major general and subsequently served in Poland where the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising was taking place. In 1798, he became a lieutenant general, commandant of Astrakhan, and on 5 April 1798, the chef of the Astrakhan Garrison Regiment. His service in Astrakhan was very short lived however, for he retired from that duty later that same year, and returned to the main army on 15 April 1806. On 9 October 1809, Rtishchev took command of the 16th Division, and gained the Order of St. Anna (1st class). He took part in the campaigns in the Danubian Principalities between 1807-1809. On 27 May 1809 he took command of the 25th Division and participated against Austria later in that year. For his efforts during the campaign, he received the Order of St. George (4th class) on 8 December 1810. On 19 July 1811, he became the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian forces on the Caucasian Line. The following year, he was promoted to Russian commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, a position otherwise known as head of the Caucasus Viceroyalty. Rtishchev took effective measures against the mountaineers in parts of Dagestan, as well as in recently obtained Kartli, Kakheti, and the mountainous regions of Georgia. In 1812-1813, during the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813, he successfully managed to repulse the Iranian armies in what is now northern Armenia and southern Georgia. In August 1812, Rtishchev went from Tiflis (Tbilisi) to the Persian frontier and through the mediation of the British envoy Gore Ouseley, entered into negotiations, but the conditions proposed by the Iranian commander-in-chief Abbas Mirza were not accepted by the Russian government, and therefore Rtishchev returned to Tiflis. However, when General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky's successfully captured the Persian town of Lankaran in early 1813, it forced the Persians to accept the demeaning and highly disadvantageous conditions which Russia was requesting. On 22 October 1813 Rtishchev left Tiflis for Karabakh, where, at the village of Gulistan Russia and Iran met to sign the notorious Treaty of Gulistan which was signed two days later on 24 October 1813, with once again the mediation of Gore Ouseley. The treaty, with Rtishchev as the Russian signatory, ratified for the irrevocable cession of swaths of Iran's Caucasus territories, comprising present-day eastern Georgia, most of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and southern Dagestan to Russia. For his successful military and diplomatic efforts, Rtishchev received promotion to General of the Infantry in 1813, the same year the war with Persia ended, and received the Order of St. Alexander of Neva on 12 December 1812 and the Persian Order of the Lion and the Sun. Rtishchev resigned from his position on 21 April 1816, and was replaced by Aleksey Yermolov. In June 1817 he was appointed to the Russian senate, where he served as senator for fifteen years. He died on 20 January 1835.

The two dark, oval spots on the ephippium mark the places where the two resting eggs are located. The female was collected in a rock pool in South-Western Finland. The animal is about 2 mm long. Daphnia longispina is a planktonic crustacean of the family Daphniidae, a cladoceran freshwater water flea. It is native to Eurasia. D. longispina is similar in size and sometimes confused with the often sympatric D. pulex (a very common species), but much smaller than D. magna. D. longispina is found in a wide range of standing freshwater bodies from small, ephemeral rock-pools to large lakes. Life history Like all Daphnia species, D. longispina is a filter feeder, collecting particles of about 2 to 40 ¬µm suspended in the water. The main food are green algae. At 20 ¬∞C maturity is reached within about 6 to 12 days, followed by a period of regular reproduction in about 3-4 day intervals. D. longispina reproduces either asexually (parthenogenesis) or sexually. For the later, females need to produce sons asexually. The same or other females can switch at any moment from asexual to sexual reproduction, but producing haploid eggs, which require fertilization by males. The sexual eggs are then deposited in an ephippium (plural: ephippia, a resting egg shell), which will sink into the bottom of the water body when the female molts her carapace. After a resting period, which can last several years, the resting stages hatches. Only females emerge from the resting stages. Systematics and evolution Within the genus Daphnia, D. longispina belongs to the subgenus Hyalodaphnia, sometimes called the D. longispina complex. Closely related species of D. longispina in this complex are D. galeata and D. cucullata, with which D. longispina frequently hybridises. A revision of the species complex recently showed that the species D. rosea, D. hyalina and D. zschokkei belong to the species D. longispina, invalidating their species status. Parasitism In contrast to other Daphnia species, (e.g. D. magna) only few parasites have been reported to infect D. longispina. It is however frequently subject to colonization by epibionts, such as peritrich ciliates and algae  References =General references=   * External links Category:Cladocera Category:Freshwater crustaceans of Europe Category:Crustaceans described in 1776 Category:Taxa named by Otto Friedrich M√ºller ","title":"Daphnia longispina"},{"id":"49462735","text":"Paula L√≥pez (born ) is a Mexican female volleyball player.

Lincoln, the youngest child of Seth and Jemima (Miller) Lincoln, was born in Western, now Warren, Massachusetts, on June 20, 1799. He studied theology at Yale College and graduated in 1822. On June 16, 1824, he was ordained pastor of the Congregational church in Gardner, Massachusetts, where he remained for eighteen years, until February 23, 1842. He then supplied the Congregational church in Whately, Massachusetts, for about a year, and was next for nearly four years pastor of the Congregational church in Jamaica, Vermont. His resignation of the latter pastorate was due to the conviction that his views were no longer in harmony with the orthodox beliefs; and in the same spring (1847) he accepted a call to the pastorate of two Unitarian parishes, in Kensington and Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. Here he remained for three years, and in 1851 he accepted a call to become the pastor of the Unitarian church in Rowe, Massachusetts, where he continued for eight years. In 1860 he was settled in Warwick, Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a successful pastorate of eight years; during this time he was twice (1863 and 1866) a member of the New Hampshire State Legislature. He next went as a supply to Winchester, New Hampshire, where, after about a year, he was attacked with paralysis in the face, and was obliged to give up preaching temporarily. His health improving, he was installed in 1870 over the First Congregational (Unitarian) Church in Wilton, New Hampshire, which he served as pastor until his retirement in 1879 on the completion of his 80th year. He died in Wilton after a painful illness, of peritonitis, on August 2, 1890, in his 92nd year, being (it is believed) the oldest minister of his denomination in the country. He married, on December 30, 1822, Gratia Eliza, daughter of Dr. Nathan Smith, professor in the Medical Institution of Yale College, who died about 24 years later, leaving ten children. He next married, in 1847, Abbie Harwood, daughter of James Comee, of Gardner, Massachusetts, who survived him, with one of her two children, and six by the former marriage. The eldest son was graduated at Dartmouth College in 1850, and became an eminent physician in Washington, D.C.

He made his MLB debut in 2017. Career Scott graduated from Howland High School in 2012. He then played college baseball at Notre Dame College in 2013 and Howard College in 2014. After the 2014 season, he briefly played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham Anglers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the sixth round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. After signing, Scott made his professional debut with the Gulf Coast Orioles and spent the whole season there, going 1-5 with a 6.26 ERA in ten games (eight starts). In 2015, Scott pitched for both the Aberdeen IronBirds and Delmarva Shorebirds, where he posted a combined 4-3 record and 3.83 ERA in 42.1 innings pitched between the two clubs. After the season, he pitched in the Arizona Fall League. Scott spent 2016 with both the Frederick Keys and the Bowie Baysox, where he went 5-4 with a 4.76 ERA in 43 relief appearances between the two teams. In 2017, he played with Bowie where he compiled a 0-2 record and 2.22 ERA in 24 starts before being called up to the major leagues on September 17, 2017.http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/bs-sp-orioles-notes- scott-20170918-story.html Scott made two appearances for Baltimore for the season. = 2018 = Scott worked regular one-inning stints for the Orioles during spring season, creating speculation that the Orioles No. 6 prospect could pitch his way onto the major league roster early. The plan, however, was for Scott to pitch three-inning stints as a starter in five-man rotation for the Norfolk Tides. Orioles manager Buck Showalter says of the decision: Scott's been learning control on his fast ball, while developing his slider as an out pitch. As Schowalter notes, \\"he's not tripping that 100 [mph] or anything. It's more about control of himself as much as the baseball.\\" Of pulling back on the velocity of his \\"high-90s\\" fastball in favor of location, Scott says: After pitching out of the bullpen in Triple-A Norfolk's opening game on April 6, 2018, Scott was called up again on April 8, 2018 to join the Orioles bullpen ‚Äî just as Jimmy Yacabonis was optioned to Norfolk. Showalter said on Scott's return: Scott was optioned back to Norfolk on April 9, after pitching 1.2 innings against the Yankees the day before ‚Äî when he recorded five outs. He was recalled on April 20 prior to a Friday game against the Cleveland Indians. Infielder Engelb Vielma was optioned back to Norfolk in a corresponding move. Scott pitched two scoreless innings against the Indians the next day before being optioned once again on April 28. Baltimore recalled him on May 9. The up/down process continued on June 9th when the O's sent Scott down only to recall him on June 15th. In 53 appearances in the season, Scott worked in innings, striking out 76 in the process. = 2019 = Scott appeared in 28 games only and posted an ERA of 4.78 in innings with 37 strikeouts. = 2020 = In 2020 for the Orioles, Scott pitched to a superb 1.31 ERA to go along with 23 strikeouts in 20.2 innings pitched over 25 games.https://www.mlb.com/player/tanner-scott-656945 References External links Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Warren, Ohio Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Howard Hawks baseball players Category:Gulf Coast Orioles players Category:Aberdeen IronBirds players Category:Delmarva Shorebirds players Category:Peoria Javelinas players Category:Frederick Keys players Category:Bowie Baysox players Category:Norfolk Tides players Category:Chatham Anglers players ","title":"Tanner Scott"},{"id":"49462925","text":"The following is a list of notable deaths in January 2002.

A quarter of a century later, by now both ‚ÄúCultural Policy Research‚Äù and \\"Cultural Policy Studies\\" each match almost 100 million entries in the World Wide Web. Cultural Policy Research grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.Tony Bennett, Culture, A reformer's Science, SAGE, London, 1998 The Princeton University e.g. founded its Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies 1994 ‚Äúto improve the clarity, accuracy and sophistication of discourse about the nation's artistic and cultural life.‚Äù The scientific approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, combining social sciences, a wide range of the humanities, jurisprudence and economics. As all political sciences do, the research focuses on the content dimension (policy), the formal-institutional dimension (polity) and the practical dimension (politics), particularly affecting decision processes and the results obtained. Cultural Policy Research asks: What do the actors and agents in the Cultural Policy sphere actually do when they do what they do? Which purposes they do pursue by that? What are their goals and which means do they use? What is the result of their action for society and for the citizens‚Äô intellectual and artistic freedom? Among the many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world, there are several UNESCO Chairs in Cultural Policy from the programme launched in 1992 by the UNESCO to promote international inter-university cooperation: * (412) Vilnius, Lithuania :UNESCO Chair in Cultural Policy and Cultural Management (1998), Vilnius Academy of Arts * (436) Debrecen, Hungary: UNESCO Chair in Cultural Policy and Cultural Management (1999), Lajos Kossuth University of Arts and Sciences, Debrecen * (454) Lom√©, Togo: Chaire UNESCO sur les politiques culturelles pour le d√©veloppement (1999), Centre r√©gional d'action culturelle (CRAC) * (527) Girona, Spain / Catalunya: Chaire UNESCO en mati√®re de Politiques et de Coop√©ration Culturelles (2001), Universitat de Girona * (546) Barcelona, Spain / Catalunya: Chaire UNESCO d'√©tudes interculturelles (2001), Universit√© Pompeu Febra de Barcelone * (572) Barcelona, Spain / Catalunya: Chaire UNESCO de Diversit√© linguistique et culturelle (2002), Institut d‚ÄôEtudes catalanes * (654) Thessaloniki, Greece: Chaire UNESCO de politique interculturelle pour une citoyennet√© active et solidaire (2004), Universit√© de Mac√©doine * (827) Kazan, Russia-Tatarstan: UNESCO Chair in Eurosian studies, Cultural Diversity and Cultural Policies (2008), Kazan State University * (851) Buenos Aires, Argentine: Chaire UNESCO d‚Äôesth√©tique et sociologie de la diff√©rence et de la diversit√© culturelle en Argentine (2009), Universidad Nacional Tres de Febrero * (978) Hildesheim, Germany: UNESCO Chair in Cultural Policy for the Arts in Development (2012), The University of Hildesheim.

The roots of the problem are in gold mining; since the California Gold Rush, mercury has been used for gold extraction. Historically, 10-30% of mercury was lost in the mining process, resulting in widespread contamination of river and lake sediments. Many water bodies in the state of California bear fish consumption advisories due to mercury content.  History of California mining  Monitors (water canons) in the placer mines used to break down sediment for gold exposure. The California Gold Rush can be traced to James Marshall's January 24, 1848 discovery of gold on John Sutter's property. Marshall was building a saw mill right next to the river for Sutter, and the night before the iconic gold discovery Marshall diverted water from the American River through the lumber mill he was constructing tailrace to wash away loose gravel and dirt. The next morning (January 24, 1848) he discovered metallic flecks where the river water was flowing through the saw mill. He thought it was gold immediately, but didn't pursue it until the Sutter sawmill was completed. By the time of the following spring Marshall's gold discovery, the largest gold rush in American history began. In this short year the non-Native American population raised from 14,000 to 100,000. The population increased again to 250,000 by the year of 1892. Gold was easily extracted from the rivers, by scooping and silling the river soil and gravel. The bottom trawler method was also developed to extract more gold at once. This was the pulling of metal baskets and rakes across the river beds to stir up gold, and scoop out gravel that was rich in gold. It was later, when the gold in the river bed wasn't as plentiful, that new mining techniques were being developed to extract gold more efficiently from the ground. One of the main, and also most destructive methods was that of hydraulic mining. This involved the redirecting of water from the river into a narrow channel, into a large canvas hose, and iron nozzle. Then these water canons which were called monitors it would shoot a very high pressure stream that would break apart hillsides. The water, slurry, and debris, mostly gravel would flow over large sluices and drainage tunnels. This was also when mercury was beginning to be used to help extract the gold from the masses of ore and silt.  Use of mercury in gold mining  Historically mercury, otherwise called \\"quicksilver\\" was used during the mining process. During hydraulic mining when the water, slurry, and debris flowed over the sluices and drainage tunnels, the particles were also mixed with liquid mercury. The mercury was used during the extraction period during the mining process. The mercury was used to attract the gold and sometimes silver from the mining ore, for extraction. The most common use of mercury for the extraction was a process called mercury amalgamation. The way that this process works is that the miner mixes the element mercury with mining silt or ore, the mercury then sticks to the gold, thus separating from the ore and silt, forming one solid piece of mercury‚Äìgold amalgam. Additional separation from the silt and ore is done by washing away the ore with water until only the amalgam is left. The next step of the process is to separate the actual gold form the now useless mercury. The way this is done, is the miners heat up the mercury-gold amalgam to high temperature to vaporize the mercury away, leaving only the highly desired gold. The vaporization of mercury requires a temperature of at least 357 ¬∞C. In addition to the mercury-gold amalgam some residue mercury is also still present in the silt and ore that was washed away, sometimes referred to as mine tailings. When these mine tailings are disposed of and during the washing process, large amounts of the remaining mercury often pollutes and infiltrates the local ecosystems and especially waterways around and down steam from the mining sites. There was a loss of 10-30% of the mercury used during the extraction process, per season, which resulted in highly contaminated sediments at and down stream form mining sites. The highest mercury contamination levels are present and can be sourced back to the Placer area in California.  Environmental impacts  Mercury caused birth and developmental deformities in waterfowl. When mercury first enters into waterways and ecosystems, it is considered elemental inorganic mercury. It is not until being in the ecosystems that the elemental inorganic mercury is then converted into methylmercury by the inhabitant organisms and various forms of bacteria. These bacteria are known as anaerobic bacteria species, which convert elemental mercury into methylmercury when the bacteria methylate oxidized mercury into methylmercury. The environments that methylmercury levels are most commonly found at high levels, or future high risks are wetlands, newly flooded reservoirs, aquatic areas close to mining sites or factories, bays, and waterways with low pH levels. These factors when presented with high mercury levels, are home to the bacteria that process it. These methylmercury containing bacteria are what are then eaten by the next higher level in the food chain. Some methylmercury containing bacteria also excrete the toxin directly into the water. This newly transformed form of mercury (methylmercury) then begins to bio-accumulate in the many species inhabiting the contaminated waterways and ecosystems. Animals accumulate methylmercury in their body's faster, then it leaves their systems, resulting in each successive species in the food chain consuming higher levels of methylmercury. The bio-accumulation levels of toxic methylmercury are highest by larger predator fish species, fish eating animals, and humans which fish being a prominent food source for humans, causes much additional worry. Though methylmercury traces have also been found in reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, flora, birds, and even the surrounding soil. The many health effects of methylmercury has on wildlife include reproductive problems and reductions, enzyme and immune system problems, developmental issues, and genetic alterations. These problems have had the greatest effects on waterfowl because of their high fish diets. Some of the waterfowl experiencing the most problems with methylmercury are the Great Egret, Diving Duck, Herons, and Loons. Research and scientific surveys have shown a dramatic reduction in Loon chicks and a change in juvenile Great Egrets with a direct correlation with high levels of methylmercury. Ecosystems with both methylmercury and the element selenium can produce an even more toxic and potentially deadly mixture for wildlife.  Human health impacts  Areas in California with fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. There have been many studies and negative health impacts, directly relating to mercury contamination in both food sources and the environment. One of the main sources of mercury contamination and over consumption is through fish, already contaminated with high levels of mercury. Mercury can impair, damage, and even destroy functioning nerve tissue-much like lead. The over consumption of methylmercury can also reduce immune system response, damage the nervous system, including coordination, sense of touch, taste, and sight. One of the major health threats presented from the over consumption of these high mercury levels is the development of learning disabilities and developmental problems in children. This is the result of over mercury exposure after birth, and/or over consumption of high mercury levels of the mother during pregnancy. The high concern is because mercury can be passed between the pregnant mother through the placenta to the unborn fetus. The form that mercury that is being consumed is Methylmercury, which the federal government has classified as a neurotoxin, which is described as a poisonous substance that attacks the nervous system, and impairs the function of the nerve and nerve tissue. Even small amounts of this neurotoxin can cause brain and nervous system development problems. The effects of this utero (before birth in the uterus) transfer can also take between a number of months or even years before signs appear, making it difficult to trace back. The forms that methylmercury exposure will show itself is that the child will have shorter attention spans, poor fine motor skills, slow language development, visual-spatial abilities (like drawing), and memory. A mothers exposure and consumption of methylmercury prior to pregnancy can also be just as serious as exposure during pregnancy, because methylmercury is slowly excreted from the body, sometimes taking months to fully leave an individuals system. This can greatly effect the fetuses development, as many important developmental stages of the nervous systems and brain occur during the first two months of pregnancy. Health experts suspect that children are more susceptible to methylmercury than adults, because they eat more food relative to their total body weight causing a higher contamination percentage. It has been concluded that 60,000 children born each year are at risk for neuro-developmental effects, due to in utero exposure to methylmercury. Another form of human exposure to elemental mercury is the inhalation of the vaporized form of the element directly from its source in the environment. This form of exposure is especially common in and around old mining sites. This form of exposure can cause gingivitis, tremors, damages to the gastrointestinal tract, less efficient enzyme productivity, and in rare cases kidney failure.  Removal from water  There have been many studies on the purification and extraction of mercury from water sources and sometimes even the affected soils around the contaminated water sources. Some of these methods that are continuously being researched and sampled are the use of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Because the different forms of mercury have different forms of toxicity, this method allows for the removal of each form and a thorough study of the toxicity and potential harm of each separate form. This is because the typical concentration of methylmercury in water sources and ethylmercury is below detection rates, but it doesn't necessarily mean the continuous buildup in the consumers body's, or the environment will have any symptoms. The most common method of speciation for the removal, is gas chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography paired with fluorescence, natural elements, and photometry detectors. The downside of this form of detection is that it requires very large numbers of samples to test the concentration and toxicity levels. Other methods include the charging of ions to separate the toxic elements and toxins from the water for extraction. These methods are currently most common for use in China, for the removal of these toxic heavy metals for the use of drinking water. One theory that is being tested by the federal government to clean methylmercury out of waterways, is to find a bacterium that transforms methylmercury back into elemental mercury. With this process of transformation, the elemental mercury can vaporize and evaporate out of the waterways naturally.

They represent clich√©s or feminine types \\"that are deeply embedded in the cultural imagination.\\" Details Cindy Sherman poses in various stereotypical female roles inspired by 1950's and 1960's Hollywood, Film noir, B movies, and European art-house films. They represent clich√©s or feminine types (the office girl, bombshell, girl on the run, housewife, and so on) \\"that are deeply embedded in the cultural imagination.\\" The characters in all of these photographs are always looking away from the camera and outside of the frame. Sherman casts herself in each of these roles, becoming both the artist and subject in the work. The art historian Rosalind Krauss described the series as ‚Äúcopies without originals‚Äù. All of the images are untitled, as Sherman wanted to preserve their ambiguity. The numbers affiliated with individual works of art are assigned by her gallery, mainly as a cataloguing system. In December 1995, the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) acquired all sixty-nine black-and-white photographs in the series. Sherman later decided to add one more image, bringing the series to seventy. In past exhibitions at MOMA, the photographs are neither hung chronologically, nor grouped according to theme, locale, or content. Modest in scale compared to Sherman's later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8¬Ω √ó 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames. The glossy finish and scale are meant to reference publicity or promotion stills for a movie.

It is the church-school congregation in which Saint Varnava, the first American-born Serbian to be proclaimed an Orthodox saint, was baptized, served as altar boy, and was first recognized as a youthful prodigy in reciting Serbian folklore and old ballads. It is recognized as being among \\"10 Beautiful Region Cathedrals and Churches\\" in Northwest Indiana and one of the Midwest's oldest parishes, founded by early Serbian settlers in the United States seeking to establish their local community with the building of a church to help maintain their traditional customs. Through its religious and nationalistic endeavors, it earned the renowned name of \\"Srpska Gera\\". It is now among the churches in the Northwest Indiana region that enjoy the status of institutional landmarks.  Architectural design and recognition  = Design model = The architectural design of the exterior central portion of the current St. Sava church building was modeled in the Byzantine architecture style after the Oplenac, a Serbian Orthodox Church located in Topola, Serbia. The central part of the church structure shares many similarities in its physical features and likeness to the Oplenac. = Gold Medal Award = Upon completion of construction of the main structure in 1990, the Illinois Indiana Masonry Council honored St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church with the Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Masonry Design citing the work of Architect Radovan Pejovic and Mason Contractor Gacesa Masonry Construction. = Physical attributes = The nave, or center of the church, is with a center cupola rising more than high. The church can accommodate as many as 500 people. The steel beams that form the skeleton of the building structure enable the expansive central part of the church to exist open and barrier free. The steel beams were made in two Lake County, Indiana, steel plants, Inland Steel and U.S. Steel. The north wing of the building complex holds administrative offices, a custodian‚Äôs apartment, and originally a library which was intended at the time of the church consecration and has since been converted into a museum organized by the St. Sava Historical Society. The lower level of the north wing houses the Sunday School classrooms. The south wing was originally designed to house classrooms with movable partitions when the church was built, but has since been converted into a small hall with built-in kitchen and bar facilities available for rental known as the South Wing Social Center. The exterior facade of the building is Indiana limestone from Bedford, Indiana, and the interior of the church is mainly constructed from Appalachian red wood. The giant chandelier in the center of the church and several others are of German crystal designed and custom-made in a New York plant. The largest is across and tall and weighs . = Interior iconography = All the original iconography lining the walls are the work of Orthodox priest Theodore Jurewicz. Jurewicz painted the Virgin Mary and the Christ child over the center altar in 1991 over a period of two months. Jurewicz later returned and painted ‚ÄúThe Nativity of Christ‚Äù icon on the north wall, taking two weeks to compete it in March 1993. Later that year, Jurewicz painted ‚ÄúThe Resurrection of Christ and Descent into Hades‚Äù icon on the south wall, taking two weeks to complete it in May 1993. Jurewicz also painted the icon mural in the choir loft of twelve saints that are important to the Orthodox faith, intertwined with a history rich with religious and political significance. The choir loft mural was painted by Jurewicz in November 1993. The icon depicting ‚Äúrighteous souls going into paradise - cursed souls on their way to hell‚Äù was painted in the church vestibule by Jurewicz and his two sons in August 1999. = Exterior mosaic iconography = There are 36 mosaics, 34 of them completely visible from the exterior and 2 of them visible on the north and south entrances of the main church visible from within the atrium enclosures. These religious mosaics are deemed to be iconographic in nature even though the techniques and materials used by the artist differ from the painted icon. All the mosaics were created by Marchione Studios of Canton, Ohio. Over the main entrance is an icon of Christ as the Head of the Church, and an icon of Saint Sava, the Patron Saint of the Church. Above the south door of the church, in the atrium, is the icon of Saint Simeon, Saint Sava's father. In the atrium, over the north door, is Saint Lazar, the sainted hero of Kosovo. Above the doors that link the church to the two wings, on the west side, are icons of two courageous warriors of Christ, who guard the north and south entrances. Over the north atrium door is the mosaic of the Great Martyr Saint Demetrius. Mosaics on the east side atrium doors depict the two representatives of the heavenly body with Saint Archangel Michael to the north and the Angel of Resurrection from the Monastery Mileseva to the south. At the west end of the north wing exterior is the American crest depicting an eagle and the seal of the United States of America, with the inscription, \\"God Bless America.\\" On the exterior of the south wing's west wall is the Serbian crest with the inscription \\"God saves Serbs.\\" These crests reflect the congregation's faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Orthodox Church, and in the national heritage. The remainder of the mosaics on both wings depict the following monasteries, churches, and individuals:  South wing mosaics (west side)  * Studenica Monastery * Hilandar Monastery * Zica Monastery * Oplenac Monastery * King Peter I  South wing mosaics (east aide)  * Patriarchate of Pec Monastery * Saint Naum of Ohrid Monastery * Saint Sava Monastery (Libertyville, Illinois) ‚Äì This mosaic depicts Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery in the United States, the first monastery on the North American Continent. It was built in 1931 by Mardarije Uskokovich, the first bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese. The exterior is in the Russian style and the interior in the Serbian-Byzantine. It considered by many to be the most important religious, educational and national center for the entire American- Serbian population. It played a special role in bringing and situating Serbian immigrants in the post-World War II years. It serves as a Diocesan seat. * Saint Sava Church (Gary, 1939) ‚Äì This mosaic depicts the church that would stand at the corner of 13th and Connecticut in Gary, Indiana, a new church center necessitated by the fast growth of the membership. Bishop Mardarije Uskokovich blessed the ground in 1929. The cornerstone was blessed by Bishop Iriney Djordjevich, administrator of the Diocese, in 1937. Bishop Damaskin Gradanicki served the rite of consecration in 1938. The Godfather of the event, Nikola Tesla, was represented by Michael Duchich. The church was completed in 1939. Construction was undertaken during the worst times of the Great Depression, yet the mortgage was paid by 1944. The congregation gave up nine of its sons to World War II, and two more in the Korean War. The parish was vigorously engaged in bringing immigrants to Gary during the post-war years. This church was destroyed by fire in February 1978. * Saint Sava Church (Gary, 1915) ‚Äì This mosaic depicts the church that Serbians in Gary founded after first Serbian School at 14th and Massachusetts Streets began in 1912. The first teacher was Mr. Paul Veljkov, who later became a priest. The church- school congregation was organized in 1914, and by 1915 the congregation built and consecrated their new building at the corner of 20th and Connecticut Streets in Gary, Indiana. Godfather for its dedication was Michael Pupin, who donated $300 and was represented by Mr. John Matanovich. Through the leadership of Father Peter Stijachich and executive board president John Marich the mortgage was liquidated quickly. This property was sold in 1939 after a new church on 13th Avenue was completed. Among its parishioners were 450 volunteers who were recruited during World War I to fight with the Allies in Serbia. Serbia's highest award for heroism was given to Jovo Sever and Risto Vajagich, with Vajagich leading the nine Vajagich brothers in action.  South wing mosaics (south side)  * Draza Mihailovich * Maiden of Kosovo * Karageorge  North wing mosaics (west side)  * Mileseva Monastery * Gracanica Monastery * Decani Monastery * New Gracanica Monastery * King Alexander I  North wing mosaics (east side)  * Cetinje Monastery * Krka Monastery * Gomirje Monastery * Tvrdos Monastery * Krusedol Monastery  North wing mosaics (north side)  * Michael Pupin * Jovan Ducic * Nikola Tesla  History  = Early years (1912-1920) = The Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church-School Congregation began with a large population of Serbian people who settled in the Gary, Indiana area and served an important role in maintaining the Serbian culture while also helping Serbian immigrants adapt to mainstream America. In 1912, before any official church congregation was established, a group of Serbians in Gary founded the first Serbian School at 14th and Massachusetts Streets. The first teacher of the school was Paul Veljkov, who later became a priest and would be the second priest to serve the St. Sava Church-School Congregation after it officially formed in 1914. The Serbian Orthodox Church-School Congregation of St. Sava was established February 15, 1914, in Gary and adopted and ratified the first by-laws of the church on March 22, 1914, at the Main Membership Assembly for efficient and successful realization of its aims and purposes. The Serbian Orthodox Church- School Congregation of St. Sava was founded as a community of persons who profess the Orthodox Faith and reside in one ore more localities which comprise a geographical or administrative unit. For legal purposes, the St. Sava Church-School Congregation was originally incorporated on April 16, 1914. The first church building was founded and consecrated on June 13, 1915, at 20th and Connecticut streets in Gary. The mortgage for that building was retired in 1916.  1920s  At the beginning of the 1920s, internal provincial divisiveness within the congregation was so great that it led to a division. Even the Circle of Serbian Sisters, an auxiliary organization of the church, split. A second parish, known as Holy Resurrection, was founded at 39th and Washington Streets in the Glen Park section of Gary. Because living conditions changed, the membership of the St. Sava Church-School congregation amended its by-laws at an annual meeting on March 7, 1927. In 1929, Bishop Mardarije Uskokovich from the Saint Sava Monastery in Libertyville, Illinois, blessed the ground where the new St. Sava Church would be built at the corner of 13th and Connecticut Streets in Gary.  1930s  Following a unification of the split that occurred within the congregation in the early 1920s, the parish built \\"one of the most Serbian of Churches and centers on this continent\\" in the late 1930s due to the need for a larger facility that was more centrally located. In 1937, the cornerstone for the new church was blessed by Bishop Iriney Djordjevich, administrator of the American-Canadian Diocese at the time. Bishop Damaskin Gradanicki served the rite of consecration for the newly completed church building November 24, 1938. With construction and consecration complete, the congregation moved north from its original church building to Its new, second location at 1300 Connecticut Street at the corner of 13th and Connecticut Streets in Gary.  1940s  The church mortgage for the new building was retired in 1943.  1950s  In 1955, the St. Sava Church-School Congregation purchased on 49th Avenue in Hobart, Indiana, where it would ultimately build a picnic grounds and a large hall facility that would serve the congregation for decades. In 1956 the debt for the picnic grounds was retired and the facility was officially blessed. The St. Sava Church-School Congregation again amended its by-laws on December 23, 1956, this time at an Extraordinary Membership Meeting. When the State of Indiana changed its laws for church and religious organizations on March 3, 1943, the St. Sava Church-School Congregation was reincorporated June 14, 1957. By the end of the 1950s the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church-School Congregation was recognized as the largest Eastern Orthodox Church in Gary,.  1960s  In the beginning of the 1960s, a portion of the membership separated itself from the congregation at St. Sava and formed the Macedonian Orthodox Church and a religious and cultural center was established in Crown Point, Indiana. In 1963, a schism at the highest levels of the Serbian Orthodox Church resulted in the defrocking of Bishop Dionisije and a division among the Serbian Orthodox faithful in diaspora. What followed was a bitter conflict with attendant lawsuits in civil courts for nearly three decades. Locally, this schism also resulted in a portion of the membership separating from the St. Sava Church-School Congregation and forming the new Church-School Congregation of St. Elijah, which established a church and cultural center in Crown Point, Indiana. In 1960 Dusan Bunjevic was appointed Superintendent of the Sunday School and the Serbian School of the parish. Later, on July 4, 1964, Bunjevic was ordained a deacon in Jackson, California, and then on August 9, 1964, he was ordained a priest at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church. Also in the early 1960s, the parish priest of St. Sava Church, Hieromonk Petar Bankerovic, later Bishop of Australia-New Zealand, was attacked and viciously beaten outside the church, which left him with physical impairments for the rest of his life. Gary Mayor A. Martin Katz proclaimed Sunday, November 15, 1964, as \\"St. Sava Serbian Church Day\\" in Gary in honor of the Easter Orthodox church's 50th anniversary of its founding in the City of Gary. The Church hosted a banquet program that featured Col. Nick T. Stepanovich, counsel for Free Eastern Orthodox Diocese of America and Canada. In 1969, the newly constructed hall was officially dedicated.  1970s  In 1970, the mortgage for the hall on 49th Avenue in Hobart was retired. In 1971, the State of Indiana changed its laws for church and religious organizations once again, necessitating the St. Sava Church-School Congregation to be reincorporated on February 27, 1974. Also in 1971, the Church-School Congregation purchased a parish home at the corner of 53rd and Carolina Street in Merrillville, Indiana. The second building of the congregation, dedicated in 1939, was destroyed by a fire in the late afternoon and early evening of February 16, 1978. The entire church complex including each church item, a large library, an administrative office, a social hall, caretakers quarters, the Parish Priest Home and furnishing were all lost, with the exception of the Holy Relics. Without any lapse in the Church‚Äôs liturgical services, worship resumed the following Sunday after the fire, February 19, 1978, when Bishop Iriney brought new Antimins (a Corporal - a silk cloth portraying the Body of Jesus Christ being placed into the Tomb) and gave His blessing so that the Divine Liturgy could be celebrated on an ordinary table covered with a plain cloth in the Saint Sava Serbian Hall on 49th Avenue in Hobart. In the weeks following the fire, the small hall at the facilities in Hobart was completely converted into a chapel in less than 45 days under the supervision of Peter Erkman and Dragan Adamovich during the presidency of Zivojin Cokic of the church Executive Board. The small chapel would continue to be the spiritual center for the church until the consecration of the new church building in 1991 in Merrillville, Indiana. During the excavation of the ruins of the church in Gary, Indiana, three youths, Louis Milicich, Steven Baroevich, and John Derado found the remains of the Holy Corporal in which the Holy Relics, which had been sewn into the Holy Corporal by the Bishop, were found intact. Also at the excavation, Radmila Milivojevich, president and member of the Circle of Serbian Sisters at St. Sava, found the undamaged metal box which contained the Holy Relics placed in the Holy Table by the Bishop at the consecration of the church in 1938. At the Annual Membership Meeting February 26, 1978, the Congregation resolved, \\"...to find a suitable construction site, inquire about the price, review the environment, and learn all details pertinent to building a new church.\\" Upon the recommendation of the Executive Board, the Extraordinary Membership Assembly voted on April 8, 1978 \\"...to purchase 140 acres of land on 9191 Mississippi Street in Merrillville, Indiana at $6,000 per acre for a total of $833,712 with an 8% annual interest on the loan. President Zivojin Cokic and the Executive Board signed the contract with Guaranteed Life Insurance Company and placed a deposit on June 9, 1978. Stevan and Zagorka Micic voluntarily guaranteed the terms of the contract using their personal collateral.  1980s  With President Cokic and the Executive Board, along with the work of Finance Chairman Nicholas Chabraja and all subordinate organizations and personnel, the loan for the property was liquidated in 19 months. On the Slava Day of St. Sava Sunday, January 27, 1980, the mortgage on the loan was burned so that the 1 of land at 9191 Mississippi Street in Merrillville became the absolute property of the St. Sava Church-School Congregation. In 1982, the membership of the St. Sava Church-School Congregation approved a building program at the Mississippi Street properly. Due to an increase in membership and the number of duties including successful progress and added administrative needs in the Church- School Congregation, the Extraordinary Membership Assembly accepted and affirmed new by-laws on May 16, 1982. Members of the 1982 By-laws Committee were Steve Boljanich, Chairman; Very Rev. Fr. Jovan Todorovich, Secretary; Nick Chabraja, Member (Past President); Nick Sever, Member (Past President); Zivojin Cokic, Member (Past President). The president of the Executive Board of the church at the time was Joe Sever and the secretary of the Executive Board was Alexander Churchich The by-laws for the St. Sava Church-School Congregation were approved by Bishop Irinej at The Most Holy Mother of God Monastery in Third Lake, Illinois, on January 31, 1983.Those by-lays are still in use as of 2016. On Sunday, June 5, 1983, the Executive Board of St. Sava chose the precise spot for the construction site on 9191 Mississippi Street and the Diocesan Bishop Rt. Rev. Iriney was invited to bless the ground and place a wooden Cross. The contract for Milojko Perisich, the first architect named to the new building project, was approved September 13, 1983. However, architect Perisich died December 28, 1983 requiring the search for a new architect to complete the project. Radovan Pejovic, the architect who would complete the building project for the new church, was approved May 7, 1984. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new church was held on July 31, 1985. The foundation of the new church was consecrated in 1987. The bells of the church were consecrated and installed in 1988, and the five crosses at the tops of the domes of St. Sava Church were consecrated and installed in 1989.  1990s  The chapel in the Saint Sava Serbian Hall in Hobart served as the primary location of liturgical services from the time of the fire until the consecration of the new church building on May 18, 1991 in Merrillville. The Kumovi of the Church at the Consecration Ceremony were Glisho Rapaich, Mike and Yvonne Galich. Serbian Patriarch Pavle served Divine Pontifical Liturgy at St. Sava Church in Merrillville, Indiana. In 1999 St. Sava's new \\"Spomenik\\" Monument was placed near the south end of the South Wing of the main Church Building. The monument honors all wars since 1389 Kosovo and was donated by Mile and Ella Kosanovich.  2000s  The St. Sava Church-School Congregation celebrated its 90th anniversary on November 14, 2004. In 2005, Bishop Varnava was canonized as Saint Varnava (Barnabas). He had been the first altar boy at St. Sava Church when it was located in Gary. In 2007, the St. Sava Serbian Historical Society was established to preserve ethnic culture and history. Also in February 2007, the Very Reverend Stavrophor Jovan Todorovich retired as priest and Father Marko Matic began serving the congregation. In 2009, the old Veteran‚Äôs Monument from former site of St. Sava Church in Gary was moved to the church grounds in Merrillville by the Sever family and volunteers.  2010s  St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church honored St. Varnava during a service on November 11, 2010. at the church. Rev. Thomas Kazich, with the Serbian Midwest Diocese of North America, and the Rev. Marko Matic, a priest at St. Sava Church, were involved in the service. The St. Sava Church-School Congregation launched its first social media presence with an official Facebook Page and their first posting October 25, 2011. In April 2014, representatives from the St. Sava Church-School Congregation presented preliminary plans to the Town of Merrillville Board of Zoning Appeals for the construction of a cemetery. The Special Exemption approval was granted by the Town of Merrillville Board of Zoning Appeals in April 2014 and later approved at the Town Council meeting in May 2014. In November 2014 the St. Sava Church-School Congregation celebrated the 100th anniversary of the church. The festivities included a full weekend of events which took place in the newly completed Pavilion, a contemporary venue that serves as a central meeting place for the congregation to host large-scale cultural events, and is also available for rental to the general public for weddings, business conferences, tradeshows, and other local events requiring a large-scale venue space. Crown Prince Alexander and Crown Princess Katherine of Serbia made their first visit to St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church on September 30, 2016. They participated in a prayer in the church, toured an exhibit created by the St. Sava Church Historical Society, viewed a performance by the St. Sava Church Children's Choir, and then attended a special humanitarian fundraising banquet taking place in the event center at St. Sava Church. On November 12, 2016, Bishop Longin, along with visiting clergy, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Orthodox Cemetery at St. Sava Church. Earth-moving equipment was on-site and construction officially began in the weeks following the ceremony. November 12, 2016, was also a date that saw two other significant events, in the history of the church. In the weeks leading up to this date, a major floor refinishing project took place in the main church where all of the wood floors throughout the church were refinished and carpet in the altar replaced. The replacement of the carpeting in the Altar required moving of all the items in the altar, including the Holy Relics on the Holy Table which was the first time such items were moved since the consecration of the church 25 years earlier. Bishop Longin blessed the Church, enabling services to resume in the sacred space. Bishop Longin also elevated Father Marko Matic to the rank of Stavrophor in the Orthodox Church on November 12, 2016. This is the highest rank for an Orthodox priest serving a parish.  2020s  In response to the government of Montenegro seeking to confiscate Serbian Orthodox Church lands, Holy Sites and Holy Relics, all Serbian Churches in Northwest Indiana joined in a peaceful demonstration or Litija, and a special service (Moleban) in a show of support for their brothers and sisters in Montenegro, protecting theirHoly Sites. Bishops Longin and Bishop Metodije from Montenegro, with local clergy, led those in attendance in prayer and a 4-mile solemn walk of protest from St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church to St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in Merrillville. = Present day = The present church was built on at 9191 Mississippi Street in Merrillville on land purchased by the Church-School Congregation following the fire of the church at 13th and Connecticut Streets in Gary. During the interim years of 1978 through 1991, while the Liturgy was still being performed in the Chapel, the priest and the church board undertook plans to finance and erect what would be a \\"once-in-a-lifetime endeavor\\" constructing the \\"church of our dreams\\", which was consecrated in 1991 and home to the Church-School Congregation as of present day. In November 2014 the church was able to complete construction of the new Pavilion in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the church. The Pavilion complex with its main assembly area, stage, kitchen, bar, and storage areas compose more than overall, with the central open floor space taking up nearly of the building and allowing for a wide variety of physical layouts for many types of large-scale events. One of the most striking features of the Pavilion is the unique use of full-length, floor-to-ceiling accordion-style window/doors which line the length of the main exterior walls of the large central assembly area, offering seamless transition from the comfort of the central hall to the beauty of the outside environment. These unique accordion window/doors provide access to the two large patio areas that exist for additional outdoor event space usage which face scenic wooded areas towards the back side of the pavilion facility. The state-of-the-art, contemporary venue is available for rental to the general public for weddings, business conferences, tradeshows, and other local events requiring a large-scale venue space, but it also serves as a critical central meeting place for the congregation to host large-scale cultural events such as the annual \\"Serb Fest\\" which takes place each summer and other special events throughout the year like the Lenten Fish Frys, the youth folklore group's annual Intercultural Dance Festival, or the Children's Choir Festival hosting youth choral talent from around the midwest.  Official languages  The official languages of the Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church-School Congregation are Serbian (Cyrillic Alphabet) and English; and the Liturgical languages are Church-Slavonic, Serbian, and English.  Aim of the congregation  The purposes of the Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church-School Congregation are, according to its by-laws: # to protect, preserve and perpetuate the true teaching of the Orthodox Faith, together with all Serbian traditions and customs; # to accept persons into the Holy Orthodox Faith through Holy Baptism and to guide them into family life through marriage according to the teachings and traditions of the Church; # to, through appropriate teaching, edify the believers towards spiritual and moral perfection, to foster mutual brotherly love and unity, and to mold worthy and loyal citizens of these United States of America, # to erect and maintain a church and all appurtenant annexes pertinent to the spiritual, cultural, educational, national, athletic and social needs of its faithful; # to establish and maintain Church and Serbian Schools and to help organize programs for the spiritual and moral upbringing of the children and youth; # to preach and practice charity as a high ideal of our Christian religion; # to preserve our ancestral tradition of interring members of our church who depart this life; # to cooperate and maintain good relations with other church-school congregations within our Diocese of New Gracanica and Midwestern America  Priests  The following have served as priests at St. Sava Church since its founding.

Born with the secular name Vojislav Nastic in Gary, Indiana, in 1914, he lived with his family in a home near 12th Avenue and Madison Street and was the first person baptized at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church when it was located in Gary, where he also served as an altar boy. A play was written and produced in January 1965 at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church about Bishop Varnava, \\"Martyr to Communism,\\" and was acted in the church auditorium by children to acquaint them with his life and death. The author of the play was Daisy Wuletich, Gary-born, who had visited Bishop Varnava when he was living in Serbia, drew upon her personal letters of the Bishop, from an account of the trial, and her personal observations. Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church maintained connection with Varnava throughout his life. More than 40 years before Varnava was canonized as a Saint, St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church sought his release from the Tito regime which had imprisoned Varnava in 1948 for preaching against the Communist way of life in Yugoslavia. It was hoped that Varnava would be released and able to return to the United States for the 50th anniversary of the Church in 1964. However, his release was not granted and he was not able to attend.  Orthodox cemetery  In April 2014, representatives from the St. Sava Church-School Congregation presented preliminary plans to the Town of Merrillville Board of Zoning Appeals for the construction of a Cemetery. The Special Exemption approval was granted by the Town of Merrillville Board of Zoning Appeals in April 2014 and later approved at the Town Council meeting in May 2014. In January 2016, the Executive Board of the St. Sava Church-School Congregation voted to approve members of the Cemetery Board. The board will help to guide the Rules and Regulations of the new Cemetery and provide certain types of guidance and support as preparations for construction begin to take shape in 2016. On November 12, 2016 Bishop Login, along with visiting clergy, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Orthodox Cemetery at St. Sava Church. Earth moving equipment was on-site and construction officially began in the weeks following the ceremony. At the time of the groundbreaking it was estimated that the initial construction efforts to prepare the land would be completed in Spring 2017.  Historical Society and Museum  The church maintains a museum in the north wing of the church building complex that is organized by the Historical Society of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church and is open to the public during special events and by appointment. The society has featured exhibits through the years highlighting Serbs in the Steel Mills, Serbian Weddings, Serbian Sisters Circle, Serbs in Sports, Serbs in the Military, and other traveling exhibits. Members of the Historical Society also help maintain a special section of the museum dedicated to the Karageorge Choir of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, which is located in the choir loft in the central part of the church.

His parents, Peter Christian and Hannah (Olivarius) Lutkin, emigrated to the U.S. from Denmark in 1844. He attended Chicago public schools and was a chorister and organist at St. Peter and St. Paul's Episcopal Church. At age thirteen he began formal music training, studying organ with Clarence Eddy, piano with Regina Watson, and theory with Frederick Grant Gleason. At age twenty-one, he became a piano instructor in the Conservatory of Music at Northwestern University. In 1881 he traveled to Berlin to study with Oscar Ralf (1881‚Äì1964) (sv), rl August Haupt (1810‚Äì1891), and Woldemar Bargiel (1828‚Äì1897). After a year he was admitted to the Royal School of Art in Berlin. He returned to Chicago to serve as organist and choirmaster, first at St. Clement's Protestant Episcopal Church and later at St. James Episcopal Church. He also served a three-year appointment on the faculty of the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago. He was a widely respected organist and helped found the American Guild of Organists in 1896. He married, on October 27, 1885, Nancy Lelah Carmen (1861‚Äì1949). In 1891, he returned to Northwestern University, where he contributed to significant improvements in the Conservatory of Music. In 1892, the Conservatory became a department in the College of Liberal Arts. In 1895, a separate School of Music was formed and Lutkin was appointed its first dean. He remained in that position until he was named Dean Emeritus in 1928. While at Northwestern, he founded the Women's Cecilian Choir, the Men's Glee Club, and the A Cappella Choir (1906), the first a cappella choir in the U.S. The group was organized to illustrate a university lecture on the music of Renaissance composers. Shortly thereafter, F. Melius Christiansen established the St. Olaf Choir (1912), and John Finley Williamson organized the Westminster Choir (1920). By the middle of the 1930s, a cappella choirs had become a staple in choral programs in high schools, colleges, and universities across the U.S. Lutkin's Northwestern A Cappella Choir was widely recognized for its pure tone and exceptional balance‚Äîa result achieved by using no accompaniment, even during rehearsals. Lutkin became a national spokesperson for a cappella singing. He appeared on programs of the Music Teachers National Association in 1909 (when his choir performed), 1916, 1917, 1923 and 1928. He directed the Music Supervisors Chorus of five hundred voices at their national convention in 1920, and the Northwestern University Choir sang for the Music Supervisors Convention in Chicago in 1928. In most of these appearances, he focused on the merits of unaccompanied singing and a cappella choral repertoire. In 1918, the honor society Pi Kappa Lambda (Œ†ŒöŒõ) was established at Northwestern University, and the Greek letters chosen were based on Lutkin's name. As a composer, Lutkin specialized in writing unaccompanied choral music, primarily for his own choir. He wrote at least thirty hymn tunes, numerous songs for children, and sixty-five choral anthems, some of which remain in print today. He co-edited a Methodist hymnal and was musical editor of the Methodist Sunday-School Hymnal. Generations of choristers likely were first introduced to his choral music through his benediction setting, The Lord Bless You and Keep You, with its famous concluding sevenfold amen. In addition to his position as Dean and Director of Choirs at Northwestern University, he also served as Professor of Theory, Piano, Organ, and Composition in the School of Music, 1895-1931; Director of the School's Department of Church and Choral Music, 1926‚Äì28; and Lecturer in Church Music at Seabury-Western Theological Seminary. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in music from Syracuse University. He wrote several books including a history of the Northwestern School of Music. Lutkin died on December 27, 1931, in Evanston, Illinois, after suffering a heart attack.

Individual animals with this ability are often seen in the American Saddlebred horse breed, though the Icelandic horse also has five-gaited individuals, though with a different set of gaits than the Saddlebred. The ability to perform an ambling gait or to pace appears to be due to a specific genetic mutation. Some horses are able to both trot and perform an ambling gait, but many can only do one or the other, thus five-gaited ability is not particularly common in the horse world. In the American Saddlebred and related breeds, the five gaits performed are the walk, trot, canter, and two ambling gaits: the rack, a fast, lateral, four-beat gait that is synchronous‚Äî \\"each foot meets the ground at equal, separate intervals\\"; and a \\"slow gait\\", a slower, smooth collected four-beat gait that is asynchronous ‚Äî \\"the lateral front and hind feet start almost together but the hind foot contacts the ground slightly before its lateral forefoot.\\" Another name for the slow gait is the stepping pace. The USEF is clear that the slow gait is not merely a slow version of the rack, but the primary difference between the two is the slight hesitation between the second and third beats of the slow gait. A five-gaited horse might also perform the fox trot rather than the stepping pace. The flying pace In the Icelandic horse, the five gaits are the walk, trot, canter, t√∂lt and the skei√∞, or flying pace. The t√∂lt is a lateral four-beat gait compared to the rack of the Saddlebred, but in style of performance sometimes more closely resembles the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern is the same as the walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to t√∂lt, while others prefer to trot. The flying pace is a two- beat lateral gait, with a moment of suspension between the two sets of footfalls At racing speeds, horses can perform the flying pace at speeds close to 30 mph. Icelandics that can perform the t√∂lt but not the flying pace are called \\"four-gaited.\\" Other gaited horse breeds may be able to perform five gaits, and individual horses of breeds not normally noted for possessing ambling gaits may also do so. Examples of these include the part-Saddlebred National Show Horse, the Arabian horse, the Morgan, and the Morab.

Later in his career, he was the principal of that school.  Biography  Lajos Petrik was born in Sopron, Hungary as the second child of J√≥zsef Petrik and Amalia Krueg. After he had completed his secondary education in Sopron and Pozsony, he studied at the University of Technology in Graz. There he got a job as a teacher of the fundamentals of chemical technology between 1874 and 1879. In 1880 he was asked by √Ågoston Trefort, Minister of Religion and Public Education, to teach in the recently established Public Secondary Industrial School of Budapest. From 1907 to 1914, he was the director of the institution. He started doing research about the compounds of ceramics and minerals usable in different industries. His scientific articles were published in the journals of the Hungarian Geological Society as well as in other domestical and foreign trade magazines (e.g. Zentralblatt). He also wrote notes for the two biggest Hungarian encyclopedias (Pallas's Great Lexicon and R√©vai's Great Lexicon) on the subject of minerals, inorganic chemical compounds and the history of ceramics. In 1891 he became a member of the Association of Hungarian Tourists (Hungarian: Magyar Turista Egyes√ºlet, MTE) that published a famous monthly printed newspaper called the Journal of Tourists (Hungarian: Turist√°k Lapja). Until 1910 he was an editor of the journal. During this period he climbed many of the peaks in the Pannonian Basin. He was an active climber in the Southern Carpathians, in the Alps and also in the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains. He usually wrote notes about the trips which were also published along with his amateur panoramic photos. He died on 7 June 1932 in Budapest. His grave can be found in the Kerepesi Cemetery (Budapest).  Professional works  In addition to his general knowledge of chemistry, Petrik specialized in the field of silicate chemistry. In this field, he conducted experiments and published articles. Many scientists throughout Europe visited him to seek out his expertise. The German newspaper Zentralblatt published his articles during his lifetime. Owing to Petrik's reputation, Hungarian delegations were always welcomed guests in different professional exhibitions (e.g. World Exhibition). His first article was written with the co-operation of geologist J√°nos Jakab Mattyasovszky. The title of this work is: The detailed catalog of Hungarian raw materials for the industry of materials, glasses, cement and mineral paints. It was published in 1885. In this book they described the properties of samples (minerals) coming from 176 different places in Hungary.

The Communist assault took Skyline Ridge overlooking the vital Royalist base of Long Tieng and forced restationing of Royalist aviation assets and civilian refugees. However, Communist forces eventually receded back onto their lines of communication without capturing the base. Campaign Z was notable for escalations of the Laotian Civil War conflict. The Vietnamese Communists brought 130 mm field guns and T-34 tanks into action in Laos for the first time. The Vietnamese People's Air Force also launched MiG 21 attacks into Lao air space to challenge the Royalist side's air supremacy. On its side, the Royal Lao Government and its Central Intelligence Agency backers imported copious numbers of mercenaries from the Kingdom of Thailand as reinforcements, and depended on American air power support, including Arc Light strikes by B-52 Stratofortresses. An independent Laos would narrowly survive Campaign Z. Overview The Kingdom of Laos was established as a neutral independent constitutional monarchy by the 1954 Geneva Agreement. In 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos reaffirmed the principle that no foreign military personnel could be stationed in Laos except for a French training mission. Despite that international proviso, troops of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) had occupied Houaphanh Province as early as 1953 while the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) denied their presence. In turn, as part of the American assumption of total support of the Royal Lao Government, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) covertly raised a Hmong guerrilla army under General Vang Pao around the Plain of Jars in Military Region 2 (MR 2).Dommen, pp. 33-60.Castle, pp. 57-59, 79-81. Background Xiangkhoang Province, Laos contains the Plain of Jars where Campaign Z was waged. While the war on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the southern Laotian panhandle was considered an extension of the Vietnam War, the war in northern Laos was the heart of the Laotian Civil War. It was a seesaw war. In November 1968, Vang Pao and his guerrillas had waged Operation Pigfat and been rather successful with Operation Raindance. The PAVN short sharp riposte of Campaign Toan Thang during 18-27 June 1969 redressed the balance by capturing the strategic forward air base at Muang Soui. From 1-15 July, the Royalists hastily struck back with Operation Off Balance. That was followed up by Kou Kiet, also called Operation About Face, which in August and September 1970 recaptured the Plain of Jars from the Communists at the cost of excessive Hmong casualties.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 201-217. Stepping on the tail of Kou Kiet, the Communist combined arms offensive of Campaign 139 was a gross escalation of the war, waged from September 1969 through April 1970. At its end, the Vietnamese Communists had conquered the Plain and besieged the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng, nearly winning the war. The aptly named Operation Counterpunch by the Royalists, fought during Autumn 1970, succeeded in buying the Hmong some time.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 248-267. In turn, Campaign 74B was a Communist combined arms offensive during Spring 1971 that once again besieged Long Tieng.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 294-300. Preliminary activities As the forces of Campaign 74B receded back upon their lines of communication during summer 1971, opening a 20 kilometer gap between the armies, L'arm√©e Clandestine advanced onto the Plain of Jars and occupied about half of it. Anticipating further attacks by the PAVN, the Royalists set up half a dozen fire support heavy weapons bases networking the Plain with mutually supporting fans of artillery fire. Their CIA supporters arranged for reinforcement by Thai mercenary battalions from Operation Unity, as little manpower was available from other military regions. The Royalists were fielding approximately 5,000 troops in 19 battalions. Five of these were Hmong; four were Lao regular army battalions. The remaining ten battalions were Thai mercenaries.Anthony, Sexton, p. 351.Ahern, p. 435.Conboy, Morrison, p. 303. Meantime, the PAVN moved T-34 tanks and 16 130mm field guns from North Vietnam into Laos to support future offensives. Although a smaller caliber than a 155mm howitzer, the 130mm cannon seriously out-ranged the 155mm weapon. According to CIA tribal road watch spy teams, the PAVN also reinforced with at least 6,400 fresh troops. Once again, as in Campaigns 139 and 74B, the PAVN fielded a combined arms force. This time it appeared to contain two full divisions. Major General Le Trong Van, fresh from successfully commanding an army corps of PAVN troops in Operation Lam Son 719, was picked to command the upcoming Campaign Z. General Vu Lap, who had commanded Campaign 139, was his deputy.Ahern, pp. 434-435.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 323-324. Campaign Z =The initial push= The annual Hmong New Year kicked off on 16 December 1971; many officers found their way rearward from their front-line units to the celebration.Conboy, Morrison, p. 323. There was unseasonable rain on 17 December, grounding aviation. Campaign Z began with a PAVN drive down the Ban Ban Valley. The strike force consisted of the 335th Independent Regiment, mechanized infantry of the 316th PAVN Division's 174th Regiment, the 27th Sapper Battalion, and the 195th Armored Battalion. New to the fighting in northern Laos were T34 tanks and armored personnel carriers. The PAVN objective was the destruction of two Royalist guerrilla regiments, Groupement Mobile 21 (GM 21) and Groupement Mobile 23 (GM 23).Conboy, Morrison, p. 324. Simultaneously, the 312th PAVN Division retraced its previous successful line of attack, driving down Route 72 at Groupement Mobile 22 in the southeastern PDJ. Anticipating the PAVN arrival, the guerrillas began to abandon their weapons as they sifted to the rear past the Thai fire bases. With their light infantry screen withdrawn, the Thai fire bases now came under attack. The PAVN used a new tactic of counter-fire on the batteries to coop the Thai gunners in their bunkers. It would lift this fire in bare time for its infantry to overrun the fire bases. Without time to react, many of the Thais were trapped in their bunkers.Anthony, Sexton, p. 353. On 18 December 1971, in another first for the northern Lao theater of war, the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) unexpectedly challenged the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) air supremacy. The VPAF thrust by MiG 21s disrupted the entirety of the air war over the PDJ. All strikes had to be called off; bomb loads had to be jettisoned willy nilly. The propeller driven craft fled due west to escape the MiGs. U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom II fighters turned to fight the VPAF. The USAF lost three F-4s that day.Conboy, Morrison, p. 325. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) for the downed fliers on 19 December absorbed fifty aircraft in its efforts, leading to another day of weak tactical air support for the Royalists. Even after the end of the CSAR, air support was weakened by necessary countermeasures to MiG 21 intrusions, whether real or feinted. The end of the Thai fire bases came on 20 December; all six of them were overrun. Nor were the Hmong home free; one battalion of 800 suffered about 200 wounded, and nearly that many killed.Ahern, p. 437. Overall, Royalist casualties for the three days combat were 286 killed, 418 wounded, and 1,500 missing. The Royalists also lost 24 howitzers to the Communists. =The battle for Skyline Ridge= On 21 December 1971, the 174th PAVN Regiment, backed by the 14th Antiaircraft Battalion, took Hill 1663. From its summit, they poured plunging fire on the nearby Royalist position at Ban Na until it was evacuated.Conboy, Morrison, p. 327. Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) arrived from Military Region 3 to reinforce the Royalists on 22 December. By 28 December, MR 2 had received six Lao battalions and 11 replacement howitzers; 25 more of the latter were en route. On 30 December, Groupement Mobile 30 (GM 30) arrived as additional reinforcement. By now, half of the 4,000 guerrillas that had succumbed to the initial PAVN attacks were still unaccounted for. The situation was desperate enough that 111 B-52 sorties had struck in support of the Royalists during December. The PAVN shot down six T-28 Trojans and three Phantoms during the same period.Ahern, pp. 437-438.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 327-328.Anthony, Sexton, p. 354. On 30 December 1971, Communist forces attacked Sala Phou Khoun, a strategic intersection in the Royalist rear; the counter for this would become Operation Maharat. The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. They blew up the main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers followed him to a smoky hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest. There they found him ill, depressed, weeping, and cursing the lack of air support. He returned to Long Tieng with them. They took him to hospital on 4 January, to be admitted for treatment of viral pneumonia.Ahern, p. 438.Conboy, Morrison, p. 329. By 5 January 1972, about 600 rounds of 130mm explosives had hit Long Tieng. Radio intercepts of PAVN messages revealed 24 PAVN battalions were poised to attack the Royalists. On the Royalist side, both GM 21 and GM 23 had been mauled into uselessness. Eight of the Royalist infantry battalions had been relieved for refitting. Given the gravity of the PAVN threat to the Long Tieng base, its aviation operations were dispersed away from Communist reach. The TACAN air navigation system on Skyline Ridge was moved 20 kilometers further south to another mountaintop. Flight operationswhether RLAF, Air America, or Continental Air Services, Inc followed the refugee relief effort, which had been transferred from Sam Thong to nearby Ban Son. In Vang Pao's absence, discipline slipped; there was some looting by both Thais and Hmong.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 329-330. On both 7 and 9 January 1972, PAVN sappers penetrated Long Tieng's defenses in raids against the 20 Alternate airfield there. On 11 January, CIA case agents began construction of hardened bunkers for protection from shell fire. That same day, PAVN troops from the 335th Independent Regiment, the 148th Regiment, and 14th Antiaircraft Battalion overran a Royalist guerrilla battalion, pushed GM 23 out of the way, and attacked Long Tieng from the north, northeast, and east. They pushed a Thai mercenary battalion from the Charlie Alpha helicopter landing zone, the highest point on Skyline Ridge overlooking Long Tieng. Meanwhile, down south in Bangkok, the deputy chairman of the National Executive Council floated the idea that the Hmong could relocate to Thailand to escape the war.Conboy, Morrison, p. 330. On 12 January, GM 30 was lifted back to the base of Skyline Ridge and ascended to the Charlie Echo landing pad on its western end. On 14 January, two Thai battalions were brought in to seize both ends of the Ridge. The subsequent eastward assault along the ridgeline on 17 January by GM 30 was supported by the Thais, artillery fire, and B-52 strikes. By 18 January, the Hmong irregulars had reclaimed all but the eastern end of the ridge at a cost of 35 killed and 69 wounded.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 330-331. Media reaction On 14 January, the PAVN's daily newspaper, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, proclaimed victory at Long Tieng. On 16 January, they ran a detailed account of the \\"victory\\", complete with campaign map.Conboy, Morrison, p. 334 note 29. The fighting had garnered the attention of foreign correspondents, who now deemed it \\"the most important battleground of the Indochina war\\". Previously denied access to the secretive base at Long Tieng, on 19 January the journalists were finally granted entry. Two helicopter loads of reporters from United Press International, The New York Times, Associated Press, and other media outlets were flown in after swearing not to reveal the identity of any CIA personnel on site. They were shuttled about the battlefield, with a doughty few electing to be convoyed in to the GM 30 positions. While there, a few mortar shells dropped in nearby. When a medevac helicopter came in, the unhurt journalists barged aboard before a wounded Thai officer could be loaded. A later medevac had to be called in for the wounded major after the reporters departed.Conboy, Morrison, p. 331. The journalists changed their mind about an overnight stay at Long Tieng, and were flown back to Vientiane later that day.Ahern, pp. 444-445. =Retreat of PAVN= On 20 January 1972, two PAVN battalions attacked Skyline Ridge, inflicting 45 casualties on GM 30. After their retreat, their position was occupied by a Royalist guerrilla battalion advised by CIA case agent George Bacon, call sign Kayak. Also, by 24 January, GM 30 and two Royalist guerrilla battalions swept the remaining PAVN from Skyline Ridge. By then, four supporting Thai artillery positions had been set up in an arc about nine kilometers south of Long Tieng. That same day, two fresh battalions of Thais arrived as Royalist reinforcements. On 25 January, four more battalions of Thais arrived; on 27 January, two more. On 30 January 1972, GM 30 was relieved and flown home to Military Region 3. Vang Pao shuffled his troops into the best possible defensive positions. Once again, the PAVN had come up short on capturing Long Tieng.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 331, 334. Result As in Campaign 139, the PAVN pulled up just short of overrunning Long Tieng and ending the Laotian Civil War. The Royalists were battered and in questionable shape to undertake an offensive. With further North Vietnamese offensives in the offing, the American government found itself presented with a double-edged dilemma. L'Armee Clandestine was the only Lao military force still ready to fight in northern Laosbut barely ready. Continued defense of Long Tieng could lead to their defeat and loss of the war. On the other hand, removing the Hmong from their traditional homeland might irretrievably break their fighting spirit, and lose the war. However, Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley, who actually directed the war, believed that with the PAVN being attrited by air strikes, the Hmong could endure. Besides, Vang Pao had returned from hospital, and Hmong morale consequently perked up. On the other hand, CIA Chief of Station Hugh Tovar believed that the Lao were becoming disgusted with the Americans risking only money and supplies while Lao were being killed.Ahern, pp. 446-448.Castle, p. 111.

Hurwitz is also a producer, singer, and songwriter based in Los Angeles, United States.  Early life  Born in 1979 in Israel to American Parents Ira and (Dr.) Judy Lieman- Hurwitz. Sean found his love for music at a very young age, through his exposure to Israeli artists such as Gidi Gov and Mashina and British artists such as Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd. Hurwitz had his first experience playing a musical instrument at age 7, when he started taking piano lessons. It was his introduction to the movie \\"Back to the Future\\" that ignited his desire for a totally different instrument. After watching Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) rock out on a Gibson ES- 345 electric guitar to \\"Johnny Be Good\\" (Chuck Berry), Hurwitz knew that he was meant to pick up his own guitar and perform live in venues all over the world. His parents bought him his first guitar not long after Hurwitz expressed his desire to play, and his father taught him his first few chords. Over the ensuing years, Hurwitz continued to teach himself guitar, while also being given the opportunity to learn about producing successful live shows. Years later, by age 21, he would become a very popular audio engineer and stage tech in Israel. While working closely with all the great Israeli artists at that time, Hurwitz never forgot his original dream, which was to play and perform music for a living. At age 23, after a terrorist attack in Israel affected him very personally, he decided that he couldn't afford to waste any more time and moved to LA to follow that dream.  Los Angeles career  Hurwitz paid his dues and worked his way up the LA music scene while playing with many unsigned solo artists & bands. It was during this time that Sean would meet his good friend and drummer Randy Cooke, who would eventually help him get his first signed artist gig with Singer Songwriter Anna Nalick. Hurwitz then joined Nalick on the road while she promoted her second Studio Album \\"Shine\\". Over the years, Sean has also had the pleasure of sharing both stage and studio with many artists including Enrique Iglesias, Smash Mouth, Gin Blossoms, Chris Wallace, and many more.

History Bipp Castle in 1743 The 1855 mansion built near the ruins of Bipp Castle During the 12th century the Bishop of Basel granted the Buchsgau region, which included the village of Oberbipp, to the Count of Froburg to hold as a fief. By 1268 Bipp Castle is first mentioned in a document. During the 13th century the counts of Froburg appear to have gradually lost most of their holdings in the Buchsgau until only the villages of Bipp, Wiedlisbach and Erlinsburg remained. At some point in the following years the Froburgs also lost ownership of Bipp Castle, though whether it was sold or captured is not clear. In 1297 Count Rudolf of Neuch√¢tel-Nidau granted the castle to one of his Ministerialis knights. Then, in 1313 Rudolf‚Äôs son, also a Rudolf, granted the castle and the right to collect tolls on the bridge to Aarwangen. In 1362 Count Rudolf of Nidau became the Lord of Froburg along with his other titles. However, when he died childless his estates were divided between several family members. Eventually, Rudolf of Kyburg inherited the castle and surrounding lands. Following a disastrous Kyburg raid on Solothurn which led to the Burgdorferkrieg (1383-84), the lands were sold to the Habsburgs in 1385. In the following year Bipp went to Basel and then in 1406 back to the Kyburgs, who had to sell it to Solothurn and Bern in the same year. Until 1463 Bern and Solothurn jointly administered the nearby villages from Bipp Castle. After this, Solothurn received the Neu-Bechburg vogtei and Bipp became fully part of Bern. The castle became the seat of the Bernese ‚Äò‚Äôlandvogt‚Äô‚Äô or reeve. Over the following three centuries a total of 62 Bernese administrators ruled over the region. On 2 March 1798 the French Army captured Solothurn during their invasion of Switzerland. The last Bernese landvogt fled Bipp Castle ahead of the invading army. The residents of Oberbipp and Niederbipp then plundered the castle, taking everything they could carry off. A French report from 16 March 1798 records that the castle was uninhabitable because even the windows and doors had been carried off. The ruins of Bipp Castle were sold in 1805 and were partly demolished to provide stone for other buildings. In 1855 the ruins were sold to the Stehlin family of Basel, who built a small mansion on the site of the former castle granary. Castle site The castle was built on hill near the village of Oberbipp. The castle was an elongated polygon with a massive palas on the eastern side and a slender, round bergfried on the west, connected by a line of buildings. The northern side of the castle was a curtain wall connecting the palas and bergfried. The main wall was further protected with a lower, outer wall with several round and square towers. A granary and stables were outside the wall on the southern flank of the castle hill.

Manley is located in Chino, California. Company origins Recording and film engineer David Manley began designing high fidelity vacuum tube amplifiers in South Africa in 1980. The earliest units he produced were modified LEAK amplifiers. In 1983 the first Vacuum Tube Logic (VTL) tube power amplifiers and preamplifiers went into full-fledged production for the European market in the UK. David, joined by his son Luke introduced the amplifiers to the US market at the 1986 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where the positive reception convinced them to expand their distribution to the U.S.. Production was eventually moved to Chino, California as Vacuum Tube Logic of America, Inc. and a secondary brand Manley was established in 1988, first producing what was conceived as upper echelon high fidelity vacuum tube power amplifiers and preamplifiers for the high fidelity home market. In 1989, the first products tailored specifically for professional studio use under the Manley brand were created, namely the 60 dB Microphone Preamplifier followed by the Manley Enhanced Pultec Equalizer. By 1993, the Manley brand had expanded, encompassing a complete range of studio products from microphones, dynamic units, equalizers, converters and specialized mastering products. In April 1993, David Manley and Luke decided to part ways, with Luke creating a new company, VTL Amplifiers, Inc., and David (and his wife EveAnna Dauray Manley) opening a new factory, Manley Laboratories, Inc.. Inspired by her stepfather Albert J.

He showed great promise as a two-year- old in 1999, winning a maiden race on his debut and then taking the Group One Racing Post Trophy. In an abbreviated second season he was disqualified after winning the Prix Greffulhe and ran poorly when strongly fancied for The Derby. He was then sold and exported to Singapore where he won twice and finished second in the Singapore Derby. He retired with a record of four wins from twelve starts in five different countries. He stood as a breeding stallion in Australia before moving to Ireland in 2009. Background Aristotle was a bay horse with a large white star and four white socks bred in Ireland by Orpendale, a breeding company associated with John Magnier's Coolmore Stud. He was from the twelfth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Aristotle's dam Flamenco Wave was a lightly-raced but high-class racehorse who won the Moyglare Stud Stakes in 1988. She was even better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including Starborough and Ballingarry. Her unraced daughter Leaping Water became the dam of St Nicholas Abbey. Flamenco Wave was one of many good horses descended from the American broodmare Fleet Flight: others have included Almutawakel and White Muzzle. The colt initially raced in the colours of John Magnier's wife Susan and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= Aristotle began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Galway Racecourse on 26 July 1999 and started at odds of 4/5 against seven opponents. Ridden by Mick Kinane he took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on in the closing stages to win by four and a half lengths from the Dermot Weld-trained Huangdi. The colt was then moved up sharply in class when he was one of three O'Brien-trained colts to be sent to England contest the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 23 October. Of the Ballydoyle trio Kinane rode the Dewhurst Stakes third Zentsov Street and P J Scallan partnered the Beresford Stakes winner Lermontov whilst the ride on Aristotle went to the experienced English jockey George Duffield. The 2/1 favourite was the Somerville Tattersall Stakes winner Scarteen Fox (later renamed Best Light) whilst the other five runners were Cornelius (third in the Coventry Stakes), Holding Court, Air Marshall, Ekraar (Vintage Stakes) and the 50/1 outsider Optimaite. Starting at odds of 10/1 after strong late support in the betting Aristotle tracked the leaders as Lermontov made the running but looked outpaced when Ekraar went to the front three furlongs out. He stayed on strongly however, gained the advantage inside the final furlong, and won by one and a quarter lengths and a neck from Lermontov and Ekraar. Duffield said of the winner \\"He has a great future. He's very laid-back but very brave. He wants to win. He went down to post like a bird\\". When asked about Aristotle as a Derby prospect O'Brien commented \\"I haven't seen one to beat him yet. He's tough, he's got class, and he stays\\" and added \\"You wouldn't believe how lazy this horse is. You only get what you ask from him but we always thought he was very good. All he does is eat and sleep. If you worked him with a donkey he would probably beat it a neck!\\". =2000: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Aristotle was sent to France for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 23 April. Ridden by Kinane, he took the lead 800 metres from the finish and drew clear in the closing stages and won by three and a half lengths from Rhenium. However, he had veered left repeatedly in the straight, hampering the third- placed finisher Boutron, and after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards he was disqualified and demoted to third. Kinane commented \\"Aristotle ducked to the left on three occasions. It was something he's never done before. If he'd kept straight, we'd have won the race by 10 lengths\\". On 10 June, Aristotle was one of fifteen colts to contest the 2000 Epsom Derby at and started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Beat Hollow and Sakhee. O'Brien had been in very confident mood in the build-up to the race describing the colt as \\"the best Derby horse we've had\\" and \\"perfectly made\\" for Epsom. In the event, Aristotle turned into the straight in fifth place but soon began to struggle and was eased down by Kinane in the closing stages to finish tenth behind Sinndar. Aristotle was sold in August 2000 and sent to race in Singapore where he was trained by Malcolm Thwaites, a multiple champion in both Singapore and Malaysia. =2001: four-year-old season= Aristotle took some time to settle in Singapore (where he was renamed Our Aristotle) and did not reappear until 2001. Racing at Kranji Racecourse he won the Singapore New Year 2000 over ten furlongs on 7 January, finished fifth in race three weeks later and then ran third to the German challengers Silvano and Caitano when favourite for the Singapore Cup on 3 March. He was then sent to the United Arab Emirates for the Dubai World Cup on dirt at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 24 March and finished tenth of eleven behind Captain Steve. On his return to Singapore he finished sixth in the second running of the Singapore Airlines International Cup in May and was then runner-up to Bocelli in the Singapore Derby in June. In August he recorded his second win in Singapore when he won the Three Rings Trophy. On his final racecourse appearance he finished unplaced in the Singapore Gold Cup at Kranji in November. Stud record At the end of his racing career Aristotle was retired to become a breeding stallion. He stood for several years at the Lynden Stud, Victoria, Australia before returning to Ireland in 2009. He was expected to be auctioned that summer but was bought privately and resumed his stud career at the Steeple Stud in County Wexford.

Common names for this fish include Pacific hatchetfish, deepsea hatchetfish and slender hatchetfish. It inhabits the mesopelagic zone and is either non-migratory or performs short daily vertical migrations. Description Argyropelecus affinis is a small laterally compressed fish with a standard length of up to . It has a vertical mouth and tubular eyes that are directed upwards. There is a short spine in front of the operculum but no spine behind the eye. The dorsal fin has 9 short soft rays and there is also a dorsal adipose fin. The pectoral fin has 11 or 12 soft rays, the pelvic fin 6 and the anal fin 13. There are several short post-abdominal spines. The swim bladder is gas-filled and well-developed. This fish has a dark-coloured back and silvery sides, with darker pigment along the lateral line. The scales have a tendency to detach and adult fish have rows of photophores on the underside. Distribution and habitat This species is circum-global and is found in the warmer parts of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is plentiful off the coast of West Africa from about 10¬∞S northwards, and is present as far south as 15¬∞S near Madagascar. It is usually found in the mesopelagic zone. During the day, trawls at depths between produce the highest catches and at night the greatest abundance of fish is in the depth range ; this indicates that some, but not necessarily all, fish make short daily vertical migrations. Ecology Adult Argyropelecus affinis feed on planktonic organisms, salps, krill, arrow worms, copepods and ostracods. Smaller fish consume mainly copepods and ostracods, and their adult arrangement of photophores develop when they are about long. The lenses of the eyes of A. affinis contains yellow pigments that absorb short-wave radiation; the proportions of the two carotenoid-like pigments present change as the fish grows older. It is not clear what precise function is served by the pigments, but with some of the incident illumination being absorbed, the fish's absolute sensitivity to light must be reduced. Status A. affinis is a common fish and is abundant in many parts of its wide range. No specific threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

In 2012, both Hammonds were charged with several counts in relation to two fires in 2001 and 2006, and eventually convicted of two counts of arson on federal land. Knowing they would face the statutory minimum of five years, the men waived their right to appeal these convictions in exchange for dismissal of several unresolved charges. After this mid-trial agreement was entered, the Hammonds were sentenced to a few months in jail, which they served. In 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated these sentences because they were shorter than the statutory mandatory minimum. The Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court for resentencing. The district court subsequently re-sentenced both Hammonds to the mandatory minimum of five years in prison, with credit for time served. By late 2015, the Hammond case had attracted the attention of Nevada activists Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who planned a protest against the re-sentencing, though the Hammonds rejected their assistance. However, the protest still went into effect on January 2, 2016, and resulted in the Bundys and associates staging a 40-day armed occupation of the headquarters area of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. On July 10, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump issued full pardons to Dwight and Steven Hammond. Background =Location= Harney County is a rural county in eastern Oregon. The county seat is the city of Burns. Although it is one of the largest counties by area in the United States, its population is only about 7,700, and cattle outnumber people 14-to-1. About 75 percent of the county's area is federal land, variously managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the United States Forest Service (USFS). Besides ranching and farming, forestry and manufacturing are important industries in the county. The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, located in Harney County, was established in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt, a conservationist. Located in the Pacific Flyway, and currently encompassing , it is \\"one of the premiere sites for birds and birding in the U.S.,\\" according to the Audubon Society of Portland. Tourism, especially birding, injects million into the local economy annually. =Cattle ranching tensions in Harney County= Cattle ranching in Harney County predates the 1908 establishment of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, with some cattle trails, including those used by the Hammond family, dating back to the 1870s. Disputes between cattle ranchers and the federal government over management of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have gone on for \\"generations\\" and the situation has regularly deteriorated to taunts and threats directed at federal officials from ranchers since at least the early 1970s. In an effort to address concerns of neighboring landowners and interests, the completion of a 15-year management plan for the refuge heavily involved various stakeholders, including ranchers, in its development process. The plan was completed in 2013 and won praise from some area ranchers for its collaborative approach. Story originally published January 9, 2016, with title \\"Occupied Oregon wildlife refuge known for listening to ranchers.\\" In June 1994, the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge manager, Forrest Cameron, notified Dwight Hammond that his permit to graze his cattle and grow hay on the refuge was revoked. Two months later, Hammond and his son Steven obstructed the completion of a refuge boundary fence intended to keep their cattle out of the refuge's protected marsh and wetland, prompting their arrest by federal agents. The fence was needed to stop the Hammonds' cattle from moving onto the refuge after the ranchers had repeatedly violated the terms of their special permit, which limited those times when they could move their cattle across refuge property. Officials also reported that Dwight had made death threats against refuge managers in 1986, 1988, 1991, and 1994, stating, \\"he was going to tear his head off and shit down his neck,\\" and that Steven Hammond also made incendiary remarks against them, calling the employees and managers, \\"worthless cocksuckers\\" and \\"assholes.\\" After the arrest, locals were given the names and phone numbers of refuge employees, and encouraged to harass them. One caller threatened to wrap the Camerons‚Äô 12-year-old boy in a shroud of barbed wire and stuff him down a well. Other callers warned his mother that she ought to move out before something \\"bad\\" happened to her family. She gathered their four children, one wheelchair-bound, and fled to Bend, 135 miles west. The families of three other refuge employees received telephone threats after a meeting held in support of the Hammonds, where the workers' phone numbers were circulated. Businesses in Burns displayed signs warning, \\"This establishment doesn‚Äôt serve federal employees.\\" Voters recalled a pair of Harney County commissioners because they wouldn‚Äôt put the county \\"supremacy\\" ordinance on the ballot or intervene against the refuge managers. Oregon's then-Congressional District 2 U.S. Representative, Robert Freeman Smith, protested the arrests to President Bill Clinton's United States Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. In 1999 Steven started a fire, intending to burn off juniper trees and sagebrush, but the fire escaped onto BLM land. The agency reminded him of the required burn permit and that if the fires continued, there would be legal consequences.  Arson prosecutions  Both Dwight and Steven Hammond later set more fires, one in 2001 and one in 2006, that would lead to eventual convictions of arson on federal land: The 2001 Hardie-Hammond fire began after hunters in the area witnessed the Hammonds illegally slaughtering a herd of deer. Less than two hours later, a fire erupted, forcing the hunters to leave the area but also intending to conceal evidence of the deer herd slaughter. Steven's nephew Dusty Hammond testified his uncle told him to \\"light the whole countryside on fire,\\" and that he was \\"almost burned up in the fire,\\" having to flee for his life. The Hammonds claimed they started the fire to stop invasive plants from growing onto their grazing fields. The 2006 Krumbo Butte fire started out as a wildfire, but several illegal backburns were set by the Hammonds with an intent of protecting their winter feed. The backfires were set under the cover of night, without warning the firefighters they knew were camped on the slopes above. United States' Supplemental Sentencing Memorandum (filed September 21, 2015), United States v. Hammond, Case No. 6:10-cr-60066-AA (D. Ore.). The fires threatened to trap four BLM firefighters. One of those later confronted Dwight Hammond at the fire scene after he had moved his crews to avoid the danger. Two days later, Steven Hammond threatened to frame a BLM employee with arson if he didn't terminate the investigation. Brief for the United States in Opposition, Hammond v. United States, Docket No. 13-1512. Petition for certiorari denied on March 23, 2015. See: \\"Hammond v. United States : SCOTUSblog\\" and \\"Bloomberg Law - Document - United States v. Hammond, 742 F.3d 880 (9th Cir. 2014), Court Opinion\\" for related documents. Following their release from jail on their own recognizance, a rally attended by 500 other cattle ranchers was held in Burns, Oregon in support of the Hammonds. Some charges against the Hammonds were later dropped. =Mid-trial pre-sentencing agreement= In 2012, the Hammonds were tried in federal district court on multiple charges. During a break in jury deliberations, a partial verdict was rendered finding the Hammonds not guilty on two of the charges, but convicting them on two counts of arson on federal land. Striking a plea bargain, in order to have the four remaining charges dismissed and for sentences on the two convictions to run concurrently, the Hammonds waived their rights to appeal their convictions. This was with their knowledge that the trial would proceed to sentencing where the prosecution intended to seek imposition of the mandatory five-year minimum sentences. =Sentencing hearing, appeals of the sentence, and re-sentencing= At sentencing, the federal prosecutors requested the five-year mandatory minimum under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). U.S. District Judge Michael Robert Hogan independently decided that sentences of that length \\"would shock the conscience\\" and would violate the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. On his last day on the bench before retiring, October 31, 2012, Hogan instead sentenced Dwight Hammond to three months' imprisonment and Steven Hammond to a year and a day's imprisonment, which both men served. In what was described by one source as a \\"rare\\" action, the government (represented by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon, led by U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall) successfully appealed the sentence to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It upheld the mandatory-minimum law, writing that \\"given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.\\" The appeals court vacated the original sentence and remanded the defendants for re-sentencing. The Hammonds filed petitions for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which the court denied in March 2015. In October 2015, Chief Judge Ann Aiken re-sentenced the pair to five years in prison (with credit for time served), ordering that they return to prison on January 4, 2016. Both of the Hammonds reported to Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in California on January 4, as ordered by the court. A few days earlier, the Hammonds also paid the federal government the remaining balance on a court order for restitution related to the arson fires. On January 25, it became known that Susan Hammond, the wife of Dwight Hammond, signed a document for participation in a so-called \\"citizen grand jury\\" and claimed that the paper would clear her husband of wrongdoing. The author of the paper was Joaquin Mariano DeMoreta-Folch, a Tea Party activist. The self-styled \\"citizens grand jury\\" has no legal standing, but is rather linked to the fringe sovereign citizen movement, a movement based upon conspiracy theories about the American governmentSovereign Citizens Movement, Southern Poverty Law Center. which rejects federal authority.  Presidential pardons  On June 27, 2018, Oregon's 2nd Congressional District Representative Greg Walden spoke on the House floor, requesting presidential pardons for both Steven and Dwight Hammond. On July 1, 2018, he said he spoke to the president about the case. He remarked that the original trial's federal Judge Michael Robert Hogan said that conferring the mandatory sentence would, \\"...shock the conscience.\\" The pair had pleaded guilty in a plea bargain after being convicted at trial on two charges, and acquitted on two others, with four charges remaining on which the jury had not come to a unanimous verdict. On July 1, Walden stated that President Donald Trump to whom he had spoken, was considering pardoning the Hammonds.Walden: Trump 'seriously considering' pardon for Hammonds, KOIN, Channel 6 News Staff, July 1, 2018.

Retrieved July 14, 2014. Aftermath of re-sentencing Bundy in 2014. After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the Hammonds' appeal in March 2015, the Hammonds' case returned to federal district court where they were re-sentenced to the statutory minimum of five years, with credit for time served. Meanwhile, the Oregon Farm Bureau circulated a petition seeking clemency from President Barack Obama; it had gathered more than 2,000 signatures by October 2015. Also, the Oregon Cattleman's Association, a trade group representing cattle ranchers in Oregon, established a fund to defray the Hammond's legal fees. About this time, the Hammonds' case attracted the attention of Ammon Bundy‚Äîa former car fleet manager from Phoenix, Arizona; and the son of anti- government protester Cliven D. Bundy, the central figure of a standoff with the BLM in 2014‚Äîand Ryan Payne. In November 2015, Bundy and his associates began publicizing the Hammonds' case via social media. On YouTube. Over the ensuing weeks, Bundy and Payne met for approximately eight hours with Harney County Sheriff David Ward to detail plans for what they described would be a peaceful protest in Burns, as well as also requesting the sheriff's office protect the Hammonds from being taken into custody by federal authorities. Though Ward said he sympathized with the Hammonds' plight, he declined Bundy and Payne's request. Ward then said that he subsequently received death threats by email. Unbeknownst to Ward, Bundy and Payne were simultaneously planning a takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. By late fall, local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies had become aware that members of anti-government militias had started to relocate to Harney County, and the USFWS began circulating a photograph of Ammon Bundy with instructions for staff to \\"be on the lookout.\\" Despite several early meetings with Bundy and Payne, the Hammonds eventually rejected their offers of assistance, with Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder writing that \\"neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family.\\" By early December 2015, Bundy and Payne had set up residence in Burns. The same month, they organized a meeting at the Harney County Fairgrounds to rally support for their efforts. At the meeting, a \\"committee of safety\\" was organized to orchestrate direct action against the Hammond sentences. According to that group's website, the Harney County Committee of Safety considers itself \\"a governmental body established by the people in the absence of the ability of the existing government to provide for the needs and protection of civilized society\\" (during the American Revolution, committees of safety were shadow governments organized to usurp authority from colonial administrators). =2016 occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge= On January 2, 2016, an armed group affiliated with the private U.S. militia movement held a peaceful march in protest of the Hammonds' prison sentences. Afterwards, several members of the group, consisting of Bundy, Payne, Jon Ritzheimer, and armed associates separated from the protest crowd at some point during the day and proceeded to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, away. The militants settled into the refuge and set up defensive positions. The Hammonds were convicted of arson on federal land, sentenced to five years' imprisonment, and sought clemency from the U.S. president. Bundy said he began leading the occupation after receiving a divine message ordering him to do so. The militant group demanded that the federal government of the United States cede ownership of the refuge, and expressed willingness to engage in armed conflict. For a time, the government and police did not engage directly with the militia. Dwight and Steven Hammond disavowed the occupation of the refuge. They voluntarily reported to begin serving the remainder of their respective prison sentences. On January 26, Bundy and four other militants were arrested on U.S. Route 395 about north of the occupation. One militant was lightly wounded during the arrest, and another, Robert \\"LaVoy\\" Finicum, was shot and killed by law enforcement officers while he was reportedly reaching for his gun. Several other arrests followed, and on February 11, the occupation ended when the last four militants surrendered to police. A total of 26 people, including Bundy and Payne, were charged under federal law with a single count of felony conspiracy, though more charges may be brought in due course. On Oct 27, 2016, Bundy and 6 other defendants were acquitted in Federal District Court of all charges of conspiracy and weapons violations. In August 2017, two other defendants were acquitted in Las Vegas district court on most charges, and deadlocked on the remaining charges. On Jan 8, 2018, a federal judge in Las Vegas dismissed all charges against Clive Bundy and his sons, Ammon and Ryan. Judge Gloria M. Navarro of Federal District Court, in a ruling from the bench, said that the government‚Äôs missteps in withholding evidence against the three Bundy family members and a supporter, Ryan W. Payne, were so grave that the indictment against them would be dismissed., New York Times, Courtney Sherwood and Kirk Johnson, October 28, 2016.

The mansion was built in 1881 as a summer home by liquor baron and real estate developer Henry C. Gibson and his wife, Mary B. Klett and six-year-old daughter Mary Klett \\"May\\" Gibson. Gibson named the property for his little daughter and the brook that runs through it. History Maybrook was built on a 67-acre site most of which was formerly the estate of Welsh Quaker Robert Owen Jones. Gibson‚Äôs interest in horticulture lead to the planting of oaks, maples, pines, and other evergreens on the former farmland. Rhododendron plants were also planted alongside the lawns and the stream that runs through the entire property.Rich Men and Their Castles, Lower Merion Historical Society Designed by renowned Philadelphia architects George Watson Hewitt and William D. Hewitt,G. W. & W. D. Hewitt (fl. 1878 - 1907), Philadelphia Architects and Buildings the house was purportedly meant to look like a Medieval Norman castle in Scotland. Gibson imported English stonemasons to construct the 35-room mansion that has a gross area of 20,000 square feet with a 72-foot tower. It was finished in 1881 but had later additions added by Henry Gibson‚Äôs daughter who inherited the property after his death including a library and a ballroom.The Residents, Henry C.

Upon his death, the mansion was bequeathed to his 22-year-old daughter Mary Klett ‚ÄúMay‚Äù Gibson. May never married but she did enjoy a lavish social life. In 1901 she hired George Watson and William D. Hewitt to design a ballroom 60 feet long and 50 feet high, fit for 400 people. The two story ballroom had ornately carved stone pillars, arched windows, and vaulted cathedral ceilings. A cloistered court was attached to the ballroom featuring stained glass windows by Violet Oakley, the first woman artist to receive a large commission for her work at the ornate capital building in Harrisburg. May also added a large library, a greenhouse, and a carriage house containing an artist studio for herself.A Mansion Built on Liquor Wealth and Taste for Giving, The Philadelphia Inquirer Vaulted ceilings inside Maybrook's 50 foot high ballroom in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania May often invited the neighboring community to swim in Maybrook‚Äôs pond in the summer and skate on it in the winter and had a slope built for sledding parties. She frequently opened her home to hold benefit parties for the long list of charities she supported and even hosted galas for her servants. During World War I May turned her estate into a training center for women volunteers called ‚ÄúFarmerettes‚Äù who assisted Pennsylvania farmers whose sons had gone off to war. During this time about 60 women volunteers lived at Maybrook learning to care for livestock. During World War II she helped displaced children including many from the London Blitz by allowing them to stay in her home for the duration of the war. John W. Merriam In 1950 May Gibson sold almost 10 acres in the southeast corner of the property to John W. Merriam, a real estate developer and arts patron who built the 220 unit Thomas Wynne Apartments there. In 1956 May sold the remainder of the property to Merriam and he moved into the mansion with his wife Ruth. Ruth Merriam died in 1988 and in 1992 John married Elizabeth (Betty) Lockyer who had been his secretary for forty years prior to their marriage. John Merriam died in 1994 leaving his entire estate valued at $95 million to his wife Elizabeth. Merriam was a longtime patron of the arts and after his death his wife Elizabeth carried out his wishes and donated a large portion of his estate to four Philadelphia area arts and educational institutions. In 2000, four months before she died, Betty Elizabeth Lockyer Merriam transferred the Maybrook property to her son Robert Lockyer (from a previous marriage that ended in divorce) who was head of Merloc Partners.

In 2015, for example, he and two colleagues (Michael Hennessy and Nora Draper) brought evidence from a representative national telephone survey of Americans to support their hypothesis that internet marketers are incorrect when they assert Americans give up their data after rational analyses of the benefits and privacy costs of doing that. Rather, Americans give up their data because they are ‚Äúresigned‚Äù to not being able to control data about them even though they want to do it. The findings started a wide-ranging discussion in the general press, the marketing trade press, and at the Federal Trade Commission. Turow is an elected Fellow of the International Communication Association and was presented with a Distinguished Scholar Award by the National Communication Association. In 2012, the TRUSTe internet privacy-management organization designated him a \\"privacy pioneer\\" for his research and writing on marketing and digital-privacy. For about a decade, he served as the Annenberg School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. =Books= Turow is also the author of 10 books and more than 150 articles on media industries. Among these are The Aisles Have Eyes: How Retailers Track Your Shopping, Strip Your Privacy, and Define Your Power (Yale University Press, 2017), The Daily You: How the New Advertising Industry is Defining Your Identity and Your World (Yale, 2012), Niche Envy: Marketing Discrimination in the Digital Age (MIT Press, 2006), Breaking Up America: Advertisers and the New Media World (University of Chicago Press, 1997; paperback, 1999)., and Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling and Medical Power (Oxford, 1989 and Michigan, 2013). His introductory text, Media Today: Mass Communication in a Converging World (Routledge) is in its sixth edition . He has edited five other books about the changing media landscape, including (with Lokman Tsui) The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age (Michigan, 2008) (MIT Press, 2003) and (with Andrea Kavanaugh) The Wired Homestead (MIT Press, 2003). =Lectures= Turow has been invited to give several prestigious lectures, including the Lady Astor Lectureship at Oxford University, the McGovern Lecture at the University of Texas College of Communication, and the Chancellor‚Äôs Distinguished Lecture at Louisiana State University. His chair is named after Robert Lewis Shayon, who was a prominent CBS radio producer, Saturday Review TV critic and Annenberg professor. Graduate Student Unionization In his role as Associate Dean for Graduate Studies at the Annenberg School, Turow testified on behalf of the University of Pennsylvania in relation to the unionization of its graduate students during the University of Pennsylvania vs. GETUP-UPENN National Labor Relations Board hearings. During his testimony, Turow noted the belief of many Annenberg Faculty that being a graduate teaching assistant is a key aspect of graduate education, and stated therefore that teaching assistants are fundamentally students, not employees. He admitted that large undergraduate classes would not be possible without graduate student teaching assistants but argued that Penn could instead hold smaller classes which would enable him to grade exams himself rather than relying on teaching assistants. Education and early career Turow received his Ph.D. from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania in 1976 and was appointed to the faculty at Purdue University that year. In 1986, he returned to Penn‚Äôs Annenberg School as a faculty member.

The ship, named for Archduchess Stephanie, Crown Princess of Austria, was laid down in November 1884, was launched in April 1887 and completed in July 1889. She was armed with a pair of guns in open barbettes and had a top speed of . Her service was limited, in large part due to the rapid pace of naval development in the 1890s, which quickly rendered her obsolescent. As a result, her career was generally limited to routine training and the occasional visit to foreign countries. In 1897, she took part in an international naval demonstration to force a compromise over Greek and Ottoman claims to the island of Crete. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was decommissioned in 1905, hulked in 1910, and converted into a barracks ship in 1914. After Austria-Hungary's defeat in World War I, the ship was transferred to Italy as a war prize and was eventually broken up for scrap in 1926. Design In the decades that followed the Austrian victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866, naval expenditure in the Austro-Hungarian Empire were drastically reduced, in large part due to the veto power the Hungarian half of the empire held. Surrounded by potentially hostile countries powers on land, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was more concerned with these threats, and so naval development was not prioritized.Gardiner, p. 267 Admiral Friedrich von P√∂ck argued for several years to improve the strength of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, finally winning authorization to build the center battery ship in 1875.Sondhaus, pp. 37‚Äì39 He spent another six years trying in vain to secure a sister ship to Tegetthoff.Sondhaus, p. 54 In 1881, he called for a fleet of eleven armored warships. P√∂ck's successor, Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, ultimately had to resort to budgetary sleight of hand, appropriating funds that had been allocated to modernize the ironclad to build an entirely new vessel. He attempted to conceal the deception by referring to the ship officially as Ferdinand Max, though the actual Ferdinand Max was still anchored in Pola as a school ship.Sondhaus, pp. 86‚Äì87 =General characteristics and machinery= Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of , and she displaced . Her hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames and was extensively subdivided into watertight compartments to improve the ship's resistance to flooding. The ship was equipped with a ram bow that was manufactured in Germany by Krupp. She was fitted with two pole masts equipped with fighting tops for some of her light guns. Her crew number 430 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by a pair of compound steam engines driving two screw propellers; the engines were built by Maudslay, Sons and Field of Britain. The number and type of the coal-fired boilers that provided steam for the engines have not survived, though they were trunked into two funnels. Her propulsion system was rated to provide for a top speed of . =Armament and armor= Line drawing of Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie showing the arrangement of the guns and armor Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was armed with a main battery of two 35-caliber guns mounted singly in an open barbette. They were placed forward in sponsons over the battery deck to maximize end-on fire. The guns were manufactured by Krupp, while the carriages that carried them were built by Armstrong Mitchell & Co. The guns fired a shell using a charge of brown powder, which produced a muzzle velocity of .\\"The New Austrian Ironclad\\", p. 141 While the open barbettes provided a wide field of fire for the slow-firing guns, they were rapidly rendered obsolete by the successful application of quick-firing (QF) technology to large-caliber artillery pieces. The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of six 35-caliber guns, also built by Krupp. These were mounted in gun ports amidships, three on each side. She carried nine QF guns for close-range defense against torpedo boats; seven were 44-caliber guns and the other two were shorter 33-caliber pieces, all built by Hotchkiss. Her gun armament was rounded out by a pair of 44-caliber QF guns and a pair of 15-caliber landing guns for use by landing parties. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she carried four torpedo tubes; one was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and one on each broadside. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was protected with compound armor manufactured by the Dillinger H√ºtte works in Germany.Sondhaus, p. 90 The ship was protected by an armored belt that was thick. The barbette for the main battery was thick, and the conning tower had sides that were thick. Service history Austro-Hungarian squadron in Kiel, Germany; Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie is the rearmost vessel Pola in 1916 Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was built by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste. Her keel was laid down on 12 November 1884, the last ironclad to be laid down for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was launched on 14 April 1887 and completed in July 1889.Gardiner, p. 271 The following year, the German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, invited the Austro-Hungarian fleet to take part in the annual fleet training exercises in August. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, the ironclad , and the protected cruiser were sent to Germany under the command of Rear Admiral Johann von Hinke. While en route, the squadron made visits in Gibraltar and Britain; during the latter stop, the ships took part in the Cowes Regatta, where they were reviewed by Queen Victoria. The ships also stopped in Copenhagen, Denmark and Karlskrona, Sweden. During the voyage back to Austria-Hungary, the squadron visited Cherbourg, France and Palermo, Italy.Sondhaus, p. 110 Celebrations to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first trans-Atlantic voyage were held in several countries; Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I represented Austria-Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa, Italy, Columbus's birthplace.Sondhaus, p. 112 During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was mobilized to train alongside the ironclads Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, , , and , among other vessels.\\"Naval and Military Notes\\", p. 412 In February 1897, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie deployed to Crete to serve in the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897-1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. She arrived as part of an Austro-Hungarian contingent that also included the armored cruiser , the torpedo cruisers , , and , three destroyers, and eight torpedo boats, the third-largest contingent in the International Squadron after those of the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Italy.Clowes, pp. 444‚Äì448 The International Squadron operated off Crete until December 1898, but Austria-Hungary, displeased with the decision to create an autonomous Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, withdrew its ships in March 1898.Sondhaus, p. 132 By 1898, the Austro-Hungarian Navy regarded Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie as a second-rate vessel after less than 10 years in service. The rapid pace of naval development in the late 19th century had quickly rendered her obsolescent.Sondhaus, pp. 144, 158 She was decommissioned in 1905,Sondhaus, p. 390 and in 1908, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to sell the ship, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, and Tegetthoff to Uruguay in an attempt to raise funds for new projects, but the deal fell through.Sondhaus, p. 219 In 1910, she was hulked and became a barracks ship for the mine warfare school in 1914, and served in this role for the duration of World War I. Following the conclusion of the conflict, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was ceded to Italy as a war prize in 1920 and eventually broken up for scrap in 1926.

It was known as G2 Labs, Inc. until 2013. The company was launched in May 2012 by former BigMachines employees, with a focus on aggregating user reviews for business software. Competitors of similar peer review sites (PRS) include TrustRadius, SoftwareAdvice, Gartner, Inc., Capterra, Crozdesk, and GetApp.  Service  Platform users can sign in with a LinkedIn account and can review the products they use. To encourage reviewers to participate, some users are compensated by G2 Crowd with gift cards, contest rewards and reputation points on the website. G2 Crowd attempts to identify fraudulent user reviews through an algorithm that identifies employees at companies reviewing their own products and employees at companies reviewing their competitor's product. In addition, reviews are manually screened and voted on by the community to discourage spam and unhelpful comments. G2 Crowd also requests screenshots of the reviewer using the product for verification purposes. Information from reviews is aggregated to score business software products on The GridSM, which acts as a competitor to Gartner‚Äôs magic quadrant review model. Satisfaction and market presence ratings are generated based on product reviews and market presence data, which are then used to plot products onto a quadrant. The four quadrants in a G2 Crowd Grid are Leaders, High Performers, Contenders and Niche. = Research reviews = The reviews submitted to G2 Crowd are available for public consumption. An individual researching software can build their profile and filter information provided by reviewers similar to themselves based on company size, user role and user industry.  History  In 2012 five former employees of BigMachines ‚Äì Tim Handorf, Godard Abel, Matt Gorniak, Mark Myers and Mike Wheeler ‚Äì founded G2 Crowd, with Abel serving as president. When Abel left to continue building Steelbrick (now Salesforce CPQ) with Salesforce, Handorf took over as CEO, a role he continues in today. A beta version of the review site launched in December 2012, with several thousand users testing the service before its full launch in 2013. In early 2018, G2 Crowd Cofounders Godard Abel and Matt Gorniak returned to the company after a brief period building Salesforce acquired Steelbrick CPQ. In May 2019, G2 acquired Advocately, a B2B customer advocacy platform, with the aim of amplifying customer voices and accelerating review collection.  Funding  In 2014, G2 Crowd raised $2.3 million in seed funding from investors, including Chicago Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, Andrew Filipowski, and Greg Jones, founding CEO of uBid. In 2015, G2 Crowd raised an additional $7 million in Series A funding led by Pritzker Group Venture Capital. Investors included 2014‚Äôs contributors in addition to co-founder Godard Abel, Thomas Lehrman, and Scott Dorsey. G2 Crowd announced it would use these funds to invest in its leadership and capabilities.

Rungeen belonged to the riches bourgeois of his home city Turku. He was involved in shipping and foreign trade; later he invested on milling, sawmilling, brewing, distilling, iron processing, and most importantly, shipbuilding and textile industry. Rungeen escaped to Stockholm during the Hats' War and died in exile in 1742.  Career  = Early career = Rungeen belonged to an old bourgeois family of Turku. His career as merchant began in 1711, just two years before the Russian occupation of Finland. After the almost decade-long occupation Rungeen was one of the most active Turku merchants who contributed rebuilding of the city. According to the surviving taxation documents, Rungeen was the third riches merchant of Turku. Rungeen funded for example renovation of the city hall, main guard building and a new bridge over river Aura. In 1732 he made an offer for building a new city hall but eventually a slightly more expensive plan of the City Architect Samuel Berner became selected. = Shipping = Rungeen's focus was in foreign trade. Following to the Great Northern War, there were no large merchant ships in the city. Therefore, most of the imported goods were circulated through Stockholm. In 1726 Rungeen bought a merchant ship size of just 48 l√§st,Skeppsl√§st or l√§st (Swedish) or l√§sti (Finnish) is an obsolete unit of weight measurement. L√§st = . but it was large enough to operate profitably to Amsterdam. It took until the early 1730s the city had an ocean- worthy ship; this was Ostrobothnian built S√∂dra Finlands Vapen with capacity of 250 l√§st. Rungeen owned a quarter share of the ship. S√∂dra Finlands Vapen brought every year 5 000 ‚Äì 6 000 barrels of salt from Portugal and Spain; this covered half of the demand in Turku and its vicinity. = Milling and beverage production = In the 1720s Rungeen bought large flour mills; he owned at least one watermill in Paimio and two windmills in Turku. Rungeen started wine importing and around in 1725 he rented the city brewery, which however, burned down already in 1728. In the early 1730s Rungeen invested on distillery. In 1730 Rungeen was the richest bourgeois of the city; his property was worth of 20 000 silver thalers, which was twice as much as the second richest owned. = Sawmilling and iron processing = As demand of timber increased after the Great Northern War, Rungeen invested on sawmilling. Recently introduced Dutch style fine-toothed saws increased productivity. He founded a sawmill in Inkere, Pertteli, and another one in Aro, Paimio; the latter one he started together with another Turku merchant Carl Merthen. Rungeen also bought a share of Raala sawmill in Nurmij√§rvi. The produced timber was partly used for reconstruction in Finland and partly exported. In 1738 Rungeen rented with six other merchants Teijo iron mill in Perni√∂ for five years, Kuusto iron works and Kirjakkala iron mill complex. = Shipbuilding = Rungeen started Turku shipbuilding industry in 1738 together with merchants Esaias Wechter and Gustaf Adolf Wittfooth in 1738. The company manager became Scottish born Robert Fithie. The first vessel, called Fortuna, was completed in 1739. The following ship was sold to Stockholm, but after this Rungeen got disputes with Wechter, and sold him his share of the shipyard. The last ship was finished just right before beginning of a new Russian occupation, and it left Turku transporting refugees to Stockholm. = Textile industry = Before their dispute, Rungeen and Wechter applied for a permit to start a baize manufactory in 1738. The permit was given in the following year. Rungeen carried the biggest responsibility of the construction work during Wechter participated in the Diet of Sweden. The men started a fulling facility in Littoinen and the textiles were dyed in Wechter's dyeing works. After the rift, Wechter ran the business alone. According to his own words, Rungeen had nothing to do with the baize manufactory after August 1739; however, he sold his share to Wechter just a couple of years later. Rungeen escaped when Russian army advanced to Turku. He died in 1742 in Stockholm.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped to egg- shaped leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, pale yellow to white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or cylindrical fruit. Description Eucalyptus luculenta is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth greyish to pink powdery bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and sessile, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull greyish green on both sides, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a beaked operculum long. Flowering has been observed in October and November and the flowers are pale yellow to white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or cylindrical capsule with the valves protruding above the level of the rim. The fruit have a waxy coating but are markedly glossy underneath. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus luculenta was first formally described in 1999 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected by Johnson in 1983 between the Balladonia Roadhouse and Mount Ragged. The description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (luculenta) is a Latin word meaning \\"full of light\\" or \\"bright\\", referring to the glossiness of the fruit underneath a waxy coating. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt is confined to the Mount Ragged area where it grows in sandy calcareous soils. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

It closed in 1987. History =Origins= Medical block, Leith Hospital, Mill Lane The King Street Jubilee Wing of Leith Hospital, which housed the surgical block Leith Hospital Chapel Entrance to 40's extension of Leith Hospital Nurses Home, showing plaques engraved with the mottoes Prudence and Fortitude The King James Hospital, in the Kirkgate, which was named after King James VI, who awarded a charter to the hospital, was founded in 1614. The hospital was demolished in 1822, although part of the wall can still be seen today, forming the boundary between the Kirkgate and south Leith Kirkyard. In the late 18th century the Human Society, which promotes lifesaving intervention, established a presence in Leith, at first in Burgess Close and Bernard Street and then in Broad Wynd. In 1816, a dispensary was opened, also in Broad Wynd, at number 17, a few doors along from the Humane Society room. Founded by Dr. Andrew Duncan (1744‚Äì1828), the dispensary consisted of a consulting room, a small laboratory and a single bed. In 1825, the Humane Society and the dispensary combined, to form the Leith Dispensary and Humane Society. In 1837, the Leith Dispensary and Humane Society extended their activities by moving to a large house in Quality Street, now (Maritime Street), in what effectively became a Casualty Hospital. By the 1840s, Leith was an independent burgh of some 40,000 people and pressure increased to establish and fund a new hospital. A public meeting in 1846 was called, it was agreed that the new institution would be called \\"The Leith Hospital\\"; a committee was formed and ¬£115 was collected in subscriptions. Donations made towards the hospital included ¬£1,000 from the estate of John Stewart of Laverockbank, but it was several years before agreement could be reached about the best site and for work to start. In 1850, the year before the opening of the new hospital, the Dispensary had dealt with 2,699 patients, the Casualty Hospital had treated 245 patients and the Humane Society seven patients. The new building was planned by a committee which included the provost, baillies, local ministers, businessmen and doctors. A plot of land was purchased at the upper end of Sheriff Brae in 1849. The new hospital was built facing Mill Lane and was a two-storey building, with fever patients housed on the upper floor and the Humane Society, dispensary and casualty on the ground floor. The hospital opened to patients in 1851. = The early years = Much of the funding required to maintain the hospital was raised within the local Leith community. The new hospital incorporated the functions of the Casualty Hospital and the Dispensary. The first consulting physician to the hospital was James Scarth Combe (1796‚Äì1883), best known for his 1822 description of pernicious anaemia some years before that of Thomas Addison (1739‚Äì1860) whose name remains associated with the condition. In 1875 an extension to the hospital was built in King Street to meet increasing demand for its services. Another early physician was Dr John Coldstream (1806‚Äì1863). In 1866, the hospital appointed its first district nurse, Mrs. Brown ‚Äúto carry out faithfully the doctors‚Äô orders, to instruct the relations or friends of the patient in the art of good nursing and to inculcate, and if necessary enforce, attention to cleanliness‚Äù. The hospital paid for her to attend a nursing course at King's College, London. Popular and hardworking she made 13,000 home visits in 1877 alone. In 1874, the hospital appointed its first qualified Lady Superintendent of Nursing. Two further extensions were added to the hospital in 1873 and 1888. In 1903 to mark Queen Victoria‚Äôs jubilee a new major extension, the surgical block, was opened on King Street facing the nurses‚Äô home which had been built on the opposite side of the street. The two buildings were connected by tunnel running under King Street. =Teaching for medical students= Following the establishment by Sophia Jex-Blake (1840‚Äì1912) of the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, in 1887 the Hospital Directors gave Jex Blake permission to allow her female medical students to attend Leith Hospital for comprehensive clinical teaching.Leith Hospital Board of Directors Minutes. 13 May 1886 The arrangement began well.The Scotsman 4 July 1889 In 1888, however, an incident in the hospital would lead to the demise of Jex-Blake‚Äôs School of Medicine for Women. Jex- Blake had a strict rule that students must leave the hospital by 5pm. In breach of this rule, four students stayed on to follow a case after hours. Jex-Blake dismissed two, Ina and Grace Cadell. Both successfully sued Jex- Blake and the school for wrongful dismissal. The lawsuit was widely publicised. Together with wider opposition to medical education for women at the time, this put further pressure on Jex-Blake. The Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women closed in 1898. = The 20th century = At the start of the 20th century, Leith was a modern busy hospital, at last able to meet the health needs of the community which it served. The pressure on beds was further relieved by the opening of the East Pilton Fever Hospital in 1896. In 1908 the South Leith poorhouse moved to Seafield where it later became the Eastern General Hospital. The vacated site which fronted onto Great Junction Street was bought by the hospital in 1911 in the hope that it might be used for future expansion. The Leith community was devastated by the tragic loss of many of its young men on their way to fight in the First World War. The Quintshill Rail Disaster in May 1916 resulted in 226 fatalities of whom 214 were soldiers of the 7th Battalion (Leith‚Äôs Own) Royal Scots on their way to Gallipoli. This still remains Britain‚Äôs worst rail disaster. A school of nursing was established and recognised by the general nursing Council in 1923. As communities raised funds for war memorials, the Leith community decided that their war memorial should take the form of the children‚Äôs wing for Leith Hospital. Fundraising started in 1919. Many individual benefactors supported the hospital by endowing beds, in memory of relative killed in action in the First World War. The new building, which was designed by George Simpson, opened in January 1927. The new children's wing had a royal visit from the Duke and Duchess of Kent in May 1935. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. =Closure= Leith Hospital closed in 1987, with the buildings converted to residential units. Local protests, including a petition to keep the hospital open, were unsuccessful. The building was sold for ¬£1.6 million. Six years later, the Leith Community Treatment Centre opened in Junction Place, offering a reduced range of services. In October 2011, the Edinburgh-based Citadel Arts Group published Leith Hospital Recalled, a collection of memories from 50 contributors who were treated in or worked at the hospital. The project was funded by the Leith Benevolent Trust. A play based on the stories in the book, Leith's Hidden Treasure, was produced by the same group in 2012. Written by Laure C Paterson, the play was performed as part of the Leith Hospital Project, at the 2012 Leith Festival.

She defined herself as a feminist since \\"before people called it that\\" and called herself a \\"rebel\\" and \\"anarchist\\" in the face of the neoliberal economic course of the Chilean government.  First years  Echevarr√≠a was the daughter of an aristocratic family. Her parents were Jos√© Rafael Echeverr√≠a Larra√≠n and the writer Mar√≠a Flora Y√°√±ez, and her grandfather was the politician Eliodoro Y√°√±ez Ponce de Le√≥n. Until she was eight years old she lived in France with her grandfather, who had to go into exile due to the dictatorship of General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. When she returned to Chile, she had forgotten how to speak Spanish. She studied at the Monjas Esclavas del Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s, which she would later call a \\"retrograde school\\". She then got into the Pedagogical Institute of the Universidad de Chile, and later practiced for many years as a professor of Spanish. She had dedicated twenty-two years of her life to teaching as a Literature professor. This activity did not prevent her from developing her vocation for theater where she participated as an actress, director and author in different works. Following the military coup against the socialist president Salvador Allende in 1973, M√≥nica Echeverr√≠a and her husband traveled to England where she taught literature and grammar at the Technical School , and returned to Chile in 1978. After her return, she was in charge of the Centro Cultural Estaci√≥n Mapocho. In 2016, M√≥nica Echeverr√≠a published ¬°H√°ganme Callar!. In this autobiographical work, the author remembers with sorrow her privileged childhood and carries out an acid critique and without nuances of the \\"conversos\\" a group of young dreamers who divested themselves of their revolutionary ideas of the 60s to embrace the current neoliberalism. = Marriage and sons = She married in 1944 the architect and politician Fernando Castillo Velasco and they had five children called Carmen, Cristi√°n, Fernando Jos√© (one of the leaders of the so-called community or sect of Pirque), Javier (who died in a car accident at the beginning of the 70‚Äôs) and Consuelo.  Public life  Monica Echeverria and her husband accepted an invitation of the University of Cambridge to join their teaching staff in 1973. The next they were at England, while Cristi√°n and Carmen fought clandestinely against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. They returned in 1978. During her time in the university, she became a fan of the theater and was the director of children's shows, writing pieces and, in 1955, co-founding the Teatro ICTUS. She stood out as director of children's theater and her most successful works were the serials of Quiquirico, El c√≠rculo encantado, Chumingo y el pirata de lata, Guatapique, Zambacanuta. As a writer she published her first book, Antihistoria de un luchador, in 1993, it took eight years for her to finish this 500-page biography of the unionist Clotario Blest.

Jacoba van Tongeren is the only woman to have created and led a resistance group during the war. In 1990, Yad Vashem honoured Jacoba van Tongeren as Righteous Among the Nations.Jacoba van Tongeren at Yad Vashem website Early life Jacoba van Tongeren was the daughter of Hermannus van Tongeren and Jeanne Holle. In her younger years, her father would raise her and this would have a bearing on the rest of her life. Her father was an engineer in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and as such responsible for building railway bridges in Sumatra, in the former Dutch East Indies. As a child, she would live together with her father in a moveable home for army officers in the tropical rainforest, close to the bridge under construction. She never went to primary school but received what we can call a ‚Äòmilitary education‚Äô from her father. Part of that involved inculcating military norms and values, such as great discipline and sense of responsibility. In 1916, the van Tongeren family returned to The Netherlands and from 1916 to 1922 Jacoba went to the Dutch Reformed Gymnasium in Amsterdam. This was a difficult time of social readjustment: after all, she had never lived in a family before, never had been to school and never been with peers. Still, these were the years that she made a good connection with her brother, Herman van Tongeren. Next, she was trained as a nurse in Rotterdam. She could not complete her education; a streptococcal infection thwarted her ambitions in 1928. Instead, she spent seven years in a health resort in Groenekan and the tuberculosis wards in Amersfoort. Here, she met her life companion Nel Wateler. On return to Amsterdam, she worked as a social worker for Central Care for the Unemployed. Resistance work At the beginning of the Second World War, she could still travel around the Netherlands as a social worker, in spite of the restrictions placed on ordinary citizens by the Nazi occupiers. In 1939 Jacoba's father had received the titular rank of Major General. From the moment the war broke out, he was in danger, also in no small part because of his rank as Grand Master of the Freemasons for the Grand Orient of the Netherlands. The occupiers considered Freemasonry ‚Äúinimical to the people‚Äù. Grand Masters had already been executed in Belgium, Rumania and Poland. Hermannus van Tongeren called on Jacoba to take the membership lists and other important masonic documents to safe locations. She could do this delivery work because as a social worker she faced no travel restrictions. The founders of the resistance paper Vrij Nederland got her involved in resistance work.Vrij Nederland #12, 21 March 2015, volume 76, pp.56-63 Vrij Nederland was one of the first underground publications. The young producers of VN were attempting to make contact with the Freemason's Grand Master via his daughter, Jacoba. The plan was to set up an espionage group, which would inform the Dutch people by countering German propaganda. Initially, Hermannus was reluctant to join but he then changed his mind and gave a typewriter and a mimeograph for the production of VN's first edition. After the first edition had been published (on 31 August 1940), he increased his support, offering not only money but also contacts within the masonic network. When that required travelling, he would ask his daughter Jacoba. As a result, she became acquainted with many masonic brothers and this was to benefit her resistance work in the following years. In October 1940, her father was arrested by the Germans. He died in Sachsenhausen in March 1941. In the same spring of 1941, the Germans arrested sixty-five people who had been working for the underground press. Most of them worked for VN. Jacoba lost all her contacts within that publication. She broke all further contact with VN, to ensure that no one would hear about the contacts between the paper and the Freemasons. In 1941, the Germans abolished the Central Care for the Unemployed. All social workers were redeployed by the Dutch Churches at ‚ÄòSpecial Family Care‚Äô, which was run by the Churches. The first demand of the Special Family Care board was that this work was not to be endangered, in other words: no one was to antagonize the occupier. However, Jacoba was prepared to work on requests for help that were illegal. The board asked her to take care of all cases that were not related to social work. In short, she was asked to carry out resistance work. Van Tongeren focused her work on helping people who had gone into hiding. This was dangerous work that could get you executed if caught. She created an organisation that would help people in hiding and would lead this group throughout the war. There were many reasons to go into hiding. Being Jewish and wanting to avoid deportation to the camps was one, being in the resistance was another. But there were also men in hiding who refused to do forced labour in Germany. By the end of World War II, there were 350,000 people in hiding. This large number of people needed places to stay. They also needed false identity papers and food coupons. Food, clothes, and many other things had been placed under a tight distribution system. Special fighting squads would attack the distribution offices, in order to steal those food coupons. All this required tight organisation. Groep 2000 helped many Jewish people. Ten members of the group were themselves Jewish. After the war, about ten members and workers from that group received the Yad Vashem medal, including Jacoba van Tongeren. At the beginning of the war, Jacoba's group had no name. Later, it became Groep 2000. There were 150 members, which made it a medium-sized resistance group among the dozens that were operating at the time. In 1944 and 1945, the group helped 4,500 people who were in hiding, which is significant. Groep 2000 was working throughout the country but the main activities were in Amsterdam. Two institutions supported her in secret: the Dutch Reformed Church and the Freemasons. Moving the food coupons around the country was a task that Jacoba took upon herself with regular intervals. She had designed a special vest for it; the pattern still exists. She wore it under her clothes and when it had been filled up with coupons she merely looked like a pregnant or rather large woman. These coupons transports earned her the nickname Coupon Queen. Early September 1944, the government and the Interior Army (the joint resistance forces in The Netherlands, created in September 1944) demanded more cooperation among resistance groups. H.M. van Randwijk, in charge of Vrij Nederland at the time, attempted to wrest the leadership of Groep 2000 from van Tongeren but she refused. She proposed a merger of equals between her group and Vrij Nederland, which van Randwijk found unacceptable. In the end, the First Aid posts in Amsterdam and the fighting squad went to Vrij Nederland. The rest of Groep 2000 remained independent and continued to concentrate its efforts on helping people in hiding. Van Tongeren's father had taught her the use of secret codes. He had also impressed on her to keep names and addresses hidden and never take notes. Instead, she used coded correspondence to find addresses for people who needed a safe place. She designed a numerical code, which corresponded to the members of Groep 2000, the people in hiding and all addresses. Only she and one other person knew the key to that code. In March 1945, the Germans got hold of the group's entire coded administrative system but they could not decode it. As a result, the hiding places of 4,500 people were never discovered. After the war On 23 July 1945, van Tongeren gave to Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, the commander of the Interior Army, a document that was entitled Brief historical report of the activities of Groep 2000 (Beknopt historisch verslag van de werkzaamheden van Groep 2000). But she needed to mind her health; at the end of the war she was weak and ill. She took a year's rest and then continued her occupation as a social worker. But from 1950 onwards, she was chronically ill and bed-ridden. The war had exhausted her and the streptococcal infection from the 1930s and 40s had returned. For health reasons she moved to Bergen, near the North Sea, halfway through the 1950s. Other surviving members of Groep 2000 urged her to make public all information about their activities, to which she consented. In 1965, she gave an interview to Trouw, another newspaper born from wartime resistance. She then set about writing her memoirs, sending them to a famous public radio pastor, Mr Klamer. She died before she could publish them in full. The hand-written memoirs were archived and remained unknown for almost half a century. Jacoba van Tongeren, Groep 2000 and its 150 members have remained virtually unknown, in part because of Jacoba's modesty and her post-war ill health. But the fact that the group was working entirely in code did not help matters either. Wartime camouflage also worked after the war. Only in 2015, when the book ‚ÄòJacoba van Tongeren and the unknown resistance heroes of Groep 2000', was published, the veil was lifted. It was based on the memoirs, which were discovered by accident by a son of Jacoba van Tongeren's brother. Only then a full picture of the organisation began to emerge: the group had been invisible for 70 years. Relevance of her work In a 21 March 2015 lecture, Marjan Schwegman, director of the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences explained the importance of the work done by van Tongeren and Groep 2000. The lecture was entitled 'Jacoba van Tongeren, a resistance fighter in spite of herself' and coincided with the presentation of van Tongeren's biography. The salient points were these: * Helping people in hiding was punishable by death. Still, this work was not considered to be ‚Äòreal‚Äô resistance work. In this way, many women who took care of people in hiding, were not recognised as resistance fighters. * Van Tongeren led a double life, combining a legal existence and an illegal one, social work and resistance work. There were many more men and women who used the legal position in ordinary society as a cover for their illegal work in Groep 2000: pastors, policemen, nurses, local government officials. * The questions that these memoirs raise have given occasion for a new research agenda. Clearly, there is still some unknown history that needs to be uncovered. The NIOD's new research program will highlight the role of women in the resistance movement. * Publishing her memoirs has led to fresh public debate about the need to shed more light on the role of women in the resistance movement .

She was the first Nigerian woman to become a Permanent Secretary in Nigeria. Life Felicity Akintunde was born in Okeigbo in Ondo State in 1923. Her extended family believed in traditional Yoruba religion while her parents were Christian. She was initially educated in Nigeria where her ambition was to go to university and take a degree. She obtained teaching qualifications in 1943 and she taught until 1948. She was then allowed to travel to London for one year where she would need to be content with a diploma, and not a degree, from the Institute of Education which was part of the University of London. In London, she became interested in student politics and particularly in the West African Students' Union where she was elected the second female vice-president in 1953. In the same year, she was elected the founding President of the Nigerian Women's League of Great Britain. Her new position took her to British political party conferences where she made new connections and she met Margaret Ekpo and Comfort Tanimowo Ogunlesi when they visited London to help negotiate Nigeria's new constitution. They were the only two Nigerian women involved in this important stage of creating an independent Nigeria. She was assisted particularly by her friendship with the socialist and feminist Mary Sutherland. She rejected her first name of Felicity and adopted the Yoruba name Folayegbe and its diminutive Fola. She abandoned her course and her agreement with her funding body and took a job with the post office. With her wages, she was able to fund her own studies. In June 1954, she obtained her ambition of a degree, in economics. She married and during that time she gave birth to her first child and she was recruited to assist in the Nigeriaisation of Northern Nigeria. She saw some friction with British managers in the civil service but she worked in a number of ministries. In 1968, she was the first Nigerian woman to be a permanent secretary in the Nigerian civil service. She was active in many women's organisations although her job in the civil service prevented her from taking the lead until after her retirement. After she retired she was more active and she also started a poultry farm which turned into a major business. She was a director of Nigeria Airways and other companies and was on a board of enquiry into student violence. In 2001, LaRay Denzer wrote her biography, Folayegbe M. Akintunde-Ighodalo: a public life. She died in 2005.

Origins  The term's origins are found in its two syllables: Latin (archia) or the Greek ·ºÑœÅœáŒµŒπŒΩ (archein) meaning ‚Äúthe rule of\\" and the Ancient Greek ·ø†ÃîÃÅŒ¥œÅŒ∑ (h√∫drƒì) Ionic or hƒ´dr…ô (hudra) meaning \\"water snake,\\" as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary. Hydra, also applies the Greek mythological sea monster representation.The Lernaean Hydra, is the \\"gigantic water-snake-like monster with nine heads (the number varies), one of which was immortal...Anyone who attempted to behead the Hydra found that as soon as one head was cut off, two more heads would emerge from the fresh wound,\\" as defined by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The story of Greek hero, Hercules, includes the slaying of the Lernaean Hydra as his second labor. The hydra would arise from the depts of the sea and terrorizethe land of Lerna. The immortality of the Lernaean made this feat nearly impossible, except Hercules and his nephew Iolaus defeated the monster by lighting each headless neck‚Äîthat Hercules decapitated‚Äîafire to prevent the regrowth of numerous ones. Scholars Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker's expand upon Braithwaite's concept of hydrarchy in their text, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic. The many-headed hydra stands as a symbolic representation of the multi-ethnic band of rebellious and resistant sailors seen as an imposing threat to the imperial powers who sought to exterminate them‚Äîdismember the many 'heads' of the hydra. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also provides a modern application of the term, \\"In modern English, hydra or hydra- headed can describe a difficult or multifarious situation.\\" The contemporary recognition of the \\"terraqueous globe\\" has created a wave of research regarding many modern literary scholars overlook of the unique quality concerning the maritime society or the complexity of the hydrarchy, \\"Twentieth-century literary scholars suffered from hydrophobia (Origin: Late Latin, from Greek, from hydr- + -phobia; \\"morbid fear of water\\"): they too readily mapped the land onto the sea, imagining the ocean as a metaphor for landward practices.\\" \\"The sea is an insurgent space: it violates and defies representational schemas through its liquidity, atemporality, and sheer uncontainability. The sea, according to Iain Chambers, evokes ‚Äò‚Äòthe laboratory of another modernity, in which the hegemonic time and space of capital are viewed askance, diverted, and subverted.\\"  Historical context  =Earliest unique maritime society= In the thirteenth century of Northern Europe, earlier representations of the term can be traced to conflict concerning the North and Baltic Seas. Specifically in the power structure implemented by the leader of privateers, Klaus Stortebeker. He led a fleet of pirates called the Victual Brothers. \\"Victual\\" (Origin: Latin vivo, means 'life')a band of brothers who perhaps sustained one another in their unity. They became involved in the Hanseatic League, an alliance of cities along Germany's northern coast‚Äîwhat made this alliance unique was their commercial alliance. The Hanseatic League had their own military unit and their own ships. They were able to negotiate with sovereign kings that were treated as heir equals. The Hansa could be considered one of the first practitioners of hydrarchy, which appeared and became widely used in 1630.The early seventeenth century marked a surge of expansion in regards to colonization and trade‚Äîespecially across the Atlantic Ocean. The journey across the Atlantic consisted of and served a variety of purposes: a trade route for maritime privateers serving their nation state as well as a forced route of slave transportation. The journey also created a growing political and economic interest in the sea  Contemporary scholarship and analysis  In 2000, Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker explored the revolutionary term in their text. David Armitage reviewed Linebaugh and Rediker's text in 2001, and identified the existence of two forms of hydrarchy that were interrelated and equally- influential developments that occurred between the 1670s and the 1730s. perhaps due to the interdependent nature. Armitage points out Linebaugh and Rediker's identification of, ‚Äúthe organization of the maritime state from above, and the self-organization of sailors from below.‚Äù The self-organization of sailors from below.‚Äù developed into an understanding and adherence to the pirate code or the distribution of justice. Although there was no exact uniform list of expectations as to how each individual ship would be managed, the characteristics of distributive justice enabled \\"the fair allocation of resources among diverse members of a community. Fair allocation typically takes into account the total amount of goods to be distributed, the distributing procedure, and the pattern of distribution that results.\\" This unique society, or \\"insurgent hydrarchy from below\\" consisted of castaways and slaves‚Äîa motley crew of sailors. Richard Braithwaite defined the seventeenth-century mariners of 1631 as, ‚Äúnecessary instruments are they, and agents of main importance in that Hydrarchy wherein they live; for the walls of the state could not subsist without them.‚Äù The rapid development and rise of hydrarchy took place between 1670-1730 as a direct challenge to the development of capitalism and international trade led by Western powers in Europe‚Äînotably England.This self-organization was a radical form of political order that also had the tendency to manifest in other forms exhibiting violence and piracy, \\"The ship thus became both an engine of capitalism in the wake of the bourgeois revolution in England and a setting of resistance, a place to which and in which the ideas and practices of revolutionaries defeated and repressed by Cromwell then by King Charles escaped, re-formed, circulated, and persisted.\\"  Below-deck  So the Treasure was Divided: pirates dividing their loot. The oil painting, which the illustration was of, was sold in 1905, and is currently part of the Delaware Art Museum's collection.[1] The individuals that made up this \\"below-deck\\" society consisted of sailors, slaves, and other considered outcasts of society. The term \\"motley\\" attempted to categorize this multi-racial population as the anarchic rebels. Linebaugh and Redikier, identified such individuals within the historical context of Marxism: \\"Thus falling within the statutory meaning of 'sturdy rogue and beggar' were all those outside of organized wage labor, as well as those whose activities comprised the culture, tradition, and autonomous self-understanding of this volatile, questioning, and unsteady proletariat. Marx and Engels called the expropriated a motley crowd.\\" The marginalized population protested against low wages, mistreatment, poor ship quality, and oppression. English authorities regarded the rebels as outcasts of all nations: convicts, escaped slaves, debtors, indentured servants, prostitutes, and others on the margins of society. Men were often assigned to ships, by force, as punishment for petty crimes as well as unpaid debts, they became subject to spending most of their lives on the water in the labors of desperate indentured servitude. The exhibition of a version of a centralized authoritarian master was found in the ship's master, these would normally be the merchant captains of commerce who considered themselves as the authoritarian figure or absolute master, in which they considered their ability to enact harsh punishments of flogging and even execution as they wished or deemed necessary to display their power over their maritime society. This space was a product of a maritime radical tradition ‚Äúthat also made it a zone of freedom.‚Äù The space 'below-deck‚Äù consisted of a gathering of multiple individuals from a variety of backgrounds, criminal status, and such that other upper-class individuals like Braithwaite might have condescended as savage-like and of low intelligence. They are described to discover a haven in the lower decks of the ships where the motley-crew would gather and trade their own stories, perhaps a variation of Mary Louise Pratt's coined term, \\"contact-zone\\" the blending of culture, language, and mannerisms are said to have developed in this space of the ship. A culture and language unique to the multi-ethnic and multi-racial individuals united through the same marginalized positions during the seventeenth century: \\"As the strong hands of Braithwaite‚Äôs sailors made the Atlantic a zone for the accumulation of capital, they began to join with others in faithfulness, or solidarity, producing a maritime radical tradition that also made it a zone of freedom.\\" The motley crew developed its own language within its diverse and ever- expanding population, \\"It spoke its own speech, with a distinctive pronunciation, lexicon, and grammar made up of slang, cant, jargon, and pidgin‚Äîtalk from work, the street, the prison, the gang, and the dock.\\" Richard Braithwaite uses the term when describing his late son who died at the hands of Algerian Pirates during the seventeenth century: > He was never acquainted with much civility; the sea hath taught him other > rhetoric. . . . He cannot speak low, the sea talks so loud. His advice is > seldom taken in naval affairs; though his hand is strong, his headpeace is > stupid. . . . Stars cannot bemore faithful in their society than these Hans- > kins in their fraternity. They will have it valiantly when they are ranked > together, and relate their adventures with wonderful terror. Necessary > instruments are they, and agents of main importance in that Hydrarchy > wherein they live; for the walls of the State could not subsist without > them; but least useful they are to themselves, and most needful for others > supportance. Marcus Rediker defines the community of diversity as \\"the multi-ethnic freebooters\\" which by \\"1716-1726 numbered around four thousand over the decade. They wreaked havoc in the Atlantic system\\" as the acts of trade disruption affected \\"various strategic zones of capital accumulationthe West Indies, North America, and West Africa.\\" = Black Atlantic history = Modern literary scholars have also raised the issue of the necessary inclusion of the development of black culture among the forces of cultural nationalism concerning the history of the Atlantic world. The modernity of trade also contributed to the shaping of the Black Atlantic world during the same identified transformation period of the industrial revolution. It has been estimated that approximately twelve million Africans crossed the Atlantic Ocean between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Converting to piracy  253x253px Many sailors who entered into hydrarchy, led by commercial and military power by sea, contributed to the development of the pirate code, or the development of pirate society. Linebaugh and Rediker noted that by the 18th century, many slave ships were captured and converted to pirate duties. The rise of piracy was not a new beginning however, the beginning of piracy can possibly be traced back to the Classical era‚Äîthe history surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and the Greco-Roman relations and interactions. During this period, the term pirate was often imposed upon \\"a group by their political enemies in order to de-legitimatize them and their activities (labelled ‚Äòpiracy‚Äô) in the eyes of third parties, and at the same time to present those who were applying the labels to them in a positive light.\\" Therefore the perhaps \\"deliberate misrepresentation or distortion of the nature of those communities\\" may have transcended through time itself in its application upon individuals deemed as threats to the central powers throughout history. Around approximately the fourteenth century BC, the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas exhibited the development of perhaps one of the first populations of seamen suffering from the effects of poverty and terrain unsuitable for agriculture cultivation. The \\"notorious Sea Peoples\\" were a population of individuals of humble means who resorted to piracy when fishing could not sustain the population. By the end of the War of Spanish succession, \\"as working conditions in the merchant industry rapidly deteriorated, seamen turned to the black flag by the thousands.\\" John Jessup detailed the \\"jovial life among the pirates\\" that was perceived and experienced as \\"better than working at the big slave-trading fort of Cape Coast castle.\\" The Sacking of Panama: Originally published in 1887, \\"Buccaneers and Marooners of the Spanish Main\\". Harper's Magazine.Many pirates made it a point to distinguish the functionality of their ships in stark contrast to the capital merchant counterparts as well as the Crown and Royal Navy. Two of the main facets being: one, their acquired loot from their acts of piracy were divided equally among the crew and two, the limited power of the ship captain. For the most part, pirate vessels were much more conscious about rigid class levels. Nevertheless, pirate vessels made it a common practice to place captured merchant captain at the mercy or justice of his crew; the crew of captured merchant ships were often offered a place within the pirate hydrarchy. Linebaugh and Rediker describe this established self-government uniquely:‚Äúthe pirate ship was democratic in an undemocratic age‚Ä¶egalitarian in a hierarchical age.\\" The changed and or flipped nature of the maritime society's power dynamics defined it as \\"the maritime world turned upside down.\\" Before attempts to exterminate society of pirates, there are some indications that the British empire sought to use pirates as a resource. England during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries may have found a useful nature to piracy as an added offensive player to attack it's longstanding powerful rival, the Spanish empire. According to Taylor, Queen Elizabeth I and proceeding colonial governors \\"protected and invested in pirate enterprises\\" temporarily; because of their need for larger coverage of \\"naval protection than the official navy could provide.\\" This gave to rise to the development of privateers, individuals who were \\"licensed to plunder the enemy in wartime.\\" 116x116px The suppression, extermination, and execution of the pirates occurred following the empire's no longer use of the privateers. The newly founded cooperation between the imperial authorities and the capitalist authorities such as merchants and governors presented an alliance or \\"peace [which] brought a partial demobilization of the navy and privateers, which unleashed thousands of mariners into a glutted labor market.\\" The displacement resulted in large populations of unemployment that was widespread allowing merchant captains to exploit maritime laborers through cheap wages for increased intensive manual labor. Thus gave rise to the more violent and perhaps vengeance-seeking pirate fleet which ultimately became exterminated by the British campaign in 1730 throughout Bahamas, the Carolinas, and the West Indies.  Literature  Maritime fiction or nautical fiction recreates fantastical tales of pirates and the motley crew in nostalgia for heroic naval history creating romantic and mystical stories of life at sea. Other sailors and even pirates went on to compile their travel accounts and diary entries into published works. Captain Edgar Wakeman, a river pilot, or maritime pilot turned pirate, detailed in his own diary log, about the established self-governing society as a young sailor boy aboard the Peruvian around the 1820s. In his published diary, The Log of an Ancient Mariner, Wakeman describes a hierarchical society composed of lowly sailors (below-deck) subject to the harsh nature of ship officers (above- deck). Wakeman's accounts detail the conversing sailors objection to brutality they endured on deck: \\"Boy, this ship's cursed by honest sailor men from Maine to Yokohama. She's hell afloat, she is, and most of the hands 'ud rather die than go the voyage with the bloody officers we got.\\" However, Wakeman also took note of the equal brutality on all crew members, \\"We soon found that he was as severe upon the officers as upon the crew.\\" Wakeman became aware of the established balance in power dynamics concerning the Captain and all individuals of his crew regardless of race and or position on deck: > \\"As the Peruvian butted her leaky way down the east coasts of North and > South America, bound for Cape Horn, the crew found only one pleasant aspect > to Captain Bidler's character. He was as hard upon the officers as upon the > seamen. For men who had been beaten and kicked about the decks by the mates, > it was pleasant, when the captain appeared on the scene, to watch him work > the mates over with equal brutality.\\" The fantastical nature of the piracy and the pirate band permeated children's literature as well. American author and poet Bret Harte wrote The Queen of the Pirate Isle in 1886 about children's role-play imitating the behavior of a pirate band. The fantastical quality complimented the age of the protagonists as they engage in dreamlike fantastical imaginary adventures as a reduced, younger, and perhaps innocent portrayal of the motley crew, as their pirate band is also of mixed ethnicity, including the racist portrayal of a young Chinese page. The independent and liberation notion desired by the children is used to portray the zone of freedom, \\"possibly there was a fascination in the fact that their parents had forbidden them to go...it was also felt to be the first real step towards independence...there was a manifest need of some well define piratical purpose...they gazed at each other.\\"  See also  * Pirate code * Distribution of justice * Piracy Notes Category:Organizational theory Category:Maritime history ","title":"Hydrarchy"},{"id":"49465291","text":"A CommonSense Revolution is a book written by Ben Murray-Bruce, a Nigerian businessman and politician.

They have been compared to a harp, or other instruments of music. Byzantine psalters stand out in historically because of the religious and spiritual artistic qualities the Byzantine Empire was known for. This includes images and icons painted by hand. The art within the Byzantine psalters were specifically unique because of the history surrounding the creation and use of images two centuries before during opposition to icons in the Iconoclastic controversy. A psalter is a book made specifically to contain the 150 psalms from the book of Psalms. Psalters have also included the odes or canticles, which are songs or prayers in song form from the Old Testament. Psalters were created purely for liturgical purposes, and the Psalms were the most popular books of the Old Testament in Byzantium. The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium observed, \\"Like a garden, the book of Psalms contains, and puts in musical form everything that is to be found in other books, and shows, in addition, its own particular qualities.\\" Additionally, psalters could be used as a form of guided prayer or meditation.

He describes himself as an archpriest and scribe of the monastery. Furthermore, he has defined himself within this last role in two ways: he has both written and written in gold this manuscript. Clearly, Theodore should be identified with the hands-on production of this work. The second name is the abbot of the monastery, Michael, who is described as the divinely inspired father and synkellos of the monastery and about whom we have no other firm information. The colophon shows that Michael is to be understood as the patron of this book, which was made at his order. The Stoudios Monastery was known for its rigorous academic and artistic excellence, and especially in the Byzantine style of religious icons. A protopresbyteros is an archpriest‚Äîa kind of clerk and monk. Liturgy and the Psalms The Byzantine Empire witnessed a very prolific movement in the creation of art. The legalization of Christianity by Emperor Constantine in 313 inspired works of art linked to this new religious movement, specifically icons, and they became very popular, and the quintessential art form from Byzantine. Church services created and inspired by religious devotion were called liturgical services. Liturgy was the concept behind icons, ceremonies or rituals, and the creation of religious books. The act of reading the Psalms was not new. It was thought that icons created a mental universe for the reader imbued with images derived from texts. Art History Professor Herbert L. Kessler believes such manuscripts were created to transport the reader to a different place, a place with high spiritual aspirations. He mentions an illuminated manuscript, the Gospel of St. Luke, and writes, \\"This eleventh-century manuscript demonstrates a trend of the High Middle Ages in which transcendental contemplation was initiated by abstract means. Here, thin washes of celestial colors elevate the animal flesh itself, the vellum on which words and pictures are elsewhere inscribed, to guide the viewer's thoughts from the physical world toward (though not all the way to) the invisible God.\\" Illustrations and Images Theodore PsalterCourtesy of the British Library; London, U.K. The Theodore Psalter features 440 miniatures, or illustrations. They are ‚Äòmarginal‚Äô miniatures; they appear in the margins of the book. The miniatures include illustrations from the Gospels, liturgical illustrations and hagiographical miniatures, or stories about Christ. The word miniature means illustration, and originates with the word minium, which had nothing to do with size or the word ‚Äòminimum‚Äô. Instead, the word refers to the red lead of the pencils used in the 9th Century for these psalters. Throughout the psalter there are both red and blue lines connecting the miniatures to text, much like the way we today link text to photos or other websites. The Theodore Psalter miniatures convey allegorical meaning from the Psalms or the Odes, and have \\"an extra layer of meaning supplied by images displaying vigorous anti-Iconoclastic propaganda\\". One example is Mathew commenting on the Psalms. There are animals: goats and dogs: mice and birds including pelicans; a dragon and unicorn; and a Tree of Life. There are men playing music, and vegetation. Professor Barber continues his commentary on the Psalter, \\"The image and prayer on folio 207v develop our understanding of Michael's possession of the book. A blessing bust of Christ can be assumed in the medallion. Below and to the right is a standing figure of David, clearly labeled, wearing royal costume and carrying a psaltery. Between them, and now almost lost, is the faint trace of a third figure. This bearded man carries a book in his left hand, looks up toward Christ, and gestures with his right hand. He is identified by the text written around him: \\"Our most Holy Father Michael, the abbot and synkellos, the Stoudite says...He says, \\"Savior, take hold of the finished book of your prophet and wise king.\\" The image and text together indicate that thePsalter is shown in the left hand of Michael. David is identified as the author of the Psalms, but it is Michael who possesses, for the moment, the Psalter. (see Essay 3). It is his to give to Christ. The manuscript's final opening provides a writer-producer (Theodore), a patron-pssessor (Michael), an ordinary author (David), and a national recipient (Christ). In addition, the texts indicate that the manuscript was completed in February 1066. Taken together, this information provides rare precise details on the location of the production and the possession of a Byzantine Illuminated manuscript. As such, the Theodore Psalter necessarily provides a fixed point in any discussion of eleventh- century Constantinopolitan illumination.\\" This kind of scene occurs throughout the Psalter, and there are surprising examples. Professor Robin Cormack writes in his book Byzantine Art about the Theodore Psalter. Patriarch Nikephoros, an Orthodox patriarch who supported the use of icons 250 years before, during the Iconoclastic Debate, appears in the text, and there are conversations, but there is a surprising twist. He is replaced by a monk who had lived at the monastery at the same time. That monk was Theodore the Studite who was made a saint after his death, and who had been persecuted for actively supporting the making and the using icons. Professor Cormack writes, \\"The prominent role of Patriarch Nikephoros, as triumphant iconophile is replaced with portraits of the monk St. Theodore the Studite. Natural though it was to celebrate a past member of the community in which the manuscript was made, it slants the opposition to iconoclasm away from patriarch to monk.\\" Miniature from the Theodore Psalter. Courtesy of the British Library. There is another interesting detail, and that is the image of the pelican in the manuscript. Eriko Tsuji wrote an article about the Theodore Psalter and the appearance of the image of a pelican, \\" Where both the Chludov (Moscow, Historical Museum, 129d) and the Barberini Psalters show a bird nesting on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17 (\\"There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them,\\" the Theodore Psalter has precisely the same composition at Psalms 101:7, \\"I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl in the ruined house\\"). Theodore must have moved the miniature intentionally because he added a new motif instead of the bird on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17. The illustration of the bird on a column was regarded as a pelican in the Theodore Psalter because of the relationship to the word \\"Pelican\\" in the text. Though the miniature of the pelican itself is now lost, we have a photograph of the miniature of Crucifixion interpreting a fable of the pelican. It is obvious among the monks of the monastery that the pelican can be considered as an image of the Passion of Christ. The miniature cycle of the Theodore Psalter was devised for the abbot of the monastery. By examining the miniatures as a product of the highly intellectual culture of the monastery, we can speculate that the modification by Theodore is a reflection of the interests and concerns of the Stoudios monastery in the eleventh century.\\"  Experience of the Icon  Art historian and Stanford professor Bissera Pentcheva points out that the icon must be experienced with the senses: > \\"Focusing on the Byzantine icon, this study plunges into the realm of senses > and performative objects. To us, the Greek word for icon, designates > portraits of Christ, Mary, angels, saints, and prophets painted in encaustic > or tempera on wooden boards. By contrast, eikon in Byzantium had a wide > semantic spectrum ranging from hallowed bodies permeated by the Spirit, such > as the Stylite saintes or the Eucharist, to imprinted images on the surfaces > of metal, stone, and earth. Eikon designated matter imbued with divine > pneuma, releasing charis, or grace. As matter, this object was meant to be > physically experienced. Touch, smell, taste, and sound were part of \\"seeing\\" > an eikon.\\" Text and Script There are two kinds of script used in the Theodore Psalter. One is called majuscule, and is a kind of calligraphy consisting of large or upper case letters. In the Theodore Psalter the majuscule lettering appears in gold. The other kind of text or script used in the manuscript is a smaller text called minuscule. It is also a kind of calligraphy established in the 8th and 9th century by Charlemagne and revived during the Italian Renaissance. Minuscule is the foundational script that forms the basis of the present day Roman upper and lower case type. These small letters appear in red and gold throughout the text, and the cover has those same colors in majuscule. > Professor Barber adds, \\"the predominant script is a minuscule perlschrift > typical of the eleventh century. A gilded majuscule is used for emphasized > passages and titles. The text is written beneath the ruled line in brown > ink, although certain passages, titles, and initial letters of Psalm verses > are written in gold on carmine ink. A varied system of marks in carmine or > blue link text and image is in this manuscript.\\" Barber adds that the > (ruling) pattern is relatively uncommon. \\"The text block is ruled for a > single column of text and measures approximately 10.6 cm by 15.2 cm. The > number of text lines varies between twenty and twenty-four; normally these > are consistent within a quire. The Psalter contains 151 Psalms (folios > 1-189r), a unique telve-syllable poem on the early life of David (folios > 189v-191r), a prayer for the abbot of a monastery (folios 191v-192), ten > biblical odes (folios 192v-208r), and a dedication and colophon (folios 207v > and 208r). The Psalms and Odes are numbered next to their titles and the > Psalm text is divided into hathismata and doxai, reflecting common monastic > practice.Numerous initial letters are ornamented, although the significance > of the distribution of these letters is not disclosed by their occurrence.\\" Combinations of Art and Text in the Theodore Psalter Theodore Psalter- Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K. The relationship of icons and text, especially religious text, is an ongoing topic of interest to scholars. > Professor Liz James writes: \\"Art and text, the interface between images and > words, is one of the oldest issues in art history. Are works of art and > writings different but parallel forms of expression? Are they intertwined > and interdependent? > She goes on to ask, \\"Can art ever stand alone and apart from text or is it > always enmeshed in the meanings expressed in the written and the oral that > make it perpetually exposed to subjective interpretation? Byzantium was a > culture in which the interactions between word and image underpinned, in > many ways, the whole meaning of art.
